### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So when you say that the bugs are distracting, what are they distracting from?

**Speaker B:** Pretty much any focus that I'm on.

**Speaker A:** So what kind of focus are you talking about?

**Speaker B:** Well, today I was painting a bookshelf outside, and I'm not very good at painting, and so I have to put a lot of focus into the painting so it somehow comes out properly. And there's armies of gnats flying at me. And, and that, uh, and yeah, it's— is that outdoors? Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, as you can tell, we're outdoors here in Thailand. There's a lot of animals, especially in the evening time. It's sundown. The animals all come out at sundown. It's too hot to fly around, I guess, during the day, so they do come around in the evening. And so put out a mosquito coil is easy enough to do, but you were not talking about painting a bookshelf. You were talking about distractions. While in practice.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, that happens too. I have flying insects all around, including inside my house, and they, yeah, when they land on me during meditation, I find that to be a distraction from the focus.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, there's two then big issues, or let us say two different worlds to look at. One is, is that you're talking about it as if you're infested. Now that may have in fact something to do with the cleaning, that if you clean your house, perhaps there's not going to be so many flying animals, etc. There. So that would be one of the incentives for cleaning up.

**Speaker B:** That would definitely help.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's one of the points that when you get distracted by an insect, you'll say, all right, so where are they coming from? Why are they in the house? That putting a mosquito coil generally throws them out. Or getting, you know, there's modern times that a plug-in that does noise that bothers them and so they leave. So you're not doing much of anything about the animals except not liking them. It's, uh, being annoyed that in fact you've taken those bugs and put them inside your brain. That's where they are, not the bugs on the outside, the bugs on the inside.

**Speaker B:** I like some of the bugs.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I like some of the bugs.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's stay on point. So if you can understand what I'm saying, you can begin to do something about it, to clean up, to put a coil to put something out. There's all kinds of products on the market that can help you. Bug Be Gone or something like that. You can spray, and it sounds like that you've got quite a lot of bugs, more than normal. And you've also complained that You're not cleaning your house, and so when not moving anything, the bugs will find a home. Your house may be infested. There may be one colony someplace under something that hasn't been moved for years. And so just go moving a bunch of stuff around may help get rid of the bugs.

**Speaker B:** They get in through the windows too.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, that's how they originally got in, but once they came in and they liked the place, they came in and made it and have a whole lot more bugs inside.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, uh, there's There's definitely some moth infestations. Uh, I have some wool items hanging around and such.

**Speaker A:** You know, that's one thing that I saw when I was a really little kid was mothballs. People had cedar chests and mothballs, and I haven't seen a mothball in 50 years.

**Speaker B:** I haven't seen one in a long time as well. Remember the smell that they give off?

**Speaker A:** That in fact, people don't use wool much anymore. They all use synthetics.

**Speaker B:** A lot of synthetics everywhere.

**Speaker A:** Well, bugs don't eat synthetics quite as much as they like wool. And there's blends, but even the synthetic blends are better than wool. Kind of amazing that you've got wool. How old is that stuff? Oh.

**Speaker B:** Uh, 20 years at least.

**Speaker A:** So you might want to find a trash bin, get rid of some of that stuff, get rid of the things that the bugs live on and eat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been giving stuff away to some people in the neighborhood. It's— there's still a lot of stuff to get rid of though.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's one side of it. The outside is to take care of the infestations, take care of the bugs, get get some products, do some cleaning, and then there won't be so many bugs. But you're not going to get rid of them all. And the problem is not the bugs anyway. 100 years ago, people dealt with bugs by not dealing with them. Nowadays, people don't like bugs. And so there's all kinds of products to deal with them. So like I said, there's two great big issues. One is the bugs on the outside, but the real issue is the bugs on the inside. It's not a matter of the bugs, it's a matter of that you don't like them.

**Speaker B:** Is there a good way to like them?

**Speaker A:** Actually, I would say that that would be part of the practice of going to being more neutral about them. Actually, the easy way to do that is by becoming friends with them, begin to like them. That when you see a bug, start to notice what kind of bug it is. Begin to name the bugs. Oh, is this a flea? Is this a lice? Is this a gnat? Is this a mosquito? Rather than going immediately to, I hate it, whatever it is. Start paying attention.

**Speaker B:** I like the ants. Ants, I regularly rescue drowning ants and—.

**Speaker A:** Regularly, so you've got an ant infection also, infestation also?

**Speaker B:** Oh, there's, yeah, there's plenty of ants in my house. They're, they're welcome.

**Speaker A:** Um, well, if they're welcome, then so is everything else. I would suggest that you clean out the ants and clean out everything else too. Do some sweeping of the floor. Do some cleaning up for the well-being of your dogs also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and mosquitoes can be dangerous for dogs.

**Speaker A:** Ticks also. Please. And so there's— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dm] Oh, I was saying, fortunately there isn't really a tick problem here. And there's no fleas at all. I think it's the elevation, fortunately.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Mk] All right, so going back to the point that there's two issues. One is the bugs on the outside, And then there's the bugs on the inside, and you call them a distraction. And so when I ask you what was the distraction, you started talking about painting furniture. So let me ask you again, what do you mean by distraction?

**Speaker B:** Okay, this is kind of hard for me to describe. The— if I'm focusing on something and a bug lands on me, it It itches, and that itch is annoying.

**Speaker A:** And— No, the bug itching is not annoying. You choose to become annoyed.

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure why.

**Speaker A:** Because you're in the habit of doing that. You probably became annoyed with bugs. There is a, let us say, a law that comes from the Wiccan religion, and that law is that whatever you think about, whatever you dislike, you draw to you. For instance, that which you're afraid of, you draw that thing to you. And so you're coming to talk to me about not liking bugs, and yet you're living in a situation that encourages bugs.

**Speaker B:** Is— well, wouldn't attracting— yeah, you attract.

**Speaker A:** That which you don't like. Yeah, part of the law of attraction.

**Speaker B:** Why? There is— there purpose to attract?

**Speaker A:** No, there's no purpose. There's no answers to the why questions. It's just that's how it is, that basically you don't like the bugs and yet you're living in a situation that creates bugs.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's— I like ants and I like.

**Speaker A:** Bees, and— We're not talking about the ones you like. Let's stay with the topic.

**Speaker B:** Is there— a way though to convert the bugs, the like that I have for some bugs, to like them all?

**Speaker A:** Well, you could immediately start not liking bees if in fact you were not a beekeeper and yet your house was infested with bees. You wouldn't like them. You would also not like them if a dozen of them spent most of their life buzzing around your head and face. Also, you wouldn't like them if those bees stung you. You wouldn't like it if they nested in your hair. That the bugs that you do like are the ones that you don't deal with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** So let's start back again about being annoyed and disturbed. Distracted. Because this is going someplace, that you become annoyed and distracted. You say that you're doing something. You haven't still answered my question from the original point, is that you're sitting there in meditation doing something or another, and then some itchy crawly bug gets on your skin and you don't like it, and you say that you're distracted. What were you distracted from?

**Speaker B:** Oh, the focus. The focus of whatever I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** So yes, okay, so whatever are you doing? I'm asking you specific questions and you're dancing around it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, uh, well, the, the thing about the, um, paint— the painting I was doing today is— no, let's talk about.

**Speaker A:** When you're not painting, when you're doing what you would call meditation. Oh.

**Speaker B:** So during a meditation, when I itch from whatever the cause of the itch, I feel compelled to scratch the itch. Okay.

**Speaker A:** So what's the distraction?

**Speaker B:** Um, the distraction is the, the pain, the little bit of pain.

**Speaker A:** All right, perhaps I can go this direction with you and describe what happens in correct practice, because in fact you could go so far as to say there's no such thing as distraction with Anapanasati, that whatever is happening, for instance, the itching is not the issue. The issue is that you don't like it, and so you take the time to scratch it, and you're doing that mindlessly, and then you don't like it that you had to scratch it. So now you've got two not likings in a row. One, you don't like the itch, and then you scratch, and then you don't like the scratching because you say that it's distracting you from something. Is this correct?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. So in both cases, you missed the point. And the point is that you did not see that you don't like it. And when you don't like it and you can't see that you don't like it, that means that you don't have any opportunity to make any real changes in the mind. No, you were hinting at, in the sense that some animals you like, that's because they don't crawl on you and bite you. You only don't like the animals that are crawling on you and sting you and bite you. And in fact, you say that you like the ants, but you say also that the ants are on the floor. If the ants were crawling all over your face crawling into your nose, crawling into your ears, crawling into your mouth, you wouldn't like them so much. Is that right?

**Speaker B:** When ants crawl on me, it doesn't bother me so much. I'm more concerned with their safety, so I find some safe place and then blow on my hand or something to push them off. Yeah, so ants don't really bother me.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Ants don't really bother me.

**Speaker A:** Well, what's the difference between blowing the ant off versus scratching the ant off?

**Speaker B:** Oh, um, well, if I scratch the ant off, I could injure the ant, and yeah, I don't want to do.

**Speaker A:** Whatever animal that you're scratching.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— so I don't want to go off into that topic very long, but I'll make a mention of it. And that is, when the Buddha was talking about non-killing of animals, he was talking about significant animals, breathing animals, great big animals, animals like cats, animals like goats and sheep and cows and all kinds of things, birds. But in fact, those are the kind of animals that you take for animal sacrifice to various temples in India or in Jerusalem or whatever, wherever they did animal sacrifices. Or in the case of Hawaii, the daughter of the warlord, right? And that was the animal sacrifice that the Buddha was against. But in fact, one of the reasons why the monks shaved their heads in India was to stop the lice. Because if you're living out in the woods, all kinds of things can start infesting the hair. And in fact, that's one of the problems with the old Indian tradition of having dreadlocks. Is that the hair gets infested with all kinds of animals. And so in a way, not having hair is depriving the animals of a home. Also, when the shaving is done, the razor is more than likely going to be killing a whole bunch of animals. Let's go even further. Suppose that you're sick with a cold and you take some medicine. Aren't you actually killing the bacteria? The antibiotics. So how far into one extreme or the other that are you going to take this? Remember that the teaching of the Buddha is the middle path. And infestation in infestations of lice, bugs, ants, creepy crawlers is not what the Buddha would refer to as killing. Rather, that's cleaning. For instance, if the dog has ticks, then you would put some tick medicine of various kinds, either a shot or the oil that you put on their backs, or perhaps a powder that you dust on them, or maybe a shampoo. But whatever you do to clean the dog, the whole point of it is that you're going to make the dog's body so obnoxious that either all those animals crawl off and go someplace else, or perhaps on the animal they die, they shrivel up. The ticks will shrivel up and die. Now that's not a matter of killing, that's a matter of cleaning the dog. So it's not a matter of killing all of those animals. And so your idea about, oh, well, I don't want to kill ants, that's probably coming from that stupid old Kamma idea about not killing anything, which is actually quite an extreme. That's why the Jains, especially the Jain monks will wear a face mask and carry a broom around to dust, uh, with the broom to sweep the ground that they're walking on. But even sweeping bugs off the path is going to be killing a few of them. So yeah, let's not talk about whether you're killing or not. Let's talk about whether you're cleaning are not. And let's go back to the point that it's not a matter of the bugs that are crawling on you, it's a matter that you don't like them. That the bugs are not crawling on your skin, they're crawling through your mind. You don't like it. So let us say it this way: suppose that you were asleep or in a coma or dead or not aware. A lot of people don't pay attention to what crawls on them, but you are. Then in fact, you've probably gotten super sensitive because you don't like them so much that your skin is probably very sensitive. Well, being sensitive to the body, being sensitive to the skin it's probably a good thing. But this is what Anapanasati really is all about, is to become aware of what the body is doing. But you're becoming aware of what the body has so that you can play, "I don't like you, scratch, scratch. I don't like you, blow, blow," instead of just being aware. That in fact the right, the better way of doing it, that if it's itching, is to put some ointment on. Now the itching may last a whole lot longer than the bug. The bugs will just walk on off, but if they bite you, then there's going to be some irritation that's going to last past the bug. And scratching that while the bug is there, or later it's going to make it much worse. That in fact, because you don't like the itching, you make it worse. Now there's possibilities. One is mindful itching, but the better thing to do is instead of itching, putting on an ointment, nurturing that area that itches. Spend some time caring for it. Here's an example of a product here we use in Thailand. Got it upside down there. Of course, you can't read Thai, but that's okay. They call it Tiger Balm, Monkey Balm. The whole point is, is that it's an oil-based herb collection that has anesthetic qualities to it as well as healing qualities. Aloe vera, anything like that. But you're saying that you scratch because you don't like. So all of this comes back to you don't like it. You don't like the mess in the house, but you don't clean it. You don't like the bugs, but you don't clean them. You don't like the itching, so you scratch, all making it worse, and all based upon the point that you don't like it. And this is where the Anapanasati really comes in, is when you start paying attention to these unwholesome thoughts like I don't I don't like it. I don't like the messy house. I don't like the bugs flying around, gnats and whatnot. I don't like the itchy creepers on me. So what do you do once you start paying attention to the feeling of I don't like it? Now you have a choice about changing it. An example of that would be when you feel an ant or a bug that's crawling on your skin, you can say, "Hot dog, look how sensitive I am." Well, I've trained myself to any tiny little thing that comes on my skin, I'll know it. So it's got nothing to do with the bug, it's got to do with your attitude. And the attitude should be the attitude of beginning to like things. That you like it when you see that you don't like it. Aha, I see that disliking. Aha, I see that I hate those creepy crawlers on me. Because by seeing that and delighting in the fact that you can see that you don't like it, you've actually changed the subject. You've actually changed from the attitude of "I don't like it" into "I like it." Now this is how you would practice. You would practice in the sense of gladdening the mind or brightening the mind by paying attention to how dark the mind is so that you can improve that. To brighten the mind, wake it up, come into a state of 'I like it.' I like that I can find ticks crawling on me, because if I don't catch them crawling on me, they'll start biting. All right, so this is the way that you begin to change your attitude. Because it really is an attitude issue that you have. An attitude about your house, an attitude about where you live, an attitude about all the animals around you. And you do a lot of 'I don't like it,' and you do a lot of 'I don't even know that I don't like it.' I just I don't like it and go do something to try to get rid of it without even paying attention to the feelings of I don't like it. Now the same thing happens with other people when they say, oh, I want a girl, and then they'll go buy a car because they think that if they have that car, a chick magnet, then they'll get a girl. But the point is, is that there is not— it's not even the girl that they want. And when they get the girl, they'll find out that the girl is a real person, not the one, the dreamboat in their brain. And so they bought a car and they've gotten a girl, and they still feel the same way. All right, they still are dissatisfied and they don't even know that they're dissatisfied. And so the whole practice of Anapanasati is to begin to notice your dissatisfactions, because only when you can see your dissatisfactions do you have a choice. That, for instance, when the bug crawls, instead of seeing your dissatisfaction, you just immediately jump to scratching. And the scratching isn't going to prevent the bugs, and the scratching is also not going to make you feel better. And in fact, the scratching is going to continue after the bug is gone. The area still itches. You disrupted the skin. Where that itch is. And so it's going to itch more, so you're going to scratch more. Pretty soon you scratch the hide off yourself, got a great big red mark where you've done all that scratching. And the whole time you miss the point that you're doing all of this because you don't like the sensations on the body, instead of being really happy that you're very sensitive. So go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Would a way to stop disliking it, would that be to focus on each incident and.

**Speaker A:** Always right here, right now, to start focusing on how do you feel, what are your thoughts. Because in fact, the not liking it is influencing your thoughts. So the thought system that you went through to start in doing the scratching, that's actually a thought. It may not be a verbal thought, it may not be a visual thought. It may not be a sound thought, but it's certainly a kinesthetic thought. It's certainly a touch, a sensation. And so there's all kinds of different thinking, and the way that I would define thinking is ever how you spend a mind moment. And so ever how you're spending your mind moments Start paying attention to that, especially when the mind moment is you don't like it, whatever it is. Because if you don't like it and you don't know that you don't like it, you're likely to go do all kinds of damage trying to get rid of it without even recognizing that you don't like it. That's why in the original, uh, before we turn the video camera on, we were talking about just doing one thing at a time to clean the house. Just one thing. But the real point of that is just to get over the fact that you don't like that your house is cluttered and messy. And has been for a long time. Because that's what's really going on. You don't want to clean it because by cleaning it you begin to really see how messy it is. And when it's really messy, you don't like it. So the fact is, is that you're dealing inappropriately with your feelings of 'I don't like it.' And so with Anapanasati, we're going to start paying attention to really what's going on. And scratching is not what's really going on. That's the aftermath of you didn't like that sensation. You don't like it. If you don't like it and you don't know it, you're likely to do all kinds of weird stuff. Mostly with your fingernails, clawing away at it. But if you begin to see that you don't like it, now you can get an ointment out and rub, nurture that wound. And then you were saying that you had chosen an object of meditation, something to focus on, and then this disliking that you have and the scratching that you're doing, you call that a distraction. And I'd like to point out that that's not the distraction, that is the practice to become aware of what's going on. And what's going on is you don't like it because you're trying to focus on something that's probably not important at all, but you've decided that it's important and you should be focusing on that. And the reality is that you've got this disliking in the mind and you don't even know it. You're not being you're not being attentive to the real issues in life. So you wind up spending an awful lot of time not liking this and not liking that, and still have to put up with it an awful lot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was— that's true, I was focusing on the annoying bugs and blaming them, but it's— they're just doing their jobs.

**Speaker A:** Who knows? The bug may not have been doing some job, he may have just been living his life and enjoying the heck out of it. That in fact, when he goes home, his mom and dad is going to fuss at him. When you were on that guy's skin, why didn't you do your job? Well, Mom, I didn't want to do my job. I was just having fun, just crawling around in the hairs. So you don't know what the bug is doing. All you know is you don't like it, and you don't even know that you don't like it. So in the practice of Anapanasati, this is what we're going to be paying attention to, is what your mind is doing. If your mind is in the state of I don't like it, and you don't know that, then you can't change it. And so you're going to get deeply in the habit of not liking it. But when you start to see, I don't like it, now you have a choice, and you can change that choice from being distracted someplace else, or you can begin to look at that 'I don't like it' and begin to change it. Aha, I see that I don't like bugs on my skin. Let me pick that critter up and take a good close look at him to see what he actually is. See, in fact, it's not the animal, it's not the critter that you don't like, it's the itching that you don't like, it's the sensation on your body that you don't like.

**Speaker B:** Is during meditation.

**Speaker A:** Huh? Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh, during meditation, is it— with a neutral attitude, is it okay to brush away the bugs? Or is it more appropriate to just tolerate them and let them stay where they are?

**Speaker A:** Did I say ever that? No, I'm not pointing at that. Can you brush the bugs away happily? Can you brush the bug away without clawing at your skin because you don't like the sensation? But in fact, if there is an itching sensation and you don't like it, can you put some salve on it? Put some medication on it, nurture it, take care of it, as opposed to not liking it. And so you're scratching it and scratching it and making it red and making it worse because you don't like it. Then you don't like what you've done to it, so you scratch some more. It's—.

**Speaker B:** I was taking the attitude that if I'm meditating or doing anything, that the bug is interrupting me, and— But.

**Speaker A:** The bug is not. The bug is just doing whatever the bug is doing. You're interrupting you. And the interruption is because you want something. And perhaps the right thing to do is instead of seeing the bug and its itching as an interruption, see it as, oh, that's what's happening right now. Let's go get some ointment. Let's put some salve on it. Let's get some aloe. Let's get some monkey balm and put that on there. And do it in a nurturing, loving, kind way, because that's the training that you need. Not that you're focused on some pearl or some third eye or maybe chakras or whatever these kind of weird stuff that these gurus off in the desert are looking for, up on the mountain or whatever. That in fact, there's this Buddha boy that was— he started coming around in 19— excuse me, 2004. He was making quite a sensation in India, and over the course of time, he got bitten 7 times by snake. Why? Because he wasn't paying attention. He was too busy going off into outer space or into bliss or whatever he was doing, and he wasn't paying attention to what was going on. Now this is the point, okay? Let us say some of the training would be that the senior monk is going to be walking up behind the guy who's doing meditation. Because if the guy who's doing meditation is so focused on some object or another, a third eye or chakras or Jhana bliss or whatever it is, and the teacher can see that this guy does not know that the teacher's behind him, if he's Zen, he's going to whack him on the shoulder with the Zen stick. These Western folks have gotten really strange ideas about what meditation is, and meditation basically, if you practice it correctly— that's why I don't even like the word meditation, is because the people who are doing meditation are not doing Anapanasati, which is to be here now. So if you've got some object of meditation and you think it's a distraction that the ants are crawling or biting or whatever, then you're missing the whole point. What if it is your teacher that's standing up behind you and you don't know he's there and he whacks you across the side of the head with his fist or hits you with a sen stick or whatever like that because you're not paying attention? So what now you can do is that when you're sitting there doing whatever you're doing, hopefully watching how you feel and what's going on in your life, and start changing that to hold some happy thoughts. And then the animal crawls on your skin. Instead of feeling like, oh, I'm distracted from my bliss, you can say, aha, I see that. Sensation of the ant crawling. Let me take care of that happily, just like you would take care of your Zen master happily, rather than having him whack you, or the bug bite you, or the snake bite you, because you're too busy having some stupid object of meditation to pay attention to what's happening.

**Speaker B:** There was someone who told me about meditation and said to just let the bugs crawl on me and ignore them. And it's so— so then a whole.

**Speaker A:** Lot more advanced than you are is one way of saying it. Because you're not letting the bugs— that in fact, that's letting the bugs, that's paying attention to the bugs and with equanimity just watching them. But you're not, you're too full of 'I don't like it,' so you're nowhere near that kind of equanimity.

**Speaker B:** So, so then at my stage of meditation right now, is it appropriate for me to push the bugs off when I feel them?

**Speaker A:** It's appropriate for you to look at the fact that you don't like them and then deal with them happily. As I've said before, deal with them happily. If brushing them aside, or if it's itching, put some balm on, or whatever you do, you do something more appropriately because you're doing it wisely, because you're paying attention.

**Speaker B:** Is it appropriate to use gratitude? Is that appropriate?

**Speaker A:** Well, gratitude in what way? Oh, I'm so happy that that bug is on me. It wakes me up.

**Speaker B:** It's, um, well, because something that's pretty easy for me to do is to convert my dislike of bugs crawling on me to being having gratitude that I'm able to sense that they're there.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's what I was talking about before. I've already mentioned that. Aha, I'm glad that I can see that. I can— glad that I do have sensitive skin. You're not gratitude to have gratitude for the bug. You have gratitude you know it. But see, there's no reason to have gratitude for knowing it unless you've already got back into a state of liking. But since you're in a state of disliking, the gratitude is not gratitude, it's hatred. So you've got to change your attitude from stop disliking it into start liking it.

**Speaker B:** [No speech]And is, would, and can that be done as it's happening, just change the attitude?

**Speaker A:** There's no other time to do it, you're not going to be able to deal with the scratching and the issues of a bug that happened 15 years ago.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's always right here, right now. What's your attitude? What do you feel? Recognize these feelings of 'I don't like it.'.

**Speaker B:** And would the practice to to recognize that I don't like something and then to say I do like it, or to find something about it that I do like?

**Speaker A:** Find something about it that you do like. Of course, this is the distraction, is to distract yourself out of your disliking. Aha, I see you. That's the way that the Buddha recommended. Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see that I don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes, um, that makes sense. Yeah, that they've, they've been discovered.

**Speaker A:** Because the discovery is something new. They're not liking it is old. That's just old things you've been doing. I wouldn't call it necessarily familiar, though it is. But really, if it's familiar, that means that you know it, but you don't know it. You don't know that you don't like it. So discovering that you don't like it— aha, that's change, that's something new. And once you can see that you don't like it, now you have a choice. You can distract yourself from the not liking into liking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not like the bug is setting out to intentionally annoy. They're— that's not what they're doing.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're setting off intentionally being annoyed. You're just using that bug as an opportunity to be annoyed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's.

**Speaker A:** So when you can see that that annoyance is part of your attitude— it's, by the way, it's a loser's attitude, it's a victim's attitude of being annoyed and loving being annoyed.

**Speaker B:** Oh, like a kind of addiction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's something very interesting, especially like, say, heroin or something, that not only do they become addicted to the high They also become addicted to the crash. Oh wow. Become addicted to the crash. Become addicted to being annoyed. Or an easier way to say it is you're just in the habit of being annoyed. You love it. It's part of your That's why you have a house full of bugs, is to have more and more opportunities to be annoyed.

**Speaker B:** That's Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Looking into the past, I used to be annoyed by a lot, a lot more used to be annoying, um, uh, people who deliberately were annoying, uh, because they wanted some kind of reaction. And it— that source annoyance is actually.

**Speaker A:** Quite an addiction, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** It is. It is. My experience used to be much larger annoyances. Now they're just little annoyances.

**Speaker A:** But well, now it's time to go to— now it's time to start paying close attention.

**Speaker B:** Is our negative thoughts a source of annoyance? Of— guess what?

**Speaker A:** In a way of saying it, that's the only source— negative thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Because when you told me before that emotions are very big things and thoughts are little things, and I kind of imagined like the thoughts are kind of like a missile, and then when the missile impacts, it becomes this big emotion.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Did I— yeah, yeah, just a little.

**Speaker A:** Ant on the skin, just a little bug on the skin, just a little bite, just a little itch. There's nothing to it. What makes it big is you don't like it, and you do like not liking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's a clear example of what you're talking about. The fact it doesn't mean anything is that you don't like that fact. That's what makes it big.

**Speaker B:** It's, um, it would be— it's more difficult to deal with small annoyances than big ones, right?

**Speaker A:** All annoyances are the same. You don't like it. So this is your job, to start paying attention to you don't like it. Start paying attention to your feelings. Start paying attention to these thoughts of you don't like it. Start paying attention to these unwholesome thoughts so that you can change them. You've got a choice when you can see it. You can't see it, you don't have a choice.

**Speaker B:** I would I would say that the majority of the thoughts that I have are unpleasant.

**Speaker A:** Right. So sit down, take a deep breath, and start changing those thoughts to wholesome thoughts. Everything's okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, nothing to do and no place to go, and the spring comes and the grass The grass grows by itself, everything is going to be all right, everything is so hunky-dory, keep with wholesome thoughts. And then watch how easily the mind just bounces right back to where you're in the habit of. And then you say, "Aha, I saw you, I see that," and then come back into having wholesome thoughts again. Practice, practice, practice. Practice having wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** And what would the— would the technique be to focus or to intercept each thought as it's happening?

**Speaker A:** When you say the word focus, that word focus generally comes from two things. One is actually paying attention. But normally people use the word focus in the sense of concentration, and I'm talking about the wrong kind. The kind that is the reason why Samadhi is actually wrongly translated as concentration. Now the better way of seeing this is repeating, repetitive. This moment and the next mind moment and the next one and the next one and the next one after that. Repetition. Repeat. Don't use the word focus. Don't use the word concentration. Use the word repetition. Over and over and over again. Keep repeating wholesome, happy thoughts. And when the mind wanders away into unwholesome, unhappy, I-don't-like-it thoughts, aha, I see that, and I'm coming back and starting having wholesome thoughts and start repeating those again.

**Speaker B:** And with, can enough Wholesome thoughts sort.

**Speaker A:** Of eventually will tip the scale. Exactly. Enough wholesome thoughts. Look how many hundreds of millions of unwholesome thoughts you've had. Let's start counterbalancing. Let's start having wholesome thoughts one after another after another. Let that, uh, cash build up. Keep depositing wholesome thoughts in the bank, and pretty soon you'll be paying off that debt.

**Speaker B:** The debt of the unwholesome thoughts. So I find it particularly easy, for instance, if I smell a flower that smells really good. It's just that the smells of the flower are just wholesome or really— Well.

**Speaker A:** Getting your pleasure out of sensuality though is not what we're talking about. We're not talking about flowers, we're not talking about bugs, we're talking about what's going on in your mind. That you can smell this flowery tomorrow and it doesn't smell nearly as good as it does today. Why? Because your mind is different. Let's say that the bee stung you and you're in violent pain, and now you smell a flower and it doesn't smell nearly as good as it did yesterday when you were in a better mood. It's not the flower.

**Speaker B:** Is, um, would, would that be a way though to create host?

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, no. Looking for pleasure in all the wrong places. Looking for pleasure on the outside. Looking for beautiful things to look at, beautiful sounds and beautiful smells and all of that kind of stuff. Is not what we're doing here. That's what ordinary people do. That's why they're all so miserable most of the time.

**Speaker B:** They can't smell the flower constantly.

**Speaker A:** There's no flower that's there all the time. And not only that, but you'll get bored with it. Let's start practicing correctly, which is changing the unwholesome thoughts. Is so— why can't you hear what I'm saying? You keep coming back to asking more and more nonsensical stupid questions.

**Speaker B:** I'm trying to develop a technique.

**Speaker A:** Don't try. Just listen to what I'm saying. That in fact your mind is full of doubt when you keep crying, you keep wanting to know, and all of that kind of stuff. Can you see that doubt, that uneasy feeling that I don't like being confused, I don't like being in doubt, so I'm going to keep asking a bunch of questions? And those questions you've already asked a whole bunch of them, and you're still confused. Why can't you just say, oh, I don't need to worry about being confused, I could just relax, everything's already okay. The doubt's not happening. Not the doubt is not helping because I'm still in the state of not liking. You come into a state of liking. Can you do that? Can you come into a state of, oh, everything's okay, everything is fine? Start practicing that. Start practicing everything is— do it now. Everything is all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. I can be in a state of pleasure. Don't need a rose, don't need a bee, don't need an ant, don't need anything. I'm okay right here, right now, the way things are. I can train my mind thus. Everything is all right.

**Speaker B:** Is there a way to generate wholesome thoughts?

**Speaker A:** I just showed you that over and over and over again. As soon as you see the unwholesome thought, start generating it. Do it now. Let's hear some wholesome thoughts. Let's not hear confusion thoughts. Let's hear wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Well, everything's fine right now.

**Speaker A:** Everything is fine. Keep going, I'm listening. Repeat, repeat, let's do it, come on.

**Speaker B:** There's—.

**Speaker A:** Everything is all right. Can you say everything is all right?

**Speaker B:** Everything is all right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, everything is all right. That's the whole point. Everything's okay. Can you say everything is okay? I notice you're hesitating. You're not sure. So let's start doing it again. Let's get into the habit of it so that it's easy to say everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Everything is all right. It's— Everything is fine, come on, stop stuttering, let's hear it.

**Speaker B:** It's safe, it's fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's safe, it's fine, no worries.

**Speaker B:** It's—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, come on.

**Speaker B:** Everything at this moment is fine.

**Speaker A:** Wholesome Anapanasati, that you're just waiting around.

**Speaker B:** It's, um, I mean, does it matter what kind of wholesome thoughts?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I've given you already example after example after example, and you're not using any of them. Stop asking questions and start spouting wholesome thoughts. No worries. Everything is okay. Come on, let's go. Let's hear it.

**Speaker B:** This moment is fine. This moment is tranquil. This moment is good. This moment is wholesome.

**Speaker A:** All is well. Keep going, I'm listening. Keep going. You said you're going to meditate. Let's meditate. Come on, let's do it.

**Speaker B:** It's fine. It's good. I mean, is— yes, happy.

**Speaker A:** Don't walk into the doubt. Come on, let's practice. Let's get it going. Let's get a rhythm going. You're very hesitant. Let's go. Is it really that hard to come up with a wholesome thought?

**Speaker B:** It's, um, I'm just trying not to be repetitive with the— Be repetitive.

**Speaker A:** Stop trying to judge. Be repetitive. That's what I've been telling you. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repetitive, over and over again. Everything's all right. Everything's okay. Not a problem in the world. Let's hear it.

**Speaker B:** This moment is good. This moment is tranquil. This moment is safe.

**Speaker A:** Start using some of the words I've been using.

**Speaker B:** Everything is fine. Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Everything— don't get stuck, let's go.

**Speaker B:** Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** No dangers here. Bugs are not dangerous.

**Speaker B:** This is safe. This is happy. This is tranquil.

**Speaker A:** Everything's all right. Not a worry in the world. The job that needed to be done has just been done, which is having wholesome thoughts. Everything that needs to be done has been done. The job is done. Come on, I'm listening. You can make as many good thoughts as I do. Try to keep up with me. Let's have a little contest. For every 5 little happy things that I say, you say 5 happy little things too.

**Speaker B:** This is a good moment. This is a safe moment. This moment is just fine. This moment is happy. This moment is content. This is—.

**Speaker A:** Ah, what a relief! What a relief it is. No place to go and nothing to do and Everything is okay. I'm listening. Come on, let's go. I'm giving you examples and you're not following. You get stuck. Let's go. I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** This is a happy moment. This is a good moment. This is a sweet moment.

**Speaker A:** Don't get stuck.

**Speaker B:** The itching feels good. This is a moment of peace. This is a moment of tranquility. This is a moment of contentment. This is a moment of joy. This is a moment of happiness. This is a moment of calm. This is a moment of sweetness. This is a moment of gratitude.

**Speaker A:** You see, you keep repeating that and begin to feel good. Notice that you're you're already beginning to feel good. You're all right. Everything is okay. So this is how you practice. When that unwholesome thought comes, aha, I see you, and I'm going to feel good right now. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. No worries. The only job I had to do was to see that unwholesome thought, and I saw it. The job is done now. Relax, relax. I'm listening. Come on, let's go. You're on a roll there for a second, then you quit.

**Speaker B:** Come on. This is a moment of joy. This is a moment of tranquility. This is This is a moment of calm.

**Speaker A:** You don't even have to say this moment. You just say calm, tranquility, easy, relaxed, contentment. Everything's all right. All right, okay, come on, let's do it.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, centers on a student's complaint about bugs being a distraction during meditation and daily tasks. The summary of the core teachings is as follows:

**Core Problem: The "Bugs" Are in the Mind**
The discussion quickly moves from the literal insects to the real issue: the mind's reaction. The distraction isn't the bug itself, but the **aversion** ("I don't like it") that arises. Dhammarato emphasizes that the bug on the skin is a minor sensation, but the "bug" of dislike in the mind is the true problem. By reacting with annoyance and scratching, we amplify suffering.

**Two Levels of Solution: External and Internal**
1.  **External (Practical):** Take wise, compassionate action in the physical world. Clean your house, use repellents, remove infestations, and apply ointment to bites. This is not about "killing" but about "cleaning" and creating a conducive environment.
2.  **Internal (Meditative):** This is the primary training. The practice is to **become aware of the aversion itself**. The moment you notice "I don't like this," you have a choice. That awareness is the key insight.

**The Correct Practice: Ānāpānasati as "Being Here Now"**
Dhammarato redefines meditation (Ānāpānasati) not as intense focus on a single object, but as mindful awareness of the present moment—including your thoughts and feelings.
*   When aversion arises, see it: **"Aha, I see that I don't like it."**
*   This discovery is a victory. It allows you to consciously change your attitude.
*   The method is to then **actively cultivate wholesome thoughts** to "distract" the mind from the unwholesome groove of dislike.

**The Technique: Cultivating Wholesome Thoughts**
The core instruction is a repetitive, gentle training of the mind:
*   **Drop "concentration"** on an object; instead, practice **repetition** of wholesome mental statements.
*   When you notice an unwholesome thought (aversion, doubt, annoyance), acknowledge it and then deliberately generate a stream of positive, simple thoughts: *"Everything is okay. All is well. No worries. This moment is fine. I am safe."*
*   This is not about sensual pleasure (like enjoying a flower's smell) but about generating internal well-being independent of conditions.
*   Practice this formally, 10 minutes at a time, several times a day, to build a new habit.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   **Distraction is a teacher:** The itch or bug isn't interrupting your meditation; it's showing you the latent aversion in your mind. That is the material of practice.
*   **From victim to agent:** Stop blaming external conditions (bugs, mess). See how your attitude of dislike creates your suffering. You have the power to change your attitude.
*   **Practice is simple but requires repetition:** The path is to constantly notice unwholesome states and gently, persistently guide the mind back to wholesome, happy thoughts until that becomes the new default.

In essence, the talk is a practical guide to turning everyday irritations into the very path of awakening by using mindful awareness to transform aversion into acceptance and well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary **metaphor** is:

**"The bugs in your mind."** This is the central, extended metaphor. The teacher repeatedly distinguishes between the literal bugs on the outside (gnats, mosquitoes, ants) and the internal "bugs," which represent **the habit of dislike, annoyance, and unwholesome thoughts.** The physical bugs are just phenomena; the real "infestation" is the mental attitude of aversion that the student carries inside.

Other key metaphors and stories include:

1.  **Infestation / Cleaning:** The student's cluttered, wool-filled house is a metaphor for an **untended mind**. The physical infestation of moths and bugs stems from not cleaning the house (not tending to one's mental environment). Cleaning the house represents the work of clearing out mental clutter and the conditions that breed "bugs" (aversion).

2.  **The Law of Attraction (Wiccan reference):** The teacher references a principle that "what you dislike, you draw to you." This story explains why the student, who dislikes bugs, lives in a bug-friendly environment—it's a karmic or habitual attraction to the very conditions that trigger his annoyance.

3.  **Scratching the Itch vs. Applying Balm:** This is a **metaphor for unskillful vs. skillful response**.
    *   **Scratching:** A mindless, reactive, aversion-driven response that makes the irritation worse (both physically and mentally).
    *   **Applying balm/ointment:** A nurturing, kind, and wise response that addresses the sensation with care. This represents responding to discomfort with mindfulness and compassion rather than blind reaction.

4.  **The Buddha Boy Story:** The anecdote about the "Buddha boy" in India who was bitten by snakes seven times is a **cautionary tale**. It illustrates the danger of a misguided meditation practice that seeks bliss or concentration at the expense of **present-moment awareness** ("to be here now"). It warns against being so "focused" that you ignore real-world dangers (or irritations).

5.  **The Zen Master's Whack:** The story of a Zen master hitting a distracted meditator with a stick is used to illustrate a point. The "bug" crawling on you is compared to the **teacher's whack**—both are immediate, present-moment sensations. If you're lost in a meditative object and miss them, you're missing the point of practice, which is awareness of what *is*.

6.  **Bank Account of Thoughts:** The teacher uses the metaphor of a **bank balance**. Millions of "unwholesome" thoughts (dislike, annoyance) have created a debt. The practice of generating "wholesome" thoughts (everything is okay, fine, safe) is like **making deposits** to tip the scale and pay off the debt.

7.  **The Car (Chick Magnet):** This brief story is an **analogy for misguided desire**. Just as someone buys a car thinking it will bring them happiness (in the form of a partner), the student is focusing on getting rid of bugs to find peace. In both cases, the external fix fails because the internal attitude (dissatisfaction) hasn't changed.

8.  **The Missile and the Emotion:** The student offers a metaphor where a **thought is a missile** and the resulting **emotion is the explosion**. The teacher affirms this, linking it to the bug: the small sensation (the missile) becomes a big annoyance (the explosion) because of the fuel of "I don't like it."

**In summary:** The talk uses the concrete, relatable problem of physical bugs as a springboard into a deeper lesson. The core metaphorical framework is **external infestation (untidy house, bugs) = internal infestation (cluttered mind, habitual aversion)**. The stories and analogies serve to contrast skillful vs. unskillful mental habits and to redefine correct practice (Anapanasati) as **awareness of and wise response to present-moment experience**, rather than concentration on an abstract object to the exclusion of life's irritations.
