### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hang on a shekel.

**Speaker B:** No worries, it'll be good as well because I can rewatch it and I can see what, you know, sort of revise it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the best use for it, is so you don't have to take notes. You can take notes when you listen to the recording later.

**Speaker B:** Brilliant.

**Speaker A:** And it's also very important to repeat things over and over again, so that's an issue also. So we had gotten started on the story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and had mentioned that in the beginning of all of this, when he was a monk of about 10 years studying Pali, you know, like the top, he's like in the graduating class of a PhD in Pali studies in that, I think, or maybe he was like 7 out of 9 years of it or something like this, but he was quite late in it. And he was already arguing with the professors. And so he's given an opportunity for a public talk that happened to have been the graduating class of a university of nurses. And in that audience were people who did not appreciate what he was teaching. And so they made a big stir about it in downtown Bangkok, which happened to have been the seat of some of the oldest temples in Thailand or in Bangkok, some of them associated with the Royal Palace, that neighborhood. Okay. And so in In this Sangha Dacessa, or in his trial, where they were bringing him on the charges of breaking the Sangha by teaching something alternate, he was actually able to show in the Pali that what he was teaching was actually correct and true and right along with the teachings of the Buddha. What happened with that was several outcomes, very interesting. One is that it sparked a Pali re-examination in all of the Pali schools, and they went right through it and found out that we had been interpreting it wrong, and that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has in fact been giving the right interpretation of this. While on the other side, there was a whole bunch of very, very senior monks who were sitting back and saying, yeah, we know, we told you, and you didn't listen to us. Us either. All right. And so the outcome of this trial was that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was teaching the right thing to the wrong people, that all along the right and correct Dharma has been known, but it has not been public knowledge and has been kept within the Sangha. Which that particular statement breaks two myths. One of the myths is that the actual teachings of the Buddha have been lost and nobody's been enlightened for hundreds of years. And you probably heard that myth. That's what gives rise to things like the pragmatic Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah. I mean, that's where I learned about Mahasi Ngo-Ting from.

**Speaker A:** And where I speak. And it is a whole flock of losers, of geese. It's a flock of geese that are quacking and flapping their wings, looking for something that's right in front of them. And so, that's also true, in fact, when I say that, that's also Thailand, but Thailand has made a major shift out of the Visuddhimagga, back into the Suttas, including having an entire movement in Thailand. It's become a bit political and there's some things about it, but it's called Anti-Asoke. And what they mean is, let's take things back before the time of Asoke, which was the great-great-great-grandson of King Bhumibol. What's his name? Bhumibol something or another. Maybe Sarambi. Who was one of the kings that was a friend of the Buddha, as well as King Pasenadi. He became actually through that whole family group, they eventually ran out of Magadha and literally took over almost all of what we now know as India, up except into Kashmir. We know that the Buddha was as far away as Delhi, which was about 600 kilometers from Varanasi and Deer Park and Bodhgaya and that area. So anyway, the Emperor Ashoka established Buddhism as the national religion, but by doing so, he destroyed it in a way, because there were so many monks who came in to get the larder of free bowl, free food, free robes, free housing, and all of that by becoming a monk. But there weren't enough teachers to go around. And so the students started teaching themselves, and that's where the split came between the Mahayana and the Theravada. Basically, it's much more complicated than that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they didn't have the experience to go along with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. So Then the Maha Sangha versus the original Sangha. What happened in the story is that because there were so many monks that were outside, they decided, let's get all of the Arahants together and have a Sangha of our own and meeting to reestablish for ourselves exactly what it is that the teachings of the Buddha are. And so they had kind of an entrance exam. There's sort of like passwords or code words. If you know the Noble Dharma, then you'll know how to answer questions and things like this. And many of the laypeople are, let us say, ordinary people know the answers to these questions. But if you've got views or beliefs coming from another religion, then you'll give your views and beliefs and they don't let you in the meeting. And so all of those guys got really ticked off and went and had a bigger meeting. And this all happened in Rajagiri. If the— and the reason that it was held in Rajagiri is because that was the capital and that King Asoka sponsored the conference. So now he had to sponsor even a bigger conference.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So that was the beginning of the split. And that happened a little over 100 years after about 270, 260 BC. That time period is when all of this occurred, as opposed to the Buddha's death at about 407, 406, 410. That neighborhood is where they seem to have traced it down to now that they went looking for it exactly. So with all of that, then the point is, is that even though there has always been an ordinary Sangha of monks. There has always been this inner core, and the question would be, how do you bring new people into the old Sangha so that it can remain and stay sustained for 2,500 years? And basically, that's the story that I'm telling you now about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, is how he made it into the inner core. Right, right. Yeah. Okay. And that is quite an interesting thing that way, because inside of this Sangha, the Sangha were so some of the senior monks that really did know the Dhamma already and had been invited into the inner core. And surprisingly enough, it was very close with in contact with the royal family, that the royalty, the nobility of Thailand and the nobility of the Sangha had already been intertwined for centuries. And so there was a very, very famous monk who was born in 1860 as the son of King Mongkut, and he became a monk while his brother Chulalongkorn reigned for many years and they supported each other. And the king gave then the monks support to reestablish the correct Buddhism within Thailand again. So now we're repeating it again in the 1930s, but it happened then also in about 1910 or so. That time period is the period that we're talking about. And so one of his students then was made— was given the title of— and it's always appointed by the royal family anyway. They call it the Samadhat Sangharaj. Samdhetsangharaj means some— some debt, I'm not quite sure, but Sangharaj, you can see King of Sangha in that word right there. It is Sangharaj. And so his name was Buddha Gosajan, and he's quite famous. You can find him on Wikipedia and other things like this, as well as I've got some other literature about this, but he befriended Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and later came to South Thailand to visit Buddhadasa, and that they then became good friends. And Bhikkhuni took this old, most senior monk in Thailand as his teacher. And yet everybody kind of thinks that Bhikkhuni discovered all of this stuff by himself. No, that's not the case. So both of those myths are wrong. The correct way of looking at it, or if you want to say the correct myth, is that the Sangha has been secret and has been kept inside, aloof, and very, very high quality up to the point of the royal family of Thailand for many centuries. And that I thought that it was just a kind of Thai thing when I was in the US. And so there was an opportunity for me to teach a young Laotian monk who spoke English but not his own native Laotian language. But he did some, and he had family members who were also monks. In fact, he became a monk to take care of one of his uncles who has also retired from the US and had Social Security. So he wants to spend the rest of his life as a monk. Monk in the family says, "That's not going to happen." And the deal was that his nephew becomes a monk so that he can take care of his uncle. Now, that does not happen in Western culture.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Very true.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:BHIKKUNI] Yeah, but it does in Laotian culture because the family connections are that tight. And so, we became friends, the young monk and I, and I taught him the Noble Dhamma, and he goes and rats on me.

**Speaker B:** Oh, no.

**Speaker A:** And the next thing I know that's happening is that I'm invited to travel with them to Denver, Colorado, to meet yet another uncle who is the abbot there and the second most senior monk in the Laotian culture within the United States.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And there they were as surprised to find a fat old white man in the United States that knows the Dharma. And I was surprised to find that any of them knew it, because all of my connections through the Thai culture had always been through, do you know Bhikkhu Buddhadasa? And we just take it from there. But these guys didn't know Bhikkhuni, but they also knew the Noble Dhamma. That's the important point then, that the Noble Dhamma not lost. It's widespread and it's well-kept. And it is almost like the Noble Dhamma is kept like a jewel or like a triple gem inside of an ornate case, an ornate box. It's quite beautiful, quite ornate, got all kinds of doodads and rabbit holes and all kinds of things. And we can call that box, which is actually a puzzle on how to open it. But we call that the Buddhist religion. Ah, okay. Religion is what we give to people, and that if they play with it long enough, maybe they'll figure out which buttons to push. Yeah. And it will open up, and then you can understand what the real teachings are. Right. Basically, how that has always historically happened is, is that the right student has the right— has to has to ask the right kind of questions at the right time to the right teacher. And that's how that door opens, is you've got to be asking the right guy at the right time, the right kind of questions.

**Speaker B:** The right thing at the right time to the right guy.

**Speaker A:** Gotcha. Yeah. But that keeps it very secret. It keeps it high class and noble because most people are attached to their beliefs. And so they don't like the Noble Dharma. That in fact has been enemies of the Noble Dharma. The Brahmins were especially enemies of the Noble Dharma because it was right out in the open in India and they warred against it. Hmm. But it cost them a whole lot of revenue. They've even tried to make Buddhism now a part of Hinduism. So that they can share the wealth with Buddhism, if they can control it and make it part of Hinduism. But the real teachings of the Buddha means that nobody gets any money, there's nothing there. [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Yeah, exactly. [Speaker:ROBERT] And so, it is greed that is the enemy of the teachings of the Buddha. Which is quite widespread in Western Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I completely agree. Yeah, money is definitely the motive in a lot of places. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so to continue the little story about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, he then decided to continue with the permission of the Sangha that now, finally, in the 1930s, it's okay to let the cat out of the bag to the Thai population. And now for many years, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has been the most famous monk in Thailand. He has been the teacher of most of the abbots of the biggest wats in Thailand. And in fact, this current generation that I know of, especially in places like there's a wat in Pattaya, there's wat in Nakhon Si Thammarat, and several in Srotapanna and Chumphon and up as far as Udon. So we're talking about this whole area of this central south Thailand, the biggest wat monks there, I knew them all personally at Wat Suwan Mok. They were all students of Wat Suwan Mok, and those monks now have become quite famous and are now the abbots of the wats throughout South Thailand. That's the kind of influence that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa still has here. Wow. Wow. Yeah. As well as that, there is Yeah, there's a big place in Bangkok. The thing, the property that they have is so large it's got its own lake, and this is in downtown Bangkok. That property is probably worth $100, maybe $200 million. I don't know how much it's worth. I'm just guesstimating. And its backside is on to Chatuchak Park, one of the largest parks in Bangkok, which means that people actually go on to the other side of the lake and and pinch their little umbrella tents and have their own private little holiday.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's very, very common in that. And there's a lot of people involved with him in Thailand. So Achan Poh has consistently wanted me to come to do that. In fact, he's talked about me going back to Chicago and going to Phuket and stay with the monk there, his name is Sakadagami. And so, the answer was, no, we're going to kind of stay home. And so, this is where the idea of the internet came from, is, well, let's go on and start having one-on-one discussions with people on the internet, just like it's done at the Wat. You see, except since it started meditation retreats, the 10-day retreat format started in the 1950s. Buddhism lasted for 2,500 years without ever having a retreat, not like they have in the West, not like they had. It got started as a It actually had political connotations in it in Burma, and that's what Goenka was in. He was in U Ba Khin's group as a student, but then he was exported back to India because he was an Indian, and in the 1950s, the Burmese government threw out all the Indians because they could. The British bought them, all the Indians, to Burma because they could. So there's that whole side of the story, and that's the connection that Goenka has with Mahasi, is that it has the same and similar roots, and so do the 10-day formats. And that's where those things started. But if you go to be a monk, you might be involved with one of the modern retreats, but there doing that since the 1950s, but most monks don't do retreats like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's— that these retreats is a very Western thing, and you can see that you add bed and breakfast and you've got a money-making operation.

**Speaker B:** Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was looking up retreats in the UK and there was like a handful of ones that were by donation. But the vast, vast majority was all like, it was like a couple hundred bucks. Yeah, just for like, even just like 2 to 3 day retreats, like weekend retreats.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, well, 10-day retreats of $200, right, go for it. That's free food, room and board, if that's what you're getting there, is cheap at $200. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you just stay in retreat at $800 a month. Yeah, you can live on— yeah, that's living expenses.

**Speaker B:** Living the dream, on holiday all the time.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you know how to do that. The problem is there's almost no one who goes to those retreats are ready for them.

**Speaker B:** And you know, you're ready for them.

**Speaker A:** Um, we can talk about that at another time, at a later time. There's actually better uses for our for our time than that. But there is a whole lot. Yeah, just a little bit. One of the things is, is that they take everything away from you in order so that you don't have anything to do. Well, that's easy to do for your village kid, because when you take anything away, everything he's got away from, all you took was a stick.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. But your cell phone and your books and your laptop and your notebook and your ballpoint pens and all of the stuff that you use to define yourself and also to time structure is taken away. And now the students don't know how to do time structuring. Dogs know how to structure their times better than humans.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, without all that tech and their gadgets and that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so let us say that being on the diet of having removed all of that stuff from your life for about a month would be a good way to start a retreat. Okay, to go into seclusion a little early. Another thing is, is that the students don't get any preparation at all. They just sign up for— it's like a business deal. 10 days, you start here, you start paying out, it ends here, you stop paying out, you got your money's worth Goodbye, get out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. There's not like further support down the line.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And it's not a Sangha because the students are told to be in silence. And so they don't even get a chance to become friends. We could walk out of there with 100 friends. And in fact, that's what yoga classes— yoga retreats are much better than some of these meditation retreats because you can build lasting friendships. Hmm. Hmm. Have a good boohoo, clean a whole lot of stuff out, and have a few friends to boot. You go to a meditation retreat, you do a lot of crying, and you don't get much out of it. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And because the students are not prepared. So that's enough for that. We can talk about that. What's, what's a better thing to do with our time anyway? Because we can find ways of practicing correctly on the subway, or on the rails of the tallest building in town, when we're looking down and thinking about going over the side. That's another time to get into seclusion, get away from it all, really. So, um, a lot of people have the idea that they have to put a lot of time and effort into meditation and the results will be way down the line. And on the right, correct way of doing it is recognizing that everything has to do with right now, that this present moment and what you're thinking in this present moment is the only thing that matters. And if you could take care of this moment and this moment and this moment and this moment, etc., then what else is there to do? If you can take care of any situation in the moment, then there's nothing— I mean, that's preparation, is when you can handle anything that comes, especially since you've already handled anything that comes and you survived. So you survive it again. Yeah. The only thing that you haven't survived yet that you have to learn how to survive, and that is death itself. And when you get ready for death, then you can live happily.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I mean, what else have you got to lose?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good point, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. So that's a way of looking at it, is freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. Right, right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. That is an interesting way of looking at it, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. In fact, that's the whole point of it. That's what freedom is. That for many years now, the philosophers have spoken of Buddhism as by a negative, that it is a negative path. It is not a positive path. You do not get a savior. You do not get a heaven. You do not get a hell. That in fact, what you have to do instead is drop all of the ideas that you're going to get anything at all. And by dropping, you're actually going in negative. The only way to fly is by being lighter than air.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that means we need to drop our baggage.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And the baggage that needs to be dropped is the baggage that we're carrying at this particular moment, because that's the only baggage that we've got that's keeping us from flying in this particular moment.

**Speaker B:** I like it, man. I like it. I think I can see where this is going a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's actually going right into the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, and it's most specifically talking about practicing the path according— or practicing the path by using Anapanasati. And Anapanasati is the method that the Buddha taught. That this is one of the things that became kind of a point of argument that we got started on with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is when he said that Buddha only taught one meditation. He only taught one. And yet look how much diversity there is in just Western Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we got masses of techniques everywhere. I even said to you that I was trying to, you know, learn, learn a whole bunch of them and find out what works myself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, here's the point. None of them work. If any, any of them that doesn't work doesn't work because it's missing an ingredient, and Anapanasati is the whole package, the complete issue. And it's actually the missing pieces of the puzzles that all of these other guys are missing.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the whole show.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the Buddha laid it out. So basically is what's happened. It is very much like a jigsaw puzzle, and Westerners have got it knit in a box, and it's got a picture of it on the front. And here we are taking all these piece of puzzles and trying to put all of this puzzle together, and we're missing a few pieces. There's a couple of pieces gone. But Anapanasati Sutta, and that is that it's there in the suttas. The Bhikkhu Bhikkhuni points this out and has had several lecture series on Anapanasati. He's wound up at least 4 different books on Anapanasati under his name because it's been translated into English after being transcribed from the audio into the Thai. Okay, so, um, so there's some language and translation issues, and there's also some cultural issues in there. Some of the stuff that he says doesn't make sense— makes perfect sense to the Thai people.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, um, in, in that regard And this is what Ajahn Po is wanting, is that we can actually take this old teaching of the Dharma that's been well kept and well secret and well working and open it to the world, because the world may be ready for it now. There's a whole lot of signs talking about providence and Christian stuff. No, I'm not talking about any of that. I'm talking about the fact that it feels safe. To do it now. The likelihood of me being strung up under a bridge for what I teach is unlikely to happen. Now, in 1920, it could very well have happened in Missouri or in Mississippi. In fact, I know places in Mississippi now that I could get strung up if I went there. Yes, it in fact is quite possible for a Christian preacher to make one statement on the pulpit and be fired out of a job, out of a house, out of a family. His wife divorces him and he's got nothing just by making one statement.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But a foreigner, a fat old happy man walks into town and makes that statement, he's going to get strung up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it has been historically dangerous, but now there are a lot of people that are interested in Buddhism. So now it's time to kind of let it out of the bag, just like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa started letting the cat out of the bag in the 30s. So this is the Noble Dharma or the supramundane Dharma that is missing in Buddhism. Mostly it has to do with, first off, that whatever you believe, that you have ever believed, whatever it was that you believed hasn't really done you any good. Believing something to be true does not help you. Now, what does help you is, number one, making mistakes. And number two, looking at that mistake and seeing what's going on and learning from it. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. That's a major part because that's actually the point of the teaching of the Second Noble Truth is what is actually the cause of Dukkha is something that we are doing. 'Look at what you're doing and then make a change to that,' rather than looking at it from the perspective— because belief always has big grandiose stuff. I mean, you've got plastic Jesus on dashboards, and we've got big Bibles, and we've got sky daddies, and dead men walking, and no-sex babies, and a whole lot of magic tricks going on. And Buddhism has their whole share of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so all of that magical stuff is not what the Buddha taught. That's what people believed before they understood the noble teaching. And so you're going to find an awful lot of black baggage at the front door of the noble teaching. And you're going to have to climb over a lot of baggage, and you might in fact have to climb over some of the people that are guarding that baggage. So, and one of them, one of

**Speaker B:** that, really, it's just been sort of, sort of sifting, trying to, trying to find some way to sift my way to the truth, sift through all the wheat and the chaff, so to speak. And just, well, experiment with things and see what's actually generating results. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The wheat is delicious, and the chaff is angry and pissed off and guarding and making sure you don't get none.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** You can see that in distinction between the Democratic and the Republican Party and US politics. By the way, where are you located? It sounds like you're in the UK.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But you mentioned your friend and he's in,

**Speaker B:** uh, uh, Indiana. Yeah, yeah, no, um, yeah, I met him. I was a subscriber of his YouTube channel and, um, he, uh, he gave me his number and he was like, call me anytime. And we just sort of, uh, sort of hit it off. We started, um I started helping him with his YouTube channel. We made, um, we made, we started making some podcasts together and stuff. I was doing sort of like Q&As like this with him. And, um, and yeah, it was good fun. We just sort of became good friends. I'm gonna go visit him actually, uh, hopefully soon, but with luck, you know, with the COVID regulations, it's a bit, it's a bit tricky and a bit convoluted and all that. But, um, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's good. We need Dhamma, France.

**Speaker B:** Oh, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** There is quite a lot in there about it, uh, Kaliya, Metta, and all of that part. But there's also the whole issue of that, in fact, during the lifetime of the Buddha, that's what they called each other, was friend, tabuksa, which is the roots of that is the word amigo that we have in Spanish. So the One of the suttas is that Ananda comes and says that, I've just heard that friendship is half the Dharma. And the Buddha says, oh no, it's not half the Dharma, not this half or that half, but it's the whole Dharma. This is the Dharma in this, in the sense to become friends with the insight, and then you can become friends with the outside truly. But you can't become friends with the outside until you become friends on the inside. And so the practice then of Anapanasati is the practice of learning to become friends with yourself on the inside.

**Speaker B:** This is interesting, man. This is interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I'm really starting to sort of draw some connections and this is all sort of starting to gel together with stuff I've read in the past and stuff I've heard you say in the past as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right. So basically, we learn as children to think critically, that in fact, the child is criticized. Is his ABCs good enough? Does he know the word good enough? Do they clean up good enough? And it's always around coming up to scratch, and the child continuously feels like a failure. Samsara, but he also learns the judgment and the feeling in the association. Criticism, feeling criticized— that dynamic then we take into adulthood as a pattern. Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sorry, that's my boss from work calling. I think I have to be at work quite soon. So a bit sooner than I expected. He might be showing up a bit here, here a little early, so I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to call him back. But, um, and then I'll hop back on, I'll hop back on this if that's all right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, we can actually just wait. I mean, I can wait on it. Uh, don't, don't quit this call, go to him. Do you have to do that on Skype?

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, you know, no, no, not at all. I'll just, I'll just, um It's on the phone app. Sorry, one second. I'll just hit him up really quick. Yeah, I've got to be at work today, unfortunately. A bit sooner than I was expecting. But if you're free tomorrow, I'd love to continue our conversation.

**Speaker A:** All right, we can continue tomorrow. If you have to go now, that's okay with me. I don't care.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sorry about that.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not, and it's not unfortunate. That's just what you're choosing to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, man, that's true. It is my choice. I do.

**Speaker A:** All right, Robert, well, we will see you tomorrow and we will continue.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Robert (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: The "Secret," Preserved Lineage of True Dhamma**
The talk centers on the idea that the authentic, liberating teachings of the Buddha (the "Noble Dhamma") have never been lost but have been intentionally preserved within a secretive, inner core of the Sangha for over 2,500 years. This contrasts with the common myth that enlightenment has been unavailable for centuries.

### **Key Narrative Threads:**

1.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Role:** The story of the Thai monk Buddhadasa in the 1930s is used as a prime example. He publicly taught interpretations that challenged the mainstream, was put on trial, and successfully defended his views using the Pali texts. This event forced a re-examination in Thai Buddhist schools and confirmed his correctness. The outcome was the realization that the true Dhamma had been known all along by a senior inner circle but kept from the general public.

2.  **Historical Splits and Preservation:** The discussion traces the dilution of the teachings back to Emperor Ashoka's patronage, which led to a influx of monks more interested in material support than deep practice, causing schisms (like the Mahayana/Theravada split). The true Sangha responded by forming exclusive, secretive groups to preserve the teachings, often intertwined with nobility (e.g., in Thailand and Laos).

3.  **Dhamma as a Hidden Jewel:** The true Dhamma is compared to a precious gem locked inside an ornate, puzzle-like box. The box is the outward "Buddhist religion"—with its rituals, beliefs, and cultural baggage—which most people interact with. The gem inside is the supramundane path to liberation. One finds the key through asking the right questions to the right teacher at the right time.

4.  **Critique of Modern & Western Buddhism:**
    *   **Commercialized Retreats:** Modern meditation retreats (especially the 10-day Vipassana model) are criticized as a Western, often commercialized, innovation. They are seen as ineffective because participants are unprepared, stripped of their normal time-structuring tools, and leave without building a supportive community (Sangha).
    *   **Proliferation of Techniques:** The vast array of meditation techniques in the West is contrasted with the Buddha's one comprehensive method: **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing). This sutta is presented as the complete "whole package" that other methods fragment or lack pieces of.
    *   **The Role of Belief:** True progress comes not from adopting beliefs but from learning from mistakes and observing cause-and-effect in one's own mind (aligning with the Second Noble Truth).

5.  **The Practical Path Forward:**
    *   The essence of practice is learning to be a **friend to yourself** internally, which then allows for true friendship with others.
    *   Practice is about **handling the present moment**. Freedom is found by dropping the "baggage" of clinging and views *right now*, not in a distant future.
    *   The path is **"negative"** in the philosophical sense—it's about letting go, not acquiring things, states, or beliefs. "The only way to fly is by being lighter than air."

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a call to look beyond the external trappings of religion and commercialized mindfulness. It points to a living, preserved lineage of Dhamma that emphasizes self-inquiry, learning from direct experience, and cultivating inner friendship through the complete practice of Ānāpānasati, all aimed at finding freedom by shedding burdens in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key **metaphors and stories** to explain the transmission and state of Buddhist teachings. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Flock of Geese:** The speaker describes certain modern Buddhist movements (like "pragmatic Dhamma") as "a whole flock of losers, of geese... quacking and flapping their wings, looking for something that's right in front of them." This metaphor criticizes the idea that the true Dhamma is lost, suggesting these seekers are noisy, confused, and missing the obvious.

2.  **The Jewel in the Ornate Box:** This is the central metaphor for how the true teachings ("Noble Dhamma") have been preserved.
    *   **The Jewel/Triple Gem:** The true, supramundane Dhamma.
    *   **The Ornate Box/Puzzle:** The external, religious trappings of Buddhism—rituals, popular beliefs, and institutions. The box is beautiful and complex, but it's a container and a puzzle. The "rabbit holes and doodads" represent the distractions and complexities of religious practice.
    *   **The Meaning:** The true Dhamma has been kept safe *inside* the religion. People interact with the box (the religion), and if they are persistent and ask the right questions, they can eventually open it to find the jewel.

3.  **Dropping Baggage to Fly:** The path is described as a "negative path" of letting go, not acquiring things.
    *   **Baggage:** Our views, beliefs, attachments, and identities.
    *   **Lighter than Air / Flying:** Freedom (enlightenment/nibbana). The only way to achieve it is to drop the baggage that weighs us down **in the present moment**.

4.  **The Incomplete Jigsaw Puzzle:** The diversity of modern meditation techniques is compared to a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing.
    *   **The Puzzle:** The complete path to enlightenment.
    *   **The Missing Pieces:** The crucial elements absent in most modern techniques.
    *   **The Picture on the Box/Complete Puzzle:** The **Anapanasati Sutta**, which the speaker claims contains the full, complete instructions the Buddha taught.

### **Stories & Historical Anecdotes**
1.  **The Story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:** This is the primary narrative frame.
    *   He was a brilliant monk who challenged the orthodox Pali interpretations in 1930s Thailand.
    *   His public trial backfired; he proved his teachings were correct from the Pali texts.
    *   This sparked a re-examination and revealed that a correct, secret lineage had always existed within the senior Sangha and Thai royalty. The outcome was that "the right and correct Dharma has been known, but it has not been public knowledge."

2.  **The Story of the Secret Sangha:** The speaker claims that alongside the public monastic community, there has always been a secret, inner core that preserved the true Dhamma for 2,500 years. Access is granted not publicly, but privately to the "right student" asking the "right questions" of the "right teacher."

3.  **The Story of King Ashoka:** His mass promotion of Buddhism is presented as a double-edged sword.
    *   It spread Buddhism but also "destroyed it in a way" by attracting people seeking material support rather than truth.
    *   A lack of qualified teachers led to self-teaching and is cited as a root of the Theravada/Mahayana split.

4.  **The First Council & The Split:** The speaker recounts a version of the early schism where the true Arahants held a private council with an "entrance exam" based on Dhamma knowledge. Those who failed (holding wrong views) got angry and held their own, larger council, creating the initial division.

5.  **Personal Story: Discovering the Laotian Lineage:** The speaker shares how he accidentally discovered that the "Noble Dhamma" was also preserved in a secret Laotian lineage in the United States, confirming it was not exclusive to the Thai tradition he knew.

6.  **Critique of Modern Meditation Retreats:** Told as a cautionary story, the speaker criticizes the Western commercial retreat model:
    *   It's a modern, Western invention (from 1950s Burma) unlike traditional practice.
    *   It's likened to a business transaction with no ongoing support.
    *   By imposing silence, it prevents the formation of a true **Sangha** (community of friends), which is presented as essential to the path.

### **Overall Narrative**
The metaphors and stories work together to build a coherent argument:
The **true Dhamma (the jewel)** has never been lost but has been **secretly preserved (in the inner Sangha)** and protected within the **shell of organized religion (the ornate box)**. Figures like **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa** began to open this box for the public. In contrast, many modern seekers are like **geese** looking for what's hidden, and many modern practices are like **incomplete puzzles** or **business-like retreats** that lack the essential elements (the complete path of Anapanasati and the true friendship of Sangha) needed to access the jewel. The ultimate goal is to **drop one's baggage** through present-moment awareness to become "lighter than air."
