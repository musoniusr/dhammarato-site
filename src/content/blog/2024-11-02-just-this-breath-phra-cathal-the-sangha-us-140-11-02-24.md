### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This is the Friday evening US Sangha call. Currently, Dhammarato is feeling a bit weak and having a lack of appetite, so we've asked Pra Khetal to lead today's call. I'll let you go ahead and take it from here, Kat.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I suppose we have a few questions. Me and Ivan were just talking about the fact that he finds himself slipping into the same old, same old, using the phone a lot and stuff like that, and about the excuses, you know, like when you start to see the unwholesome how it is we continue to feed the unwholesome. A lot of unwholesome thoughts are just sort of excuses to continually take part in that behavior, you know, that unwholesome behavior. Oh, I want to do that again. And the reason why you should. And I mean, I've been— I could say I've been a victim to that for a long time, making up excuses. And he also said he needs sometimes to feel like someone to shout at him. To stop it, you know, like almost like you take, you know, you tell a parent, or sorry, a parent would tell her child, you know, stop doing that, you know, don't eat the Lego piece, you know, if something you have to shout at the bad behavior of the children. But I think that would be, you know, a lot of the purpose of the Sangha is to keep each other in check. And that's one of the great benefits of the Sangha is to to have that support and community. But really, like, when it comes down to your practice, it's not that you really have to shout at yourself, but again, you really want to start recognizing, is this satisfying or not, rather than kind of getting angry at yourself or getting mad at you constantly going back to the old ways, the old habits. It's not about that really. Because that's going to happen anyway, you know. But the fact is, every time it does happen, like, you really, really want to see, is this satisfying, is this dissatisfying? That's the key, is the clarity on whether or not these things are actually making you happy or not. And the more you see it doesn't make you happy, you're just going to naturally let it go. But it's an old habit, that's really what it is. It's just an old, old habit. And these things take time, but you continually want to practice and practice again and again, remembering to switch those thoughts to the wholesome, you know, when those come up, those excuses, you know, the kleshas, the defilements, they're like a little excuse fabricating machine. They just have excuse after excuse about why and the story, and then you just remember, aha, I see you, I see you, you know, that's not me, that's not mine, that's just the nature of the defilement. But it's not much to do in regards to the situation that you're in your house or you're in your car and you have your phone. That is not important. But it's just being here now and remembering to look and see, you know, see the fact that these thoughts are— the mind is inclined to just look at the sugar, to get what it wants, to get the gratification. But if you maintain the fact that's not good for me, then you probably will be more inclined to not give in to it. And you'll see it just passes away and that was no big deal. So it just takes more practice, you know. So that's my answer for Anagami, you know.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** And Luke's question was about the uncertainty and the unknown. Right? Something about that? What to do when you feel the uncertainty of not being sure about what to do, or the unknownness of where life, what life is, what's happening in life right now, and stuff like that? Or was there more to it than that?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what he asked, basically. It's crazy to know, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I'll just give you my experience, but I hope other people can share their experience about how to deal with the unknown feeling. It's an interesting thing, like, you know, the more you come into the present moment without Having a sense of going anywhere, getting anything, going to any particular place, or wanting to change anything, it is mysterious. I think we talked about this even last week in our small little group. The fact is, the present moment is very mysterious, you know. It's very mysterious. And it takes a certain level of comfort with that sense of not being sure what's going on and being okay with the fact you really don't know what's going on. I mean, I'm just projecting, you know. I don't— that's how I feel. I just don't know what the hell is happening anymore. And there's a sense of, you know, it's kind of— it comes down, it can be very terrifying. It can go quite deep into that sense of you just don't know what's gonna happen. But there's a certain enjoyment of it because you realize it's so much better to enjoy the mystery of the present moment rather than the restless, trying to figure it out, trying to make a plan all the time about what should happen, where you should go. And you always wanted to fix it a certain way and avoid all of the discomforts and things you don't like, rather than just being open to— yeah, you don't really know what's going to happen. And that also takes some work in the sense of when we do have intentions to be here now to see through some of the pollution that can be associated with that intention. So sometimes there's pollution in the attention, that there's still a sense of, well, I'm here, but I'm still sort of, you know, I'm hoping, I'm wishing things will go a certain way. And sometimes they're a little bit in the background, but if you do sort of see that too, there is this real genuine sense of not sure, you know, that's about it. It's just not sure. And then there's a, well, now what, you know, there's always that thought about now what, now what should I do with my life. But it's always about being satisfied with the fact you don't know. It's not about figuring anything out. It's just continually being okay with all of these feelings that come up. Even the word— the Buddha referred to himself often as— he usually didn't talk about himself in the first person, you know, never said, hey, I am the Buddha, or anything like that. Sometimes he would say, I am the Awakened One, but that was very rare. Usually called himself the Tathagata, which usually is translated as the one who is here now, or sometimes the translations is not going or not coming or not becoming. And the stage of just being here is also intertwined with the skill of not getting caught up in that old habit of going into unwholesome states again and again, going somewhere where really is the defilement wants to go. Was to be fed again and again. So there's a certain amount of wisdom to be here now and to constantly see the mind, to be watchful, mindful right here and now. Where does the mind want to go? What does the mind want to get away from? It's always in this dualistic, I want something and I want to get away from something. It's almost like a binary code in which the mind works. It just wants to get something and go somewhere, or wants to avoid something, which will also be an action of doing something to get away from something. So we're kind of both in that same boat. So it takes a skill to actually be here, be comfortable, and see, you know, everything's okay. That's the attitude of, yeah, everything's actually okay right now. And also what I like to say is like baking into that process, not just like putting the bread in the oven, but actually baking into the present moment, getting really satisfied, staying away from all the unwholesome. And then we can also say it's a kind of like an immersion into the present moment. And I fairly recently listened to a talk by Ajahn Thanissaro where he talked about the fact the present moment is not the goal itself. But when we're here now, you know, this is the time to get really baked into the present moment. It's not just on the superficial kind of ground level. You really want to like be here now and get the mind straightened out right now. You wake up right now, make a change, you know, like that. Getting the ball rolling whenever you remember to. So it's not just about the present moment, but using it to develop staying here now and having the skill to stay here now. That's my— I mean, that's what I think.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, good help.

**Speaker C:** Thank you. This, yeah, I just— I know that my mind really loves to plan things and like constantly Um, it's this want to know. I mean, I mean, yeah, it's just all over the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course, these are all habits here. These are all habits. That's all, really.

**Speaker C:** Not running away from that uncertainty and just being okay with that. It's just crazy how much I need to remind myself. It's almost like once my mind goes there and it understood, oh yeah, I've been here many times. We can be actually really okay with that. That's where my mind, you know, is able to, you know, just bake into this present. But, you know, it's almost like I have to enter the door. If like the door is open and I can smell how nice it would have been if I entered the door, but the mind is like very resistant, it's like, like you said, it's old habit, it's very scared. He wants to know the future, whatever. But, you know, it's like once I enter that door and I know, oh yeah, I've been here, yeah. But I just— no matter how much I remind myself, it doesn't make sense sometimes. But once I enter the door, then it makes sense. And it's kind of frustrating, like the effort— it feels like a lot. It feels like there's a lot of effort needs to be done, but once I enter the door, like, the effort is already there. It's frustrating. It's the Kilisa. They just make some buzz of my skill. It's so frustrating.

**Speaker B:** It's what they are. It's all they ever do, you know. But, you know, with the effort, it's interesting. It's certainly the fact that it does take effort. It does feel like a lot of effort in the beginning, but there is some point where that initial, let's say, exertion of effort becomes a sort of energy itself. It almost switches from effort to energy. It's like you've got the ball rolling, there's not much to do, it's just going itself. And that's where the practice becomes very fun, I would say. Not so much fun in the beginning because there's resistance and there's this continual sense of, I have to put the effort in, I have to go again, oh, another, you know, like sort of like that. But the more you practice applying that again and again and again, over and over, it becomes an energy itself. And that's an important— I would say that's kind of the fulfillment of the Noble Right Effort, the fact that it becomes an energy itself. It's no longer effort. It's just a kind of— you're just here and it's, you know, things have become fun, a real, you know, sort of game to play. But again, it's important to know that if you're not hitting that point, it may be because, again, you have to keep putting the effort in. Don't slip away back into the unwholesome. You have to keep again and again and again. Just— I have some people used to say, fake it till you make it. I've recently heard people say, gaslight yourself. I like that. Because that's what it is really. You have to do, sort of put the effort in again and again until you make it. And you know for certain, I mean, it won't be a sort of, oh, have I made it? Have I? It will be crystal clear that things have become a lot different than they initially were. That what took a lot of effort and what took what seemed very difficult is now it's nothing, you know. It's just that throwing the ball around. It's not like a rock, you're throwing a baseball around. So that's what right effort is, it takes the burden away. But in the beginning, yeah, it does feel like a bit of a burden. Can feel like that, but again, you start to notice the things themselves are not burdens. It's often our attitude towards things generally that makes it feel like a burden. But yeah, it's a bit of a burden when you're just starting to change from the unwholesome to the wholesome. But it's just the nature, yeah, it's the nature of spending your whole life doing a particular set of habits and then going against that. I mean, it takes effort, yeah, it's like learning an instrument or, you know, all people, they generally are very resistant to learning new things. Even I've noticed myself now, I get a little bit more resistant to like learning things. And even learning Thai or something like that, really, I hate learning languages, but I just do it. And now it's like, oh, this is kind of fun, you know. So it's just that sense of resistance. And I'm sure there's something in them going on in the brain that actually is giving us that initial strong resistance because we have been going down the same path to the same.

**Speaker C:** Uh, yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S like a path in the forest, you know. You walk over to thousand times, it's like, you know, well laid out, and then suddenly you want to take another direction, it's like full of weeds and thorns, and it's not clear where to go. I mean, we don't like that. We like the easy way out. But you do have to kind of straighten yourself out as to what direction is the direction to go, and then build a pathway in that right direction, which is the Dhamma. You really want to develop a strong familiarity with what is, you know, the right way to go about things and then keep developing that because that's the new path you want to take. So there's resistance. It's not easy, but yeah, that's the way. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I understand that. It's just really because I drop the balls and I go into the unwholesome So the effort to wake up again, it's like, wow, it's— well.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's just one thought. You can just remember many times it's just literally one thought at a time. It's not a big deal. We often have to— we often think about seeing it in a sort of a perspective of this is a big period of time and a big journey and a big deal. But in the actual practice, it's literally just one thought at a time, just this breath. I mean, it's so hard to just— it's hard, yeah, to think about, oh, just staying with this breath for the next hour. But rather, if you just stay with the breath right here and now, it's not a big deal. It's always about the sense of approaching what you're doing, you know, like the attitude to what you're doing. That gives you a kind of a friendliness to it, or you can make a burden for yourself. It's really that choice, whether you just want to have the simplicity of having a wholesome thought, or, oh no, I have to have 10,000 wholesome thoughts, that's my goal.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I understand that it's like, uh, these opposite of middle way. Like, my, my mind goes back to that place where it's, oh, I need like 500 wholesome thoughts too. That's a lot of work, but yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have to do all this work and then I'm gonna feel good. And he's like, no, no, no, it's just immediate. And then see how good you can feel. It's just like that. This feels really good. This thought that everything's okay feels really nice. And how good can I make that feel? Just make it a game, you know? Instead of, oh, I have to do this and then I'll feel good, or, oh, after I do this again and again, I have to go through all of this. Practice, I have to reach this stage, I have to attain this thing. Like, all these thoughts are the kind of Western fascination or infatuation with progression and, you know, going step to step to step to this stage, to that stage. But that's not how it plays out. It really doesn't play out like that. These things sort of happen themselves if you're have the attitude of just being here is enough. Being with the wholesome is enough, you know, hanging out with the wholesome. That's how I like to think about it. I generally don't actually think I'm going to practice meditation. I just think, all right, now time to just hang out a bit, you know, hang out with my breath, enjoy it. And when the unwholesome comes up, I just go back to hanging out. That's That's the attitude, and it works very well for me. It's not like I have to do something very important and get some special insight or some special state. We'll see what happens. These things may happen, but it's not like the goal or something.

**Speaker C:** It's like making the bar very low, right?

**Speaker A:** Like.

**Speaker B:** It'S throw away the barrier. Go have a high or low bar. Just be here and enjoy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Because if you think about it, you know, like if you have to— but yeah, yeah, like these kinds of thoughts, uh, throwing idealism and, and having a rule of standards and stuff like that, I've never actually found it beneficial to have holding myself with the standards. It doesn't, it doesn't help with my practice. Too much, you know. And idealism has always made my practice harder, having idealistic thoughts about, well, I should be really, really, you know, like this, and I want to get— I want to be the best at that. And I, I have a habit of doing that myself, uh, probably because I had a really competitive house growing up. I mean, there's so much competition for my brothers, so I have this sense that I have to be the best at everything. But I've never had once in my life practicing Dhamma. So I've sort of just taken all that away and seen the benefit of doing that. It's so nice to take all that weight away. The skill and profoundness of much of the practice is just in the nature of repeating it again and again and again. It's not in any particular model or framework of it being insightful, the Dhamma being deep. Or the Dharma being mystical or something like that. It's just the repetitive nature of applying and sustaining your mind into the wholesome, because it's so against the grain of our tendencies to be unwholesome.

**Speaker C:** I start to think that it's kind of beneficial to know the conditioning, like, because for me, I kind of— I mean, it's a bit similar because growing up in an Asian household where I expected to be something, be somebody, anytime I have the thoughts to, like you said, like this Anicca, it never goes well for me. So it's sort of like I really have to go the opposite way. Is it? I didn't think so.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you mean by the opposite way, what do you mean by that?

**Speaker C:** Well, basically like what you said, like just dropping the standard altogether.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but I would say that's different than going the opposite way. That's just going nowhere. The opposite way is kind of rebelling against that. And I also remember I used to do that a little bit. You know, I used to be a bit more sort of rebelling against that. Oh, I should be all posh and all nice. Instead, I'm going to be all over the place and getting into trouble all the time. I just love rebelling. I don't know why, but That's going the opposite way. That's sort of creating another— in many ways, that's creating another burden for yourself. That's following the low bar. You don't want to have low standards for yourself or high standards. It's just being here with reality. There's no bar. There's no good or bad, really. You know, it's just things are. And it's the same with yourself. And what you are is just what you are. It's not good or bad, it's just people around you are still caught up in that whole mindset that this means this and that means that. So they're going to start projecting that onto you. And especially when you're around that all your life, really feels real, you know, it feels real because we believe it. And once you believe, the power of that placebo is not, you know, it's no joke. I mean, you really create the way you feel. The mind is the forerunner. We are creating the way we feel, so we have to wake up to that. It's quite part of this process of practice, is, you know, waking up to the fact that we are creating the way we feel through our thoughts. So as you take control of that, you want to let all that go, you know. But letting it go really means when it comes up that you no longer want to play those games anymore. You see, it's just, uh, it's just empty, you know. There's nothing there. It's just some bullshit, some shit someone made up. Yeah, that's all it is. But if you buy into it, then you're going to feel it. It's going to feel real. That's all it is, is remembering the Sati. That's why we practice Anapanasati, to get our mind— let's say, as Bodhisattva would say, it's like sort of getting it fit for work. I mean, to see that stuff continually, see it arising, arising, arising, and not getting caught up in the whole game, you know. Or sometimes in other traditions— well, not other traditions, but sectarian kinds of traditions— you often hear the word deprogramming, deprogramming out of the matrix or something like that. But it's true in a way, that's sort of deprogramming the mind through all of the various things running on through that early conditioning that we all went through. Arya. Thank you. Does anyone else have any kind of question or something, or anything you want to talk about?

**Speaker D:** Hi, Katal. Greetings from Boston. Hello, man. Uh, you just have such a nice vibe.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, bro.

**Speaker D:** I feel you're so at peace with yourself.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Well, thank you. I appreciate you.

**Speaker D:** And likewise, thank you for being on the call. I hope Dhammarato is better soon.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we'll see, you know, we'll see. I hope so too.

**Speaker D:** About resistance. Seems that my whole goal in life is resisting. I have a condition where I just, whatever people want from me, I.

**Speaker C:** I.

**Speaker D:** Don'T— it's called— there's a name for it. Do you ever feel that you're put upon when demands come to you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And you just— how do you— it seems that— but you don't resist, right?

**Speaker A:** You.

**Speaker B:** Know, my worst habit is rebelling against everything. I don't know why. But whenever someone puts their expectations on me, I usually get very like a dog. I start barking back at them. But nowadays it's more like sort of seeing that people are just mostly in a state of wanting something. And when you have gotten more relaxed within yourself, you just see it, you know. You just see the continual craving and people want something from you. And what I've realized is stay away You know, just stay away from people because they're going to drag you into their world of defilements, and you just want to stay away. You don't want to make a big fight about it. I mean, it depends on your situation, yeah, but that's how I deal with it. I just stay away. I mean, I don't do it like in some kind of black or white fashion. Of course I have to deal with people, but as best as I can, I'll stay away. And I'm focused on straightening my mind now. I don't want to buy into all these things.

**Speaker D:** But how about the basic demands of life? Life is always demanding. We got to eat. We didn't— do you feel that you— I feel that, you know, we didn't— I didn't choose this— well, I think I didn't choose this incarnation, but I feel that I resent the fact that life is always demanding. Life itself is always demanding of me. Then is that not a problem for you?

**Speaker B:** I mean, you just accept that this is part of life and you don't, yeah, you don't have any sense of wanting it to be different. Because the fact that this is required, that's all you do is accept it. And whenever you see yourself, oh, I wish it wasn't like this, see, that's really a delusional. That's when we talk about delusion. It can be rooted in this completely dysfunctional sort of idea about reality. Oh, you know, why is this like that when it's always been like that? Why should I have to exercise? I just want to sit on my ass all day or something like that. But the fact is we have to sort of tune ourselves in with reality. The body does need exercise, it does need healthy food. I do need to drink a fair bit of water, you know, and stuff like that. You just accept that. Even pain in the body, there's pain and there's sickness, people are dying, and you just accept that. It's part of nature. You have a thought about it, really, it's just, oh, that's the way it is. You could say that's pretty much all Dhamma, wanting nature to be different, but Once you understand the cause of something, let us say the cause of the Dukkha in that situation is, oh, I have to eat, oh, I have to do all this work to eat, oh, I have to make a living to eat. Well, yes, I have to eat, and I'm going to do something about it. So we just switch from thinking in a problem into thinking in solutions all the time and keep your mind wholesome. That's the goal, you know. That's the practice, keep the mind in a wholesome state about the way things are, because that's the way things are. And if you go against that, you will experience bad feelings. Go with the flow, as they say. So yeah, that's what I think about that.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** This is just, you know, Arahant always say not sure, right? I find that to be very helpful, but sometimes I'm curious, can I take it too far? Like, isn't life better when you have some certainty of how things should be. Like you described your experience lately, it has been like you're not even wanting to know what's going to happen next. And I know that there's a part of my brain still wants to know, right? So just seeing that, right, I think I'm just answering my own question here. Just seeing that that's just how the mind is, it's an old habit.

**Speaker B:** Let's say Ajahn Chah would also say that wanting to see certainty in that which is uncertain is surely going to cause you Dukkha. You have to remember that this desire to find certainty in things that are completely probabilistic is just a recipe for some bad feeling. You know, if you assume or put expectations on things that are always changing all the time, for sure you're going to have bad feelings. But generally, these things are really unconscious most of the time. How we expect and assume things to be a certain way. That's why we practice Sati, having Sati, Anapanasati. And many things are certain, you know. I mean, there's gravity, you know, there's laws of nature. There's— I know I'm going to probably eat. It's highly likely tomorrow I'm going to eat. But how affected am I by if I'm not going to eat, for example? So there's things not to worry about. I know I'm going to take another shit, probably. Maybe I fall off my kūki and die, I don't know, you know. But you can definitely accept certain things are very likely to happen again and again and again, but there's so much that you're completely uncertain of, like the next thought. What's your next thought gonna be?


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Pra Khetal (Speaker B) in Dhammarato's absence, focuses on two core themes of Buddhist practice: overcoming unwholesome habits and finding peace with uncertainty. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Main Theme 1: Dealing with Unwholesome Habits & Excuses**
*   **The Problem:** The mind habitually fabricates excuses to engage in unwholesome behaviors (like excessive phone use), driven by craving for gratification.
*   **The Wrong Approach:** Getting angry at yourself or needing someone to "shout" at you to stop is not the solution. This creates more struggle.
*   **The Right Approach (The Key Insight):** The practice is to **clearly see in the moment whether the action is satisfying or dissatisfying**. With repeated, clear seeing that it is *not* satisfying, the habit naturally loses its power.
*   **Practical Advice:**
    *   See unwholesome thoughts as impersonal "defilements" or "excuse machines"—not as "you" or "yours."
    *   Gently switch attention back to the wholesome (e.g., the breath, the present moment).
    *   It's a matter of building a new "path" through repeated practice, which feels difficult at first but becomes easier.

### **Main Theme 2: Embracing Uncertainty & The Present Moment**
*   **The Problem:** The mind craves certainty, plans constantly, and resists the inherent mystery and unknown nature of life.
*   **The Wrong Approach:** Trying to figure everything out, make rigid plans, or avoid discomfort.
*   **The Right Approach:** Cultivating comfort with "not knowing." The present moment is inherently mysterious, and peace is found in being open to it.
*   **Practical Advice:**
    *   **"Bake into" the present moment:** Immerse yourself in it with satisfaction, without wanting to change it.
    *   **See the mind's binary habit:** Notice how the mind constantly wants to get something or avoid something. The skill is to stay put without following those impulses.
    *   **Adopt the attitude:** "Everything is actually okay right now."
    *   The goal isn't just to be in the present, but to use it to develop the **skill of staying there** with a wholesome, settled mind.

### **Supporting Insights on Practice & Effort**
*   **From Effort to Energy:** Initial practice feels like a burden of effort. However, with consistent repetition, it transforms into a self-sustaining **energy** and becomes enjoyable—like a game or "hanging out" with the wholesome.
*   **Drop Ideals and Standards:** Setting high (or low) bars, competitive thinking, and idealistic goals about progress create unnecessary weight. The profound change comes from the **simple, repetitive act** of sustaining the mind in wholesome states.
*   **One Thought at a Time:** Don't see practice as a huge, daunting project. It's about **just this breath, just this wholesome thought** right now. Make the bar very low.
*   **Deprogramming Conditioning:** Practice helps "deprogram" the conditioned beliefs and standards imposed by society and upbringing. You see these thoughts as empty and stop buying into the "game."

### **On Dealing with External Demands & Resistance**
*   When feeling "put upon" by others' demands, the skillful response is to **see it as their craving** without getting dragged into it. Practically, create healthy distance where possible and stay focused on your own mental cultivation.
*   For life's basic demands (needing to eat, work, etc.), the solution is **acceptance**. Resistance ("why do I have to?") is delusional and causes suffering. Shift from seeing problems to implementing solutions while keeping the mind wholesome.

**Overall Tone:** The talk emphasizes a gentle, persistent, and investigative approach. The path is about **clearly seeing what leads to suffering** and **cultivating a satisfied, okay-ness with the present**, letting go of the mind's compulsive habits through patient, moment-to-moment practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers, primarily by **Speaker B (Pra Khetal)**:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Parent Shouting at a Child:** Used to describe the feeling of needing external discipline to stop unwholesome behavior. The example given is a parent telling a child, "stop doing that... don't eat the Lego piece."
2.  **Excuse Fabricating Machine:** Describes the defilements (*kleshas*), which constantly generate excuses to continue unwholesome habits.
3.  **Baking into the Present Moment:** A central metaphor for deepening practice. It's compared to putting bread in an oven—you don't just superficially notice the present, you immerse and "bake" into it until it transforms.
4.  **Immersion:** Similar to baking, it describes a deep, settled abiding in the present moment.
5.  **Binary Code:** Describes the mind's basic, dualistic operating system: wanting to get something/ go somewhere, or wanting to avoid something.
6.  **Getting the Ball Rolling / Throwing a Ball:** Used to describe Right Effort. Initially, it takes effort to start (get the ball rolling), but once momentum is gained, it becomes effortless energy (like throwing a ball around).
7.  **A Path in the Forest:** Compares old habits to a well-worn, easy path. Choosing a new, wholesome direction is like forging a new path full of weeds and thorns—it's harder and meets resistance.
8.  **Hanging Out:** Presents meditation not as a formal task but as casually "hanging out" with your breath or with wholesomeness.
9.  **Gaslighting Yourself / Fake It Till You Make It:** A modern, somewhat humorous metaphor for the initial phase of practice where you consciously choose wholesome thoughts even if they don't feel natural, until they become authentic.
10. **Deprogramming / The Matrix:** Refers to the process of undoing early conditioning and societal programming through mindful awareness.
11. **A Barking Dog:** Speaker B uses this to describe their own old habit of rebelling and "barking back" when people place demands or expectations on them.
12. **Going with the Flow:** A common metaphor used to describe accepting the basic demands of life (eating, working) without resentment, aligning oneself with reality.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Personal Habit Story (Speaker B):** He shares his own history of being a "victim" to making excuses for unwholesome behavior, providing a relatable example for the first question.
2.  **Learning Thai Story (Speaker B):** He uses his own resistance to learning a new language (Thai) as an analogy for the universal resistance to forming new neural pathways and breaking old habits.
3.  **Competitive Household Story (Speaker B):** He shares that he grew up in a very competitive environment, which led to a habit of idealism and needing to "be the best." He contrasts this with the Dhamma practice of dropping standards altogether.
4.  **Asian Household Expectation Story (Speaker C):** Luke briefly relates, echoing Speaker B's story, that growing up in an Asian household with high expectations created a conditioning that makes the practice of "not knowing" (Anicca) particularly challenging.
5.  **Rebellious Phase Story (Speaker B):** He mentions that he used to rebel against expectations by "getting into trouble," illustrating that rebellion is just the opposite extreme and not the Middle Way.

### **Doctrinal & Conceptual References (used as foundational "stories")**

*   **The Tathagata:** Speaker B explains that the Buddha often referred to himself as "Tathagata"—the one who is thus gone/thus come, or simply "here now"—to illustrate the ideal of non-clinging and abiding in the present.
*   **Ajahn Chah's Teaching:** Referenced indirectly with the idea that "wanting certainty in the uncertain is a cause of *dukkha* (suffering)."
*   **Ajahn Thanissaro's Teaching:** Referenced to clarify that the present moment is not the goal itself, but the place where the work of straightening the mind is done.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently serve to demystify practice, emphasize the gradual and repetitive nature of habit change, and encourage a light, playful, and non-idealistic approach to being present and cultivating wholesomeness.
