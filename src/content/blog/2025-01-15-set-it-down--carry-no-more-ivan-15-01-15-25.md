### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I'm starting it now. Okay. Yeah, so yeah, Dhammarato, I was— you mentioned about confused feeling a lot, about understanding how is one feeling. If I understand correctly, it's understanding really clearly that I'm liking this, I'm disliking this, right? Like, if I like this, then I know that I like this. If I dislike this, then I know that I dislike this. Is that what you always tell us to be aware of?

**Speaker B:** Say what? Be aware of what?

**Speaker A:** Be aware if we are liking this and be aware if we are disliking this.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you know that you like it, that's what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about. It is wisdom at the point of contact, because then you have a choice, but you're one step further along Be aware of what you feel because you can still change what you feel.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if I think of Lucky, that doesn't mean I have to feel guilty about she dying, nor do I have to feel sad because she died. I could just say, hi Lucky, goodbye Lucky. Don't think about it. The more you think about a dead dog, the more you're going to feel sad, the more you're going to miss her, and the more guilty you're going to feel. So when you see that you're thinking about her, stop. That way you don't have to have any feelings. Yeah, you have feelings. Have happy feelings. Wow, I'm really glad that you were in my life for a few years. I really enjoyed playing with you. I really enjoyed how much you loved me, but you're dead now. Goodbye.

**Speaker A:** Makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker B:** What about—.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, let me think for a second. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I think I still have that condition where it's It's like, you know, when there's no feeling, it feels weird. Like, I know that's doubt, that's confusion on some level. Maybe I shouldn't question it too much. Yeah, yeah, no, it's just questions. It's just this like confused feeling of like, oh, there's no feeling.

**Speaker B:** You know, well, remember that the feeling of sadness and the feeling of guilt both are connected with the feeling of fear. Yeah, like for instance, the sadness comes from the fear of loss. Oh, I've lost something. Yeah, or for many people, Lucky died, that means I'm going to die. Oh no, poor me, I'm going to die. Yeah, but in fact, it wasn't me that died, it was a dog that died. They don't live very long. They have to pack a whole lot of living in a much shorter period of time. Humans live 70, 80, 90 years. Dogs only live 10 to 20 years. In fact, Lucky was already 8 years old when she died, so she was already past her prime. Way past her prime. At 8 years, if the dog is a service dog, they'll put him in retirement at 8 years.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Um, she's like 60 years old already. She lived a good life. She had an easy life when she lived with me. I treated her very well. No reason for me to feel sad. If I want another dog, I'll go get another dog. In fact, Now we have cats. I'm just happy with the cats. No problem with having two cats. Yeah, two brothers. They're young now.

**Speaker A:** Um, it's also interesting to, you know, most likely, you know, in the case of animal poisoning, most likely they only suffer for a few minutes or hours maybe, and they're eventually just gone. Like, compared to 2 days. I see.

**Speaker B:** We caught her being sick, and she, uh, the last more than 24 hours, she could not get up. She was laying prone. But when I would come to see her, come to talk to her, She was always happy to see me, wag her head or wag her tail, move her head. But mostly she was really, really sick. We knew she was dying. We've seen dogs die from being poisoned here in Thailand before.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It's also, it's like basically comparing to the amount of joy that I had, the suffering is minuscule, right? It's basically seen from that angle.

**Speaker B:** If we have a choice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if we have the choice.

**Speaker B:** But we only have that choice if we can look and see.

**Speaker A:** Yes. That makes sense.

**Speaker B:** That's why it's important when you're thinking and you think about yourself, recognize that you're thinking about the dog, because then you have choice over how you're going to feel. If you start thinking about the dog but you're not aware of it, it's only subconscious thought. Naturally, the fear is going to arise in the form of sadness or guilt or both.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, makes sense.

**Speaker B:** You feel guilty because you're supposed to love her, you're supposed to miss her. You love her, that means you want her, that means you're not good enough without her. This is all very much a teaching that comes out of Christianity.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And by the way, funeral homes get rich off of this. This is why funeral homes make so much money. If people were much more alert and aware of it, like in Thailand, they have a funeral pyre. Yeah, and they just burned the body. But in America, they parade the body around in a, uh, in a hearse, buy an expensive coffin, get a vault, uh, often, uh, take the blood out of the body and put chemicals in, formaldehyde and whatnot. They called it embalming. Oh, that costs a lot of money. You have to pay a lot of money for grandpa's funeral to prove that you loved him. Yeah, so to kind of make sure that he put you in the will.

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, it's, uh, you know, very common here in Malaysia too, not just in Christianity, like, um Well, because the, the, the quote-unquote Buddhism here is still very affiliated with magical thinking and stuff. And yeah, I see funerals where they really drag it out for so long, it really makes you think, well, how much does it cost to just host one? It's crazy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, crazy thoughts about the future of heaven is part of that whole shtick. Yeah, you don't love Grandpa and you don't feel sad and you don't feel guilty, then God's not going to let you into heaven. Yeah, which means you got to go through hell now and then get redeemed instead of just— you're okay now. The dog died, I didn't die. Yeah, they made it very easy for me. I had a— I was okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Another dog, I'll get another dog. Yeah, and in fact, I never really thought that it was my dog. That's also a problem that people have— they own the dog. I remember years ago, people would ask, is that your dog? And I said, no, I'm that dog's human. The dog owns me, I don't own the dog. The dog on me, not the dog serving. I gotta pick up after him, I gotta train him, gotta feed him, gotta take the ticks off, gotta give him a bath. Who's the boss here? The dog doesn't give me a bath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— I think the whole reason I'm asking this was, well, it hasn't happened, but I think eventually, or whatever, it's just the same old story, Dhammarato. I'm pretty sure I'm not the first one who said this to you. It's just when it comes to relationship.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, that's right. That's why I'm saying it the way that I'm saying it. It is not just the dog, it's about any relationship. If you have a girlfriend, guess what? You don't own her, but she owns you in her mind. You got to take care of her. So when you lose the girl, think about it in the sense that, hey, you got along without her before you met her, you can get along without her now. Look how much work it took to take care of her. She wanted this and wants that, you got to go do this and you got to go do that, and when she's not there, you're free.

**Speaker A:** Actually, it's the opposite way. She doesn't want so much from me. I'm the one who wants so much from her. But well, it's the same thing either way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, now that's the best kind of relationship, is when you don't want so much from each other.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker B:** I think that's— even though that I'm sick and old, I make sure that I don't give work— Tam too much work to do. She has an easy life. That means that she's— the work that, that is required for her to take care of me is easy for her. I'm not dependent upon her.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I think that's something I'm trying to learn or understand. And I guess, yeah, you could almost say it's foreign to me, the understanding of a relationship where we don't, you know, like, don't need each other. Like, can you explain that for me? I guess I'm really stupid in this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, funny like that. You can have a friend, and if you don't need them, the friendship will last. If you start getting needy, if you need your friend, he's not going to be so easy to be friends with. He's going to go off someplace else. Doesn't matter if you need somebody, they start to resent it.

**Speaker A:** I agree. Yeah, I agree. I'm trying to— well, you know, it's basically, it's like, you know, my girlfriend is perfectly happy with me.

**Speaker B:** Like, she doesn't— Good catch, you're a Dhamma dude.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I guess this is where I need your, well, perspective or advice. I guess the problem is, is me. Like, I—.

**Speaker B:** Where else would you find the problem? And guess what? It's not a problem at all. It's just thoughts you have. Yeah, yeah, that problem— there's no problem in reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's just thoughts. Yeah, I have thoughts of— actually, I don't even know how to start. It's just a bunch of thoughts, you know, like thinking, oh, it's not enough, like, can you be a bit more of this and that? And it's not really a lot, but it starts feels like, well, basically I'm the dumb one. I'm the— yeah, just delusional. I don't know, it's— well, you know, to put it in another way, when my practice gets well, like when I'm happy, there's no problem in the relationship, you know, like it's That's kind of weird. I mean, not that it's weird, it's just, it's interesting how there's no problem when I'm happy.

**Speaker B:** It's not an established freedom. It's not an old established happiness. Therefore, it's still curious, weird, interesting, whatever like that, because you're acting in a new way. Yeah, acting in a new way and getting new and different results. So keep at it, keep remembering. When you do something, let it go.

**Speaker A:** You know, it's just— I know this Like maybe it's like my Piti story where I feel, not in a bad way, it's just kind of, maybe it is, I have no idea at this point. It's just this like feeling of wanting to cry, just realizing how stupid I am. But I guess that's another weird judgment I have. I mean, yeah, you're right. I've been seeing things in a lot of new ways sometimes. Like you said, I used the word scary because I realized how easy life actually is. But I guess right now I'm in a period of not easy phase again. But sorry.

**Speaker B:** It sounds like a relief. What a relief it is. Life is easy now. It's really easy. I can be okay when the dog dies. I'm not obligated to feel guilty. I'm not obligated to feel sad. Oh, I missed her. 'Oh, I loved her. Now she's gone. Oh, poor me.' That's what normal people do. But if you've got the Dharma, you can come out with, 'Goodbye, glad you're here, but it's time for you to go. It's time because I can't stop you. You're dead now.'.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Um, yesterday I talked to Dhamma Das. Uh, well, I'm not sure how this is relevant. I think it's relevant. Um, Because of the thing I've been experiencing lately here, yesterday there was a very huge accident, car accident, like it's so huge where 5 people died instantly. I guess I was a bit of shock because it's happening near me. When I was talking to Dhammarato, I mentioned that, and then he said something which I'm not even sure if he realized what he said, but was kind of wise, where he's like, funnily enough, those people that die, maybe they only suffer for like a few minutes and they are gone. And the the real people that are suffering is the people that keep talking about the news and keep lamenting on it and keep being in that. That's right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have heard maybe before that the hero dies only once, but the coward dies a thousand deaths.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, now that's actually true. And we can see how true it is when, uh, we change the language a little bit from the happy Dharma dude only dies one time and that's the actual death, to where everyone else who is in fear, every time they become afraid that they're close, if they think they're going to die, they're— I mean, they experience death without actually dying.

**Speaker A:** It's like the play of— And then after we eat it. Yeah. It's like the previewing. It's like previewing. It's kind of funny. I mean, I'm kind of doing that, I guess, subconsciously.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what happens with most people though is they have all the bad feelings about death, without actually getting the death. They rob themselves and have to, uh, in the sense of paying for it with all the bad feelings, and yet they never get the delivery.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** But the Dharma dude, he doesn't have to ever pay for it until it actually happens. And then if he's got a wise mind, the death happens without any, uh, ill will or bad feelings or whatever. Yeah, as the Christians sometimes say, death has no sting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Um, you know, this, this talk was so helpful because it just reminds me how all this Dukkha, this thing, is fabricated by myself. I kind of want to ask you about Sangha. Like, I mean, I was talking to Samatha like a few weeks ago. I was kind of bringing up this topic of sometimes I kind of get sick and tired of the online Dharma community, like, you know, they could be saying some weird stuff and I get annoyed and judgy, I guess. But then he said, you know, the one that's Dukkha is me because I'm the one who's thinking how that should be or shouldn't be. And I agree with him totally. I guess my question.

**Speaker B:** Is crazy stuff, let them be the one who is crazy saying crazy stuff. You don't have to go crazy when you read it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I agree. It's just my old habits.

**Speaker B:** I'm responsible for them. Yeah, you're just now learning how to be responsible for yourself.

**Speaker A:** Totally. Yeah, the mind gets really free, you know, when just realized, oh, I just have to be responsible for myself. Yeah, but basically my question was like, my question was, because of that I realized how easily my mind can be disturbed. I kind of disengage from the place. I think that kind of makes sense. I feel like— I mean, the Buddha talked a lot about sense restraint, right? Like, basically just don't look. I guess that's what you call wise ignorance, Dhammarato, very often.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I didn't hear you. You said what?

**Speaker A:** Oh, sorry. Uh, I guess that's what you said, wise ignorance.

**Speaker B:** Like, why? That's right. If you don't know, know that you don't know and that you're okay that you don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because foolish ignorance is I don't know, therefore I need to know, therefore I'm going to make something up, I'm going to have a belief. You'd be surprised in America how often they use the word belief.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I guess I'm very conditioned by the Western mindset because of the thing I consume. Sometimes I keep reading about— actually, no, maybe— I mean, I read a lot about the Thai community where people in Thailand, because of the Buddhist— I think the Buddhism is very prevalent there, that But when they encounter huge suffering or loss, they kind of get over it quite easily compared to other counterparts of the countries. But it's a very easy acceptance of things.

**Speaker B:** I've seen that. I can see that that's part of the Thai culture. They don't cling very long. They get over things. Yeah, pretty healthy culture. As cultures go, it's pretty healthy. As nobility goes, it's still pretty sick. There's still some bad elements. In fact, when I first came to Thailand, I was in basically one wat after another. Mostly I arrived at Wat Suwan Mok. And I got a very strange view of Thai people about how marvelous and wonderful they were and how close to the Dhamma that they were. But the only people that I saw were those in the wat. When I got out in the Thai community, I was shocked. Anagami, yeah, that was the people at the water generally in their best behavior.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I kind of want to— I've been saying that for a long time. Yeah, yeah, that's actually what 30 minutes drive away. I keep making excuses, like I should pay them a visit. Maybe there's something, I don't know. I find a lot of benefit when, as you said, Dhammarato, like noble friendship. When I talk to people like Dhamma Das, you, Mikey, it's just this very refreshing thing. Like, I'm just— even Alexander, I feel like him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually we got quite a few good dudes. We've got Brett, we've got Martin, and we've got Michael, and we've got Alex, and as you said, Mikey. We've got Scott. We've got a huge, huge number of people. Anna.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I never talked to her.

**Speaker B:** No number of people who really understand the Dharma quite well. Yeah, Jesus is another. Yeah, well, you've got good people to associate with. So when you find those that are online that are crying in their beer or complaining something, recognize, well, they're new at it. They just haven't gotten the Dhamma yet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I think I'm sometimes— I'm not saying all the time, but sometimes I'm still very easily influenced. And I'm basically that person where you say, you know, like, like there's two monks going across the river And then he picked up the lady and then the other junior monk is like, keep thinking about it and bring it out. And then he said, you know, I put down the ladies hours ago, and you're still carrying her around. I'm basically that, I'm still very kind of easily influenced sometimes.

**Speaker B:** That's the thing that I had lucky But when she crossed the river, it was time to set her down. Why should I carry a dead dog around?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** So why are— when you read something, why do you let it influence you? You've read it, it's crossed this river, set it down.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But we have to remember to do that. You have to remember to set that stuff down. It gets heavy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like holding a cup, right? I think you mentioned it before, like, you know, you hold it for a minute, it's okay. 30 minutes later, it's gonna get sore. And that's basically what I'm doing. Yeah, yeah, dropping it right now. Just, I keep gonna remind myself over and over to drop it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, set it down, drop it, untie yourself.

**Speaker A:** No feelings.

**Speaker B:** Okay, don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go practice this. Um, yeah, it's really that simple. Thank you. Thank you for the reminder. I don't know why my mind gets— try to complicate stuff, you know. It's really that simple. It's really that simple.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, you seem that you've gotten your joy juice back. You've got your mojo. Did you recognize that you don't have to carry dead dogs around? Or bad comments or old ladies or anything. You don't have to do that. You can just set it down. Everything is already okay. Yeah, yeah, problems too. You don't have any problems. You're a lucky dude. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, I guess I I feel way better because I talked to Dharma Das yesterday. He really helped me out. Um, and yeah, I'm gonna practice more.

**Speaker B:** All right, why don't we finish this call and you go and practice? You remember to look at what you're thinking and make a change.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I will. Yeah, maybe, maybe just a quick question, Dhammarato, about the— I always curious about what you say, you can choose how you feel. But isn't that on some level I'm getting rid of the feeling? I thought that we always, we only have to get rid of the thoughts, like how we— the negative, unwholesome thought, that's the only thing I have to get rid of.

**Speaker B:** Talk about the Satipatthana, to make the body comfortable and relaxed and to be able to control our feelings so that we feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. Feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied is not the same kind of feeling as wanting and desiring or trying to get rid of. Satisfied. That's a joyful kind of feeling. No fear. Yeah, we have to not change our thought, but we also have to change our attitude from being a victim of my thoughts into being the winner, that you're in control of your thoughts. So we've got all four parts of the Satipatthana. We change our thoughts, we change our attitude, we change our feelings, and we change the body. From being uptight into being comfortable and relaxed. That's why Anapanasati Sutta is framed on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. So remember, you've got four jobs to do. And the place that we begin is we begin with changing the thought. Changing the thoughts will change our attitude. Changing our thoughts will change the feelings. Changing our thoughts and attitudes will change our feelings. Remember to take a deep breath and let the body help change your attitude and change your feelings by relaxing, because fear, in fact, is always in the body. It's a chemical situation. You have to relax the body to get rid of the adrenaline, to get rid of the cortisol, to feel comfortable and safe, even energetic.

**Speaker A:** Even energetic. Okay. Yes, too much energy, too much energy can be bad, right? Like too much energy, like restlessness. It's bad.

**Speaker B:** So even though I harp on the thoughts, it's not just the thoughts. We've got to change our attitude, got to change our feelings.

**Speaker A:** Makes sense, because all these are the same. It's interrelated to each other. Like, it doesn't exist by itself, right?

**Speaker B:** They affect, they influence each other. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm— yeah, okay, I'm gonna go practice this again, same thing as always.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato. See you, have a good one.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), centers on **how to skillfully relate to feelings, thoughts, and loss to end suffering (dukkha)**. Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Teaching: Wisdom at the Point of Contact**
The discussion begins with clarifying the practice of being aware of feelings—specifically knowing when you are **liking** or **disliking** something. Dhammarato emphasizes that this awareness gives you a **choice**. Recognizing a feeling as it arises is "wisdom at the point of contact," allowing you to change your response rather than being controlled by habitual reactions.

### **Practical Application: Dealing with Loss**
The main example is processing the death of Dhammarato's dog, Lucky. He illustrates how to avoid unnecessary suffering:
*   **You have a choice in how you feel:** You are not obligated to feel sad, guilty, or to cling to loss. Instead, you can choose to feel gratitude ("I'm glad you were in my life") and then let go ("goodbye").
*   **Suffering is created by uncontrolled thought:** The real suffering isn't in the event itself, but in the subsequent, uncontrolled thinking about it (lamenting, fearing your own death, feeling guilty). He contrasts this with the Thai cultural tendency toward quicker acceptance.
*   **The analogy of carrying the burden:** Like the classic story of the monk carrying a woman across a river, we must learn to "set down" thoughts and stories after the event has passed. Carrying them ("a dead dog") is an optional, self-inflicted burden.

### **Expanding the Principle to All Relationships**
The teaching extends beyond death to all attachments (e.g., romantic relationships, online interactions):
*   **Neediness creates suffering:** Healthy relationships are based on non-neediness. If you are needy or dependent, it breeds resentment and instability. Happiness within yourself makes relationships problem-free.
*   **You are responsible for your own mind:** When disturbed by others (e.g., annoying online comments), the problem is not their actions but your thoughts about how things "should be." The solution is to "set it down" and not let it influence you.
*   **Sense Restraint & Wise Ignorance:** It is wise to disengage from sources that habitually disturb your mind. This is not suppression but skillful protection—knowing what you don't need to know and being okay with that.

### **The Holistic Path: The Four Foundations of Mindfulness**
In the final part, Dhammarato clarifies that the practice isn't just about changing thoughts. It involves all four aspects of Satipatthana (Foundations of Mindfulness), which are interconnected:
1.  **Body:** Relax the body to release the physical chemicals of fear (adrenaline, cortisol).
2.  **Feelings:** Cultivate feelings of safety, comfort, and satisfaction—not desire or aversion.
3.  **Mind (Thoughts):** Change unwholesome thoughts; be the "winner" in control of your mind, not its victim.
4.  **Mind Objects (Attitude):** Shift your overall attitude from one of lack and fear to one of okayness and freedom.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Freedom is a choice:** You can choose your emotional response by being aware at the moment of contact.
*   **Let go of mental burdens:** Don't carry past events or others' opinions. See them, acknowledge them, and set them down.
*   **The problem is always in your thoughts:** External events are not the problem; your unchecked narrative about them is.
*   **Practice holistic mindfulness:** Work with the body, feelings, thoughts, and attitude together to cultivate a steady, happy mind independent of conditions.

The talk concludes with the reminder that **"everything is already okay"** and the practice is to remember this simplicity, drop complicating thoughts, and return to a relaxed, joyful state.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Dead Dog" / "Carrying the Dead Dog" Metaphor**
This is the central metaphor of the talk. Speaker B uses the story of his dog Lucky dying to illustrate how we unnecessarily carry emotional burdens.
*   **The Story:** His dog was poisoned and died. He explains he could choose to feel sad, guilty, and dwell on the loss, or he could appreciate the time they had and say "goodbye."
*   **The Metaphor:** Carrying the memory/thought of the dead dog represents clinging to past suffering, loss, or unwholesome thoughts. The wise action is to "set it down" or "put it down" after it has "crossed the river" (i.e., after the event has passed). He explicitly connects this to the classic Buddhist story of the monk carrying the woman across the river.

**2. The "Carrying the Woman Across the River" Story**
Speaker A references this classic Buddhist parable to describe his own tendency to hold onto things.
*   **The Story:** Two monks encounter a woman who needs help crossing a river. The senior monk carries her across. Hours later, the junior monk is still agitated, saying, "We monks aren't supposed to touch women!" The senior monk replies, "I set her down hours ago. Why are you still carrying her?"
*   **Its Use:** Speaker A admits he is like the junior monk, easily influenced and carrying mental burdens long after the event. Speaker B reinforces this by linking it directly to "carrying a dead dog around."

**3. The "Holding a Cup" Metaphor**
This is a brief but potent metaphor for carrying mental burdens.
*   **The Metaphor:** Holding a cup for a minute is fine, but holding it for 30 minutes makes your arm sore.
*   **Its Use:** It illustrates how thoughts or feelings only become suffering (**dukkha**) through prolonged clinging and identification. The solution is to "drop it."

**4. The "Funeral Home / Embalming" Anecdote**
This is used as a cultural story to illustrate fabricated suffering.
*   **The Story:** Speaker B contrasts simple Thai funeral pyres with elaborate, expensive Western funerals involving embalming, expensive caskets, and vaults.
*   **Its Use:** It serves as a metaphor for how societal and religious expectations (like "you must prove your love through grief and expense") create unnecessary, complex suffering around death. It's presented as a "shtick" or a racket that preys on confused feeling.

**5. The "Hero and the Coward" Metaphor**
This is an adaptation of a well-known saying.
*   **The Metaphor:** "The hero dies only once, but the coward dies a thousand deaths."
*   **Its Use:** Speaker B reframes it in Dhamma terms: The wise person ("Dharma dude") only experiences the actual physical event of death once, without prefabricated fear. The person living in fear "dies" emotionally countless times through anticipation, worry, and dread, "paying for it with all the bad feelings" without "getting the delivery."

**6. The "Owner vs. Owned" Metaphor in Relationships**
This is a recurring theme used to reframe attachment.
*   **The Metaphor:** Speaker B flips the common notion of pet ownership: "The dog owns me, I don't own the dog." He extends this to human relationships (girlfriends, friends).
*   **Its Use:** It challenges the sense of possession and dependency that leads to suffering. A healthy relationship is one where you "don't need each other" in a needy, dependent way, thus avoiding resentment and fear of loss.

**7. The "Previewing" / "Paying Without Delivery" Metaphor**
This is a vivid commercial metaphor for anxiety.
*   **The Metaphor:** Suffering from fear of a future event (like death) is like "previewing" it or "paying for it" (in emotional currency) without ever "getting the delivery" (the actual event).
*   **Its Use:** It highlights the irrationality of suffering in anticipation, which is a core form of fabricated **dukkha**.

**Summary:** The talk uses **concrete, everyday stories** (a dead dog, a funeral, a cup) and **adapted classic tales** to illustrate the abstract Dhamma principles of non-clinging, the fabricated nature of suffering, and the power of mindful choice in response to feelings. The metaphors consistently point toward the possibility of "setting down" burdens through awareness.
