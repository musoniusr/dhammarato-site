### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There he goes.

**Speaker B:** Scott, it's really good to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you.

**Speaker B:** You had a question about the 5 pictures that you put on the Skype. Where middle one is where everybody normally thinks of what enlightenment— make me everything. But that is actually a perception. I am one with everything— that's a thought, right? Actually being one with everything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, um, This teaching of Paticcasamuppada is deeply, deeply related to the Jhanas in the sense that in order to experience these items on Paticcasamuppada, the mind must be in a state or condition that it can see that stuff directly, rather than having it as a list of items that you would put down as an answer to some test. Yeah, that's what's happened with much of Buddhist teaching. It as a subject of information, and we treat it like any other school topic, and we turn it into a conceptualization. So we perceive and conceptualize Piti, Samuppada, and then we also receive and conceptualize the jhanas. Where the reality is, is that the state of the jhana is when one is in that state, then that means that they're a particular place in the Paticcasamuppada. And so the first jhana would be the point where we are being able to actually control to control the feelings, because we have Sukkha and Piti in the first Jhana, so we've already learned to control the feelings, and this is what we mean by wisdom at the contact. But the reality is that we've already started making some changes to the salyatana, that we're already beginning to perceive things differently, because the salyatana has that gladdening of the mind, the language that we use to brighten things up. And as we then progress through the Jhanas, we get more and more intense at that point of feeling for the second Jhana and then the third Jhana. When the fourth Jhana comes, we start then looking at the deeper things that are there in the sense of the relationship between our actual sensory input and what we do with it. So the first 3 jhanas have to do with what we do with it, and then the 4th jhana has various aspects that help us figure out how to stop doing what we are doing. Now in the beginning, the ordinary person, the things that we are doing wind us up ignorantly in Tanha, Upadana, Bhavana, Jati, and Dukkha. So those things happen when we are in the ordinary state. But when we're in the first Jhana, that means that we can guard enough of that sensory, let us say sensory output. Talking about sensory input, the sensory output is actually the salyattana, or the sense that we make out of things. Now this is actually quite confusing for a lot of students, and so let's get that a little bit cleared up, and I'll use the word seeing, like I see with the eyes, which means that colors, shapes, forms, and movements come in through the eyes. But then I can say something like, I see a tree, or even more specifically, I see what you mean. "now I see what you mean" means that now, hopefully, our conceptualized language is in sync, because I actually see, or I perceive, or I have the same concept that you do. So, "I see what you mean," we're engaged or in line with each other, and that's at the point of sallyatani. So actually we have two different kinds of consciousness. We have the raw input consciousness and then the processed consciousness. The processed consciousness then, think about it like a hard drive that has been partitioned, so you know the size of it. There's two different states that a partition can be in: one is raw, and the other one is formatted. And if it is formatted, that means that now we can use it to store data. Okay, so what we're actually doing here with this concept, this concept language, is to remove the formatting and leave the drive raw. It's empty. Which means that we don't hang on or store or cling to any of the sensory input, we just allow it to come. Now, in continuing with the data processing concept, that if you've got a program that is processing the data— now, in the old, old equipment before computers came along, they had things called unit record equipment that did all the accounting work. The unit record equipment, a unit record, by the way, is a punched card, a Hollerith punched card. Perhaps you've seen them. They're in the archives sometimes. In fact, the Hollerith punch card was the actual size of the greenback dollar of the 1890s. The dollars that we have now are a little bit smaller. But the greenback dollar was the format for the Hollerith card. The point that I'm making is, is that the data is punched as punched holes in the card. When the card goes into the machine, as it's being inputted, various— because of the cycling, that when the card has a hole in it, there's a contact made. That contact may be hardwired through a punch board that looks very similar to the old— you've seen telephone systems where the operator is saying, may I have your number please? And then she'll take a cord and she'll plug it into various places to make the contacts. Okay, so we have that with the punch cards so that when that punch card hole has a contact, that can either go to an adder or it can go to a printer printhead. But the timing of it has to do then with when that bale is set up and stopped, so that at the end of the cycle all of the bales are in the row, and then the hammers come and go a big whack, and that'll print a line. Okay, so the point that I'm making is that those kind of machines did very, very little processing. So the speed of the input card is the processing speed. The machine has to be that way so that by the time the card is read, it's either calculated or printed. Right? If it's a calculation, then it has to run through another print cycle to get the bail set up for the numbers. That's why it will sound like a ka-chong, because the first ka is the setting up of the alphabet, and then the chong is when the numbers are set up. OK, very little processing. Now in modern computers, we have it set up so that a piece of information is either taken off of a CD or off of a flash drive or off of a hard drive or off the internet, and then that data has to be processed, has to be calculated up, and then later it's got to be set up for a printer because modern printers don't have that very simplicity. Now they have to calculate which dot is going to be printed and all of that kind of stuff. And so, what that means is, is that the ability for the computer to read data at full speed is hindered by the processing of the data. So, you read and you process, you read and you process, you read and you process. This is the way that the human mind is going. So, what we're now learning to do is do more reading and less processing. And as we are doing more reading and less processing, that means that the amount of information that can come in becomes huge. That while we're looking for understanding, we'll pinpoint something, we'll listen to it. We talked about the sound a moment ago. If I have the sound and identify that as the oboe, while I'm doing that, I'm going to be missing everything else the orchestra is doing right then in that second. Because now I've got Ogo on my mind rather than the sound of the.

**Speaker A:** Orchestra on my mind. Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is the whole idea of it then, is that we can either gain data and then process it, we can either process it wisely or process it ignorantly. But what we're learning to do is to see that processing and then beginning to bring it to a halt, so that we allow just raw data input. So that means that we have very, very little sallyakhtana and a whole lot of Vinaya, which is actually— these are the two kinds of consciousness. Philosophers and psychologists, they look at consciousness as that which we perceive. The Buddha is saying no, consciousness is the ability to take in input, not the ability to process it for understanding. But there's that stages in there from the input through the processing. Now the processing requires old data. That's where the salyattana comes in for ordinary people.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead. Can you clarify? So the Buddha defines consciousness as the processing or the input?

**Speaker B:** The input itself. The ability itself. That's why they call it eye consciousness, because it's the data that comes into the eye, or ear consciousness or sound consciousness, because of the data that comes into the ear. Or the touch consciousness because of the data that comes into and contacts the body.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. So that is the real consciousness that the Buddha talks about. And then after it's processed, that's the kind of consciousness that we say, oh, I see what you mean. That is the kind of consciousness, but it is manufactured inside the human existence to where real consciousness is the consciousness that comes in through the sensory system, right?

**Speaker A:** Because I was kind of confused about consciousness because I came from Advaita and Advaita tradition, or like I mainly studied that or practiced like non-dual Hindu type of traditions where consciousness is the awareness of the input. So that's the way it's seen is that it's the receiver of input. Is that's consciousness and it's some kind of permanent ground. So there's kind of like a self-identification with that, but that's all the way down the road as we're talking about of the dependent origination. That now that the self is constructed, it identifies as something, some kind of awareness.

**Speaker B:** All right, let's use this example. The example is that an apple tree is ripe with apples, and apples are falling. So that's the conceptualized setup. As the observer sees the object falling, that's all there is. But what humans do with that, and they will say, "Oh, that is an apple that fell." and I want that apple. So we actually go and pick up that apple and put it into our basket and claim it to be mine. Okay, that's the whole process of Paticcasamuppada right there. This is my apple, right? That's where the selfishness comes in, and it came in because we wanted the apple, because we liked the apple, because we recognized that it was an apple that fell. So if we back up to the point of just seeing it— and I use the word 'it' now because it's unidentified yet— when we see just falling, we see it fall, and that's all there is to it. That means then that we can continue to look and see other fruit trees with other apples falling, and we can see 'I saw that' also, I saw falling, I saw falling, I saw falling, I saw falling, and that's all that there is. Except that the 'I saw falling,' we could better just say, 'Seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing,' and that's all there is. If we say 'falling,' then that's actually a kind of perception. And then apple falling is more perception, more Salyatana. And that when the apple— and we recognize that it's an apple that fell, that's what contacts us, not just seeing. So we now say, I see an apple falling, and that is what contacts us. And so that's where the feeling comes from. I like apples. I want that apple that fell. Okay, so this is now the progression of Paticcasamuppada. But if we can leave it at just seeing, just seeing, then that means that we brought an end to perception and feelings. There's nothing to feel because we're not perceiving anything, we're not being contacted in any way, we're just seeing. So at that level, that would be that first, fifth one. Okay, so that middle one of make me one with everything means that I perceive everything including me, and I am a part of everything. That still has that self in it, perception. But it's a major, major step forward.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because that first picture is where most people are. That first picture is where we, uh, in the picture, the guy, uh, standing there sees the bird, but now he's got to process it as bird. He's got to process it as sound. I hear the bird. Saying, and that's why there is separation. I am here and the bird is there. But if we just hear a sound without even identifying it as a bird, because if we identify it as a bird, then we might want the bird. If we just hear it as a sound, then that's leaving it at that level of Sanya— excuse me, of Vinaya. And not going to the sallyakhtana, not going as far as I know what that is. Now this is an important thing about the idea that we can in fact receive so much more input if we're not processing the input that we do receive.

**Speaker A:** Now it's strange.

**Speaker B:** This is where we get the idea of a flood. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** It's, I know the experience you're talking about. And it's such a weird, like, subtlety that how could you possibly intend to experience like that? Because already you've processed it, if you're trying to experience it. So it's a weird thing, like it's so weird, but you can't, but somehow it happens. But it's like, it's hard to make sense of it because it's hard to practice it, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Actually, another way of saying it is that it requires a skill, and that skill is what we're developing. And we're developing several skills that help us to do that. And without skills, just like sawing wood, you've got a piece of wood and you've got a saw and you may be able to saw that piece of wood, but you can't make furniture out of that because you don't have the skills of measuring, you don't have the skills of seeing any of the stuff about what's going on. And so this is what we need to build the skills. And the important way to look at this is that most of the skills that we need to be able to do this are the skills of First Jhana. The skills that we need are built in First Jhana, and that the important skill is not that we can momentarily pay attention to the sensory input. It's that can we persist with that a while? So the ability to sustain the fourth jhana is the same skill that we're developing of being able to sustain wholesome thoughts at the first jhana. If we can think and have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought, then we can begin to put some gaps in there. But when we do put that there, there's still a whole lot of feeling left.

**Speaker A:** Is there, um, is, is the first 4 jhanas, uh, sufficient, or do you need, or should, is it better to like develop the skill of going past the fourth jhana to the formless jhanas. You don't need to do that.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Now you're getting way off of stuff. I'm not— in fact, we could call that part of it the Hinduism that was added to Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so you don't teach those at all?

**Speaker B:** No, no. What we talk instead is, is that there are really only four jhanas, and the question is if you can get into the Jhana and sustain it, what are you going to do with it?

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, in some suttas, if you, um, um, uh, list it that way, then you could say that there are 9 Jhanas. Okay, okay. You probably heard these things before. One would be infinite Oh gosh, I've got to have that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, infinite consciousness.

**Speaker B:** Infinite space. And right, guess what? Let's start it first at that point. In the time of the Buddha, there was no concept of infinite. It did not exist. That infinite, in fact, is a mathematical concept. And the reality is, is things just keep going on and on and on, and there's no end to it. Infinite is a concept that does not really exist. There is nothing in the universe aside from mathematics, there is nothing in the universe that is actually infinite. Everything is finite. The amount of energy in the universe is finite, the age of the universe is finite, the number of stars in the universe is finite, the size of the universe is finite. The number of grains of sand on the beach is vast and uncountable, but not infinite. If the grains of sand upon the beaches were infinite, then not only would the Earth— and there would be no room for water because it would be all sand. There would be no room for the space between Jupiter and Mars because it would be all sand. The whole universe would be nothing but sand, and even the universe itself is not big enough to have all the sand. That would be an infinite amount of sand. It's a concept that does not exist in reality. Now, Bhikkhu Bodhi should have understood that much about mathematics when he chose the word 'infinite,' because the real word that we're looking for is the word boundless.

**Speaker A:** Boundless, yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because this is really what's going on when we talk about infinite space. What we're talking about really is, where is the boundary between your skin and the air? Is there actually a boundary there? The answer is, upon close inspection, there is no boundary. Not a hard fixed boundary. Ordinary people think there are, but then what about the hair on your arm? Does the hair on your arm go into the air? Does the hair on your arm go into your arm? Then where's the end of you, and where's the end of the hair, and where does the air begin? The answer to that is some of that air is already inside the skin anyway. There is no real cut hard boundary there, no boundaries, that we are a part of it. That in fact, when you're breathing, where is the boundary between the air and the body? Because the body is being— is breathing in and out, is part of the air. And so this idea of infinite space means the space that we're in has no real boundaries to it. Now, the boundaries of consciousness, though, is the boundary between the actual sensory input and your perceiving. We stopped the boundary, we put a boundary in there because we stopped taking data long enough to try to figure out what it was that we saw. And so one of the— we've covered two of them now. One is infinite space and infinite consciousness, which is basically just bound— the boundaries don't exist. There really are no boundaries. When we come to understand there are no boundaries, that's when the Dalai Lama becomes one with everything because he's removed the boundaries. That is an element of the fourth Jhana. And we could sit and muse and see that temporarily, momentarily, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so these are like elements of the fourth jhana.

**Speaker B:** These are aspects.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, that makes more sense to me. So because like I've experienced— because like I was expecting it to be like another fourth jhana, just how like First Jhana is like First Jhana, and Second Jhana is like Second Jhana, and then Third Jhana is like Third Jhana, Fourth Jhana is like Fourth Jhana. But then these other, like, boundlessness and stuff, it's kind of just like a temporary little— it's like a thing, but like it comes out of the equanimity, or the total equanimity, right?

**Speaker B:** When the mind is stopped and stable, then we can hear those things. Like the sound, we can hear the sound of the whole orchestra. We could not possibly reproduce it in our head, but we can hear it all. Okay, but if we start labeling it, oh, that's an oboe, and that's a French horn, and that's a violin, we are now really limiting The sensory input. When we hear the violin and identify it as a violin, we're not listening to the bass. That's the whole point, is that we have selective perception. And by selecting out the input that we're using, that limits us because of our selection process.

**Speaker A:** And something you said, going back to Paticcasamuppada, something you said in last night's Sangha Mage. So if you can catch things at the point of liking them, so before it becomes craving, just, I like this, why do I like this? You can kind of stop it in its tracks, right? You can stop it Like, because the—.

**Speaker B:** Exactly so, because when you're asking that question, why do I like it, you're actually now doing a bit of investigation of your perceptual system, right?

**Speaker A:** Your perceptual system.

**Speaker B:** And the perceptual system has that past in it. I like it because I am used to that, it's familiar to me. That we like things because they are familiar to us.

**Speaker A:** But that's like a conceptual frame of it. But I'm talking about seeing like the experience of liking something, like seeing the mechanism of I like this and like seeing it and they're like, what is that? Rather than going into the past of like, why do I like this? Just like seeing the mechanism of liking something and like catching it there. And then you could see that it's another, it's just a sensation. That's like not, it's like, it's another input. Like even the liking something is like a information before you process it into more stuff.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. Exactly. The sequence of events that are listed in the 12 steps of dependent origination, it seems very complicated to people until they've realized really what's going on. And when they do that, they'll say, wait a minute, the water of Paticcasamuppada does not flow completely straight down, that there are eddies and circles and things in there that make things kind of move around. That yes, once you see that you like it, that's a new consciousness that brings up a new perception. But if we don't do that, then if we just like it ignorantly and are not doing that extra processing, not forming that eddy to see what's going on, then that feeling of liking will go immediately into Anagami. And so going back to that point about the various parts of it now is that we've looked at two of them. Another one to look at is the one that's called neither perception nor non-perception. This is actually beginning to understand the boundary between perception and consciousness. In other words, you have to have a little bit of perception to perceive consciousness itself. You can't have zero, because if there is zero perception, then we're not actually receiving the data as strict input. So there's a very tiny, tiny little bit of perception in there, and in the Visuddhimagga they give the example of that. As a clay bowl, like an oil lamp, but a clay bowl that has had oil in it, and you've drained all the oil out. Even though there is no oil that you can, let us say, remove, you can actually take a cloth and work around the bowl and get that cloth oily a little bit. You could do that over and over again, and pretty soon there's very little or no oil coming off of the inside of the bowl as oil onto the cloth, but you still know that there is oil in the bowl. The oil is there inside the bowl, inside mixed with the clay itself. There is no way to get all of the oil back out of the bowl. Some of the oil stays in the bowl. So in that regard, that means that we need just a tiny little bit of perception in order to be able to receive data consciously. This is the state of neither perception nor non-perception, but they can go a little bit further, in the sense of when there is no perception at all, then the consciousness and the sensory input doesn't happen very well at all, and this is what we mean by the state of nothingness. There is nothing there, because the consciousness is not having enough perception to even be able to perceive the consciousness. So these are some of the items on that list of infinite space, infinite consciousness, when we know that it's not infinite, it's just the boundaries are getting loose. So the boundary between consciousness and perception is a very, very interesting place. This one, when the mind is really, really sharp, you can begin to see that there is that boundary between the perception, and we're going to begin to remove that boundary so that we can just see the sensory input. When we can bring the perception to an end, that means that there is no salyatana to impact us, to give feeling. This is then the state of.

**Speaker A:** Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Equanimity, or Upekkha is the state of nothingness, because there's no feelings left. There's no feelings left because there is no perception left, and all there is is just raw input of data, just raw input. So we're not taking what that input is, the reality, the rupa, into naming it, or bringing it to a state of understanding. We're doing less and less of that, and when there is no perception left, there is no naming left, then there is no contact left. And when there is no contact left, there is nothing to rise feelings, and so the feelings go into a state of Anicca, not really there. And in the Sutra No. 111, in the one by one as they occur, this is where Buddha and Sariputra recognize that's the end of the practice. There's nothing left to the business of the Dharma or anything else when we can bring our feelings to a stop. And we bring the feelings to a stop by bringing perception to a stop. That there's nothing left. There's nothing.

**Speaker A:** That's it.

**Speaker B:** That's it. That's as far as we could go.

**Speaker A:** It's kind of cool.

**Speaker B:** But it's still temporary. No one stays in that state.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely temporary.

**Speaker B:** No one stays in that state. Everything is then temporary. But when you come back out, you come back with a kind of— with the sense of relief. Wow, that's just all there is to it. Yeah, but that sense of relief is only happening when it starts back up, because you have now seen it right to the very end. The only thing that's even more peaceful than that is death itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just dying. It'll happen eventually.

**Speaker B:** So this is what they are talking about. And that picture that you had, those 5 things actually are— it looks very, very Zen, the way that it's done with the Zen drawing and all of that kind of stuff. And many of the Theravadas will say, well, wait a minute, Zen is missing so much of the data. It's missing— I mean, they didn't even have the Suttas. But this picture shows, yes, they do understand. These pictures are actually a pictorial representation of the fourth jhana.

**Speaker A:** I don't think those pictures come from a Zen person. It's not from Zen. I think it, like, stylistically might look like that, but it's— oh, I think that's— yeah, it's, uh, it's about— I think it's about this It's more Theravada, if anything. Um, I don't know, those pictures, they.

**Speaker B:** Actually knew what they were doing though. Yeah, that's right. I have not seen those pictures before, but when I did, I say that's, that's it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, someone picture, of course, a thousand words. Here I spent 37 minutes or 40 minutes talking about it with all of these words, and those 5 photos, it's a good picture.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I got it from another pretty popular Dharma practitioner who, he was influenced by Daniel Ingram, and then he went through all the path attainments, and he He makes a lot of videos and like has a lot of good stuff out there, and he like shared that. So it was a pretty good find indeed.

**Speaker B:** Well, the Western mentality is that this stuff is really, really hard to do. But the reality is, is that no, it's just a matter of skills. And very few people develop the skill that they need to do. But these skills are available to anyone. If they practice these skills, they would be able to take the mind into these states.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** But then it's all temporary. But the one that we want to really practice and stay with and put a lot of time in not just putting a lot of time in practicing trying to do it, but spending a lot of time in first jhana to be able to apply the mind, sustain the mind, and apply the mind and sustain the mind in the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Because that's what calms you down, starts to calm you down enough to see.

**Speaker B:** To see clearly, to see better. And as we do that, and as we get more and more calm, we begin to calm the mind down to where the actual thoughts stop. But we talk about— there's a problem with the word thought. This is why I tend to go into the idea of a mind moment. How do you spend the mind moment? Because a mind moment can be spent in discursive thought. It can be spent as an argument. It can also be spent as observation. And when we are spending our time in observation only, that's the fourth jhana. And everybody moves in and out of this, just like anyone— the first jhana would be described as being able to read. Most people say they can read, and when they find something interesting to read, they'll start reading, but after the first paragraph or so, they're spending more time thinking about what they just read than the further reading. And so now the eyes are following along with the words, but we're not picking up that data. We're remembering and talking to ourselves about what used to be there. And so the first jhana is being able to read and read and read, and at the end of the sentence, you know that you got that sentence. At the end of the paragraph, you know you got that paragraph. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is why the listening to you and like the way you talk about it, before then the Jhana was like some kind of mystical like experience, like idea of a mystical experience. And yeah, it's like that's probably how most people see it. It's like some sort of mystical.

**Speaker B:** But they're not even taking that mystical experience apart. It's almost when we say mystical experience, that means that we cannot dissect to that either. Okay, that is, that this is where religion comes in. That is indescribable because we haven't done the evaluation yet.

**Speaker A:** You just get— you just say, oh.

**Speaker B:** It'S God, it's good, it's a miracle, or, or is this or something like that. And, and that's what makes it magical for most people. Other than a level of skill. The same exact same thing is done with prestidigitation or magic tricks, that you have to be able to practice what you're doing over and over again so that you can get your hands just right. So that, for instance, the example would be of doing something with bottle caps. And you have to kind of convince the person that's with you that you've only got one bottle cap, because you're holding the other bottle cap in your hand like this with your finger. And so you can put that one bottle cap on the top of the hand, and then turn the hand over, and that bottle cap lands on the tip of the finger, because it was actually glued to the one that was inside. And you bring that up while you catch the one in the air in your hand here, And they think that the bottle cap was able to magically land on the tip of your finger, when in fact it was glued. It was already glued there. We begin to realize then that everything is real, that just because we didn't see what happened didn't mean that it was magical.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay.

**Speaker B:** Seeing through prestidigitation is in fact one of the remarkable awakenings that we have. And then we can recognize, oh, it's not magic, it's a skill. It's a skill that we develop. All of these magic tricks with all of these cards are simply because the guy just spent a lot of time with cards. Flipping them and turning them and buying, let us say, 52 packs of cards so he can get 52 7 of hearts, so he can play 7 of heart tricks, but he's got a whole deck of cards, but there's nothing but 7 of hearts in there. And so when he spreads that deck out in front of somebody, it's actually a different deck that he's showing them. And then he takes that deck and says, okay, this has got all the 52 cards, there's no magic here, and then he puts that deck down and picks up the deck, and you don't see him do that. And this deck has only got 52 7 of Hearts in it. And so naturally, he can shuffle and plittle and do all kinds of things and tap and say, okay, you choose the card, and here it comes, 7 of Hearts. How could that possibly be? The answer to that is because you pulled it out of a deck that only had 7 of Hearts in it. Okay, that's the magic trick that we have, and we have to recognize that that there is no real magic. There is only, let us say, lack of perception. We didn't see what happened. And so now we're going to take that as information to recognize we need to look really closely. We need to see what's really going on inside the mind, because the mind doesn't come up with Magical Seven of Hearts either, that we rigged our own deck and we didn't even know we'd rigged our own deck.

**Speaker A:** It's like, oh, I like this, and then it turns out bad. I'm like, oh, why am I suffering now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, why am I suffering? Right. And the answer is we don't have the skills to see what we did. And so, the whole teaching of Paticcasamuppada, the whole teaching of Anapanasati is to teach us to really look at what we're doing, so that we wind up not being confused, that we can see what's going on, that we see that our feelings come from our perceptions, they don't come from anyplace else. And normally the feelings come from not perceiving things the way that they really are. That we've added something to it out of our past. And so how we begin to practice is by getting to control your feelings. If you could control the feelings, then you can begin to feel the way that you want to. This is first Jhana, is to being able to control the feelings, because if you can see that you can control the feelings, then you can unravel the mechanism that brings about these feelings. That's the perception. How do we perceive things is the base of our feelings, not what really happened.

**Speaker A:** Wow. All I can say is wow.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's exactly what those five images are pointing out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And there is a stage where we have to be at one with the universe. I actually recommend that. Why? Because that means that we're spending a lot of time in sensory input. We're taking in data. We're the only confusion we're having is that there is a me there that's taking in data. We could come to that conclusion also. And recognize, no, it's just data. I'm part of the data if there's a me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And especially when you're really, really deep in Dukkha, the witness stage is kind of like a nice little life raft to hold on to. Like, oh, I'm not my Dukkha, I'm the awareness of the Dukkha. So it's kind of like a witness stage where it's like, but that's not even close to even the being one with everything, which is it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but that's why this is a sequence of events. Yeah, you have to go through those skill developments, and as we develop the skills, we can recognize that there is only consciousness. There is no self in that consciousness, nor even the idea that I am at one with the universe. That's still a conceptualized perspective rather than just merely being in sensory input.

**Speaker A:** And even the consciousness is impermanent too.

**Speaker B:** Everything is temporary, everything is impermanent, nothing stays the same.

**Speaker A:** Right. And that's the problem. I think in some non-dual insight or traditions, you may get to everything is consciousness. But now you latch on to consciousness. Now you see consciousness, you take ownership of consciousness. And then that leads to Dukkha. And then people wonder why, like, And then now you're in a state of denial about not having any Dukkha because you've seen that everything is consciousness. But the only problem is that you're attached to the consciousness.

**Speaker B:** And so the answer to that will never mind, start again. But just keep coming back to it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's beautiful. It's been a good talk.

**Speaker B:** I'm really pleased with your progress, Scott. I'm pleased.

**Speaker A:** I can't thank you enough. I can't thank you enough. And all the teachers before you and the Buddha, the whole— Right. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Gratitude, that's good stuff.

**Speaker A:** Warms you up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right, Scott, well, we'll see you later. This has been a great talk. I really enjoyed this.

**Speaker A:** All right, see ya.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Scott (Speaker A) and other Sangha friends, centers on the practical relationship between **Jhana (meditative absorption)**, **Paticcasamuppada (Dependent Origination)**, and how we process sensory experience to end suffering.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: Jhana & Dependent Origination Are Experiential, Not Just Conceptual**
*   The teachings on Dependent Origination and the Jhanas are not just lists to memorize, but **states of mind to be directly experienced**. The Jhanas represent specific points in the process of Dependent Origination where the mind is calm and clear enough to see the links in action.

### **The Two Types of Consciousness**
A major clarification is offered on the Buddhist term "consciousness" (*viññāṇa*):
1.  **Raw Sensory Input (Viññāṇa):** This is the pure data from the senses (e.g., colors, sounds). The Buddha defines consciousness primarily as this incoming data stream—"eye-consciousness," "ear-consciousness," etc.
2.  **Processed Consciousness (Saññā/Saḷāyatana):** This is when the mind processes, labels, and conceptualizes the raw input (e.g., "That's a bird," "I see what you mean"). This is where "perception" (*saññā*) and the six sense bases (*saḷāyatana*) operate.

### **The Problem: Processing Creates Suffering**
*   Our default mode is to constantly **process and label** raw experience. This creates a bottleneck, limiting the vast amount of sensory data we can receive.
*   This processing uses **old data (past conditioning)** to interpret the new, leading to "liking" or "disliking" (*vedanā*), which then fuels craving (*taṇhā*) and the entire chain of suffering (*dukkha*).

### **The Solution: Develop the Skill to Receive Without Processing**
*   The path is to develop the skill of **receiving more raw data with less processing**. This is like formatting a hard drive to be "raw" again, not storing and clinging to interpretations.
*   **The Jhanas are the training ground for this skill:**
    *   **First Jhana:** Develops the skill to **sustain wholesome thoughts and control feelings** (*pīti*, *sukha*). This begins to calm the mind and alter perception (*saḷāyatana*).
    *   **Progression:** As one moves through the Jhanas, the processing slows. The first three Jhanas deal with what we "do with" the input, while the **Fourth Jhana** is where we learn to "stop doing"—to observe without interference.
*   **Advanced States Explained:** The so-called "formless attainments" (infinite space, infinite consciousness, etc.) are **not separate Jhanas** but **aspects or insights that arise from the profound equanimity of the Fourth Jhana**.
    *   "Infinite space" is better understood as **boundlessness**—seeing through the illusion of hard boundaries between self and world.
    *   "Neither perception nor non-perception" is the subtle boundary where just a trace of perception remains to be aware of consciousness itself.
    *   The ultimate point is **cessation**: bringing perception to a stop, which ends mental contact (*phassa*) and feeling (*vedanā*). This is a temporary but profoundly liberating insight into the end of suffering.

### **Practical Application & The "Five Pictures"**
*   The talk was sparked by five pictures depicting stages of insight. The middle picture ("I am one with everything") is a **major step** beyond ordinary separation, but it's still a *perception* containing a subtle sense of self.
*   The final goal is **prior to that perception**: just pure sensory input ("seeing, seeing, seeing") without any "I" being part of it, even a cosmic one.
*   The key **practice** is to use the calm, sustained attention of First Jhana to investigate the moment **"liking"** arises. By catching it and asking "Why do I like this?" or simply observing the mechanism of liking itself, one can create an "eddy" in the flow of Dependent Origination and prevent it from automatically turning into craving.

### **Conclusion: It's About Skill, Not Magic**
*   Enlightenment or deep insight is **not a mystical event** but the result of developing **attainable skills** in managing attention and perception.
*   Like a magician's trick, suffering arises because we don't see the hidden mechanism (our own conditioned processing). The Dharma provides the instructions to look closely and see the trick for what it is.
*   The entire path is about moving from being lost in processed reality (concepts, stories, self) to resting in direct, unprocessed experience, thereby unraveling the chain of suffering at its root.

**In essence:** The talk is a practical guide to using meditative concentration (Jhana) to experientially understand how the mind creates suffering (Dependent Origination) and to develop the skill of "just seeing" to bring that process to a halt.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several core **metaphors and stories** to explain complex Buddhist concepts like consciousness, perception, and the Jhanas. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **The Computer Hard Drive (Data Storage & Processing):**
    *   **Raw vs. Formatted:** Consciousness is compared to a hard drive partition. **"Raw"** consciousness is the pure, unprocessed sensory input (seeing, hearing, etc.). **"Formatted"** consciousness is when we process and label that input (e.g., "I see a tree"), which allows us to store and cling to concepts. The goal is to "remove the formatting" and leave the drive raw, not clinging to sensory input.

2.  **Data Processing (Old vs. Modern Computers):**
    *   **Unit Record Equipment (Punch Cards):** Represents the ordinary, ignorant mind. Processing is slow, mechanical, and happens at the speed of input (like a punch card making a physical contact). It does "very little processing," analogous to our habitual, automatic reactions.
    *   **Modern Computer:** Represents a mind beginning to practice wisdom. It can read data (sensory input) and then process it separately. The goal is to "do more reading and less processing"—taking in vast amounts of sensory data without immediately labeling or reacting to it.

3.  **The Orchestra:**
    *   Used to illustrate the cost of selective perception. If you focus on identifying one instrument (the oboe), you miss the entire symphony in that moment. Letting go of labeling allows you to experience the full, rich input ("hear the sound of the whole orchestra").

4.  **The Falling Apple:**
    *   A story to illustrate the 12 links of **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada)** in action:
        *   **Just Seeing:** Merely observing "falling" (raw consciousness, *viññāṇa*).
        *   **Perception/Labeling:** "An apple is falling" (*saññā*/*saḷāyatana*).
        *   **Feeling & Craving:** "I like apples. I want that apple" (*vedanā*, *taṇhā*).
        *   **Clinging & Suffering:** Picking it up and thinking, "This is *my* apple" (*upādāna*, *dukkha*).
    *   The practice is to stop at "just seeing."

5.  **The Oil-Soaked Clay Bowl:**
    *   Used to explain the subtle state of **"neither perception nor non-perception."** Even after draining the oil (removing perception), a trace remains soaked into the clay. Similarly, a tiny, residual bit of perception is needed to be conscious of sensory input at all. Letting go of even that last trace leads to the next stage.

6.  **Magic Tricks (Prestidigitation):**
    *   Represents the "magical" or mysterious quality of suffering and mental phenomena. What seems like a miracle (e.g., "Why do I always suffer?") is actually the result of unseen skills and tricks—our own hidden mental habits (like a rigged deck of cards). Awakening is "seeing through" the trick to the underlying mechanism.

### **Supporting Stories & Analogies:**

*   **Sawing Wood / Furniture Making:** Developing meditative skills is compared to moving from simply being able to saw wood to having the refined skills to measure, plan, and build furniture. The Jhanas are those developed skills.
*   **The "Infinite" vs. "Boundless" Correction:** The speaker argues that formless attainments like "infinite space" are better understood as **"boundless."** He uses the example of grains of sand to argue true mathematical infinity is impossible, and the real insight is the **dissolution of perceived boundaries** (e.g., between skin and air).
*   **The Five Pictures (Referenced throughout):** While not described in detail, these pictures serve as a **pictorial story** representing stages from separation ("I and the bird are separate") to oneness ("I am one with everything") to, presumably, a state beyond even that conceptual oneness. The speaker confirms they are a "pictorial representation of the fourth jhana."

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors:**

*   **Flood of Input:** Letting go of processing allows for a "flood" or huge increase of pure sensory information.
*   **Eddies in the Stream:** The linear 12 links of Dependent Origination are described as having "eddies and circles," meaning the process can be observed and interrupted at points like the feeling of "liking."
*   **Life Raft:** The "witness" stage in non-dual traditions (observing suffering) is called a "nice little life raft"—a helpful but interim stage, not the final goal.

**In summary,** the speaker primarily uses **technology metaphors (computers, data processing)** to demystify consciousness and perception, and **simple, tangible stories (apples, orchestras, magic tricks)** to illustrate the psychological process of suffering and the path to end it. The goal is to move from a mind that constantly processes and labels to one that can receive experience openly and without clinging.
