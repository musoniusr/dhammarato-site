### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Alex, it's good to see you again. I missed you yesterday because, um, let us say I took the day off, so the night before I was up all night.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what were you doing all night, huh? Were you having a party?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yes. In a way, uh, reconfiguring, uh, the server.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** That's what was going on. Uh, the whole idea is eventually to be able to get as much of the data online simultaneously as possible. That's been a long, long, uh, plan.

**Speaker B:** What data? What data?

**Speaker A:** Um, backed up about 240, 250 terabytes of data, but online at one time without the backups being online would be about 120 terabytes.

**Speaker B:** And why do you want that online?

**Speaker A:** 4-terabyte drives. And so get it all configured with that. So basically what I'm doing is that I'm taking older drives offline and making all the older drives 4-terabyte drives and so use it as backups.

**Speaker B:** Why would you like it online?

**Speaker A:** Why not?

**Speaker B:** I mean, is it like a convenience?

**Speaker A:** Well, right. I mean, uh, if we want to watch a particular movie, why should I have to go dig the hard drive that it's all in?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And mount it and, and, uh, and go through the configuration and what other drives have to come offline so that I could put that drive online, etc.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right, so my question— nobody cares anyway.

**Speaker A:** It's, let us say, it's a, it's a, uh, it's a rule.

**Speaker B:** I was curious about it. I was curious.

**Speaker A:** So that's a, that's a hobby. It's a hobby.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker A:** An old hobby started in the 1990s.

**Speaker B:** Well, um, Dan did tell me you like movies. Like to watch movies.

**Speaker A:** So no, I don't watch movies.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you don't watch movies?

**Speaker A:** Not the way that people watch movies. Not for that.

**Speaker B:** I know you don't watch movies the way people watch them. You, you've watched them to enjoy how they did things behind the scenes, how they put the movie together, to see the file or not, how is— how the file was taken.

**Speaker A:** Was it taken out of film onto— yes. Stuff like that. Yeah. And the other side of that is, how many movies can I find online and download?

**Speaker B:** You can find a lot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I have over the years. In the very, very beginning, it was only to go after music. But after I have more than one complete full collection, I'm talking about videos of Wagnerian operas, that type of stuff, as well as I take about 3 or 4 different copies of all of Beethoven's complete works with various artists and things like that. By the way, that music stuff doesn't take much. All of my music collection of more than maybe 200,000 pieces of music still only fill up 2 terabytes.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, I gotta ask you legitimately, do you really think it's sinister?

**Speaker A:** Uh, let us put it this way, uh, now that I pointed that out for you You figure it out for yourself. Well, you're just— everything that I have teach everybody that I teach everything to is I point things out and then let them figure it out for themselves.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're weirding me out now. I don't know what to think about it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, don't then.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** So yes, it depends upon what— an example would be on that one is if the girl goes for tall, dark, and handsome, then the darkness would be perhaps a mustache. That in fact, in the old days, they would put shoe polish on a brown mustache just to make it black. That facial hair care had been a major, major issue through Western civilization, but doesn't mean so much in other cultures because of, for instance, Asians and American Indians and many others don't have much facial hair.

**Speaker B:** So how does that make it sinister though?

**Speaker A:** Well, it darkens the face and makes light dark, that kind of thing. Okay. All right. It also has to do with, uh, uh, uh, the culinary— excuse me, um, uh, the, the arts of, for instance, the monks shave. That when the cowboys are out on the field, they don't shave. But when they come into town, before they even go to the bar, many of them will go to the barber to get shaved. Okay, and shaving has to do again with cleaning up. All right, so there's that whole The history of that. This is why in the movies the villains will have a mustache, and in the cowboy movies the villain will have a black hat.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, I mean, I certainly understand they were depicted that way, but Black people have been depicted as villains too, and we would call that racism.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly so. But that doesn't stop that mentality from happening just because you can see it better and call it racism with more intelligence. That yes, there are people who can see a mustache as hair, but most of the people see it as a symbol of something or another.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I see what you're saying. So you're saying that this could potentially impact the way I'm treated or seen?

**Speaker A:** Yes, which negatively, and you may not even know it, right?

**Speaker B:** Which kind of leads to Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, right?

**Speaker A:** So Good. Now that I pointed that out, you can be aware of it to see.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Well, good.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** I appreciate that.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point is to point stuff out for people.

**Speaker B:** It would help if you preface it with that next time because I didn't really know where you were going. I literally thought you were making like a real remark that it's sinister, that there's inherently sinisterness in it.

**Speaker A:** And we both know that's not true. Wait a minute, there is no soap in anything.

**Speaker B:** Okay, good.

**Speaker A:** And even the air is just molecules of glycerin and protein and all kinds of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, babe. Okay, so can I ask you my question now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** All right, so, um, as I've noticed you know, my enthusiasm has gotten really, really strong with— well, whatever. It's gotten really great, great enthusiasm just with everything relating to the practice. And what I've noticed is that after I do some deep, long inhales and exhales and really enjoy those, there's this great vast spaciousness that I start to experience. And I don't know if it's awareness or satisfaction or what. It seems like it's definitely— don't have to label it. Yeah, it feels good. It feels good. And then what I'll do is I'll lay there.

**Speaker A:** You like it? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And what I'll do then is I'll lay there and I'll start to focus on the sensations until they become kind of like on, you know, they're like differentiated, and then gradually they become the same like plane of sensation.

**Speaker A:** Well, guess what? It's not the sensations that's changing. It's your perception.

**Speaker B:** I know, I know, actually.

**Speaker A:** I know that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not this. I'm so glad you said that, because that's exactly what I'm experiencing. The perceptions are what is changing. But today I woke up and there was— it was everything was very cloudy, everything was very blurry. Everything felt very spacious and light, which was enjoyable. Except it was also disorienting a little bit. So my question is, is it to my benefit to follow my enthusiasm to explore these kinds of practices and this play with the practices if they are enjoyable yet bring some disorientation? Because that disorientation also caused unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** And so— No, disorientation doesn't cause unwholesome thoughts. In this case, The disorientation causes fear, and the fear causes the unwholesome thoughts. This is going in the other order. So that disorientation, though, of the lack of skill— okay, here's an idea. Think of it as the disorientation means that you move from here to here. And then more disorientation as you move from there. And then you get more disorientation and you move to here and you get more disorientation and you move to here. And disorientation and disorientation, disorientation starts to show up. Okay. And the issue is, is can you get off of that wheel and draw back to it to recognize that your disorientation is because you're having too short-term or narrow focus? Rather than recognizing that you're actually opening up to wider things that are happening. So, okay, the disorientation is seeing something new. This is what we're looking for, is this present moment is a new moment. Let it— allow it to be enthusiastically— allow it to be disorienting. Why? What is orientation anyway? It is the definition according to a set of standards or rules. And as you're breaking out of your own box, you're coming out of the orientation, and you're calling it disorientation. As left, that was, um, let us say, a negative word, when another word we could use would be freedom. Freedom is disorientation.

**Speaker B:** This is interesting. So just as in the beginning, when all these unwholesome thoughts, you know, were coming back again and back again and back again, and there was like this dissatisfaction upon seeing them. And it was, that was so intense, right? And we learned to kind of like, congratulate ourselves through that, and be satisfied even in their arising.

**Speaker A:** Now, The like, and by doing that, and by becoming satisfied with them, you're actually changing them right there in that moment, changing them right there in that moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So now, just as like, when you work out and you lift weights, if you keep lifting that same weight over and over and over again, eventually you plateau. So you need to change it up. You need to, you know, add weight or change the reps or whatever it is. And so What's happening? If you want something, right? I guess it's not a good example.

**Speaker A:** How long are you going to keep ramping things up, keeping wanting more and bigger muscles? I mean, you've seen some of these guys, Alexander— no, Arnold. Arnold quit doing that. Whether he made a good governor of California, I'm not sure, but he had to stop lifting weights to do that. He had to give it up.

**Speaker B:** Wait, so are you saying the disorientation is a reflection of me wanting to— No, I'm talking about pumping.

**Speaker A:** The example of pumping that you were using. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. Not a good example.

**Speaker A:** One level to another level to another level. But I can't just do it with a 2-pound or 2-kilogram dumbbell. I've got to have a 5-kilogram dumbbell.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, not a great example.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what example I would use, but it is like the next— Whatever example that you use, you can either reach it through struggle and want because the level that you're at is not good enough, or you can't improve by developing the skills of feeling good enough right now with what you've got right now. And those skills will be developed, and so you actually begin to rise without any effort to it, as opposed to the model that you're using is just more effort and more wanting and more struggle and going further and further. In other words, the hot air balloon is already free as soon as that final rope is cut. Even though it's still hovering 3 feet above the ground, it's still free, and it's only going to go up because it's got more lift.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. So what was the rope getting cut in this case?

**Speaker A:** Well, the ropes are always the betters, and the last better that you threw out was that I've got to work harder, I've got to pump iron more and more, I've got to get more done. In other words, another way of saying it is, is there you are swatting at imaginary ropes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** As your hot air balloon goes off into the air you're leaning over the side of the basket with your axe whacking at ropes that don't exist. You're already free.

**Speaker B:** In fact, I guess that's probably what we were doing anyway in the very beginning. We were whacking at ropes that didn't exist. We just didn't see that they didn't exist yet.

**Speaker A:** Yes, now you're beginning to get the point. Exactly. We've all been whacking that rope. Yeah. They're not there, they're only mental. Okay, so getting back to that point then about enthusiasm, there is very, very good reasons to promote enthusiasm. Another word that we could use for it would be eagerness, that in fact the Buddha himself talks about it as part of the path. That there comes a time on the path when it's no longer work or drudgery is when we begin to get really enthusiastic about the path. That's one of the things that I appreciate about you is that you've got this enthusiasm which is necessary for the path. And when people don't have that enthusiasm, they don't have that eagerness, then they have to come up with some other thing. To use instead, like devotion or dedication or determination, right? But enthusiasm is different than that. Yeah, and what I've noticed with enthusiasm is determination says that I want something very badly that I don't have, and enthusiasm is relishing in that you've already got it. And so we become eager, for instance, to just to hear more Dhamma, eager to find more Dhamma everywhere because it's so satisfying. We get quite a hit out of it, so we'll keep looking for it, and there it is in front of us, ready to be found. It's sort of like, um, you've seen some movies. One of the examples would be that finally, after climbing the stalk, they got up to wherever it is, and there's the goose that lays the golden eggs, and there's golden eggs all over the place. And they go, yippee! And I'll get that one, and I'll get that one, and I'll get that one. That's the enthusiastic base. And the Buddha highly promotes that, that this is in fact the state of Srotapanna, is that enthusiasm for the Dharma, the being willing to jump into the Dharma any time. Okay, to be in it, to be in that stream, to be in that flow enthusiastically. And also, um, kind of the last phase of that would be, you could say, that the enthusiasm then going through the process of a dry desert, then you find the lake, then you rush towards the lake, but now you only put your toe in trepidation. Maybe it's cold. When do you finally take the plunge and jump in? And then you swim around. Then comes the phase where now you're just laying on your back and floating. So those are the very stages that you would go through, from the desert to finding the water, to running, to putting the toe in, to jumping in, swimming around. And finally, okay, so now you're enthusiastically running down the hill. You found the water, it's right in front of you. That's because everybody else is caught in the desert. Everybody else is an ordinary person. Everybody else thinks there's nothing, uh, there is no end to the misery. I guess it's dry. Okay. Yeah. And now you know that things are not dry. You've had just enough taste of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so you gotta enthusiastically go after it. So this is actually, uh, an important part of, uh, the path— that enthusiasm, that ego. So Gotta know more of it. You gotta have more. Gotta have— yeah, can't get enough of those Cheerios. Can't get enough of that Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** It sounds like there's some Dukkha in that though.

**Speaker A:** Well, there is, but that's a phase to go through. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You've gotta climb the tree, and you have to do enthusiasm to climb the tree, but the perch at the top of the tree, you're not there yet, but you've got the enthusiasm for climbing the tree.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. There's no— there's, uh, we're not finished with the path yet, but enthusiasm is really necessary. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So, uh, Dhammarato, past few days there's been a lot of moments where I would say actually it's been like floating for me. Everything was just cool.

**Speaker A:** Everything was floating, right? So guess what is that? I just gave you an example from the desert to the floating and all of the steps between it, and you got the idea that this is a one-time shot. One desert, one seeing, one running down the hill, one toe in, one jumping in, over and over and over and over again. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** You mean I gotta go back to the desert?

**Speaker A:** Up to you.

**Speaker B:** I don't want to go back to the desert. Well, I'm fine.

**Speaker A:** Wakey wakey, be very careful. So this is exactly the same thing as when, uh, the, uh, that it actually is part of Christianity, but I've seen it in Hinduism and Islam also. And that is, is that we have no idea that heaven exists. Why is that? Why is it that no one comes back from heaven to tell us what it's all about? And the answer to that is, those who make it there, they don't want to come back here long enough to talk about it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, can I share something with you?

**Speaker A:** That's all right, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So there's a hindrance that is here, that is there, that has been there for most of today, and I just want like your help to kind of get through that. So I told you today when I woke up there was like that disorientation, right? And I guess that brought on fear. And then there were unwholesome thoughts, and I just kept throwing them out. It was like, oh, congratulations, great success. I'm satisfied. It's okay. Everything's all right. Everything's fine. But they were coming up a lot faster and a lot more often than they have been for weeks.

**Speaker A:** So it was like, Oh, you can't blame that on the box. What you can say instead is, is that your skill at being able to see that stuff quickly is developing skill. And the skill means is that, um, imagine this: you open the door to a darkened room, but there's enough light that comes in through the door that you can see a mess, and you start cleaning up that mess, and then somebody comes in and turns the lights on, or you turn the lights on, and now you see a really, really big mess. Okay, well, that's what's happening with you as you begin to make some space in your room and getting some skills going at identifying what is a mess.

**Speaker B:** You're beginning to see mess everywhere, even if there's been so much satisfaction and such great just equanimity and joy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and you can just keep coming back to that. Never mind all of that stuff, I can still be joyful and satisfied. And then by changing it right then and there, keep changing that, come back to the satisfaction. Rather than being impressed about how often the unwholesome thoughts come, be impressed about every one of them being thrown back out again.

**Speaker B:** I guess I just got surprised today because for a while it hasn't been like that, and it kind of scared me. I thought, I thought I was kind of going backwards.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, so what if you go backwards? Can you be satisfied now with going backwards, which is backwards? Can you be satisfied with not getting what you want? Oh man, you don't want to go backwards. Well, guess what? You're going to have some really backwards days.

**Speaker B:** I know, actually, Dan was telling me about this at one point. He said, like, you know, there are days and weeks where I would be in the ditch. And now, maybe the ditch are these days when those unwholesome thoughts are showing up more, but I can skillfully handle them way better than I could when I was in the ditch, because when I was in the ditch, I wasn't handling them. I was just at the effect of all of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So that's another way of saying it is that if you're in the ditch, the likelihood of you falling in the ditch is less. But if you keep coming out of the ditch, the more often you come out of the ditch, the more likely you're going to go back into the ditch, right? Which means now that you're coming out of the ditch often, that means you're going back in the ditch often. Before, you didn't go into the ditch often because you just did it. Now that you're coming out of the ditch often, going back into the ditch often. That's the skill. That's the skill. Now, and the skill that we're developing is the skill of coming out of the ditch. Okay, that's the skill we're developing. It's the skill coming out of the ditch. Get that. I got you. That idea. Oh, that's important.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, go ahead. Right, say it again.

**Speaker A:** And you're fussing at yourself for going into the ditch, and we're not even developing that skill. We're developing the skill of coming out of the ditch. Not hating ourselves for falling in the ditch. So every unwholesome thought is just another opportunity to practice coming out of the ditch. So don't see falling into the ditch as going backwards. It's just another opportunity to practice the skill of coming out of the ditch.

**Speaker B:** Okay, there's just been resistance. I think that's what— there's been resistance to seeing the unwholesome thoughts today.

**Speaker A:** Another ditch. That's just another ditch.

**Speaker B:** Just another ditch.

**Speaker A:** Just another ditch.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of back to that, like, no, I don't care. I don't care what Alex thinks right now or what Alex wants. I'm just— I'm enjoying right now. I'm being satisfied right now. A little dab will do you. There's a little dab here. This is fine. Oh, I don't believe you. Oh, I see you. Congratulations. No problem. That's not— no worries, everything's okay.

**Speaker A:** We'll see what's going on is, is that as you're cleaning out your room, you're finding new garbage, and you're running to me and say, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, what do I do with this new garbage? The answer is, well, what have you been doing with all the old garbage?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's It's just that when you experience the success and the satisfaction and the joy and the garbage is cleaned out, most of the garbage is cleaned out, and then when you come back and you start seeing the garbage again, you start to doubt your ability to skillfully handle that.

**Speaker A:** But that doubt is just more garbage.

**Speaker B:** More garbage.

**Speaker A:** Garbage. Because the reality is, and not just the reality, but you can see that you have cleaned out. Yeah, that room is much cleaner now than it was before. You just haven't gotten all the cobwebs off, off of the corners. You haven't gotten the dirt out of the corners. There's still a lot of parts of the mind that need to be cleaned out. But take heart, you've already got things really cleaned up.

**Speaker B:** I mean, it is true, because I'll wake up in the morning and things are just different. I'm not as like pulled into it. It's just like, you know. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So keep going. Keep practicing.

**Speaker B:** Just got to trust it. Trust it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, actually, I trust not based upon that it may be okay, but rather the confidence of saying I can do this because I have been doing this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, trust. When I say trust, I mean that it's going to be okay because it's been okay. I'm able to do it. I can do it.

**Speaker A:** That's the kind of trust. Yeah, the trust that has verification, the trust that has evidence. Yeah, not the trust that has no discernible evidence anywhere.

**Speaker B:** So then basically, to recapture what you said, even though disorientation might happen and so on, I might see more garbage and on, the way here is to follow my enthusiasm, to go full on, head on into my enthusiasm and enjoy that.

**Speaker A:** Use that enthusiasm because enthusiasm now is a whole lot, now that you've got it, a whole lot easier than one's right effort to do it without any enthusiasm.

**Speaker B:** I got to be honest with you.

**Speaker A:** Everybody has to start. You have to start doing it without any enthusiasm at all, which means that now the effort is real effort.

**Speaker B:** Is it normal sometimes for it to seem like you're not— your effort isn't good enough or it's not right enough?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's just another hindrance. You're not good enough. Your whole life has not been good enough. You're still trying to be good enough, Alex. I keep telling you, you're already good enough. I just enjoy that you're already good enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's just a little stickier, that's all. It's just been a little sticky.

**Speaker A:** It really is. That's the whole point. You've been dabbling in that stuff for so many years, it's an old habit. Yeah, but the more you look at it like you are with me, and we keep looking at it, you recognize it's just the same old stuff. It's just the same old stuff.

**Speaker B:** It's just the same old stuff.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, it really is. It's the same old stuff. You're not good enough, Alex. You got to prove yourself here.

**Speaker B:** It's the same old stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. But that's the wisdom, is to recognize that these things have got to be connected.

**Speaker B:** I think the other reason and the other observation that I've been making is that as my satisfaction and joy grows and my ability to kind of be in this neutral, satisfied condition, Sometimes it appears as though that satisfied condition is not that satisfying anymore, like it loses its luster.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's just another unwholesome thought. You want the satisfaction to be at a certain level. So you could say also, aha, I see that thought too. That this little bit of satisfaction is satisfying enough. I don't have to have it at a Stage 3, a Stage 2.

**Speaker B:** So I mean, Dhammarato, my instinct was to just keep on doing the breathing throughout the day and keep up the Anapanasati and forget Vipassana practices, forget about— You are already doing Vipassana.

**Speaker A:** This is Vipassana. This is Vipassana on steroids.

**Speaker B:** I know, I mean, okay. I mean, when I'm laying down and I'm focusing on the sensations because that stuff is what brings on the disorientation. But you're saying that's okay. I can keep on doing that no matter how disorienting it gets because the way to go is to really let go into that disorientation.

**Speaker A:** Begin to like the disorientation.

**Speaker B:** Begin to enjoy it. Okay. All right. I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can do that.

**Speaker B:** I can be satisfied and not get what I want. And I can— maybe we can switch that now. Maybe it's more like I can just be satisfied. Yeah, I can be satisfied with this. I can be satisfied with this.

**Speaker A:** The wanting was optional already.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because when I say not get what I want, it kind of almost like brings it back into existence, the wanting.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, Samadhi, you don't love that. In the beginning, you had to recognize that you did want something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And now you're recognizing, hey, I can want something and be satisfied. And now you're recognizing, hey, I don't have to even want to and be satisfied. I could just be satisfied. Just be satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's exactly— because wanting is the whole— yeah, it's the whole problem right there.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Wanting is the whole problem.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's continue on with this. Use that enthusiasm. Recognize that the, uh, the, the next new unwholesome thought will be just as tricky as the last unwholesome thought. And their skill is being developed is to be able to see that that's also just another unwholesome thought. Yeah. All the thrill is gone. Oh, where's my Dukkha? Or where's my Sukkha? You know?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, that right there.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** But then that's like, oh, I could just be satisfied even if there's no evidence. Is that right? Even if there's no evidence to be satisfied. Because before, it was easy to be like, oh, there's all this evidence.

**Speaker A:** You do have evidence. You're still alive. You're still able to breathe. The air that you're breathing is not full of soot and pollution. You can take a deep breath. Wow, what a satisfying thing to do. You get another 2 minutes to live because you took a deep breath. How satisfying is that? So the reality is, is that there's plenty to be satisfied for.

**Speaker B:** Oh, can I tell you one thing real quick? I forgot to say, um, I actually wanted to tell you two days ago, but we didn't get to talk. I was starting to notice that satisfaction as an object. Like all of the satisfaction I can be experiencing in a moment, I was able to see it as like an object, kind of like a thought.

**Speaker A:** You are not the satisfaction either. It's just an object of Vinaya.

**Speaker B:** So no wonder it's not there because I've been seeing it. It's on its way out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Huh.

**Speaker B:** Well, then why does it appear like there's less satisfaction now that that object's gone?

**Speaker A:** That's just another thought. You keep trying to make things go according to your plans, according to your rules, according to how things should be.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** And see how sneaky that stuff is?

**Speaker B:** It's sneaky. It's sneaky. It's really sneaky. Yeah, you just have to say a few things and I'm on. I know what you're saying. I gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, excellent. Yeah, got that one too. Great, Alex. I'm really pleased with your progress. You're doing great, man.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. So just to recapture, you don't want anything. I could just be satisfied with this right here. There's no— see, the unwholesome thought is wholesome thoughts. Return to that satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** They can be really sneaky.

**Speaker B:** It can be really sneaky. It doesn't have to look any way. Oh yeah, and learn to enjoy the disorientation. Enjoy the disorientation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just enjoy the fact that things are up in the air now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because the disorientation that I'm experiencing now is it feels exactly like, not exactly, but similar to how it felt when you and I first started talking, actually. Feels similar to that, like that there's all this Dukkha around, but there's not, there's not like a bunch of unwholesome thoughts coming up, but it feels like there is. Does that make sense? But there's not actually, I don't see them, but it feels like there is.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but that's just more unwholesome thoughts. And yeah, we can just Never mind. Oh my God. Oh man.

**Speaker B:** Well, at least I can laugh at it. At least I can laugh at it.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly where we're coming to, is congratulations, making some friends with this stuff and recognize how sneaky it is, this little friend of ours.

**Speaker B:** Sneaky fuckers. Oh man, no wonder I decided to put the mustache on. My Duke is getting more sinister.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Alex, we will see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'll see you later. Thanks, thanks, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a student, Alex (Speaker B), revolves around two main themes: **skillful handling of hindrances in meditation** and the **role of enthusiasm on the path**. Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Themes & Teachings**

1.  **Enthusiasm (Eagerness) is Essential:** Dhammarato emphasizes that enthusiasm is a vital and encouraged part of the path. It is distinct from determination rooted in *wanting*. Enthusiasm is the joy of relishing the Dhamma you are already experiencing—like finding a lake in a desert and eagerly diving in. This eagerness is a sign of progress and a powerful motivator.

2.  **"Disorientation" is Actually Freedom:** Alex describes a "spacious" but disorienting state from his practice. Dhammarato reframes this not as a problem, but as **freedom from old mental frameworks**. What we label as disorientation is often the mind breaking out of its conditioned "box" and perceiving new, wider realities. The instruction is to **learn to enjoy this disorientation** as a sign of growth.

3.  **The "Ditch" Metaphor for Unwholesome Thoughts:** When Alex is distressed by a resurgence of unwholesome thoughts, Dhammarato offers a key analogy:
    *   Life is like repeatedly falling into a ditch (unwholesome states).
    *   The **skill being developed is not "never falling in," but "coming out of the ditch."**
    *   Each unwholesome thought is therefore **an opportunity to practice the skill of release**. The goal is to stop berating yourself for falling in and instead celebrate each time you apply the antidote (satisfaction, recognition, letting go).

4.  **The Antidote is Satisfaction in the Present:** The consistent instruction for handling any hindrance—doubt, fear, unwholesome thoughts, or the sense that "satisfaction isn't good enough"—is to **return to a baseline of satisfaction with the present moment**. This could be as simple as finding satisfaction in a single breath. The practice is to see each negative state as "just another thought" or "more garbage" to be cleared, and to not get entangled in its story.

5.  **"You Are Already Good Enough":** A recurring point is the dismantling of the deeply ingrained thought, "I am not good enough." Dhammarato insists this is just another sneaky, unwholesome pattern. The practice involves recognizing this thought as "the same old stuff" and replacing it with the confidence born from direct experience: "I can do this because I *have been* doing this."

### **Flow of the Conversation**

*   The talk begins with a personal anecdote about Dhammarato's data-hoarding hobby, which transitions into an illustrative point about how perceptions (like seeing a mustache as "sinister") are culturally conditioned and can cause *dukkha* (suffering) if unexamined.
*   Alex then raises his main concern: his strong enthusiasm for practice has led to deep, spacious states that sometimes feel disorienting and have recently coincided with a resurgence of unwholesome thoughts, causing doubt.
*   Dhammarato reframes the disorientation as positive and addresses the unwholesome thoughts with the "ditch" metaphor. He guides Alex to see this not as regression, but as a sign of increased sensitivity and a chance to hone his skill of release.
*   The dialogue reinforces the core method: use enthusiasm, meet every hindrance with present-moment satisfaction, and don't believe the mind's sneaky narratives about not being good enough or needing things to be different.

### **Key Instructions for Practice**

*   **Follow your enthusiasm** for the Dhamma; it is a fuel for the path.
*   **Interpret disorientation as growth** and freedom from old mind-states.
*   **See every hindrance as "just another unwholesome thought"**—see it, label it, and return to satisfaction.
*   **Develop the skill of "coming out of the ditch,"** not of never falling in.
*   **Cultivate satisfaction with what is here and now**, independent of achieving any special state.
*   **Trust the evidence of your own experience** and progress, not the doubting thoughts.

In essence, the talk is a masterclass in **reframing obstacles as the path itself**. It encourages a joyful, enthusiastic, and resilient approach where every experience, pleasant or challenging, becomes raw material for developing wisdom and release.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories are used by **Speaker A (Dhammarato)** to guide **Speaker B (Alex)** through a discussion about spiritual practice, hindrances, and perception. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Stories:**

1. **The Hot Air Balloon & Ropes**
   * **Metaphor:** Freedom is like a hot air balloon that is already free once the last rope is cut, even if it’s still hovering near the ground. The "ropes" are our self-imposed burdens, beliefs, and efforts (like "I must work harder").
   * **Purpose:** To illustrate that Alex is already free; the struggle is against "imaginary ropes" that no longer exist. The path is about recognizing freedom, not striving for it.

2. **The Desert, Lake, and Swimming**
   * **Story/Stages:** The seeker starts in a desert (spiritual dryness), finds a lake (Dhamma), runs toward it, cautiously tests the water, finally jumps in, swims, and eventually floats effortlessly.
   * **Purpose:** To map the progressive stages of practice—from longing, to discovery, to initial hesitation, to full immersion, and finally to effortless abiding. Dhammarato clarifies this cycle repeats; it's not a one-time linear journey.

3. **Cleaning a Darkened Room**
   * **Metaphor:** The mind is like a room. Initially, you clean in dim light, seeing only some mess. As light increases (awareness grows), you see more mess (unwholesome thoughts) clearly.
   * **Purpose:** To explain why Alex might be noticing *more* unwholesome thoughts—not because things are worse, but because his perception has sharpened. The skill is in continuing to clean, not being dismayed by the newly visible clutter.

4. **The Ditch (Falling In and Climbing Out)**
   * **Metaphor:** Unwholesome states or hindrances are like falling into a ditch. The skill being developed is not *avoiding* the ditch, but the skill of *climbing out* quickly and without self-judgment.
   * **Purpose:** To reframe "setbacks" as core practice opportunities. Falling in is inevitable; the progress is in the increasing skill and ease of getting out.

5. **The Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs**
   * **Story:** A reference to the fable where someone finds a goose that lays golden eggs, leading to eager collection.
   * **Purpose:** To describe the **enthusiasm (eagerness)** for the Dhamma that arises on the path. Once you've tasted the "golden eggs" of insight and satisfaction, you naturally and enthusiastically seek more.

6. **Climbing a Tree**
   * **Metaphor:** The path is like climbing a tree. Enthusiasm is the energy needed to climb, even though the final perch (goal) isn't reached yet.
   * **Purpose:** To validate Alex's enthusiasm as a necessary fuel for the journey, even if it contains a subtle element of "wanting" (dukkha). It's a phase to be used skillfully.

7. **The Mustache & the Villain (Cultural Symbolism)**
   * **Metaphor/Story:** Dhammarato uses the example of mustaches and black hats in cowboy films being culturally coded as "sinister" or villainous. This is a metaphor for how perception is shaped by unconscious symbols and conditioning.
   * **Purpose:** To teach that our reactions (like fear or judgment) are often based on perceived "symbols" rather than reality. This links directly to the practice of seeing through perceptions to avoid unnecessary dukkha.

8. **Weightlifting / Pumping Iron**
   * **Metaphor:** (Introduced by Alex, then refined by Dhammarato) Alex initially uses weightlifting as a metaphor for progressive effort. Dhammarato counters it, suggesting the spiritual path is not about endless, effortful accumulation (bigger muscles), but about skill and release.
   * **Purpose:** To contrast the worldly model of "more effort = more gain" with the Dhamma model of "skillful understanding = natural release."

### **Overall Narrative Purpose:**
The metaphors and stories collectively build a coherent teaching:
*   They move Alex from a model of **striving and fixing** (weightlifting, digging out of ditches) to a model of **recognizing freedom and developing skillful perception** (hot air balloon, cleaning the room).
*   They normalize the challenges of the path (the repeating desert-lake cycle, the ever-more-subtle "mess" in the room).
*   They reframe potential discouragements (disorientation, more unwholesome thoughts) as signs of progress and opportunities for practice.

The dialogue itself becomes a meta-example of Dhammarato's method: **pointing things out** through relatable imagery and letting Alex **figure it out for himself**.
