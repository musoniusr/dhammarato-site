### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Together anyway.

**Speaker B:** Does it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it does.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker A:** So we were talking about the difference between bodily feelings and bodily sensations versus the feelings that the Buddha is talking about, the Vedana, which oftentimes is very fast. One example of that would be that the person will notice at some level, either subconsciously or consciously, will notice that the body is affected by adrenaline, and that one of the effects that adrenaline has is a kind of a tightness in the chest, and that that is often called anxiety, and people often don't like it. However, if they had just met a gorilla who was not acting pleasant, then that adrenaline would be the very thing that we needed to move on off. Yeah, get up and go. So the inappropriateness is that we don't like anxiety when in fact it is a biological function that has actually helped preserve the human species as well as each individual one of us. But right now, that anxiety is not appropriate, and we wind up not liking it. And by not liking it, we want to get rid of it. And by getting rid of it and not liking it, we're actually having the kind of thoughts that produced it in the first place. And therefore we will stay uptight and anxious because We're wanting something, we're struggling, we're desperately trying to get to it. And so the system says, OK, here's some adrenaline to help you do that. I have seen that happen with AI to where the Google speech thing and it's AI just gets things backwards.

**Speaker B:** Say again?

**Speaker A:** The AI gets things backwards sometimes. Oh, just like this. The thought is I want the anxiety to go away. Away, but the thought itself is saying, okay, we're going to help you get rid of the anxiety, here's some more adrenaline.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It causes more anxiety. However, if we can, when we see the anxiety, we can say, oh, I'm uptight and I may be afraid of— what was the kind of thoughts that I were having? Like, oh, I've got to go talk to the boss, or oh, I've got to go to the bank, or oh, I've got to go vote, or oh, I've got to go do this and that and the other thing. And that's what brought up the anxiety to begin with. And then we can recognize, oh, wait a minute, I don't have to go do that right now. I can sit here and just relax. And that adrenaline will drain right away. Why? Because we're not thinking about that which created it, nor are we thinking about the work that it takes to get rid of it. We're just saying, oh, I don't have to do that. All right, so we can in fact then act wisely about that adrenaline. And one of the things we do is to take a deep breath, maybe take a walk around the room, go change our posture, or do something nourishing. The same thing is true about tiredness, that when the body gets tired, that's almost like the lack of adrenaline, it's the lack of— and so we go, "I feel tired." Now, generally what happens is, is that we've got some sort of parent figure inside our head that says, you're not supposed to be tired right now, get up and do your job. And so we then say, oh, I should not be tired. I don't like being tired. And so that's when we create misery for ourselves about the tiredness. What we can do instead is say, Oh, I'm tired. That means that I need to make a change of pace. Maybe go take a short walk, maybe drink something. In fact, the cure for anxiety and the cure for tiredness, even though they're opposites, is the same thing. And that is to make a change, to do something different. And so if you're tired, go lay down. Then in fact, sometimes it says, I'm tired, I'm going to go lay down. And after I lay down, I think of something to do. And now I'm not tired anymore.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think what happens very often is I'm tired, so you lie down and then you go, I can't sleep and I don't like not sleeping. I've laid down here in order to sleep and it's not happening.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. So get up and get up again. So in a way, the mind can be okay, but the body can be tired. And that's— and so we go lay down and we think that, oh, because the body is tired, I must sleep. And now I can't get to sleep. In fact, that's something that our society— you could almost say that it is the pharmaceutical companies that are out there making profit off of lying to the people, saying you must sleep according to our schedule. You're supposed get 8 hours, you're supposed to do this, and that in fact old people don't need as much sleep as young people. Babies sleep all the time. Some go-getters and some elderly don't get much sleep. Okay, so a one-size-fits-all model of 8 hours of sleep doesn't work. But there is something that we can do. We can start changing our attitude of I must go to sleep and therefore I'm unhappy and dissatisfied because I can't get to sleep, there's another way of thinking about it. And the new way of thinking about it is to say, oh, I don't have to go anywhere right now. I can lay here and enjoy the night. I don't have to sleep. I can rest instead and rest the body and let the mind kind of drift into pleasant thoughts. Thoughts about how nice this bed is, how it's good to have a good temperature. It's a little bit cold. And I like the snuggling up with the blanket and just enjoying the night. And pretty soon we can go to sleep. But if we've got thoughts about, oh, I've got something to do tomorrow, I've got to go to sleep. Now the mind is very active and it's hard to go to sleep. Insomniacs literally talk themselves into insomnia.

**Speaker B:** Yes, of course.

**Speaker A:** And so then the pharmaceutical industry wants to sell them a pill, and if the pill works, that only meant that it was interfering with their cognitive ability. So they take their pill and then they can't think straight, and so the natural thing they do is to fall asleep. I would not recommend barbiturates. No.

**Speaker B:** In fact, no, I don't take them. I don't.

**Speaker A:** Sleeping pills are not necessary. Why? Because we don't need to sleep. What we need to do is to rest, and mostly what we need to do with resting is by resting out of the unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. And when you're laying— so we also need to investigate the issue of what you mean by the word meditation, because what I'm not talking— I'm not talking about doing a meditation, but we can use that word for it because of the lack of better words in English language. I generally prefer Anapanasati is what we're doing. So doing Anapanasati would be to just lay there and say, oh, this is so nice. Oh, I feel so comfortable. And sleep will come soon enough.

**Speaker B:** Well, I don't get this. I don't get this because the whole point about Anapanasati is concentrating on the breath, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** No, no, and no, 7 times no.

**Speaker B:** Then why is there all this thing in the sutta about following this particular.

**Speaker A:** Because you only read one line out of a four-page sutta.

**Speaker B:** No, I didn't read the one line out of the four-page sutta. I read all of it and it goes right through.

**Speaker A:** Mindfully breathe it. While mindfully breathing in and out, you gladden the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right, but you don't do it without mindfully breathing in the nose.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, but you don't have to do it in such an organized or high-polluting way. Instead, you can say, "Oh, this is so nice," and incorporate the practice of gladdening the mind, rather than saying, "Oh, I've got to watch the breath. Oh, I've got to gladden the mind. Oh, I've got to watch the breath." That's all way too much work. This is part of the reason why I don't want to call it meditation, and I certainly would not consider myself a meditation teacher.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. What we mean by that is, is that we're trying to rest the body, and by having a good in-breath and exhaust, we're resting the body. To rest the feelings, by stop our curiosity and stop our trying to solve problems and stop our greed and stop our wanting things to be different, and just enjoy the way things are. And then gladden the mind in the sense of everything is okay, nothing needs to be done. And so the Anapanasati actually is about all aspects of the body, not just the breathing. Now why the Goenka method does so much is basically because they don't have anything better to teach. But Anapanasati is being practiced if you are gladdening the mind, even if you're not watching the breath so closely. That we will take one object and then another object and then another object, but at any time we can come back to the breath as a base point. But the whole point about breathing is to experience the body, which we can do when we're laying in bed, and feel how nice it feels to lay on the bed. It's a comfortable bed, I've got covers on, and I can experience the body. And in that process, it can relax. But people who are insomniacs, and they've got a busy schedule or something on their mind, and they think that they've got to sleep, they're actually working. They're not resting. So changing on the attitude is the right way to do it, so that when we lay in bed, the attitude is everything is okay and I got nothing to do and no place to go. I don't need to get up and go fix that broken toilet. I don't need to get up and answer that phone if it's ringing. I don't need to go to sleep. I can just lay here and enjoy this moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that is, that is, yes, that's all, that's all massively counterintuitive, isn't it? Because, you know, I don't need to go to sleep because, well, I know damn fine that if I don't go to sleep, I'm going to feel awful.

**Speaker A:** Throughout the day, if you talk, if you spend— no, wait a minute, you've got a very, very limited context here. We need to shine a light on it so that you can see a couple of feet away from where you are. So your two choices are to either go to sleep or worry all night about not getting to sleep. And you can prove, because if you can get to sleep, then the next way you're okay, kind of. And if you don't go to sleep, sleep, then you're going to be messed up the next day because you have been worried and fretting and thinking about stuff all night. You have been burning all night rather than resting all night, where when you were asleep, you were resting. But just right beside sleep and rest is being awake and at rest. And so if you can be awake and at rest and actually rest yourself, including not telling yourself, oh, you've got to go to sleep, but rather telling yourself everything is okay right now, wow, this is nice, then you would naturally go into a sleep state. If we're practicing correctly, rest, the bottom line of rest, would be going to sleep. Especially if the body is tired. Now, it is possible, once we practice for a while, that we can be at rest and still wide awake. Yeah, and that's okay to be wide awake and at rest. But if you tell yourself, oh, I am at rest, but I'm wide awake and I should go to sleep, and I should go to sleep. Oh, I can't get— now you're not at rest anymore, but you're worried about getting to sleep. So the first thing that we need to practice with Anapanasati is to stop taking it out of the context that Western Buddhism has put it into, of a certain place, a certain time, a certain posture, a certain sitting position, and a certain activity. And take it out of that context into the context of when to practice— right now. What posture? Any— whatever posture I'm in right now. And that's practice, is when we remember it. Now, it may be for some people, especially beginners, easier to remember to practice correctly while they're doing it in a formal way. Lighting an incense and sitting in front of a Buddha statue and other things like that. That situation is very helpful for some people. But also other people will sit down with that incense and that candle and that Buddha statue and they're sitting on the hard floor and they don't like it. And now they're waiting for the bell to ring and they're thinking about all kinds of things, but they're not practicing correctly. Though they will call it, "I just had an hour of meditation," and they didn't do any of the stuff that we're talking about in Anapanasati. So meditation is kind of like a formal way of looking at it. In a way, it's the distinction, and you've heard this before, the letter of the law versus the spirit of the law. And so we're letting meditation is the letter of the law, you're supposed to do this, you're supposed to do that, I read it in the book, and all of that, the way the you've got it is to get it all right according to the letter of the law, and that what we're trying to do is to change that into the reference of the spirit of the law, recognizing that there's some key words in the Anapanasati Sutra, and if we'll just get those few key words, it'll work correctly. But if we try to do it all, it's so much hard work. And one of the keys of the Anapanasati Sutta is step 4, to relax, just relax. Okay, another key word in the Anapanasati Sutta would be to just gladden the mind, to change our frame of reference, to change the mind state, to gladden the mind. And the way that we can help do that is by having wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** What I find myself doing, especially recently, in fact, is letting the breath go.

**Speaker A:** And what do you mean?

**Speaker B:** Letting it go and letting it go out until effectively I'm sort of— well, finally, the belly starts to squeeze out the breath. And I'm effectively not breathing in until, you know, the body sort of requires me to breathe in, and I then take a long breath, and that is absolutely wonderfully relaxing doing that.

**Speaker A:** And of course— Okay, so may I ask you the question then? Now that you've said that, so what's wrong with that? Why are you complaining about it?

**Speaker B:** Why am I complaining? I'm not— well, because—.

**Speaker A:** Well, because you've heard that you're supposed to be watching the breath all the time.

**Speaker B:** All the time. That's the one.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's it. I caught you. All the time is the major enemy of the Western Dhamma dude. That situation of all the time is our major enemy. Why? Because when we see that we weren't doing it all the time, we fuss at ourselves, "Oh, you should have been doing it all the time." Well, so let's use— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** You read that you are supposed to watch the breath all the way in and all the way out effectively.

**Speaker A:** That's one instruction in one situation. It's not a general thing. Because in fact, the next step is to breathe in short, mindfully knowing that you're breathing in short. So let us make sure now that we've got a lot of stuff on our plate. And that what people do is that they will eat certain things off the plate because they're supposed to, and other people will eat off the plate what they want to eat. And the correct way to do it is to just sample this and that. Look around, check things out, rather than eating only what you're supposed to eat or eating only what you like to eat. But rather just check things out. And so this idea of having rules is the major thing that we're getting out of, but most students make rules out of the practice. Oh, you're supposed to watch the breath all the time. Oh, you're supposed to be mindful all the time. No, we can't do that. But when we can wake up to recognize that we're in Dukkha, When we see the dissatisfaction, then we can do something about it. We can wake up and take care of the dissatisfaction. So we have to gain skills in seeing the dissatisfaction because often we're in a state of dissatisfaction and we don't know it. Typical example is the two guys are in the bar, they're arguing over their sport team, and everybody else in the bar can see these guys are hot and heavy at each other, but you ask them, and no, no, they're not angry. It's very hard for us to see ourselves. This is one of the reasons why Sangha is so valuable, is because we have our noble friends who, by their very behavior, can help us point out our own behavior, rather than us staying ignorant about it. So this is why we don't want to eat just the food that we like. Nor in your case are we supposed to eat the food that we're supposed to eat, but rather think of, no, we're going to sample stuff. And so when you're laying in bed with the thought, I'm trying to go to sleep, I should go to sleep, I need to go to sleep, if you can see that thought is unwholesome, because that thought, that's the thought basically, and one and a few others that are keeping you awake.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so we can say, "Oh, I can just lay here and just rest." Take a deep breath, and the point that you made about the body, yes, that's the time to wake up. When the body tells you, "You need to take a breath," it's almost always a really wholesome, healthy breath that we take, a big, deep in-breath, and we enjoy it too. Yeah. Okay, this is— this is— so when you're doing that, you're practicing correctly. But if the body needs air, and instead of taking a nice, easy, deep breath and relieving the body, we have the thought, darn it, I haven't been watching my breath. What kind of meditator am I? I mean, I'm getting really tired of this stuff. Okay, all of those are unwholesome thoughts that are not helping the body. They're not helping feelings of rest. There is— we work ourselves up over that issue of all the time. So please forget about yourself doing it all the time and start enjoying it when you do remember, because there are going to be all kinds of anchors that are going to help you remember. An example is the body is going to tell you when it needs a nice long deep breath, like at the end of a sentence when you talk. Uh-huh. Everybody takes a nice long deep breath after they talk. Either that or they get really hoarse and whispery when they keep trying to talk on and on and on and never take a breath and never take a breath. They just keep talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking. Until I run out of breath altogether and I can't take a breath yet, I still have things to say. Wow, that was a big deep breath. Okay, so every time that we make a sentence or laying in bed or anything like that, what's really going on is that the body has rang your bell. It's made you conscious. I need a deep breath. And the right thing to do is say, oh boy, hot dog, I love this body, I'm going to give it a nice nurturing deep breath. But what the average blow job does is he says, darn it, I haven't been watching my breath, that's why I need another breath, all this Anapanasati stuff is so hard. And it all has to do, the major problem is all the time. Well, we could stop that all the time stuff and start enjoying it whenever.

**Speaker B:** In fact, in fact, when I do this, I am watching it. I am watching it all the time because I'm watching, I'm watching the sensations of letting the breath go and just sort of looking for, I suppose, looking for the point where it stops and the next cycle starts.

**Speaker A:** When it— what is the V? What is it? I missed your point. You said something stops and I didn't catch what. Yeah, you said it. You just said it.

**Speaker B:** You're looking for the point, or I am looking for the point where effectively the out-breath stops and the point comes where the body wants to start taking it in.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And that is the point where you, in fact, I mean, what I'm what I'm doing, and this is, yeah, I take a long deep breath, I let it out. In fact, I probably, I give up on trying to let it out regularly and gently all the way and slowly. I just let it go and let it go and let it go.

**Speaker A:** When you say let it go, that means an out-breath.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's right. I mean, it means an out-breath. There comes a point where nothing much is happening, and then I feel myself pushing with the lower abdomen the breath until there's effectively— it feels like there's nothing in there at all. And that is the point at which the breath starts to take the The.

**Speaker A:** Body demands a breath. The body demands a breath.

**Speaker B:** Precisely.

**Speaker A:** Why can't you see it? Okay, so here's the subtlety. You're going way into the point that the body is demanding a breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why can't you wait? Why can't you see before the body demands it when the body is merely asking for a breath? Can you see it even sooner than that? Okay, here's the point, is that you still are trying to go to extremes, thinking that there is some value in doing things in extremes, like waiting for the body to go all the way out of breath before you take a deep breath.

**Speaker B:** But actually, it enhances the deep breath if you do that. It feels better.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay, from time to time, but you don't want to make that an order for you to do that all the time?

**Speaker B:** No, well, no, I suppose not. I mean, that's me watching my breath. Yeah, the— no, I do find that if I let it go and push the last out, then the inhale is better. The inhale is deeper and stronger and more, if anything, pleasant.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what's the advantage of doing that all the time? All the time, every breath, every breath, all the time.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't actually work like that.

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't. So start giving yourself a break, give yourself a rest, and to do that only occasionally. You don't have to do that all the time. You can do it when it feels good, when you like it, when you can remember And you don't have to push it all the way out. That in fact, here's the thing: let's talk about a gasoline-powered truck. I have seen, because I lived in the South, I have seen guys fill up their tank, especially at one of the really cheap gas stations, and they will get up on their bumper or on the back of the car and jump up and down to try to get the last little bit of air out of their gas tank so that they can— and they wind up spending, putting maybe half a gallon or so gas right there on the pavement because they're trying to get it all the way full. Those same guys will then pass by another station getting the last drop of gas out of their car till they finally— it stops on the road because it's run out of gas. It would be much better to more on a, let us say, more regular basis to just fill it up and just go and get gas when it's getting a little bit empty and make it easy on ourselves rather than trying to do all of the filling it up and all the way of the draining it down. That in fact, they say for batteries that it's better to do about an 80%. Don't fill your battery all the way up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so in Anapanasati, the way that I would recommend it, and I've said this many times, you might have not heard these, is that most people breathe at a level, a percentage, is they don't let all the oxygen out at all and they don't take it in all. That in fact, what they're doing is about a 40 to 60, maybe a 35 to 65 range. And with that, they don't throw all of the other stuff out. So occasionally it's good to empty, but you don't have to empty with every breath. Just empty it out occasionally. And also you don't need to fill it up all the way, not every breath. That in fact, it would be better to start mindfully breathing at about an 80/20, 80/20, so that you fill up at about 80% and then let it go at about 20%, getting into the habit of doing that and training the body, and then the body will do that kind of automatically so that you're getting enough air. But a lot of people don't get much air. They go very, very gently, and that they don't breathe in very much, and then they don't breathe out very much. And so their lungs are neither ever full, which means a lot of the stuff in the lungs, the bacilli, never get any job to do, while the ones at the bottom are so laden with crap that didn't get breathed out and didn't get breathed out. So occasionally emptying it all the way out and occasionally filling it all the way up is a very good idea. One of the ways that you can tell that, by the way, is with the shoulders rising. And what do I mean by that? The shoulders are rising and falling because that's the last part of the breath. Once you fill the bottom, and then the middle. Eventually it builds up to the top, and that's when the shoulders will start to rise. But you don't want them to really rise and rise and rise because you're completely full of air, but rather just let them rise a little and then start to fall. So let me show you the example while you're watching me. Not breathing all the way out and not breathing all the way in, but breathing more than we would normally breathe. And if I forget about doing that, I've already built up the oxygen level in my blood when I did do that, so I can have a few breaths where I'm not thinking about doing that, and that's fine. But a few minutes later, I'll think about But I do that on the calls with students, that I'll talk and talk, and when they talk, I'll sit and I'll take a deep breath and let it out. But I do it without having a set of rules. There's no standards, there's no set of rules for doing this. It always has to do with.

**Speaker B:** Um.

**Speaker A:** Doing it wholesomely in this present moment. But we also go to experiment. We want to find where the Dukkha is so that we can see it and avoid it. And so the kind of thoughts like, "I must get to sleep," or, "I should do Anapanasati breath every breath, I got to do it all the time," these are actually unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Thoughts.

**Speaker A:** And part of that has to do with wanting to get something out of it. We're still trying to make progress. And the right way to do it is to recognize that you've already arrived to this present moment. The only destination that is ever important is this present moment. We finally got here. And so now we can rest and take a deep breath. But most meditators are wanting something. They're wanting a Jhana, they're wanting removal of suffering, they're wanting Nibbana, they're wanting enlightenment, they're wanting Sotapanna, they're wanting this, that, and the other thing. And so they're working at it. And what the teaching actually is, is to stop working and relax and enjoy the fact that you have just arrived. At the destination of here and now. And it makes it very easy then. The practice is actually very easy because we're practicing arriving and enjoying the fact that we've arrived. But most people are not practicing arriving, they're practicing being on the way, they're practicing being on a journey. Like, I've got to get to sleep, or I've got to get Jhana, or I've got to watch every breath. This is all travel-oriented. I've got to, I've got to, I've got to do this. And we can change that mentality into, oh wow, this is so nice, this is good, I've arrived. Like cheesecake, thinking about cheesecake, wanting cheesecake, that's a lot of work. Now I got to go get cheesecake. But if I got cheesecake in my mouth, oh, I can have a feeling of, oh, this is so nice. Oh, I like that taste. This is really good. And it's all a mind state. So the next time that you're laying down, just enjoy laying down. And the next time you take a breath, just enjoy this breath.

**Speaker B:** Well, as you talk, in fact, that is what I'm doing, but I do still find myself pushing out precisely because it's enjoyable pushing out.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you like doing it, then that's okay. Some people enjoy running the 100-yard dash.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've never understood that one. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Some people enjoy lifting 200 kilograms.

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, you—.

**Speaker A:** And so I'm not trying to take away your enjoyment. But instead, I'm showing you that you can take the work out of it to where it is enjoyable, rather than, "I did it because I want to enjoy it, but it's not good enough yet. I got to work again to get it, and then I'll enjoy it." Always the postponement of gratification, rather than just being in that state of gratified right now. This is good enough. I'm satisfied right now. Satisfaction. Wow. What a relief.

**Speaker B:** Well, in fact, there is satisfaction. There is satisfaction in getting to the point where it seems like no breath is happening in or out. And that feels, that feels, that feels good. It doesn't last, but it feels good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, enjoy that and continue to remember to just enjoy, to enjoy your breath, to enjoy the body, because you experience, you experience all kinds of things, and then we don't pay much attention to all of that bodily input. For instance, can you feel the wristwatch on your left hand without looking at it? Without looking at it?

**Speaker B:** If I put my mind to it, yes, of course.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. When I mention it, there it is. But those sensations that that watch has been doing have been there all along, and you just weren't paying attention to it. But now that you pay attention to it, put your mind on it, so to speak, you can actually feel that. You can also feel your thumb on your neck if you pay attention to it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, there is a feeling that—.

**Speaker A:** There.

**Speaker B:** Is the feeling that the Piti and the Sukkha are there all the time but have to be found. It's a matter of finding them. Finding something that is there.

**Speaker A:** Although how this— That's a good point. That's a very, very good point, is to find something that's already there.

**Speaker B:** But how does this fit in with Paticcasamuppada, where the Piti is not going to be there unless circumstances unless the process goes through to produce it. It can't be there all the time because nothing is there all the time.

**Speaker A:** Nothing is there all the time, right? Okay, so here's the first part. Is the teaching of Paticcasamuppada just a detailed version of the Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering? It starts in ignorance, right? Dead in the middle is the feelings. Of liking and not liking, and at the end is the Dukkha. The Dukkha is caused by ignorant feelings. What do we mean by ignorant? That means we're not paying attention. Now, I'm not saying that that watch is causing you Dukkha, but it could possibly start scratching your arm and put a dent in it or make some damage for your arm, and you weren't paying much attention to it. And so the watch itself is causing an irritation, but the real irritation is that you weren't watching the irritation. You were ignorant of the irritation, and yet you could start getting irritated at other people when in fact the irritation was coming from the watch. This is what we mean by Paticcasamuppada, is how do we wind up irritated? How do we wind up being dissatisfied. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has a major point with this, and that is that if we have wisdom at the point of contact, when that watch contacts your skin, are you aware of it? Or are you ignorant of it?

**Speaker B:** Well, I need to be ignorant of it, in fact, most of the time, because it isn't It isn't particularly comfortable when I do watch it because it's sort of sticky. It's sort of sticky. It's sticking onto the wrist.

**Speaker A:** Aha. Well, let's go down that a little bit then. Why do you wear the watch? If it in fact causes a bit of discomfort, why do you wear it? Another way of thinking about it, why don't you put it away for a day or two and see what it's like without it? For one thing, here's something about wristwatches, and we're not talking about cell phone watches, we're talking our timepieces, clocks and whatnot in the cell phone, but we're actually talking about the wristwatch because they're very famous, especially for older people. Okay, if you have a wristwatch, then it's easy for you to tell the time. The wristwatch will tell you, and the wristwatch will probably be more accurate. But when we go to the Wat, we don't wear the wristwatch because nobody there wears a wristwatch, which means the time is not so important. The wristwatch is there to remind us that time is important. The old phrase is, "Time is money, look at the clock." And sometimes the joke is, "Time is money, look in the clock," because the actual money is in this grandfather clock.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But the point is that you can learn to tell time better by not having a watch. Because then we start relying upon the reality. The time of day is more defined by the sun. So if you know where the sunlight and which direction the shadows are falling and all of that, then you can tell time pretty well. That in fact, our ability to wake up can be increased by not having a watch. And there you have a watch that's on your arm that pulls on the hair of your arm and is somewhat uncomfortable. And so you could begin to ask the question, well, could I do without this watch? I've been wearing this watch for 50 years, or one just like it. Can I do without it for a day or two? And to play with that that in fact you may enjoy not having to wear the wristwatch, not having to wind it, not having to put batteries in it, or whatever it is, because it requires work. And so these are the kind of things that we can begin to look at, that if the watch actually pulls, and therefore pulling on the hair you don't like it, therefore you don't want to be aware of it, then that's a good reason to not wear it. But we can take that into the bedroom again and think about the way that we're laying down on the bed and recognizing that, hey, I don't have to go to sleep. I can just lay here and enjoy. Why do I bring that clock into the bed with me? Why can't I just lay into bed and enjoy being without looking at anything or caring about anything or wanting to go to sleep? I can just enjoy this present moment, be in the destination rather than on the journey.

**Speaker B:** Because actions have consequences, and not sleeping has consequences too.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but thinking about going to sleep has consequences too. And I'm not saying to stay up all night. I'm saying to give yourself a break about how much bad consequences are happening because you can't get to sleep. And instead say, I don't have to go to sleep. I can lay here and enjoy the night. Let me just lay here and enjoy, and I'll be fine tomorrow. I'll be okay tomorrow. Everything is going to work out just fine, and I don't have to pressurize myself. This is the whole idea then for us older guys, is we've got to stop with all of this pressure, all of these rules. You've got, what, 70 years worth of rules? These 21-year-old kids, they don't know how many rules we can pile on over the years. And here you are piling the teaching of the Buddha, Anapanasati, on as a set of new rules to follow.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's rather more than 70 years because it starts very young getting the rules in. And And you get quite— you can get, and one did get, remarkably sort of scrupulous, not so much in keeping them as knowing the ones that you weren't keeping as a child. But there it is, that's not good. Okay. That's interesting about the watch, but it is not— I know it, I've known it's not comfortable particularly, but I've disregarded it since I first had one when I was about 10, I suppose.

**Speaker A:** You've been wearing a watch ever since then? I had a really nice watch. They called it an Accutron. It was really expensive. My mother bought it for me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** As I think a graduation present from high school, or maybe I got it in high school. And I love that watch. And it eventually got broken. But the point was, is that I was, other than my own pride, I was no better with, no better with or without that watch, that it was, it was just a mental attitude. And that when— in fact, I stopped wearing a watch way before I got into Buddhism. I think it was like I had one watch or so after that Accutron got broken, which was when I was in college, and then I stopped wearing— I think it was when I was working for IBM that I quit wearing a watch. But I began when I was a monk, then that's when I began to really figure out that I know what time it is good enough without the watch, that my guess of what time it is is good enough. I don't have to have it exactly right.

**Speaker B:** Oh well, I've seen, I know people that can do that, that have a very good idea of the time without wearing a watch and watching the time, but that's interesting anyway, it's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you can remember that about the watch, you can also remember that about the sleep. So that when you're tired, you rest. And when the body is ready to go to sleep and the mind is ready to go to sleep, that will happen. And the better thing to do is to stop hassling ourselves over doing it. And instead, just enjoy this moment, whether you're about to go to sleep or wide awake in bed.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Yes, rather than telling yourself, you got to go to sleep, you got to go to sleep. Oh no, you don't have to go to sleep. You can get all the rest you need by laying here for the next 30, 40 minutes, or maybe an hour, and then you'll drift off to sleep. But you could spend 4 to 6 hours worrying about, I got to get to sleep, I got to get to sleep, I got to get to sleep, and then replying with ourselves all night long. Instead of just enjoying the night.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, of course, this is.

**Speaker A:** All.

**Speaker B:** Unarguable. I mean, this is what you're saying is absolutely right, but it doesn't work always at the point of contact.

**Speaker A:** Well, all we need to do is remember. And so we had this conversation today. Make a point during the day, at least tonight I'm going to remember to enjoy the night when I go to sleep, when I go to bed. Put that on, put that on your to-do list of when I go to sleep tonight, when I get in bed tonight to go to sleep, I'm going to enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** I tend not to have to-do lists. It doesn't seem to— it doesn't seem actually to work particularly badly, that, because—.

**Speaker A:** Well, the other thing, look at the stuff that you do have on your to-do list. You've got a long to-do list. Why don't we put some wholesome stuff on that to-do list rather than having it clogged up with unwholesome things to do? Like, I gotta get to sleep— that's one of your things on your to-do list. Another one, oh, I've got to get Jhana— that's one of your to-do list things. Oh, I've got to watch every breath— that's on the to-do list. So we can actually examine what are we going to put on our to-do list, put wholesome things on our to-do list and remove the unwholesome things.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Now, this is— now, here is a point that you've reminded me of. I gotta get Jhana, right? When you do get it, when you do get it, I mean, you get pleasant, often overwhelmingly pleasant physical and mental sensations, and then you think, Wait a minute, I mean, aren't we sort of, aren't we going straight into the hindrance of desire here?

**Speaker A:** You know, you're— Actually, no, the hindrance was asking that question. That's correct. Here I am enjoying myself and now I'm going to question the fact that I'm enjoying myself. Oh, isn't enjoying myself a hindrance? We can second-guess 10,000 times.

**Speaker B:** Of course we do, because that's what we're brought up to do.

**Speaker A:** Except that we need to start recognizing that in this case, at least, that's a hindrance. That actually the enjoyment was what we're planning on doing. But you can find ways of turning things around every which way. Oh yeah, they say hindrance, hindrance, hindrance. Oh, you're, you're having Sukkha, that's a hindrance. No, that's not a hindrance. Doubt is a hindrance. Worry is a hindrance. Okay, and here you are worried about enjoyment, that's the hindrance. You're in doubt about, oh, if I go and enjoy this, that's going to be a hindrance. Well, the doubt itself that's the hindrance, not through the enjoyment. The enjoyment is good, the worrying about what the results of it, that's the hindrance that will prevent you from going back into the enjoyment.

**Speaker B:** Then, yes, well, why does the Buddha say that this is the one pleasure? That I allow myself. In other words, all pleasure is bad in some sense.

**Speaker A:** I can allow myself this. No, no, no, that's not true.

**Speaker B:** I mean, pleasure is sinful, and if it costs money, it's even more sinful.

**Speaker A:** Well, that may be the case. But there is a major difference between gaining our pleasures from the outside world. Yes, going to a brothel, getting drunk, watching TV, doing all of that kind of stuff on the outside, looking for pleasure, basically looking for love in all the wrong places, looking for pleasure in all the wrong places. But the Buddha said actually Why am I afraid of the pleasures of the mind? Why am I afraid of the pleasures that come with the first Jhana? And that's when he changed his mind. It's the, let us say, the not yet enlightened Bodhisattva of the Buddha who was asking the kind of questions that you're asking. So now it's time to ask the right question is, well, why are you afraid of pleasure? We're not supposed to have pleasure. We're supposed to work. That's what the boss man— the boss man doesn't want us to have fun. He wants the work out of us. He'll only allow us to have fun if we're productive, we do the job.

**Speaker B:** Can I just ask you, can you point me to the sutta where The Buddha actually says, why am I afraid of pleasure?

**Speaker A:** Sutta number 36 in the Majjhima Nikaya.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, okay, thanks, thanks. I'll, yeah, I think I've read 36. Yes, I think I have, but it hasn't, I haven't, I haven't read anything for, for some time. I mean, I've been thinking, well, you know, what's the point? It's the practice that's the point. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Well, the practice is the point when the practice is practicing wholesome, when the practice is gladdening the mind, when the practice is feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. But often our practice is, I want this and I want that. I'm trying to get this, I'm trying to get that, just like trying to get to sleep.

**Speaker B:** I want to be safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Well, you are safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. Give it a break. You are right now safe, secure, satisfied, and comfortable. Recognize that and say, wow, yeah, that's right, I am. Wow.

**Speaker B:** Well, what I do actually is I tell myself, at least for this breath, I'm safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. Because the shit is going to, you know, I don't know when the shit's going to hit the fan, but it will. Perhaps not in this breath.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps if we can stand aside and not be that fan and let the shit just float on by, then in fact that's back to that point about the sensual pleasures. We're out there looking for the pleasure from the things we see, looking for pleasures from the things that we hear, looking for pleasure from the things that we taste and eat, etc. Like that. And the Buddha is saying that the pleasures of the mind are different. Mm-hmm. Sure, sure. Most people are saying, oh, I want to go get laid. Oh, I want to go get drunk. Oh, I want to go have some drugs. Oh, I want to go meet this. Oh, I want to go buy I want to buy a new car. Oh, I want, I want, I want. And the wanting is not the pleasure. And that generally we don't get the pleasure out of the things that we want. So we make that change. And the change is, is that let me sit here and stop wanting stuff and just appreciate what is right now. Well, that I can be satisfied right now without wanting those sensual pleasures. And as we sit here satisfied, the pleasure starts to mount. This is in fact satisfying. This is good enough. Wow, this is good enough. I can stop fighting. I can stop working. I can stop trying so hard to feel good. And just feel good.

**Speaker B:** Well, that is the process, and that's how it works. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, and then the thoughts come back up again. Never mind, start again. Never mind, start again. Keep building up the wholesome thoughts, and eventually they will outweigh the unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and you can enjoy, you can have a good life. You can lay there in bed and enjoy the heck out of the fact that you're not getting any sleep, and that's all right. Well, sleep is not really what it's cracked up to be after all.

**Speaker B:** Well, you don't know what it's cracked up to be because you're not, you're not aware through it.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm talking about it in the sense of they tell you to take these pills, they tell you you're supposed to have so much, and people who follow the rules exactly don't get much benefit out of all of those rules.

**Speaker B:** No, I don't.

**Speaker A:** And if you would just stop the rules and just say everything's okay right now, I'm good.

**Speaker B:** It seems like every time you open the newspaper, somebody's written an article about how, you know, you have to have so many hours of sleep per day, and if you don't get it, you're going to get Alzheimer's disease, and you name it what you're going to get.

**Speaker A:** But down at the bottom, isn't there something about, please send me money?

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, no. The money comes from the selling of the newspaper in which this stuff is written, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker B:** That's where you're paying. Of course, money makes the world go round, doesn't it?

**Speaker A:** I know, and if we took the money out of it, wouldn't it be nice and relaxed if we didn't have to keep going around and going around? Now, in this regard, we can make the distinction between the planet Earth, which does go around all on its own, and it can do that with or without humans. But when the human says money makes the world go round, what that means is that I'm out there chasing money. That's why I keep going around. The money makes me go around. And if I could sit down and be satisfied and enjoy this moment, then I'm not doing the runaround. I don't have to sleep. I can, I can in fact spend the night just enjoying the heck out of doing nothing much at all, be tired tomorrow and still not have to do anything. That's okay. Take the day off.

**Speaker B:** Well, you can do that, yes, when you're retired, of course, as one does. I mean, it's all days off.

**Speaker A:** Right. Can you in fact retire? Can you? This is what the Buddha allowed with the creation of the Sangha. He allowed people to retire early. As early as the age of 20.

**Speaker B:** Well, I suppose that's— yeah, well, that is also true. But unfortunately, somebody's— somebody's got to work and make the food, keep you lot going, you know. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Let those people who want to do that, who are freaked out when they don't do that, when they are driven to do that, let them do that. Congratulate them for doing that. And you can eat their groceries. They'll share it with you. Yeah, we're not trying to save the whole world. We're only trying to save those who want to get out of the rat race.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And to teach people to take the pressure off of themselves.

**Speaker B:** Yes, you just put me in mind of a very funny program that was produced, television program that was produced in Scotland, essentially about an unemployed layabout called Ramsay Nesbitt. And I found it extremely funny. Saddha, the Anagami. And a lot of people did too. And a lot of people were rather horrified because it's portraying a certain level of Glaswegian society as being like that. And a certain level of any society is like that. But he's leaning, you just put me in mind of the lovely picture of this guy. I think he's, I can't remember if he's just leaning on a broom or something, but he's being made to work. And he's sort of saying, see, these guys are wanting work, let them work. I don't want to work. I don't want to work. You know, just leave me be. Mind you, he got most of his pleasure and his calm, everything else out of drink. So I mean, ultimately he drinks himself into, you know, well, ultimately he is as well as a layabout, he's a drunken layabout and so on. But that line about let those who want to work, work, but I don't want to work and I can get away with it, essentially he's getting away with it. I mean, it wasn't wholesome at all what he's doing, but But there we are.

**Speaker A:** Well, at least he's not digging up the earth, polluting with cobalt and lithiums and all that kind of stuff. At least he's not out there with his chainsaw cutting down trees.

**Speaker B:** This is true. This is true.

**Speaker A:** That don't— doesn't society in fact need layabouts?

**Speaker B:** Uh, well.

**Speaker A:** Especially if the layabout becomes very wise, that during his layabout he actually started watching, he started figuring things out. Okay, here's an example of that would be Eckhart Tolle. Oh yeah, part of his life was that he spent about 2 years sitting on a park bench in London. I imagine that he had to deal with all kinds of bobbies and other people like that telling him, why don't you get up and go get a job? Why don't you go do something? And yet the whole world is much better off because in fact he didn't. He just sat there until he figured out that it was okay to sit there.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think I read one of his books, the impression I got that he was sitting on that branch being extremely unhappy.

**Speaker A:** But he stayed there until he became happy.

**Speaker B:** Sort of thought, sod this, I'm sick of being unhappy. That's about it.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's a question then for you. Aren't you Aren't you sick of being unhappy?

**Speaker B:** Well, I cannot be entirely sick of being unhappy because I think it is probably my duty to be unhappy to some degree.

**Speaker A:** Well, who gave you that job?

**Speaker B:** I wish I knew. I wish I knew because I internalized it a way back. And I've forgotten who put it in in the first place.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's pretty standard. Yeah, it happens at about the same age for everybody, somewhere between the age of 3 and 6. That's just a 3-year period. I mean, you're 70-something years old and we can chase it back down to a particular period, not for just you but for me and everybody else. There's that formative phase and we form. And one of the things you formed was to be responsible enough to suffer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course you are. That's what you're taught to do, and that's why you forget who it was in particular taught it to you.

**Speaker A:** When are you going to start doing this to what you were taught?

**Speaker B:** Uh, oh. Well, because some nameless— well, you will come, as they used to say in Victorian times, you will come to a bad end.

**Speaker A:** That's their promise to you.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay. If you don't do what we're going to tell you, if you don't do what we tell you, you're going to wind up in bad straits. Yeah, okay. This is the situation. Let me explain this to you. We can get into it a little bit deeper, but within psychotherapy, they have the qualities of permission, protection, and potency. Okay, the permission— you don't have that permission. That, in fact, the permissions that you have gotten is to feel bad, feel responsible. You got to toe the work, you got to lift the veil, you got to go go do what you were told to do. You don't have permission to sit down on your butt and enjoy yourself. Of course, the second one, potency, power, is that they tell you, oh, you can't do that, you're not ready, you don't have the resources, etc., like that. How could you possibly sit down and enjoy yourself when all the people you see have to work? They've been told that You've got to work.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Do you have it available? And that's what my job is, Jerry, is to give you the mental state to where you say, I can do this. I can lay in bed and just enjoy it. I don't have to tell myself, you've got to get to sleep. You can just lay there and enjoy it. You can do that. You are powerful enough to remember that you can have fun. So the last one, this is the one that you just mentioned, and that's the protection. Oh, if you lay about, you're going to come to a bad end. If you don't do what you're told, you're going to come to a bad end. And guess what? We have a protection from that built right in. You are protected from having to deal with the consequences of not doing what you were told to do by someone who has already died. The people who told you what you're supposed to do are all dead. The only thing that's left of them is your memories of what you're supposed to do. Not one of them is going to come knocking on your doorstep and say, hey, you're supposed to be asleep right now. Only you do that to yourself. So when you recognize that you did it all from the beginning, that you wrote the rules, you're trying to keep up with the rules, you tell yourself that you can't get out of the rules, and now you're telling yourself that, oh, if I do get out of the rules, I'll have to pay for it. And the answer to that was, is that Eckhart Tolle in fact did get out of his misery that put him on that bench, that in fact he did not have to get nailed to or jailed in that park bench. He wasn't handcuffed to the park bench. Now that you're on the park bench, you can't leave. Oh no. So here's that portion about the protection, is that you can enjoy this moment without having to pay for it later. Yes, that the thought of paying for it later is just an unwholesome thought. Oh, I'll have to pay for this later, and the answer to that is no, I don't. I can enjoy this moment without having to pay for it later, and when that time comes, I'll enjoy that moment too without having to pay later for that one.

**Speaker B:** In fact, what you say, anybody who made the rules for you is now dead.

**Speaker A:** Well, they were all adults and you were a little kid. How many of the people do you know that are over 100 years old that are coming around telling you what to do?

**Speaker B:** Well, I don't, but obviously, but the point is that they are fixed, they are fixed in one's mind. One is conscious all all the time, that one in many ways failed them. One has failed to do what one was supposed to do.

**Speaker A:** Right. And can you come up to the point of saying, "Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah." But the attitude that you've got is the attitude, "Well, I didn't do what I was supposed to do, therefore I'm supposed to feel bad." The result is, I have to feel bad. And the answer is, oh no, you can feel any way you want to feel. You can choose how you want to feel. You do not have to pay for it later, because later you can feel good too.

**Speaker B:** If you choose what you want to feel, you will come to a bad end for sure.

**Speaker A:** Do I look like I've come to a bad end? I love this portion. I'm not leaving. I'd come to a bad end if I went back to the United States and got a job. That would be a bad end.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, sure, sure. They wouldn't give you one. You're too old.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, they would. I can lie about my age. I can put all kinds of stuff on a resume.

**Speaker B:** Well, this is also true. And in fact, when you look at some of the old people having to work, when I remember them in Hong Kong, I mean, hell, You know, old women washing dishes.

**Speaker A:** Not the question is, is though, is she enjoying washing dishes?

**Speaker B:** She didn't look like she— no, she didn't, did she? No.

**Speaker A:** So that's the whole point. Can you stop doing the things that you're doing that cause you misery and suffering and start doing the kinds of things that you enjoy doing and to not have to suffer the consequences for that.

**Speaker B:** I think one would need, one needs an awful lot of convincing that you do not need to suffer the consequences.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, here's how you're going to convince yourself of that. You look in to say, hey, is anybody coming after me because I'm enjoying myself? Well, not right now, never mind. And you keep asking that question and pretty soon you reckon ain't nobody coming after you. The only one that's coming after you is your unwholesome thoughts that somebody's coming after you.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's all those old songs about the devil will pull you under by the— what is it? The tail of your fancy coat or something. You know, all that is culturally indoctrinated into you.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's indoctrinated into people by a certain class of people who are actually intending to exploit them. For instance, daddies always exploit their sons. They want to live their whole life vicariously. To be honest with you, as deep as I went into music, all the way to become a rated musician in the US Navy, going to university and all of that. My dad wanted that. That was me living out his life. And when I recognized I don't have to live out my daddy's life, I can go choose something else. And I did. And he was happy with that. My actual dad, who pushed me into music as hard as he did, was okay that I came back out of it. I didn't have to pay him a dime. For not being the professional tuba player that he wanted to be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And so we can get away with it. We can get away with it. We can enjoy our lives without having to pay hell. That in fact, the hell we pay is the hell we give ourselves. Because nobody cares enough about you to order you around anymore. Only you can do that. And the best thing to do is to order yourself to stop ordering yourself around.

**Speaker B:** Geez, we've been going on for an hour and a half.

**Speaker A:** Have we?

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** I didn't know it was that long, about 18 minutes after the hour. So in any case, I've really enjoyed this. You give me a challenge sometimes. Well, that's okay. I enjoy it. It's not my punishment, it's my joy.

**Speaker B:** Good, good. Well, thank you for that. I am— yes, well, No doubt people will watch it and perhaps they'll learn something, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Oh, absolutely. Yes, I think that this is a valuable lesson. Everybody needs to know that they can have a good life and they don't have to catch hell for it. That's very much a Christian trip. You got to do what we tell you to do, or man, you're going to have to We're going to get you, and if we don't get you, some god's going to get you.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, you're going to burn in hell forever. That's it. It's that simple.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what they say. Guess what? That hell you're burning in is happening right now, and you keep doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And the reality is, let's come out of those hells that we made for ourselves.

**Speaker B:** It all seems a bit too facile, doesn't it? Though it all seems a bit too easy. There must be more in the universe than just sort of, you know, there must be some, there must be a Kamma machine going to get you somewhere.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's the point about that though, is that every time that you start going, you stop yourself because of the possibility of retribution. And the question is, can you get past that and say, it really is okay that I lay here and enjoy myself? To enjoy myself tonight and not have to worry about being tired the next day. If I'm tired, I can handle that, but right now I'm just going to enjoy laying here tonight.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's a good question. One will have to see, see if it works.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go try this out. Go play with it. Enjoy.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, just laying there is enjoyment enough. Other— what's your other choice? Is to complain to yourself about not getting to sleep? They're telling yourself to go to sleep and not going to sleep. That's the kind of hell.

**Speaker B:** Where's the flames?

**Speaker A:** Up here. That's where the hell is. And what— and not only are there flames, but it's smoldering. The Buddha talks about it like that, is we burn all day and then smolder by night. And here we are laying in bed. Oh, I've got to do this tomorrow. Oh, I need to get to rest. I need to go to sleep so I can do blah blah. And the answer is I don't have to worry about what happens tomorrow. I'll take care of that then. Right now I'm just going to enjoy myself and get really rested. And then we stop thinking so much about what needs to be done, and the mind slowly slows down. You can actually, by enjoying the night, you can get to sleep faster than by ordering yourself to go to sleep.

**Speaker B:** Well, I know on the occasion, on the occasions when that works, yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, it works when you remember to do it so that it'll work. That's where we come in with the Sati, is can you remember that you can take it easy tonight? You don't have to pressurize yourself for going to sleep. You can just.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, Jerry. Well, let's go ahead and finish now and you go practice. In fact, why don't you go practice now? It's only what, 9 in the morning for you?

**Speaker B:** 8.

**Speaker A:** 8? Okay. So go lay down in the bed and say, hey, I'm going to enjoy myself for a while.

**Speaker B:** Let me. That was what I was intending to do. I mean, what I was intending to do. To do when I was awake at 4-something is get on the call to you and then go back to bed. But, um, in fact, I mean, I didn't, I didn't actually do it that way.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, never mind, never mind, just start again. Everything is okay right now. It didn't matter what happened 4 hours ago. Right now everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, yeah. Well, thanks for all that, and I hope it's not made your bottom too sore, your hip too sore sitting on the ground.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I'm going to go take a rest myself.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Cheers then, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching from Dhammarato (Speaker A) centers on **replacing striving and rules with relaxation, acceptance, and finding satisfaction in the present moment.** Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Stop Striving, Start Arriving**
The practice is not about achieving a future state (like sleep, jhana, or perfect meditation), but about recognizing you have already "arrived" in the present moment and learning to rest there.

### **Main Teachings:**

1.  **Reframing Anxiety & Tiredness:**
    *   Feelings like anxiety (e.g., tightness from adrenaline) or tiredness are natural bodily signals, not enemies.
    *   Suffering arises from our **aversion** to them ("I don't like this, I must get rid of it"). This very aversion and struggle can perpetuate the feeling (e.g., wanting anxiety to go away creates more anxious thoughts).
    *   The wise response is to **change your relationship** to the feeling: recognize it, understand it's okay to feel it right now, and make a gentle physical or mental adjustment (change posture, take a walk, change your thoughts).

2.  **The "Sleep Problem" as a Prime Example:**
    *   Insomnia is often caused by the unwholesome thought **"I must get to sleep."** This creates pressure and mental activity, which is the opposite of rest.
    *   The solution is to **drop the demand for sleep** and replace it with: **"I don't have to sleep. I can just rest here and enjoy this moment of being in bed."**
    *   This shift from striving to accepting allows the mind and body to naturally relax into sleep.

3.  **Reinterpreting Ānāpānasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):**
    *   It is **not** primarily about intense, unbroken concentration on the breath. That approach is seen as rigid, "Western," and rule-bound.
    *   The **spirit** of Ānāpānasati is to **gladden the mind, relax the body, and cultivate wholesome thoughts.**
    *   The breath is a useful **anchor**, but the practice includes enjoying bodily comfort, feeling satisfied, and letting go of wanting things to be different. You can practice this in any posture, at any time.

4.  **Letting Go of Internalized Rules & "The Major Enemy":**
    *   The "major enemy" is the idea that you must do something **"all the time"** (e.g., watch the breath perfectly, be constantly mindful). This creates self-criticism and struggle.
    *   Dhammarato encourages **sampling** the practice playfully—doing what feels wholesome and enjoyable in the moment, not following a strict internalized rulebook.
    *   These rules often come from childhood conditioning (to be responsible, to suffer, to work). The talk encourages questioning this internal "boss" and giving yourself **permission** to be at ease.

5.  **Pleasure is Not the Enemy:**
    *   In response to a question about jhana being a hindrance, Dhammarato clarifies that **wholesome pleasure and satisfaction (sukha) from the mind are not hindrances.**
    *   The hindrance is the **doubt and worry** about whether enjoying oneself is allowed. The Buddha's path includes cultivating joy and contentment free from sensual craving.

6.  **The Role of Practice:**
    *   Practice is the moment-to-moment **remembering (sati)** to drop unwholesome thoughts (like "I must sleep" or "I'm failing") and replace them with wholesome ones ("This is okay," "I am safe and comfortable right now").
    *   It's about building a habit of **arriving in the present** and **ceasing the inner struggle.**

### **Key Metaphors & Phrases:**
*   **"Stop traveling, you've arrived":** The goal is the present moment.
*   **"Letter of the law vs. spirit of the law":** Don't get lost in strict meditation techniques; aim for the spirit of gladdening the mind and relaxing.
*   **"The gasoline truck":** Don't strain to get the "last drop" out of every breath (or experience); ease and regularity are better.
*   **"Permission, Protection, Potency":** A framework to overcome the inner voice that says you're not allowed to be at ease, you'll be punished for it, or you're not capable of it.

**In essence,** the talk is a guide to **reducing dukkha (suffering/stress) by relinquishing the control of deeply ingrained, striving habits and learning to rest in—and even enjoy—the simplicity of the present moment.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about anxiety, meditation, sleep, and the mind. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Adrenaline as a Biological Tool:** Anxiety (tightness in the chest from adrenaline) is compared to a useful biological function, like the adrenaline needed to escape a dangerous gorilla. The problem is applying this tool in inappropriate, non-life-threatening situations.
2.  **Faulty AI Feedback Loop:** The cycle of anxiety is compared to a poorly programmed AI (like a Google speech tool) that gets things backwards: the thought "I want anxiety to go away" is misinterpreted as a need for more adrenaline, thus creating more anxiety.
3.  **Meditation: Letter vs. Spirit of the Law:** Formal meditation practice is compared to following the "letter of the law"—rigid rules about posture, breath-watching, and duration. The advocated approach is the "spirit of the law"—focusing on key principles like gladdening the mind and relaxing, regardless of form.
4.  **The Mind as a Gas Tank (or Battery):** Breathing is compared to fueling a car or charging a battery. You don't need to completely empty or fill the tank with every breath. It's better to operate in a moderate range (e.g., 80/20) for ease and efficiency, only occasionally taking a very deep or complete breath.
    *   A related story is told of people in the South jumping on their car bumpers to get every last drop of gas into the tank, often spilling it—illustrating the futility and mess of always trying to be at an extreme.
5.  **The Destination vs. The Journey:** The common striving in meditation (for Jhana, enlightenment, sleep) is compared to being perpetually "on a journey." True practice is compared to "arriving at the destination" of the present moment and enjoying it.
6.  **Cheesecake:** The mental state of wanting cheesecake (striving, desire) is contrasted with the state of having cheesecake in your mouth (satisfaction, enjoyment in the present).
7.  **The Watch as a Symbol of Pressure:** The physical wristwatch is used as a metaphor for societal pressure, rules, and the constant tracking of time. Removing it symbolizes letting go of internal and external pressures to perform or adhere to schedules (like mandatory 8 hours of sleep).
8.  **Internalized Rules as Dead Taskmasters:** The internal voice that says "you must" or "you should" is compared to the voices of authority figures from childhood who are now dead. The suffering is self-inflicted by keeping their rules alive in one's own mind.
9.  **Burning and Smoldering:** The Buddha's description of suffering is referenced: we "burn" all day with desire and aversion, and then "smolder" all night with worry and restless thoughts—creating our own hell.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Insomniac's Cycle:** A detailed story is woven throughout about a person lying in bed, telling themselves "I must sleep," becoming frustrated, and thus activating the mind and body in a way prevents sleep. This is contrasted with the story of shifting attitude to "I can just rest and enjoy this moment," which naturally leads to sleep.
2.  **The Pharmaceutical Industry Narrative:** A story is implied about how society, driven by profit (pharmaceutical companies), creates and sells the "rule" that everyone needs 8 hours of sleep, leading people to medicate themselves unnecessarily.
3.  **Eckhart Tolle on the Park Bench:** Referenced as a modern example of someone who, by choosing to be a "layabout" and sit on a bench for years despite social pressure, eventually found profound peace and wisdom.
4.  **The Scottish TV Character (Ramsay Nesbitt):** Speaker B references a fictional "drunken layabout" who embodies the attitude of "let those who want to work, work," albeit in an unwholesome way. This story is used to spark a discussion about the value of non-striving.
5.  **The Father and the Tuba:** Speaker A shares a personal story about how his father pushed him into a music career (to live vicariously through him), and how he was able to step away from that path without the catastrophic consequences he feared.

**Overall Theme of the Metaphors and Stories:** They consistently aim to dismantle rigid, striving, goal-oriented approaches to mental well-being and meditation. They advocate instead for ease, relaxation, enjoyment of the present, and a shift from following external "rules" to understanding internal "spirit."
