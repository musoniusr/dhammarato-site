### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Unity. Does anybody see the call starting yet? I don't see it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I see that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's recording.

**Speaker A:** All right, good. So welcome to Saturday afternoon Thailand time. The UK, which is mostly for in the morning. And I have a question for you guys, and maybe we can put this as a topic to talk about. Is this the right time? I mean, we've been doing it at this time of day for 2 years, and we can do it later in the day, that I could actually do it, say, at 4 instead of 4. We could do it at 8. Would 4 hours from now be better for you?

**Speaker D:** Personally, me, no.

**Speaker A:** But.

**Speaker B:** No, personally, this is also a good time for me.

**Speaker A:** This is good time. Okay. All right. So the question has come up that was actually two different questions, and that is the issue of unity versus duality. And so we can start talking about that first. Now, one of the ways that we can think of it in the sense of duality is the human mind is in a mess. The human mind is a crowd. The human mind has dialogues with itself, taking on different roles and different functions. And that there's a great deal of what the Buddha teaches about The term Samadhi mind is often very much confused, because what it actually means is the unification of the mind, where you become whole, you're one person. You're no longer a crowd, you're not dual. Now where the duality would come in, psychologists know about it and talk about it in the sense of the superego state versus the id. That's in Freudian psychology. In the teachings of the Buddha, we can think of it as our attachments to rights, rules, and rituals, and how things are supposed to be versus how we feel about things, because almost always there's a conflict. An example of that is the woman looks in the mirror and the old law comes up that she got from her mother, "Thou shalt not be fat." Now, the very clear and obvious thing is, is there she is looking in the mirror and she's fat. Being fat is not a problem. Having a rule, "Thou shalt not be fat," is why the woman feels bad, is because she's not living up to her own standards. How many times do you say you ought to do this and then don't do it and feel bad? What, 10 times a day? 30 times a day? How about getting ready for this call? Oh, I don't want to do it. Oh yes, I do. Oh, I should do the call. And so we go through that with that kind of dialogue that keeps us in conflict with each other. I mean, within our own mind. And when we can see that, those times that we can see that, we can do something about it. At those times that we don't see it because we're not looking, we can't do anything about it because we don't see that we're divided. We don't see that we're actually having an argument and a conflict within our mind because we argue with other people so much. That we begin to argue with ourselves. Is it this, is it that? I'm right here, you're right there, and that kind of stuff back and forth. Oh, my boss told me you can't do that, and I'm saying I paid for it and I want it. So this is the kind of dialogue that we get into, back and forth, up and down, and all of those rules are stored in the superego, and Eric Byrne calls that the parent ego state. And the reason for that is quite logical in the sense that where do we get all of our rules? We get it while we're being parented. Not just mom and dad, those are not the only two parents that we have. In fact, you can make the little change from parent to parrot and get closer to it, because that's what a parrot does. A parrot doesn't understand anything he says, he just knows the words, he knows the sounds. And that's what we do to ourselves. We don't really understand the rules that we made for ourselves, but we recite those rules to ourselves anyway, and then we feel bad. And that's one of the main dualities that we have. But there's other dualities. A very, very closely related one is, "Thou shalt not get caught." It's okay to sin, it's okay to do wrong, but just don't get caught. And if you do get caught, deny it. And if you catch yourself, deny it. This is why we talk about it as people are in a sense of denial, is because they don't want to look at their wrongdoing, is because they're not supposed to do any wrongdoing. Rather than using the wrongdoing that we do do as a tool to see clearly, to look at that thing, and to recognize that it is Dukkha-bound. But when we deny it, we're adding extra Dukkha. Now we've got double Dukkha. One is that we did something wrong, we created Dukkha, we're causing ourselves or someone else trouble, and now we're lying about it. We're in denial. This is a major, major point along the path that the Buddha talks about in one of the suttas. Number 48, by the way, is the best place where he's talking about the way that the Paticcasamuppada, which is what they do at some watts every 2 weeks and otherwise they do once a month, but it has an opportunity for the monk to do a confessional, to get it off of his chest, to admit to himself that he has done wrong And if we admit to ourselves that we've done wrong, to our main teacher, to the abbot, or to someone high that we highly respect, and he gives us a pat on the back and says, "That's good that you admitted to that," then we begin to learn to be honest with ourselves. We don't lie to ourselves so much. We don't overinflate to try to get out of, "Oh, I screwed this up, so I got to be really good at this over here." —because that's another kind of Dukkha that we add. "Oh, I've got to pay for my wrongdoing even though I'm denying it. Somehow or another I still got to pay back." And so we have all of these dualities that we have in the mind. Another kind of duality is doubt, doubt itself. Is it this or is it that? 'Oh, I've got to know,' which is another rule that we put on there. 'Oh, I've got to know, therefore it's not good for me to be in doubt.' That's one of the reasons why Ajahn Po, when he followed me around, he'd come up and whisper in my ear, 'Not sure.' You don't have to be in doubt about it. If you don't know, you don't know, and that's okay. You don't have to be sure about anything. In fact, if we're sure about something, we'll often miss the because we're no longer looking, we've already decided that we know it. But if we keep the mentality of, "I'm not sure, and I'll figure it out because I'm looking," that gives us confidence, and that confidence begins to bring the mind back out of its dualities into unification. So the various qualities then is doubt, telling ourselves lies, denying our wrongdoing, having wrongdoing— because there's two kinds of wrongdoings. One kind of wrongdoing is that which creates Dukkha right there in the reality of the situation. The other kind of wrongdoing is the rules: "You're not supposed to do that." That's what we picked up from our parents, is all of the wrongdoing that we're not supposed to do. We'll get caught at it. All right. So that whole idea then is, is that most people live by a set of rules. They've got standards, you know, they got dress codes and they've got diet standards and they've got alcohol standards and they've got smoking standards and they've got work standards. All over the place. And so everybody then tries to fit into the box that they create for themselves, and the boundaries are all the rules that they create. And every time they bump into one of the rules, they feel bad. This is what keeps us in that duality state, is what's inside the box, because the duality here is the inside of the box where we live, and the outside of the box, which is what we don't know And it's okay that we don't know it. So, we can in fact find unification of mind by looking at these things and recognizing, "Oh, I am creating a duality, that I'm making rules for myself," and then I look at the mirror and see that I don't make up to that rule. One rule is that you're really not supposed to get old. Being young is wonderful, and so you go look in the mirror and you say, wait a minute, I'm supposed to be a handsome young man, and all I see is an old fart, and I don't want to see that. Okay, so this is the kind of stuff that we do, and if we can be aware of it, then we've got a choice about it. And the choice basically in all cases is, are we going to choose duality Or are we going to choose unity? And we often do. Now, it's also good to take a moment on the issue of duality versus unity, because it's almost always introduced in a magical sense, high-pollutant sense, way out there magical in pom-pom land. Something that's very far away and hard to attain. But as you know, the teaching of the Buddha is very simple, very in the here-now, that living in a state of duality, hoping that unity and oneness and atonement or at-onement is way off out there someplace— that's what makes it magical, because it's far away when it's magical. Actually, the reality is that it's right here, this moment? Are you in a state of duality, or are you in a state of unity? Most of us spend a lot of time in duality. We were trained that way. That's our parenting. Your parents were in duality, so you're in duality. My parents were in duality, so I was raised in duality. The Buddhist teaching, unification of mind, to get your mind together as a unified whole but that does not mean the absolute end of Dukkha, nor does it mean that it's the absolute end of wrongdoing. That in fact, having the unification of mind is the state that we want to be in so that we can in fact deal with that stuff correctly. That if we're in a state of duality, then it's really hard to see our duality. It's really difficult to see what your house looks like from the street when you're living in the house. And in the house, you don't know what it looks like outside. So we have to get our mind into a state of unity in order to see our duality when it arises, and then we can do something about it and come back into a state of unity, unified mind. And one of the ways that the Buddha plans on attacking that is with the issue of whether this thought is wholesome or unwholesome. That basically unwholesome thoughts are those that create duality, create Dukkha, create that bad feeling when I look in the mirror. Or practicing having noble, high-class, wholesome thoughts. Because wholesome thoughts then bring us back into unity. If you said something good to one person— think of just one person that's out there that you've had to deal with— if you said really nice, wonderful things about that person every time you saw them, then they would become your friend. But if you tell them what a piece of trash is, you may not get a second opportunity to tell them what a piece of trash is. But if you do, every time you meet them, you tell them they're a piece of trash. Is that going to create unity, or is that going to create harmony and unification? Well then, why do we go around trashing ourselves all the time? Because when we're trashing ourselves with these unwholesome thoughts, we're creating duality. And when we're having wholesome thoughts and nurturing thoughts 'Oh yeah, you screwed that up, haha. Never mind, start again. Yeah, you fell down on your faces in the mud. I bet you can get up and dust yourself off and boogie on down the road.' But oh no, when we fall face down in the mud, when we're in the ditch, we start writing the rules about you're not supposed to be in a ditch. And then we'd go for all kinds of duality. So in fact, the way to handle it is to enjoy watching for how you slip into the ditch. The example would be, when little kids are learning to walk, they fall down a lot. And then later, they fall down, but they get back up. And then later, they slip, but they don't fall. What is that slipping about? That's because they're getting better at not falling down. So when we slip, but don't fall, What is that? That's actually quite wholesome, because we caught ourselves. Haha, I slipped! And pretty soon we do a whole lot of slipping, but we never fall. We never fall right into the Dukkha. Why? Because the slipping that happens is enough to wake us up, so we make a maneuver, make a sidestep, come out of the unwholesome. And in this case, that slip means that you're actually now going to put your foot in a place that has a solid landing. And if you can find that solid landing, you won't fall. You slipped, but then you caught it, and you're able to maintain your balance. So that's one of the reasons why I use that analogy, is because that's exactly what happens in the mind. And that slipping would be like one unwholesome thought. Yeah, we're wholesome and wholesome and wholesome and la-de-da, and everything is beautiful, and then I think about my mother. And off I slip, but I don't fall into it. I can say, hey, I don't have to think about my mom right now. She's been dead for 5 years. Let me be here now. Let me not go back into the past. Let me not worry about who got ripped off when, when the funeral happens. Let's just stay in the present moment. And we don't have to fall just because we slipped into an unwholesome thought if you can catch it. This is part of the real training of Anapanasati, is to get into the practice of seeing those unwholesome thoughts just in time of slipping without having to fall into it. And then we can come back out of that. And how do we come out? With the nurturing. For instance, if we slip into fear, now we're going to pull ourselves back out by saying there's nothing around here to be afraid of. There's no Russian mafia, there's no SWAT team, there's no 4-foot-long wasp. There are no cobras, and if I'm a cobra, there's no mongoose. And so we could just come out of our fear because the reality is, is that right now is not dangerous. But we will still slip into fear because we'll be fearful of something that happened in the past. So if we can maintain that point about, oh, I am not going to be afraid right now because there's nothing really to be afraid of, and you get into the habit of being not afraid, then you can go out and actually confront real dangers and still maintain that position of, "I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of it. Yeah, it's dangerous, but even if it bites me, I'll survive, and if I don't, I'll survive not surviving. I'll be okay." And so this is the attitude then, that unification of mind is built upon Srotapanna, confidence, not faith. Faith is when you're face down in the mud saying, "Someday I won't slip." And in fact, you did slip, you did fall. So, this is the way that we're going to have the confidence, is that when we slip, we gain our posture and we don't fall. The reality is, the dancers are good at it. Some of the stuff that makes a dancer so spectacular is that he looks like he's actually slipping, but he catches it. Ballerinas and sports people do it all the time. They slip, but they don't fall. We can learn to do that, too. Because it's the falling that tears everything apart and creates duality, if it's slipping and we can see it, we can come right back. So this is why we're developing Sati, this is why we're developing looking at how we walk, so that when we do slip, we'll know what's going on and can do something about it. Another example of that would be not just fear and becoming fearless, which is the base root of it, but also stop complaining and stop conceptualizing about how things ought to be and could be, and instead accept things the way that they are. This would be called becoming comfortable. We need to practice our Anapanasati in a body posture that's comfortable. So that we can get the mind into a state of comfort. Because right after we get our state of mind as comfortable, now we can proceed into the real point, and that is being satisfied that this is enough. Yeah, there's doubts about all kinds of things. Wow, I am so doubtful. What's going to happen to Putin? What's going to happen to Ukraine? What's going to happen to Trump? What's going to happen to the President? Guess what? I don't know. And that's okay, I don't know, because even if I did know, I couldn't do anything about it. Then in fact, all of those people that are trying to do something about all of those things, they don't know, and they hate not knowing. And so they want to try to go fix it. But the point is, is that there is so much human knowledge that no one person has a chance of even coming up to 1%. There's a lot of stuff that everybody knows, but there's a whole lot of stuff that nobody knows. In fact, there's so much stuff that nobody knows, we don't even know how much nobody knows. And look how many people fret over that. I mean, look how many labs they have for chemistry, and look how many telescopes, and look how many— all of this got in the other thing. Look how many websites. All based upon people want to know. They don't like not knowing. They hate that state of being in doubt because why? Doubt tears us apart, makes us uncomfortable. We don't like being in doubt. So how can we fix it so that we become comfortable not knowing? It's okay that I don't know, because if I don't know and I don't care that I don't know, then I can maintain unity of mind. Here's an example, by the way: a yes and no answer to a question. Let us say the question itself requires a yes or a no. How many different answers then can in reality you give? Because you're supposed to only say yes or no, but in fact there are 6 answers. One of them is yes, one of them is no, another one is neither one, something else. Are you Black? Are you White? No, I'm Yellow, something in between. Not gray, multicolored, in fact, rainbow. All right, so in fact, in that regard, there is the third— the fourth answer would be both. It's got all of it together. And then there's the fifth answer, which is the one that I'm getting to, and that one is, I don't know. I don't know whether it's black, I don't know whether it's white, I don't know whether it's both, I don't know if it's neither. And then the kicker on top of that is the reason, by the way, that I don't know is because I don't have any evidence, right? I don't have any evidence. I've been looking and looking and not finding anything, and I'm happy to keep looking, and everything is all right, and I still don't know. But because I don't know and I haven't seen any evidence, that means that whatever it is—black or white or gray or in between or both or neither—doesn't matter, because everything is hunky-dory. And so the sixth answer is: I don't care. Yes, no, both, neither, I don't know, and I don't care. Now, yes and no is duality. Both is unity. Neither is duality. I don't know can be either one. I don't know in this unity I don't know on this, but I don't care is 100% unification. I don't care. So if you don't care about politics, and you don't care about which is the fast automobile, and you don't care who wins what sport, and you don't care what's on television, you don't care what politics is, and you just don't care about any of that stuff, you're coming pretty close to having unification of mind. Now, getting back to that, coming out of the reality of it back into the magic, one of the things, Amrit, that you mentioned on this was no thought, right? How is no thought, or not thinking at all, or having a blank or an empty mind How is that unification of mind? Hello, guest user, welcome. So anyway, Amrit, do you have an answer to that?

**Speaker B:** I think this would be the sixth point you mentioned, right? So if you are not thinking, then you don't care.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a good answer. I like that. Congratulations. Normally, however, the empty mind only comes about when we do get into that 'I don't know' and 'I don't care' position. Now, that 'I don't know' and 'I don't care' position is unlike 'I gotta know' and it's either yes or no. That duality then, when we come out of that, that's like coming out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. With the wholesome thought is, "I don't know and I don't care." So if we have that point then, of "I don't know and I don't care," that means that our thoughts are all wholesome. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought, right? I don't know and I don't care, and everything is hunky-dory and I'm all right. I don't have to go anywhere or do anything because I don't know what to do and I don't care if it gets gone or not. So there it is. Now, if we, um, are— let's just do this. There is a sutta. The sutta is number 19, and by the way, the name of the sutta is Two Kinds of Thought. What kind of thoughts are there? Unwholesome thoughts and wholesome thoughts. And that the first part of the sutta, the Buddha goes into great deal about what are unwholesome thoughts, including thoughts of revenge, thoughts about getting back, thoughts about getting even. Thoughts about winning something over someone else, thoughts about getting something we want, thoughts about getting rid of things that we want to get rid of, all of that kind of stuff is unwholesome. And then the wholesome thoughts would be, "I don't know and I don't care." So the sutta also then ends, or has in the middle of it, a part about a story about a cowherd. The cowherd, actually not like the cattle drives that they had in the West where they have thousands of cows, but this was an Indian dude. He's got a stick and he's got 5 or 6 or maybe half a dozen cows. And he gets up in the morning, he takes the cows out to have them graze. But along the way, he passes through an inhabited area along the path. And that's why he's got the stick. So if one of the cows tries to eat a carrot off of one of the sales tables, he can whack that cow. If the cow gets wrapped up in the laundry, he'll whack that cow before it does. If he sees the cow about to step on a child, he'll whack that cow. He will not let those cows run amok in that village, because the village people will take his cows away from him in payment for the damage they've done. So after he gets through the village though, with his cows safely intact, he takes them out to the field where there's stubble, like rice stubbles and things like that, to give the cows to eat. While the cows are eating, guess where their heads are? Are their heads in the sky, or is the cow looking around for carrots and stuff, or does he have his head down munching? So if the cows are out there in the field munching What is the cattleman and his stick? He's got no reason for the stick, and he's got no reason to sit there with the cows. So this is the analogy then for the first Jhana. And that is, is that while we are parading our cows through the village of our own mind, by the way, we have to whack that cow, whack that thought. Aha, I caught you! Whack! Get back in line. Stop out of all that unwholesome work and get back into having a wholesome thought. You're in the village now, either in the village in reality out in this town with all of those people out there, or you're in the village of your own mind. But you got to watch those thoughts. You got to watch those cows because those cows, those thoughts will go anywhere and cause all kinds of damage. So we watch where they're going and we put the mind in the state of having one wholesome thought after another, just like the cows will take one wholesome step after another until they get to the pasture. Once they're in the pasture, Now the cowherd can really rest. He doesn't have to keep the cows in line, one wholesome thought after another. He goes and sits under the tree. That's the same as the analogy for going into second jhana, because in first jhana we're capable of keeping one wholesome thought after another. The mind is free from hindrances, and we apply and sustain the mind to keep it in the state of Sukkha. And occasionally some Piti. "Wow, I got through that village with all those cows." He left. So, if we can get into that second Jhana, that's the place where there is no thought. But let me tell you something, that state is not a practical state. He can't sit under that tree because the cows are going to stop grazing and they're going to wander away. You cannot sit behind the wheel of an automobile. It would be great if you could sit behind the automobile and drive and keep your eye on the road, keep your mind focused on what you're doing, watch what you're doing. But going into second Jhana is almost like closing your eyes, and now you're out of control of that car completely. It can go anywhere. That's why we want to spend so much time in first Jhana. Is to get the mind trained for the fallback after we come out of the second jhana from thoughtless into thought, is that we're back into wholesome thought. So the second jhana is quite dangerous and nobody lives their life in second jhana. That's why the Buddha in Sutta 36 makes a particular point that enlightenment, the path to enlightenment, is through and in the first jhana. And yet all of these Westerners want all of this high goal of, oh, you're supposed to get into no-mind. Well, in fact, when you're in first Jhana, you, you know, you can go from one wholesome thought to another. In fact, in the sutta talks about it, that you can start putting some gaps in those unwholesome— in those wholesome thoughts. You can have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought and then put a gap and do nothing. They come back into a wholesome thought. And so the second jhana and all those high jhanas are not what they're cracked up to be, but Western-minded people, they say, "Oh, it's got a higher number," and I know what banks are, they want high numbers, they want big numbers. So we got to have big numbers, that's the rule. And the reality is, is that we can live our lives oh so happily in the first jhana. But we've got to practice and keep that thing there. That's wholesome. And not only that, but it's unification of mind, not thoughtlessness. Thoughtlessness is beyond unification of mind. You don't need thoughtlessness to have unification of mind. That what you need is to have that fearlessness— well, not fearlessness. Fearlessness is basically what an army sergeant does when he is afraid, he goes into battle. What we really need to do is to recognize there's nothing to fear, there's no reason to go into battle, I'm not afraid, got to do nothing. So in fact, fearlessness is a kind of duality. Because it's a bravery on top of fear, two things, to where being safe and secure, that's unification. And so the first Jhana takes us into that unification of mind. Now it goes on from there, because if you in fact can become unified in your own mind, which means that you are not afraid of the mistakes that you made, that you're willing to see them, take a look at them, and learn from them. If we can live our life like that and be at peace with ourselves, be in fact in a nurturing, not a critical mind state, then we're able to make friends with ourselves. We actually do come together, that we don't hate a part of ourselves anymore, that we're friends with all of us. We become unifying. A complete, whole human being, not a perfect human being, but one who's okay. If we can do that, then we can go to the next phase, and that is the unification with other people, that in fact the real duality is me and you, us and them, our tribe and those people. That's the real duality that causes so much trouble. "Oh, them people, they're no good, they wear turbans." "Oh, those people over there, they've got long dresses, they shouldn't be wearing long dresses, they should be wearing kilts." Then somebody else says, "Kilts, that's crazy. Those people ought not be wearing kilts, they should be wearing pants." In fact, under those kilts, they're not even wearing any pants. So it's all about that duality, and that if we cannot become unified within our own mind, then we cannot then become unified in our environment, because we've always got this duality of all those people I don't know and I don't like. But if we can see that everybody's the same, if we can begin to have the thought about, well, it's all the same, There's no difference between me and them, except that I'm happy and they don't know how to be. And so there's the duality, so long as I keep that in my mind: "Oh, I'm better than those people, I'm noble, you know, and those things, they're a bunch of idiots, they're ordinary." In the Pali, the word is puttacana. Ordinary people. There's also words that are like fool or silly person or dumbass. Marga— I forgot the word. But anyway, those words exist, but it depends upon how you feel about it, that you can talk to someone and have great compassion for them rather than having those thoughts about, oh, they should not do that. That if we can take the rules off of ourselves, we can take our rules off of other people also. We can become friends with them. And now our whole life begins to become unified. First we get unified on the inside, and then we get unified on the outside. And if we can ever stop the duality of good and evil, because that's the main one— in fact, that's what all the rules are based around. Is that if I don't like something, then I've got to get rid of it in order to be back in the state of homeostasis, which means that it's bad. Evil, for most people, is based upon what they don't like, and good is based upon what they do like. And a better, more wise way of looking at it is that what I don't like, I should look at my own feelings. Because what I'm looking at and don't like is something that's real. Why should I create duality when there it is? It ain't real. I mean, it's real and I don't like it, but that's all it is. It's not that I say it's bad. I say that I don't like it, and then I can fix it basically by coming to the point is the reason I don't like it is because I don't understand it and I don't know it. And so now I'm in that state of I want to know. And so then the next point is, is that I don't have to know anything about this guy. He's okay already. He does not have to prove himself to me to be okay, just like I don't have to prove to myself in order for me to feel okay. I'm already okay, warts and all. And so all of our friends are warts and all also. And so we stop seeing things as right and wrong, good and bad, or glorious and evil. And this brings us to the story of Adam and Eve. You know that Adam and Eve were tossed out of the Garden of Eden because of their duality, that when they were at unity, if they were at one with the paradise, there it was. But then they ate of the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. There you go. What happens is that if you eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, that means that you have knowledge of that's good, that's bad. That creates the duality right there, and that's what caused Adam and Eve to get thrown out of the Garden of Eden. They destroyed the place. Because they judged it. My little joke is that I live in a paradise here, except for this tree here. I love that tree, except that he gets yellow leaves sometimes, and I don't like yellow leaves. So I'm going to tear this tree up, I'm going to throw it out. But then that palm tree over there, that's got brown, and I don't like the brown on that beautiful tree. It's not beautiful anymore, it's got some brown leaves on it. And in fact, by the time I finish getting rid of all the stuff I don't like, I will have destroyed my paradise. Mhm. But when you see that in fact you live in a paradise, stop judging it. Stop placing that duality of this is good and this is bad, and let everything back to that point of I don't know and I don't care. And if you don't know and you don't care, because it's not dangerous, you live in a paradise. This is what all of that unity is about. All of that duality is about your own mind, about judging things good or bad. And when we stop judging good and bad, everything is hunky-dory. And you don't have to go to the state of, uh, flipping the switch off on your mind so that you have no thought. Better still to have some nice little gaps between one wholesome thought and then a gap and then another wholesome thought and then another gap. So Amit, does that answer your question?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it definitely does. And what's happening, Dhammarato, in the gap when you are making the gap? Bigger and bigger. So then when you are moving into the higher jhanas, if I understand correctly, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. But that's a natural outcome of being able to have all of your thoughts— like all of those cows are now eating grass, they're wholesome— I can take a rest, that I can go to the next level. Because when the mind is busy and agitated and got all this, that's not at rest. And so if we can come down to getting the mind in this state, that's a whole lot more peaceful. That's the first jhana. This is the ordinary mind all over the place. The first jhana, look, it's in sync, it's in unity. And then from there we can go down to— get the point? Second jhana is a natural outcome of well developed first jhana. And yet everybody that I know of in the West saying, oh, second jhana is better than the first jhana, let's go get some second jhana here, folks, let's go get a no-mind, you got to go get a no-mind, rather than understanding that no-mind is the natural outcome of having a wholesome mind. And wanting to have no-mind, they can't do it, they're frustrated. They see maybe the mind stops for a second and they say yeehaw, and then it's because they said yeehaw, it starts back up, and then they don't like that. They They want it to stay quiet. They've got a rule, you know, thou shalt do second Jhana, you've got to quiet your mind. They learned that when they were in diapers, they just applied it, like thou shalt not pee on the floor, and we pick those lines up and now we're applying that same line to thou shalt stay in second Jhana. It's all about the rules that we make for ourselves about how things are supposed to be, rather than having the second Jhana as a natural, beautiful outcome of having that relaxed mind. And this is the state that we want to be in, the state of harmony, not in the state of dead. We want to be in this state. Everything is harmonizing, everything is working together. That's the unification of mind, that's the well-organized machine. It's not full of gunk; the clock of the mind ticks on just fine. So that analogy about the cowherd is a really good one. We have to work at keeping the cows of our mind out of the goods on the path. But we can get to the state of wholesome so that the cows are not— they've got no carrots to play with, they've got no child to run over, they've got no laundry to disturb. All they've got is just the grass. And so the cowherd now can go and rest. So after you get your mind 100% wholesome, one wholesome thought after another after another, Only then can it rest. But all of these Westerners are wanting to sit down under that tree while the cows go amok. And that's why they can't do it, and that's why they put it so far away. But in fact, the unification of mind is right here, right in front of you, self-evident. Stop making dualities by judging things as right or wrong. Bright or dark, black or white. Stop seeing things as black and white and seeing it more likely as I don't know and I don't care. I don't know whether it's black or white or not, and I don't care because it doesn't matter. That it was only a judgment that it's got to be white, and therefore I want white, and therefore I make it white. Look at all that duality in there. 'Or I am Black, I should be Black, I want to be Black, those Whites don't like me being Black.' Look at all the duality in that. But what color? I don't know, and I don't care. And that brings on unification of mind, but it does it one thought at a time. This is not an overall general lifestyle or philosophy. That's what's happening in your mind right now. Is this a wholesome thought? Is this a wholesome thought? Are we having fun yet? Are we satisfied yet? That's the kind of questions to ask, kind of questions that lead you into, yeah, everything's okay. Yeah, I don't know all the answers, but I don't need all the answers. I'm good. So does anybody have any remarks about this? I'm really glad to have talked about this rather than the Brahma-Vaharas, by the way, but it's the same.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think my remark would be that this is, I think, it's just one of the key problems with Western spirituality or the way it's being taught. Because for me, you know, I've been into different practices for God knows 8 years now, and it was not until—.

**Speaker A:** It sounds like a duality.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and it was not until I really understood Anapanasati that I realized the problem, you know. This thing of wanting to get to this state of no thought. And of course, it's kind of logical why people want it, because their mind is so full of garbage that a state of thought is Dukkha for them. And so they try to get rid of it and get the mind quiet. And maybe it succeeds for one second, but then the garbage comes right back.

**Speaker A:** And then they feel that, "Oh, you should not come back, you should not come back," and so they begin to feel bad. This is, by the way, the statement that Goenka makes that is so powerful: "If the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again." But the Western mentality is, "When the mind wanders away from the breath, I'm going to beat your ass. And that's the one that's based upon rules, and that's why it keeps us in duality. But Goenka's remark is, when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. That's unification. So I'm glad to hear that you've gotten it, Marcus. You understand the way that Western Buddhism is taught is actually taught as a duality, even the idea of different meditations. One of the stories about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is, and this happened many, many years ago, probably in the 1930s, because that's when he was the most politically active. He made the statement that the Buddha only taught one kind of meditation. Oh, I see guest has arrived again. Good to see you. So the Buddha taught only one kind of meditation. These guys say, wait a minute, we've got the Vasudhi Marga here that talks about 40 different kinds of meditations. Protested the Vasudhi Marga. That was 1,500 years after the time of the Buddha. And so there was a whole bunch of monks, in fact it was kind of the whole university at the time that was studying Pali, they challenged him on that, they couldn't come up with it. There's not one passage anywhere in any sutta that has a different kind of meditation practice other than Anapanasati, with the possible exception of the charnel ground, but he stopped doing that. Very early in his career. He stopped teaching the charnel ground meditation. What is that? In fact, they say that there's 10 of them, but that's only— if you watch a course, a corpse is going to go through all 10 of those processes. And in the charnel ground, you've got a whole lot of corpses going through a variety of different stages. All the way from livid and bloated, all the way to scattered bones. And it's not necessarily a good meditation. It has some value, but what you're actually coming to the point with is that you're going to die. You're actually going to die. You're going to be one of these corpses. Your body's going to get livid, it's going to start having worms, it's going to get pus. The sinew is going to start rotting off the bones. All that stuff's going to happen. You're going to be nothing but bones, and it's not even you because it's just scattered bones now. Guess what? Can we have the attitude of, oh, being alive is white and being dead is black? There's a duality there. Reality is you don't know what death is going to be like. That's what the real Dharma meditation is, is coming to that posture is I don't know, and I don't care. If you can see your own death like that, you know it's going to happen, then who cares? I've enjoyed it while it's there, but time to check out. Goodbye, folks. But back to that point about, yes, Anapanasati is the only meditation that the Buddha taught. And that whole point about the Anapanasati is to gather up this unification of mind so that you're integrated and you're whole and you're not hard on yourself. And because you're not hard on yourself, you're not hard on other people. You can be really honest and really forceful, you can get your point across, but you do it while you feel good. You make friends with people while you're yelling at them. Just because he screwed up doesn't make him a terrible person. Yeah, he screwed up. I know what that's about. I'm one of the king screw-uppers. The more I do, the more I screw up. And that's okay. In fact, what is screwing up anyway? I don't even know what screwing up is. Maybe it's called screwing up in this regard, and over here it's called learning. So screwing up is bad and learning is good, but it's the same activity? Where's all these rules coming from? Where's all this duality stuff? So this is how we begin to practice, is begin to recognize that we don't know, but we can handle it. I'm not afraid of it. I don't know what it is, but I'm not afraid of it. So does anybody have anything to say now? Anet, what about you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it makes a lot of sense to me, and this is also very practical and very operational, right? So I can make use of it in my practice every day and not some ideal ideas about what is truth and what is, uh, what is self. I mean, a lot of these questions, when I was reading about it, so many of these kind of topics comes up about, you know, whether we are infinite or finite, or there is the whole consciousness is one, or, you know. But, but what you are talking about is something which I can, uh, we.

**Speaker A:** Can just operationalize and You can do this one. It's not complicated. Getting in a state of no-mind, that's hard for people to do when they want it. Yes, but this is easy. The teaching of the Buddha is easy, easy enough if we just practice over and over and over again. And when the mind wanders away from the breath, accept it. That's what minds do, they wander around. Can we bring it back? Just like it's the nature of the cows to eat carrots off of a fruit stand, so you gotta whack them. That's just how it is. You can't hurt— you can't hate the mind because it runs away. You said, I caught you. We'd be very nourishing with ourselves. Everything is okay, everything is fine, everything is beautiful. And that's what brings us into the state of unification. Unification of mind is when we're friends with each other, is when the two halves of you want to merge instead of being it like this. Oh, you should not let the mind wander away. You're a terrible meditator, you let the mind wander away and you were going to get unification of mind. Where is that state of thoughtlessness already? Come on, let's do it. And that's the way that we treat ourselves. We live in a duality because we want things instead of just relaxing and everything's already okay. You already live in a paradise. Or as the Zen say, you're already enlightened, bro. Stop wanting it. You've got it already. So, Kat, do you have anything to say? You were here a minute ago. Yeah, there you go.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say something a few minutes ago about how being in a community or what, or whatever, or even at your workplace is by far the best way to practice being easy on yourself and how that reflects to being easy on others. You're just you just stop caring. Like, it's just— that's just how the outcome is. Just don't care.

**Speaker A:** And yet a lot of people, when they come to the Wat, they come with a whole lot of rules about how things are supposed to be.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and then they leave and look for another one. I have to— I have gone through that like 50 times here, thinking about— because it wasn't a specific way Or I still have that going on sometimes, but I sometimes think there's some.

**Speaker B:** Value.

**Speaker D:** Or validity to some things are just not right sometimes. But it's not a sense of, oh, this is because, or this rule isn't meeting my standards, but it's just like, this could be better, much better. The conditions could be much better. And I mean, I came to the.

**Speaker A:** Wat— Would you be more happy if everything at the Wat would be exactly the way that you wanted it to be? Or would you be spending a whole lot of time trying to make it be the way you wanted it to be? Except, just accept the place the way that it is and it's wonderful then.

**Speaker D:** I don't know what I, what the best kind of Wat would even look like. To be honest.

**Speaker A:** That's right, we don't know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, it can't be perfect because otherwise I would never have to deal with imperfection, and it just doesn't even make sense to have a perfect what. It can't make sense, it will never be perfect.

**Speaker A:** I disagree with you. The what that you're in is already perfect. The duality is that you don't like some of the stuff in there. It's your liking and not liking. You've got rules about how wives are supposed to be. Those mates should keep their pants on. And instead of worrying about that, you can just let the mates deal with their own clothing, thank you very much. They'll do fine. They don't need your judgment. The tree that's shedding the leaves and turning yellow, you use— that's his business, not yours. Yeah, this is what I'm getting at. So this is great. Yeah, so you're getting to the point that the watch already just about good enough, and all you have to do is stop judging it, and then it'll be a paradise. May not be a perfect paradise, but it'll be paradise enough. So you remember that the next time you judge something. You can tell yourself, I wish those mages would keep their pants on. Because you're wishing for things that don't matter. And not only that, but you haven't been in a Taiwad long enough to really understand the Wat anyway. There's a whole lot of dynamics and a whole lot of stuff going on that you don't catch yet.

**Speaker D:** Sometimes I get the sense of wanting to explore other Wats just to go understand the dynamics, because I feel like every— everyone says every temple is completely different in one sense, and I would— you would like to see them, right? Because I just don't know. I just am so curious.

**Speaker A:** You haven't been at the what that you're at long enough to see what the what is. You're still full of judgments about how the what should be. And when you drop that and see how the what really is, the reality of that what, then you can go see some other whats and base it on reality rather than on what Kat likes.

**Speaker D:** That's a pretty good point.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's actually the same point that I make about people who are holding jobs. Don't hate the job and think you got to quit because the job is no good. Go get your own mind straightened out so that you're really happy and satisfied with your life, and then go check out the job to see if the job itself is inherently unwholesome, bad, or whether you brought the unwholesome and bad about the job with you or created it for yourself.

**Speaker D:** That's what I was kind of getting at, like, where's that difference, you know? Like, because maybe I haven't fully seen.

**Speaker A:** I don't know and I don't care. That you keep that in mind. And every time you see something that you don't like, you say, well, I don't really understand what's going on and it doesn't affect me, so I don't care. And pretty soon you'll get into laid-back position about this. Watch it. Paradise is just different from the other paradises. Let me go check that out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Marcus, how about you?

**Speaker C:** I don't know and I don't care.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's leave it there. Guys, this has been a great call. Thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** I hope you enjoyed it. I sure have. This has been a great one. See you later, guys. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), focuses on the practical Buddhist concept of **unity versus duality of mind**, and how to cultivate a unified, peaceful state in daily life.

### **Core Teaching: From Duality to Unity**
The central theme is that our ordinary mind is in a state of **duality**—a conflicted, divided "crowd" of thoughts, rules, and self-criticism. This is contrasted with **unity** (or *samadhi*), a state of wholeness, integration, and peace.

### **Key Points:**

1.  **The Nature of Duality:** Duality arises from internal conflicts, like:
    *   **Rules vs. Reality:** Holding rigid, often unconscious, rules from upbringing (e.g., "I must not be fat," "I must know everything") and feeling bad when reality doesn't match.
    *   **Denial & Doubt:** Denying our mistakes creates "double *dukkha*" (suffering). Similarly, resisting the state of "not knowing" creates agitation.
    *   **Judgment:** Labeling things as good/bad, right/wrong based on personal preference, which fractures our experience.

2.  **The Path to Unity:** Unity is not a distant, magical state but a practical choice available in the present moment.
    *   **Catch the "Slip":** The mind will naturally "slip" into unwholesome, dualistic thoughts (like fear, judgment, craving). The practice is to catch that slip *before* you "fall" fully into suffering and identification with it.
    *   **Cultivate Wholesome Thoughts:** Replace unwholesome thoughts with nurturing, compassionate, and accepting ones. The ultimate wholesome attitude is **"I don't know, and I don't care"** (when appropriate)—releasing the need to judge, control, or know everything.
    *   **The Cowherd Analogy (from Sutta 19):** Our thoughts are like cows. In the "village" (daily life), we must gently guide them (our thoughts) away from trouble (unwholesome objects) with a stick (mindfulness). Once in the peaceful "pasture" (a wholesome mindset), the cows can graze contentedly, and the cowherd (the meditator) can rest. This pasture represents **First Jhana**—a state of unified, sustained wholesome attention, free from hindrances.

3.  **Practical Application & Misconceptions:**
    *   **"No-Mind" is a Natural Outcome, Not a Goal:** Western spirituality often mistakenly seeks "no thought" or "empty mind" (associated with higher jhanas) as a primary goal. Dhammarato stresses that thoughtless states are a **natural result** of a well-established, unified, and wholesome mind (First Jhana). Trying to force a quiet mind while it's still agitated only creates more duality and frustration.
    *   **Start with Self-Unity:** The first step is to make peace with yourself—stop the internal war, accept your mistakes as learning, and be your own friend. This internal unity then naturally extends to others, reducing "us vs. them" thinking.
    *   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) is the Core Practice:** This is presented as the Buddha's primary meditation tool for developing the mindfulness (*sati*) needed to see duality and return to unity. The key attitude is Goenka's phrase: when the mind wanders, **"never mind, start again"**—a nurturing, non-judgmental return.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk demystifies enlightenment and meditation, framing them as the daily, moment-to-moment practice of recognizing dualistic thinking (judgment, rules, denial) and choosing instead a unified mind of acceptance, kindness, and contentment. By doing this, we stop destroying our own "Garden of Eden" with judgments and begin to see the paradise that is already here.

**In essence:** Stop judging, stop fighting yourself, cultivate wholesome thoughts, and unity of mind—and peace—will follow as a natural result.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely a teacher or guide) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the Buddhist concepts of **unity vs. duality** and the path to a unified mind. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors:**

1. **The Mind as a Crowd or Divided Self**
   - **Metaphor**: The ordinary human mind is described as a “crowd” or a place of internal dialogue, conflict, and division—like different voices or roles arguing.
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates the lack of inner unity (duality) and the goal of becoming “one person” through unification (samadhi).

2. **Rules as a Box**
   - **Metaphor**: People live inside a box of their own rules and standards (about appearance, behavior, etc.). The walls are the rules, and every time they “bump into” one, they feel bad.
   - **Purpose**: Shows how self-imposed or inherited rules create inner conflict and duality between “how things are” and “how they should be.”

3. **Slipping vs. Falling**
   - **Metaphor**: Unwholesome thoughts are like slipping on a path, but with awareness, you can catch yourself without falling. Falling represents full immersion in dukkha (suffering); slipping is a near-miss that can be corrected.
   - **Extension**: Compared to dancers or athletes who slip but recover gracefully—showing skill in maintaining balance.
   - **Purpose**: Encourages mindful recovery from unwholesome thoughts without self-judgment.

4. **The Cowherd and the Cows (from Sutta 19)**
   - **Metaphor**: The mind’s thoughts are like cows. In a “village” (distracting, tempting situations), the cowherd must actively control them with a stick (mindful correction). In the open pasture (a wholesome state), the cows graze peacefully, and the cowherd can rest under a tree.
   - **Purpose**: Explains the progression from effortful mindfulness (first jhana) to natural restfulness (second jhana). Emphasizes that thoughtless states arise naturally from a well-managed, wholesome mind, not by force.

5. **Paradise and the Tree**
   - **Metaphor**: Living in paradise but judging parts of it (e.g., a tree with yellow leaves) as undesirable. Removing everything we dislike would destroy the paradise.
   - **Link**: Connected to the **story of Adam and Eve**—eating the fruit of knowledge of good and evil represents introducing judgment (duality), which destroys unity/paradise.
   - **Purpose**: Teaches that judgment (good/bad, like/dislike) creates duality; acceptance (“I don’t know and I don’t care”) restores a sense of paradise in the present.

6. **Colors and the Six Answers**
   - **Metaphor**: A question with only “yes” or “no” as apparent answers actually has six possible answers: yes, no, both, neither, “I don’t know,” and “I don’t care.”
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrates how moving beyond binary (dualistic) thinking to “I don’t know and I don’t care” represents a unified, non-judgmental mind.

### **Stories and Analogies:**

1. **Adam and Eve**
   - Used to illustrate how the knowledge of good and evil (judgment) introduces duality and exile from unity/paradise.

2. **Child Learning to Walk**
   - Children fall, then learn to slip without falling, showing how progress in mindfulness is similar—we learn to catch unwholesome thoughts before they cause a “fall.”

3. **Parent/Parrot Rule Internalization**
   - We internalize rules from parenting like parrots—repeating them without understanding, leading to self-criticism.

4. **Monastic Confessional Practice**
   - Referencing a sutta (likely on Patticcasamuppada) where monks confess faults to a teacher to practice honesty and reduce self-deception.

5. **Western vs. Practical Meditation Goals**
   - Contrasts Western pursuit of “no-mind” as a goal (seen as dualistic striving) with the Buddha’s gradual path: cultivate wholesome thoughts first, and peaceful states arise naturally.

### **Overall Teaching Purpose**:
The metaphors and stories collectively emphasize:
- **Duality** = inner conflict, judgment, rules, denial, striving.
- **Unity** = acceptance, mindfulness, compassion, comfort with not-knowing, and wholesome thinking.
- The path is practical, here-and-now, not a magical distant goal.
