### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome folks. This is Sunday afternoon, September the what, 7th? Wow. Moving right along with time then. So today we're going to talk about a special term called Kaliyana Metta, Mudita. Kalyanamitta. Now, Kalyanamitta is sort of a special relationship. The word mitta in this regard is very similar to the word Metta, and it has similar usage also. And you can think of the word mitta as a friend, but The Kalyana is what makes it kind of special in the sense that it's not an ordinary friend, it's not even a noble friend or a Dhamma friend, not a teacher and certainly not a guru, but rather a person that you have deep trust in to be a spiritual guide. Now most people never get one. I was lucky enough to have one in Ajahn Po, but most people on the spiritual path never have that kind of special relationship with one other person who is fully trusted in the Dhamma. Now this word Kalyanamitta is actually in the suttas. It's not an ancient, let us say, an added word after but it actually is part of the original teaching of the Buddha, then in fact that was his job. Rather than being a teacher, he was known as Sakyamuni, and the word "muni" is actually a teacher, but it's that special relationship that we have with the student that let us say, is it takes contact. You have to be around the student, and the student has to be around his spiritual friend. So sometimes we use the word teacher when in fact it is a Kaliyamita, but most of the time teachers are too far away. That's especially true for a guru where there's a lot of students around the guru, and a lot of them are actually there as guardians to keep you getting too close to the guru. And not only that, but they want money. And so the Buddha never charged any money. In fact, We can say that the Dharma itself is too priceless to charge money for. It's not something that goes to the market. In fact, Catherine was just mentioning that a lot of places call themselves Buddhist places, and I want to make a distinction. In Western Buddhism, that we are not Buddhist in that regard, and that the term that I normally use would be Buddha-Dharma as the teaching, and that we're not Buddhist. And the reason that I'd say that is because Buddhism and Buddhist are, let us say, all the backbenchers, all the outsiders, all the ones that never get into the inner circle. Now, Buddhism are actually the teachings of the Buddha, and the inner circle we can refer to as the nobles, the ones who actually understand the teachings of the Buddha, and they practice it, and they share it with one another. Now, due to historical reasons, Starting or during around the 12th century, Buddhism, or all of Buddhism including insiders and outsiders and everything, they were kind of wiped out in India, completely destroyed. Nalanda University and all of the places where the monks visited and even the Bodhi Tree was destroyed. This was done in a collaboration between the Brahmins, who had been historically the enemies of the Buddha, and the Mughal Empire, the Turkish, or what was to become the Ottoman Empire, who came in and basically knocked down just not the Bodhi Tree, but literally destroyed all the trees in India, taking them back to what is now modern Turkey. And so because of the long-term adversarial relationship between the Brahmins and the Buddhists, and because of the destruction during that time, actually those who understood the Dharma correctly took two paths. One, they just lived in Nirodha, but many of them took a hike. And many of them not only took a hike, but they went into places like Pakistan and Vietnam and even Thailand during that time. Now, Thailand had already had Buddha, Dhamma there, since about 700 AD, but there was a great new influx of monks starting in the 12th and the 13th century. And during this time, there was kind of a decision made, and that is that let's leave Buddhism as a religion just like all of the other religions so they can fight all of these religions, while we will leave the inner core, the inner teachings, secret. And it became a secret society. And even monks who normally were ordained were not given the actual teachings of the Buddha, that in fact what Buddhism became is more like Hinduism or animism of the day. So the actual noble teachings of the Buddha are very simple, but you need kind of a close-hand teacher to show you the way to do a simple task. It's sort of like automobile mechanics. Automobile mechanics don't learn how to take an engine apart out of a book. They just don't. The same thing is true with music. Very, very rarely do you find someone who doesn't have any kind of teacher at all. And in fact, one student I had says, "Oh, well, I learned the drums all on my own." And I says, "Oh, and you didn't watch other drummers?" You didn't go on YouTube and see what they were doing. You didn't take any drummer's lessons online or whatnot like that. And he agreed that yes, we have to get it from someone else. That in fact, there is a sutra where— this is, by the way, number 108 in the Majjhima Nikaya. It happened after Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Ananda was out.

**Speaker A:** On a picnic, and he, let us say, ran across the Brahmin who had some questions for him. Then they get interrupted, and then at the end of the sutra, he comes back to the original question that the Brahmin asked. The Brahmin was asking, what is the difference between the Buddha himself and all of the noble monks who were left after he died. Now, in fact, many of the best students of the Buddha, like Sariputta, actually died before the Buddha did. But what Ananda said at that point was that there is no difference or no distinction between what the Buddha had attained and what all of these other monks had attained, except for one thing, and that is the Buddha figured it out for himself. He got it on his own. Now, what he said was that he got it by discovering an old ancient path. It was a rediscovery of a path, but that when he took on students, when he became the spiritual friend of various monks, It was a close relationship where he monitored and stayed with them. So that's the basic difference, that if you actually understand the teachings of the Buddha, there's actually several different ways to understand it in the sense that you can understand it intellectually and never practice. That's actually possible. That in fact there's very solid evidence that some Brahmins actually understood what the Buddha was teaching, and they hated him for it. Why did they hate him for it? It's because if his family became, let's say, skilled in the teachings of the Buddha, they'd be out of business. If the people came to the Brahmins and the Brahmins were teaching what the Buddha taught, they'd be out of business because what the Brahmins did was they made a huge amount of fortune by doing rituals and other things like that for the people. But the Buddha taught something else that was actually quite simple, simple to understand intellectually, but that it takes practice just like anybody Like in the 1950s, anybody can turn on the radio and listen to a pop song and hum along with it, but that's not the same thing as picking up the instrument, learning to play it, and getting on stage and performing it. It's not the same. So also it is true of the Buddha, Dharma. We can understand it intellectually, but we need a guide who's going to keep pushing and reminding and cajoling us to actually practice it. Now what that means is that the mind is already badly trained. Everybody has a kind of training that they go through of school and education where they don't train the mind to see, they train the mind to do. And so we— in fact, what Bhikkhuni is saying is that school trains the children to learn something and to be able to repeat it back without fully understanding it, and at the same time, they hate school. It's very, very rare to find a kid who actually likes school. Most kids don't like school. They may like it the first day, it's interesting the first day, but it becomes a grind. We wind up then living almost our entire life in a grind, where whatever we do, we're not happy. And we're told, "Oh, this is important and that is important. Oh, exercise is important. Oh, good health is important." And there's a whole lot of really healthy, unhappy people. What the teachings of the Buddha is really all about is the teaching of training the mind to enjoy what's happening right here, right now. This actually is very well known. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it as a change model. We have to see in this moment where we have that mentality of it being a grind, doing what we're told to do without enjoying it, and making a big change to that. And the first change that we need to learn to do is to get away from that grind, only to find out that we took it with us. And then when we see that we've got the grind already built into the mind, that's when we begin to change that grind into, this is good enough. Life is okay right now the way that it is. There's actually no problems with the world right now. Other than what we don't like about it. And so we make that stuff up. We've been taught to make up stuff, to make up horror stories, to entertain ourselves and our friends with our own miserable horror stories. That's the training that most Westerners get. In fact, all over the world, you could go so far as to say that when someone is in a religion, They're really trained into horror stories. They become, let us say, under the thumb of someone who is trying to get something out of them. Preachers, for instance, they like to have a large congregation. Many gurus in India, they like to have a large congregation. They also like to pass out the collection plate. Even some of the collection plates also have voter registration pamphlets in them so that people will go and do what they're told to do. And this is the difference between one who is a teacher or an Anapanasati teacher versus a Kaliyan Metta who is one who really does care that you're practicing the Dharma correctly so that you're getting great benefit out of it right from the beginning. That the teaching of the Buddha is in fact known to be a direct path. It's not a gradual path. It's direct. But we're trained in the idea of a gradual path. For instance, Christianity has a really gradual path. You cannot get any benefits out of Christianity until after you're dead. Then you can go to heaven. But if you're practicing the Buddha, Dharma correctly, then you've got that heaven right here, right now. Go directly there. But gosh, it's hard to find someone who knows how to do that. And so if you can find someone who knows how to do that, you need to start paying close attention. Get close to them, see what they've got, and start emulating it, doing what they're saying to do. This is what a real Kalyanametta is, is one who will make sure that you're practicing correctly. Practicing what? Practicing, like I said, a change model, to see what we're doing that is causing discomfort, dissatisfaction, and change it into comfort and satisfaction, so that we can have a happy, joyful life right here, right now. This is the job of a Kaliyana Metta. Of guiding one right away. Now, one of the things that happens is, is that we've started to experiment because of the internet, that it takes a bit longer to get it done, but it is almost as good as having a Kali Anametta right there around you. Now, when I was a young monk at Wat Suan Mokkh, I immediately fell into a relationship with Ajahn Po, who happened to have been the abbot of Wat Suan Mokkh. But he cared for me. He looked after me. He came to visit me on a daily basis. He wanted to make sure that I had what I needed. And what I needed most was to stop needing things and to just be satisfied with what was there. And so we have been experimenting with this online and come to the conclusion that it actually can be done that way. But I would recommend that you spend time every day, perhaps several times a day, remembering to look at what you're doing, to practice correctly by change, to change the unhappy thoughts to happy thoughts. This is very, very interesting. This is actually upside down to the way that society has been training all of the children. Why? Because society wants something out of the child. Mommy and Daddy want to be proud of their children. The industrial people, they want to put the child to work. The church officials, they want the child to work so that they can give donations to the church and go to church on a Sunday so that the clergy will feel good. Well, guess what? A Kali Anametta doesn't care about that kind of stuff. He only wants to know, are you in fact getting it right here, right now? Are you getting the benefit of the Dharma right away? This is the only job of the Kali Anametta, is to be able to see what's happening and maybe slap you around a bit to wake you up, to say, "No, that's not the right way to do it. Let's do it correctly." And so this is the entire teaching of the Buddha, in fact, is that it's done almost always on a one-on-one basis. Now, one of the things that I can say very happily is that I have enough students around that this has actually started to work. Not just started to work, but we've got it working. Agnes is one. Ivan is one. Karwan is one. Let's see, Mikey is one. Amrit, you're coming along. Caleb, you're getting it. We've actually got some people who actually really understand the teachings of the Buddha And you now can take on that job of that guidance on a one-on-one basis. When the student is posting a bunch of stupid crap, stupid questions, you can tell them these are stupid questions and point them back into the right direction. Now, that doesn't always work. In fact, there is a saying that when the student is ready, the teacher will show up, which means then that most people are not ready for a teacher because when one does show up, they miss it. They think they're being criticized or fussed at rather than being guided. And so this is the way that This is actually the reason why the noble group is so small in the world. One of them is, no, many, most of the people, in fact more than 90%, never really hear the Dhamma. Of those who hear the Dhamma, most of them don't practice the Dhamma. Of those who practice the Dhamma, sometimes they get intermittent and they do a bit here and there and then they stop. Practicing, but there are also those who hear the Dhamma, know the Dhamma, practice the Dhamma, practice it more, and get very good at it. So the example would be that nowadays we see it on television, but how many people have ever stood beside or actually touched a grand piano? Not very many people throughout the world have actually stood beside or touched a grand piano, never mind sitting down at it. And then, how many students have actually been able to— let's change it from a grand piano to a pipe organ, because those are even more rare. There's a lot of people who will go to church and there's going to be a pipe organ there at the church, but very few of the people in the congregation of the church church actually sit down to the pipe organ, never possibly even getting any instructions on how to play the pipe organ, including with the feet and all the stops and all the registers and all of that kind of stuff. But there are some who know that stuff, and yet they still don't practice. But there's occasionally some that do practice, but they don't practice very much. And then there are those who practice and practice and practice and get great benefit out of it. Okay, so the same thing is true with the Dhamma. Most of the people in the world will never hear the Dhamma. Of those who actually hear the Dhamma and begin to understand how easy it is to practice, still don't practice. And then there are those who practice a little bit, and then they'll quit and maybe come back to it. And then there are those who will actually practice and practice and practice, and those are the ones who, because of that practice, will gain great benefit. And that the Kaliyana Metta's job is to make you sit there and practice. That's his job, is to get you to actually practice the Dharma, to practice being joyful, to practice coming out of the delusions, the fears, the junk in the mind, and put something wholesome in the mind over and over and over and over again. That's what is valuable about the practice. And this is why we need to keep coming back. Now, a good substitute for a Kali Ametta would be noble friends, others like we have here on this Discord group. We have a lot of people who know how to practice and they'll give you good advice, including to continue to practice. That's the injunction that we have. I've told this to Paul, I've told this to Carl. I see you, Carl, and Tim and Timo. In fact, good Timo, you've been practicing very well, my friend. Continue doing that. This is the whole point, is that— here's the way to say it— is that when you are practicing correctly, even if you haven't done it for a month, you're going to get good value out of that moment in time when you are practicing. But this is the direct path. You get that joy juice as soon as you practice correctly. And if people could see that, why don't they continue to practice? It's kind of crazy. Why don't people practice? I mean, you get so much benefit out of it. Why do we quit? This is the job of the Kamma Yametta, is to keep reminding the students over and over again, you've gotten so much value out of it, you know the great fruit that you have by practicing Anapanasati, that you know that the only way out of your suffering is by practicing the Eightfold Noble Path. We know that. Why don't we practice? Why don't we keep practicing that? Why don't we practice it more and more and more? Then in fact, we can practice it anytime. It doesn't matter what you're doing. You can be driving a car. Are you going to be driving the car absent-mindedly on the phone, yelling at the kids in the back, or lollygagging, seeing the road collisions and all of that kind of stuff? Are you going to be happily paying attention to the road. That in fact, good Dharma students make excellent automobile drivers. They don't get into accidents because they're watching what they're doing. But look at the road statistics and you'll see that most people are not paying attention to the road. That's why they have accidents. Yeah, they can go down the road for a while, but as soon as the old lady jumps out in front of their car, If they start thinking about, "Oh, lady, you shouldn't be in front of my car," they're going to hit her. No, you've got to be quick to make that change so that you don't hit her. The same thing is true about our own unwholesome thoughts, is to be able to see those unwholesome thoughts and to change them quickly. But that takes a skill. We have to practice that skill over and over and over. We need to practice so that we can get very good at it. And this is the job of a Kalyanametta, a friend who is going to keep pushing you to practice. Just like a good piano teacher is going to keep pushing the student to practice, to practice, to practice. This is the way that we get the mind in a very good shape. So, what do you think, Christina? Have you got a Kalyanamita? Sure do. Yeah, I appreciate all the friends I've made here in the Sangha, definitely. Thank you. So Ivan, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's true. Every time you remember to practice, the fruit is right there and then. You don't have to wait for 30 minutes or sitting for 10 minutes or whatever. You don't have to, yeah, just immediate.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you get the immediate benefit. Wow, what a relief it is! I don't have to think about the bank. I can just be happy immediately. Just throw out all of those unhappy thoughts, all of that. Throw out the fear. In fact, there's a very easy way if you've got fear, is to recognize it right here, right now. You've got nothing to fear in this present moment. There is no reason to fear. But in the sutta, in the Anapanasati Sutta, it talks about going to the forest, going to a foot of a tree, or going to an empty hut or a pile of straw. And what we do here is, is that we recognize that our private room is that empty hut. And when we say it's empty, what that means is it is empty of all of the dangers. For instance, Catherine, are there any alligators in your room?

**Speaker C:** No, no, not at all. Just a cat.

**Speaker A:** Just a cat. Okay. Is it a man-eating cat?

**Speaker C:** No, he's pretty chill.

**Speaker A:** All right. So in that regard, you also, you don't have any Russian mafia breaking in.

**Speaker D:** Nope.

**Speaker A:** All right, if we can keep track of that, then we can sit in that room and say, wow, look, this is an empty room. There's nothing here to fear. The only thing that I've got to fear is the stuff that I can dream up. And when I stop dreaming up fears, guess what? I don't feel afraid. I could feel safe and secure. So this is a major part of the practice. I would say, in fact, that If we can't do this one thing, this is what we need to practice on, is the practice of being, feeling safe. That we don't have any problems, we don't have any worries. We can say that: no problems, no worries, everything is already okay. There's nothing to attain. I don't need to be this or that or the other thing. I don't even need to be enlightened. That when I see that I don't need to be enlightened, that's enlightenment, is when you recognize you don't need anything. You're already there. There's nothing to be afraid of, no place to go, nothing to do. But we have to practice that because we're really skilled at dreaming stuff up. We make shit up. This is what is the word perception. We perceive dangers where there's none there. We perceive jobs to do when there's none there. We perceive ugliness when it's not there. We perceive dissatisfaction when in fact it's not there. So if we can start to practice perceiving 'Everything is all right, everything is okay, not a worry in the world,' and keep practicing that, guess what? We begin to get that attitude. Basically, we can say that we're born as a victim. An infant, when it comes out of the womb, can't move his hands, can't feed itself. The only thing that an infant can do is cry. So we start out our life crying, wanting stuff. And as we grow into little children, guess what? Mommy wants us to hold her hand. Mommy says, you've got to do this, you've got to go to school, you got to pick up your toys. And we stay in that victim's mentality as children. And then we go to higher schools and we stay a victim. Then we go to university and then we get a job and we're now the victim of the bank victim of the employer. Even the employer himself is a victim, only he's a victim of money. So what we need to see is, is that we have to practice right here, right now. There is no worry, there is no problem, there is no job to do. I could just rest. I could be okay. Everything is already All right, but that goes against everything that you've been taught your whole life. You've been taught to succeed. Guess what? You're already successful. All we have to do is have that attitude that I'm successful. Well, if we keep practicing over and over again of changing the thoughts from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought and get successful at that, That state of safe and secure and comfortable grows into a state of satisfaction. Wow, this really is good enough. And that state of satisfaction, when we keep practicing, grows into a state of successful. Wow, I can do this. I'm good at it. I'm successful at it. And this is a major milestone in one's life. In fact, there's a sutta where the Buddha says that when the student comes to the point that he recognizes that no matter how obstructed the mind is, no matter how many hindrances there are in the mind, no matter how many ugly, bad, unwholesome thoughts there are, he can see that and clean it out immediately and come into a state of seeing things the way that they really are. Like for instance, your room. It's just an okay room. Got no problems, no worries, no point, nothing. It's already okay. So when we can come to that, this is what is called the first knowledge. The first knowledge is that no matter what happens, you can clean the mind. Well, very few people are being able to do that. In fact, those who have never heard of the Dhamma don't understand that at all. They think, in fact, that they're victims of their own feelings, victims of their own thoughts, rather than recognizing that you actually can control your own thoughts, you can control your feelings, and feel the way that you want to feel. When you can control your thoughts and your feelings to the way that you want to feel, That's real success, and it comes with a "Wow, I can do this!" And back to the Kali Yama, you need to be around people who can come and say, "Wow, I can do this!" And not only that, but, "Wow, you can do it too! You can do this! You can come out of your misery, you can come out of your anxiety, you can come out of your fear, you can come out of your greed." and just be okay. It's an easy thing to do, but very few teachers ever are able to teach that because they haven't experienced it for themselves. And lucky enough, when you have a Kalyametta— this is what actually is referred to as a lineage, is when you have a Kalyametta who trains a student, and that student then becomes a Kalyametta and they can train his next student, and that student becomes a Paramita, and we pass this wow feeling, this this is so good kind of feeling, all the way down for 2,500 years. Isn't that marvelous? This system has worked for 2,500 years successively, just not for everybody, just a select few. And like I said before, most people never hear of it. I'd say more than 90% of those 90% that hear about the Dhamma, only about 10% of them practice it. And only about 10% of those practice and practice and practice to get good enough. And so now we're down to 99.9% of the people don't get the benefit, but that 0.01% can. I invite you to be part of that group by practicing over and over and over again. Practice getting that wow feeling. This is so good. I can do this. So Tom G., what do you think?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, thanks, Thanks again, Dhammarato. Brilliant, brilliant talk. I'm finding more and more really practical opportunities to practice this. I've been waking up— I run a business and it's quite stressful, and I've noticed I wake up in the middle of the night quite often with worries about like, you know, am I going to be able to pay everyone's salary? What if this happens? What if that happens? But I think The mindset shift.

**Speaker A:** Then why would you run a business? You could be better off without running that business.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, true, true, true, true. Well, yes and no, because I love— it brings a lot of joy, but it comes with stress.

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't. You add the stress. It's like getting a big piece of cake, and instead of adding ice cream, you add a pile of shit to it.

**Speaker E:** Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's what the, the point I just wanted to make is that I've, I've now seen these moments where I wake up. I've, I'm still bringing some of that baggage with me, but I'm seeing the opportunity to, um, you know, each time that happens, I wake up with the opportunity to practice and to that sort of change model and to instantly apply the benefits of the teaching. And even last night when it happened, rather than getting frustrated like, oh no, I can't sleep, I saw it as like, wow, this is an opportunity to let go of all of that crap. So yeah, I find it really, really effective. And I think just transitioning from the gradual model to that idea that you can just let go of it here and now has been really, really helpful. So yeah, so thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the amazing thing. Most people, because of almost everything that you do in life, is a gradual path. Now, I've talked about practicing music, practicing the piano. If you come up to a piano and you hit one note and it makes one note, that's practice. And guess what? You're making music by hitting just one note. And if you like doing that, then you can hit 2 or 3 notes. The point is, is that do you like doing it? Are you getting immediate benefit from it right then and there? And I've seen so many people practicing various kinds of meditation and they don't enjoy it. So this is what we're going to do, is we're going to practice enjoying what we're doing, and the best place to start is by enjoying being doing nothing. So you wake up in the night and you say, "Wow, I don't have to worry about the job at all. Those people will get paid and I don't have to worry about it. I can just sit here and just enjoy the night. I don't even have to go back to sleep. What a rest it is just to be here, no place to go, nothing to do." and just relaxed. That's the way to practice. So every opportunity is an opportunity to practice. Every moment is an opportunity to wake up and remember that things are okay right now. You don't have to worry about payday until payday. So, Caleb, what do you think?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, the big emphasis on practice for me has been really, really fundamental to my overall kind of progress. And yeah, just a big thank you for that because just the repeated emphasis on coming back and being okay with the present moment, being satisfied right here and now has been life-changing. So yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the job. The job of the Kalyana Metta is to remind people to do it, to do it now, to keep practicing. Many people say, oh, well, I don't know enough about Buddhism. Let me go read another book or two, and then I'll understand what I'm doing. And all of that time that they're reading, they're not happy. And now, and not only that, but the worst is, is that, and they're not practicing. This is really so simple, is to just change the thoughts that you're having. And you don't need a thousand different books to read. All you need to do is to practice. And this is the job of the Kalyana Metta, is to make sure that that's what you're doing. You're practicing. So, Kersheny, what do you think? How about you, Carl? Good to see you back again, my friend.

**Speaker B:** Hello. I don't have anything to say. Just keep going. I like to listen to you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I would like it if you'd start practicing what you're hearing. Can you do that? Can you start practicing everything is okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world?

**Speaker B:** Yep, I agree, everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, how about you, Tim? Yeah, I just really like your weekly reminder as I cannot read the term, but the reminder is very nice. And also the Hangouts are very good as a reminder, as a substitute, like you said. Timo, what'd you say, friend? Hello, Timo.

**Speaker G:** Timo says can't talk, on the train.

**Speaker A:** What was that? What was that, Mikey?

**Speaker G:** Timo says can't talk, on the train.

**Speaker A:** Oh, he's on a train. Okay. Is it a happy train? So Tom, what do you think? Tom G., are you there?

**Speaker E:** I already spoke.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. Yeah, I just turned my camera off.

**Speaker E:** All right, nothing else to add.

**Speaker A:** Nothing. Okay, Ivan, how about you? Janis?

**Speaker H:** Yeah, it's very good in the Discord. There are a lot of Kali Yatanas. Like sometimes I start talking about, like I remember yesterday I was Talking a lot about the hindrance of restlessness and trying to describe it. And then, like Alex reminded me, you know, to practice now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we don't have to worry about all of those terms and everything because we can just say what is a hindrance is whatever you're doing that's hindering you from being happy right now. Being joyful. And boy, do we have a lot of different steps that we can think about to be called a hindrance to being joyful. We're very skilled at being unhappy. So let's develop the skill by practicing being happy. So, Red, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** Yes, yes. Yeah, I was having a pain, a source of pain in my left shoulder. And I was just— how do I say it? I was just paying really close attention to it and whatever that arose, just let go. I was being really grateful for, wow, I can feel all of this. That is amazing. And then it just— only the pain remained, not the suffering from it. And sometimes it comes back. We don't have a perfect mind with perfect information, but doing that repeatedly looks like it's a key. I even have to add to To the friendships question, yes, we follow, we congregate together, we have a meditation circle in VR. We do that in a place that people come and they come with all sorts of afflictions in their mind and we just give, we try to relay as much as of your teachings, even Eckhart Tolle's teachings and the suttas directly to them, to just ask them to relax and to be happy. Just put a smile on it. It's fine. We are here for it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I'm very pleased to see, and you're just giving me another example, that over the past 10 years, the general public's idea of Buddhism was that of a religion, including mindfulness meditation, Vipassana, noting methods, Goenka methods, everything about it was hard work. And now I'm seeing that somehow or another, the good stuff is actually beginning to get through to the general population that all we have to do is to just be happy. Practice being happy because we're not naturally happy, we're naturally miserable. So we have to practice being happy. And so I'm glad to hear that, Red, that wherever you go, whatever group that you're in, you can remind them, never mind, just be happy right now. You don't have to have any special formal techniques of practice. And in fact, the Eightfold Noble Path is all we need to do is to remember to look at the crap that we're presenting and then change it. That's the whole model. Very simple model.

**Speaker I:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** So, so, yeah, if I could actually add to it, some— we have, we have neurodivergencies. And some people will be really fond of rules. So using those rules for the people just to allow them to have an easier opening, to just relax. And we can use, we can guide them to just dissolve the rules little by little and be able to relax, just to have a tongue-in-cheek to allow them to come, allow them just to do this, just to relax.

**Speaker G:** We're trying.

**Speaker A:** Take it easy. Okay, go ahead, Karshni.

**Speaker G:** Still, this thing I can talk about. Yeah, I've been trying to relay the Dhamma to people who join our meditations, and still I need to, well.

**Speaker B:** How.

**Speaker G:** Do I say it in a wholesome way? I'm doing my best.

**Speaker A:** To be honest with you, that is ordinary. You've been heard that all your life. In fact, well, I'm doing my best, which is an excuse for failure. And a better thing to say is, never mind, start again. You're okay already. Just practice. You don't have to do your best. In fact, doing your best is quite a struggle. I recommend to everybody to stop trying to do your best and just enjoy what you have now. You don't have to improve anything. You're already okay. Practice that.

**Speaker H:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** Can I add one more thing? Can we strive for the best, but allowing ourselves just to repeat it again and again and again? We don't have to force it to be the best practice, but allowing that striving, but not doing in a sense of desire, just being a light. Wow, what I did, that's interesting. It looks really interesting what we did. It looks like this close. Oh, now that's shitty. But we just kept doing it. Oh, here we got this.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati Sutta, in almost every one of the items of the 16, It has the little phrase, "Thus one trains oneself." So the training, or the skill development, will happen if you're actually practicing. You have to keep practicing and practicing. But if you have a goal in mind of, "I'm going to make this perfect," then that's actually not practicing. That's wanting something you don't have. The better thing to do is just enjoy the practice, because the practice itself will bring on the skill development. And the skill development that we really need the most is the skill development of remembering to be in this present moment. Remember to be here now. That's the number one major skill to learn. The second skill to learn, which is also just as important, is the skill of looking. Remembering to look and then to make a change and wanting it done right is not that. Wanting it done right, in fact, any kind of wanting is not what we're practicing. We're practicing already having whatever, so that we don't want anything. Coming out of the wanting into being satisfied with the way things actually are already. And that's a skill that can be developed. But as soon as you want it developed, now we're practicing something else. That's one of the subtle points. The subtlety is to stop wanting anything and be satisfied with the way things are right now. That's what brings a smile. Wanting to have a smile is not the same as just having a smile.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that is actually relates to one of Eckhart Tolle's talks of the problem of the spiritual seeker is that he is seeking for something instead of just being okay with the now. So they will strive for something that's— it's like a pig with a carrot. You never get to it. It's like it's always unobtainable instead of the now that's here. So the guy just keeps looking, just keeps seeking for it.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the point is, is that wanting something is the habit that we have. And so if you want something and then you get it, what are you going to do with that wanting habit? You're going to want something else. Which means then that no matter how high you go, you're going to have a goal higher than that, so that the higher you go, the higher the goal will be. Stop having goals and just be okay with where you are.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And let the goal practice take care of itself.

**Speaker B:** This is oriented rather than goal-oriented. Right.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we're coming out of being goal-oriented. And what are we oriented to? We're oriented into being non-oriented, oriented into— we've already got the Orient, or in our case, Oreos. We've got them. We don't have to want anything. We've already got it. Is it good enough right here, right now? That's the whole point, is that there is no goal necessary. You're already that which you are. So Robert, do you have something to say?

**Speaker B:** It all sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Just thank you, Dhammarato. Okay, does anybody else have something to say? How about you, David? David's not here. Robert, what do you think, Robert?

**Speaker B:** No, just, just thank you.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good. What'd you say, Amrit?

**Speaker I:** Thank you, Dhammarato. It's, uh, quite amazing, and I'm amazed again and again that how simple the practice is. You just have to remember to look and then make a change. And yeah, it keeps surprising me. I'm hearing you for like quite some time now, and I'm practicing for quite a while, but this simplicity just keeps surprising me again and again. Just so amazing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, excellent. So anybody? Oh, Agnes. Please let us have it. As I said before, Agnes is about the oldest student that we have. I've had a relationship with Agnes for 25 years or so on Yahoo groups so many years ago. Go ahead, Agnes.

**Speaker J:** I'm so happy for your teachings. I don't really know what to say, but this practice has been life-changing for me. The joy and how I can trust life and be happy and joyful and all of these things, be a good friend, I've learned to, whatever happens and it's a big gift, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Pleasure. Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** So, sorry, did you say Ivan? Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Cameron.

**Speaker C:** So over the past few years, I found a huge amount of peace and joy in simplicity. In like not wanting to change how I look or what I'm achieving or, you know, any of the sort of stories that we invent about who we are. Dropping all of that and then going back to, I don't know, just the simplicity of the moment and the joy that it brings has been like so important for me. It's something you can access anywhere, anytime. And I feel like I don't need anything anymore because I know what I am. But at the same time, I don't know. I don't feel that I need a teacher. I don't feel I need anything, but maybe I do. Maybe I need someone to keep me on track.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what you'll find here on this Discord group. I recommend that you come on and make statements and talk to others. Have some friends. One of the most important qualities now about this Kalyana Metta that I've talked about is that it brings about a feeling of friendship. The friends that we have on this Discord group is quite amazing. This is a very unique Discord group because we're all here to help each other Be happy. This is what is the word in the Pali is Sangha, a noble Sangha. It's like having friends that are out to do you good. Friends to help you. And so this is a great place to have friends. So Ivan, did you ever wind up having something to say?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no, I thought that you're referring to me, so I opened my mic. So no, nothing to say.

**Speaker A:** Nothing to say. All right, well, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home then?

**Speaker G:** Sure thing. Uh, yeah, going to mention a few things. Uh, even, yeah, as Dhammarato mentioned, uh The Buddha discovered the path, but even the Buddha had friends along the way to help him out. And yeah, it's really helpful to have noble friends in this practice, to have Kaliya Metta and just sort of giving a little bit of a testimony of my own practice is I spent a couple of years listening to Dhamma talks all day long. There would be some days we'd listen to Dhamma talks for hours on end, right? And did that for several years. But it wasn't until I made friends here on this group where I really started to see the practice sort of take hold, we could say, or blossom. And yeah, just want to say very thankful for the friends made here. And, you know, yeah, even if you feel like, oh, I don't need a teacher or something like that, yeah, that's okay. But it can also be like it's just something that's nice to do. To have friends and to share the practice with one another. We don't have to need one another. We can just enjoy the noble friendship. So yeah, thank you, friends, for being here. And it's an inspiring thing to see for this practice as well, people practicing the noble Buddha Dharma. So yeah, if you're watching this on YouTube or listening on iTunes, Spotify, etc., come check us out, come make some friends. And for you guys here, yeah, continue to make friends with one another and continue to inspire each other to practice and to, yeah, just take it easy, take care, and have a good one.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, so as this call winds up, I invite each and every one of you to stay on after I and Mikey leave, and we'll turn the video recorder off, and you guys can just meet with each other, discuss what we've had to say today, and make some friends. Okay, so thank you all. Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with participation from Sangha friends, centers on the crucial concept of a **Kalyāṇa-mitta** (spiritual friend or noble friend) and the essence of genuine Buddha-Dhamma practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Role of a Kalyāṇa-mitta**
*   A **Kalyāṇa-mitta** is not an ordinary friend, teacher, or guru. It is a deeply trusted spiritual guide who ensures you are practicing correctly and gaining immediate benefit from the Dhamma.
*   This relationship is intimate and hands-on, based on the model of the Buddha with his students. Its primary job is to persistently remind, encourage, and sometimes "slap you around" (figuratively) to keep you practicing correctly.
*   Most people never find such a guide. Dhammarato shares his good fortune in having Ajahn Po fulfill this role for him.

### **Historical Context & "Secret" Dhamma**
*   The talk presents a historical narrative: After the destruction of Buddhism in India (circa 12th century), the true "inner core" or noble teachings of the Buddha were deliberately kept secret to protect them, while outward "Buddhism" became more ritualistic and religious.
*   A distinction is made between **"Buddhism"** (the religion with its institutions) and **"Buddha-Dhamma"** (the direct, liberating teachings practiced by the noble ones). The group identifies with the latter.

### **The Essence of Practice: A Direct Path to Happiness Now**
*   The Buddha-Dhamma is a **direct path**, not a gradual one. The fruit of practice—joy, peace, freedom from suffering—is available **immediately**, not after death or long years of struggle.
*   The core practice is a **"change model"**: 1) **Remember to look** at your mind state in the present moment, and 2) **Change** unwholesome, unhappy, fearful thoughts into wholesome, happy, peaceful ones.
*   The goal is to **train the mind to enjoy the present moment**, seeing that "everything is already okay." This involves letting go of the ingrained "victim mentality" and the habit of "making shit up" (creating problems through perception).
*   Practice should be **enjoyable** from the very beginning, like enjoying a single note on a piano. If practice feels like a grind, you're doing it wrong.

### **The Gradual Path vs. The Direct Path**
*   Society and most religions train us in a **gradual path** of striving, goals, and delayed gratification (e.g., heaven after death).
*   Buddha-Dhamma is the opposite: **Stop wanting, striving, and seeking**. Be satisfied and happy with what is, right here and now. The desire for enlightenment itself can be a hindrance.

### **The Sangha as a Substitute for a Kalyāṇa-mitta**
*   In the absence of a single personal guide, a **noble Sangha** (spiritual community) can serve a similar function. The Discord group itself is presented as an example—a place where friends remind each other to practice, share insights, and encourage immediate application of the Dhamma.
*   The talk emphasizes that **practice is everything**. Reading books or listening to talks without practicing is of little value. The Sangha's role is to keep each other practicing.

### **Key Takeaways from the Discussion**
*   **Practice is Simple:** Remember to look at your mind and change the thought pattern. It's about cultivating the skill of shifting from dissatisfaction to satisfaction.
*   **Immediate Benefit:** Every moment you remember to practice, you gain the fruit—relief, joy, peace—right then.
*   **Safety in the Present:** A practical method is to recognize your immediate environment (e.g., your room) is empty of real danger. Fear is a mental fabrication that can be dropped.
*   **From Victim to Success:** The ultimate success is realizing you can control your thoughts and feelings, moving from a state of wanting and worry to a state of "I am already successful; everything is okay."

### **Conclusion**
Dhammarato concludes by inviting everyone to be part of the small percentage that not only hears the Dhamma but practices it diligently and reaps its immediate benefits. He encourages using the Sangha of noble friends for support and reiterates the central message: **Stop wanting, start being satisfied, and practice finding joy in the present moment, repeatedly.**

The talk blends doctrinal explanation (Kalyāṇa-mitta, direct path), historical commentary, and very practical, down-to-earth guidance on mental training, all within the context of a supportive community.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk to explain the Dhamma and the role of a *Kalyanamitta* (spiritual friend):

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Automobile Mechanics:** Learning the Dhamma is compared to learning to be a mechanic. You can't learn to take an engine apart just from a book; you need hands-on guidance from someone who knows.
2.  **Learning Music (Piano/Drums):** Spiritual practice is repeatedly compared to learning a musical instrument.
    *   You can't learn the drums truly "on your own" without watching others, taking lessons, or emulating teachers (countering the idea of a purely self-taught path).
    *   Most people have seen or heard a grand piano (like hearing about Dhamma), few have touched one (like encountering it), fewer still learn to play it (practice), and only a dedicated few practice diligently enough to master it (attain great benefit).
    *   The **pipe organ** is used as an even rarer example to emphasize the scarcity of those who deeply practice.
    *   A good piano teacher's role—pushing the student to **practice**—is directly compared to the role of a *Kalyanamitta*.
3.  **The "Grind":** Modern life and conventional education are described as a "grind"—a repetitive, unhappy process where people are trained to "do" without understanding or enjoying. The Dhamma practice is a "change model" to escape this grind.
4.  **Pop Song Listener vs. Musician:** Understanding the Dhamma intellectually is likened to listening to a pop song on the radio and humming along. **Practicing** the Dhamma is compared to picking up the instrument, learning to play, and performing—a completely different level of engagement and skill.
5.  **Driving a Car:** A good Dhamma student is like an excellent, attentive driver who is fully present and thus avoids accidents. Most people, like inattentive drivers, are distracted by thoughts and thus "crash" into suffering.
6.  **Cake with a Pile of Shit:** In the dialogue with Tom G., the speaker says adding stress to a joyful endeavor (like running a business) is like getting a beautiful cake and then adding a pile of shit to it. The stress is an unnecessary, unwholesome addition.
7.  **The Pig and the Carrot (via Eckhart Tolle):** Referenced by a student, this metaphor describes the problem of the eternal "spiritual seeker" who is always chasing a future goal (the carrot) instead of being satisfied with the present moment. The goal is always just out of reach.
8.  **Goal-Oriented vs. "Oreo-Oriented":** The speaker plays on words, contrasting being goal-oriented (always wanting) with being "Oreo-oriented"—a humorous way to say you already have the treat (the present moment, satisfaction) and don't need to seek anything else.

### **Stories & Historical Narratives:**

1.  **Story of Ananda and the Brahmin (MN 108):** The speaker references this sutta where Ananda explains that the only difference between the Buddha and his enlightened disciples is that the Buddha discovered the path by himself, while the disciples relied on him as their guide. This story underscores the necessity of a guide (*Kalyanamitta*).
2.  **Historical Destruction of Indian Buddhism:** The speaker tells a story of the 12th-13th century collaboration between Brahmins and the Mughal/Ottoman invaders that destroyed Buddhist institutions (like Nalanda University) and even the Bodhi Tree. This led surviving true practitioners to:
    *   Go into seclusion (*Nirodha*).
    *   Flee to places like Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan.
    *   Make a strategic decision to let outer "Buddhism" become a conventional religion for the masses, while keeping the core, noble teachings secret and preserved within a lineage.
3.  **Personal Story with Ajahn Po:** The speaker shares his own experience as a young monk at Wat Suan Mokkh, where he had a *Kalyanamitta* in Ajahn Po. Ajahn Po visited him daily, cared for him, and his essential guidance was to help him "stop needing things and to just be satisfied with what was there."
4.  **The Infant as a Victim:** A brief story of the human condition: we are born as helpless infants who can only cry and want. We then grow up being told what to do by parents, schools, and employers, perpetuating a "victim mentality." The Dhamma practice is the way out of this ingrained story.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors:**
*   **The Direct Path vs. The Gradual Path:** The true Dhamma is a **direct path** to happiness here and now (like "go directly there" to heaven), contrasted with the **gradual path** of most religions and societal training, which promise future rewards (like heaven only after death).
*   **Inner Circle vs. Outer Circle (Backbenchers):** The "nobles" who understand and practice are the inner circle. "Buddhism" and "Buddhists" often refer to the outer circle or "backbenchers" who follow the religion culturally but don't engage with the core transformative practice.
*   **Empty Hut / Safe Room:** The "empty hut" from the suttas is metaphorically your own private room. When you see it's empty of real dangers (no alligators, no mafia), you realize fear is only created by the mind. This becomes a practice of recognizing safety in the present moment.

These metaphors and stories collectively build the talk's central argument: genuine spiritual progress requires **practice** (not just intellectual understanding), guided and encouraged by a **true spiritual friend (*Kalyanamitta*)** or a community of noble friends, to break free from conditioned suffering and find immediate satisfaction in the present.
