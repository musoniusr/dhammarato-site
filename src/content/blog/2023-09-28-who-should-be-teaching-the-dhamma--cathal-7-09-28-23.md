### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It may be just slow. So anyway, Kat, um, the topic that we're talking about is who could be and should be teaching the Dhamma. And we've gotten in it basically about 9/10 of the way into it with this question, in the sense that we've run across the monk who does not look like that he has right view, either ordinary right view or noble right view, which means the only possibility is that he is in wrong view. And as I said before, all societies train their children in ordinary right view, which means you can't get away with it. That's why they have rules, regulations, they have police, they've got armies, they've got priests, they've got Kamma machines, they've got gods and heavens and hells, in order to try to train the population when they're young into behaving in a way that will, let us say, allow the continuance of society. But if everybody fell into wrong view, you'd have constant warfare.

**Speaker B:** What if everybody in the society fell into right, right noble view?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's probably not going to happen because of circumstances. Okay, that people, in order to learn right noble view, they have to start at the foundation of right, ordinary right view, and then with the training. So this is why you've heard me talk about Sila comes first. Because Sila is based upon ordinary right view. And if somebody gets enough of the noble right view to see, okay, I can get away with it, then instead of going into the noble right view, he will fall into the wrong view. The wrong view is I can do what I want to do and get away with it, that it's okay if I harm people, and it's basically okay that I harm myself because then I get what I want, and what I want is more important than liberation. Yeah, wow. All right. And so when we're training students, that we have to train them from the ordinary right view into recognizing that they can come into a noble view that is both liberating and doesn't harm other people or yourself, but you don't get what you want until you change what you want. And when you wisely change what you want, then you can get it and have a happy life. Now, most of the society doesn't get well trained in ordinary right view, and they're very susceptible to falling back into wrong view. That in fact, a lot of ordinary right view is based in magical thinking. What is the magical thinking? That you can't get away with it no matter how many fences or how many pillars or how many belief systems or how many priests or armies they put in place. Most kids know that they can get away with it if they're sneaky and smart. Yeah, but that's basically where the politicians are, is that they learn how to get away with it. That's why rich men generally don't go to prison, as they're too smart to get caught. And it doesn't matter how many laws the legislation passes, they're not going to be able to outsmart the crooks. And so, we need to be able to find a way of training these kids in the sense of, oh yes, You may think that you can get away with it now, but eventually you won't. This is where the magical thinking comes in, because in fact the reality is, it doesn't matter how much magical thinking or how many rebirths or reincarnations or hells, heavens, any of that stuff is not going to stop people in their wrong actions due to their wrong view. That's why we have criminals in every society. That's why much of the society is in fact criminal. They just are able to get away with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, for instance, Walmart Are these big, big shopping places go to great lengths to try to prove to the crooks that they can't get away with it, and yet the crooks can outsmart them every time?

**Speaker B:** Every time.

**Speaker A:** Every time. Maybe not every time. Maybe eventually they'll slip up when they get sloppy because they think that they can get away with it, and so they stop taking the precautions. And there's many, many little things that people can do, like with the cameras. If you're going to steal something, put it in your basket like you're in front of the camera, like you're going to buy it, and then go find a part of the store that doesn't have the camera, and that's when you slip it in.

**Speaker B:** I could be honest, I used to do that as a teenager, so I know all about this very well.

**Speaker A:** Right, you know all about it. You know that you can get away with it, except now that you're in the Noble Dharma, you recognize that when you're doing it, you're not getting away with it because you're still in fear of getting caught. Yeah, and not only that, but you're angry at the store and make up some silly excuse of why it's okay to steal from these people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my rationality was, oh, this is a big corporate market, I could just steal all I want. I will not steal from the independent small little shops. That's not right. I can't do that. But I can, I can steal from these big corporates. Ah, that's okay. That's my— that was my rationale.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the rationale, you see. And yet it's the big corporations that will do something to put you in jail, to where if you steal from an individual, they're less likely to to prosecute him. Yeah, so we've got that upside down. Okay, so this is the place to start with this whole show, or this whole question of who can teach the Dhamma. And the answer to that would be, does he know who he can teach the Dhamma to?

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's a good question. I feel like to ask yourself.

**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker B:** Must be only— you can only answer that on a case-by-case situation.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, absolutely. And so that's what— that's why the Buddha was very selective in who he taught the Dharma to, that he would only teach a little bit of the Dharma. In fact, there's a sutta number— oh, I've forgotten the number now— Udayana, I think it's number 46. And the story is that Upaya went to the Buddha in anger, in pride, that he was going to have a conversation with the Buddha to prove the Buddha wrong. And he wound up getting outsmarted by the Buddha. In fact, the topic was: What causes the most harm? Action, speech, or thought? And the Buddha gave him several examples of the fact that people will have a thought to do harm, but their actions are incomplete. Like somebody who gets a sword, maybe he knows how to use the sword, and he gets really angry and says, "I'm going to kill everybody in the village." Do you think it's possible that he's going to kill everybody in the village? Not likely.

**Speaker B:** Unlikely, but possible.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Okay, it might be possible. How about he's going to kill everybody in the state?

**Speaker B:** All right, the thought can be really blown up, but the action is— but.

**Speaker A:** Your actions are limited based upon reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but the harm that we're doing is still in the thought. And so this is why the Buddha was referring to the mind as the forerunner. And when Upali understood this, He then became a lay follower of the Buddha right then and there. And so the rest of the conversation was getting Upali ready to hear the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path because he was already quite sophisticated through the Jains, through the Naganagaputtas. He was already well skilled in Sila. And in fact, he became the big boss of the Vinaya. Upaya, in his later years as a monk, he became the very best in the rule-keeping system. And so the Buddha would accept him as a student so that he could train him into the noble, because he was well, well established in the ordinary right view. To where Angulimala, he took a different tact with him. But even with Angulimala, there was a reason why Angulimala was out there collecting fingers for his necklace. And that was that his teacher, his priest teacher, the Brahmin, the story goes, The guy who was known as Anagami Mala was in love with the priest's daughter, and the priest didn't want him. And so he says, okay, you bring me 1,000 fingers from 1,000 people you killed, and you can have my daughter. And so he was definitely in wrong view, thinking that he could get away with killing 1,000 people. Until he met the Buddha. But then the Buddha took time to train him. To Virupali, he gave him in one talk because he was ready for it, because he was founded and based in Sila in a solid way. Okay, so this then leads us back to your original question. This is who then can teach the noble Dharma, because we have an awful lot of teachers that are out there teaching ordinary right view under the name of Buddhism. Those are the people who still believe in rebirth, reincarnation, magical powers, and all of that kind of stuff as a prohibitive factor that keeps them in ordinary right view. You can't get away with it. You're going to go to hell if you do that. And so, these are the ones that are out looking for magic, the magic of Buddhism, because actually what's really going on is they want enough power, magical power, so that they can get away with it. Isn't that brilliant? Yeah. Wow. So why would someone want magical power except for some sort of revenge, getting back, showing them, taking power over them, proving that you're a good person after all because you've got magical power?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is actually quite dangerous to teach, maybe in some ways, when you see the intention of someone. Why do they even ask these questions? Because they— what do they really want? Sense of some kind of something they're gaining. They want something. More within themselves to have a sense of opposition, maybe, or something?

**Speaker A:** Well, I have been very lucky, if that's the right word for it, in the sense I've had a lot of people call who are actually ready for the Noble Dharma. They've been well schooled, they've gone to church, they've been good Christians, or at least they've been well trained in the morality of the society so that they're ready to hear the noble Dharma. But a lot of the students that I've had, when they have an opportunity to get away with it, they'll try that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I honestly, I could say I have I could say this openly that many times I have practiced only to do the stupid things I want to do and not have the consequences of doing those stupid things. I feel like that has been actually quite common in this community a little bit. It's like we practice because we still really just want to do the same old things that we get the elation from, but we don't want— we try to avoid the consequences, but eventually the Dukkha becomes apparent. That's the important thing, is that even if we do this, we just more and more see the Dukkha of what we're doing. And eventually I feel like it becomes right view that this is Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** So that's exactly correct. In fact, that's what the training is all about. The training is to be able to recognize Dukkha on the surface. That you don't have to cut the turd open to find it's full of shit. Yeah, you could see the turd at a distance and stay away from it. Just a whiff is all we need. Our smell— just— yeah, that's, that's the wisdom, is that we don't have to spread it all over the walls to find out that it stinks up the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's an interesting analogy. Just how many whiffs is it going to take you to stay away? Just one, or are you going to get real close to it? Are you going to, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly so. And yet in Western Buddhism, they talk about it in the sense that you've really got to spread it all over your walls, you really got to get into it. This is why we have that whole idea of the dark night of the soul.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I read something really terrible on the internet that this person was absolutely convinced he had to go through the dark night. He was looking for the dark night. He was practicing to go into the dark night. I just was like, wow, this is actually harmful. But what— who is teaching someone to do this is actually like destroying another person's experience of life, like causing a huge amount of suffering to someone because this person is convinced, 'I must go through this phase of being absolutely depressed out of my mind to come out of it.' It's crazy. I read that on the internet very recently.

**Speaker A:** Well, the answer would be, if that's the situation you're in, that's a Dark Night of the Soul right then and there. He's already in that dark night of the soul because he's looking for how bad can it get, and it's going to get really bad for him. In fact, it's already bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, but yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the Buddha teaches that the Noble Dharma is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, and there's no room for a dark night of the soul. That the dark night of the soul is when you really do not see the Dukkha as Dukkha. You recognize that turd is dinner.

**Speaker B:** What, wait, what, what do you mean?

**Speaker A:** The Dukkha of, of the turd, the shit, right? We see that as dinner and we eat it. And we want more of it. This guy wants even more and more. He's been eating a bunch of shit and he's still wanting to eat more shit. How much shit can he eat until he really feels bad and really gets sick off of it? And yet the wise man can even take a whip and says, that's not lunch, it's not for consumption.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the real training in Dukkha. Is not how deep can we get into it, but rather can we recognize it at the distance. That training is then in the quality of the wholesome versus the unwholesome thoughts. Can you see that that thought that you're having stinks? If you can, you can change it into something sweet. That you don't have to take that unwholesome thought into action. Yeah, because most of us are still caught in the point that all the action is the danger. I can plan a robbery, I can either go get the equipment for the robbery, but until I start to execute the robbery, I'm not a robber. Okay. And yet now in the law they're saying, oh, if we catch you planning for a robbery, you're a robber. You're still doing something in the name of the robbery. Yeah, so they can't end— but they can't arrest the guy for drawing plans of the bank on a piece of paper or thinking about robbing the bank.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the— just to make clear, the order ordinary view is that this robber in his mind is planning the robbery and is drawing up blueprints and all, and he's getting this feeling, but he knows that yet there's no consequence for that in, in terms of legality or anything. He can't get punished for that.

**Speaker A:** Some places in some law systems, okay, he's got to do it in order for it to count.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but the noble right view is that he is actually in a way punishing himself by having these kinds of thoughts, believing that there's no consequence.

**Speaker A:** Thinking that he can get away with it, actually. So this is the mind, and this is why the Buddha says that the mind is the forerunner of all of our speech, all of our drawing of plans. And so we have that three-phase system. The mind is the forerunner for everything. That you can think about threatening a politician, but if you put an email out, or if you put it on Twitter that you're threatening them, then that's speech. And now in some legal systems, speech in the sense of I'm threatening that I'm going to kill you has consequence, not nearly as much as the actual killing, but it may be enough to send the police around. You might get arrested for threats, but that's going to be what, 30 days? Not an execution, but it still has consequence. This is where the speech is. But the thoughts, anybody can get away with unwholesome thoughts. And in fact, you could go so far as to say that everybody who goes to Las Vegas or some one of these casinos has the thought, "I'm going to be able to figure out something, do it, and get away with it." Except the casino owners are the ones who have already been planning all of that stuff. And so, they're planning for it, and so most of the people who then wind up going to Las Vegas with the idea, the thought to rob, they don't rob. But they're still in Las Vegas losing their money because they had the thought that they could get away with it. So, this is where the Buddha teaches, this is why we teach it at the level that we do, is that number one, thoughts are easy easy to change. Actions, once they've been done, are very hard to undo. Sometimes once you say it, it's still hard to undo it. Sometimes when you say it, you're committed to doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, okay. What would you say— would you say on the verbal, or on the level of action, or on the level of verbal is there a different sense of consequence or Kamma, or, you know, like.

**Speaker A:** A different— Well, that's because of the way that the system is built. The system is built upon if you actually do the robbery, that's the wrong thing. But if you talk about the robbery and make a plan for it, that's also wrong because it leads up to it. But there are no laws on the books that are in fact in the Constitution of the United States under the idea of free speech, it's free thought. That you can think badly and get away with it. And the Buddha is saying in the noble respect, no, you don't get away with it. That your unwholesome thoughts give you unwholesome feelings. And when you have wholesome thoughts, you have wholesome feelings. And if you continue along having wholesome thoughts one after another, after another, that's liberating. And yet a lot of the Buddhist teaching, "Oh, you've got to stop the thoughts." No, you only need to get your thoughts in the place of being liberated. This is why the Buddha says that the first Jhana is the enlightenment. If you can get your mind to the point to having one wholesome thought after another, to another. So now we're looking at, well, what is the teacher then? Is the teacher the one who was trying to get away with it? Is the teacher the one who is trying to teach that he and others can't get away with it because of these conditions, like Kamma machines, heavens, hells, gods, priests? Rules, rituals, laws, cops, military, judo masters, you know, all of this stuff is going to stop people from getting away with it, so therefore they should behave and speak correctly. This is where the ordinary mind is. The ordinary mind to be the ordinary right view or wrong view is that they've got everything upside down, thinking that the danger is in the behavior or that the danger is in the speech, to where the real danger that the Buddha is talking about is in the mind. So if anybody's going to teach the Dhamma of the Buddha, they should be already in that position of knowing that the mind is the forerunner And it's not a concept. People will say that with a knife in their hand, that the mind is the forerunner.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it has to be a real practice. You have to be really— right, you.

**Speaker A:** Have to really, really know it and understand it.

**Speaker B:** That's actually probably the most, uh, common thing happening is someone will say something as a concept, but it's just a different reality. Like, it's not— it's different than practicing it in the concept.

**Speaker A:** Because if you do understand that the mind is the forerunner for all things, that gives you tremendous amount of freedom. One, to avoid wrong behavior and wrong speech is because you've already avoided those things in the mind. Yes, the other one is the liberation, is that with the right mind and the right frame of reference, then your actions can be enormously good. Yeah, well, you can build, and in fact we could help build a society one student at a time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And this is why the Pañña, Samatha, Sila is really important, because once you start feeling wholesome, I feel like it's very— you just naturally do the right thing. Like, it's just easy instead of the rule of you do having to do it. So actually, I would say, I think I see why you teach Pañña, Samatha, Sila, because it's it's just far better off if someone practices like that. It's just, it will have a more long-lasting impact if someone can actually get themselves into it.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's the only way that's liberating, that one has to come out of their ordinary right view, which means where everybody is stuck. They're stuck. Every human being is stuck between the combination of I can't get away with it, yes I can, no you can't get away with it, yes I can.

**Speaker B:** So delusion is really just ignorance, like the delusion of— so delusion of not— the delusion of ordinary view is that there is ignorance to the fact that these thoughts are creating, or these thoughts are harming myself, not understanding that, or whatever I'm doing there is the ignorance, ah, there's actually no result for this because no one is catching me. I have no— I'm getting it. So this is just part of delusion.

**Speaker A:** In a way that, um, precisely so. And part of the delusion for both wrong view and ordinary right view is that actions and behaviors and speech count the most. And the noble Dharma is, no, it's the mind that has to be changed, not your behavior. Sila is all about controlling your mouth and your hands. And it's hard to control the mouth and the hands when the mind is not in control. So the place that we have to really work is getting the mind together, to get it wholesome, to get it away from wanting things and then doing things to get those things that we want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is then where we're looking at, well, what kind of teacher are you looking for? Are you looking for teachers who can give some basic Buddhism, because that's basically all that the Westerners who came to Asia for a short time so many years ago, they didn't stay a monk 5, 10, 20 years. They came a few months, that's all their visas would allow them, and then they go back to the West thinking that they've got the real Dharma, where in fact, they don't. They got some precepts, they got the idea of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, they got the ideas of meditation, mindfulness, and all of this, but it never really dawned upon them that it's the mind that's the only thing that needs to be fixed. And that needs to be fixed during the day, all day long.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so most of the Western teachers are automatically out as being qualified to teach, even if that guy makes a lot of money off of teaching Buddhism and even goes to the point of having his own students, uh, called teachers. He charges them a lot of money, gives them a whole lot of ordinary information. He doesn't teach generosity, he can't teach generosity. The only way that you can teach generosity is by demonstrating it and showing it, and when you charge money for your students, that's not generosity, that's business. So there's a whole lot of stuff within that context where the real Dharma cannot be taught. So, let's look at it from the perspective then of what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, or what would the nobles say about who can teach the Dhamma. The old classical tradition was that someone needed to be fully Srotapanna in order to teach the Dhamma. What does that mean? Fully immersed in the Noble Dharma, that they know it, that they've got personality view down correctly, that they've got Silavata Paramasa down correctly. They know that the self is generated in the mind, as well as all of the rules that we're trying to either keep or break are in the mind. And the mind is also doubtful about whether they can get caught or not. So these are the first 3 fetters that must be broken in order for someone to get into the path, to recognize that Dhamma is the only thing that there is. The knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path is for every step we take, every thought that we have. Every thought that we have, we have to check it. Is this thing worth while having or not. And so this is where the enthusiasm for the Dhamma comes to play. You've got to be on the Dhamma, on the Dharma, on the Dhamma, and be eager for the Dhamma and taking delight in the Dhamma in order for one to then be the Srotapanna, that in fact One could go so far as to say, wait a minute, who would be a monk other than the ones who were really super dedicated to the Dharma? Most people are not ordinary or lay people, they're not ready for the real Dharma, only those that were ordained. And yet in Thailand, there's a whole lot of reasons for ordaining other than I got to have the Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, that's all I care about. Reasons. Yeah, in fact, even for Westerners, there are other reasons for becoming monks, like status, easy life, doing what mommy tells me to do because she's Buddhist and she wants me to be a good Buddhist monk so she can be a big lady in the community, you know, all of that kind of stuff. So there's a lot of reasons for people to become monks, but on the surface If somebody is a monk, that means that they care enough about the Dharma that they would ordain and spend their whole life pursuing the Dharma. And yet most of the people who do ordain are not at that high state. They've ordained for other reasons other than this is the only way to go. So when we're training ordinary people, in the noble Dharma, it begins to occur to them, "Oh, really the easy way out of all of this Dukkha of society, the easy way to change my mind is to go be around others who have changed their mind." And so this is one of the great values of ordaining, is after you've become a Srotapanna enough that you don't care about anything else but the Dhamma. So this is the old standard for who can teach the Dharma. The one who knows it enough and knows that the real teaching of the Buddha is to remove the unwholesome thoughts, because that's where the Dukkha is.

**Speaker B:** But you're saying the old tradition, old standard, you're talking about from the Pali.

**Speaker A:** This is where it— All the way back to the teaching of the Buddha himself, that the ones that he would have as student teachers would be the ones who were really there, eager for the Dhamma. Because a teacher has to be really, really eager for what he's teaching. 'Cause he's gonna be doing it a lot. If you really, really, really, really, really cared about algebra and the only thing that you wanted to do all you care about is math, and they put you in a classroom to teach English, you're not going to be very happy there. But if they give you the teaching job of an algebra teacher, and all you care about is algebra, then maybe you can teach some algebra. You like it, you show the students how much you like it, you love it, and they'll begin to love it too. But bad algebra teachers is the number one reason why we don't have a whole nation full of good algebra people, is because they didn't have good teachers. That's the main problem with Buddhism, and you've heard me tell before that because of AI, because of politics, because of the fall of the church, there's going to be an awful lot of people interested in Buddhism in the next 30 to 40 years, and the amount of teaching that's available to them is minuscule.

**Speaker B:** That's one thing motivating me quite a bit. I can see this big problem going to happen. I feel like I really want to get in this flow and really teach the real Dhamma, what's actually going to help, what works. Well, I guess it's just what works, right? That's just how reality works. What actually is the Logodharma?

**Speaker A:** Okay, now there's another point that we can cover on this, and that is, is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, he takes a different tack to it, that it's not necessarily only the Srotapanna who can teach, but he does make the point that the student teacher, the one who's beginning to teach, must understand Paticcasamuppada.

**Speaker B:** And by understanding it, like, you understand by seeing it as it— like, you understand how the whole 12 links occur all the time.

**Speaker A:** So you are just basically by saying that you understand Paticcasamuppada, the I think the correct, easy definition is that you understand how the mind functions to get us from sensory input into Dukkha, because it's our habits. So when we perceive, we perceive the way that we've always perceived, ignorantly, and that sets us up for going right down the path into not being able to control the feelings, then in fact the feelings control the individual because he didn't recognize that the feelings were actually generated by the mind, and that you can change the way that you feel by changing your mind, to change the way that you perceive things. Yeah, or eventually to stop perceiving altogether and just live in reality. So this is where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is, and that would then mean that anybody who would think that the Paticcasamuppada is the way that it's expressed in the Visuddhimagga, in the sense of 3 lifetimes, that's still ordinary right view. It's not noble, and therefore the person who is teaching that is not teaching the teachings of the Buddha. He may be teaching some good advice, but he's not teaching liberation. So the first thing that makes a good teacher is he knows what he's talking about and that he is sure to make sure that he knows what he's talking about. This is why a good teacher will reference what he's talking about or go try to find a reference for what he's talking about. Rather than, "Oh, this is my Dhamma." Oh no, we got to have a reference for it. Did I hear Bhikkhu Buddhadasa say that? Did I read it in the sutta? Did I get it from Goenka? Where did that stuff come from? Or did I make it up?

**Speaker B:** Yes, actually, when I was reading Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talk about dependent origination, When someone would be at the point of contact, that is where either you have the problem, you have the problem at the point of contact. If you allow that feeling to become the craving and then to become into a new state.

**Speaker A:** Well, the contact, that's like getting shoved, okay? Pasa. When they use the word contact in English language, that's bland. Okay, a better word, better way of saying it is, is that our thoughts and our concepts have impact on us, not just a touch. Sometimes it knocks us down. Yeah, I see that pretty girl across the street and I just get knocked down and I crawl right there Okay, so that whole point then is that this is why we think that we're out of control with our feelings, that I'm angry rather than anger is there. We see ourselves as those feelings. We are the feelings. Yeah, but if you have real understanding of the teaching of Samadhi, you recognize no feelings is just part of the sequence of events.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the things are just occurring in their own nature, dependent theory.

**Speaker A:** Based upon the mind being the forerunner.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So if teaching this kind of thing, it is the language though in a way, because how do you know what language to use? Do you would you always reference Pali? Would you always reference to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, or would you go to a certain analogy? How do you know, depending on each student, if you know these people? Not really understanding Buddhism, you don't just say, "Oh, this is dependent origination, this is what this is." Like, is there a certain creativity, or how do you say it?

**Speaker A:** Well, the Buddha was very big on similes, metaphors, that kind of thing. And the reason for that is because people can understand it through a metaphor. The question is, where does the metaphor come from? Did it come out of the mind of the teacher? Is he trying to make a point in bringing up a simile or an idea, just like I was using the word turd. That's just a metaphor. It's really a stinky mind. And yet we eat those thoughts, we consume them. We think that those unwholesome thoughts— I can get away with it, it's okay for me to have hateful thoughts. I'm not recognizing that the hateful thoughts are affecting me right now. The feelings that I have are because of the hateful thoughts. If I stopped having hateful thoughts and start having loving thoughts, I'd feel differently. And so this is one of the most important points that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is making, is that the person who's going going to be a teacher must understand that the mind comes first, that we have to have wisdom at the point of contact so that we can control our feelings. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was going to say, I would also say that the— I think the real ignorance is you're delighting in Dukkha, like You, like, why have hateful thoughts? Because you're getting something out of it, for sure. Like, you're getting something out of it.

**Speaker A:** But you feel like it's— Revenge, often. We're often getting revenge out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe it's that there's some weird— it's not pleasure, but it's perceived as pleasure, maybe. It's just deluded. It's not understood as Dukkha. So you kind of sense this actually feels good, but you don't understand this is Dukkha, this is pain, this is bad. And then when you do understand that, the only option is to change the thought into the right.

**Speaker A:** Thought.

**Speaker B:** Change your thought.

**Speaker A:** To change our thoughts into the way that we really actually want to feel, because we don't want— nobody that I know of wants to feel afraid. They may want other people to feel afraid of them so that they don't have to feel afraid back. This is why people want power, the power of money, the power of persuasion, the magical powers, whatever the powers are. We think ignorantly that power is going to protect us. Yeah, the reality is, is that it's only your attitude of having power that's going to protect you, not the power itself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, do you usually come up with metaphors and analogies? Like, you're just— it just clicks when it makes sense depending on the student you talk to, you know? Like, you're just You just kind of, kind of, you just do the— you get the best sense of the person you can, and then you're like, this is, this is the right way.

**Speaker A:** Generally, we have a student— teachers generally have their favorite, uh, similes and metaphors and whatever like that, a whole bag full of them. And then we'll pick one up at a time and keep applying it and applying it over and over again. And eventually, uh, yet another metaphor And then the students will see it, then it'll click.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, you don't want to even bring out your best guns first, but also kind of want to soften them up before you go in for the final blow.

**Speaker B:** What do you mean by soften them up?

**Speaker A:** Like you're softening them up with metaphors? And stories and getting them into listening and wondering and collecting things together. And then you'll hit them with an analogy and they'll say, 'Oh, I see!' Because I've seen you do that. That's the best part of being a teacher, is to see the students wake up on the spot.

**Speaker B:** So it's like talking to a child and then talking to an adult in a way, like you're you're first getting them very engaged, like into a story, and then you're introducing the hard hitter, the more— this is what I'm trying to say kind of thing. I mean, like that.

**Speaker A:** And this is part of the reason why it has to be repeated over and over and over again in so many different ways, is because we have to get through all of that views that the students have, their concepts, the way that things are supposed to be, as well as the fact that everything that we're talking about here is a middle path. And that almost always, if you're at one extreme and you look at the other extreme, what's going to cloud your view is the people in the middle. And so you'll automatically think that they're in the extreme because they're in the middle. For instance, if they say don't do A, don't do A, don't do A, then because we're looking down that don't, don't do A, that means at all we should do B because B is behind the don't do A, the A where I am. So they go to the opposite extreme. Easy example of that would be when we say, "Have wholesome thoughts, have happy feelings," the guy says, "Oh, if I did that all the time, I'd never get out of bed." You see, he goes from one extreme to the other, thinking that the only reason why he ever gets out of bed is because he's got to deal with unwholesome stuff. Rather than the fact that he can get out of bed to do some wholesome stuff. Nobody wants to stay in bed all the time unless you're physically incapable of getting up out of the bed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I guess on that, that page, you could say also Sati, that you should always have Sati and if you don't, if you forget, the extreme is like punishing yourself or something like, or just forgetting about, just like, "I can't do this, I'm not, this is not working.".

**Speaker A:** Because— If we don't remember to look and we're not looking, then when unwholesome thoughts come up, we're not seeing those as unwholesome thoughts. We're not seeing the Dukkha. We're only seeing what we want and say, oh, I'll get away with it. If I can get what I want, everything's going to be hunky-dory. And getting what we want is not hunky-dory because things don't last. We have to retrain the mind into the wholesome. So this is the place where a student would then be ready to teach the Dharma is when he already understands that. So there's also a sutta that talks about 5 ways to learn the Dharma, and the beginning ways would be listening to a teacher. And then chanting and reflecting on the chanting, or maybe reading a Dharma book would be our modern-day substitution for the chanting. And then discussing it with other students, and then mulling it over, figuring it out, keeping our mind focused on the Dhamma until it sinks in. Yeah, and then the fifth way is teaching, so that once someone's gone through all of those other four steps and really has the Dhamma sinking in, then the way to cement it in place is by teaching it, because everybody who comes to teaching wants to know that that what they're teaching is correct, and they care about it. So a budding teacher is going to be reinforcing that he knows the Dhamma. The budding teacher is the one who is reading the most suttas. The budding teacher then is the one, in fact you could go so far as to say, Budding teacher is also the budding Sotapanna.

**Speaker B:** Can you give me another word for budding?

**Speaker A:** Um, on the way to— okay, okay, like a bloom, a flower blooms out of a bud.

**Speaker B:** Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so someone who is on their way to being the Sotapanna means that now the way that they get to be a Srotapanna is by immersing themselves into the Dhamma. And a way that a teacher is going to become a teacher is because he's immersing himself in the very same Dharma. This is why then a full Srotapanna, and I mean full Srotapanna in the sense of both the path of the Sotapanna and the fruit of the Sotapanna, those guys make the best teachers. And he gets even better at teaching as he eliminates his own defilements.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so it seems that teaching itself is— I mean, it's simultaneously obviously a consequence of practicing well, but it's also a skill in itself to teach. Like, it requires its own separate practice in a way. Like, you have to practice teaching. It's not— you can't just practice the path and expect that you can teach the Dhamma, that you also have to practice the teaching of Dhamma. But it all obviously goes hand in hand because you couldn't begin teaching unless you practice well the path.

**Speaker A:** Well, that whole mulling it over means that there's where you're really teaching yourself.

**Speaker B:** Can you get it? Sorry, can you give me another word for mulling?

**Speaker A:** Mulling it over means thinking about it.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, going repetitive, repetitively going over it, right?

**Speaker A:** Going over it and over it and over it. That in fact, this is the part of the sutta In the last part, in the Dhammanakkaya part of the Satipatthana Sutta, number 10, it talks about, well, what are you going to have in your mind? And the first part of that part of the sutta is hindrances. And so the first action that we do is see a hindrance as a hindrance and throw it out. As a hindrance. So what are we going to do when we're free of hindrances? What do you want to think about when you're not thinking about any of the stuff that you want or any of the things you want to get rid of? You're not thinking about work to do, you're not thinking about the past, you're not thinking about the future. What is there to think about? What would be noble enough to think about?

**Speaker B:** Sharing that state, I guess. That would be fun.

**Speaker A:** I think the easy answer, I've already set it up for you, is the noble Dharma is what we spend our time thinking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now one of the things that we would think about then with a noble mind is the five aggregates. I am not this body, I am not these feelings, I am not the way I look at things, perception, I am not my memory systems, and I'm not even the input. I'm not consciousness, I am not perception, I am not Sankhara, I am not Vedana, I am not Kaya, I am not those things. What am I? That's the wrong question. Instead of asking the question, "What am I?" the right question to ask is, "Is this Dukkha? Have I gone back into the hindrances?" That's the question. If I'm asking, "Who am I?" that's out of doubt.

**Speaker B:** Well, remember I was telling you about Ramana Maharshi and the His whole practice was, who am I? Like, you have to focus on the—.

**Speaker A:** Very Hindu, his name. Is that true also of him? Because that's what the Hindus do. That's why the Buddha was so big in that second sutta, the Sabba Asapa Sutta number 2 in the Mahayana, is because that's the wrong question to ask. You'll never get any satisfaction. That's like saying, what's in this book? Book, and it's a notebook. The pages keep changing. I rewrite it, I throw that page out, and I put this page in, and I go to a new topic, and I put some pages in about that, and then they get old and I throw them out. So asking, "Who am I?" is asking, like, what's in a notebook that's dynamic. It doesn't have a particular answer. The answer is only true for a short period of time, but once we get an answer, we'll cling to that answer, that's what we call a concept. A concept is nothing but answers that we've made up for situations that have already changed by the time that we come up with the new answer. But there are things that are in fact pretty solid. They don't change much. This is what makes the Dhamma noble is that the noble Dharma that the Buddha taught is still enforced today. And it will be enforced whether Putin wins or not, whether Xi keeps in the CCP, or whether Australia sells coal, it doesn't matter. The Dharma is still the Dharma. It's noble. And for that reason, that's what we want to have in our mind. That's what we want to think about. We want to think about the Noble Dhamma, the Five Aggregates, the Four Noble Truths. Now, this is actually quite different, but this is the way of— than the Anapanasati Sutta, but this is a way of thinking about it is that when we are thinking about the noble Dharma and the liberation that it gives, you're having wholesome thoughts. This is what I meant by mulling it over, thinking about the Dharma, recognizing that you can see the Dharma in everything that happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everywhere you look, there's where you don't— your noble Dharma is to be found. That's why the mind then gets, um, enthusiastic about seeing the Dharma everywhere, and the mind becomes noble because it does see the the Dharma everywhere, because that's what we're looking for. This is what's worthy of having in our minds. This is the Noble Dharma, the Eightfold Noble Path. Thinking about it— oh, wake up, take a look, make a change. Keep thinking about that over and over again. That'll help us in fact actually wake up, is by thinking about Waking up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess the mulling is the key. The mulling is just endless mulling, mulling.

**Speaker A:** Mulling, mulling, keeping the mind in a wholesome state. Uh, Ajahn Samatha uses the word reflecting, and I'm using the word mulling, but it's the same thing. You got the Dhamma on the brain. Now, one point is kind of curious. This is from Socrates. Socrates was actually in talks about what is learning. Because you see, the way that our educational system is taught is that taking it in, reading the Koran, listening to the teacher, taking it in, taking it in, taking it in. But Socrates says, no, that's not learning. You don't learn something until you can put it out, you can reproduce it. You might be able to watch an algebra teacher draw something on the blackboard and you say, I understand, and he'll give you that same question on the pop quiz and you miss it. Because you really didn't understand it. So this is why we have to do the examples at the end of the chapters of math books, but we also have to practice what the Dharma teaches. And how do we practice that? Is by keeping it on the mind. Mulling it over, repeating it to ourselves, bringing it up, inspecting it, looking at it, seeing if this sutta fits in with that sutta, seeing the consistencies, all of that kind of stuff. And we begin to get not just enthusiastic, we get delighted with the Dhamma because it works. It's magnificent. The way that it works. Secure to every human being's problems.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's been that way for many, many centuries. The Noble Dharma may have not been known, but the Noble Dharma was real long before the Buddha. He even says it in the sense of, I've discovered an old ancient path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what was it? So two monks that have seen the ancient path or something?

**Speaker A:** Well, it doesn't matter that you know the path. The point is that you've got to stand on it, you got to walk on it, you got to pound on it, you got to be in it, you got to be on the path moment by moment, thinking about the Dhamma, because that's the path. And when one is able to do that, one is very close to being a teacher. It's the only thing they care about. The Dhamma means that the only thing that comes out of their mouth is Dhamma. He's already a teacher because that's all he cares about, but he'll get better and better at teaching. Because he's practicing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have this sense of you have to practice teaching quite a bit.

**Speaker A:** But you can only practice what you know, because this practice is putting it back out, putting it out. Someone can read the score of music They might even be able to hum it. If they can hum it, they're putting it back out. Or you can take that score and sit down at a piano and you can work it out so that you can actually put it back out. That's the learning, is the reproduction of it, not the input. And that's why the mind is the forerunner, even for all the unwholesome stuff that people do, is because because they're mulling it over in their mind. They think about it. Yeah, I'm going to go get that cash, I'm going to rob that store, I'm going to go do this, I'm going to do that. It never works out the way that they think it will because it's ordinary stuff, completely, completely controlled by the cause and effect relationships. Once we know the cause and effect relationships, we can tell that which is beyond most of the causality. Like the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path is kind of beyond causality. That in fact, Paticcasamuppada, to be able to understand dependent origination, we become free from being originating all the time, continually coming up with something new because we were pushed into it.

**Speaker B:** What was the line the Buddha said when this is my last rebirth, or this is my last, or I have arrived, this is my last?

**Speaker A:** Ah, right. If you— that's a very interesting way of saying it. I don't know whether it was cultural at the time, but it's actually the easy way out. Once you understand there is no such thing as rebirth, like reincarnation, then wouldn't it be a natural, easy thing to say is, I'm not going to be born like that again? Because you're not. You'd have full confidence of, I'm not going to be reborn, and I'm just not going to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But then there is the other side of that, and that is that we can also say, I'm not going to be born into Dukkha. I'm not going to try to take revenge when someone tries to hurt me, insult me, or whatever like that. I don't have to get any revenge. I don't have to get back. I don't have to teach them a lesson. I don't have to be reborn into that revengeful position and let it go. So that's the higher way of saying that takes a whole lot more confidence than say I'm not going to get reborn again, knowing that you're talking about life after life kind of rebirth. But it takes some oomph to say I'm not going to go get mad anymore. I'm not going to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it does take some, you know, like, you know that you will, you will not go into that new mindset of Anicca. You just know, like, that must be quite a— I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I've had enough of of it. Enough already, not going there now. And so that's the kind of confidence that we have. And so it's at two levels. The first level is obvious, easy enough. I'm not going to be reborn again. But those people who believe in rebirth, they can't say that about themselves because they don't know, they're unsure.

**Speaker B:** I'll say something kind of strange. You know, when I'm mentioning Prajna, Bhikkhuni here at the temple, one of our last conversations, he said this. He said, I don't want to be an Arahant in this life. So he said he's happy to just be— he's happy to be reborn again in the next life because he knows he will be, he will have a good life in the next life. He'll have a good family, good surroundings, and he will continue on his path. He said, I know that I don't want to be an Arahant in this life. I don't want to go into Nibbana in this life, something like that. All right, what do you think about that?

**Speaker A:** Well, this is part of what the Mahayana talk about, is the Bodhisattva Bhikkhuni, the ideal.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think he's influenced a lot by Mahayana and a lot of Zen too.

**Speaker A:** He's really— okay, so let's look at that for a moment, and that is that we do care enough about these humans out there that we're willing to teach. An Arahant, he don't give a flying rip about humanity. Let them go do what they want to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so it's the Bodhisattva up through not just the Srotapanna and the Sotagami, but even for the Anagami, the one thing that he still cares about is helping people. He can see the Dukkha. So the Arahant, he can't see Dukkha. He's gotten rid of it all. And so instead of saying, I, uh, that, you know, the whip of the Dukkha, the, uh, the turd, that's all of those ordinary people out there. He didn't want to have anything to do with them. They stink. And there's a whole lot of them that, that are called the Paticca Buddha, which means that they don't teach at all. They don't care about teaching. They've got their liberation, they have pulled the ladder up after them, because they don't want anybody climbing on that ladder. People on the ladder stink, so we pull up the ladder. You don't deal with them, don't try to teach them, don't try to help them, stay away from them. So the Arahants are few and far far between because almost all of us have to get to that state, stay in the state just beyond that, and that is the only thing that I really care about is helping other people. Because I've already got everything I need for myself. And so this is what they mean by the Bodhisattva ideal, but the point of it is that Because these things are states that are movable rather than fixed places. Maitreya could be an Arahant all afternoon, but in the morning he's out there helping people. And it's from that position he says, I do not want to get into the position to where I don't help anybody. No, I want to stay in the position of helping people. So almost then, on the other side of that, almost all of them who claim that they are enlightened, who claim that they are Arahants, aren't. Because if they were, then they wouldn't be out there advertising that they are. They're out advertising because they really don't have it. They want to be looked up to as if they did have it by ordinary people. Ummi-dummi, Gabby-gabby, oh, he's a great big teacher, oh, he's a guru, oh, he's something special. And then these guys, they love all of that kind of attention. That's where a lot of the teachers then will wind up because they haven't really come through that Dukkha and are free from it. So the Anagami, the teacher, is, I'm free from Dukkha for myself, and if I would get away from all of those people, I'd never have any Dukkha. But I am going to have a bit because I am going to deal with those people because they deserve the same breaks that I got. I can't pull up that ladder.

**Speaker B:** What is a choice? Basically, it's a choice not to just—.

**Speaker A:** It'S an absolute choice. Just like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa teaches, we've got choices here. And just like you're thinking, and just like my tree is thinking, and just like I'm thinking, hey, we've We've got work to do here. We've got a whole generation of people to save. Knowing that we can't do it, we're going to be out there doing it anyway. Can't save everybody. And in fact, going back to that point, if you try to save somebody when they're not ready to be saved, you're going to destroy the best parts of them. Because the best parts of them are ordinary right view that's based upon, oh, I can't get away with it, I should refrain from doing it. And if we teach the Dharma to them in the wrong way, then they'll say, oh, I can get away with it now, oh, I'm noble now, oh, I'm enlightened, I'm going to go put that down on my paper, publish it in a book, advertise it all over Google or whatever that I'm an Arahant, when in fact you're not. They're still wanting something to be called an Arahant. Did you freeze? Are you still there, or are you coming back? Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, you're back.

**Speaker A:** So one of the things that we can say then is that individuals—.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, can you refresh your camera? Can you turn your camera on and off?

**Speaker A:** And I— what?

**Speaker B:** It's on and off.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, your internet has gone suddenly bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's see if it's going to be okay now, because the point that I'm making is, is that most people don't know enough about the Dhamma to know what makes a good teacher. They become teachers because they want to be teachers. They want to be teachers. They want the fame, the name, all the benefits that comes with it, including for many people they see teaching the Dharma as a meal ticket. That in fact, I even saw on Reddit one time where a woman would say, well, they've got to eat. The answer to that is, if they're really ready to teach the Dharma, they're not hungry. They don't need to eat. What they need is to teach the Dharma, because that's what they're wanting to do. And if you say, "Oh, they need to eat," that means that they're now a teacher that is trying to turn the Dharma into a meal ticket, and he's not really ready to teach the Dharma. So how does a person know when they're ready to teach the Dharma? The answer to that is, is that that's up to the nobles, because they're the ones who can see whether you're ready to teach the Dharma or not. And you'll know for sure that they think you're ready to teach the Dharma because they'll put you in a position where you have no choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I remember you told I think you talked about how Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would put you on the spot, or maybe it was Ajahn Poh, I don't know, but he put you on the spot.

**Speaker A:** The person who put you on the spot, but Ajahn Poh did it on a regular basis.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay. And that's the— that's— yeah, yeah, actually, wow, I think that would be the real test. Of, uh, yeah, that would be quite a good test to talk, to teach when you're immediately put on the spot and you have no way of getting into your head so much about preparing huge amounts of intellectual stuff, right?

**Speaker A:** Do you know it or not? Yeah, yeah, you know it, you can put it right back out there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have got a good sense of mulling. Well, from this talk, I've got a good sense of mulling it over.

**Speaker A:** Mulling over— Anicca, Anagami, having wholesome thoughts about the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's step number 4. We have to do it a lot. We can no longer reside on the teaching or the suttas or on our chanting or on the books. We got to know it. So thinking about the Four Noble Truths over and over and over again until it really clicks. You know the Four Noble Truths, you know the Eightfold Noble Path. Which is a bit different than, you know, that the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path work because it's proven to you that it works. That's step 3. We're talking about steps 6 and 7 now on the path, and these steps that I'm talking about are actually referred to as knowledges. The third knowledge is the doubt about what is and what is not the path, and we know it because we practice it, we've done it, but we're still not ready to teach it. That's when we mull it over and we get it down solid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's step 6. And 7, when we're delighting in the Dhamma, we just can't shut up about it. That's all we want to talk about.

**Speaker B:** I, I would shut up about it if people around me started to get put off by that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— maybe you're looking at the details. We're talking about a middle path here. That's all you care about. So you go find somebody else to talk to the Dhamma, talk about the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Are you thinking? Yeah, you'll think about something, you'll mull something over, you figure out something, and then you've got to go tell somebody. And the best person to go tell is your teacher because you trust him. And when you get that feedback from him that yes, that's correct, Then you can mull it over some more, get it down right again, and start saying it out loud. And so really what we're talking about is who is qualified to be a teacher of the Dharma is someone who is deeply in the process of living it. If that's what they care about. And a great part of that then has to do, going back to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's position, understanding how the mind works. Understanding that we invent things, we conceptualize things, and that's what contacts us and gives us feelings. Not the reality, but our views of reality, our concept of reality is what influences us. And our influences come from our past. And so if we can see things, reality as it is, and we keep looking at it the way that it is now rather than relying upon what we've learned in the past to make sense out of it. Now, me personally, I'm not sure whether just understanding the Paticcasamuppada is enough, the way Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says it is. But in fact, it looks more to me like that eagerness that we're talking about. Do we have to be eager to know the Dharma, to teach the Dharma, to to think about the Dhamma, to live the Dhamma. That's what makes a good Dhamma teacher, is when that's the only thing he cares about.

**Speaker B:** I guess you have two positions. Like, if you find, like, let's say you find like a gold vein, like a bunch of gold.

**Speaker A:** In a rock.

**Speaker B:** Vein in the mountain, and you struck gold, you can either bring it back and tell everyone Or you can just not, you know, you could just practice the Dharma and never talk, really never be eager to speak to about anyone.

**Speaker A:** Or— but that was the first thing that happened with the Buddha after he became enlightened. He says, this is too stuff, this is too difficult, nobody's going to understand it. And then his next thought would be, wait a minute, I had some really, really good teachers. I bet they would understand it. And then his next thought after that was, yeah, but they're all dead. But that led it open. If his teachers could understand it, that means that there will be others that understand it, that he didn't stay in that position of nobody will get this. And that has in fact been quite rare throughout history, how many people have in fact become self-enlightened. About the only one that even gets on stage for qualification in our lifetimes would be Eckhart Tolle, and he's suspicious. We have some in the past like Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, a lot of the old Greeks, if you're curious what his name was. There's also the issue of Jesus, because everything that Jesus said agreed with what the Buddha taught. But then Jesus's action in the temple was suspicious.

**Speaker B:** I can say one thing. I met one person in my life who I would personally regard as very, very highly, definitely in a very interesting state, but he never talks about enlightenment or any spirituality. All he does is like raise money for charity and build all of these. All he does is like this, like projects and he doesn't talk about ever about East He's just dead, like he's just, he sometimes says something very, very minutely about, he would just like utter something like, I'm just, I asked him one time, are you enlightened? He just said, I just feel very present, like he doesn't talk about enlightenment or anything, he just said, I feel very present.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because he's not trained in that language.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he's not— he never had the spiritual journey of the Eastern, Eastern traditions.

**Speaker A:** Well, you don't know what journey he's been on. Yeah, he's not talking about it. Then in fact, he really doesn't even care about the journey he's been on. What he's interested in now is helping people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very interesting.

**Speaker A:** Anyway, which means he doesn't have his own problems anymore. The only problems he has is problems of helping others.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's pretty much what it seems like.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the part that's good in the middle. The good in the beginning is when you begin to understand the Dharma. The good in the middle is when you're out there doing good. And then the good in the end is when you forget about helping other people because you've got it. And in fact, the number of Arahants are so few that we can say we really don't need them.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Once we got the spark, once the Buddha has said that he's going to go teach, he's been able to spread it. And it's not the Arahants that spread the Noble Dhamma, it's the ones who are learning it by practicing it— the Srotapannasati, the Sotagamis, the Anagamis.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** They'Re the ones that are doing all the work of helping humanity. And if they're really good teachers, they do not teach a person such that they fall back into wrong view, but they're lifted out of ordinary right view into a noble right view. There is also, by the way, one more danger that's worth noting, and that is not only are those— there are people who would fall out of right, ordinary right view into wrong view when they hear the noble Dharma. There are also a group of people, I would say a huge number, not a vast majority, but a huge number of Western Buddhists, who when they hear the Noble Dharma, they refuse it. They say, "No, it's dangerous. You can't talk that way, because you will create an awful lot of wrong view. You must teach ordinary Dharma, because teaching Noble Dharma, is dangerous. You could go so far as then to say that's what the Brahmins really had against the Buddhists. They wanted to kill them and wipe them out because they couldn't stand that there was a whole group of people who didn't give a flying rip about the Brahmins. And in fact, you could go so far as to say that this is the whole point of the Vasudhi Magga. That Arhat— excuse me, Buddhagosa— he knew the noble Dharma and he twisted it so as to make it difficult for people to get. Because if he— if people could get the noble Dharma easily, his family wouldn't make all the money they make by doing all the ceremonies they do. And so ordinary people will call nobles lazy, layabouts, do-nothings. They'll find all the derogatory things to say about them in order to hold on to their position of being the boss, being in charge, making the rules.

**Speaker B:** Well, the noble Dharma seems to be a threat to the current structures of the ordinary society, you know, like Anicca.

**Speaker A:** It is, absolutely.

**Speaker B:** So I mean, in that sense it is kind of dangerous, you know, like a bunch of people individuating from a collective. Structure. It is in a sense dangerous like that.

**Speaker A:** So look at— let's look at it from that position then. In a culture like Thai culture that hold the monks as very high, very spiritual, magical beings, that kind of stuff, worthy of respect and all of that.

**Speaker B:** Kind of stuff, worthy of offerings, worthy.

**Speaker A:** Of respect, worthy— right. Or the other way of looking at it is, oh, they're just a bunch of layabouts. They know better than to get wrapped up with all the stuff of the world, and so they don't get bothered to wrap up in all the world. Again, the Thai people wouldn't see the monks as so special, so holy, and so that whole magical holiness kind of air that in fact Ajahn Po taught that to me in a way. He would say, "You're a monk now." You're a Bhikkhu. That means that you're better than everybody else. There is only one person in the kingdom that you have to pay respect to as being better than you are, and that's the king. But everybody else is just an ordinary human being, and you're special. You're a monk now. You got to live up to the standards of being a monk.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the standards are not the standards of the Sila. It's not a standard of behavior, it's the standard of the mind. The standard is Dukkha, Nirodha, Freedom. Freedom from all the cares of the world. Why do people stay busy and active and work and all of that? It's because they're wrapped up with all the cares of the world. If you don't care about the world, there's nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** For some reason, when you say that, I just perceive it in a way that I'm trying to understand. Like you've said, if you don't care about the world, there's nothing to do.

**Speaker A:** But you can care about the world because in fact all of those people out there that are suffering, the reason they're suffering is because they do care about the world.

**Speaker B:** Or maybe they care about the wrong things, like caring about the wrong things in the world, like nothing's— not each other, the people, but a bunch of just stuff like entertainments and food. Just too much, too much caring about unwholesome stuff.

**Speaker A:** All the wrong things. There's a song about it, looking for love in all the wrong places, looking for love. And so that's what society is, if you're out there looking for love in all the wrong places. And so the right thing to do then is to look for love inside until you figure out you don't need love, to stop looking for love. You don't need it. You're okay without it. But we did— but that's deep because we do love. And what do we love and care about? All of the people who are looking for love in all the wrong places. So we want to stop for a while and teach them to look for love in the right place so that they begin to understand they don't need love at all. This is back to that point about the Buddha made that choice of nobody's going to understand this. This is too much. To set my mouth shut and sit here and enjoy the rest of my life. But he didn't. He says, oh, there are many people with just a little dust in their eyes. I think it's a phrase that he used.

**Speaker B:** Say that again. There are just many people who have.

**Speaker A:** Little dust in their eyes.

**Speaker B:** And would you say those are devas? When I see deva in the suttas, a deva is someone with very little dust in his eyes or here around.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** High quality people.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Well, just to let you know, Prajna Maitreya said that what he said that there is a deva in the temple, this is the magical deva or the.

**Speaker A:** Deva How about a metaphorical deva that he talks about as if it were a magical deva? But it's really not a metaphorical deva.

**Speaker B:** No, no, he's saying that there is a deva in this wat that's been here for many years, and sometimes he contacts the deva, and the deva kicks people out who shouldn't be there and stuff like this.

**Speaker A:** So he's talking about it in magical terms. But he's actually saying a metaphor, that there is something nice about this. What?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that the people that come, the ones that shouldn't be here, they always leave, and the ones that are meant to be here are meant to be here, or something like that.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, which has been true in that regard.

**Speaker A:** It's he that's the deva.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Jesus says something very similar as well about planks in the eye or something.

**Speaker A:** So it is absolutely noble and ordinary to speak in that— in the kind of language that people will understand, even if it's magical language.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think Thai people, they more understand the magical thinking. It works for them.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's true because it comes out of childhood, which means it comes out of every generation across all cultures. Every little child starts thinking magically. Little girls play with dolls thinking they're the mommy. Every boy pushes a little toy truck around saying zoom zoom, thinking that he actually has a big truck. As children, we start off in magical thinking and we remain in magical thinking until we become noble. That's what ordinary right view is, it's a magical point of view. You can't get away with it. The reality is, is that it depends upon how you define getting away with it. If you think that you're completely free and get away with it, nope, that didn't happen. You always have to pay for what you're doing. You worry when you're shoplifting. You're angry when you're shoplifting. And you don't have that really high-quality state of walking into a store and reminiscing, I used to shoplift and I don't do that anymore, I'm above it now. Now that's a better way to feel, right? But the guy who's still shoplifting, he doesn't have that high-quality noble thought. He's still caught in maybe I'll get caught, maybe I want 'Oh, I deserve this because of all the problems I've had in the world.' 'That store is such a ripoff, their prices are too high. They need to be robbed from time to time just to make it even.' And all those kind of thoughts, you see, and we have them. Everybody has those kind of thoughts. The question is, can you come to the point of not having those thoughts and having the thought of I don't shoplift anymore. I'm above that. I don't do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you could do that for every single unwholesome thing you've ever got caught up in. Like, oh, I don't do that anymore. Oh, I see that now. I don't have to do that.

**Speaker A:** I see that. I don't have to do that anymore. Oh, I'm not going to be reborn. It's the same thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wow. I'm not going to do that. That's a higher mind. That's, that's the noble position of I'm above that. I don't do that kind of stuff. I'm better than that. Been there, done that. No more. Enough already. Finish. And so that's the kind of attitude then that would be best for a teacher to have, is that noble attitude that I'm above this, I don't do that kind of stuff, because he is the one who can help the ordinary person come to that position of having given up all the stuff that they still want so that they can truly be satisfied. This is good enough.

**Speaker B:** I feel like just after this talk, I have to contemplate a little bit more than I am right now.

**Speaker A:** Like, just keep— yeah, why is this good? Watch this thing several times, gain some insight. Yeah, because the noble path is the noble path of the teacher, and the teacher's path, when it's noble, it's the noble path. You can't help but become a teacher, but that too is a phase. That too shall pass.

**Speaker B:** I don't know why you have this. I don't know why the trajectory is to teach. Like, it just seems natural in a way, like you have to do this for a time, you know? Like, it's weird. I don't know why. Seems to be normal with most people anyway who practice Dhamma. Like, they just start teaching it, because it just seems like you have to do it. It's like part of life, you have to give back.

**Speaker A:** You have to give it back. It actually is not back, it's forward. You have to pay it forward. You could in fact say that one of the reasons why girls really want to have babies is so that they could pay the baby for paying mom back. Mom gave us life, it's our duty now to give life.

**Speaker B:** I think that's the ordinary duty to the Dharma in a way, you know, in a sense.

**Speaker A:** Well, the Dharma is real, and what I just talked about, that's real. It's real instincts, it's real society, it's real. Paying it forward is real. We do owe our mom and our dad, but the only way that we can pay them back is paying it into the future, not paying it back into the past. So you can, just like I, you cannot pay back Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. For what you've gotten from me. In fact, you can't even pay me back.

**Speaker B:** I think I owe you way more. I don't think I could pay you back.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. But you can pay it forward so that someday you will have friends who see you in the same way that, "Oh, I couldn't possibly pay Kessel back." Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S the real gratitude. You see that in the Bible some places, like the guy who owed 10,000 talents to the king, and he prayed to the king and asked the king whatnot, and the king forgave him. And then the story is, is that he went out and people owed him money, and he demanded them 'Oh, you owe me 1,000, you must pay me 1,000,' even though the king has just forgiven him for 10,000. And when the king found out about that, he revoked his 10,000 baht gift, or a talent gift. 'No, you have to pay me because you didn't learn anything. If you had been gracious and grateful to me, then you would have been generous to those that owe you. And so that's paying forward. You can't pay it back, you gotta pay it forward. The gratitude becomes generosity that we don't give back, we give it out to others, we pay it to other people. We pay it forward to younger people. Someday I'm going to be dead and you're going to be an old man, and there you are teaching the Dharma, paying it off, paying off your debt by paying it forward, that debt of gratitude. And I'm still grateful to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. I still owe him. A debt you can't pay off correctly. It's too much fun to keep paying it. And so that would be another quality of a good teacher, is that he's out there teaching because he owes.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** He has to teach. Out of a sense of gratitude. He's being generous out of a sense of gratitude rather than out of the sense of, oh, I own the Dharma now, it's mine. You never hear me say that. When people try to dump it on me, oh, I hear your teaching— not my teaching, sorry, it's not mine, I'm just passing it along. I got it from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but I know where he got it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not mine. It's not my realization.

**Speaker A:** Not my Dharma. Not my enlightenment. Not mine.

**Speaker B:** It's— wow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, why don't we finish now? I think that we've pretty well covered it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let's finish. I feel satisfied with what I've heard.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, I feel like I need to rewatch this though, because, um, well, yeah, I should.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to hear that you're satisfied. That's also part of the sutras where the After the Buddha finishes, the monk says, yeah, we like this one. Satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Kat, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you soon.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. TTFN. Yeah, ta-ta for now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, ta-ta for now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (primarily Speaker B), explores the question: **Who can and should teach the Dhamma?**

The discussion unfolds through several key themes and conclusions:

### **Core Framework: Three Levels of View**
1.  **Wrong View:** The belief that one can harm others or oneself and "get away with it" to get what one wants. This is the root of criminality and much societal suffering.
2.  **Ordinary Right View:** The conventional, societal morality taught to children. It's based on rules, laws, police, and (often) **magical thinking** (e.g., karma as cosmic justice, heavens/hells, rebirth) to enforce good behavior with the idea "you can't get away with it." Most of society and much of institutional Buddhism operates here.
3.  **Noble Right View:** The liberating understanding taught by the Buddha. It sees that the true danger and the source of freedom is **in the mind itself**, not merely in actions. Unwholesome thoughts *are* the immediate punishment (creating dukkha), and wholesome thoughts *are* the immediate reward (creating peace). This view moves beyond magical thinking to direct cause and effect in the present moment.

### **The Central Problem in Teaching**
*   Teaching the Noble Dhamma to someone not ready is **dangerous**. If a person grounded only in shaky ordinary view hears that the mind is primary, they may misinterpret it as license to act on unwholesome desires ("I can get away with it in my mind"), thus falling into **Wrong View**.
*   The Buddha was highly selective (e.g., with Upāli, Aṅgulimāla) and only taught the full path to those well-established in **Sīla** (morality), which is the foundation of ordinary right view.
*   Many modern teachers, especially in the West, often teach **ordinary right view dressed as Buddhism** (emphasizing rituals, magical rebirth, cosmic karma) because it's safer and more marketable. Some may even seek "magical powers" from practice to ultimately "get away with" having power over others.

### **The Qualities of a True Dhamma Teacher**
1.  **Understands the Mind as the Forerunner:** This is not just an intellectual concept but a lived reality. They know that all dukkha and liberation originate in the mind's thoughts.
2.  **Has Begun the Noble Path Themselves:** Ideally, they are at least a **Sotāpanna** (stream-enterer) or are firmly on the path. This means they have:
    *   Weakened identity view.
    *   Overcome doubt in the Dhamma.
    *   Let go of attachment to rites and rituals (i.e., magical thinking).
3.  **Understands Dependent Origination (Paṭiccasamuppāda):** Not as a theory of past/future lives, but as the real-time process of how sensory contact, through ignorant perception, leads to craving and dukkha **now**.
4.  **Is Eager and Delights in the Dhamma:** Teaching comes from a natural overflow of their practice. They "mull over" the Dhamma constantly. As Dhammarato states, teaching is the fifth way of learning—cementing understanding by putting it out.
5.  **Teaches from Gratitude, Not Ownership:** A true teacher doesn't claim the Dhamma as "theirs." They are paying forward a debt of gratitude to their own teachers (e.g., Bhikkhu Buddhadasa). Their motivation is generosity, not fame, status, or a "meal ticket."
6.  **Uses Skillful Means:** They employ similes, metaphors, and tailor teachings case-by-case. They "soften up" students with stories before delivering deeper points, always aiming to lift students from ordinary to noble view.
7.  **Embodies the "Good in the Beginning, Middle, and End":** The path is joyful, not a "dark night of the soul." A good teacher guides one to recognize dukkha from a distance (like smelling a turd) rather than wallowing in it.

### **Key Conclusions & Insights**
*   **Who can you teach?** A teacher must discern this **case-by-case**, based on the student's grounding in Sīla and ordinary right view.
*   **The Real Training:** Is in **changing thoughts**, not just controlling actions. Wholesome thoughts naturally lead to wholesome actions and well-being.
*   **The Teacher's Path:** Is often a **Bodhisattva-like choice**. While an Arahant might be fully free, those on the path (Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmi, Anāgāmi) often choose to keep teaching out of compassion, helping others even though it means engaging with the dukkha of the world.
*   **The Danger of Institutional Buddhism:** Systems that profit from ceremonies and promote magical thinking (like the Visuddhimagga's three-lives model of dependent origination) may actively suppress the Noble Dhamma because it threatens their authority and economic model.

In essence, **a true Dhamma teacher is one who lives the Noble Path, understands the primacy of the mind, and out of gratitude and compassion, skillfully guides ready individuals from the conventional, fear-based morality of "ordinary right view" to the liberating, wisdom-based "noble right view."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to illustrate their points about teaching the Dhamma, right view, and the nature of suffering. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**
1.  **The Turd/Shit Metaphor:**
    *   **Used to describe dukkha (suffering) and unwholesome thoughts.** The wise person recognizes the "turd" (suffering/unwholesome thought) from a distance by its smell and avoids it. The unwise person sees it as dinner and consumes it, wanting more, not realizing it's the cause of their sickness. This illustrates the difference between recognizing dukkha immediately versus needing to immerse oneself in it ("spread it all over the walls") to understand it.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"The training is to be able to recognize Dukkha on the surface. That you don't have to cut the turd open to find it's full of shit. Yeah, you could see the turd at a distance and stay away from it."*

2.  **The Algebra Teacher Metaphor:**
    *   **Used to explain the importance of a teacher's passion and mastery.** A passionate algebra teacher who loves the subject will inspire students. A bad algebra teacher is the main reason people don't learn algebra well. This parallels Dhamma teaching: a teacher must be deeply eager and immersed in the Dhamma to teach it effectively.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"If you really, really, really, really, really cared about algebra... and they give you the teaching job of an algebra teacher... you like it, you show the students how much you like it, you love it, and they'll begin to love it too."*

3.  **The Notebook Metaphor:**
    *   **Used to counter the question "Who am I?"** The self is compared to a dynamic notebook where pages (thoughts, experiences) are constantly being written, replaced, and thrown out. Asking "Who am I?" is like asking what's definitively in a constantly changing notebook—it leads to clinging to temporary concepts.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"Asking, 'Who am I?' is asking, like, what's in a notebook that's dynamic. It doesn't have a particular answer."*

4.  **The Ladder Metaphor:**
    *   **Used to describe the attitude of an Arahant vs. a Bodhisattva.** An Arahant who doesn't teach is likened to someone who "pulled the ladder up after them" because they don't want others (who "stink" of suffering) climbing up. In contrast, a teacher motivated by compassion refuses to pull up the ladder.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"They've got their liberation, they have pulled the ladder up after them, because they don't want anybody climbing on that ladder."*

5.  **The Gold Vein Metaphor:**
    *   **Used by Speaker B to illustrate the choice after finding the Dhamma (striking gold).** You can either keep it to yourself or bring it back and tell everyone. This touches on the Buddha's initial hesitation to teach.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"If you find... a gold vein... you can either bring it back and tell everyone Or you can just not..."*

6.  **The Whiff/Smell Metaphor:**
    *   An extension of the turd metaphor, emphasizing that wisdom means recognizing dukkha from the slightest hint ("just a whiff") without needing deep immersion.

7.  **The Musical Score Metaphor:**
    *   **Used to explain that real learning is output, not just input.** You can read a music score (input), but you haven't truly learned it until you can play it or hum it (output). Similarly, Dhamma isn't learned until it can be "put back out" through practice, mulling over, and teaching.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"You don't learn something until you can put it out, you can reproduce it."*

### **Stories & Examples**
1.  **The Story of Upāli (likely referring to the Upāli Sutta):**
    *   **Used to show how the Buddha taught based on a student's readiness.** Upāli, a Jain, came to debate but was led by the Buddha to see that the mind (intention/thought) is the primary source of harm, not just action. Because Upāli was already well-established in morality (ordinary right view), he was ready to understand this and become a follower. The Buddha then taught him the deeper truths.

2.  **The Story of Aṅgulimāla:**
    *   **Used as a contrasting example of teaching someone deeply in "wrong view."** Aṅgulimāla was a murderer collecting fingers. The Buddha took a different, slower approach with him because his starting point was extreme wrong view ("I can get away with killing"). This story illustrates that a teacher must assess each student's starting point.

3.  **The Shoplifting Anecdote (Personal Story from Speaker B):**
    *   **A concrete example of "ordinary right view" and self-justification.** Speaker B confesses to shoplifting as a teen, rationalizing that stealing from big corporations was okay. This story is used to show how the mind creates excuses ("I can get away with it") and how noble right view sees the inherent fear and anger in the act itself as the punishment.

4.  **The Las Vegas/Casino Example:**
    *   **Used to illustrate how unwholesome thoughts have consequences.** People go to casinos with the thought "I can beat the system/get away with it." Even if they don't rob the casino, that thought leads them to lose money. The consequence (loss) is rooted in the initial thought.

5.  **The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Biblical reference):**
    *   **Used to explain the Dhamma teacher's motivation as "paying it forward."** A servant forgiven a huge debt by his king then refuses to forgive a small debt owed to him. The point is that gratitude for the gift of Dhamma should translate into generosity (teaching others), not a sense of ownership. One cannot pay back their teacher, only pay forward.
    *   **Key Quote:** *"The gratitude becomes generosity that we don't give back, we give it out to others, we pay it to other people."*

6.  **The "Dark Night of the Soul" Anecdote:**
    *   **A modern story (from the internet) used as a cautionary tale.** Someone was actively seeking a "dark night" experience, believing it was necessary for progress. The speakers use this to criticize the view that one must deeply immerse in suffering, contrasting it with the Buddha's teaching of a path "good in the beginning, middle, and end."

### **Overall Purpose:**
These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Dhamma concepts—like the primacy of the mind, the progression of views, the teacher's role, and the nature of dukkha—**relatable, memorable, and concrete**. They contrast "ordinary" and "noble" understanding, emphasize the importance of a teacher's insight and motivation, and illustrate the practical, non-magical reality of the Buddha's core teachings.
