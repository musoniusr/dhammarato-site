### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so you're talking about asking for forgiveness. So the question would be, why do you want to ask for forgiveness, or why do you want to apologize?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, no, so actually I want to apologize, but.

**Speaker A:** Um, is it because of your own feelings, or because you have a, let us say, a wise perception that someone is holding something against you, that you've actually crossed them in some way?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I definitely insulted someone, even though it was not my intention. But I think they probably know it. That was not my intention, but there's just like an unskillful—.

**Speaker A:** All right, what— how do you know what their reaction was in this particular instance? Let's get some— let's get it real. How do you know that they were offended?

**Speaker B:** Because of the reaction, like cold reaction. Yeah, the look on the face.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. Now that look on the face, do you— that you're talking about an event that happened what, yesterday or the day before?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I would say like a month ago.

**Speaker A:** A month ago. All right, so here's a really, really interesting question then. Do you think they still have that look on their face? Do you think that if they saw you again, they would have that look again? Are they carrying this around, or only you carrying it around, is the real question.

**Speaker B:** That's a good question. Yeah, it's because it's very personal. Like, some people hold things against you, like, really easily, and some people don't.

**Speaker A:** And, well, what is your guess? Do you think that they're still holding a grudge against you?

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, not really a grudge per se, but I would say it's not good for the relationship, for the friendship.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. So you think that the relationship has actually been damaged and you want to repair it? All right, yes. Okay, if you notice that I'm asking a lot of questions about this because we're trying to get right down to whether or not an apology is needed or not, and we've just discovered that yeah, probably is. As well as you will feel better if you give the apology. All right.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So we've already solved most of the issue.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right. So what do we come next with is, um, uh, to, to bring it up to them. Do you see them often, or would you have to make a special visit to go talk to them about this, or can you wait until you see them again, or what?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I'll just give him a call.

**Speaker A:** In person. I would recommend that you do this in person.

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, it would be like a video call, but yeah, the person is not in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's got to be done with a call. All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So did you offend them on a call? Because you said it was a look on their face.

**Speaker B:** No, in real life when I was back home.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it happened before you left to come to Thailand? Okay. And has it been bothering you all this time?

**Speaker B:** No, no, it has not been bothering me. Well, occasionally it pops up into my mind. I've been like pretty getting pretty good at letting go of this kind of stuff. But yeah, I value the friendship. So, and yeah, so I feel like it would be a good thing to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so here's the next question then. The next question would be, do you think it is as big a deal for them as it is for you? So that they're going to carry it into the future like you probably would unless you could get over it. In other words, can this— can this wait for 6 months until you see them again, or do you think they're going to continue to hold a grudge against you?

**Speaker B:** It's not really— yeah, I wouldn't call it like a grudge per se, but yeah, sometimes, for example, if it's like the opposite way around, if someone does something to me and I know like, oh, it's— they're just being like unskillful or unaware, then I will not hold it against them. But it's still like changes your perception of them. Yeah, in a, in a small way, but it's still like, it's like just the friendship.

**Speaker A:** Well, because you've mentioned it a couple of times, it appears that you feel like that you want to give them an apology, that you'll be— you'll feel better yourself whether they care or not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess, yeah, it feels like the right thing to do. And yeah, the way I think would be a good way to do it is—.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's not talk about a good way of doing it. You feel like that you need to get something off your chest or you need to apologize so that you'll feel better. Whether they care about it or not. And I do want to mention this, that I have actually been in that situation on many different occasions, and basically I have to remind them in detail what I'm talking about because they didn't care anymore. They had forgotten it, and I'm carrying it around and you're carrying it around, and you may have to dig it back up for them so that they'll even know what you're talking about. That's the question is, do you think that they really are carrying it around, or is this something you need to do for yourself? In other words, do they need an apology, or do you need to give one? Which is it? Is it both? That's possible.

**Speaker B:** I think both, but mostly it's something I carry around myself, I guess. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so there's little subtle differences because in fact, if they have forgotten about it, you'll have to remind them of it. So, or if it's right on the front of their mouth because they see you, they remember that as the thing that they remember you by.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's one of the things that you do need to figure out right away in your apology. And you can ask them directly, do you remember last month when I screwed up? And, and see what they say. And if they are in a happy state then you can take one avenue. And if they're not in a happy state, if they remember it, then you need to give a little, say, a more detailed, sincere, heartfelt apology rather than just reminding them and get it off your chest. Okay, okay. So it has to do with how they take it. So don't do too much planning in advance before you give the apology, because you, you, you might have to figure out what kind of apology you're going to give them when you get on the call with them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the wisdom, is that we have to plan on doing it right in the here now. Okay, so That's the first thing that we can go for, is what kind of apology that you're going to give them. The second thing that I would say is I would use the word apology. For instance, you can say, "I owe you an apology," as opposed to, "I would like to make an apology.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's— I like that. All right, why I like it, but it sounds better.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I would like to make an apology. I would like to get this off my chest is different than I owe you an apology and I want to fix things between us, because then it's.

**Speaker B:** All about yourself instead of like the other person.

**Speaker A:** Right. So bring both people into it rather than all you all the time. This is the whole point about the selfishness and the ego or the, uh, yourself. Take yourself out of it. Okay, so either I would like to make an apology to get it off my—.

**Speaker B:** Oh, sorry, I lost connection there for a moment. Can you still hear me?

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back. You broke away for a moment. All right, so, um, generally, uh, recommend that students do not use the word "I'm sorry," but you could go so far as to say that "I want to get this off my chest," which is doing the work of saying "I'm sorry," without actually— because the reality is that you are not in a state of sorrow, you are not in a state of grief. You are not in a state of guilt. So guilt and grief and sorrow are one side of it, and you're not in there. All right, but you do want to get it off your chest. There's a little bit, not a whole lot, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, uh, that's all right.

**Speaker A:** There's a different kind of an apology that you would, uh, give, uh, the victims of the family of the guy that you killed. Either accidentally or on purpose, right? Because that situation is that both people feel really, really bad about what happened.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you don't need to give that kind of an apology, and they probably wouldn't be expecting it for you. So the right way to do it is actually with a smile. To laugh on the phone. Hey dude, I owe you an apology. Or hey dude, I'd like to give you an apology to get this off my chest.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, that was what I was thinking, like keeping it light.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, keep it light in this case. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because that's what I was kind of afraid of, is that, um, well, I already thought I could handle it, but I don't want to make myself a victim in, oh, I'm such a bad person.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because you're not suffering, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. It's so easy. I've done that in a lot of situations where it's totally not necessary. It's just a small thing. And then you kind of talk yourself into feeling bad.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, don't talk yourself into feeling bad. That you, you've got your mind together enough that you can keep this light. And then the last thing that I would mention to you is, uh, in the patching up of it, as you end this part of the conversation, or maybe the whole conversation, the end of it is, I'd really like to see you again. I hope to see you again. That I hope that this does not harm our conversation or our relationship.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And that's the way to end it. I'll be really happy to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we've got a beginning of the conversation to find out how much they've got involved with this. The middle of it is giving the apology, and then we ended up with our cementing of the relationship.

**Speaker B:** That's good.

**Speaker A:** All right, you think that that answers your question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so Yeah, yeah, that's, uh, yeah, that'll do it. I got it.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much, Dhammarato. Okay, I appreciate that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, excellent. We'll see you later then.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a practical and wise exploration of **when and how to offer a meaningful apology** from a Buddhist mindfulness perspective.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Insight: Who is the Apology For?**
The central theme is investigating the motivation behind the apology. Dhammarato guides the student (Speaker B) to discern whether the need to apologize stems from:
1.  **A genuine desire to repair a damaged relationship** (the other person is clearly hurt and holding onto it).
2.  **A personal need to "get something off your chest"** (you are the one carrying the burden of the event).
The discussion reveals that in this case, it's primarily for the speaker's own peace of mind, though a desire to maintain the friendship is also present.

### **Key Practical Teachings:**

1.  **Investigate the Reality:** Don't assume the other person is still upset. Ask: "Are they carrying this, or only you?" The offense was a month ago; the other person may have moved on.

2.  **Tailor the Approach:** Don't over-plan. Gauge the other person's state during the conversation. Start by asking if they even remember the incident. Their response will dictate whether you need a light acknowledgment or a more heartfelt apology.

3.  **Use Skillful Language:**
    *   Prefer **"I owe you an apology"** or **"I'd like to make an apology"** over the more self-focused "I want to get this off my chest."
    *   **Avoid "I'm sorry"** if you aren't actually in a state of sorrow or guilt. The goal is clarity and repair, not unnecessary self-flagellation.
    *   **Keep it light** when appropriate. A smile and a "Hey, I owe you an apology for that remark last month" can be more effective than a heavy, guilt-ridden tone.

4.  **Structure the Conversation Wisely:**
    *   **Beginning:** Inquire about their memory and feelings regarding the event.
    *   **Middle:** Offer the apology clearly and succinctly.
    *   **End:** Cement the relationship. Express your hope to see them again and that this won't harm your friendship.

5.  **Avoid Ego Traps:** The talk warns against making yourself the victim ("I'm such a bad person") or creating suffering where there isn't any. The action was unskillful, but the apology should be a mindful, compassionate correction, not an act of self-punishment.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk reframes an apology from a social obligation or guilt-driven act into an exercise in **mindful communication and relationship repair**. The wisdom lies in first understanding your own mind and the likely state of the other person, then acting with clarity, kindness, and a focus on reconnection rather than on your own ego. The ultimate goal is to clear the air for both parties and preserve the harmony of the relationship.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speaker (A, likely Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors** and one implied **story** to illustrate the points about giving an apology.

### Metaphors:
1.  **"Carrying it around" / "Get it off your chest"**
    *   This is the central metaphor. It frames unresolved guilt or a perceived offense as a **physical burden** that a person lugs with them. The apology is then an act of putting down that weight to relieve oneself.
    *   **Example:** "Are they carrying this around, or only you carrying it around, is the real question." / "You need to get something off your chest."

2.  **"Patching up" / "Cementing of the relationship"**
    *   These are **repair/construction metaphors**. They depict the damaged relationship as something broken that needs mending ("patching up") or as a structure that needs its foundation strengthened ("cementing").
    *   **Example:** "In the patching up of it..." / "And then we ended up with our cementing of the relationship."

3.  **"Dig it back up"**
    *   This metaphor treats the past offense as something **buried**. Apologizing risks excavating an issue the other person may have forgotten, which reframes the risk of bringing it up.
    *   **Example:** "You may have to dig it back up for them so that they'll even know what you're talking about."

### Story / Hypothetical Scenario:
*   **The Extreme Contrast Story:** Speaker A creates a hypothetical story to define the boundaries of a necessary apology. He contrasts the listener's minor social offense with a **grave, tragic scenario**.
    *   **The Story:** He describes apologizing to "the victims of the family of the guy that you killed. Either accidentally or on purpose." This stark example illustrates a situation requiring profound sorrow, grief, and guilt.
    *   **Purpose:** This story is used to make a clear distinction. It shows the listener that their situation does **not** call for that level of emotional intensity ("you don't need to give that kind of apology") and helps justify the advice to "keep it light."

### Key Conceptual Framing (Not quite a metaphor, but a vivid analogy):
*   **The "Selfish" vs. "Relational" Apology:** Speaker A frames the approach to the apology by contrasting two mindsets:
    *   **Self-focused:** "I would like to make an apology to get this off my chest." (Focused on one's own relief).
    *   **Relationship-focused:** "I owe you an apology and I want to fix things between us." (Focused on the bond between both people).
    *   This is presented as a choice between centering **yourself** ("the ego") or centering the **relationship**.

**In summary,** the speaker uses metaphors of **burden, repair, and excavation** to make the emotional dynamics tangible, and employs a **hypothetical extreme story** to calibrate the appropriate tone for the apology. The advice moves from assessing whether the other person is "carrying" the burden, to how to avoid "digging it up" unnecessarily, to finally "patching up" and "cementing" the relationship.
