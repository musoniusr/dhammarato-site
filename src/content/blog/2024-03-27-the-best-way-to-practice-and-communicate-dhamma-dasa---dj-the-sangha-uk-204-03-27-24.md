### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, I think it's going. There we are. So, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, it's my second time that I join a call. Last time was, wait, are we on Wednesday? Yeah, so on Sunday, last Sunday.

**Speaker A:** Oh, nice, man. Did you have any, you or DJ, have anything you guys wanna say or talk about anything, or questions or anything?

**Speaker B:** Well, I was thinking that Dhammarato would be here, but I guess it's another type of Cole?

**Speaker A:** No, he's on, what day he's on set? Fridays. And is he also on another day for the UK?

**Speaker C:** Sundays.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** Friday and Sundays are the ones he makes it to, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now it's just us.

**Speaker B:** Because I saw a video about you guys.

**Speaker D:** Also.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was curious, like— Oh, nice. Are you the one hosting this call, or how does it work?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm hosting, but we're all just hanging out, talking, asking questions, having conversation about whatever, whatever comes to mind, whatever naturally arises.

**Speaker B:** All right. Where are you living?

**Speaker A:** I'm in Illinois.

**Speaker B:** Ah, and yet you're on the Sangha UK call.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, yeah, I think they just needed somebody to host it. Yeah. I don't think it matters where you're, exactly what location you're in, but.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** It's really about, yeah, the timing and the time zones, right? But if it works out for people who are in North America, you know, it works out.

**Speaker B:** So what time is it there?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'm in Canada. It's 1 there, yeah. It's 2 here, so.

**Speaker A:** I could put on an English accent if you like. Shall I talk like this?

**Speaker B:** Right, mate?

**Speaker D:** Good night, Mike.

**Speaker A:** Shrimp on the barbie. That's Australian. Now the UK people really aren't gonna show up. What's this bloody American talking like? He's an Aussie, right? But is there anything that you're curious about or interested in, or just, uh, anything that has come to your mind in the last week or so regarding the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Regarding the Dharma? Well, my current situation is that I've been traveling for like a lot of time now. So I've been practicing for a while, but I met Dhammarato, I guess, yeah, this month actually, like beginning of this month. So my practice of Anapanasati been like kind of changed because now I'm gladdening the mind instead of just observing and I guess letting go the things coming through me. So yeah, it has been like a big change and quite a good change, especially also because the way of how I was practicing was mostly— so instead of doing short sessions, of sitting. I would do like an hour, like twice a day, because I was in India a couple of days ago. I mean, actually yesterday. And, uh, cool. Yeah. And, uh, so I, I've done my first Vipassana courses, you know, the Goenka Vipassana style. So I, I learned a lot, but also found a lot of flaws. You know, in the frame, the way of teaching and practicing. So by meeting Dhammarato, a lot of things got clear, and that was really nice actually, because a lot of things got— I could clear out a lot of things, you know, like from my mind and the way of how I would see my practice and Dharma, you know, practicing the Dharma. And one thing that I've been realizing is because I've been on the move, you know, most of the time, and now I'm back in Turkey, Istanbul. So the—.

**Speaker A:** Sure get around, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the switch is really like really curious feeling, you know. And I realized that by practicing the Dharma, everywhere is the same. I mean, you know, like I can feel that I'm disturbed because, for instance, my body language is mostly Indian way, you know, and people here obviously they don't use their body language the same way. And at the same time, I realized that with my practice of Dharma, everything is still fine, but I can see my mind creating new thoughts, you know, new problems because of being in a new place. And I'm actually in an apartment with my own room, which I haven't had for like years now. I've been, you know, a nomad, let's say like this, for maybe 4 years. So, you know, having a new routine, just silly things, you know, like money, because in India it's so cheap. In Turkey it's a little bit more expensive. So you know how to deal with— so I can see my mind going through like a lot of process, but I'm still okay. You know, when I'm sitting, I'm like, oh, everything is fine, I'm good.

**Speaker A:** Very good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I don't know, I don't know if I really have a question. It's just I have observations that I've I'm going through, you know. And yeah, so, you know, sometimes I have some unwholesome thoughts like doubts, but it's not like doubt that makes me anxious. It's just doubts about this new situation. Like, then I just realize, I mean, it's fine. There's no need to be worried about these things. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Definitely. Yeah, there's no need to be worried. It can be difficult, especially when you're traveling a lot, but it could only be difficult insofar as we're allowing it to manifest in our mind that way. Just like you were saying, once you chill out and you realize, oh, it's not too bad, you know, everybody's got things going on. That seems to be a really good way to be, you know. And as far as body language goes, there's nothing wrong with body language, just like there's nothing wrong with speaking French as opposed to English. We're talking, in my opinion, just my opinion, but when we're talking about body language, we're talking about like agitation, we're talking about discontent. And it can come off in the way we move our body, twitching, itching, all these things. But if you are aware of what your hands are doing, if you're aware of your manner of speaking as you're doing it, if there's no dissatisfaction there, if there's a harmonious balance, a peace there, there's nothing wrong with body language. It could be quite helpful for learning, especially with ASL.

**Speaker B:** I don't think there's like body language is a problem, but it's just like in every cultures they use their body differently. And it's not about like, you know, agitation. For me it's more like, for instance, Indians, they would, you know, they would do this, you know, with their head to say yes, you know. And, uh, we join the hand to say thank you, you know, like it's kind of like shaking hands in the West, you know. So I, I have still these reflexes you know, of how interact with people. But here people, they are quite like steady, I guess. I mean, they don't really use much their body when they— I don't know. And even the faces, their expressions. Turkish are really nice people, and if you smile at them, they will smile. And but in India, people are really smiling, like it's amazing. You look at someone and Many times if you just stop in the first seconds, in the first moment, many people would be really like a face really like serious and closed, but at the moment you smile, the faces of most of the people in here just shine, and this is wonderful, you know. And that's why it's different here, especially because even if Istanbul, Turkey is Asian, most of it, most of the country. It's definitely a westernized country now, especially Istanbul. So yeah, it's just, it's just, you know, how things move and how I move in this, in this world actually, and how the Dharma is, is, uh, is with me all the time, and how, how I can see like also my, um, the experience that I have with a stranger You know, like, I don't know if it was the case before, but I realized that people tend to be more smiling when I'm interacting with them now. I mean, I kind of observed that, yeah, there's something more chill when I'm interacting with people since I've been practicing this new way of gladdening the mind and feeling really good. And especially because, so I arrived yesterday and I finally got my own space to practice, I mean to sit and to really reinforce my practice of Dharma, which I was missing this own space when I was in just a few days ago in Mumbai because I was in a hostel. But it doesn't matter where you are, you can still practice the Dharma. But I really realized that having your own space to sit, you know, secluded, really lifts you up, you know, during your day, especially to feel good. But here I don't feel right now gladdening much the mind, but just generating like an inner smile. You know, which would be inside, obviously, and then rise on my face. And since I've been practicing this, when I'm interacting with someone, I have like this, uh, yeah, this thing with people, like I just want to smile at them, you know, like, and people would really smile. Like, I'm like, oh wow, they're smiling.

**Speaker A:** That's good, man. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, smiling is wonderful, you know. Sometimes I find for like Caucasian people, they sometimes it can be, or white people, whatever you want, would like to call it, Europeans. They, for indigenous people, for what some people call like Hispanic people, they're very like, my face is like, I'm very, I look angry a lot. My wife says I have like a resting bee face. I'm really, most of the time, quite jolly and happy on the inside. But for people who don't really know me, it can be like, man, he's serious, and I couldn't be less serious or, you know, it doesn't often depict what I'm actually feeling on the inside. But yeah, it can be helpful when people just express their emotions on their face. It's wonderful. And whether they do or don't isn't really a problem because then we're just projecting our own expectations onto others. But there is a lightness that comes when we're practicing here and now of being satisfied here and now. There's a lightness and ease, a peace that comes with it. And smiles, yeah, they come and go and they naturally arise. And yeah, if you can help spread that energy with a smile, that's a wonderful thing, especially if it comes more easily for you. It's a much welcome sight, that's for sure, because we're so used to the fake smiles in modern society of people trying to sell us something. In society, they're always— I find with business a lot, or anything in Western culture, well, at least in America, there's a lot of psychological coaching, there's a lot of business training people how to be good at their careers, how to further themselves in their careers, and a lot of it is like feigning empathy. They're like, hey, if you want to seal that deal, get to know the person, get to know their family, ask questions about them, remember their names. And it's like, but you should do that because it's coming naturally, not because you're wanting to get something selfish out of it. So it's a lot like kind of like a psychopathic kind of way of teaching people something in the West is if you want to get close to people, if you want a connection, and in most cases they're doing so with some outcome of buying something or having them buy something from me. It's like in America we've become really good at the fake smile of trying to put something on. Every interaction is a barter, is a sale, is something that I want from you or you want from me. So when people see a natural smile, when they meet a person who naturally feels satisfied, I feel like the energy is much different. It's much more real, you know. It's not forced in the negative sense of the word, you know. So, so yeah, smiling is wonderful, and authenticity is even more wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's one of the things that we talked, uh, on Sunday with Dhammarato, you know. He He talked about the Bodhisattva principle, which is something that I've been really interested in, you know, like I feel it's a beautiful thing. I mean, the way of how you can enhance your mind, you know, in this way of, in the way of the Bodhisattva. And then I really liked it because he kind of crushed the concept of Bodhisattva, which was kind of, I might not say it the right way, but like it's like kind of the loser way, you know, saying like, may all living beings be happy, and I should be the last one enlightened, and I wish that all people, I mean all beings, would be enlightened before me. So yeah, it's kind of how he just crushed this idea. And then he just talked about the fact that, yeah, the people that we should actually wish, you know, enlightenment, happiness, whatever, should be around us, you know. And one of the tools would be, yeah, smiling, smiling at people, simply as that. And yeah, I really realized that it's really powerful, especially like, you know, like I've always been really.

**Speaker C:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** If it's concern the proper word, but every time that I would see someone begging, you know, in the street, I mean, obviously I cannot give all the time money, but considering the person and smiling at it, I always been something that I would try to do.

**Speaker A:** And that's very good. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I think that, yes, smiling is so powerful, you know, as a Dhamma practice. You don't need much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's almost like Zen, like it's the simplest form of communicating the Dharma, you know. It's like almost a form of silence, a form of just smiling, radiating content, being content. What more could you ask for, you know? If you're satisfied and you're letting everybody see it, you know, that's one of the best ways. Like Dhammarato says, to help spread the Dharma and not doing it in a forceful kind of knocking on your door, trying to sell you some new religion type of thing. You know, it's like, it's just something that comes, that is born out of being satisfied. Just like you were talking about compassion. Compassion naturally arises when we're satisfied, you know, because a person who's content doesn't really need to steal anything. A person who's satisfied is naturally joyful and doesn't need to put other people down or to be jealous or anything like that. So it's, yeah, that's wonderful, man.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, talking about smiling too, another aspect with that is, you know, it has an element of being mindful or remember the body, right? So we can actually become aware of what's going on with the body, and by extension, what is happening now. So that's another aspect to it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely. Yeah, how you were talking about that Metta, and how I think a lot of— I guess it's kind of like a mundane view, a lot of people say those things, you know, may all beings, be this and be that. And it's like I was telling somebody the other day, I don't know if it was on a call or not, but it's like if you see a hungry dog on the street and you're praying, may this dog have food, may this dog find food, it's like, if you have food, if you could have a means to get food, give it to the dog. That's a better prayer. Reminds me of what Frederick Douglass said in his autobiography, he's like, you know, I prayed all the time, and then I only started to become free when I started praying with my legs. Meaning he started to run away from his captors, and then the prayers really worked when he prayed with his legs. So, but you know, and at the other token too, a lot of Tibetan Buddhists, a lot of different sects will say those nice things. And this, you know, there's nothing to— yeah, that may not be the correct way, you know, but who really cares, you know, if the person's saying the prayer even, or if the person's not aware of the word Dharma, if they're not aware of these— if they're satisfied in the moment and they're giving off an energy of wishing, hoping that other people are content, I don't see too much damage in that, you know. It can't do too much, but it's important to keep the Buddhist teaching in mind of what he actually was trying to get across, which Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, satisfaction here and now.

**Speaker B:** Well, the thing with all this practice, especially like Tibetan Buddhism, you know, which many come from bone religion, there might be like a, like.

**Speaker D:** A, how do.

**Speaker B:** You say this, like not from directly the Buddha, I guess, but I realized that when I would, you know, like be close to Tibetan monks, nuns, whatever, you know, it's more about— it's the same thing that gladdening the mind, actually, all these practices. Because, you know, when you wish all the time that all living beings may, you know, be happy It's not just about, I believe, saying the thing. It's really enhancing something in you. And it's not just the practice. Obviously, they have like so many practices. Like, for instance, when I was in the state of Karnataka in India, there are like different Tibetan settlements, like refugees camp, and you have one of the biggest monastery of of Tibetan Buddhism. And so I went there a weekend to meet a friend who is a Geshe, so it's like a high rank, like a really important teacher. And he just, you know, like showed me around and asked some questions about how monks and nuns spend their time. And they spend like all the time reading, you know, like reading Dharma teaching, you know, and from 6 to even midnight they just are in the Dharma, you know, like praying, doing Puja, and chanting all the sutras that they have in Sanskrit. And they finish their day by debating. So I don't know if you know how it looks like, but it's really intense, you know. And so you have all these practices that actually just, you know, your mind is just like crushed and reborn at the same time. So for me, practices are quite healthy, I think, even if Dhammarato says it's like, you know, not the right way. But I believe of gladdening the mind, you know, like using your mind and sculpting a new shape, you know, of how to practice and how to become wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like football, you know, soccer. It's like you can visualize yourself Scoring the goal, getting the ball into the net, past the goalkeeper. And it's not that visualizing it is wrong, right? A lot of athletes use visualization. It's for— but if you're visualizing getting the ball into the goal all the time, if you're studying books on how to get the ball into the goal all the time, that can be really helpful. But if that's all you're doing and that ball keeps getting blocked by the goalkeeper, it's not really helpful. It might even come to a point where it may even hurt you. So, the key would be the middle way, would be a balance. Like, sure, there's nothing wrong with visualization. There's nothing wrong with chanting. There's nothing wrong with producing these types of energies within ourselves. But at the end of the day, if it's not bringing us satisfaction right where we are, right where we sit, what use is it? I think, but if we're using it, if he's looking at the goal and he's saying, okay, I will get this ball in, I'm visualizing in my mind, and he's done the physical practice enough, and on top of everything, he starts scoring goals, it doesn't really matter in a way whether you're dancing or reciting rap music, as long as what you're doing is getting that ball into the net. So if you find yourself saying, satisfied, if you find yourself gladdening the mind, rinsing and repeating, remembering to look and change and congratulating yourself. If you're satisfied, you're satisfied, you know, and then rinsing and repeating. It's not difficult, just like it's not difficult to get the ball into the net. But oftentimes we could get in our own way. And I think that's what a lot of the critique is with not enough emphasis on gladdening the mind here and now, but rather like doing it in some future way. You know, like, may all beings be peaceful in the future. It's like things aren't necessarily that way, but we're wanting it to be that way. We're praying, we're hoping. It's like, well, I don't know what things will be like in the future, but I know how they're like now. And like everything in life, it's not doing what we want. And I could be okay with that. And in that way, it's perfect. And sure, if I could do something to help out the world in some way, shape, or form, or being, definitely I would do it. But the best thing we can do is if we're satisfied ourselves, then those things, that compassion, that helping others, it comes naturally, like arising from a fountain, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, it's interesting with like the phrase, you know, may all beings be happy, because I think Dhammarato really does point out like where one might get into Dukkha with that, where they're like, yeah, I want all these beings out there to be happy, and this really conceptualized way, and furthermore, I'm one of those beings and I'm not happy. I like his spin on it when he brings up, you know, may all beings be as happy as I am right now, you know, coming back to that attitude of a winner. But, you know, thinking about that phrase and having those kinds of thoughts, right, really, I suppose, at least with my understanding, is if one is practicing that, you know, in a way that's going to lead to the end of Dukkha, it's really just pointing towards harmlessness or non- cruelty, right? Like rather than wishing ill will upon whoever, right?

**Speaker A:** It's just— yeah, yeah, there's no ill intention even. Yeah, I mean, well, even in the mundane teachings, there's no ill intention by either the teachers or the monks or the students or the lay people themselves. There's no— it's just in a way, in a way, the mundane teaching is just to kind of give people something that don't that aren't able to grasp the supermundane, I've always thought. And some people are willing to, some people can. And like Dhammarato said, when his teacher was like, "Hey man, now's the time to start doing it because it's kind of necessary," and all these things, and he's just like, "Okay, no problem." You know, it's like either way, at the end of the day, it's like You know, we're not going to be— we don't have to play the game. I'm going to be the best Buddhist, I'm going to be the best this, I'm going to be the best this, you know, I'm going to teach the Dhamma the best of it this way, I'm going to hold on to these concepts that I think the Buddha really taught the most. If I'm satisfied, all these things of Tibetan Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Theravada, who's right, who's wrong, black and white, all that stuff disappears. The self, not-self, impermanent self, all these things disappear. It's only when I start attaching to these concepts, when I'm not remembering to look and change, and I take these things in the mind seriously and don't see them for what they are, which is Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, impermanence, dissatisfactory, and not fixed. It's not a fixed self. It's constantly changing. It's not going to last forever. So why hold on to all these things? You don't need to be master enlightened. You don't need to be the best, smartest, and brightest. You don't need to have all the correct answers all the time. That's not what I am. If I'm a human, I'm partly a human, just as the bird flies. I'm just going to be a human, you know, and that's good enough for me. Right now is good enough. And if we can learn to accept things as they are, good enough. And yeah, what more do we need to do, you know? Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I like that you brought up too, like, the, you know, don't need this, don't need that, in terms of, you know, we have all these ideas of being a perfect whatever, right? And really, they're concepts. And so coming back to, like, whatever it is, an immediate renunciation, right? That's going towards the wholesome, where it's being like, yeah, I don't need that. I've been actually, you know, when I'm practicing throughout the day, but also when I get into seclusion, just coming back to nothing to get, you know, whatever that thing is. And then just breathing, you know, coming back to relaxing breaths. And that's enough. Like, just experience reality as it is. And there's nothing to get, you know, rid of either. Like, so, you know, it's interesting because I'll kind of play around with these wholesome thoughts and come back to them. And then even if the thought comes up, well, there's, you know, there's hindrances to get rid of. And it's like, yeah, when hindrances arise, But if we have the thought, there's nothing to get rid of, right? We're kind of taking that winner's attitude where it's like, yeah, no, because if we're like, now I'm fabricating a whole bunch of hindrances right now to get rid of, right? So it's about breaking the cycle. There's nothing to get rid of right now when we recognize it fully. There's nothing to get, there's nothing to keep. So that's another thing too that's been kind of nice is just coming back because You know, an experience will arise or what have you, and then there'll be like sort of like a wanting that, you know, to continue, or some kind of, you know, you could say insight or what have you, whatever it is, right? That need to hold on, that need to keep something, and just being like, no, there's nothing to keep. And so it's really easy, yeah, easy to come back to satisfaction when that's the case. And that's what this is about.

**Speaker A:** It really is super easy to come back to satisfaction because no matter what happens, it's remembering to look and change. And then, as what I like to say, as these baby dukkhas arise, these baby dissatisfactions, those are okay too because it's just more nutrients for the Dhamma, for the for the soil of our mind, you know. And if we look at suffering as something that's beneficial to helping our Dharma practice, does it then still stay suffering or dissatisfaction? No, we transform it. We transform it into satisfaction by looking at it differently, by changing our way we're thinking about it, feeling about it. Emoting about it, with wholesome actions and nurturing actions and speech. It's quite simple. It's remarkably simple. I used to play a game with myself where, "Oh, I have to be the best Buddhist. I have to know the most, be the most, see the most, do the most." And then one day I woke up from hearing Dhammarato talk for I'm always listening to him talk and things start to click like, "Oh, you know, maybe I'm not the best Dharma host. Maybe I'm not the best Pali Canon, you know, know everything that's in there, know all the words scholar, you know, but that's okay." And me being okay with not being the best, me being okay with things as they are right here, right now, just me alone with my breath is enough. It doesn't matter what the Buddha said in the Pali Canon. I have Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, who I know is a— we can all speculate all day long. Well, the Buddha said this, and Ananda wrote this down, and these things in the Pali Canon. Okay, that's great. That's wonderful. And if it helps, it's wonderful. But at the end of the day, I like the Dharma because when you meet or when you read about people like Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, when you meet people like Dhammarato, you don't need to really even know anything about the Buddha or the Pali Canon because these people are telling you something that if you practice will work. So they are the Buddha, you know, and when you're satisfied, you thereby then become the Buddha as well. That's always kind of been there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it makes me think about— because personally I really like to read, so I've been reading a lot. I like to read different type of books, especially Dharma teaching, like from Mahayana, Theravada. And some are quite, you know, like last time— not last time, like one of the last book that I tried to read from Mahayana teaching was the Madhyamaka from Nagarjuna, so about emptiness, you know. And so I couldn't really like read the book as, yeah, as I usually would do, so I kind of stopped it and I also realized that all the books that I read, which have taught me things, but most of them I don't really remember at the end. And the thing is, the one thing that I remember is to, you know, to practice Anapanasati and to, you know, to the simple things, you know. It's not from the heavy deep teaching from books that I, that I read, that I'm actually practicing. I'm practicing the most simple thing that might lead to this really complex, uh, concepts that you find in Buddhism. And, uh, yeah, that's the power I, I feel is like, because once when I'm reading those really tricky Buddhist teaching, that I close the book and I just go on in my daily life. The book doesn't exist anymore. It's just the simplicity of practicing Anapanasati, you know. And that's why for me it's so powerful.

**Speaker A:** This Dharma. Sorry, if what Dhammarato— you were asking where Dhammarato was earlier. If he were here, I can't be positive, but I'm sure he would tell you along those lines. The best book we can read is between our own ears. It's in our heart. And it's existing because only you can really know if you're satisfied. Only you can change your unwholesome thoughts, feelings, and emotions into something wholesome with nurturing speech, nurturing actions, wholesome speech, wholesome actions. So That's what I was telling my friends the other day. I'm like, who cares if you're the King of France? Who cares if you're the King of the world? If you're not satisfied, what good does that do? You could recite the whole Pali Canon up and down. What good does it do if you're not satisfied? That's why it doesn't have to be Dhammarato or Buddha Dasubhikkhu or the Buddha himself. If you meet a mechanic who's working on a car and he gives you a practice where where you can do for yourself and you can see that, wow, this is working. This guy's making me, turning the Dukkha into Sukkha. Yeah, it's probably good advice to take from that person. You know, it doesn't matter as long as it's getting, we're looking at the results and the results are, can we be satisfied here and now without needing anything outside of what's within us? 'Can we be satisfied?' And if the answer is no, then change it to, 'Yes, we can be satisfied, it's easy.'.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, earlier today I went to get some groceries, and once I was in front of the guy to pay. Well, my, I don't really speak Turkish, I just know few words, you know, few numbers. But it's kind of, you know, I'm kind of rusty, you know, like my brain is still in India for some, you know, for some stuff. And so the guy was, you know, talking, I mean, to me about things and I couldn't really understand. And I realized that he wasn't really happy about something, I don't know. And I felt some discomfort rising in me, you know, like because of being in this awkward situation, not understanding the guy. And suddenly I just felt happy not to be able to understand, and I just be like, whatever, and just, I just smiled because the situation, I was like, why should I worry about what this guy is, you know, disturbed with? Are not happy with. And yeah, it's for some stuff I think it's good to be ignorant sometimes, you know, like, well, whatever, I don't know this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's good to be ignorant of other people's ignorance, you know. It's like you can't change the weather, you can't change other people's attitudes, so why would we let it affect us, you know, why would we let it rain on our parade, you know. It's like, uh, they can feel however they wish. And like Buddhadasa Bhikkhu said when they was asked about like people who were saying bad things about him behind his back, he said, oh, I love when people talk bad about me. It's great, it's wonderful, because that's the Eightfold Path, the Noble Path. It's like, oh, there's something happening that should cause discontent? No, it shouldn't. I'm going to be satisfied. I'm going to use it as fuel to be satisfied here and now. So that's exactly what you did. And it's nice to congratulate ourselves when we catch those moments, you know, when we start developing this kind of momentum, these kind of good habits. That's great.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, no, that's good noticing, like when we become aware of that. Yeah, yeah, Alex, like seeing the kind of even subtle, you know, thing, forms of dissatisfaction that come up. I mean, that's why that translation of Dukkha as dissatisfaction can be a helpful pointer, because it's like, no, this is very thorough. Like having a kind of unpleasant, or what would be perceived as an unpleasant, you know, experience at the supermarket can get turned around so quickly to where we we can be satisfied again, you know. But who knows, those little things, you know, if we aren't watching, you know, might wind up building up into a big thing, right? But we notice those and we change them around, and it's just us. It's wonderful. Yeah. Well, I felt like touching on— we were talking a bit about, you know, really it's about directly knowing this, right? At the end of the day, it's about directly understanding you know, this is, you know, the end of dissatisfaction right here, right now. You know, it's not something about, you know, really having a hardcore, like, oh, once we have the conceptual idea of it, then it's, then it's it, right? Or we have to go and prove a bunch of stuff to a bunch of people, and then that's it. It's like, no, directly understanding this. And funny enough, I'm going to go to a text or a sutta, and it's quite a popular one to bring up, but the Kalama Sutta, right, where the Kamas, you know, ask the Buddha, like, he comes into a village and they're like, oh, there's all these Brahmins and there's all these different teachers, who do we follow? You know, and the Buddha kind of says, you know, don't go by that what this person says, don't go by this thing, don't go by something just because it's in the text, only one you directly know, that is what to follow. And then he does lead into, you know, is delusion is ignorance in the sense of ignorance, you know, that actually leads to one's harm, you know, lead to my welfare or, you know, not welfare, right? Or to the welfare of myself or others, right? So it's like looking into that and being like, oh, of course, of course that leads not to my welfare or with greed or ill will, right? So it's like directly when we understand these things, you know, obstruct, you know, being satisfied right here, right now. That's it. We directly understand that. It's interesting talking though about ignorance and that kind of in some cases, you know, in one context actually being good, a particular kind of ignorance. And really this is about like how we direct the mind, right? So it's like, yeah, no, if we're directing the mind to where we're worrying about like everything that people are saying about us, it's like, no, that's going to be satisfy. There's no way we can— there's only so much you can do about that, and all the people-pleasing and all that, that's not going to wind up being satisfied, or you're not going to wind up being satisfied that way. We're not going to, you know. So when one recognizes, hey, we can drop all that, that's fine, that's cool. But again, it's not like one needs to worry about harming other people, because when we're content and satisfied, we're not going to be a jerk. We're not going to harm other people. We don't want anything enough to the point where we're going to do that. And that's the point.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's why society tries to make you feel miserable so you buy lots of things, because miserable people buy lots of makeup, buy lots of gym memberships, buy lots of this, buy lots of retreats, buy lots of that. Miserable people are always looking for a way out of misery, and they'll spend and lots of money to find a way out of it. But when you're satisfied, how could you ever charge for helping somebody who's dissatisfied, helping them see the light and get satisfied if they want it? You know, it's like, how can you charge money for that? These things naturally you want to give it away to somebody who's asking you about it or curious about it. You almost can't help but talk about it because it's awesome. Yeah, it's the golden— it's the golden carrot that's here and now and always has been here. We just had to brush the dirt off a little bit and be like, oh yeah, this thing's here, this wonderful thing that's available to me. The doorway of the breath that shows me that these conceptual notions, they're just that, you know, they're just concepts. Just like the bird flies, the human has very sensitive things that cause them all different types of thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and it's okay. And the nurturing speech of let's come back to the breath. Those things aren't really real even. We see you, Mara. We know what you are. You can't fool us into thinking you're real, real important anyway. So, you know, if you're satisfied, you're satisfied. And that's the cool thing about this practice is it's kind of like.

**Speaker C:** It's.

**Speaker A:** So user-friendly in that way. You know that you're on the right path when you start becoming more satisfied. If you find, if you wake up one day and you find, man, I've been practicing this Noble Eightfold Path and I've been satisfied a lot lately. And even when I'm not satisfied, I'm not even really unsatisfied because I quickly remember to look and change it into satisfaction. And then we just rinse and repeat. And come back to this beautiful breath of the moment where everything's fine here, nothing's happening, nobody's out to get me, I'm just chilling, you know, not causing any harm, not doing anything, just talking the Dharma. I mean, this is heaven on earth right here. This is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's one thing that I realized through one Mantra which is one of the most famous ones I guess, like Om Mani Padme Hum. Which means, yeah, precious lotus, precious jewel, jewel in the lotus. And yeah, I like to chant this. Like, me too. When I do the first session in the morning and the last one in the night, I really like this practice, you know, like, to the first thing that I would say and the last thing that I would say would be this wholesome Mantra, reflecting on the meaning and on the Paramitas. And I actually really realized the meaning of having this precious jewel with you, in you, you know, which took me some time, I guess. But now I realize that it's like, you know, you're wearing a backpack all the time on you. And it's kind of becoming a blanket, a warm blanket around you. Sometimes you can, you know, forget about it, and suddenly it's just back on you, around you, in you, you know. And that's the jewel, you know. That's the— yeah, this is crazy. It's so— it's a precious thing. It's amazing, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's available here and now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's the only thing that is worthy of any real pursuit, you know. And that's what everybody's looking for really, is satisfaction. That's what all the actors— I always think it's so funny, I see the most beautiful women on Instagram, and I'm talking like Selma Hayek, like these beautiful models and actresses. And I can't help but notice they're still always posting, always posting selfies. But there's nothing wrong. I'm not judging them or anything. But it does show me that they're searching for something. They want something. And I know that they want satisfaction. And in a lot of ways, people try to get it by getting attention from others, you know? And it's like You don't need anything outside of yourself. It's all right here, right now. So you don't have to chase the like buttons. You don't have to chase the subscribes. And that's what a lot of younger people are starting to develop, these bad habits of, oh, people must like what I say. People must subscribe to my beliefs. People must give me attention that I seek. And nothing could be further from the truth, you know. You didn't need any of them. Yeah, just need your breath. And you don't even need that, because if you're dead, like Dhammarato says, all your problems are over anyway. So you're good to go.

**Speaker D:** Yep, everything dies, but let's chill.

**Speaker A:** Yep, everything changes.

**Speaker B:** What's that coffee that you're drinking?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, coffee. Dunkin' Donuts coffee.

**Speaker B:** A favorite?

**Speaker A:** My favorite? Yeah, um, my favorite would probably be an, uh, some coffee I make myself at home. Because I put a little cocoa powder.

**Speaker D:** And a little.

**Speaker A:** Coconut oil in it.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just black bold coffee. That's my favorite. But I do love Dunkin' Donuts. It's wonderful. But I know good coffee. I know like there's like the— I go to some coffee shops, I'll get some like really nice espressos and stuff. So I like the quality stuff too, but 'But this is good enough.' Yeah, good enough is perfect.

**Speaker D:** That's kind of like an interesting aspect when thinking about it, you know, when we're kind of ordinarily going on about like, 'Okay, I kind of prefer this coffee,' but really, like, when we understand, it's like, yeah, the answer is like whatever coffee we're currently drinking, you know. If we're like— I think this is kind of Anagami, we can talk about it sometimes or what have you, but yeah, recognizing like, yeah, it's whatever coffee we're currently drinking, this is enough, you know. And because ultimately, as we were talking.

**Speaker A:** About, right, it's like— The monks aren't gonna like that one. What? Oh, hi everybody.

**Speaker D:** Hello.

**Speaker C:** This is my first time here.

**Speaker A:** Oh, welcome, dude.

**Speaker C:** Thank you. I'm still kind of figuring out Skype, this looks very weird. These are kind of very weird proportions.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a— you'll get used to it, it's not too difficult of a platform really. Your camera looks good.

**Speaker C:** Is my picture like okay, or do I like seem weirdly out of— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** They'Re always changing and flip-flopping the sizes and stuff on Skype, depending on how many people and how you're holding your phone if you're on a phone. So don't worry about that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right, but great to be here. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, great to have you, man. We were just talking about, uh, coffee, and, and he was saying you like Dunkin' Donuts, and I was like, well, I do know there's quality stuff that I like, but Dunkin' Donuts is good enough. And then DJ was saying how that's like, yeah, that's kind of like a good little Dharma lesson. And then I was saying like, but I know, I know some people are like, well, water should be good enough. But that's another Dhamma lesson because it's like, yeah, I'm not the most perfect Dharma practitioner and I'm okay with that. I drink coffee. Yes.

**Speaker D:** As do I, as do I. But yeah, no, that's sort of the thing though, is because then we can be like, oh, I have to get everything in order, and only then, once I become the perfect practitioner, then I can finally be satisfied.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, I'm sure there's people out there who practice the Dhamma, and they're like, they try to be like that crazy wisdom. Oh, I should be allowed to do whatever I wish because it's like I don't go that extreme, but I do have coffee and some other little pleasures here and there that probably wouldn't fit in a wat somewhere or something. But that's okay. That's okay with me. I don't have to be the best.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we can have pleasures, but we don't have to cling to those pleasures when they end.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, as long as there's no dissatisfaction, as long as you're not hurting yourself or others. More power to you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, precisely. No, that's just it. It's a really like helpful reflection I find. Yeah, whenever, you know, I remember and I'm consuming whatever food or beverage, right, is to just be like, oh yeah, but really at the end of the day, whatever pleasure comes from this is temporary. And I can have, or I can recognize a pleasure that is not relying on these things, right? It's not relying on the coffee. It's not relying on whatever this thing is. Just by coming back to the breath, just by abandoning the need for anything, right? Just by being like, okay, well, there's nothing to get, you know, there's nothing to get rid of. There's nothing, you know, to keep or hold on to. Again, that's just what I've been coming back to. And to come back to just, yeah, no, just then satisfaction just comes up. It's cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's why a lot of the Pali canon is so specific and so, especially not even mentioning getting into the rules for the monastics and stuff like that, but it's like telling somebody, you know, just like chill out and be a good person isn't good enough. Don't worry, be happy. It's not good enough for some people. So then you got to get— well, it's like, what's a good person? It's like, do I have to tell you what a good person is? Yeah, but everybody has these ideas of what a good person is and what they should be and shouldn't be. But the wise person, to them, it just kind of like comes naturally. Like, you don't hurt yourself, you don't hurt others, you don't unintentionally try to cause Dukkha for yourself or others. And it's like, but okay, the student asks the questions, the student gets thousands of different specific answers, you know? And it's like, well, let's start with giving up drugs, let's give up alcohol, let's give up dancing, let's give up music, and learn to be okay without needing anything on the outside. So it's teaching people who in a lot of ways just never learned to just be like, don't worry, be happy, you know? It's showing them how to don't worry, be happy. It's guiding them along, which is wonderful. For the rest of us, we get to drink coffee. I'm just joking.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But do you go there for the donuts or the coffee?

**Speaker A:** Well, you know, I'm not really a sweet person, but I have had my fair share of donuts in my life. But mostly I'm a coffee drinker. Yeah, just when I go there, I get a coffee and I'm satisfied with that. I'm like a meat and potatoes type of guy, not so much of a sweets. I do like dark chocolate, it's pretty good. What? I like dark chocolate, it's not too bad. Yeah, a little bit here and there, nothing crazy.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, I forgot to mention my name, well I just like burst into this Sangha. So yeah, I'm Tuomas and I'm from Finland.

**Speaker A:** Oh, how is it? How do you say it? Thomas?

**Speaker C:** You can say Thomas if it's okay, but it's in Finnish, it is pronounced.

**Speaker A:** Tuomas. Tuomas.

**Speaker D:** Tuomas.

**Speaker A:** Tuomas, okay, cool. Yeah, that's awesome, man. It's a good name. That's a good darn name. Yeah. Is there many, is there many Dharma practitioners where you're from?

**Speaker C:** I just got, like last week, I got into this local group, or we kind of formed it. There was this one Theravada Mahayana teacher who I contacted, and we formed a small group of like 3 people who practice, and he will teach them every other week. So yeah, not that much. And I think there's only one like proper Buddhist, like registered Buddhist group in Finland, I think.

**Speaker B:** When you say group.

**Speaker A:** Temple?

**Speaker C:** Not a small group, but yeah, this big.

**Speaker B:** Do you mean like you have like, is it a center, like a Buddhist center or temple?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it has like a, it's not a temple. It has a kind of, or I don't know, I've never been there, but it is basically registered like in the, like, law stuff. I don't know how it works, but it's registered there. And it is basically, I think it's Korean Zen lineage they have there. Yeah, I've never been to that place, so I don't know the specifics of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Nice. Yeah, Zen is wonderful. I've never heard of, uh, I've never met any Korean Zen practitioners though, but that's pretty cool. I'd be interested to, uh, talk to some of them. They make great movies as Koreans. Yeah, great directors.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Korean movies. And also the humor, really funny way of making comedy. Even when it's not like a comedy movie, they just have this way of making it funny in some ways.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a Korean movie called Poetry, and I forget the director's name, but he also directed a movie called Burning. That's his most popular movie. And it has the guy from The Walking Dead in it, the Asian guy from The Walking Dead. But anyways, his movies are great because I get kind of— when I'm watching his films, I get kind of an ASMR, kind of like I get kind of in a Zen mode when I'm watching his movies because there's not much dialogue, and it's really amazing how he can draw you in with very little. And it's very Zen-like to me. Um, so if you ever get a chance, yeah, there's a movie called Burning and Poetry, and they're, they're wonderful. I wish I could remember the, uh, Korean director's name, but it's good stuff.

**Speaker B:** Watch one, it's called, uh, from also a Korean director, uh, so it's Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, I think.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I saw that one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That's really cool, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. But I don't know— It's about the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know if you looked on the internet to know where was this temple, but this temple doesn't exist. I was disappointed. I thought it was a place real, but they actually build The temple.

**Speaker A:** Floating, the floating Zendo or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. On the water?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they built it.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. That was a great movie.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well guys, that's probably it for me. Unless anybody else has any questions or anything?

**Speaker C:** Wait, so is it like ending now?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, well, yeah, I mean, we could stick around a little bit more if you had any questions, but— Oh, okay, I got the time wrong.

**Speaker C:** I thought it was starting now.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, it's been kind of confusing because in America, one, I'm an American host on a UK thing, and two, our times change and probably the UK maybe has stayed the same, so that's also confusing. Using. But it's 1 PM Central Standard Time on Wednesdays. I probably should change it to 2 to make it more convenient for UK people. But yeah, I don't know, we'll see what happens. But yeah, but next time if you join us at 1, we'll be on a lot longer. But if you have any other questions, we can all jump in and help you out if you had anything before we leave.

**Speaker C:** I think nothing specific comes to mind. I'm really looking forward to see if I can join the other Sangha meetings.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I hope you do. Yeah, they're on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and DJ, yeah, DJ does one, uh, Dhammarato obviously, and then this Wednesday one.

**Speaker D:** And yeah, yeah, Dhammarato does the, uh, Fridays and Sundays, and then I help post the, uh, Saturday ones on Discord.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, are you part of the website, the Open Sangha Foundation?

**Speaker C:** Not yet. Yeah, not yet.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, if you want you could become a member there. It's just, you just put in some like little information like email and stuff, and then, uh, I like to write posts and stuff, and, uh, people, you can talk to people on there and see information about different like temples and stuff. It's pretty cool.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I'll definitely check it out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Are you on our Skype groups and stuff?

**Speaker C:** No, no, nothing at all. Yeah. Nothing.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, join our Skypes, bro. Yeah, well, I mean, we're on Skype now, but join the US one too, and, uh, and the Discords and stuff if you're not already on them.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so, um, the joining the Skype groups, is there like some specific I need to join, or just like click the links on the Dhammarato videos, or.

**Speaker A:** What say you, DJ?

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, so for the Skype ones, it's just— I mean, you're already in this one, so it would just be joining the US one, click the link. But on the Discord, it's pretty much the same thing. On the videos, they have the links to the Discord, and then you can just join in, and there's a bunch of different chats. You can go— I don't know if you have Discord, but there is a browser version, and then you can also download an app for Discord as well.

**Speaker C:** Okay, thank you. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, looking forward to seeing you at more of these little get-togethers.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, great, I'm looking forward to it as well. It was really nice meeting you all.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You're awesome, thank you everybody.

**Speaker D:** Alright, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Much peace and love.

**Speaker B:** Yes, have a good day, have a good night, whatever you want.

**Speaker A:** Adios brothers.

**Speaker D:** Alright, peace.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by Speaker A (Mike) with Sangha friends including Speaker B (a traveler recently in India and Turkey) and Speaker D (DJ), revolves around practical, everyday application of the Dharma, particularly through the lens of **gladdening the mind** and finding **satisfaction in the present moment**.

Here are the key themes and takeaways:

**Core Practice: Gladdening the Mind & Present-Moment Satisfaction**
*   The central practice discussed is not passive observation, but actively **gladdening the mind** and generating an inner sense of well-being and ease.
*   The goal is to cultivate **satisfaction (*sukha*) here and now**, independent of external conditions. This is framed as the direct antidote to dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).
*   The method is simple: notice dissatisfaction arising, then consciously **"look and change"** your perspective to find contentment. This is a moment-to-moment practice of renouncing unwholesome states.

**Practical Examples & Insights**
*   **Speaker B's Experience:** He shares how this practice helped him navigate cultural transitions (from India to Turkey) and everyday awkwardness (like a confusing grocery store interaction). Instead of being disturbed, he could smile and let go, realizing his inner peace was unchanged.
*   **The Power of a Smile:** The group discusses a genuine smile as a powerful Dharma practice and a form of authentic connection. It’s not a forced gesture but a natural radiance of a gladdened mind, which can positively affect others.
*   **Simplicity Over Complexity:** There is a strong emphasis on **direct experience over complex doctrine**. Reading profound texts (like Nagarjuna's works) is less important than the simple, repeatable act of returning to the breath and gladdening the mind. The best "book" is your own mind.
*   **"Nothing to Get, Nothing to Get Rid Of":** A recurring theme is the "winner's attitude" of contentment. The practice isn't about acquiring something or aggressively eliminating hindrances, but about recognizing that in the present moment of awareness, there is already nothing lacking and nothing to reject.

**Critique of Conventional Approaches**
*   The conversation gently critiques more conceptual or devotional approaches:
    *   **Bodhisattva Vows:** The conventional vow ("May all beings be enlightened before me") is reframed. The practical approach is to start by wishing for the happiness of those immediately around you, embodied in simple acts like smiling.
    *   **Prayer vs. Action:** Wishing for all beings to be happy is seen as less effective than the immediate action of cultivating your own satisfaction, which naturally leads to harmless, compassionate behavior.
    *   **Ritual vs. Result:** While acknowledging the value in practices like Tibetan Buddhist rituals or chanting mantras (e.g., Om Mani Padme Hum), the group stresses that the true measure of any practice is whether it leads to **present-moment satisfaction**. If it doesn't, it's missing the point.

**Overall Tone & Conclusion**
The talk is informal, friendly, and grounded. The participants reinforce that the Dharma path is **"remarkably simple"** and **"user-friendly."** You don't need to be a perfect practitioner, a scholar, or an ascetic. The path is about continually returning to a baseline of contentment with what is, right here, right now—whether you're drinking fancy coffee or Dunkin' Donuts, traveling the world or in your own room. The ultimate "precious jewel" is this ever-available capacity for satisfied awareness.

**In essence, the summary is:** A practical discussion on transforming daily life through the immediate, accessible practice of gladdening the mind to find satisfaction in the present, emphasizing direct experience over doctrine, and authentic kindness over conceptual ideals.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Dharma practice, mindfulness, and satisfaction. Here are the key ones:

### Metaphors:
1.  **The "Backpack" or "Warm Blanket" of Dharma:** Speaker B describes the inner peace and constant availability of Dharma as a precious jewel. He then expands this into a metaphor: *"you're wearing a backpack all the time on you. And it's kind of becoming a blanket, a warm blanket around you."* This illustrates how the practice is a portable, comforting, and ever-present source of solace.
2.  **"Praying with my legs" (Frederick Douglass story):** Speaker A references abolitionist Frederick Douglass's autobiography, recounting how Douglass said *"I prayed all the time, and then I only started to become free when I started praying with my legs"* (by running away). This metaphor critiques passive wishing (e.g., "may all beings be happy") and emphasizes that effective action is more important than intention alone.
3.  **"Baby Dukkhas" as Nutrients:** Speaker A refers to minor dissatisfactions as *"baby dukkhas"* and says they are *"more nutrients for the Dhamma, for the soil of our mind."* This frames small sufferings not as failures, but as fertile material for growth and transformation through practice.
4.  **The "Winner's Attitude" vs. the "Loser's Way":** Speaker B recounts Dhammarato contrasting two approaches. The "loser's way" is the conventional Bodhisattva vow (*"may all living beings be happy... I should be the last one enlightened"*). The "winner's attitude" is wishing others to be *"as happy as I am right now."* This reframes compassion as radiating from a place of current satisfaction, not future self-sacrifice.
5.  **Coffee as "Good Enough":** The discussion about Dunkin' Donuts coffee versus premium coffee becomes a metaphor for contentment. Speaker A says his coffee is *"good enough,"* and Speaker D extends this: *"whatever coffee we're currently drinking, this is enough."* It's a lesson in finding satisfaction in the present reality, not in ideal conditions.
6.  **Visualizing Soccer/Football Goals:** Speaker A uses the metaphor of an athlete visualizing scoring a goal to discuss spiritual practices like chanting or visualization. The point is that these techniques are only useful if they lead to a tangible result (satisfaction/gladdening the mind *now*), just as visualization only helps if you eventually score goals. Otherwise, it's just mental activity.
7.  **"The best book we can read is between our own ears":** Speaker A uses this metaphor to emphasize that direct, personal experience and introspection are more valuable than reading complex texts. True understanding comes from looking within, not from external sources.

### Stories/Anecdotes:
1.  **The Tibetan Monastery Routine:** Speaker B shares his visit to a Tibetan monastery in Karnataka, India. He describes the intense schedule of monks and nuns who spend all day *"reading, praying, doing Puja, and chanting... and they finish their day by debating."* He uses this story to argue that such rigorous, structured practices can be a healthy way to *"sculpt a new shape"* for the mind, even if others critique them as overly complex.
2.  **The Grocery Store Interaction in Turkey:** Speaker B tells a story about being at a checkout in Turkey, not understanding the unhappy cashier, and feeling initial discomfort. He then *"just felt happy not to be able to understand"* and smiled. This personal anecdote serves as a concrete example of noticing a "baby dukkha" (awkwardness) and transforming it into satisfaction by letting go of the need to control the interaction.
3.  **Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Criticism:** Speaker A briefly mentions the Thai monk Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, who reportedly said he *loved* when people spoke badly about him because it was an opportunity to practice the Noble Path. This story illustrates the ideal of using negativity as *"fuel to be satisfied here and now."*
4.  **Actresses on Instagram:** Speaker A uses the observable behavior of celebrities constantly posting selfies as a modern-day story to illustrate a universal search for external validation and attention. He contrasts this with the Dharma path, which finds satisfaction internally, without *"chasing the like buttons."*

### Overall Themes:
The metaphors and stories consistently serve to:
*   **Demystify and simplify practice:** Making it about immediate, accessible feelings (gladdening the mind, inner smile) rather than complex doctrines.
*   **Emphasize present-moment satisfaction:** Framing it as the ultimate goal and measure of correct practice.
*   **Critique passive or overly complex approaches:** Advocating for direct, embodied action over mere wishing, praying, or intellectualizing.
*   **Normalize the process:** Showing how to work with everyday irritations and imperfections on the path.
