### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, that's an interesting question about why the mind wanders away, but it's not a really valid question. About the fact is that the mind is not running away from something, it's running away just running. They, um, in the old Buddhism— I, I'm not sure how old the term is, it didn't go all the way back to the Buddha, but it's centuries old— term called monkey mind. Now the reality of monkeys is that they're probably more consistent than humans because they've got less things to jump to. I mean, they can jump to a tree, and they can jump to a rock, and they can jump to a worm, and that kind of stuff. But look how much humans can jump, okay? That our world is— that we have created is vast, and there's no end to it. But this concept of monkey mind actually Samadhi has the quality of wherever the mind lands, it's generally not satisfied. And so it jumps someplace else. So you could say in fact that the mind is looking for satisfaction and never finding it. It always brings up that song, looking for love in all the wrong places, but in fact it's satisfaction that we're actually looking for. We're looking for safety, security, comfort, satisfaction. We're actually looking to come home, to find the place where we belong, and we never find it. And so we keep searching and keep looking and keep jumping and keep jumping. Now, for the beginner, jump— intentionally going to hold some thoughts is kind of a new thing for this monkey mind. And so it's already in the great big habit of jumping from here to there, so it's not going to stay long. And so this is why the Buddha talks about applying the mind to the wholesome and then eventually learning to sustain the mind on the wholesome. But right now, the thing to do is every time you catch that the mind has wandered away, come back to the wholesome. Keep reapplying the wholesome. Keep throwing out the hindrances and coming into wholesome thoughts. Okay, if we keep practicing that, then as we're getting fairly good at it, then we can start to manage. Can I sustain this so that as soon as the monkey mind starts to wiggle, to jump, we can bring it back very quickly or immediately? Don't hardly give it more than 1 or 2 mind moments, and then we bring it back to the wholesome. Like, ah, never mind. And that way we can sustain it. But in the beginning, it's a matter of reapplying, coming back again, that the mind is going to wander away. No reason to ask any questions about it. That's not only the habit of the mind, but in a really important way, it's built into the DNA. The centuries and generation after generation after generation of humans, all of whom have been death-satisfied, all of whom have had monkey minds. You can see that it's pretty well built right into our DNA to keep jumping around and changing the subject and looking for more satisfaction and not finding it, and so looking for more. So that even when we find the satisfaction, the monkey mind doesn't even recognize that yet, because it's such in the habit of jumping and jumping and jumping. So I guess that would be an interesting answer to that question of why is— the answer is that it's built into our instincts. And that much of what the Buddha teaches is to train those instincts. Because with all of the education that you've had, you've learned to read, except that very few people can read because they can't pay attention to what they're reading because the mind will keep jumping around. Have you ever seen that happen? That you're reading something long and that you end of the page, you recognize, hey, I don't know anything that's on that page. Get to a new paragraph when we don't know what's going on because our eyes are on the page going down the last paragraph, but the mind was jumping around thinking about it. We can read something and then we start thinking about it. The eyes will continue to move around along the page but we're not really following it because the monkey mind is jumping all over the place. We've never been trained to do it. Okay, then in fact, the word concentration is often applied to this, but the word concentration has so much other garbage along with it that we prefer not to use the word concentration and instead use the word repetition. To keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. There's an actually interesting experiment that you can try. You've probably been in this situation before, but it wasn't as an experiment. And that is to have some, uh, talk going, some talk radio, some, um, uh, event happening, maybe a documentary, maybe a YouTube and at the same time reading. You've got a book or you've got an article out and you're reading and you're listening to talk. You can generally do— most people do neither one. But can you move back and forth intentionally from book to talk, book to talk, book to talk? Do it often. Enough where you're actually getting the benefit both— sorry, jump like that.

**Speaker B:** You cut out in the last couple seconds. I didn't hear the last part of what you said.

**Speaker A:** Okay, can you hear me now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, how long was I out?

**Speaker B:** Um, just like 2 seconds, 3 seconds. You're talking about switching back and forth, but I didn't hear the last part of what you said.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so going back and forth between the audio and the visual, that in fact you're using two different parts of the brain for that, that the audio system is connected to the mid-cortex, the temporal lobes or frontal lobes, what the old psychologists called the mammalian brain. Which is where most of our auditory stuff is. And surprisingly enough, almost all rules are stored as audio. So all of our Sila, Bhata, Paramasa, all the attachments to the rites, rules, and rituals are often audio, and reading is done visually. Then in fact, what we do with the reading is the words on the book are actually converted to audio.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? Interesting.

**Speaker A:** And that the more strongly that's done, then the slower the reader, because he's got to change— he's got to read every word as if it were a spoken word. And speed readers learn to read the words without it being converted into audio. Okay, so that's something that you can try to see, how the mind actually does jump back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And that means then that once you can see that, you can begin to train it. You can eventually begin to train the mind so that it can stay Let us say stay put. But let me use this analogy. This is the object and this is the mind. Okay. And most people do it like this. The Tathagata came to me. And when people try to practice concentration, they think it's what they're doing. Is pushing really hard. And the right practice is to touch, touch, touch, touch, touch, touch, touch. And in fact, that pushing very hard is what you would call concentration. But instead of really being concentrated, they push really hard and then push really hard and then push really hard, and so they're not getting anywhere, and they wear themselves out, they're working too hard. And the right way to do is to touch and to touch and to touch, and pretty soon we can get it to land there and become stable. And then we can bring it back out stable. We don't need the object anymore. The mind can just be stable.

**Speaker B:** Without focusing on anything in particular.

**Speaker A:** Without focusing on any particular thing, or that we can focus on something and focus on something and focus on something and focus on something without it jumping around. That this is the way that the mind normally works is because we're never trained. To get the mind to settle down. It's constantly jumping and jumping and jumping. And when I'm moving my finger like that, that's a kind of an indication about how fast the mind is moving. In fact, the mind is jumping faster than I can move my finger. And so this analogy may help you, is to touch, to touch, touch and to touch until you can get it stable, and then you can draw it back out and the mind will remain stable. And so this is what we're actually practicing in Anapanasati, is keep coming back to the wholesome, keep coming back to the wholesome, coming back to the wholesome, and pretty soon it's like this, and then it begins to settle down so that we can stay stable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, on that note, like sometimes I feel during my practice that the wholesome thoughts like slow down or like I don't need to think them as much and there's like I just focus on the pleasant sensations or something. Like do I need to keep the consistent wholesome thoughts coming in or is it okay if it like There's like periods in between the thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you can keep coming back, that's the way to do it. Okay, just to keep coming back. Hang on. Sure. So I'm back again. The mind was never trained. In fact, as an infant, our fingers are not trained. Have you ever seen a tender infant or a young baby, let us say under the age of one. Yep, they can't coordinate their hands. They can't— no, they can't really see anything. That it takes a long time. And then when we start school, we can't hold a pencil. We have to train the hand to do that. But for some reason in our school system, they've never figured out that it's really the mind it needs to be trained. And so we're trained to use a computer, but we use that computer sporadically because the mind that we're using the computer with is not trained. This is part of the reason why there's so many automobile accidents, is people are not paying— they know how to drive a car, in fact they take it for granted that they know how to drive a car, and so they're lollygagging, They're thinking about something, they're rubbernecking, they're on their cell phone, they're chewing a sandwich, they're fussing at their kids, and that's where the accidents happen. Actually, nowadays it's even worse than that because we have this new thing, this new kid on the block called road rage. Back in the 1950s, people were really polite with each other when they crashed into each other. And so I think that the modern society needs that kind of mental training now more than ever. And so that's the kind of a question that you were asking, is why is the mind a monkey mind? The answer is that it was never trained. It was already a monkey mind. When you were born, it was a monkey mind. In fact, it wasn't hardly functioning at all when you were born. So with that, we can recognize, okay, well, the mind does need to be changed. It needs to be trained. And the way of the training is repetition. Repetition, practice, over and over and over and over again. For some reason, that's one of the most important messages that we have.

**Speaker B:** For.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati, and so few people actually get that message. It just requires repetitive work. One of the examples I use is Arthur Rubinstein, Have you ever heard of him? He's dead now, but he was a world-famous musician. And once one woman came up to him and said to him, "I would give half my life to play the piano the way you do." And he looked at her and he mused and he said, "Yep, that's about what it costs." is about half the life. Okay, if you're willing to put half your life into Anapanasati, you will get enormous grapefruit out of it. There was actually, um, a story. He's long dead now. His name was Franz Liszt. You probably haven't heard from him unless you're in deep musical circles. And Franz Liszt was well known to be the best pianist in the world. He lived as a monk, he lived in a chapel, and he spent more than 8 hours a day practicing the piano and another 8 hours a day practicing meditation. And that kind of dedication, that over and over and over again practice, will get someone up to that world-class notoriety. That was in fact what they got from the Buddha. The reason that we remember him 2,500 years ago was because he was high-quality, world-class human being. But he had to practice. He practiced and he practiced. Every day he would sit, not doing anything, because actually, eventually the practice becomes just play. It's no longer work. It's playful, but they keep doing it. So the question is, can you begin to play with your practice, to begin to enjoy it more and more, so you spend more and more time doing it, so that you become dedicated, enthusiastic, eager for watching the mind and how it works? So that's the pep talk. Is to start spending more time doing this.

**Speaker B:** I will, I will. And that doesn't mean just formal sitting practice, right? It just means all the time.

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't have to be a formal sitting practice. You can practice on the bus, you can practice in your easy chair, you can practice in front of the computer, you can practice while you were watching TV a minute ago, you can practice while reading a book. Practice, practice, practice. And in fact, when you're reading the book, keep your mind focused on the book. Don't let the mind wander away into thinking about what's on the book. Read the book. That's practice. When you're out driving, pay attention. Look down the road, look behind you, keep your mind and eyes alert. You won't have any accidents, or very few. You won't cause them. You may get sideswiped, but that's because somebody else is not paying attention. So there's all kinds of practice. In fact, it's a well-known thing that monks who drive mindfully are very excellent drivers. There's another point about that, and that is, is that very, very rich people who want a chauffeur, do you know who they want to have as a chauffeur? Retired race car drivers. Why is that? Is because if a race car driver is good enough to ride a whole bunch of races and then get a lot of money and retire That means that he was able to pay attention. He didn't get killed out on that racetrack, right? And so wealthy people who want a driver who is very safe and can manage that limousine very well, they want to have a race car driver as a chauffeur. So they're willing to pay, what, a million dollars a year for a chauffeur? Why? Because he knows how to pay attention to the road, all right? He's trained himself to do that. Can you imagine that you're out on the Formula One, you yourself driving down the road, you know that road very well, you've checked it out, you've walked it even, and you're going around it over and over and over again, and some little old lady steps out right in front of you? If you have the thought, old lady, you ought not be in the road, you just killed her. You got to have fast reaction time. That little old lady comes out on that road, you got to get out of the way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all the current, um, Formula 1 drivers have really crazy reaction times.

**Speaker A:** That reaction time is in fact can be trained, that we get out of the way of the thoughts that we have in the way and just act immediately. And in fact, that's the same thing with those who become black belts, fourth dan, very fast reaction time, down to about 200 milliseconds. They have timed cats. Cats are down at about 65 milliseconds. Cats have very, very fast reaction time, which I guess means that they don't have much to think about. So yes, reaction time. Can you see that the mind is wandering away from that book you're reading and bring it back? Can you really pay attention to what you're doing? Really focus on it. So that would be the practice. Whatever you're doing, do it with all thy heart and mind and thy soul. Pay attention to what you're doing. Put your, put your whole moment into it, your whole life. This is correct practice. Really apply the mind. And that's a training. We have to train for that. Like in football, 99% of winning the game at football is football practice. So 99% of living one's life is practice. And if people don't practice, they wind up living a pretty messy life because their mind is all over the place, not paying attention. Have automobile accidents, they drink, they cuss. They get angry, you know, all the ordinary things. They beat their wife, they become cops, really stupid things. But when one is really mindful because they're actually paying attention, they wind up having a really good life. Great fruit, great benefit, the Buddha says, for practicing Anapanasati. So can you remember that? Can you remember that you can practice any time that you can remember?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker A:** So start remembering often.

**Speaker B:** I'll remember.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, let's go ahead and finish this call now, and you go practice.

**Speaker B:** I will, I will. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All righty, see you later.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Topic:** Training the "Monkey Mind" through mindfulness and repetition.

**Main Teachings:**

1.  **The Nature of the Mind:** The mind's tendency to wander ("monkey mind") is not a flaw to be analyzed, but a deep-seated habit and instinct. It constantly jumps from one thing to another, searching for satisfaction, safety, and comfort but never truly finding it.

2.  **The Method: Repetition, Not Force:** The practice is not about intense concentration or forcing the mind to be still. It is about gentle, persistent **repetition**. Every time you notice the mind has wandered, you gently bring it back to a wholesome object (like the breath in Ānāpānasati). This is compared to lightly "touching" the object again and again until the mind stabilizes.

3.  **Training an Untrained Faculty:** Just as we train our bodies (to hold a pencil, drive a car), we must train the mind, a skill often neglected in modern education. The wandering mind is the default state because it has never been trained to settle.

4.  **Practice is Life-Wide:** Formal sitting is just one part. True practice is **continuous**: mindful reading, mindful driving, paying full attention to whatever you are doing at any moment ("do it with all thy heart and mind"). The goal is to make mindfulness your default mode.

5.  **The Result of Training:** Through dedicated, repetitive practice, the mind becomes stable, focused, and peaceful. This leads to a better, safer, and more fruitful life. The speaker uses analogies like champion pianists or Formula 1 drivers to illustrate that world-class skill in any field—including peace of mind—requires immense, dedicated practice.

**Key Analogies & Examples:**
*   **Monkey Mind:** The mind jumping from branch to branch, never satisfied.
*   **Touching vs. Pushing:** Correct practice is like lightly touching the object of focus repeatedly, not straining to push the mind onto it.
*   **Arthur Rubinstein/Franz Liszt:** Mastery requires dedicating a huge portion of your life to practice.
*   **Race Car Drivers/Chauffeurs:** Exemplars of trained, life-or-death attention and reaction time, which mindfulness cultivates.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a "pep talk" encouraging enthusiastic, playful, and persistent practice in all activities. The answer to a wandering mind is not asking "why," but patiently and consistently training it through the repetitive application of mindful attention.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several core metaphors and illustrative stories to explain the nature of the mind and the path of meditation practice.

### Core Metaphors

1.  **The Monkey Mind:** This is the central metaphor. The untrained mind is compared to a restless monkey, constantly jumping from one thing to another (tree to rock to worm). The key point is that it jumps not necessarily *away* from something bad, but because it is habitually searching for satisfaction, safety, and a sense of "home" but never finding it.

2.  **Touch, Don't Push:** The speaker contrasts two approaches to focusing the mind using a physical analogy.
    *   **Incorrect (Pushing):** Pictured as forcefully and tensely shoving the mind against an object of focus. This is exhausting and ineffective, linked to the misunderstood idea of "concentration."
    *   **Correct (Touching):** Pictured as gently and repeatedly bringing the mind back to the object—"touch, touch, touch." This patient repetition allows the mind to eventually "land" and become stable on its own.

3.  **Muscle/Motor Skill Training:** The mind is compared to an untrained physical faculty.
    *   Just as a baby must learn to coordinate its hands or a child must learn to hold a pencil, the mind must be trained to focus. Our education system trains us to use tools (computers, cars) but neglects to train the mind itself.
    *   The practice is **repetition**, likened to athletic or musical training.

### Key Stories & Illustrative Examples

1.  **The Inattentive Reader:** A common experience where you read a page or paragraph but the "monkey mind" has jumped away to think about the content, so you finish without actually absorbing anything. This illustrates how the mind's wandering operates in daily life.

2.  **The Dual-Task Experiment:** The suggestion to try reading a book while simultaneously listening to talk audio (radio, documentary). The point is that untrained, we do neither well. The exercise of intentionally switching focus back and forth ("book to talk, book to talk") is a way to observe and begin to train the mind's jumping habit.

3.  **The Dedicated Musicians:**
    *   **Arthur Rubinstein:** When an admirer said she'd give half her life to play piano like him, he replied, "That's about what it costs." This story underscores the immense commitment (time, repetition) required for mastery, whether in music or meditation.
    *   **Franz Liszt:** Described as a monk-like figure who spent 8 hours daily practicing piano and another 8 hours practicing meditation. This exemplifies the "world-class" dedication needed to achieve profound skill and stability of mind.

4.  **The Mindful Driver:**
    *   **General Practice:** The advice to practice mindfulness while driving—paying full attention to the road—to avoid accidents. This contrasts with the common "monkey mind" behaviors like rubbernecking, using phones, or eating.
    *   **The Chauffeur Anecdote:** The speaker notes that wealthy people hire retired race car drivers as chauffeurs. The reason is that to survive racing, they have developed exceptional focus and reaction time. This connects the practice of focused attention directly to safety and high performance in a real-world task.

5.  **Reaction Time & Martial Arts:** The discussion of Formula 1 drivers and martial artists (e.g., "black belts, fourth dan") having trained reaction times (e.g., 200 milliseconds) illustrates the tangible benefit of a trained, non-wandering mind: the ability to act immediately without obstructive thought, just as one must gently but instantly bring the mind back from wandering.

### Summary of Metaphorical Purpose
The metaphors and stories work together to convey a specific philosophy:
*   **The Problem:** The mind is inherently restless ("monkey mind") due to evolution and lack of training, perpetually seeking but not finding satisfaction.
*   **The Method:** Training is not forceful concentration but gentle, patient **repetition**—constantly "touching" the object of focus.
*   **The Paradigm:** This mental training is as essential and demanding as training for elite physical or artistic performance.
*   **The Goal:** To develop a stable, settled mind that can focus when needed or remain stable without an object, leading to a safer, more skillful, and more satisfying life.
