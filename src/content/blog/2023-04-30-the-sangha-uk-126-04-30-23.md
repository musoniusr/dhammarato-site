### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh, wait a minute, it's going to show this time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's recording.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Ah, well, this is Sunday afternoon, 4 o'clock in Thailand, and that in the UK it's probably what, 10 or 11 in the morning? And I think that it's right at the end of April. This is the 30th of April. Yeah, that's what it is, the 30th of April. And Andre has just asked a question about the 10 Fetters. Andre, where did you hear about the 10 Fetters other than just reading it out of some old book someplace? Have you had any other experience? How about in Dhamma Sala? Do they ever talk about the Fetters at Dhamma Sala?

**Speaker B:** Actually, no, I haven't heard any talks given there about the fetters, but I did come across different analogies and sort of metaphors for different progressions and different stages of Srotapanna and Sakadagami.

**Speaker A:** And all.

**Speaker B:** Those things that are kind of fetter-based. And to me it made a lot of sense. How that's actually the only way, well, or one of the ways we can tell any sort of like we're moving in the right direction, that these fetters.

**Speaker A:** Are.

**Speaker B:** Loosening their grip or they disappear completely. But yeah, I heard it from a lot of different sources and it's always interesting to see what it actually means from different sources.

**Speaker A:** Well, first off, the Pali word is for what you're using the word fetter is kilesa. And there's another Pali word that's used called asava. And asava and kilesa are used kind of interchangeably in this context, but they have different actual meanings. The word 'kilesa' that is translated as 'fetter' actually means like fettering a bird by tying it to a vine or to a string. Or you would fetter an elephant by pounding a tree deep into the ground and then having very strong ropes. Made of vines to hold him down. Almost always they will fetter the right— the left hind foot, because the right foot is, you know, most elephants in the time of the Buddha were right-footed, just like we are nowadays. And so they would always fetter or tether the left hind foot. So this is where that word comes from. The word asuva It has more to do with the quality of a pox, or a canker, or a blackhead, or a pimple, or a skin abrasion, maybe a cyst, a lymphoma, that kind of thing is what the asava means. And they can be used in some cases interchangeably. For instance, the word asava is used in the Sutta number 2, Saba'asava Sutta. I mean, that's the name of the Sutta, and yet it's got the first three fetters, is the point of the first section of it. And in fact, that's an important point. The fetters are actually the method by which the students will remove the situation called the Second Noble Truth, or the cause of suffering. Okay, we have greed, ill will, and ignorance. And what we really understand later is that that list is backwards. I don't even know why it came that way. Maybe it's because the bottom line is ignorance, because that's a really important one. And so in the Sabba Asava Sutta, it starts off with knowledge. Okay, the first asava that has to be dealt with is one of seeing. And in that sutta, it talks about who I was in the past, who I was in the future, who I'm going to be. It also has the various views of self in the sense of no self knows the self, the self knows the no self, the self knows the self, the no self knows the no self. I mean, this is kind of mind-twisting stuff that the Brahmins would get into, which doesn't mean anything. And these are all referred to in this sutta as unappropriate ways of paying attention. And it's also in this regard called a thicket of views. And what is wise attention is such that things improve or are springing up and being developed, to where unwise attention is when things get worse and good things don't get started. And so after that, then it talks about, well, what is worthy of our attention? What is wise attention? And the expression goes along with it, and I'll use the new one that I've just learned. This is Dukkha. Okay, this is Dukkha, and this is what we mean by the cause of Dukkha. And this is the end of Dukkha, and then we have the method or the way to reach that. Okay, so this is Dukkha. This is the cause of Dukkha is what this really is all about. And because this is the cause of Dukkha, there is a way of stopping that causation, to stop conditioning things. And when things are unconditioned, they settle down. Just like the engine will cause the rear tires to run because the engine has gasoline, when it runs out of gas, now the engine is no longer the asset, it becomes a liability, and the car comes to a stop because it's unconditioned. The wheels stop running because they're unconditioned by the engine, and the engine is unconditioned without the gasoline. So this is That's what we mean by conditioning. And so, when we can see the conditioning, when we can see the causation, what is the cause of the suffering, which is these three things: greed, ill will, and ignorance, then because we can see through understanding and practicing the Eightfold Noble Path and coming out of it, we then come to three understandings And that is personality view, clinging to rights, rules, and rituals, and the elimination of doubt. I have just given you the three asavas that are listed in that sutta, but these are also the first three vetters. And it is normally referred to in, let us say, low-class ordinary widespread Buddhism The ending of these three fetters is the determination of what makes one a Srotapanna. Have you ever heard of the word Srotapanna before? Okay, do you know what it means other than the silly translation of stream-enterer? It's more like jumping into the flood. So, the stream entry means that we become completely immersed in the Dharma, we don't care about anything other than the Dharma. Once the doubt about the Dharma, what is the Dharma and what is not the Dharma, we're pretty secure into it. It's really life-changing, it literally Shanghais you, you're drafted, you got to go, except that this is almost a mandatory thing. And so one of the ways of looking at it, if you understand this way of looking, is that one who is ordained is probably close to being a Srotapanna. I mean, why would he ordain if he didn't care enough about the Dharma to change his whole life? So just because he's in the robes, that's a pretty good guess that he's on that path. Now there's a whole lot of reasons for people to ordain and in Thailand, hiding from the law, doing what mom told you to do, you know, that kind of thing. But that almost never happens with Westerners. And so almost all the Westerners that you ever meet, you got to give them credit for the fact that they've actually cared enough about the Dhamma to ordain, even if they don't even understand the Dhamma yet. They care enough about it. Okay, so the real Srotapanna though, back to these fetters, is that we can see that the second fetter and the third and the first fetter are intertwined. They're interrelated in the sense of who you are is based upon who you were supposed to be. You picked up a lot of rights, rules, and rituals along the way when you were a child. To define who we are. And so we're supposed to live up to the standards of who we are. And so who we are is based upon a set of rules, but that's also the base of where all of our suffering comes from, in the sense that we either have the rule and rebel against it, or we have the rule and we try and we fail at it because the rule's too high a bar, that our standards are set too high. And in other cases, there are no standards and we just go screwing around because we don't have any standards at all, and messing up that way. So, the definition of who I am really has another kind of component to it, and that is that if we think that who we are is who we are, that we've got some sort of destiny, or that is extraordinarily difficult to change, then people don't make much progress, if at any. That in fact, you can see in some cases that the job of cleaning out the past is a pretty big job, but we can do it. But then you add rebirth to that, and now I have to clean out the junk through what, how many thousands of lives in the past that have determined who I am? And that makes it such a big, daunting kind of thing. But even if people believe in rebirth and reincarnation, they kind of throw it aside because it's irrelevant anyway, and decide that they can change, that we do not have to go the way that we're going, that we can change. This is really a big, important point about a change model, because the normal personality is, "I can't change." I've got a destiny, I'm not supposed to change, I can't do it. And in fact, religions make a big point of it, that you can't change. Who are you to be good? Only God is good. You need a Jesus because you can't do it yourself. You've got this big burden of all of this past and all of this future, and somehow or another it's determined by outside forces anyway. A god or gods, or maybe a Kamma machine, or something out there that is controlling our lives and controlling our existence. This is part of personality view, which basically the responsible one, the authority, is just part of the superego anyway. It's just how high up into the mind does it go but it's still the guy who sets the rules. And the reality is, is no, we're the ones who set the rules. We picked them up when we were kids. There's nobody up there setting the rules for us, that the rules that we set for ourselves we got from our parents. But there is nothing inherently actually real in the sense of good or bad. Good and bad are all a matter of opinion. There are some ones that are universal, like I don't want to have my arm broken, but arms get broken in fights. So during those moments, that's a good thing. You've got a broken arm, now you can't hurt me with it. Okay, so goods and bads, they're not set, but we try to set them. We try to determine what's good and bad, what's right or wrong. And that limits us. This is the Sila, Vata, Paramasa, is the decisions or the criteria upon which we set bars and set standards. And the Buddha has a particular one that we can throw out all of the rights, rules, rituals, laws, ways of doing things, all the society and all of that kind of stuff, and take on one new rule that tends to work. In fact, it's just a little rule. It's an easy rule. It's the rule that actually defines the entire teachings of the Buddha, and that is the rule, the standard that we're going to live by, is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's the new standard, okay? And so we can throw the fetter of all of those rules out. Well, when we have just one rule, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, then that means that the set of rules don't define who you are anymore. You become much much more natural. But you're a moving target, you're constantly in motion. There's no fixed 'you' there anymore, because the rules were what defined you. The box that you were in was just merely a cage. And when you take the cage down, then you've got freedom. Okay, so let's look at doubt for a moment, because doubt is the third fetter, and we need to really understand what it is, that in fact there's various levels of doubt, that some of them we had to get over to get where we are. You could say in fact that the three fetters, that third one of doubt, actually is overlaid with the first fetter and the second fetter. So the way that it goes is, in the beginning, the question is, the doubtful question is, who can I get to fix me because I'm broken, I'm a victim, I need a god. No, that don't work. I need a teacher. Nope, that didn't work. I need a mommy. I need a nanny. I need a bottle to drink. I need a drug to take. I need, I need, I need, I need in order to feel good. This is the first doubt that we have: what can I do to feel good. Guess what? There's nothing out there that's ever going to do that. And we have to come then to the conclusion of that doubt is nothing. There ain't no help. I'm gonna have to do it myself. That's kind of terrifying for some people. In fact, that's the second level of doubt, because the first level of doubt is actually coming out of the seed of Ataparamita. So we've got to have a rule saying somebody's responsible here for my mess. Guess what? There's no rule specifying who's responsible for your mess other than you. And so the second fetter is, how can I get out of this? Or a more important question is not how so much, because that's the third fetter, but rather, can I? Am I capable of getting out of it? And this is when real practice starts. That people who have that first doubt, they're not practicing, they're out looking for somebody to do their meditation practice for them. Maybe they can go to a retreat, pay big bucks, and then the retreat center will do the meditation for them, and they don't have to do anything, they just pay the money. Same thing happens with psychologists: "Oh, I paid this psychologist $300 an hour, hour after hour, it's his job, you know, I paid him." He's got to do his thing. I paid for my therapy and I expect results. So you can hear that first fetter deeply embedded with that, and people have to get past that before they can ever come to the teachings of the Buddha, because the Buddha is actually all about these Four Noble Truths. And that second one is, hey buddy, this greed, ill will, and delusion is all yours all the time. An example of that, by the way, is that in 2004 there was a huge tsunami out in the Adriatic or Indian Ocean, and that Phuket just almost got washed away. Literally thousands of foreigners were in it. But the surprise is, is that hours before the tsunami happened, the elephants in Phuket all headed for the hills. One of them in particular was already up in the hills, and his trainer, his manuk, was bringing him down the hill back to the quarters, and that elephant would not go. He would not go down the hill. And this trainer was working for hours trying to get this elephant to go down the hill. And guess what? Here comes all of the other elephants up the hill. This is, by the way, is on the video that I've seen. And behind all of those elephants were all of the trainers trying to catch up and find the elephants because the elephants had all busted down their stalls and left. This is very interesting. How did the elephants know that a tsunami was coming? How did they know that? Probably the answer is that they were sensitive and barefoot enough that they heard the ground rumble, and they say, I'm out of here. But the people could have possibly felt the same thing, and they didn't notice it. They weren't paying attention. So this is basically what we're talking about in that, in the sense of ignorance, is that we're not watching. So the question is, all of those of Parang who got injured due to the tsunami, was it in fact due to their ignorance, or did God do it to them? What do you think, Arhat? Is there something magical? I mean, I mean, the tsunami got a whole bunch of people. That must be really powerful, like a god would, you know, cause an earthquake. Who's responsible for all of those people who got hurt?

**Speaker C:** Probably lack of, like, how do you say, ignorance, I'd say.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. So each one, the problem was each one's ignorance. Okay, so now let's go back to the Saba Asava Sutta to see in fact that that's what it's working with, that when we can see through personality view and see through all of our rights, rules, and rituals, then we come to the point of saying, "Hey, I can do this myself." And that's where we practice. In fact, by having the concept or the idea, "I can do it myself," and every one of you had that. I think you had that idea before you ever called me, any of you. You had the idea that, "I can do this." Most people don't. They can't. They're still looking for someone to do it for them, even though they know nobody's going to do it for them, but they still don't think that they can do it for themselves. But here everybody is at least hoping and thinking, "You can do it yourself." So now we begin to practice correctly, and guess what? We can begin to feel satisfied. We can begin to practice correctly and get the results in it, and part of the benefit of that is, the success goes up, and then that firms that point in, that "Yes, I can do this." It makes it strong. Yes, I can do this. And so that's that second layer of doubt that's erased. But along with that is the correct practice, is we also come to understand the knowledge and vision of what is the path, the Eightfold Noble Path, and what is not the path— everything else I've ever done. Everything else I've ever done didn't work, it didn't make me happy, but the Eightfold Noble path works. So let's stay with that. Okay. That's in fact, that doubt is what then puts that person on the spiritual path for sure, without a doubt, because they know without a doubt that the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha works. And yet so many of the Buddhist practices in the Western world don't even refer to the Eightfold Noble Path and how important it is. And yet there it is right there in the suttas talking about you have to do this, these Four Noble Truths, you have to practice the Eightfold Noble Path to find out for sure that that's the right one. Because everybody's got doubts about, is this the right path? I mean, how many students have you talked to? In fact, how many different practices have you even tried, each one of you? Because you doubt it. But now we're coming to one that works well enough that we don't doubt it anymore, that we know that it works. Cleaning out the mind and getting satisfied and then getting that kind of wow sensation, working with the body, working with Anapanasati, is a system that works. And so this brings around then that third better. Which is also known as the third knowledge. If that's the case, then in fact what I'm talking about now is I'm moving out of Sutta number 2 into Sutta number 48. And in Sutta number 48, it talks about there are in fact 7 knowledges that bring about the Sotapanna, not just the eradication of doubt, the knowledge and vision of actually what is correct, the path, and all of that stuff that's not. In fact, that particular quote comes out of Sutra number 24, which is a good companion for Sutra number 48. They both have 7 steps along the path. So the point then is that once we have laid that foundation of knowledge, knowledge of the present moment, knowledge of being able to control the feelings, knowledge of being able to control our greed, to control our anger. Not absolutely fully in control of it, but the knowledge that we in fact can do that. We've got the skills to do it. What are the skills? The Eightfold Noble Path skills, you know, we've got to remember. We've got to take a look, and we've got to make a change, and we've got to enjoy the change. So those are the points that bring the mind into the state of unification, and that that unification of mind is available to the Srotapanna. But let's make a distinction so that we can understand. First off, there's two kinds of Srotapanna. In fact, this phrase, these two kinds, are well known and distributed. One is called the path of the Srotapanna, which is what we've been talking about, and then the fruit of the Srotapanna, which we haven't started talking about yet. So the Sabbāyasippa is only actually talking about the eradication of those fetters. But it's not the full Srotapanna yet, it's only the first step, the first path. That in fact, you could go so far, because of the way that the Suttas are described, as the actual first step, or the first actual point on the path, is when the student knows for sure, without a doubt, that he can come out of the obstructions, no matter what obstructions, no matter what hindrance, no matter what situation, he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he can change his mind. Now this is the first step of the Srotapanna, okay? But it's not the full eradication of the doubt. He still has the doubt, but he knows at least in this moment he can clean out his mind. Later, he begins to understand that this has got to be the way of life. So now we come up to the fourth knowledge, and this is a doozy. This is one that I secretly teach on a regular basis, but I don't really mention it, but it's in the suttas in the sense of the way the sutta talks about it is that the young monk goes to Paddy Mawk. And makes a confession, and that the confession is so that by the time that the Pātimokkha is to be read, there are only a Sangha of pure-minded people. Because the young students, they're afraid to go to the assembly. But when you get up the guts to go to the assembly and actually confess your wrongdoing to a senior teacher, or to a senior friend, someone that you trust, and you confess. You get it off your chest, whatever we've done wrong. Now, in our society, we're actually taught by our parents and all the other people to hide our wrongdoing. You're not— it's okay to do it, just don't get caught, right? Here If we can confess it, that means that we're willing to see it as Dukkha and are willing to do something about it. So this is where the next step— in fact, this is the midpoint now between the path of the Srotapanna into the fruit of the Srotapanna. This is the balance point, is when you're willing to look at your wrongdoing, when you're willing to love yourself warts and all, when you're willing to actually see what it is that needs to be fixed and do so in a loving, happy way. That it's okay to confess and get it off our chest with the idea that, hey, I don't have to do that anymore. It's painful. It's painful. If even if nothing else, it's painful to get it off his chest. It's painful to be honest with ourselves. Because why? Because we're not living up to the rules and the standards that we made for ourselves. And so we begin then. This is where we begin to take down those real barriers that we learned about through knowledge, is now we're going to do something about it. We're going to see Dukkha as it is and throw it out as Dukkha, Nirodha, rather than harboring it and keeping it to ourselves and not willing to confess And so this is part of the reason why it's really very quick path for those who are ordained and actually will practice this and to become honest and get stuff off the chest. It's liberating to carry around all of our troubles and all of our malfunctions and all of our upsets, all of our errors. We're human, we make mistakes. Can you forgive yourself? Can you get over it? This is that fourth item. This is a true knowledge. You can see how important this knowledge is, because without this, there's no next knowledge. We have to learn to take it as it comes, real, and accept reality as it is. This is actually This is kind of the endpoint of all the lies. We, after this stage, the dude doesn't lie much anymore. There's no reason to lie to anybody. I'd rather see the truth and get it over with and get it done, be honest with it about it, because I'll probably get caught lying later anyway, and then I'll make an enemy because he caught me lying. It's better to be truthful in the first place. So, the next step, step 5 then, is when the Dharma itself becomes the guiding principle. The Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha now is our way of life. And there's two examples in the sutras. One is that though the young monk is going about his monkly duties, like sweeping the hall, sweeping the pathway, still he's thinking about the Dhamma. The other example here, kind of interesting one, is the cow has just calved and she's got a brand new calf, several days old or so. And while she's eating grass, she's got one eye— they say one eye on that calf. That calf is not out of her field of view. She's watching that calf. She's also stationing her body to where, like, the woods are way over there, and so she'll station her body between them. Any place that she perceived possible danger, she's going to get in the way of it to protect that infant. Okay, this is a way that we can also see as protecting ourselves. By having that higher mind or that agent that I've talked about, or the frontal cortex, or the adult in the room, is to wake up and let the adult take care and nurture the deep little child that we have inside, rather than being critical of the child, that we begin to nurture ourselves. Okay, so this is step 5, where the only thing that we care about is the Dharma, and the feelings are always pleasant, nurturing, that kind of way. Now the 6th step is right on his heels sometimes, and this— the word here that's used is the word eager, enthusiastic. To become enthusiastic about the Dharma. The only thing that we care about is the Dharma. When we're reading books, Let's read some Dharma books. When we're watching videos, let's see what the monks are saying. This kind of thing. We begin to get interested in the Pali. We're enthusiastic for the practice. It's working so well. I mean, look at all of the other steps up to this step 6. This is just almost there, because we've got nothing but enthusiasm for it. We're totally dedicated to the Dharma. There's like nothing much else to do but let's just go do another retreat, or let's just hang out at the water, let's just, you know, sit here and do nothing. That's probably the best thing, just to sit down and do nothing and enjoy the heck out of it. And that's the next step, enjoying the heck out of it. This is actually step 7. The word that's used are words in the Pali like rato and nandi and that kind of word, which has to do with the quality of delight, that we see things in the sense of being surprised at how beautiful it is, surprised at how wonderful the Dharma is. I mean, this stuff works! And we have that delightful kind of, "Wow, this is so good!" And these are the 7 knowledges that finally, profoundly put a student to the point of being the fruit of the Srotapanna. And what is the fruit of the Srotapanna? Being delightful, being delighted, being enthusiastic and eager, being honest with yourself, being completely free from doubt, and also the ability to practice the Eightfold Noble Path correctly. So now we're really ready to play, to do the Eightfold Noble Path. And what is that? That's going on from the first three fetters into the fourth and the fifth fetter. Now, what are the fourth and the fifth fetter? Well, let's go back to this, to the the second of the Four Noble Truths for a moment, and recognize that the fourth and the fifth fetter are actually that greed and ill will, but now we've got the wisdom, now we've got the tools to deal with it. That's why the third and the fourth, or the fourth and the fifth fetter, is because we really can't deal with anything until we can get our hands on it. When the room is dark, the example that I will use is that a black cat is in a completely blackened and darkened room except for the door. And you open the door, you walk into the room and you close the door and it is pitch black with a black cat in that room. It's got furniture and all kinds of stuff that you've never been in. And so you likely stumble around on the furniture and your job is to catch that black cat. You know how to do that? You sit down in the middle of the floor and wait, and the cat will come to you, either to sit on your lap or scratch your eyes out, but be ready. Okay, so from that perspective, you can see that It would actually be a whole lot easier to catch that cat if we put some light on the subject, if we really knew what the habits of that cat were, knew where, you know, our way around the room, etc., like that. And so most of the people in the world just sitting in the middle of their life waiting for the black cat of paradise to come sit up on their lap, and it don't happen so well. But if we can catch that cat, if we know how if we know our way around. And so this is that, uh, these— the next letter is, is how we practice in the sense of seeing these unwholesome thoughts, thoughts of greed, and throw it out. Thoughts of ill will, and throw them out. And you can say, well, wait a minute, we're doing that all along. Why do I have to wait to be a Sotapanna to do that? And then the answer to that question is Duh, of course. We practice all of this stuff in the moment, right now. The very first time a student sits down to practice, he can go all the way to Srotapanna and back by getting rid of those unwholesome thoughts and getting rid of those fetters in the present moment and feeling really good about it, delightful, delighted, understanding the Dharma for a short period of time, and then he falls back into his normal existence, probably while he's still sitting there. And so don't think of these things as a long process, but rather something to look at, that these things are real. Now, these five fetters that I've just talked about are normally referred to as rupa in the sense that they're real. And the arupapettas, there are 5 of those, and what those are actually in the sense of is they're not real, they're conceptualized, but they're very, very strong within us. Okay, what do I mean by that? Well, actual desire, actual greed, actual hunger is a physical sensation that we have to deal with. Okay, that's real. Also, being in real danger, being attacked, we don't like that. So these are the kind of real things, and it's really built deep into our DNA. And so that's why there are so many false positives to where we wind up wanting things we don't need at all, but we want them really badly. And then feel bad because we can't get it, or we have false positives of, uh, ill will. I, I don't like a whole lot of stuff because I don't like this, and it's associated with that, and I don't like that too because I don't like this, and now this thing over here, they're pretty well connected, so I don't like it too. All right, an example of that is now within the United States, the Democrats are in the point, uh, it doesn't matter what it is, if it's got the label Republican on it, I hate it. And if I'm a Republican and it's got the Democratic label on it, then I hate it, right? That's because of that association that's not real. So now let's look at the 5 betters, the high 5, that actually are kind of underlying and kick things off, or, uh, are shown in certain kinds of behavior. The first one that we can look at is restlessness, that not only is restlessness a fetter, but it's also a hindrance. It's the same thing. Restlessness is restlessness, except that restlessness as a hindrance is the restlessness that we feel right now. The high fetter is the propensity to be restless, which means now we're looking at the deeper stuff like agitation, worry, and fear, because fear is at the bottom line with this. Okay, so now that we've gotten down to that level of fear, where does the fear come from? Let's look at two other high fetters. These are called Arupa Raga and Rupa Raga. Anicca. And basically what that means is, do I cling to reality in a certain way, or do I let it go? And we all— we're all going to die, we're all going to have to let stuff go. The question is a matter of timing. But these, these two fetters are so deeply interrelated, they're really just one fetter, and that is the the cycle or the vibration of our 'do I stay or do I go.' There's even some songs. I've got an old song about it. It was a Jimmy Durante song that was used in the Conehead movie later. Have you ever had the feeling that you wanted to go, you wanted to go, and you wanted to stay, stay, go, go, stay? Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. I go, I stay. Okay, so it's a little bit longer than that, but that's that conflict that we have within ourselves that goes back and forth around that cycle of I like it, I don't like it, she loves me, she loves me not. It's part of the confusion itself, is this cycle of the fear, the fear of staying and the fear of going. But it's all based upon fear, and when that cycle is running, that's where the agitation and the worry and the restlessness come from. They're all interrelated. Now, there's another way that we deal with fear, and that is the Pali word for it is Panna, and the word Panna actually means the word conceit. But we don't really use it like that. A better way to understand it is competition. That we compete, and we compete in order to win or lose. And each time that you compete, you're already setting up the rule system in advance, based partly on your feelings, as to whether the outcome of this competition, you're going to win it or you're going to lose it. But we compete. So that we can feel pride, or we compete so that we can feel either jealous or envious. Those two words, by the way, are interestingly related. Envy is when that girl has the guy I want, and jealousy is when that girl wants my guy. Do you get the distinction? But they're both pretty closely related. One of them already has it and doesn't want to lose it, and the other one wants it really bad and can't get it. But this is jealousy and envy, which is the other side of pride, and they're both concoctions based upon this competition. So one of the things that we can start doing when we're out in the world is to recognize that I'm not going to compete with people. Anymore, that we can be friends instead. They're not enemies, they're not people that we need to go to verbal war for. We don't need to do any arguments. Oh, Andrew left, huh? Okay. So, when we have no competition left, then we can relax. When we have no fear left, then we can relax. Well, we could do that again in the first hour of meditation. It doesn't take years to do this, but we do it whenever we need it. So begin to recognize when you get into the sense of you want to compete with somebody, you want to prove them wrong, you want to get your way, you want to compete with them. Because always, regardless of what you do, the outcome is either on one side or the other— pride or jealousy and envy. And so we can recognize, hey, I don't have to compete anymore. That in fact, we can think of it as kind of a mathematical formula, like an equation they call it. And they have equal, greater than and equal, or just greater than, or less than, or less than and equal, right? Have you ever heard that in mathematics? Well, we do that with other people. We go around judging other people: "I'm better than they are." Or we go around judging people: "I'm not as good as they are." And the answer is, let's stop comparing ourselves to other people. That in fact, we don't have to use the equal sign, because we're not equal. Things are too complicated, you got to set some criteria here. How many different criteria do we have? Do we have a whole long list of things and I do all of my stuff on that list and you do all of that stuff on your list? How are we going to compare those to see who's the better person? It's impossible. That we're in a state of delusion when we're comparing ourselves to other people. They're who they are and we're who we are. So we need to even take that equal sign out of our equation. In fact, the only sign that I can think of that belongs in there is the heart sign. That I love you. Not I'm better than you, or I'm less than you, or I'm equal to you. No, we're friends here, we're in this together. So, this is how we come out of that competition and comparing ourselves, and also complaining. We stop complaining. Part of the reason we can stop complaining is because we've already figured out that ain't nobody going to help me, that if I'm feeling bad and I want to complain about it, I'm the one who can fix my bad feelings, and then I don't have to complain anymore. The example of that is going into some department store, or maybe Walmart. They've got a complaint department, and those poor people behind that counter have to deal with people complaining when they return stuff. The question is, can we Dhamma dudes walk into that complaint department, give them the toy that's broken or whatever we're returning, happily? Do we have to complain when we're in the complaint department? Huh? Can we? Can we be happy even when we're returning something without having to complain. So this 'mana', this complaining, competing that we do with other people, we can bring that to a stop once we see it. That in fact, we can see that it does have greed and ill-will built into it. And so there's one last fetter. Let's take care of that one, because this is one that's interesting. And that is the last fetter, the 10th fetter, is the fetter of ignorance. Well, wait a minute, we started off with ignorance. We got some knowledge, we got cleaned up. What's all of the ignorance now? The ignorance is basically everything that you don't know that you want to know. Everything that you want to know is in fact everything that can be known. We want to know everything. We want to know all about it. And yet, human knowledge is too big for one person; it's probably too big for 100 people. That in fact, you could go to, let us say, the Dean's Ball, where all the old elderly college professors are there, and what are they going to do at the Dean's Ball? They're going to argue with each other, because they don't have enough knowledge. And they try to show off, they compete with each other, and because of that they don't learn. And so all of those college professors, each one of them is a specialist in his own regard, but all of the other 35 or 40 college professors there, they're also in their own world of knowledge. And there's nobody in that room that knows everything that everybody else knows. There's nobody like that. It's not possible. And yet we want it. Every one of us, we hunger and thirst after knowledge. We finally ever come to the question of, when is it enough? When do I know enough? And the answer to that is, when I have enough to be in a state of well-being, when I have enough to be happy, when I have enough to be okay. That's all I need to know. I don't have to be full of knowledge. In fact, I've got way too much knowledge. I know far too much. And when I forget it, when I'm trying to remember a name, then I feel bad. If I never knew Charles Dickens' name in the first place, I wouldn't feel bad because I forgot it. Now how's that for knowledge? Yeah, knowledge becomes an enemy, that there comes a point in time when we don't need any knowledge, we don't need any more information, that it's okay that we don't know, that in fact in this place is finally that place where ignorance finally is bliss, is where the room is absolutely cleaned out. It's still got some dirt in there, but it's clean enough. We don't have to get it perfect, we don't have to know everything. And so these are the 10 fetters, and when we can come to the point that we are under control, or we are in control of these fetters— how do we do that? It's through Sati, by waking up, knowing what to look for, seeing that stuff, recognizing it, throwing it out. And so the full 10 fetters— I mean, everybody's got the idea that it takes years to go through the 10 fetters. Well, you know, like 40 years for the first 5, and then the next 5 after that, well, lifetimes it takes. No, this all happens in the here and now. This, these cycles can run pretty fast. We could repeat it over and over again so that all of it comes together in that practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, then in fact that point about waking up and recognizing that I want to know something and it's hard to find and I'm suffering, and I can say, well, right now I don't need to know that, I'll look it up later if I remember, but right now I don't need to know that, I'm okay. But how many of you have done it the other way? You think of something that, oh, if I knew that, I could meditate better, and then off you go trying to figure it out. And you don't even need to know that. We only need to know just a few basic things. That's all we need to know. Enough already. We can't get it all. It's like going to a big huge buffet at a hotel And you can say, well, I can have all the food. You can't have all the food you want. Your belly's not big enough, just like your mind is just not big enough for all the things you want to know. When is it enough? Do you have to get— actually go to that buffet and get really so much food and so you're feeling really hard? I mean, I have gone into those kind of places when I was a young man. With the intention of putting them out of business. I never put anybody out of business. I put myself out of business. I would walk away. Oh, it hurts. I ate too much. But I've done that with knowledge also. And so this is the end of that fetter. The end of all of the fetters is when we feel satisfied. When we feel satisfied, we don't need to know anymore. When we're satisfied, we don't have to worry about coming and going. When we're satisfied, we don't have to compete or compare or complain. Everything is all right already. When we are satisfied, we can go down now to the other fetters, down to the lower ones. I don't have to hate people. I'm already satisfied. I don't have to want things that I don't have. I don't want anything. I'm satisfied already. And so at that level, that satisfaction, that Sukkha, that word is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha. This is the opposite. Getting us ourselves into that state of Sukkha finishes all the things. Immediately. But they're good to look for when you find them, because they're not going to be gone immediately every time. They're going to be there. It's good to look, it's good to pay attention, it's good to recognize that you really want to teach somebody a lesson when they're not about to learn the lesson you want to teach them. Dads do this with their sons, sons do this with their dads. Students want to teach their teachers something; the teacher wants to teach that kid a lesson; the cops are going around trying to teach people lessons left, right, and center. Our whole society is based upon teaching people a lesson. Those Republicans are working hard to teach those Democrats a lesson. Can we come out of that? That's the better. Is to try to teach somebody a lesson. You're going to wind up feeling really bad no matter what. So, those are the Ten Fetters. Yes, Andre, go ahead, you've got your hand up.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] That makes a lot of sense, everything you mentioned. I have a practical question. For example, Okay, what would be the factor in striving for tranquility, for example, right?

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker B:** Being, for example, in a city and there's lots of going on and there's lots of people and etc., etc., but really just wanting to be in peace and wanting to to, I don't know, to go to nature and to a cave and to just meditate, there's still a striving there. But is it rupa or is it arupa, right? So there is a craving there, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, there sure is, and back and forth in fact, because if you really wanted to go out of that city, noisy clatter, into a quiet place, you'd go. But here you are standing in that noisy clatter wanting to be quiet, and it's not quiet. Okay, so all of this stuff that we've been talking about, there it is in practicality. You want to stay and you want to go. At the ultimate end, by the way, I didn't even bother to mention it, that's life itself. Are you going to live or you want to die? This is the question that Hamlet asked: to be or not to be. Let's prick ourselves with that poison sword and be not be for a while. So, but it's also in there, I don't like this particular life's moment, I want out of here, but I don't, I stay, I don't go. Okay, so you want the quiet, you want to go away from the quiet, but you don't. And so now you're in a state of dissatisfaction and you want tranquility. And what you could say is that I want something that I can't have right now. I think that in fact that what I don't like is all those people out there, where in fact what I'm actually doing is that I'm following the rule about shalt not be noisy when we want to be quiet. All right, that those people are out there not following your rule. If you can give up the rule and say, hey, this is a pretty noisy place that I'm in right here, but I'm— it's okay with me. I don't have to try to make these people different or try to make myself in a different place. Can I come to be— is this good enough? Am I satisfied with this noisy environment? Because you're not leaving anyway. Why not just get used to it and satisfied with it? Isn't that amazing? All you have to do is just get used to it, enjoy it a little bit, begin to listen to it as if it were in fact music. There's probably some repetitions in there someplace, some clickety-clacks, some butcher hacking meat that you can hear, you know, all kinds of parts of abilities of what we can hear. But because we don't like it, we want to push it away, we want to be away from it. And because of that, we're now not paying any attention to it. But in fact, this noise situation that you're talking about is exactly the situation that I was talking about in Step 4, is that we do not want to see our own problems in our own mind. We want to make it somebody else's problem. We want to make the environment noisy, that's the problem. No, that's not the problem. The problem is I don't like it. And I've got control over how, whether I like stuff or not. I've been practicing pretty good at it. And I can stand here and say, well, I can handle this. Yeah, you guys noisy away. Party on, folks. I'm okay. That's the attitude that we can develop with that, that we don't have to blame the others, that we can in fact recognize the Second Noble Truth is through by looking at, hey, this unhappiness is my concoction. I made this stuff up because I've got a rule about noise. And if you throw that rule about noise out, then you don't even hear it as noise. It's just sounds, and we can enjoy that. Or we can not pay attention to it because we're neutral to it one way or the other. We just don't care. And coming into that 'I don't care' attitude— I know that that sounds really gross in our society, but that's really what clinging is all about, is caring. And when we stop caring about stuff, we can set it down and we don't have to carry it anymore. But here you are carrying that noise, and you called it noise, and you're carrying it around. You still got it today. How many days ago was it that the noise was there? You're still carrying the noise, and you can not care anymore about noise and just let it go. Set it down. I don't have to carry their noise around anymore. Not my problem. And then you can just boogie on down that street. You can have a ball. You don't need anything. That— because you've got your attitude straightened out. And see, in that regard, now that we've got that point straightened out, it's easy And now we don't have to go with that come and stay and stay and go, and I don't like it, and what do I go, and I'm not leaving, I'm staying here and hating it. You know, you don't have to keep going through all of that cycle of stuff. You can cut right through that and say, hey, I'm here by my choosing, and I also choose how I relate to this noise. It can either be a friend of mine or it could be my enemy. So the next time you guys get into a noisy situation, reflect upon this, that you don't have to let that noise be noise. It could be music. Up to you. Anybody else?

**Speaker B:** I think about, about this the other day. I'm currently in Sikkim.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Yes, you said you were going And.

**Speaker B:** Traveling around here, they have the shared taxis, which is the only way. There's no buses. So they have these huge jeeps and they're packed like sardines with very little Sikkimese people. And so when I get in there, it's like 5 people per row and the rides are very long. And I was really witnessing this discomfort and then realizing that the only— yeah, I can make friends.

**Speaker A:** You were the only one in there that was uncomfortable. Everybody else was okay and they had to put up with this giant among them that's taking up all the room.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Where you were sitting in the back, but they're good with you. Okay, here's something that I know from real experience about India is that their boundaries, their spatial boundaries, are very small compared to the Westerner. The Westerner, especially Americans, they want to keep their distance. You know, it's actually— I think it goes back to the cowboy days, to where we're about to have a gunfight and we want as much distance between us as possible so it's hard for him to hit me. That I don't want that guy to get too close. Okay, that's in fact what the handshake is all about, is getting close enough and touching him to figure out that he does not have a knife up his sleeve. That's one of the things you should check for. That's why you shake his hand, is so you can check to see, is he armed? Okay, so here we go with that mentality and keeping our distance and having our space. And you go to India where they don't even have that concept. They pack in like sardines. It's okay with them, been that way their whole life. I mean, Mom lived in this one room and had 10 kids. So all 11 of them were growing up in that room. They're okay with that. They don't know nothing else. But you walk into that room, you can't even find a place to put one foot after another to get over to the wall. All right, so that's something I learned. That was a hard lesson for me to learn when I was in India. I learned that one. Yeah, let them pack in there. They're like sardines, and I can get used to to it. They're noisy too, by the way. Yeah, so they're close-knit and noisy. So you're in India, you chose to be there. Get used to the way that it is, figure out what you don't like about it and change that so that you can enjoy your experience. It's a lovely place to be. It's just got some stuff that some Westerners, we just don't like. The way that they do stuff.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, does anybody else have any questions? How about you, David? Anything to say?

**Speaker D:** I, uh Not much, but early in the talk you mentioned confession and Buddhist monasticism. I'm wondering also, like.

**Speaker A:** Is that a.

**Speaker D:** Thing for lay people too? Like, do they ever like confess things to the monks?

**Speaker A:** That, yes, confessing to the monks, yes, that's a regular occurrence. Yes, that's right. They go to their senior monks, they lay all of their problems out. In fact, the monkhood has been the family therapist and psychologist here in Thailand for centuries. And in fact, the thing that's quite notable is that psychologists and psychiatrists don't do well here in Thailand because the people generally don't need that level and sophistication of stuff. They get straightened out at the Wat. Yes, absolutely. The next thing about the lay people is that also you can live your life as a layman but still have that dedication to the Dhamma. That's quite not just possible, but I would say that that's the most common thing. In the time of the Buddha, most of the people who came to him went away saying, I will be a supporter of you and live the Dharma. You will be my teacher for the rest of my life. And that happens often. But almost equally as often, I come for ordination. I'm ready. That in fact, there are several occasions when the guy said that they were ready, and the Buddha says, "Well, go get a robe and a bowl." There's in fact one story of where the guy, he was really sharp, and I think the circumstances was that the Buddha asked a farmer if he could stay in the barn, and the guy said, "Yeah, but there's already somebody staying in the barn." And they spent the night together, and the next morning they had a conversation, and this guy was ready to go. And so the Buddha said, you go get your robe and you go get your bowl. And he got killed the day he was out to get his robe and bowl. That's the story in there. So that's one of the things that in the time of the Buddha, all you needed was the robe and the bowl, and that you could ordain. He didn't have any of the rules that are associated with the proper ordination that the Theravadas have developed. Developed with all that Pali chanting and stuff. That came centuries later. But come and see Ayya Pasiko, come. That was the ordination. If you got your robe and bowl, come. That was it. But a lot of people were householders in the sense of property owners. They had people that they were responsible for. They had employees, employees and children and farmland and all of that kind of stuff. And the Buddha's advice to them is to sit out on the porch and let your wife run your business, and you just sit there and just practice Dhamma. You don't need to be a monk. You can be a householder and still just sit here and do nothing. And let them do all the work. That's basically how I live here in Thailand. I've got a family and they do everything, boy, I don't have to do anything. But, but, uh, Tam also knows that I'm pretty much into the Dhamma and she appreciates that. And so she knows that it works out, so she's just willing to do it all. Everybody has a wonderful life like that, if the guys who were in families, the men, would just shut up and sit down, and let the family run itself without his trying to order people around. You don't have to be a daddy like that. Just take it easy. By the way, this is in the Dhammarato, number 31, where the advice to the layman is to let your wife run the show. There's also a Mullah Nasruddin story. Mullah Nasruddin, the little book about his stories is very common in India, is probably one of the most favorite old joke books that they've got. You might know about it. If you've been to India, uh, and, uh, Andrew, do you know about Mullah Nasruddin? Okay, it's got many, many stories, and one of them is, is that, um, a group of people, uh, came to him for advice about death, and, and they were, they were saying, um, Well, what do you do? And he says, oh, I only do really important things. And I let the family do all the unimportant stuff. And he says, and then they ask him, oh, what do you mean the most important things you do and the family does all the important stuff? He says, yeah, I let my wife choose what kind of car we have. What kind of house we live in, what school the kids go to, what kind of clothing they wear, what kind of furniture we have, you know, all the really unimportant stuff. She takes care of the bank account, she does whatever she wants. And they said, well, you do the important— what do you do? And he says, well, I sit here and talk to God. I sit here and commune. I do the really important stuff, to keep the family going by doing nothing. So that's actually part of the Anicca tradition also, of the daddy's quitting, stop running the family, stop running the family business, and chill out and stay at home.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I've been trying to implement this with my wife, but she's Western.

**Speaker A:** And it's a little— all the Western wives are— it's no, no, no, no, no. It really is easy because the Western women, they really do want to be in charge. They've been suppressed, they've had glass ceilings, all kinds of stuff. They even have to wear high-heeled shoes and wear makeup and lipstick. I mean, poor Western women are so trounced. So every time that she says something to you, all you have to do is say, yes dear, do as you please. It's okay. And just let her go and do what feels— if she tries to argue with you, you can't argue with her. You say, "You're right. Yeah, I am a stupid buffoon. Let's get over it." And just let her have her way. Your life will just turn beautiful that way. In fact, I've got several students that are practicing that, and they all agree that it's the best way to have a relationship is just let the wife just do everything she wants to do, and that way you don't have to do nothing except the Dhamma, because that's all there is. David, did that answer your question well enough?

**Speaker D:** Yes, very good. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, because we could go into some detail, but I think that that's, that's, that's the way of looking at it, is it doesn't matter whether you ordain or not, but the ordination and in the robes, that's a pretty clear sign that somebody cares enough about the Dharma to put on their, you know, to shave their head and put on that robe and live with the other monks and all of that kind of stuff. That's a pretty good indication that he cares about the Dhamma. He cares about it. But you, with your shaved head and your white shirt, that's the same thing in Thailand. That just shows that you really care about the Dharma.

**Speaker D:** Yes, going from retreat to retreat, that's.

**Speaker A:** Another indication you really care about the Dharma.

**Speaker D:** Yes, it's pretty easy to ordain, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so, and it's pretty easy to.

**Speaker A:** Disrobe too, so and ordain again. You see, the Western mentality has the concept of the Catholic Church as an example of the acolyte. He's either got a choice, he's going to do his full ordination or he's out. And so he does his full ordination, and after that he's in for life. If he gets out, he's excommunicated and all kinds of big troubles. I mean, they really have a bunch of rules about that stuff. But the Buddha had a rule too. Actually, it wasn't a rule, it was an example. The example was set that one monk disrobed and re-robed 7 times. So that's now the official limit, that anybody can robe and disrobe and re-robe again 7 times.

**Speaker C:** Do you have to have a good reason to disrobe? Or is it because maybe you want to go back with your family for a moment?

**Speaker A:** Okay, I can, I can say several reasons. One, and the one that's officially the, uh, the one that's, uh, is the most positive, is because your family needs you. That even though the— I mean, even the guy sitting on the porch, sometimes he has to get up and go to the field to help his people because it's time to work. And sometimes the family requests that the monk come and do some family business. I've had that. In fact, it has to do with the request of the mother. The tradition is that the mother, and to a degree your father, but mainly the mother is the one who gives permission for you to ordain. And if she wants you to not be ordained, you come out. She's— you give that your mother that level of courtesy, that she's the one. If she needs you out, you come out. If it's okay with her, you go in. Then you can go in. By the way, this was all done in writing for me. Achan Po, he really requested— I didn't get ordained until he saw the letter where my mom gave permission. Another way of coming out is when a sweet young thing comes to the back of the place, grabs the monk by his robes, and carries him out of the wat by his pecker. I think you know what I'm talking about. In fact, in Thailand, the way that it works is that the Thai women are taught from childhood to respect the monks. Don't go into the private areas. Don't touch a monk. Stay away from them. And that's become a major tradition because that gives the monks the freedom to stay away from the women. Because the women's not— but Western women will come into the wat, see that young Western monk and how beautiful a human being he is, and she says, I want him.

**Speaker D:** Mine.

**Speaker A:** And about 6 months later, that happens. And I've seen that happen several times. And that's officially the worst reason to come out of the monkhood, is for relationship. But it happens. Let's see. Oh, there are other ways would be like the cops come and get you. You see, in the Catholic Church, when laypeople say that guy's a crook and we want him, they will hide the guy. But within Buddhism, the— if it's— if the wrongdoing is kept within the Sangha, then that's so he can be rehabilitated. But if the police or the laypeople come after this guy, this guy who's wearing orange robes, he's not really a monk already because he's caused that kind of trouble. And so they'll just let him go. The monks will not argue with lay people if someone— if they came. This is one of the reasons why, in order to be ordained in the first place, you cannot be in debt, you cannot be wanted by the police or anything like that. You've got to be completely free, including from your mom. You've got to be completely free in order to ordain. Okay, so this is another reason why people leave the monkhood. But the worst, I would think, that in fact you could say, even though in society, getting out to getting laid is pretty bad, the real one is when the guy, like in the sutta number 12 in the Lion's Roar Sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya, is where this guy goes out, disrobes, and starts trashing the Buddha. Oh, he don't know anything. Okay, and so going to another religion or coming out, uh, of— because you didn't understand the Dharma at all and you want to go look to see what other religions have, then that's a big no-no in the sense of you probably won't come back. And if he did, he probably won't be invited back. Because he's not part of the order. But having to leave because a girl got you, or having to leave because your mother needed you, those are legitimate reasons for getting out of the Sangha. But the most important, or the most legitimate, is for your mom to request that you leave the Sangha for her, or the family's benefit in some way. So it's very little to do with Catholic teaching. They've got a different system together. This is much more freedom-oriented. And it's good for people to know this in the West, because we've got all of these ideas about ordination from the Catholics. So how's this for you, uh, David? Does this help also with it? It's a swinging door. Yes, you can come in and out. Easy come, easy go.

**Speaker D:** Yes, uh, there's one Westerner here at this retreat center. Uh, he's, uh, he's not present on this retreat. I've been told he was on the last retreat, but, uh, he just ordains, uh, he's ordained 3 times. Already. He just comes for the rains retreat to ordain, and then he disrobes after the rains retreat, and he keeps coming every year.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go let him do that. Yeah, I think there's sometimes— in fact, Thais do that every year. They've got to go work in the field, but there's 3 months or so that they'll like to ponzha, which is basically from sometime in September to sometime in November. That, that time range is very convenient for for the Thais to ordain again, for Panza. Yeah, so here you've got an example already of what I'm talking about, and it's a Westerner too. So, Lon, you haven't said much of anything. Are you good with all of this?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I really enjoyed the talk. Very, very clear, and everything about the ordination too is very valuable and reassuring in a way, because it can be a bit frightening when thinking about ordination, you know, as this big commitment. So it's good that you opened up some ways of how it's done.

**Speaker A:** It's good.

**Speaker C:** Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** All right, Andrew, do you have any parting words?

**Speaker B:** No, thank you very much for the talk. The Katha explanation hits the spot, and then the wife advice is also very nice. So thank you so much. It was very clarifying.

**Speaker A:** Okay, excellent. Are you dragging your wife around India? That's no-no.

**Speaker B:** No, no, I'm not dragging. She actually loves India. No, but she's in Dharamsala and then in Goa during the winter. But I tend to run around a bit and I'm not dragging her with me.

**Speaker A:** Good. I'm just teasing you. Anyway, guys, it's so good to see you. Thank you all. I really appreciate this.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, is a deep and practical exploration of the **Ten Fetters** (*saṃyojana*) and the path to becoming a **Sotāpanna** (stream-enterer). Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Theme: The Ten Fetters & The Path to Stream-Entry**

The talk uses the framework of the Ten Fetters not as a distant, theoretical map, but as a practical, moment-to-moment guide for meditation and daily life. The central message is that progress is about **seeing and releasing these fetters in the present moment**, not about achieving distant, lifelong stages.

---

### **Key Points Explained**

#### **1. The First Three Fetters (The "Lower" Fetters)**
These are the fetters whose eradication defines a Sotāpanna. They are deeply interconnected:
*   **Personality View (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*):** The belief in a fixed, permanent self. This identity is built upon...
*   **Clinging to Rites and Rituals (*sīlabbata-parāmāsa*):** The rules, standards, and "shoulds" we inherit (from family, society, religion) that define who we think we are. We suffer when we fail to meet them or rebel against them.
*   **Doubt (*vicikicchā*):** Uncertainty about the path. Dhammarato breaks this down into layers:
    *   **Layer 1:** Looking for an external savior (god, teacher, drug) to fix us.
    *   **Layer 2:** Doubting *our own ability* to do the work.
    *   **Overcoming Doubt:** Comes from **direct experience** using the Eightfold Path. When you see for yourself that you can change your mind, release greed/ill-will, and find satisfaction, doubt in the Dhamma vanishes.

**The New Standard:** We replace all old rules with one guideline: **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"** (Suffering, the Cause of Suffering, the Cessation of Suffering). This fluid standard frees us from the cage of a fixed identity.

#### **2. The Practical Path: The Seven Knowledges**
Dhammarato outlines a progression (from suttas like MN 48) from a beginner to a firm Sotāpanna (*sotāpatti-phala*), emphasizing it can be experienced in cycles, even in a single sitting:
1.  **Knowledge you can change your mind** (release hindrances).
2.  **Knowledge & vision of what is and is not the path** (the Eightfold Path works).
3.  **Knowledge that you have the skills** (to apply the path).
4.  **The "Confession" Knowledge:** Honesty with yourself and a trusted other. Letting go of hiding faults, loving yourself "warts and all." This is a major turning point.
5.  **Dhamma becomes the guiding principle** in all activities, like a mother cow protectively watching her calf.
6.  **Enthusiasm for the Dhamma.** It becomes your primary interest.
7.  **Delight (*rati/nandi*) in the Dhamma.** A joyful "wow, this works!"

This sequence culminates in the **"fruit" of stream-entry**: a mind free from doubt, honest, delighted, and skilled in the Eightfold Path, ready to tackle the next fetters.

#### **3. The Remaining Fetters (The "Higher" Fetters)**
With the foundation of stream-entry, one can more effectively work on:
*   **Fetters 4 & 5:** **Sensual desire (*kāma-rāga*)** and **Ill-will (*vyāpāda*)**. Now you have the light (wisdom) to "catch the black cat" of these defilements.
*   **Fetters 6 & 7:** **Desire for fine-material (*rūpa-rāga*) and immaterial existence (*arūpa-rāga*).** The deep-seated cycle of "to be or not to be," clinging to existence itself, rooted in fear.
*   **Fetter 8: Conceit (*māna*).** The tendency to compare and compete (better than, worse than, equal to). The solution is to replace comparison with a "heart sign"—metta (loving-kindness).
*   **Fetter 9: Restlessness (*uddhacca*).** The underlying propensity for agitation, worry, and anxiety.
*   **Fetter 10: Ignorance (*avijjā*).** The final, deep-seated not-knowing. A key insight here is learning when **knowledge is enough**. The endless thirst to know everything is a fetter; peace comes when you know *enough to be happy and well*.

#### **4. Practical Application & Attitude**
*   **It's About Now:** The fetters are to be observed and released **in the present moment**. You can touch stream-entry and backslide in a single meditation session. The path is iterative.
*   **Dealing with Discomfort (Example: Noise):** A student's question about noise in a city illustrates the practice. The problem isn't the external noise but your **rule** ("it should be quiet") and your **reaction** ("I dislike this"). By dropping the rule and changing your relationship to the sensation, you can find peace *within* the noise. The Second Noble Truth points inward: "This unhappiness is my concoction."
*   **The Role of Satisfaction (*sukha*):** The ultimate antidote to the fetters. When the mind is truly satisfied, desire, ill-will, and restlessness fall away.

#### **5. Ordination & Lay Life**
*   **Ordination as a Sign:** Taking robes is a strong external sign of dedication to the Dhamma, often indicating one is on the Sotāpanna path.
*   **Flexibility:** In the Buddhist tradition (unlike the Catholic view Westerners may hold), ordination is not a lifelong prison. It's acceptable to disrobe for compassionate reasons (e.g., family need) and re-ordain. The worst reason is leaving to pursue a relationship or to disparage the teaching.
*   **The Householder Path:** One can practice deeply as a layperson. The ideal, humorously presented, is for the husband to "sit on the porch," let his wife manage worldly affairs, and dedicate himself to Dhamma practice—creating harmony and peace in the household.

### **Overall Tone & Teaching Style**
Dhammarato's teaching is:
*   **Sutta-based:** Rooted in the Pali Canon (referencing specific suttas like MN 2, MN 48).
*   **Practical & Psychological:** He translates Pali terms into relatable mental patterns and daily life challenges.
*   **Encouraging & Demystifying:** He insists profound progress is accessible here and now, not after lifetimes.
*   **Humorous & Direct:** Uses anecdotes (tsunami elephants, Mullah Nasruddin), modern analogies (Walmart complaint department), and blunt advice ("yes dear, do as you please").

In essence, the talk is a roadmap for using the Buddha's teaching on the fetters as a **real-time toolkit for liberation**, emphasizing self-reliance, joyful perseverance, and the transformative power of seeing things as they are.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, primarily the Ten Fetters and the path to becoming a *Sotāpanna* (stream-enterer). Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Fetters (Saṃyojana) as Physical Restraints:**
    *   **A bird tied to a vine/string:** The Pali word *kilesa* (often translated as defilement, linked to fetters) is compared to tying a bird down, preventing its freedom.
    *   **An elephant tethered by a stake and ropes:** Specifically, the left hind foot of a (typically right-footed) elephant is fettered. This illustrates how the fetters bind and restrict our natural potential.

2.  **Cankers/Influxes (Āsava) as Bodily Afflictions:**
    *   **Pox, canker, pimple, cyst, lymphoma:** The word *āsava* is described as a kind of corruption or oozing sore within, a different but related metaphor for the causes of suffering.

3.  **Conditioning as a Car Engine:**
    *   **Engine, gasoline, and tires:** Suffering is caused by conditioning, like an engine (cause) using gasoline (fuel) to turn the tires (effect). When the fuel of craving/ignorance runs out, conditioning stops, and suffering ceases—like a car coasting to a stop.

4.  **The Dharma as a Guiding Principle:**
    *   **A mother cow protecting her calf:** A practitioner who has made the Dhamma their central concern is like a cow eating grass but always keeping one eye on her calf, positioning herself between it and any danger. This symbolizes constant, protective mindfulness.

5.  **Dealing with Hindrances in a Dark Room:**
    *   **Catching a black cat in a pitch-black room:** Trying to deal with greed and ill-will (the "higher" fetters) without the light of wisdom is like stumbling around a dark, unfamiliar room trying to catch a black cat. The wise method is to "sit and wait" (cultivate stillness and awareness) until the cat (the hindrance) reveals itself.

6.  **Knowledge as an Overwhelming Buffet:**
    *   **A huge hotel buffet:** The craving for limitless knowledge (a form of ignorance) is like piling too much food from a buffet onto your plate. It becomes painful and unhealthy. The key is to know *when you have enough* to be satisfied and happy.

7.  **Comparison as a Mathematical Equation:**
    *   **Greater than, less than, equals signs (>, <, =):** Our conceit and tendency to compare ourselves to others is framed as a mental equation. The speaker suggests replacing these with a "heart sign" (❤️)—moving from competition to compassion and connection.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The 2004 Tsunami and the Elephants:**
    *   **Story:** Elephants in Phuket sensed the tsunami coming, broke out of their stalls, and fled to high ground hours before the wave hit, while their human handlers were oblivious.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate **ignorance** (*avijjā*)—the humans weren't paying attention to subtle signs in their environment, just as we often ignore the causes of our own suffering.

2.  **The Monk and the Confession (from the Suttas):**
    *   **Story:** A young monk confesses his faults to a senior before the *Pātimokkha* recitation, ensuring the Sangha is pure. The act of honest confession is liberating.
    *   **Purpose:** To highlight a key step on the path—radical honesty with oneself and others, and the willingness to "love yourself warts and all" as a means to shed the weight of hidden wrongdoings.

3.  **Mullah Nasruddin and "Important" Work:**
    *   **Story:** The Sufi fool/jester Mullah Nasruddin tells people he lets his wife handle all unimportant decisions (house, car, kids' school, finances) so he can focus on the truly important work: sitting and talking to God.
    *   **Purpose:** To humorously underscore a point about lay practice from the *Siṅgāla Sutta*: one can be deeply dedicated to the Dhamma by relinquishing control over worldly affairs, finding peace by "doing nothing" while the household runs itself.

4.  **The Quick Ordination and Sudden Death (from the Suttas):**
    *   **Story:** In the Buddha's time, a man understood the Dhamma so perfectly after one conversation that the Buddha told him to go get a robe and bowl to ordain. The man was killed on his way to get them.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that ordination in the early Sangha was about genuine understanding and commitment, not ritual, and that the opportunity for practice is urgent and precious.

### **Recurring Analogies & Imagery**

*   **Personality View as a Cage/Box:** The rules and standards we inherit create a cage that defines a fixed "self." Enlightenment is taking the cage down for freedom.
*   **The Cycle of "Stay or Go":** The inner conflict of attachment and aversion is compared to an old song ("Do I stay or do I go?") and the children's game "she loves me, she loves me not."
*   **Noise as a Choice:** A noisy environment isn't the problem; our **rule** that it *should* be quiet is. We can choose to hear it as an unpleasant noise or simply as sound, even as "music."
*   **Westerner in a Crowded Indian Jeep:** The physical discomfort comes from the Western cultural "rule" of personal space. Letting go of that rule allows one to be at peace in the crowded reality.

**In summary,** the speaker uses **concrete, physical metaphors** (tethers, sores, engines, buffets) to make abstract mental fetters understandable. He employs **stories from suttas, modern events, and folklore** to illustrate key principles like ignorance, confession, and non-attachment. The overall effect is a practical, relatable, and often humorous exposition of the path to awakening.
