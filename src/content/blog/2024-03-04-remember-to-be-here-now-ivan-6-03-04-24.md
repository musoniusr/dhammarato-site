### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Reason to go for goals. Go for the process. Just like I said about Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha, the Brahma Viharas are seen as an outcome. Good practice. The good practices is to brighten the mind, to gladden the mind, to remove unwholesome thoughts, to be nurturing to yourself. And by doing that, the natural outcome is going to be Metta. Natural outcome as opposed to the goal.

**Speaker A:** Just so I understand the nuances.

**Speaker B:** Is.

**Speaker A:** How is making the unwholesome to wholesome not a goal? I understand it's a process, but sometimes I misunderstood I feel that if I'm in an unwholesome, I kind of judge myself, like I do so, I didn't achieve that goal. I understand there's a misunderstanding from my part, so I'm trying to understand.

**Speaker B:** Well, you just said it, so I guess you understand it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's tricky.

**Speaker B:** We don't need goals. What we need is to be satisfied right this moment, no goal involved, no future involved. Okay, then in fact, a goal— having a goal means that right now you don't have the goal, which means that you're wanting something you don't have.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And so that's why the senior monks will talk about let's not have goals, because goals is Dukkha. Wanting something you don't have. Let's be satisfied with the way things are right now.

**Speaker A:** It kind of sounds like when Buddha— when Buddha was enlightened, he doesn't have a goal. It's just he gave up that goal.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point. Was that he strived and he strived and he strived to get the goal, to be enlightened or whatever like that, and then he gave up the goal. And that was in fact the enlightenment, is to give up the goal. Like in sports, to just enjoy the game. They say it doesn't matter who wins or loses, is how you play the game. Which means the game itself, the playing of the game, is the enjoyment, not the goal at the end of who won and who lost at the end of the game. But are you enjoying playing the game right now? The game of life, in this case.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** You've heard the old joke, maybe, that in life, who wins and who loses is the guy who wins is the guy who dies with the most toys.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Instead of looking at how much he enjoyed playing with the toys he had.

**Speaker A:** Yes. It makes so much sense because I realized over the past weeks or months, every time I had this sense of dissatisfaction, it's because my mind slipped into this wanting to achieve this goal. But when I stopped thinking about the goal, focus on the process, it's very easy to get out of dissatisfaction. Satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** It's just— it's easy to bring in satisfaction when we see that all I wanted to go— I want to be enlightened. Don't try to be enlightened. Enjoy yourself instead. Be satisfied with what you have.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** It's actually a beautiful practice that way, is just to give up the goals.

**Speaker A:** Someone told me this, and I don't really have a clear answer, but it makes sense. He said that— I said something about suffering is not getting what? It's not getting what you want. And then he also said suffering sometimes also getting what you want. And it got me thinking, it's like the goal may be a delusion. I don't know, it's just funny.

**Speaker B:** That's the problem is the word suffering. A much better definition is the word dissatisfaction. And often we get what we want, but we're dissatisfied. Yes, even when we get what we want, part of that would be the thought of, oh, I've hurt somebody to get this. And so even though I've gotten the object that I wanted, I'm still dissatisfied. Wanting the object was dissatisfying, and now getting the object is dissatisfying. And now you got to keep the object to make sure that nobody steals it from you, and so you're dissatisfied while you've got the object. And then you lose it, and now you're really dissatisfied. Oh, poor me, I lost that thing that I wanted.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and that can be anything. How about a world championship in boxing? Muhammad Ali, he wanted that title, he got the title, and then he lost it. And he didn't like that a lot. And so he started back and he got the title again. But in the process of him keep getting the titles that he kept losing because he wanted them so bad, he wound up with Parkinson's disease because his opponents beat his head in.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if he had been satisfied with getting the title one time— I'm the world champion for the day, that's enough—.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** But we— if we want something and we get it, then we want to keep it, and we're going to lose it. Yes, everything is temporary. Instead of being satisfied with the things that are temporary, let's start practicing being satisfied with whatever happens. That's the practice, is just to be satisfied with whatever is happening right now.

**Speaker A:** I once asked Arahant Kat about the idea of Samadhi, how do I get there? And he said, wanting to get there is a problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, wanting to have Samatha is a problem, but in fact, gladdening the mind and feeling good about yourself, that is Samatha. Okay, what is that Samatha then? Samatha is actually defined correctly as organization or unification of mind. All right, but if the mind wants something, then it's not whole. So if you want Samatha, automatically you're not Samatha because you want it. But when you're satisfied without Samatha then you've got Samadhi. You've got unification of mind when you're satisfied and whole and everything is known. But when you want satisfying, when you want to be satisfied, when you want to have Samadhi, then you're wanting something you don't have. And you're dissatisfied, the mind is divided. It's divided between what it is and what it wants.

**Speaker A:** So my current understanding, at least the practice, is I can be aware if I want I can be aware when I want to get out of suffering or whatever, but I also don't need to feed into that. At least that's my understanding, because I read a lot about the suttas about the idea of the raft getting across the shore. It's okay to have some wise wanting. So maybe I'm confused in that sense.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's the point then. In that simile of the raft, the simile of the raft is in Sutra 22, which is also the simile of the snake. And in fact, the simile of the raft and the simile of the snake are twins. They go hand in hand. Okay, if you grab the Dhamma or grab a snake by the wrong end, it's going to turn around and bite you.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right, so once you become satisfied in this very moment Then we don't need to carry the raft around with us, making it a temple, making it a shrine. The Dhamma is to be lived, not worshiped.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I completely agree with not carrying the raft, but Shouldn't we at least use the raft before we get there?

**Speaker B:** Well, that would be then the practice of gladdening the mind. The practice of gladdening the mind, refreshing the mind, making the mind satisfied, and once the mind is satisfied, keep that satisfaction. But we don't have to.

**Speaker A:** Make a.

**Speaker B:** Big deal out of the raft. And in fact, that's a good point about why people will practice for hours and hours every day, year after year after year after year. They're still carrying the raft, and part of the reason why they're carrying the raft is because they haven't gotten the benefit of the raft. Okay, so let's use this analogy with it. When a musician is learning a new piece of music, he practices that slowly. Yes, make sure that he's got the fingering correct, making sure that he's got every note correct. And then he speeds it up. Okay. And after the practice session, he goes out to perform it. But there's a stage beyond that, and that is that when he learns that music so well, he doesn't have to think about it or practice it anymore, or he doesn't have to think about the audience and doing it correctly for the audience, which is the performance, rather he's just sitting there playing. He's just having fun.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's what it means by not carrying the raft around, is that we move from practice, which we do in the beginning, and then we go out in the world and we practice or perform the Dharma. But once we get very good at the Dharma, now it's very playful. You don't have to work at being playful. You're just playful. And so the raft, then, that simile of the raft is actually the simile of the work is over. The job that needed to be done is done, so we can set the work down. Just enjoy the journey. Just enjoy the trip now. Or as I often say, just enjoy the show. We're no longer a performer. We're an observer. We just watch. We just enjoy the show. We get off stage, we're no longer a performer, don't have to show off for anybody. It doesn't matter what it is, just enjoy your life, just enjoy the show. So that's what the simile of the raft means. Thanks for asking, that's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for answering. It also sounds like enjoying the show is also enjoying what kind of— because I've been thinking about my emotions a lot lately, something about this idea of just observe whatever's coming up. Like, if I seem like I can't, I mean, I become the witness and then not really identify with it. Would that be the same analogy? Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes, just enjoy the show, just enjoy the music. I don't have to be the owner of the stage. I don't have to be the stage manager. Just enjoy the show. Taking that identification out of it. I don't own this place, I'm just visiting.

**Speaker A:** Would that— would that be the same if something about my practice, like some days, well My practice has been going really well, but some days my practice can be a bit like not well. So I could— well, here's the difference.

**Speaker B:** Is that you're judging it now. Instead of saying, oh, it's not going well, we can just say, oh, never mind, start again.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Just enjoy what you've got right now instead of comparing it with what you had yesterday.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's like keep coming back to this moment.

**Speaker B:** Like, just come right back to this particular moment. That's all we have to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think I got it now.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll talk to you later then. Glad to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all righty, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this dialogue, the core teaching of the Dhamma talk can be summarized as follows:

**Central Theme: The Trap of Goal-Oriented Practice and the Liberation of Process-Oriented Satisfaction.**

The conversation, led by **Speaker B (likely Dhammarato)**, deconstructs the common spiritual pitfall of striving for future goals (like enlightenment, deep samadhi, or perfected loving-kindness) and instead advocates for finding satisfaction in the present moment of practice itself.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Goals are Dukkha (Suffering/Dissatisfaction):** A goal inherently means you lack something now. This "wanting what you don't have" is a primary source of dissatisfaction. The Buddha's own enlightenment is reframed as the moment he *gave up* the goal of enlightenment.

2.  **Outcomes vs. Process:** Wholesome states (Metta, Samadhi) are natural **outcomes** of good practice, not goals to be grasped. Good practice is defined as the immediate process of: gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, removing unwholesome thoughts, and being nurturing to yourself in the present.

3.  **The Analogy of the Game (and the Raft):** Life and practice should be approached like playing a game where the joy is in the playing itself, not in who wins. This connects to the Buddha's simile of the raft: the Dhamma (the raft) is a tool for crossing the river (suffering). Once across, you don't carry the raft; you let it go. Over-attachment to the "practice" itself can become a burden if you never experience the liberation of simply "enjoying the show."

4.  **Satisfaction is the Practice:** The direct and accessible practice is to **"be satisfied with whatever is happening right now."** This doesn't mean passive resignation, but a active turning of the mind towards contentment with the present conditions, which unifies the mind (samadhi) by ending the division between "what is" and "what is wanted."

5.  **From Performer to Observer:** Advanced practice shifts from being a diligent "performer" of techniques to becoming a relaxed "observer" or someone who simply "enjoys the show." This means letting go of identification with and judgment of experiences (good/bad practice sessions, pleasant/unpleasant emotions) and continually returning to the freshness of the present moment.

**Practical Guidance Offered:**
*   When you notice dissatisfaction, check if your mind has slipped into goal-wanting.
*   Instead of judging an "unwholesome" state or a "bad" practice day, simply note it and start fresh, right now.
*   Don't try to *get* samadhi or metta. Do the things that gladden the mind, and those states will arise naturally.
*   The path is about moving from striving, to practicing, to playful enjoyment of life itself.

**In essence:** The talk encourages a profound shift from **future-oriented striving** to **present-moment satisfaction**, framing this shift not as a passive giving up, but as the very essence of effective practice and liberation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several core metaphors and stories to illustrate the difference between goal-oriented striving and process-oriented satisfaction in spiritual practice.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Sports Game Metaphor**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The joy is in the process, not the outcome.
   *   **Quote:** "They say it doesn't matter who wins or loses, is how you play the game... But are you enjoying playing the game right now? The game of life, in this case."

### 2. **The "Toys" Joke / Metaphor**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The trap of accumulation and goal-seeking versus enjoying what you have.
   *   **Quote:** "The old joke... that in life, who wins and who loses is the guy who wins is the guy who dies with the most toys. Instead of looking at how much he enjoyed playing with the toys he had."

### 3. **The Story of Muhammad Ali**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The suffering inherent in wanting, getting, and then fearing the loss of a goal (even a supreme achievement).
   *   **Quote:** "He wanted that title, he got the title, and then he lost it... he wound up with Parkinson's disease... if he had been satisfied with getting the title one time... that's enough."

### 4. **The Simile of the Raft and the Simile of the Snake (from the Suttas)**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The Dhamma (teachings/practice) is a tool to be used skillfully and then let go of, not an object to cling to. Using it wrongly (like grabbing a snake by the tail) can cause harm.
   *   **Quote:** "The simile of the raft and the simile of the snake are twins... if you grab the Dhamma or grab a snake by the wrong end, it's going to turn around and bite you... The Dhamma is to be lived, not worshiped."

### 5. **The Musician Learning a Piece Metaphor**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The progression from diligent practice, to performance, to ultimately playful mastery where the technique is forgotten.
   *   **Quote:** "When a musician is learning a new piece of music, he practices that slowly... then he goes out to perform it... once we get very good at the Dharma, now it's very playful. You don't have to work at being playful. You're just playful."

### 6. **The "Enjoy the Show" / Theater Metaphor**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The shift from being an identified performer/manager of one's life to being a satisfied observer or witness.
   *   **Quote:** "We're no longer a performer. We're an observer. We just watch. We just enjoy the show... I don't have to be the owner of the stage. I don't have to be the stage manager. Just enjoy the show."

### 7. **The Implicit Story of the Buddha's Enlightenment**
   *   **Used to illustrate:** The paradox that enlightenment came from giving up the striving for it.
   *   **Quote:** "He strived and he strived and he strived to get the goal, to be enlightened... and then he gave up the goal. And that was in fact the enlightenment, is to give up the goal."

---

**Summary of Core Message:** The talk consistently uses these metaphors to contrast two modes of being:
*   **Goal-Oriented (Source of *Dukkha*):** Wanting what you don't have (the championship, the toy, Samadhi, enlightenment), leading to a divided and dissatisfied mind.
*   **Process-Oriented (Source of Satisfaction):** Finding joy and wholeness in the present activity (playing the game, playing with toys, gladdening the mind, enjoying the show), which naturally yields the desired qualities like Metta or Samadhi as a byproduct, not a target.
