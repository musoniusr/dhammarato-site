### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And so, um, basically, Alex, first off, congratulations for calling. That was a wise move. Um, and also congratulations for reaching a place so that you can get some momentum going and feeling like that you're on top of the world. Oh yeah, yeah, that's exactly what we're practicing here, is getting on top of the world. But as you've already heard me talk about it, in the sense that we need to get on top of the world, our own world, in seclusion, to get our own mind together. Yeah. And when we get our own mind together, then we can go out into the world and see if we can keep that mind together while we're dealing with the ups and downs of other people's ups and downs.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's what I— that's what I did. Okay, I got my data, right?

**Speaker A:** And, uh, you can congratulate yourself for figuring out quickly that you couldn't handle it. Yeah, and there's no reason for you to continue to, uh, to do that. I mean, there's so many examples. Sticking your hand in the fire is no cure for having stuck your hand in the fire before.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or as Mitch McConnell says, there's no education in the second kick of a mule.

**Speaker B:** I don't know if I know that one.

**Speaker A:** Well, he's actually wrong. But I have seen, not only in real life years and years ago, but recently I have seen that on videos. And generally the dog needs to get kicked twice, generally because the first time that the mule kicked, the mule wasn't watching carefully enough. But when the dog keeps bothering him, the next kick is going to be well placed. And there goes that dog. And so that's the whole point, is— and I use it in the expression, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune— that you can see that stuff coming and learn to dodge it. But you have to be able to see it coming. And not dodge it in order to recognize the danger in it so that next time you can see that kick coming and you can stand out of the way. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that's what had happened, right? I was dodging left and right. I was like, oh, that's missed me. This missed me.

**Speaker A:** Look at that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, wow. Oh my God, this is great. And then all of a sudden it's like Oh, fuck.

**Speaker A:** Oh no. Yeah, that's right. Sometimes a knockout happens in the 15th round. You go 14 rounds and you've got it made, okay? And then that 15th round, and we've gotten tired or whatever, and then— well.

**Speaker B:** What'S interesting is I talked to Dan this morning and he was like, brother, you just got knocked out. You did great, you did great. You dodged this one and that one and this one and that one. You just got knocked out though. You're on the ground and I'm saying, brother, come on, let's go out of the ring now. And you're like, wait, no, Dan, come on, I want to give it one more shot. And your eye's bleeding. And I didn't understand it. I really didn't understand it. And I honestly From his perspective, what he said he was hearing is that I was trying to bargain. I was trying to find a way in which it would be wise for me to continue with this girl. And I was, I was, right? Okay, because this time is different. This time is different.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know, I know. And I must speak of about the Wisdom of Nan, that in fact this point that we're making now about the bargaining or the figuring it out or whatever is actually part of Elizabeth Kübler-Ross's— it's actually this sequence is done in a book she calls On Death and Dying. It's about hospice. When people figure out that they're going to die, what do they do between the time that they recognize they've been told or they've been diagnosed or whatever and told they're dead? What happens? Okay, there's a sequence of events that happen, and some people never get to the full issue. And the full issue would be complete acceptance. That I'm dying and I'm dead. Yeah, okay. But the first thing that happens is we get all pissed off. We don't believe it. We want a second opinion. We start negotiating with the doctor. Well, what if I go to the gym? Or why don't you take both the pancreas and the kidneys and the livers out? Maybe I'll survive that too, you know. So, but we're we get into without recognizing that some things are better left dying and dead. Because everything dies anyway. Every person dies. Every relationship therefore dies. Every relationship dies. There comes a time when a son is no longer a son because Mama's dead, or he is. So when we recognize that that cycle is real, that it does happen, and that it's the cycle of Samsara, and in the sense of that cycle, it's like the winning and losing. When we win, we're on top, and then when we lose, we're on the bottom. Then when we win We okay. But what happens with the way that you had gotten yourself into is you were feeling like you were losing a lot, and then you started Anapanasati and you started winning a lot. And then you thought that, well, if I can win this one, I can win everything. And the answer to that is no. But the skills that you developed in getting over one thing will be the same skills that need to develop so that you can get over the next cycle. The next death. Yeah. And from what you told me about this relationship, it doesn't meet— or let us say, the, the people, the person involved with it doesn't meet your moral standards. You mentioned that. Okay, we can go into details, but I thought that we'd just leave it at that because you know what I'm talking about. Um, dating a married man, for instance, is not up to your moral standards.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, especially if you're the married man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Who winds up in the hot water and losing a good relationship because you were piddling around with one that didn't exist. Okay, so you can see that from both sides, and you can also recognize that that you're probably not going to win this one, that in fact, if she is doing those kinds of things, she's going to continue to do those kinds of things. And then not only that, but she's going to come back and brag to you about it as a way of keeping dominance. And so you calling— I don't think.

**Speaker B:** That'S what she was doing. Well, at least it didn't— I couldn't tell if it was. I couldn't tell. The attitude and spirit with which she was sharing this information didn't seem to come from being superior or trying to assert her dominance over me.

**Speaker A:** Well, it may have been subtle. Okay, and it may have been, uh, that, uh, it was clearly obvious and you were still missing it. Okay, that as you said that she was drinking, so I assumed that meant that you were drinking too. All right, Eric Byrne. Eric Byrne has two games that are played with alcohol. I wouldn't call the people who were doing it alcoholics directly because there's other factors with that, but there's two games that players draw, or drinkers play. One of them is drunk and proud, and the other one is lush. And both men play— both men and women play both parts. Okay, and not only that, but the lust, let us say, is the one who is crying in their beer. In fact, you can look at it in the sense of how the beer mug is held determines which game that they're playing. If it's down and they're looking into it, that's the lust. If they're holding it up above their head, that's the drunken proud. And more than likely, if she had not been drunk, but it's also possible sober, that she would play that game with you. The drunken proud of, look what I've been doing.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's interesting you say that because a couple weeks ago she had told me that she went out with a 42-year-old, but not that he was married. So it wasn't until last night actually that she told me he was married, and she said she didn't tell me because she thought that it would be too much for me to hear.

**Speaker A:** So she thought it would be too much to deal with, and you're ratting it out right now that it was too much for you to deal with.

**Speaker B:** So maybe it was a drunk and proud kind of— right.

**Speaker A:** So, um, that drunk and proud, uh, is an item, uh, that when we recognize these games that we play when we are drunk should be enough for us to recognize that it's probably not a wise idea to get drunk. Yeah, yeah, that there's a whole lot of laws and rules and regulations against it. It's also, um, uh, bad for our health. And one item that's in this, an issue with me, is that I don't like the taste. I don't like the taste of beer. I don't like the taste of wine. Why do people drink that stuff? It doesn't even taste good. But if you go for, let us say, a bar mix drink, the reason that the bartender mixes the drink the way that they do is to make it palatable so that you can stand the alcohol that's in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure. It's the biggest joke.

**Speaker A:** On that particular note, looking at it from that position, people who are in war, want to drink to get away from the war. And the time when they're most likely to get really super drunk is right before the battle. They know they're going to lose.

**Speaker B:** Oh man.

**Speaker A:** Down deep inside they know that they're going to lose it. And so that was what was happening with, uh, the Russian army now is on a solid drunk this week.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's interesting you're saying all this because it's been very difficult to.

**Speaker A:** Know.

**Speaker B:** Because we can only trust our direct experience, right? But it's been very difficult to know for sure whether or not she is being honest with herself when she says that she is not addicted to alcohol, right? That there's no addiction there, because what.

**Speaker A:** She'Ll say is that she's either Anagami— addiction doesn't exist— or every human being is addicted. Those are the two possibilities. Okay. Oh, for sure.

**Speaker B:** And there's a spectrum within all that, right? Um, but she had expressed many times that she's just kind of doing things in moderation, and she's learning to drink less and not drink as much. And I feel like these past 2 months of not being in contact with her have allowed me to see all the ways in which I projected my own fear and insecurity on her and making it about the alcohol when really it was just about me.. And so I could see, hey, I respect you. I have a deeper respect for you. Like, she loves bartending. I used to think she just likes bartending so she can be around the alcohol. Well, maybe she does, but the words that are coming out of her mouth is that she just enjoys talking with people, being with the people. She's good at it. We all like to do things we're good at. We all like to experience that success and winning, right?

**Speaker A:** I was about to mention that before you said it, and that is when you said, oh, she likes to be around the alcohol. I was about to say that actually it's more likely that she likes to be around the people who are drinking alcohol. Yeah. And here you come right out with it, that yes, that's the case. Yeah. Um, a good bartender will do two things. One, he'll become a psychologist, and two, he'll quit his job.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, man, I mean, she's going in deep. She's thinking of quitting her recruiting job that she has that pays her a salary and just working at another bar because she just would rather do that. Um, but anyway, we don't need to get all into the weeds of that. What I, what I was going to tell you though is last night we hung out, and it has always been pretty clear that she's more vulnerable and intimate when she's drinking. And what that brought up to me, that made me think of what you said about how people will drink before they're about to lose the battle, before they know they're going to lose the battle. And I think this losing battle for her is probably intimacy with me. It's like, hey, This will make it easier kind of thing. But it's— you said maybe it's best to just let things die, to let the relationship die, right? What does that actually look like?

**Speaker A:** Um, first off, how long have you been together? Probably about 2 years, huh?

**Speaker B:** We were on and off for like 9. Foundation was terrible, Dhammarato. We started off as friends, and I basically told her that I was unsure about her in the very beginning. And then little do we know, a year later, she's unsure about me. So in a very weird sense, I feel as though I kind of created this for myself in a way, or at least created, conditioned the relationship to end the way it did.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, we have as humans two competing instinctual systems. One of them is more natural and primitive and the other one is normal because of culture that is built up in the past 10,000 years. So let's talk about it pre-10,000 years ago when we were hunters and gatherers, as opposed to what society has imposed upon us. If you can get those two distinctions, you'll see that progress that happens within each one of us. Okay. In 10,000 years ago relationships between a man and a woman, the man in the— uh, back then it was mostly tribal, so that the child that was born belonged to the tribe more so than the father. But when the kid was old enough, the dad was proud of him to take him hunting. That in fact, that was the rite of passage. Is to take the kid hunting, because if the kid is able to do the hunting with the tribe, with the men in the tribe, then he's the man. If he's too little to go hunting, then he belongs with mommies and children. Now the point of it is, is that in primitive times, how old was a young boy or a man, a young man when he first starts going hunting? Is it the age of 25?

**Speaker B:** I don't think so.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't think so. Why is that? Because 25, uh, is almost over the hill, right? But if you look at athletes, in fact, it looks like that, um, an example would be the 13-year-old girl who is a gymnast, right? Okay. But we can go back earlier than that because we recognize that kids are put to work in the fields at the age of about 6. In fact, the age of 6 is why we start school, is because the kid is old enough then to be ordered around, etc., like that, or he's smart enough to do things on his own. Okay, now that's an important point. If a 6-year-old is capable of taking care of himself, then he doesn't need daddy anymore. And so in the really, really primitive times, a relationship would last about 6 or 7 years and that was it. There was no reason to have a marriage or relationship after that. No. What happened was society came in and with society, the Anagami, the understanding of ownership of land, ownership of property, ownership of kinfolks, and Daddy owns his daughter. That in fact, in India, the whole idea of the dowry is the father comes by and says, you owe me all of this equipment because I raised this girl for you. Okay? And so dowries and purchase and all of that kind of came in. And so on the other side of it all, Well, if you're going to sell this girl to me, she's mine permanently. She can't sneak back home. She's mine forever. Another one is, is that, oh, I don't want to catch any cooties from her, and she better not already be pregnant. Okay, so that's where the old idea about virgins came in. And now, uh, the ones who are religious pick that up and start running with it. Okay, and so now we come up with institutions like marriage And everyone in our society looks at marriage as, oh, it only works if it lasts and lasts and lasts and lasts. And that's not even normal. It's not natural, a normal working marriage. Now, the next thing is, is that over time, children wind up in a very primitive society at age 6, are quite capable. But in a complicated society, they need some complication, and that complication takes years. That at one time, the age of reason or the age of adulthood was 12 years old. This is the time of the Bar Mitzvah, about 2,000 years ago. Then it became like a high school, military. In fact, they want the kids at best at about 16 to 18 because they're trainable. A 22-year-old is going to be slower in following orders. You can't intimidate a 22-year-old the way you can an 18-year-old. You cannot intimidate a 35-year-old nearly as well as you can an 18-year-old. And a 75-year-old man is going to laugh at you. Okay, you want me to do how many push-ups? Okay, so that's the thing, is that over the period of time, the age of reason or the age of adulthood has changed and has always been political in the sense of, if I can get drafted at the age of 18, why can't I drink and why can't I vote at the age of 18? Well, an 18-year-old in our society is not mature. That's why they wanted to raise the gun age, because 18-year-olds can buy guns, and now we have all of this weaponry with all of these school shootings. School shootings— why are they at the schools? Because it's the kids who are doing the shooting. And so raising the age to 21 is a way of doing it, but I think they ought to raise the age to about 35, when people are fully adults. Before they can get a gun. I would put the right to— that's a good idea.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, so, uh, what we're looking at now is that you were caught in that area of the bind of recognizing when the relationship is over naturally, but you're supposed to stay in the relationship because society tells you to. So look at that for yourself, to recognize, do you— which— what are you crying over? The breaking of the rule of how it's important to keep relationships? Or are you crying over the fact that a really good relationship is ending prematurely? Or is the relationship ending at the right time But it's against the rules to do it that way.

**Speaker B:** I think it's something in the middle.

**Speaker A:** Okay, got elements of both of them, huh? You got both legs stuck in the bananas.

**Speaker B:** Actually, I wouldn't— I mean, there might be some cultural, you know, things in there because, I mean, I guess to some degree that's kind of inescapable, right? Because that's kind of what I'm part of.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Atheist, in fact, in the West, when we talk about how Christianity has so much stuff in the culture, the atheist says, well, I'm not a Christian, they don't affect me. Hey, man, Christianity is the water we fish, swim in. And we don't even know how deep into that culture those mores, traditions, expectations, etc.

**Speaker B:** Go to, even if you don't go to church.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, um, actually, the ones who don't go to church are actually more affected by it than those who do, because those who continue to go to church get permission somehow to get away with it. In other words, the rules that God set down to his children means that the children now are the ones who dispense the rules. And so they're going to dispense them around to the other people without following them themselves. This is why there's so many opportunities for preachers who will scream from the pulpit about what people are supposed to be doing, and within a year they're caught doing those things themselves. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in that same regard, you could say the same thing about people that go to church. They're just as worse off as the ones that don't.

**Speaker A:** Now, well, here's one of the things then that's interesting. We know that, um, let us say it this way, because the evidence is this way, the research has been done this way, count by county, county by county. And so the counties are then kind of listed as red or blue, and basically it's not really the red or blue, is what they're measuring is two things. One is they're measuring how much population of this county is religious and how much. And then the other thing that you're taking from this county is the public records from the police and, um, uh, county services and all of that kind of stuff, and putting that data together. And this is what they have found. Is that places that have very, very low church attendance have very much better society in the sense that it's the ones who go to church are the ones who drink, they fight, they get into bar scenes, they have automobile accidents, they have domestic violence, they do drugs, all of this kind of stuff. And then they go hop into the church and get forgiveness. And then they're back out on the street again. To where when someone's an atheist and gives up that Christian stuff, they begin to recognize, oh, I am responsible for myself. Yeah, I have to do it myself. I cannot go beating up my family, because if I beat up my family, the cops are going to come and deal with me, and I can't go pray that away. Okay. And so the society's rules that Christianity sets down Actually, then everybody is subject to that. It's built into our legal systems. Then in fact, that's what legislation is, is legislation is legislating morality. What else can it do? They say you can't legislate morality. What are you going to.

**Speaker B:** Legislate? Yeah, pretty dependent on that, huh?

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, exactly. Especially penal codes. Penal is the word where the word prison comes out of. Penal, punishment. Okay, rather than what we teach in Buddhism is rehabilitation. Not punishment.

**Speaker B:** For sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Is to rehabilitate. Now, uh, there's a difference between, let us say, in Thailand, between the government and the wat. If someone goes into the wat, he's going there to be rehabilitated. If he goes in jail, he's going there to get punished. Okay, so that's the difference. In Christianity, though, they go to the church to get permission. They go to get forgiveness. And so they get neither the punishment nor the rehabilitation. Yeah. So with that, the way that we can take this information is to recognize that you do have this duality within you. The very, very primitive stuff, our real genes, are saying that the relationship is finished, it's over. The girl doesn't do the kinds of things that I would want to have someone around to do, that in fact, uh, she's not Very mature. Okay, so with this understanding, you can easier let go of the relationship instead of keeping the idea of, oh, I want a relationship, or I should have, or I deserve a relationship, which is actually much more of the society kind of thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. And actually, one thing I wanted to share is that I, these past couple months, I have gone out on dates and stuff and like just had fun and meet women. But I gotta be honest with you, it's gotten to a point where I just, I have no interest. I have no interest in other women except for the one I was in a previous relationship with. But even now I'm seeing that I can't have that. But I guess what I'm saying is, since completing this time together again, I do not feel a propulsion to jump on a dating app and meet women again. I have zero interest in it.

**Speaker A:** Whatsoever. Well, actually, uh, that's a very natural occurrence. Yeah. And, um, what we're looking at is, is that in fact when one becomes interested in the Dhamma— yeah— we start looking at how the, uh, things fit in according to the Dhamma, and we recognize then that many of the things that I have been doing don't cause the satisfaction that I was looking for, that it causes dukkha instead, that it's a mixed bag at best. Mixed bag. Recognize that things are really mixed bag in there. That's when we begin to then weigh the advantages to the disadvantages. Okay. A phrase that's used in business is a cost-benefit analysis. Okay, and so this is what we begin to do. This is wisdom, by the way, is to do that cost-benefit analysis, to look at the gratification that I was seeking. Yeah, yeah, doesn't come purely by itself. It comes in a package called trouble.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Yep. And when we see that, we're much more careful about who we choose to associate with. That in fact, that's what the Sangha is all about, is when we are looking for good people to associate with and we find each other. A lot of people who start to practice meditation and whatnot, they begin to feel alone. Because no one in their community is interested in the realities of life. Everybody around is more interested in the social stuff of life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so finding people who are worthy of your association. Yeah. Okay, this is, by the way, what the word Arahant meant. The word Arahant does not mean some highfalutin Buddhist kind of term that so many of them have with this, this, this, this, this, and this in order to qualify. The actual word Arahant means to be worthy, worthy of respect, worthy of gifts, worthy of spending my time with. Yeah, okay. And so it's for you I'm worthy of your time, and for me, you're worthy of my time, right? So be sure that the people that you associate with are worthy of your time. Yeah. And getting drunk and listening to either drunk and proud or poor me stories is not really a good time, good way to spend your time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't, I, I don't really drink much ever, honestly. I was just doing it because we were having a good time and, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, well, it is considered celebration, you know, that's part of, um, uh, and guess what, that comes from Christianity, the celebration of the wine and, uh, Eucharist and, uh, all kind of, uh, the Last Supper and drinking the wine and all of that kind of stuff, uh, makes that now alcohol is special. The next thing that makes it special is we tell children, oh, you can't have it, you're not old enough, which makes the kid want it more.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, if You give a 12-year-old or a 10-year-old a taste of beer and say, you probably won't like this. And the kid says, yeah, I don't like this. And he'll be better off. But if you tell that same 8 or 10 or 12-year-old, oh, you can't have beer, now he wants it. Yeah. And he'll drink it no matter how bad it tastes. So This is the way that our psychology, or the way that society works, puts us in a really, really bad state. The society is not there for the welfare and the benefit of any particular person. Yeah. And therefore, everybody in this society winds up suffering from it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker A:** And it looks like that those who are heirs to a fortune are the ones who suffer the.

**Speaker B:** Most. Who, who are what to the fortune?

**Speaker A:** Heirs to a fortune. Daddy's got a lot of money. Daddy's the big moneybags, which means Daddy's the biggest asshole in town, and he's an asshole to his kids. And he holds that big moneybag up and says, you do what I say or you're not going to get any of this. And so, um, they want the kids and wind up being a Donald Trump. I heard about this from my, um, high school Latin teacher when she was teaching ancient Latin and, uh, Roman culture. She pointed out that a father or a mother who wants power winds up destroying their children. But it's also possible for the grandfather or the grandmother to see how the damage they did to their own kids, and then their grandkids, they begin to treat really well. And so it is better then in a dynasty to skip a generation. Because the big tough dude, the emperor, is going to have an asshole for a son, but he's probably going to have a pretty good grandson. Yeah. All right, so, um, there's not much reason to talk about this other than to recognize how much our society has screwed us up. Oh, for sure. And that we can in fact begin to recognize the difference between what you're supposed to do or what rules you're supposed to follow versus how you actually feel about this girl. And the way that you're feeling about the girl is, is that you really don't want that much of her. That's what I've gotten from you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, I, I like that you brought that up because I think that's kind of You know, it'd be great if I could have some clarity around that because I think that's probably why I keep going back because there's not like a real solid clarity. But what I can tell you is when her and I are together, there is kind of just like this. It just seems, it seems at least unless I don't know what love is, I think it's probably a mix of attachment and authentic love that there is really just a deep care for her, a real just love for her, and a genuine interest in her benefits.

**Speaker A:** And that's good, that's positive. I congratulate you on that. But instead of nozzling it down like a strong spray, like for a cleaning, what we want to do is open that valve and spread it all over. In other words, yeah, well, there's many ways to say it. One is love the one you're with. Yeah, as opposed to wanting someone else over there. Go ahead and bring that up, that in fact another way that we can talk about it, this part of the society, is the whole idea of soulmate. The Christians go around saying there's some place out there is a girl for you? And the guys go around looking at every girl, putting up against the model that he's got in his head.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker A:** That one of the things that I learned, it was actually quite beneficial to me when I was 14 playing the piano. I got a recital piece. In fact, the teacher may have had this wisdom. She gave me a piece of music to learn to play. The name of it was "There's Lots of Good Fish in the Sea." The sea— there's lots of good fish in the sea. You know immediately what that means. It's sexualized, right? Stop thinking that someone is it. Yeah. And instead recognize that there are a lot of good fish in the sea. Let's go find someone that fits in with the way that I think and the way that I look. But in fact, that's one of the reasons why I knew that the only way I was ever going to find a woman is by going to Thailand, because Western women don't think.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** But that came from a different— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Can I ask you this? You know, she— I guess like the most difficult part about all this is she often has said to me, like in this past week as we've hung out, is that even though she can't commit, even though she has a fear of intimacy, even though she wants to explore with other people, she says that no one holds a candle to me. She said she'll go out with other guys and she won't want to do anything with them, and she'll just basically go home and cry and think about me. She hasn't had sex with anybody. Because she doesn't feel right doing that. Like, she only wants to be that way with me. And she thinks that eventually, when she's all kind of— she's gotten her experience and have seen clearly that there isn't greener grass on the other side, and she sees how good of a partner I am, that she'll eventually come back and, you know, whatever, want to be with me. And that's hard to hear. That's hard to hear because— well, it's great to hear, but it's hard to hear because it's like, well, but we're not together right now. But I get it, I get it. It's just, it's confusing for me because I am, I'd say, more or less available And yeah, I don't know. It's just, that's.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** I guess my question for you would be, why do I keep going back to her? What is it that I haven't seen that keeps me going around in this.

**Speaker A:** Dance? Um, basically because you have put so many thought moments into thinking about her that you've ground a pathway in the mind, a neurological pathway that leads directly to thoughts of her. And the way that you're going to interrupt that is recognizing that every time you begin to have a thought of her, you can say, I can change that, and I can come out of what I don't have and start looking at what I do have, like this moment, this breath. This is all we need. We're okay right now. Okay, that's the thing we need to start doing, is the Anapanasati, to remember to think about the things that you have rather than remembering to think about the things you don't have. That's number one. Number two, we have already talked about Sadie Hawkins, have we not? Do you remember Sadie Hawkins? Remind me. Well, it's also the 29th of February, girls' night out. It's girls' opportunity to dance with the boys. In fact, one of the students says, oh, they had a Sadie Hawkins dance. When he was in high school. But the reality is, is that the whole idea of Sadie Hawkins is for guys to start taking a more feminine role and sit back and relax and wait and let the women do all the work. Reverse these roles, because these roles are not natural. They're not in nature. They're not built into our genes. It's that that's the way that things are supposed to be done in our society. The boys are supposed to go after the girls. The girls are supposed to play koi or hard to get. Okay, that's, by the way, back into the Christian stuff. I mean, this stuff has been around for so long and all of this cultural stuff. So what we can do is interrupt that game. And sit back and wait for her. But not wait for her, but just go live your life. Yeah. And, and take your life and take your mind off of her and let her have all of the mental machinations about the relationship.

**Speaker B:** So, you know, I told you about these past 2 months, right? That's basically essentially what I did. I just— any thought I ever had about her, I just would rest let it go.

**Speaker A:** That's why I congratulated you for that.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and it was great. And then she came.

**Speaker A:** Back.

**Speaker B:** So my question is, like, have I just not done that enough, essentially, then? Just haven't let go of those mind moments enough such that when she came back, I was pulled back into familiar patterns and so on and so on?

**Speaker A:** Yes, it may just be, but congratulate yourself for seeing that. Yeah, okay, look at the bright side of life rather than fussing at yourself. Oh, you got stuck in it again. Recognize, oh wow, I'm getting stuck at this stuff again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, and then never mind, start again. Okay, then in fact she pulled you in, you both got drunk Now she's got a drunken proud going, leaving you with nothing.

**Speaker B:** But— I did not get drunk.

**Speaker A:** No, but she did. That's what you said. Yes. And then that's when she pulled out that she was, uh, playing around with married men, which is a very dangerous thing to do. Yeah, more dangerous for him than for her because she's got less to lose. Yeah, but she ought to have the moral respect for this guy to say no.

**Speaker B:** Well, she did, and then they went out anyway. Two.

**Speaker A:** Weeks. Okay, so maybe she needs to see a disaster. Yeah, for her to get the point that that's not appropriate behavior. But it was also not appropriate behavior to advertise that she had done that.

**Speaker B:** To you. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, I mean, she had— I remember she had said after that, she was like, she was saying things like, see, it's about personality to me. Like, he, he acted like he was young, like he was 20, and I, and I like that. So who knows, like, if I came across a 70-year-old and they had a similar personality I might kiss them. She was saying things like this, and I was like, wow. So, yeah, I think what I've done, Dhammarato, is basically anytime I notice a potential incompatibility, for instance, that thing that she said, right? I have a tendency to see it as like, whoa, I didn't like that. But then I use that as practice, like, oh, just let go, just rest. That's fine.

**Speaker A:** That's right. That's right. You're learning. Keep going. That's it.

**Speaker B:** But is it also the case, though, that some things, like, I think what you're pointing to here is that, like, there's a maturity difference, or like you said, she shouldn't have been advertising that. Is it also the case that no matter how much I can accept things as they are, no matter how much we can rest from our own opinions and dislike of points of view of what we have towards someone, it doesn't mean necessarily that that's the end-all be-all, that, uh, essentially sometimes it's just not a good thing. Maybe it's just not a good thing to be with someone that does things like that or says things like that.

**Speaker A:** Or, you know, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Is, is.

**Speaker A:** That— my mother knew that also. And warned me about it, but she was only looking at it in the sense of education. I have a high school dropout and someone with a master's degree she would see is not a good match. Okay, but we can refine that to understand it in the sense of wisdom rather than education. The wisdom of life. And you're gaining a lot of that with your practice and associating with a Sangha and other things like this, to where she has no spiritual guide at all, she's got no spiritual practice, or she's got no self-improvement things going on, that she's still out what you would say experiment.

**Speaker B:** She is a therapist, but she sees him once a month. So, but it's good she is in.

**Speaker A:** Therapy. Once a month. Yeah, good luck with that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's because it's so expensive, that's why she hasn't done it more.

**Speaker A:** But right, I understand. And, and psychiatrists and psychologists are really good with that. That means it. I mean, that's once a month, got a client for the next 30 years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, what's good is he is really familiar with Buddhism and stuff, and he's been practicing it for years as well. It's been a big part of his practice, so I think that's good. But I think you're right. I think you're absolutely right that there is a big mature A big maturity difference, a big gap in our understanding of life and of ourselves, which, yeah, I guess that is bound to cause complications, isn't.

**Speaker A:** It?

**Speaker B:** I just wish, Dhammarato, I could just see plainly and clearly like, oh, I'm not going to get into that anymore. I'm good. That would be great. I just haven't seen it yet, and.

**Speaker A:** I feel like I'm trying to convince myself. I would rather you see the fact that everything is in a cycle. Seeing the cycle is what's going to help us get out of the cycle. So you got to keep seeing those cycles over and over and over again. Begin to see that stuff. Up, down, up, down, back, forth, in, out. You know the whole show. Everything.

**Speaker B:** Oh, and hey, that's another thing, right? I have never experienced a more, like, amazing connection during sex with another person. And she actually said the same thing to me, like, no more greater. Like, she's very We just completely melt into each other, and that's a hard thing to let go of too.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know. Great sex is part of the promise of our society. If you buy enough makeup and buy enough expensive clothes and do, you know, take her to the nicest restaurant, then the sex will be great. When you recognize that ejaculation is just ejaculation and that you feel better after you do it rather than while you're in it, that they call it a sex drive because it drives us around. You're not in control, your gonads are. And there's so much is talking about that. Which head are you thinking with, you know? So that's the whole idea, is to thinking that great sex means the relationship is great. It's not true at all. Generally, great sex happens when we haven't had it for a long time And so they won't recognize it as ordinary. But if you have great sex every day, what's the.

**Speaker B:** Great— right? Well, what if it is not driven purely by just trying to ejaculate? That it's really— there's like some kind of— there's like a real— like, I don't— like, I guess I experience being when I'm in sex, engaging in sex with her, last couple times we've had sex, it's like I don't see her as separate or like as an other. It's almost like as an extension of myself.

**Speaker A:** And like, we— like, well, they talk about it like that, as a union, okay? Yeah. And that you are together there in the same, uh, mental state of loving, okay? Being in love and in a loving relationship is what gives the best part of the feeling. And then we add that to the sex.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes. All right. So recognizing that you can have that experience with many, many different kinds of people, you can relate to many kinds of people. There is a lot of good fish in the sea. And not all of them are trout. Okay, okay. So, um, yes, sex with her was good. That doesn't mean anything, okay, that in fact, uh, there's another side of it, and that is that the very, very best sex is after an argument. Have you ever heard of that one? Right. Why? Because they have been unhappy and dissatisfied, and now they resolved it in their longing, and now they come together. Okay. Rather than just having ordinary sex, now they've come together and having sex. So that Having sex after a big argument is something that is well known in our culture too, because sex is really good. But it's good not because of the sex, it's good because of the union that they have after the argument.

**Speaker B:** Okay. I would say that I think my angle in this is that I experienced the most depth, vulnerability with her and from her during sex, not outside of it. So in conversation, it's not— it's rarely ever there. It's, it's usually in sex.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** So that's probably why there's an issue.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay. Knowing now that that's an experience, but that in general that there are other experiences to have, that you in fact can go for that intimacy with your relationship with people rather than sexual.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. What I've wanted to have that with her, and she, she's not there.

**Speaker A:** Right? Right, so she's still immature in that regard, um, of not recognizing that the real relationship is not in the bed. A real marriage is a connection between two people where they, uh, they speak the same language so well together they don't even have to talk. That in fact, Tam and I will look at each other in a particular way, both of us will just burst out laughing. We do not have to have the word between it. We know what's going on, okay? That's, that's the connection, all right? But it gets started with sexuality, but in the case that you've got, it's just remaining there that you don't really have that really deep connection with her.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but you can't, except for when she typically, after a night of drinking, she'll come to me and she's more vulnerable and more intimate and sharing herself and crying. And then I hold her and— right.

**Speaker A:** That'S the lush, that's the life. And a lot of people need to get into that lush state with the alcohol in order to have that intimacy. It is an invitation. So the alcohol is an invitation into intimacy. But you're now recognizing, I think, that alcohol is unnecessary to have intimacy.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, no, I— alcohol is one of the last things on my list when I consider what intimacy is or where it's derived from.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you'd be surprised that most intimacy in the West is fueled by alcohol.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, man, it's, it's nuts. I know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's, it's pretty. And so are, by the way, bar fights. Almost all bar fights are fueled by alcohol. Yeah, yeah. Well, Alex, I think we've come to a good place that we know what's going on. I've given you a lot to think about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was really nice just to get to talk to you. Just, you know, I appreciate you and look up to you a lot. And I see you as a father figure. So it was nice to just kind of just let my emotions melt into our conversation. I'm feeling it, man. I got the sad sometimes, but it's okay. It's okay.

**Speaker A:** You can handle it. There's a lot of good fish in the sea out there. You keep your eyes open, know what's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't want to be with anyone right now.

**Speaker A:** That's— I don't want to go out.

**Speaker B:** I don't want to. I don't care. The juice is not worth the squeeze.

**Speaker A:** The lots of good fish in the sea mentality is a good reason to not have to go fishing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, good.

**Speaker A:** When you think that it's really, really special and there's not enough fish out there, I gotta go get mine. But when you ask this guy, there's a lot of good fishing to see. That's a good reason to not go.

**Speaker B:** Fishing. Yeah, I don't have to worry about dinner, it's taken care.

**Speaker A:** Of. All right, Alex, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Alrighty, bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend named Alex (Speaker B), centers on using Buddhist wisdom to navigate the end of a romantic relationship and the accompanying emotional turmoil. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Teaching: Getting "On Top of the World"**
The talk begins by congratulating Alex on his meditation practice (Anapanasati), which helped him gain mental clarity and momentum ("on top of the world"). The primary goal is to first stabilize the mind in seclusion, then learn to maintain that stability amidst life's "ups and downs."

### **Main Subject: Letting Go of a Problematic Relationship**
Alex discusses his painful, on-again-off-again relationship with a woman. Key issues include:
*   **Broken Trust & Moral Misalignment:** She revealed she went on dates with a married man, which conflicts with Alex's moral standards.
*   **Alcohol & Vulnerability:** Her intimacy and vulnerability primarily surface when drinking, which Dhammarato frames as playing psychological "games" like "Drunk and Proud" or "Lush."
*   **Mixed Signals:** She claims Alex is her best connection and might return to him after "exploring," leaving him in a state of confusion and hope.

### **Dhammarato's Guidance and Key Insights**

1.  **The Wisdom of Knowing When to Leave:** Dhammarato strongly advises that some things are "better left dying and dead." He uses analogies:
    *   **The Mule Kick:** You don't need a second kick from a mule (or to repeat a painful experience) to learn. The skill is in seeing the "kick" coming and stepping aside.
    *   **The 15th-Round Knockout:** You can dodge blows for a long time, but fatigue can lead to a final knockout. Recognizing when you're "on the ground" and need to leave the ring is crucial.
    *   **Stages of Grief:** He references Elizabeth Kübler-Ross's stages (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance), noting Alex is in the "bargaining" phase—trying to rationalize staying.

2.  **Societal vs. Natural Cycles:** Dhammarato explains that human instincts and societal rules are often in conflict.
    *   **Natural Cycle:** Primarily, relationships served to raise children to self-sufficiency (around age 6-7), after which they naturally ended.
    *   **Societal Imposition:** Modern institutions like lifelong marriage are cultural constructs that can create guilt and confusion when a relationship ends naturally.
    *   **The Advice:** Alex should examine whether his pain comes from the natural end of a bond or from breaking internalized societal "rules."

3.  **Practical Dhamma Tools:**
    *   **Cost-Benefit Analysis (Wisdom):** Weigh the gratification (good sex, moments of connection) against the accompanying "package called trouble" (dishonesty, moral conflict, pain).
    *   **Interrupting Mental Patterns:** The obsessive thoughts about her are a worn neural pathway. The antidote is to consciously redirect attention to the present moment and the breath (*Anapanasati*) whenever those thoughts arise.
    *   **Associating with the Worthy (Sangha):** Seek out people worthy of your time and respect (the true meaning of *Arahant*). A partner who engages in harmful behavior is not a beneficial association.

4.  **Reframing Perspectives:**
    *   **"Lots of Good Fish in the Sea":** This isn't just a prompt to date more, but a wisdom that relieves the pressure and clinging inherent in the "soulmate" myth. If there are many good possibilities, you can relax and focus on your own life.
    *   **Reversing Roles:** Don't play the societal game of chasing. "Sit back and wait... let her have all of the mental machinations." Live your life and let go of the need to control the outcome.
    *   **Sex vs. Intimacy:** Great sex is often mistaken for a great relationship. True intimacy is a deep, non-verbal connection and shared understanding that exists outside the bedroom—something Alex acknowledges is lacking with her.

### **Conclusion**
Alex concludes that while he feels deep care for her, there is a significant maturity gap and incompatibility in their life paths and values. Dhammarato's final advice is to **see the cyclical nature of suffering (Samsara)**—the ups and downs, the coming and going—and to keep practicing to understand this cycle fully. The talk ends with Alex affirming he currently has no interest in dating, and Dhammarato reframes the "lots of fish" idea as a reason to feel at ease, not to go searching.

**In essence, the talk is a compassionate yet firm guide on using mindfulness and wisdom to see a painful situation clearly, break free from clinging and societal conditioning, and prioritize one's own spiritual development and peace of mind.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A, Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and illustrative stories, primarily drawn from common experience, folklore, and Buddhist thought, to counsel Speaker B (Alex) about his tumultuous relationship and personal growth.

Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **"Getting on top of the world" / "Getting your own mind together"**
    *   **Usage:** Used early on to frame the goal of meditation (Anapanasati). It means achieving internal stability and clarity in seclusion, which then allows you to navigate the external world ("the ups and downs of other people's ups and downs").

2.  **The Mule Kick (from Mitch McConnell)**
    *   **Story:** "There's no education in the second kick of a mule." The speaker refines it, saying sometimes a dog *does* get kicked twice—the first time is a warning, the second is well-aimed. The point is to learn from the first painful experience (the "kick") to see danger coming and avoid it next time.
    *   **Application:** Alex should learn from the pain of this relationship to see the patterns and "dodge" similar hurtful situations in the future.

3.  **The 15th Round Knockout**
    *   **Metaphor:** Comparing the relationship struggle to a long boxing match. You can dodge and succeed for many rounds (14), but exhaustion can lead to a knockout in the final round (15).
    *   **Application:** Alex did well to avoid problems for a while, but eventually got overwhelmed ("knocked out"). The advice is to recognize when you're beaten and leave the ring.

4.  **The Stages of Dying (Elizabeth Kübler-Ross)**
    *   **Story:** Referencing the stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance) from *On Death and Dying*.
    *   **Application:** Alex's attempt to "bargain" and find a way to make the relationship work is likened to the bargaining stage when facing death. Some things (like this relationship) are "better left dying and dead." Acceptance is the goal.

5.  **The Cycle of Samsara / Winning and Losing**
    *   **Metaphor:** Using the Buddhist concept of Samsara (the cycle of suffering and rebirth) to describe life's natural cycles of highs and lows, winning and losing.
    *   **Application:** Alex felt he was "losing," then started winning through meditation, and thought he could "win" this relationship too. The speaker says no—you can't win every cycle, but the skills you build help you endure the next "death" or downturn.

6.  **Games Alcoholics Play ("Drunk and Proud" and "Lush")**
    *   **Story:** References Eric Berne's *Games People Play*, describing two roles: "Drunk and Proud" (boastful, dominant) and "Lush" (sad, crying in their beer).
    *   **Application:** Analyzes the girlfriend's behavior when drinking. Her sharing about dating a married man is interpreted as a potential "Drunk and Proud" move—a way to assert dominance or test boundaries.

7.  **Drinking Before Battle**
    *   **Metaphor:** Soldiers drink heavily before a battle they deep down know they will lose.
    *   **Application:** Suggests the girlfriend might drink to facilitate intimacy because she subconsciously knows she can't handle true sober intimacy ("losing the battle"). It's a way to make a difficult connection easier.

8.  **"Lots of Good Fish in the Sea"**
    *   **Metaphor:** A common saying about romantic prospects, which the speaker recalls from a piano piece titled this way.
    *   **Application:** Counters the idea of a "soulmate." The abundance of potential partners is a reason **not** to desperately cling to one problematic one. It should bring peace, not pressure to "go fishing."

9.  **"The Juice is not worth the Squeeze"**
    *   **Metaphor:** (Used by Alex) The effort (the squeeze) required for the reward (the juice) in dating is currently disproportionate.
    *   **Application:** Expresses Alex's current disinterest in the dating market due to the emotional labor involved.

### **Supporting Analogies & Concepts**

*   **Sticking your hand in the fire:** Repeating a painful action is not a cure for the past pain.
*   **"The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune":** (From Shakespeare's *Hamlet*) Life's hardships. The skill is in seeing them coming and dodging.
*   **Neurological pathway / thought moments:** The mind creates deep ruts by thinking about the person repeatedly. The cure is to consciously redirect attention (e.g., to the breath).
*   **Sadie Hawkins Day / Reversing Roles:** Suggests breaking social scripts where men pursue. Instead, "sit back and relax and let the women do all the work," focusing on your own life.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis (Gratification vs. Trouble):** Wisdom is weighing the fleeting pleasure of a relationship against the package of trouble it brings.
*   **Worthy of Association (Arahant):** Redefines the Buddhist term "Arahant" simply as someone "worthy of your time." Advises Alex to associate only with those worthy of his.
*   **Society as Water / Christianity as Cultural Water:** We swim in cultural norms (like Christian-derived ideas about marriage and monogamy) without realizing it, and they shape our suffering.
*   **Heirs to a Fortune:** Those who stand to inherit great wealth often suffer the most from the controlling dynamics and expectations.
*   **Which head are you thinking with?:** The conflict between logical thought and sexual drive.
*   **Sex after an argument:** The best sex often comes from reconciliation and renewed union, not just the physical act, highlighting that great sex doesn't equal a great relationship.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose**
The metaphors serve to:
*   **Normalize Alex's experience** (cycles, knockout, stages of grief).
*   **Depersonalize the pain** by framing it as a universal pattern (mule kick, fire, Samsara).
*   **Provide vivid mental models** for understanding the girlfriend's behavior (alcohol games, pre-battle drinking).
*   **Challenge societal conditioning** (fish in the sea, reversed roles, cultural water).
*   **Point toward a wiser, more detached, and self-possessed way of living** (getting on top of your own world, cost-benefit analysis, being worthy of association).

The speaker uses these stories to gently guide Alex from a place of personal hurt and confusion toward a broader, more philosophical and resilient perspective.
