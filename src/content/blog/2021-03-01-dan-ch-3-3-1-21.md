### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So you were talking about tiredness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like to practice first thing in the morning, kind of set myself up for success for the day, so to speak. I find that— it sounds good. Yeah, I find that I just generally have more space internally if I do that. I'm someone who deals with chronic pain, and sitting in the morning actually really helps kind of adjust everything. And so that's what I like to do, but that tends to be kind of a sleepy time of day as well. So I practice eyes open. I've been following the advice that you've given on taking kind of intentionally deeper breaths and even holding at the top to energize the mind and flush out whatever toxins I think we were talking about last time. And that seems to be working. So I do.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** I am curious if you have any books or anything that you would recommend, specifically on, I guess, Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right down to chapter and verse, the book between your ears.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you got me. All right.

**Speaker A:** The sutta itself is Sutta Number 118 in the Majjhima Nikaya. That's where the sutta is, and it is fabergastedly dense. Every line is profound in that. Okay, that sounds exciting, and it needs to be read hundreds of times. Right down to the point of memorizing it because it's got that kind of value.

**Speaker B:** Is there a specific translation that you would recommend? We had talked about a lot of mistranslations in English, right?

**Speaker A:** I would go ahead and say that I actually encourage students to begin to take up Pali if you really care about what the Buddha taught. Then the way to go is to go deep enough so that you can begin to pull the words apart that even the dictionary online can't pull apart. And you begin to get alternate definitions and how the words are used and things like that. And you begin to see that many of the translations are wrong. They're wrong in several ways. One is they're wrong in translation. Another way that they're wrong is has to do with the grammar and word order, and that so changing the word order and things like that. But above all, the Pali is a— it appears actually to be more than one language, but they were very, very close together, so that in some suttas, the nominative and the dative cases are different, depending upon— not like in Greek, where the different kinds of Greeks were different times and things like that, and so changes were made like that, but this is mixed right in there into the but different suttas then will be just slightly different than the way that the Pali is used. However, the important point is, and this is the beautiful part, is that because of the regularity, if you have a whole lot of words that are going to be used in the dative case, then it's all going to have an -a�� sound at the end of it. The way that The way that we have in this, just tiny little vestiges left in the English would be the words whom as opposed to who, him as opposed to he, and them as opposed to they. And it's that M sound that you hear. An example of that is Buddha, Satta����a, Gacchami, Dhamma, Satta��a, Gacchami, Sangha, Suddhanam, Gacchami. So you hear that, that's why it can be sung, is because every word has so much similar— not the words themselves, but the tail end of every word comes back to that, uh, Nam sound. Buddha. Okay. And so that's what makes the Pali so poetic, is because of these regular things that keep repeating over and over and over again. And if you get into the rhythm of it, it's actually music. Yeah, okay. And, and the clear example of that that everyone has heard is that when this goes

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato Bhagavati.

**Speaker A:** And this music, it literally is the mantra itself, musical.

**Speaker B:** I love it.

**Speaker A:** That's missing in the translations, and so a lot of the way that the wording is done in the Suttas is to take advantage of that musical quality, especially with the verbs that are very, very commonly used. One is hoti, and the other one is bhav, which means— one hoti means already is, and bhav is development or becoming or process-oriented and is very much here now. And you'll hear these words bounce back and forth. It's actually really, really a lot of fun to get into the Pali. Yeah, but I, but I got there because I'd already had both Greek and Latin, so I had a kind of a leg up because those languages follow these same syntax, or all of these same rules. And because of that, that's why they are called this Indo-European languages, because the words have endings that, that show what case they're in. And we still have vestiges of that in English. Like, for instance, in Spanish they use del rey. The del means of, and we have the word of, like the Barber of Seville. Okay, so, but that's a different word, or a separate word for that. It's just a case, and, um, uh, it's not nominative. This is the gerund case.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And, and we also use the word possessive. The Bhavana of Seville means that Seville possesses, or he is the quality of, of Seville.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker A:** Like the people of note. So there— and all of those are different endings in the Pali. So as to keep track of who is who. And,

**Speaker B:** huh, okay, yeah, I'm definitely interested in that. I'll look into that.

**Speaker A:** And then we begin to understand that so many of the words that are just ordinary words in Nepali, by the time the translators get a hold of them, they've made them magical. An example of that is deva, deva manunatma. Deva manunasam, or in fact kings can be called devas, but also high-class ministers, the people at the top. And so you would have also used the word Brahman to mean high quality or first-class humans. But often in the suttas they're talking about a Brahma God, which was not even a concept in the time of the Buddha. And the devas are like the kind of devas that you would have in Hollywood, not the kinds that you have painted on the side of a church.

**Speaker B:** Celebrity, I say.

**Speaker A:** Yes, celebrities. That's what the deva means. And what this deva manu sanam— the manu there is the high-quality humans like tradesmen, carpenters, landowners, merchants, that kind of quality of a person, as opposed to the Puttajanav, which is your ordinary dirt laborer, no education, don't know nothing, and is very magical-oriented. And those are the ones that are hard to train, are the ones who are very magical-oriented. But those who have an education or a high quality those are the targets for, uh, the Buddha. That's why that is in there. And it's right there in the Pali, but because they make it, uh, gods and men is how they translate it. You're not translated like that. It doesn't mean gods and men. It means, it means your higher status of,

**Speaker B:** uh, uh, from the caste system, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just talking about the caste system. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay, fascinating.

**Speaker A:** It is, it really is, that the real teachings of the Buddha in fact are not very magical, but there's a lot of magical thinking from people, and that the very clear example of that is here in Thailand. Where for some reason or another, part of the history that I don't really have knowledge of, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa became well known and friends of some very high people in the aristocracy of Thailand that was concerned with the judiciary, the judges, those would also be the source of the politicians. For instance, even in the United States, most of the politicians are lawyers. So we're talking about the lawyer class, the lawyer, the legal people, all of that kind of stuff. There was a primary university in Bangkok that was the Harvard of Thai, OK? And they brought buses down every weekend, several buses, so there's like 150 or so students that are coming from this university every week during the 1980s, because it's gotten very much organized. But it goes way, way back. Robert is currently translating a book that hasn't been translated into English yet, of a series of 12 lectures that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa gave over a series of months called The Rain in Rapunzel at what would in the United States be the equivalent of the large auditorium of the Justice Department. That's it. Okay. Right. And that it was all of the judiciary, all of the high judges, many of the students, all the lawyers were the students of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, almost en masse. And this was happening in the 1950s.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow.

**Speaker A:** He had gotten that popular in that group. And so his reputation has now been really— they still send buses from Anapanasati University down to Mexico. And he'd been dead 30 years and they still said Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. So that's the kind of thing, and that's why it's easier for people to understand just how popular Bhikkhu Buddhadasa got in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Sorry about that. Interesting. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So there's a, there's a huge place in Bangkok, um, gosh, if the property was sold now, it'd probably be worth maybe a quarter of a billion dollars. Wow, it is so huge, uh, and it is in literally downtown Bangkok, and it's all part— it is so large they've got a lake And they use the lake to walk around to do walking meditation and whatnot like that. And so there's got— there's so much money in it. And that's— there's a website called via.org, which is, uh, Buddhadasa Ittapanya Archives. It's the archives. And you can just Google Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Most of the stuff that's there is still in Thai language. That's it. But there are literally hundreds of books in English, and most of that happened simply because they bothered to record what he had to say since the 1950s, uh, to record it. And so they've got huge tape libraries that they keep reproducing and making it digital and trying to preserve it. Oh great, people still trying to translate other stuff. He was very famous for one thing, was that on the full moon night before the Pansa ceremony the next day, it's traditional for the monks to sit up together all night. It's a tradition. And that would be the time when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would start talking at about 2 in the morning. And finish in time for the student, for everyone to go out to bend about it, about 7. Wow,

**Speaker B:** that sounds tough.

**Speaker A:** And, and, and so all of those talks and lectures have been recorded over the years, but, and so little of it has actually been put into English, uh, but that it shows of the the enormity of the impact that he had. But here, let me tell you the story behind that, because he didn't do much of anything different than his teachers and predecessors have done before, with one little thing which I'll get to in just a moment. Okay, what he was doing, uh, he was actually a Pali scholar and going through the scholarly things of, uh, they've got 9 levels of Pali, and he started to argue with the teachers about what the words mean in the Thai, uh, and so He also became notable and would give public talks, and so he was giving a public talk at a university, basically the equivalent of a graduation talk, to a wide variety, but I think that it was at a nursing school. And in that talk, there were people in the audience who did not like at all what he was saying, because he was speaking at a noble level. I don't ever know what was in that talk, but I do know the story that it caught attention, and it got back into the school that he was in, which was one of the main parts of it. And they wound up having a thing called a Sangha Dassesa, and a Sangha Dassesa has many different definitions, but really the deep part of it is, is that a division in the Sangha— Sangha deceased is the way you look at it, okay? The destruction of the Sangha, because they were saying that he was teaching heresy. He would teach something that would destroy the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** What was he teaching?

**Speaker A:** What was he teaching? He was teaching Anatta. He was teaching Noble Dhamma. He was not teaching at a university in a public audience about Sila and rebirth and all of the beginning humble stuff that you teach children, that he taught right from the get-go the very best of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** That's the good stuff.

**Speaker A:** And that there was fear in that in Thailand, and you can see part part of the fear is that one fear would be, oh, if everybody figured out what the Buddha actually taught, they would stop building these fancy marvelous wats and temples. So that's one fear. And also, they may stop supporting me because I've been the one who is feeding them all of that stuff so that they would build all of these fancy temples Because I mean, we're talking about the people right at the top of the whole show. That's why it got to be such a big deal called the Sangha Daccesa. So here they come getting together, 20 of the best known high-class monks in Bangkok to have a Sangha Daccesa about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And he defended himself with suttas. And in the process of developing, uh, defending himself with the suttas and what the words actually meant and things like that— for instance, I gave you the word deva. They can be used as an ordinary word. Why make it magical, right? Right, exactly. Why make it magical when it doesn't have to be? We should only— we should leave magic to where they're actually spelling it out in great detail. Magic, not have to use the word, but you get what I'm talking about. Actually flying the air, what does that mean? Does that mean a sensation or a feeling of weightlessness? Because you can do that and still be on the ground. Or does it mean the monk just shows up right behind you as if he had just floated into the room, where in fact he just had been walking meditation, and he walks

**Speaker B:** Silently. I see, I see.

**Speaker A:** So much for the flying monks, but back to the story about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was that he had friends on the inside that he didn't know about. Yeah, he had some high-class friends who knew exactly what he was saying was exactly correct, that the nobility of Thailand was alive and well within the Sangha, and that those who want it can have it. But if you don't ask, they don't tell. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa wanted to change that. He says, no, it's time to let it out, that yes, there were dangerous times. And still it's a bit dangerous. And that he actually got people to befriend him with that notion too. But there was a side point, and that is that he literally sparked a reinvestigation of the suttas for the Thai aristocracy, the top group of the monks. Everything that they had been taught in the Pali classes and all that kind of stuff got reevaluated

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And that was kind of marvelous. And so in a way, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did spark a revolution, but he was only the spark. The fuel was already there, right? And he sparked that off, and he made some pretty, pretty high-class friends, including one of them who became his teacher. Because he was only just an Anagami, only about 10 years a monk then. He was not an Arahant, he was not top. That was the other thing that was a little bit of a trouble, is how dare this upstart of only 10 years as a monk go around telling us what Pali means? You know, we've been at it 30, 40, 50 years now.

**Speaker B:** That's a good question.

**Speaker A:** But he did take on a teacher. The teacher he took on, he had many, many conversations in writing back and forth in the mail because his teacher remained in Bangkok when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa came back here to the south of Thailand. And a lot of that stuff has not been translated, and we've got a whole lot of people who are really waiting to hear what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and his teacher talked about. During the 1930s and '40s.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** But his teacher was, um, uh, uh, Ajahn Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Jern. Now you probably heard the name. Yeah, yeah. So this is Buddhaghosa Jern, and he was no less than the sum depth of Thailand. And now the Sumdet is also where we could use the words Sangha Raj, is the king of the Sangha. He was the head, headest monk. He was the top when it comes to ceremonial, when it becomes, you know, there's this, uh, but he doesn't set any rules. It's like the reigning king, okay, rather than an actual administrator. But he does oversee all of the administration And one of the administrations that they do, for instance, is the Bureau of Religious Affairs is a huge bureaucracy, mostly of laymen, but the board are all monks. The Bureau of Religious Affairs are Buddhist monks in Thailand, period. And they set what all the policies are. And that that Bureau of Religious Affairs is also headed by the Samadhi Sangha. Right, so you can see there's political connections, there is Sangha connections, it's the whole nine yards. And this guy was Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's teacher. Do you think that didn't open doors for Bhikkhuni? Wow, wow. And so that's how the noble Dharma snuck out of this sack in Thailand. It always had been there, but it was always under the rule of "you don't ask, we don't tell."

**Speaker B:** Yeah, almost came from the inside out, right?

**Speaker A:** It has to come from when the student is really ready for it. But Bhikkhu Buddhisattva says, you know, I think it's about time for all of humanity to be ready for that the Buddha did say, "Deva Manussanam." In fact, that was part of the proof that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was using, was that the actual definition was, "He doesn't teach gods and men, he teaches you very high-class quality people," the Noble Dhamma. So there were many, many connections that reverberate. Through understanding what the actual Pali is using, versus the intellectual Westernized stuff. That in fact, all of the modern Pali dictionaries are all based upon the Polytechnic Society's original lexicon. Dictionary, which was put together by Christians. The real scholars who went to India and put all of this stuff together and began to find out the bits and pieces of it mostly was collected in Sri Lanka. And so they went to Sri Lanka and started studying it, but they were from Oxford and Cambridge, and there were scholars. We know them. Very well. In fact, we're very grateful to the original stuff done by A.B. Hohner and Riles Davies and his wife, uh, that they, they were the ones who did all of the hard work of trying to put together what this really weird language was. But now there's so much more about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So would you consider those translations like unskillful still?

**Speaker A:** If you can see skill as a rainbow, or you can see one level of skill but not another level of skill, or you can see a combination of skills so that they're very, very skilled in this part but they're not very skilled at this part over here. Okay, okay. And so in that regard, yes, they're very, very skilled at making sure that— how to say— that they have justification for every word.

**Speaker B:** That's good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, justification for every word. I translated it this way, or this is how I put this sentence together, so that they can justify by it, at least in their own mind. That's like you can't see the forest for the trees, right? Because you're looking at every word, looking at every tree, and you miss the fact that you're in a forest. And that's the part that I'm actually— I have a relationship with a good friend who, he learned Thai because he was a Mormon who wanted to send missionaries. He came to Thailand as a Mormon missionary and that even though he learned Thai language in school very well, he was still very shy but he started talking to the kids and that's where he really picked up Thai language is from the kids in Thailand and from them. From the kids, he picks up Buddha. Ah, okay. And so now, uh, part of the profession that he does is he does translations of contracts and all kinds of stuff. He's really, really top-notch scholar in Buddhism, but he hasn't— he's been back to the United States once in 10 years.

**Speaker B:** Can't blame him.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, so he's a big fan of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and is actually on their translator list.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, what's his name?

**Speaker A:** Uh, his name is Robert Bass. Okay, if you want to meet him, I can send you the link because he's part of— he's part of our club. He's one of our— he's one of their insiders. I'm inviting you in.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that sounds awesome.

**Speaker A:** So, um, anyway, this is all about back to the Pali, and this is where, uh, it's interesting because Robert studies the suttas in Thai language. That's how he gets to the Pali, is through Thai, even though his native language is English.

**Speaker B:** Is Pali close to Thai?

**Speaker A:** No, but the way they translate the words makes different meanings than they do in the English.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And, and that in fact, in the Thai, one of the words that's translated differently than you would expect is that they translate the word Citta Citta, they don't translate it as the word mind, they translate it as the word heart in Thai. And the Thai word for heart is jai. And the word jai is used in all kinds of places: jai yen, jai ron, jai ni. Many, many little particle words are put together to make an entire vocabulary that we would have for emotions. And so not just, just heart, but it's— jairon is anger, jayan is cool. You can hear the word yin. So a cool heart, a hot heart, a bright heart, a dark heart, a black heart.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so all of the emotions in the Thai language are used around this word heart, and that's the word that is used used for this word Citta, and when you understand it like that, then the Satipatthana makes a whole lot more sense. Because in fact, the frontal cortex, the higher quality of the mind, is actually spoken of in the Pali differently as the Manu. Remember the Manu? Dhammarato, it's the same word, so the Manu now is used as the higher mind, the human, that's where the word man and human and woman all come from, is that we're higher than the other animals. The Citta is the lower part of the mind that needs to be trained. Yeah, and that's obvious and evident in the Pali, but, but, but in the English they all translated to just mind without making the distinction that's actually in the Pali.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes a big difference. Wow.

**Speaker A:** So that's— there are just so many things that are like that that can be picked up once you begin to play with the Pali language, if you're really interested in what actual Buddha taught. Yeah, and I'm looking for students who get interested in the Pali. Yeah, I would like it because I would like to see a whole team put together of people who really know what the Dhamma actually said. And then let's put out an English language translation of what actually is there, not what the first cut was. Thank you very much for that first cut. Without it, we could not do our jobs, right? But we needed to put a new face on this thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's really cool that it's almost like secret knowledge to bring out. That's really cool. Yeah, I'm definitely interested. Okay, I'll look into that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I then would guide the students towards Sutta Central.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because Sutta Central has Bhikkhu— I think it's Subhattu? No, Subha. Bhikkhu Subha has done An outstanding work of so much stuff. How much stuff that guy's done is unbelievable. In fact, there's only really one way that he could have done it, and that is by having it automated. And you can see the threads of automation under there, that he's used some Google Translate or something, but he's put it together. And now you can go in line by line with the Pali and the English Oh wow. And not only that, but they have a rollover Pali dictionary so that you can check the actual dictionary and its depth of what that word means. But a lot of them it doesn't know because they're joined together and run on, but you can begin to see a thread. Yeah, like in fact the word Piti and Piti Sukkha are often used. Piti Sukkha is one word.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and we can also see like a dukkha, a sukka Vedana, and that's translated as neutral Vedana, but in fact it's not neutral, it's a sukka, a dukkha, which means I don't know whether I like it or not, and it's a confused feeling. Oh, it's very easy to understand that from the Pali, but from English they will translate it to neutral feeling because they don't really know what's going on under there.

**Speaker B:** That's ironic.

**Speaker A:** You have to divide the word up to see what's really going on, and then you check, oh yeah, now I got it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, fascinating. Thank you for sharing. That's really cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, I— it's a, it's a toy. Not only that, but you can actually, uh, go into YouTube and Google or YouTube search for the word Pali, P-A-L-I. And there's an entire group, a channel of dozens of videos that follow various books so that you can just turn the video on in Pali and learn about the syntax and learn about the, uh, a bit of the— they don't— they're not really strong on vocabulary building, but they're certainly good on grammar.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that's really helpful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To know some of the grammar, because then you begin to see that Anapanasati and Hontu are the same word. One's singular, one's plural.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Bhikkhuni is plural.

**Speaker B:** Changing the end of the word.

**Speaker A:** Changing the end of the word changes, so that's singular and plural. But it's singular and plural present tense because it has— even though it's a verb, it still has not just case and tense like English, but it also has to agree with the noun in gender. And, and, and person in the sense of, uh, first, second, third person. So it's very, very complex, these— into these words. And you wind up being— all the language is really simple. Basically what you learn to do is to pick out what is an ending and what is not and throw the endings out. They don't mean anything anymore. They're just too complicated. Let's go after another bird and forget

**Speaker B:** about all these endings.

**Speaker A:** But I did share one of the endings with you, and that is the, uh, the, uh, M sound. Yeah, often done with a dot over it. Okay, okay, like them and him and whom. That sound at the end, which by the way I think gives the word Om in the Hindu. It's the same ending.

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, interesting.

**Speaker A:** It really is.

**Speaker B:** Language is so fascinating.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we've got roots in English, so the Pali itself. That's the connection. Everything is so connected.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Okay, yeah, that's some homework.

**Speaker A:** So do you have any other questions? Shall we talk about now that we've talked about Pali?

**Speaker B:** Let's talk about the Dharma. I was hoping to talk a little bit about like anger, frustration, and like disappointment. I'm sure you get this a lot, and I guess the context would be like, I have small children, and I

**Speaker A:** noticed that— Aren't they called delightful? They can be. So you're Anagami and you're pushing them, but they're not. They could, but they would. Sorry about that. No, it's fine. No, you're absolutely right.

**Speaker B:** I find that when I'm alone, it's very easy to not just practice, but— I don't know how to describe it. It just feels easier alone in general, right? And then when I'm around either— it's not necessarily children, but let's just say family. Let's blanket it with family. I just notice it's harder to remember.

**Speaker A:** You use that word "them."

**Speaker B:** You know what I mean, though? It's hard to remember what we talk about, basically. Remember, you know, what to do, I guess.

**Speaker A:** There is a sutta where the Buddha talks about this very thing, and in there is the analogy that I have come to refer to, uh, almost as a catchphrase, as the log in the bog.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so imagine a log there Laying in the bog, probably a cypress tree or something. They had bogs and swamps in India, and trees fall over. And they also had professional firemakers back then. Nowadays it's really easy to set a fire, but firemakers were actually a profession, as well as something that was associated with the the temple. So fire was also kind of sacred in a way with fire temples. And I think that that was part of the roots of Zoroastrianism as an influence. It had been in India for 1,000 years before— yeah, the Buddha. Uh, so you've got a fire maker coming to try to set that log on fire, the one in the bog. Can he actually set that fire on with his fire-making tool? Rules, can he set that log on fire? No, too wet. All right, well, what if he takes that log and sets it out on the beach? He drags it out of the bog and sets it up on dry land. Can he then set it on fire?

**Speaker B:** Eventually, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you use the word eventually intentionally, huh? So right after he pulls it out, he still can't light the fire, but if he leaves it there, both the sun and gravity will work to his advantage so that at least he can get the top part of the log to get caught on fire. And in fact, that's a good way to do good work on a dugout canoe. Isn't that interesting? And that's how dugout canoes got funny about that.

**Speaker B:** Whoa, whoa.

**Speaker A:** So now we're understanding that this is the analogy that the Buddha uses about Sukkha. Conclusion that we, the log, if we're going to get the mind set on fire into the wholesome, then we have to pull it out of the bog of the unwholesome. And so we need to remove ourselves. This is what the Westerners have caught on to be meditation, which actually has more to do with seclusion while practicing Anapanasati. Rather than all about Anapanasati. It's just at this time we're doing it when we can get away from it all, because that's literally what we're trying to do, is to get away from it all so that we can get down to the fact that we can't get away from it all. Because we can't— even though we can close the door, we still brought the world in there. It's still in there. Okay, right. And so One's right effort then is that any kind of worldly thought comes into the mind, we can catch that and say, "No, no, you're not going to come into the mind right now," or, "I'm not going to entertain you. We're going to have wholesome thoughts instead." So we keep changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, and in the sutta, that it actually says this is one's right effort when they're actually talking about how to apply the Eightfold Noble Path. This is it. This is the key ingredient. One's right effort is to change the content of the mind from unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. And that we can do that best when we're in seclusion to get started. Because the world will just automatically throw unwholesome thoughts all over us. Yeah, and kids are really excellent at it. Your kids know exactly where your buttons are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, definitely right.

**Speaker A:** And so we need to practice in the beginning to, uh, to learn to ignore these buttons actually in the mind, because the buttons that they push around the mind. And so we begin to uncover these buttons, and one by one, as we see them, we make kind of the conclusion that, hey, that's dangerous, and I'm not going to be pushing that button anymore. Yeah, okay, I'm going to not have that kind of thought. I'm going to start guarding the mind for what's wholesome and what is not wholesome.

**Speaker B:** That's interesting, you use the word dangerous. I never considered that because it's so easy to just— well, it is, it's easy to just not think about it and just go with that, whatever that feeling that comes in, and be taken by it. But to think of it as dangerous really reframes it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that was the way that the Buddha used that word. In the sense that the ordinary mind sees the delight in whatever it is, whatever you've got in your mind. But I could use the word donut, but the guy only sees the delight in the donut and he can't resist it. But if you can see the danger in that donut, now he's got a doorway into the resistance of the donut, which means the escape from the donut, I can actually escape from that donut by reminding myself how dangerous it is. So this is what we mean then, is by when we say, when we see an unwholesome thought as unwholesome, that means that we can see the danger, we can see the Dukkha in it, almost in the sense of, "Ooga, ooga, Dukkha, 5 seconds ahead, 5 seconds ahead, watch out!"

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it becomes a huge red flag.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So you start leaving these red flags out so that when these unwholesome thoughts come, we can flag them and remove them and say, wow, I don't have to think that way. I don't have to think about it like that. I can be happy and joyful instead. Right.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. This is the teaching of the Buddha that's all over the place in so many people miss is this quality of gladdening the mind. That's how it's called in the Anapanasati Sutta. Removal of the hindrances is just all over the place. Every time that the hindrances are mentioned, they're mentioned in the sense of that when you catch it, you have to remove it. And then also occasionally in many other suttas, it will have that there are 5 analogies for these hindrances, and the analogies are actually quite powerful. And you can see that people will say, "Well, 5 hindrances and 5 analogies, that means they're exactly one-on-one." No, actually you begin to see through these analogies how they are similar together, you begin to see the similarity in the 5 hindrances. And so it's much more like this rather than like that. They all kind of come together so that we can begin to see that, oh, well, desire will call restlessness. And, oh, right, doubt is mixed in there. And, you know, and then everything begins to see, well, all of that stuff is all connected together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see that.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so the Five Analogies is one that you feel, and then you get well, that you're in the hospital, and that day that you want out of the hospital, you really want out. Have you ever been in the hospital? Do you remember? Yeah. Do you really want out of there, right? Yeah. That's what we're talking about, that you're raring to go. I want out of here. Okay. And so, but when you were sick, you actually wanted to be in the hospital. Right, yeah, yeah. Okay, so the hindrances are then like being sick, and you actually are okay being sick, okay being in the hospital because we're sick. But when we start to feel good, all of a sudden, hey man, I want out of here. Yeah, yeah. And this is one of the analogies that when you get— that being, being free from the hindrance It's like getting, getting over being sick and how much better we feel. And we want to go now. Mm-hmm. Okay. The next analogy is the one that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa really, really spends a lot of time with. And that's like being in prison, talking about the prison of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, in a way, being prison is like being sick because in prison you can't go where you want to go. You can't do what you want to do that you're, you're You're bound. And prison is kind of like a hell because you don't want to be here, right? You can't get out. Where in the hospital you want out and you know you're going to get out. But in prison, you want out, you're not getting out. Don't get out of here. That's the feeling of prison. And you don't get out. All of a sudden you're out. How does that feel when finally you're released from it? Yeah, wow, what a feeling! These hindrances is because I was doomed to be in hell. I was rotting in prison and now somebody sprung me. That's why they use that word sprung, is because it feels that way, just launched right into the air. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** The next of the analogies, uh, is, is the analogy of being a servant, like the servant to a king. The servant to the king has to get up before the king does, get dressed, get ready to get— when the king wakes up, to dress him and feed him and get him. And then he has to follow him around all day. And when the last thing that happens is the king retires, the servant has to get him dressed for bed and everything like that. And after the king retires, only then now can the servant get any rest.

**Speaker B:** King or children?

**Speaker A:** You have understood my Point precisely, exactly, exactly. So it's like all day long we're in service or we're in duty to something. Yeah, you have to do it, and we don't have much choice about doing it. Well, in a way, that's again kind of like a prison. In a way, again, it's kind of like being sick. Okay, and so the next one then, uh, the analogy is imagine that you're in debt and then you finally sell whatever it is that you needed to sell, made enough profit, and now you can pay off the debt, and now you're free from debt. Or imagine paying off the mortgage, or paying off the car loan, or paying off the student loan, or whatever it is that people are in debt for now. What a relief that I don't owe anybody anything. Completely free from debt. No monthly payments. Well, maybe one or two. Yeah, one, the rent. Number two, the internet.

**Speaker B:** The important stuff, right?

**Speaker A:** And so those are the only two, but neither one of those are in fact debts, because see, I can choose or not to have the internet anytime. Yeah, or I can choose to pay the rent or not and have a place to live. So that's always up to date. So neither one of those are debts. Debts are things when you don't want to pay them, you have to anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like paying for a mistake almost.

**Speaker A:** All right, that's why you buy that car. That's a mistake and you're going to pay for it for 5 years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see the analogy. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so this is the Buddha's analogy of feeling like this. So what's it like to be completely free from death? It's very much like the feeling of I don't have any work to do right now, that I don't have to be at the beck and call of the king every moment, and that I can find ways of getting out of prison, and I can find ways of feeling good, that I can in fact change the way that I feel. But it don't have to be sick. Okay, so the final one now is the one that's very interesting, and that is the analogy of having a bunch of baggage that you're carrying on a trip. With the original analogy was that you're in a caravan with all of your years' worth of goods that you bought, and you're taking them back home, and that you're crossing the desert And all of the dangers of the thieves and of broken legs on the camels and the dead camels and everything can go wrong and anything that will can go wrong. And then you finally make it home, make it home. Oh yeah, and everything is okay. You've got all— every camel is still alive and all your baggage is just standing there. No thieves got any of it. And you've made it. In fact, this baggage may be exactly what you use to pay your debts with, right, to keep yourself out of debtor's prison. And on it goes. So you want to see— wait a minute, these things are all the same. Yeah, right. And being free from the hindrances is like being free from all of those things. Yeah. And yet so many meditation systems don't teach this in the sense of This is the practice of the Buddha, is to be free from this stuff any and every time we think about it, to come out of this harmful, wholesome, unwholesome state and come into wholesome thoughts. And we begin to practice that over and over again till we get— begin to get good at it. Now, uh, one of the analogies that I'm using nowadays is the one out of Sutta 19, where the The Buddha talks about a cowherd that has to take the cows down the trail, but along the trail there are people with their food stalls, or the kids are out there, or whatever like that. And so this cowherd has to make sure that these cows don't do any damage along the way, because if they do some damage, somebody's going to harm him and put him in jail, bust his shops, take his cows, whatever. And so, he is making sure that these cows are going down the straight and narrow. Now, this is exactly the kind of thing that we want to think about for the new students, or in fact, for the Buddha himself as he began to do this, is to start watching every thought, to make sure that this thought is not going to stray off into stepping on some child. No pun intended, believe me. But you got my drift. Great. Yeah, this is exactly what we're talking about, that we learn to try to keep these thoughts wholesome And the best place to do that is when we're only dealing with our own mind, not real cows and real kids. We do this inside the mind so that we can get the mind into a wholesome state. And then once we get it into a wholesome state, that means that this is when we apply the mind to the wholesome and sustain it. In the wholesome, so that we have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. And if the mind strays into an unwholesome area, we bring it back into the wholesome, over and over and over again, just like the cowherd has to hit the cow with a stick to keep them in line. Because they're likely to stray out. Well, once he gets them out of town and gets them to the pasture, say where they have already cut the straw or cut the rice down and there's still straw in the pail, now he doesn't have to watch them so close because he knows all of the cows are wholesome and where they are is okay. Yeah, so now he doesn't have to work so hard.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all we have to do is just keep noting that the thoughts are wholesome. These are wholesome thoughts. Everything is all right. Everything is okay, everything is fine. And so we begin to have wholesome thoughts about what's happening in the present moment. We can also have wholesome thoughts in the sense of this is the way things are, not just right this very moment, the nearness of the present moment, but things that are also now that have been here for a long time and will remain here. There are some things that just are what we would call reality, the 'are' part of the reality. Okay, and we could then say that, wait a minute, the Four Noble Truths are like this. They just are. That's why they're noble, is because they were there in the beginning, they're there in the middle, they're going to be there in the end. They're just always there. This is why the Buddha was able to call them noble, because he knew that they had been there all along.

**Speaker B:** Aha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what makes them noble, is because here they are and they haven't changed a smidgen since the Buddha. That's what makes them noble. And we have some other noble things like elements. Some of the elements are noble is because they don't mess with nothing. Argon is one of the noble gases, and that was why it was the one that it was first used in light bulbs, because no matter how hot that filament got, the Argon was not going to eat it, wouldn't have anything to do. Oh wow, it's noble. Okay, so nobility in that regard says ain't having nothing to do with it.

**Speaker B:** Interesting, I did not know that. Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** And so we actually can apply our own mind that way, in the sense, I ain't going to have nothing to do with that Mara. I ain't going to have nothing to do with those unwholesome thoughts. So we're going to have a noble mind that only interacts with or allows noble thoughts, including the noble thought of the Four Noble Truths. This is Dukkha, this is the source of Dukkha. In other words, by investigating deeply into the Second Noble Truth, we begin to figure out how the mind actually works, and that is the teaching then of the Buddha of Paticcasamuppada, which you've probably heard before. Dependent origination.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Oh, interbeing isn't another term for it? I don't think that's a real word, but I've heard that phrase a lot. Interbeing. Uh,

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure. That's a very loose translation for sure.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But basically what he's talking about is cause and effect. In fact, the Second Noble Truth is the cause of suffering. So now we're going to begin to take that word cause and really expand it to see exactly how ignorance causes suffering, how ill will causes suffering, how anger causes suffering. In fact, that shows us by understanding this that anger is dangerous. Because anger can cause suffering, but if we can't see that anger is dangerous, then that means that we've got both anger and ignorance, right? Because we cannot see how dangerous the anger is. We can only see the delight of I'm right and you're wrong and I'm going to prove it and you've got to do my way and give me what I want. That's what anger is all about. So with that, we don't see the danger. We can see the danger when someone else pulls their anger on us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** But we cannot see the anger as dangerous when it is here in one's own mind.

**Speaker B:** When it's my idea, right?

**Speaker A:** When it's my angry, it's not dangerous angry, right? No, I— right, I'm such a gentle being. I'm going to tear your throat out. But I'm doing it gently.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I think I'm starting to see specifically why I forget in these moments. And I think it's because when the mind is primarily in unwholesome thoughts, then doubt prevails, as sort of like I start to forget that I was successful with this, and then the doubt takes over and I think, well, was I really, or have I been making this up?

**Speaker A:** Or— Exactly. So this is why it's so valuable to keep practicing getting ourselves even into a little bit of Sukkha, into a little bit of satisfaction. Any satisfaction at all is good satisfaction. Wanting our satisfaction, or how small it is, to be better than it is or bigger than it is, is not satisfaction at all. Right. So something strange about this stuff— sound satisfying, right? To become satisfied. This is okay.

**Speaker B:** Now, is there a situation you can imagine where that would just not be true? Where I would be lying to myself.

**Speaker A:** Uh, the ultimate question then would be, what is going to be on your mind in your last blind moment upon death? Uh-huh. Could you have a wholesome thought then?

**Speaker B:** I hope so.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's practice. I'm going to be ready for that one. But by doing it that way, then we can begin to say, okay, I can also put on that not-to-do list, like not to feel bad upon death, not to feel bad when daughter comes and pushes buttons.

**Speaker B:** And then when I fail to be easy on myself for it, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. It's okay. She doesn't get to you. She's working very hard. Congratulate her for how hard she's working at getting under your skin, and she can't do it. Haha. And so you're both to be congratulated. One, look how hard she tried. And number two, look the fact that she couldn't do it this time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true. I've actually been thinking about this a lot in reincarnation and kind of reframing that to really just be every moment.

**Speaker A:** You're reborn every moment. The question is, are you going to be reborn as an animal? Are you going to be reborn in hell? Are you going to be reborn in a woeful state of wanting something you can't have? Are you going to be born in the state of being afraid, all dressed up and no place to go? Or worse still, all dressed in battle and afraid to march out into war like McClellan? Do you know the story of McClellan?

**Speaker B:** I don't.

**Speaker A:** McClellan was the general of the army for the North in the Civil War. He trained the army to perfection, but he wouldn't take them into battle. He finally— Lincoln had to replace him. And that's why Grant won, was because Grant had crackerjack troops all ready to go to battle but couldn't. So, Nicole, okay. And we get like that. We're afraid to go and act. We got everything we need. I mean, people do that all the time. They don't want to go to that interview. Right, and they long and desperately want out of the job they're in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's just another kind of being reborn, of wanting something that you don't have, but this time it's because you're afraid of failure. I mean, boys do that with girls all the time.

**Speaker B:** I see. It's always my choice. Every— you know, I choose where I'm going to be reborn.

**Speaker A:** Basically, well, uh, basically no, that's not the case. Basically what is the case is, is that you are reborn according to your habits of how you have been in the habit of being reborn. The Buddha actually talks about this. I finally found passages in the sutta where he's directly referring to habits about how we repetitively do things, and he talks about it in the sense of, uh, If the mind inclines in that direction, then that is what we've become.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's our habits. So the way you feel is not how you want to feel. You don't make the choice to feel that way. It's the way that you feel in habit, ignorance. Okay, if you wake up, if you wake up to how the daughter contacts you, then you can feel any way you want to about it, right? Including, look how silly she is right now. Well, I think that's really funny.

**Speaker B:** I see. Yeah, it's a subtle shift. I'm not causing the thought, I'm just reevaluating the thought, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Right. Are you beginning to wake up to the fact that you do have a choice? Yeah, that in fact you were saying that you have those choices. Generally people don't choose to feel bad. Generally they feel bad out of habit, that when they begin to choose how they're going to feel, they tend to feel good. Yeah. And if they choose to feel bad in some way or another, that's because they're still missing a piece. An example of that was that I used to, I used to be really good at rage when I really wasn't angry. Because it got me what I wanted, I thought. And then I had to put down that one too.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. I can see that. I can see that with like complaining too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. And so when we get to the point in wholesome mind that we don't have anything at all to complain about on the inside, then how could we possibly complain to someone on the outside?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just making trouble.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like that cow going down the trail, you know, stepping on people. You know, we got to keep the mind out of that. We gotta get them to where they're walking right. Right. Okay, but once we get to the destination of having only wholesome thoughts, now we can relax because we know that only wholesome thoughts are there. And so that's how we can— that's what we mean by sustaining the first jhana, which is a major skill point, and sustaining just one wholesome thought after another after another.

**Speaker B:** Ah, so what you're saying is there's no shortcut in the moment?

**Speaker A:** Well, no, I am saying that in this moment you can have a wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** That's true, that's true. I can always short-circuit it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, then it's always— and have a wholesome thought. Let's have wholesome thoughts so that once we get good at having wholesome thoughts, then we can really relax. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Do you have any strategies for persistent, like the same thought?

**Speaker A:** Let's say

**Speaker B:** we talked about pain the other day, and I understand that pain is in the mind, but on some

**Speaker A:** level— yeah, you still don't like it even though you know that intellectually,

**Speaker B:** right? So let's say that I'm in pain and I'm trying to reframe that and saying like, this is okay, or whatever, and then I'm just bombarded back with the unwholesome, like No, no, you're wrong. Like, you need to do something about this.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, here's one of the things then that I think a lot of people don't understand, but the Buddha has said it in several ways and in several places, is that there's no reason to give ourselves an undue burden. All right, that if you're sitting in a posture that gives you pain, then it really is proper for you to adjust your posture to give yourself ease. I even know of suttas to where the Buddha did that also when his back was hurting. Even though there were people there, he gave the teaching to Ananda while the Buddha took a nap. I carried a big group of people. Now how does that grab you? All right, so take care of yourself. Don't sit because, "Oh, I'm supposed to be meditating and I'm supposed to be able to get over this pain." No, give yourself the ease. Make things easy.

**Speaker B:** Doesn't that interfere with concentration?

**Speaker A:** No, the pain interferes with concentration.

**Speaker B:** That's true, yeah.

**Speaker A:** What?

**Speaker B:** But if I'm moving frequently, then that would also be disruptive.

**Speaker A:** Not if you do it mindfully.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's true.

**Speaker A:** And slowly and caressingly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And gently allow yourself to be at ease.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, I get it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I find it really amusing when we keep talking about Anapanasati, of putting wholesome thoughts in our mind. It says, yeah, all right, I'll have all the wholesome thoughts I have so long as I don't have to deal with this pain. And the whole point of it is that— wait a minute, wait a minute— pain itself, the word, is an unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so we're already in the unwholesome. What are we going to do now?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Well, we want to get out of the pain, to get out of that, right? Okay, so that's the first thing. Yeah, be easy on yourself. Don't give yourself pain.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so what if, what if the, the quote pain is not physical? What if it is like the pain or fear of what my responsibilities.

**Speaker A:** Then aha, because those responsibilities are not right here. There is no boss screaming in your ear right now. If there is— wait a minute, wait a minute. No, that's not, that's not your boss. That's you screaming in your ear right now.

**Speaker B:** That's true, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Important distinction, because you can't do a whole lot about the boss himself screaming in your ear, but we can do something about you screaming in your ear.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Really can. We can say, hey man, lay off. Yeah, we're having a break here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I am hard on myself. That's true.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know why you're hard on yourself?

**Speaker B:** Because I have a goal, I have plans.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you figured out that if you're hard on yourself, then that'll keep other people from being hard on you. And so you kind of think that being hard on yourself is easier than letting everybody else be hard on you. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** your psychologist is coming out. You're absolutely right.

**Speaker A:** So they— yeah, so they say. Yeah, exactly, that we often do that, and that it really is very easy to see. I'm really glad that psychologists know all about that. They really picked up on that good. In fact, Freud knew all about it and has been part of psychology ever since. Guess what? The Buddha saw it 2,500 years ago. So yes, so that whole thing then is that it's called Sila Bhante Paramasa in the Pali, and what that means is Actually, the translation is kind of not very helpful— accurate but not very helpful. And when it says attachment to rites, rules, and rituals, but then we think, wait a minute, rites, rules, and rituals are only what they do at the temple. No, rites, rules, and rituals about the entire society and how everything is supposed to work. All your shoulds, all your coulds, all your goals are all stored in this concept about how things should be. If you were the king of the world, how would you make it? That's your list of rules, is to make you the king of the world so you can get everything you want and do it just your way, including to keep people off my back. I'm going to get on my own back.

**Speaker B:** I see. Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but there's always a bunch of self in there protecting the self. The wisdom then is to recognize, wait a minute, that self is transient anyway. And because it comes and goes, it really doesn't need any protection at all. I mean, I can kill it dead and it'll be back in 3 minutes, so what difference does it make, right? Yeah, yeah, it just comes and goes and comes and goes. And not only that, but it comes, and when it does come, we call it selfish. Yeah, the problem with the Pali in this regard is, is that that word Anatta, if you understand the word anatta, since we've already been talking about Pali. This is, this is a light, juicy one, okay? The word anatta, the word atta, is used in Mahatma Gandhi's name. Mahatma. Yeah, okay, Mahatma. But it's just concatenated the A's together is to Mahatma, but it means great soul. And the word atma is exactly that. And I originally thought that it came from the word in the Greek for atom, A-T-O-M, but I was corrected by a scholarly friend of mine that no, it comes from the word A-T-M-O, not A-T-O-M. And the evidence of that is the word A-T-O-M was later in Greek and was only introduced as a concept in about 500 BC, coinciding with the Buddha. And therefore, that's not what the Buddha meant. Now, the word atom means not cuttable. So we used atoms in the same— in the sense of, yeah, water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen, but oxygen and hydrogen can't be broken down, so they thought when they used that word. They were wrong. We can break down oxygen. There's no end to it. And that's what the Buddha is kind of pointing out, is that there is no end to it. So he's saying, ah, atom, except that that's not the right word. The actual right word is atmos, that gives us the word atmosphere. And the Buddha is saying, yes, the atmosphere with the word spirit built right into it doesn't have a self, that there is no wisdom or knowledge. It just is. There's no atmos. That's what the word anatta means by the time we get it translated and spoken into modern speech of the Pali, but the root of the word is the same as the word of atmosphere, the air around us, that which surrounds us and encompasses us and everything. Now in the Vedanta, and in some, I think it's Pajñāntali, but I'm not quite sure, they talk of that as the great self. The little self is the me that breathes in and out. But what I'm breathing in out is the big self.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Awareness. The Buddha pointing out that, yes, but that big self is not a self in the sense of a soul. It's not the everlasting. You see, the Buddha was— I guess he knew, or maybe he doesn't, and I'm just assuming that he understood that the atmosphere is temporary. It needs gravity in the planet Earth, and when planet Earth and gravity are not here anymore, your atmosphere, where is it gone now? Anagami is not here anymore, okay? Everything is temporary, including the air we breathe. Yeah, in fact, even the air that we breathe, we can see sometimes the wind is blowing, sometimes it's not, sometimes it's full of smoke, sometimes things are on fire, all kinds of things that make the air itself different and changeable, and there is nothing eternal about it. And that's what we're talking about, is the word Anatta. It should have in fact not have been translated as Anatta, as no self, but it should have been translated as no soul. There's no permanent essence to water. Water can be broken apart, all right? And yet the Christians think that inside of each one of us— and they, and various ones will think that it's either physical or metaphysical or a bundle of energy or a bundle of joy, whatever it is. There's a soul that's so strong that it will survive the death and rotting away of a human body.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Now that's, that's clear.

**Speaker A:** And all we know is, is that when worms eat DNA out of human corpses, it becomes worm DNA. It does not stay that human DNA. Name. And everything that comes together falls apart. That's one of the major teachings of the Buddha. Anything that can be caused to come together will come apart when, uh, the causality changes. Or another way of talking about it is, is that every fire has a fuel, that fires are known by their fuel. You have a house fire, a grass fire, uh, gas fire, log fire. Every fire is known by its fuel. What is it? What kind of fire? I mean, even electrical fire, kind of misnamed because we know where the fire got started, but really it's the electrical equipment fire that's burning. It's not an electrical fire, folks, it's electrical equipment fire. Sorry, been an engineer here too long. But you get the point. Yeah, every fire. So what fire is it that you know of that does not have any fuel?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's nothing.

**Speaker A:** So if there was such a fire, it would have to be magical because it doesn't fit the laws of nature, right? And so, for instance, ghost— what is the fire, or what is the fuel that keeps a ghost a ghost?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there can't be.

**Speaker A:** What is the fire that fuels hell in the Christian mind? Sorry, I just gave it away. Yeah, the hell is hot only when we think it's hot. That's where the— that's where the fire is. We have to understand where the fuel comes from. And when we understand the fuel, then we recognize that a lot of the things that we have that we think are real are not real. Their fuel comes from the mind, not from reality.

**Speaker B:** That's called the three characteristics, right? Anicca, Dhammarato, and Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, I've been hitting them pretty hard and not telling you I was.

**Speaker B:** I'm familiar with that. What I would consider, I guess maybe ignorantly, like a good meditation session is when those things are very clear.

**Speaker A:** It's so important in Anapanasati that actually that's step 13, start to be aware of the rising and the falling of just everything is rising and falling, everything is just up and down and up and down and up and down, some of it is really fast, some of it is quite slow. But everything is in its own rhythm. It's Anicca. In fact, one of the polyphrases is: "Anicca vatta sankhara, upadana, arya, dhamma, tathagata, bhikkhuni, bhikkhu, arhat." Now what that last part is, the last word in it is Sukkha. And what it means is death is the highest peace. This is actually a funeral chant. Anicca is the first word of it. Anicca is the first word, and the ending word is Sukkha. This is a funeral chant. Anicca, Bhante Sankhara is actually Um, everything that can— that's the Samskara, which means a collection or a group or a compound or anything that is stuck together because of some original cause. Okay, so that you could even use the word associated. Okay, any association will fall apart. Every association will fall apart. Every water molecule is subject to falling apart into oxygen and hydrogen. Everything is subject to decay. Anicca, what to Sankhara, including every one of us. And that rotting away then is finally the peace. Once we're dead, you finally have peace. Peace or death is the highest peace, right? Yeah, you got to keep breathing. And that's a bit— when you're dead, finally we're completely at rest, completely. And that's why they call it, uh, and it's, it's a silly joke, I know, but most Westerners just don't get it. And that is the The Mahaparinibbana. That's okay. Yeah, that's which, which means, uh, um, Maha means the great one and peri means around. Okay. Okay, like paramedics are medics but they're not quite, they're almost doctors, they're around doctors.

**Speaker B:** Okay, is that really what it means?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and Parinibbana, those that are not quite there, but they hang around the legal. So, so the Maha, the great hanging around of cool, that's what Mahayana means. It means a great big cooling off. Everything cools down, not just the core, but the whole surroundings, everything's cooled off. And so that's the highest happiness, the highest peace, the highest contentment, is to be dead. Knowing that, doesn't it give you an idea, well, we've got to try that out sometime? I've got to be ready for it. In fact, I really want to be there. I want to see what's going on. Yeah, yeah, not yet though. I've got to prepare for it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I've got to practice.

**Speaker A:** You got to practice. You got a bit more practice to do. So if you can handle your last moment of death, then you can handle that last moment before before you hit your daughter? You can't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then you don't, because you're not going to go into that unwholesome, and you know it, right? Exactly. All right, so if you could do it at that moment, then you can do it even before you open your mouth. Yeah, yeah, even before you open your mouth, because it's easy for you to say, yeah, I'm not going to hit her. But now we're not even going to open the mouth. Now that's the level that we have to think about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like increasingly more subtle control, I guess. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Until you develop the skills of it.

**Speaker B:** Until it's effortless, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. That's a good skill to be able to catch your anger before you open your mouth. That's good. It's late, but it's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and we do that constantly by practicing putting wholesome thoughts in, putting wholesome thoughts in, putting— because you can already see that these anger thoughts are not wholesome. Wait a minute, I don't have to even say anything. I can check the unwholesomeness of that and chuck it right out because gotten in the habit of doing that. So that's why we practice in seclusion. We practice in seclusion so that we can get into the habit and start forming the habits of let's have wholesome thoughts, let's not allow thoughts to go into dangerous territory.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Yeah, I like again to reiterate, dangerous versus bad. It's not bad, it's just kind of a warning.

**Speaker A:** Funny how the Buddha used that word.

**Speaker B:** He didn't use that on purpose, perhaps.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's dangerous, and something will happen that you don't like, right? But it's all back to the issue of the Vedana. In fact, that's something that we can talk about at a later time, of how we feel about things determines whether things are good are bad. If I like it, then I want it. And if I like it and want it, then I think it's good, right? If I don't like it and I don't want it, then I think it's bad. And there's where goods and bad come from, not wisdom, right? Good and bad is not wisdom-oriented. Yeah, everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Would you say wisdom is more objective then?

**Speaker A:** I would say it's more— I'll use the word trajectory.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** to look at how things are headed. Yeah, look at the mind moments. This leads to this, leads to this, leads to that. And when you can begin to understand these cause-effect relationships about how things happen. That's wisdom, is to see that stuff in process so that you can whack it off someplace. You can, you can— how do you say it— uh, head it off at the pass. Yeah, yeah. All right. And so the analogy then would be at a gun, um, shooting range, everyone is very mindful of which direction every gun is pointed. You don't see Grandpa with the gun under his arm over his shoulder and he's just walking around about to blow any and everybody's kneecaps off, right? He will warn you. No, you don't hold a shotgun like that, right? Yeah. No, you don't go out in public and have that thing pointed at anybody. Okay, why is that? When hunters are out together, they make sure that you don't point your gun at anybody. You keep your gun either pointed in the air or pointed at the ground, but not at a dog.

**Speaker B:** I mean, practice is part of that, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it's partly mindful because they see how dangerous it is if the gun goes off while they're not mindful of which direction the barrel is pointed. All right. When we understand that every one of us is carrying a much bigger shotgun up here, we begin to look at which way it's pointed. So in case it goes off, it's going to go off into the wholesome rather than into something unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Is which direction is this thing headed? Is this an unwholesome kind of direction? Or— and so this is wisdom, is be able to see how things are going, see things headed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I get that. That makes a lot of sense. Trajectory. It's interesting, even just talking about

**Speaker A:** what

**Speaker B:** the practice is, is freeing in itself. It's almost like gladdening the mind just talking about it.

**Speaker A:** That's why they use words like Moksha and Viveka. That's what these words mean. Moksha, Mok. Freedom. Yeah, Wat Suwan Mok, which the word Suwan means the Garden of Liberation. Freedom. Freedom Park. Ah,

**Speaker B:** there's that language again. So fascinating.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it means Freedom Park. Uh, so the word Moksha is used commonly. Anagami in the Pali, and so is Upekkha and other things. Upekkha has more of the quality of you're about to touch something, like you're about to pick up a bunch of leaves and you recognize there's a snake right there. What do you do? How do you respond? You draw back. Yeah, you really draw back like that. That's the quality of Vivekkha.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And you can't do that if you're not aware.

**Speaker A:** If you don't see that snake, if you can't see that Dukkha, if you don't see that danger. But if you see that danger, you go— and that's exactly what we want to do. Or we want that cowherd to hit that cow. We want him to hit it. Because we can see the danger of that cow about to step on something. So these are analogies that give that quality of, you know, escape, getting away from that thing.

**Speaker B:** Is that— I've heard you use the phrase dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** Is that— that's dukkha. What that is, dukkha, Nirodha. Dukkha is being able to see that and escape from it immediately. Yeah, many people understand Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha is, oh, I've got to see Dukkha and really understand it well and live in Dukkha and really have my belly full of it. And then if I'm really, really good at Sila or something, something will happen, and then all of a sudden I can feel relief. And that's— and but that's very Western-minded. Yeah, that's Very much also in the sense of karma. If you keep doing good, eventually you'll get good results.

**Speaker B:** It's like later.

**Speaker A:** And the Buddha is not into that kind of good karma. He's into the good karma that if you do it good right now, you'll get good results right now. Don't worry about the future. If you're doing it good now, if you can bring in wholesome thoughts, you'll have the benefit of those wholesome thoughts, just like we've talked about it those 5 analogies for the hindrances. It's like getting out of jail. Isn't that good enough right now?

**Speaker B:** Isn't that good enough?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like coming home and setting our baggage down and, whoa, what a relief. I'm glad I'm not on the road. I remember years ago when I was doing it that I would get on the ferry where all the tourist high-speed catamaran and because I was going to the other island for a visa or whatever. And so I basically could carry everything I needed in a pocket, no luggage at all. And here I am with all of these people with all this luggage, and I'm marveling about this sutta that I know of Buddha, looking how much they're struggling, and they're always worried about their luggage. And even when they set all the luggage up at the the front of the boat, everybody's looking for their luggage. Is anybody going to get my luggage, you know? And you can't just set your luggage down someplace to go up to a ticket counter. No, you got to carry it with you or have a friend. So the whole issue of the luggage is really a big deal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so if you could just walk free, don't carry a bunch of baggage, not a bunch of luggage around. Luggage is hard work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you never need it, and

**Speaker A:** we don't need it. And guess how— what kind of mental luggage, mental baggage we have? It's a set of law books. That's the baggage we carry. Yeah, a set of law books.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it totally is.

**Speaker A:** Wow. A bunch of shoulds and woulds, and how's that kid supposed to act Anicca, Arahant, and all this baggage that we have of how things ought to be and how things should be, and then we turn it around and slap ourselves with the very books that we're carrying around, not matching up to our own expectations.

**Speaker B:** Right, and that's the critical mind that we talked about.

**Speaker A:** That's the critical mind that we're talking about. Yeah, that's the critical mind, is that set of law books, and we carry it around. Around, until the Buddha advises, "Hey, set all that stuff down and look at what's happening right now, and you've got all the rule-making you need. Is this suffering or is this not? Is this Sukkha or is this Dukkha?" Make that connection over and over again until you're getting very good at it, and you keep changing and choosing Sukkha, you keep choosing the wholesome. Over and over again you get into the habit of doing that, and boy, isn't that nice?

**Speaker B:** Isn't there a story? I don't know if it's the original Buddha, but someone asks him for a teaching while he's traveling, I think, and I think all he does is put down his bag and that's the whole teaching. Or he tells the other guy to put down his bag.

**Speaker A:** That sounds much more Zen than the way that the Buddhists are. That sounds very Zen. They're the ones who drop stuff or slam doors and things like that for that satori. But yeah, I can understand. I do know that there's a story in the Sutta Nipata, one of the very, very oldest books, where a guy is running from this city to that city. He's a messenger, and all along the way he says, well, why am I running so hard when I could walk? And so he slows down to a walk. And while he's walking, up ahead he sees a shade tree, and so he says, "Well, why don't I stand in the shade for a little while?" And while he's standing in that shade tree, he sees that there's a nice grassy area sitting right under the tree, and he says, "Well, why don't I sit down?" This is the spiritual journey that we're on.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Is why don't I take it easy? Why am I running when I could walk? Why am I walking when I could stand? Why am I standing when I could sit?

**Speaker B:** So is the only thing between that mindset and like craving for like, I guess like a Dhamma pleasure or something, is wisdom? Is that the thing keeping us from—

**Speaker A:** so yeah, so that town or that city that he is running to is, uh, is, let us say, pleasures of Dhamma city.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, always wanting something instead of just, this is it, relax, this is good enough, this is satisfying. Yeah, this is good enough. That's the quality that needs to be practiced so that you can continue in that, uh, this is good enough, this is fine. And then she comes in and pushes your buttons and you say, oh, this is okay, this is fine. But that takes a bit of training. It does. And then you can say, "Oh, I noticed you just pushed my button. Was that fun or what?"

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's so true.

**Speaker A:** So that's how we begin to practice. That's how we continue to practice. And we continue to practice in the direction of it gets easier and easier and easier along the path. The hardest work that we have to do is enormously pleasurable and immediate, even though there is effort involved, one's right effort. We have to take that right effort of immediately throwing hindrances out, but the more often we do it, the easier it becomes to do. And to assume we don't have to throw anything out, it's all good.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. So practice, enjoy, practice, practice on the cushion, practice on the couch, practice all alone, and practice with the grouch.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'm keeping that up here.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you, Dan. It's really good to see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Great to see you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, take care.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a Sangha friend, covers several interconnected themes, all centered on practical Buddhist practice and understanding the original teachings. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Practice & Dealing with Challenges**
*   **Morning Practice:** A student shares their routine of practicing first thing in the morning to set a positive tone for the day, manage chronic pain, and create internal space. To combat sleepiness, they practice with eyes open and use intentional deep breaths.
*   **Dealing with Anger & Family:** The student asks about managing anger and frustration, especially around family (small children). Dhammarato explains that the difficulty arises because family members know how to push our "buttons," activating unwholesome mental habits.
*   **The "Log in the Bog" Analogy:** Dhammarato uses the Buddha's analogy: a wet log in a bog cannot catch fire. You must first pull it out and let it dry. Similarly, we must first **seclude ourselves** (physically or mentally) to practice effectively. This seclusion allows us to establish wholesome thoughts without constant external triggers.
*   **Right Effort is Thought Replacement:** The essential practice is **Right Effort**: vigilantly watching the mind and **replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones**. This is the "cowherd" mind, gently guiding thoughts back to the wholesome path.
*   **Reframing "Danger":** A key shift is to see unwholesome thoughts not as "bad" but as **"dangerous"**—they lead to suffering (dukkha). Seeing the danger creates the impetus to let them go.
*   **Being Gentle with Yourself:** Dhammarato emphasizes not giving yourself undue burdens. If physical pain arises in meditation, adjust your posture mindfully. The pain of self-criticism and internal pressure ("the boss in your head") is something you can learn to quiet.

### **The Importance of Studying Pali & Original Texts**
*   **Go to the Source:** Dhammarato strongly recommends studying the **Pali language** to understand what the Buddha actually taught, as many English translations contain errors and impose magical or Christianized concepts.
*   **Example - Anapanasati Sutta:** He directs the student to the **Anapanasati Sutta (MN 118)**, calling it "fabulously dense" and worth memorizing.
*   **Problems with Translations:** Translations often:
    *   Miss the **poetic, musical quality** of Pali (e.g., the resonant "-ṃ" ending).
    *   **Make ordinary words magical** (e.g., *deva* means "celebrity" or high-status person, not a god; *brahma* refers to high quality, not a creator god).
    *   **Blur important distinctions** (e.g., *citta* is better understood as "heart" (the seat of emotion), while *mano* is the higher, intellectual mind).
*   **Resource - SuttaCentral:** He recommends **SuttaCentral.org** as a tool for line-by-line study with Pali and English side-by-side.

### **Historical Context: Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the "Noble Dhamma"**
*   Dhammarato tells the story of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**, a 20th-century Thai monk who taught the "Noble Dhamma" (the core, non-magical teachings like *anattā*) directly to the public and the Thai elite (judges, lawyers).
*   This provoked a **Sangha heresy trial (Sangha Dassesa)**, but Buddhadasa defended himself using the suttas. He had powerful allies, including his teacher, the **Sangha Supreme Patriarch (Somdet)** of Thailand.
*   This story illustrates how the profound, non-ritualistic teachings were historically preserved but often kept within educated circles ("you don't ask, we don't tell"). Buddhadasa helped spark a revival of sutta-based study.

### **Key Dhamma Concepts Explored**
*   **The Five Hindrances & Their Analogies:** Freedom from hindrances is like: 1) Recovering from sickness, 2) Being released from prison, 3) Completing service to a master, 4) Paying off a debt, 5) Safely completing a journey and setting down your baggage. All describe **relief and freedom**.
*   **Anattā (Not-Self):** This doesn't mean "no self" in a modern sense, but **"no soul"**—no permanent, eternal essence. Everything is composite and temporary (*anicca*), including what we call the "self" or "atmosphere" (spirit). Understanding this undermines the need for selfish protection and criticism.
*   **Rebirth Every Moment:** We are "reborn" in each moment based on our mental habits. The goal is to cultivate the habit of choosing wholesome states, so that at death (the final moment), the mind is in a wholesome state.
*   **Wisdom as Seeing Trajectory:** Wisdom (*paññā*) is not just being objective; it's seeing the **cause-and-effect trajectory** of thoughts. It allows you to see danger (like a snake in the grass) and "head it off at the pass" by choosing a wholesome path.

### **Conclusion & Practical Takeaway**
The talk concludes by tying practice back to daily life. The freedom (*mokkha*) practiced in seclusion must be applied "with the grouch." The ultimate practice is **continuous**: "practice on the cushion, practice on the couch, practice all alone, and practice with the grouch." The goal is to develop the effortless skill of maintaining a wholesome, gladdened mind by consistently seeing the danger in unwholesome thoughts and choosing satisfaction and ease in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers, primarily by Speaker A (Dhammarato):

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Log in the Bog:** Used to explain the need for seclusion in practice. The mind is like a wet log in a swamp; you can't set it on fire (ignite wholesome states) there. You must first pull it out (into seclusion) so the sun and air can dry it, making it ready. This illustrates that initial practice away from distractions is necessary to prepare the mind.

2.  **The Cowherd and the Cows (from Sutta 19):** The mind's thoughts are like cows being led through a village. The cowherd (the practitioner) must vigilantly keep them from straying and causing damage (unwholesome thoughts). Once in the safe pasture (a state of sustained wholesome thoughts), the watching can relax. This metaphor is for mindful thought management.

3.  **The Five Analogies for Freedom from Hindrances:** A set of metaphors describing the relief of overcoming unwholesome mental states (the Five Hindrances):
    *   **Recovering from Sickness:** The relief of getting well and leaving the hospital.
    *   **Release from Prison:** The joy of being "sprung" from confinement.
    *   **Freedom from Slavery/Service:** No longer being at the constant beck and call of a master (compared to serving a king or the demands of family).
    *   **Paying Off a Debt:** The relief of being free from financial (or karmic) burden.
    *   **Completing a Dangerous Journey:** The safety and relief of arriving home safely with all your caravan and goods intact.

4.  **The Shotgun:** The mind is compared to a loaded shotgun. Wisdom involves being constantly mindful of where it's pointed (the trajectory of your thoughts), ensuring it's aimed in a wholesome direction so if it "goes off," it doesn't cause harm.

5.  **Carrying Baggage/Law Books:** Our mental burdens—shoulds, expectations, rules, and self-criticism—are like heavy luggage or a set of law books we carry everywhere. The practice involves learning to set this baggage down.

6.  **The Noble Gases (e.g., Argon):** Used to explain the "noble" in "Noble Truths" or "noble mind." Like noble gases that don't react with other elements, a noble mind doesn't engage with or "have anything to do with" unwholesome thoughts (Mara).

7.  **Fire and Fuel:** Every fire is defined by its fuel (house fire, grass fire). The metaphor questions the fuel for supposed eternal things like a soul or hell, pointing to their dependence on mental constructs. It reinforces impermanence (*anicca*).

8.  **The Atmosphere/Spirit (for *Anatta*):** Explains "no-self" (*anatta*) by linking it to *atmos* (atmosphere, spirit). Like the atmosphere, there is no permanent, eternal essence—it's contingent and changing. This argues against a fixed soul.

9.  **The Messenger Slowing Down (from the Sutta Nipata):** A story where a messenger asks why he's running when he could walk, then why walk when he could stand in the shade, then why stand when he could sit. A metaphor for easing into the present moment and letting go of striving.

### **Stories & Historical Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the Sangha Dispute:**
    *   **The Spark:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa gave a public talk teaching advanced, "noble" Dhamma (like *anatta*) to a general audience, bypassing the conventional "beginner" teachings on morality and rebirth.
    *   **The Backlash:** This provoked a major inquiry (*Sangha Dassesa*) by senior monks in Bangkok, who accused him of heresy that could "destroy the Sangha."
    *   **The Defense & Revolution:** Buddhadasa defended himself using precise Pali scholarship, arguing for non-magical, contextual interpretations of terms (e.g., *deva* as "celebrity" or high-status person, not "god"). His correctness and his powerful, secret allies (including the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand) led to a reevaluation of the suttas among the Thai elite. The story illustrates how "secret" or reserved teachings were brought into the open.

2.  **The General McClellan Story:** A historical anecdote about the U.S. Civil War general who trained an army perfectly but was afraid to lead it into battle. This is a metaphor for being mentally prepared (having the Dhamma knowledge) but failing to act on it due to fear or hesitation in daily life.

3.  **The Ferry Passenger Observation:** A personal anecdote about watching tourists struggle with heavy luggage on a ferry, while the speaker traveled light. This story was used to viscerally connect to the Buddha's analogy of "carrying baggage" as a metaphor for mental burdens.

### **Key Conceptual Metaphors**
*   **Pali as Music/Poetry:** The repetitive case endings (-ṃ sound) give Pali a rhythmic, musical, and mantra-like quality lost in translation.
*   **Rebirth in Every Moment:** Rebirth is reframed not as a literal afterlife, but as the constant re-arising of mental states (e.g., being "reborn" in a state of anger, fear, or peace from moment to moment).
*   **Death as the Highest Peace (*Parinibbana*):** The final cooling off and rest is presented as the ultimate sukha (happiness/peace), a perspective to reduce fear and put daily irritations in context.

These metaphors and stories serve to make complex Dhamma concepts like right effort, hindrances, *anatta*, and mindfulness accessible, grounding them in vivid imagery and historical context.
