### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Boy, I think it turned your cam— oh, there you go. All right, all right. So, uh, this is your first call?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Um, I, I detect a, uh, an accent. Where do you live?

**Speaker B:** New Zealand.

**Speaker A:** New Zealand, okay. It wasn't quite an Aussie accent, but.

**Speaker B:** It'S— no, we get confused. We get mixed up between the two of us though.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Well, actually, you're the first student that I've had from New Zealand. Haven't had anyone yet. Had lots of students from Australia. Um, so you, you ask a kind of an important question about Right Noble effort. The way to easily describe it is that Right Noble Effort is the absolute least amount of effort needed to get the job done.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the absolute least amount of work needed to actually get the job done, that's Right Noble Effort. All right, so here's, here's a silly example of that. That Tom Sawyer's aunt told him he's got to whitewash the picket fence, and so he takes his bucket out there and he's grumbling, he's, um, uh, painting that, uh, uh, picket fence, and his, uh, good friend Huckleberry Finn walks by and starts a conversation. And Tom says, I'm so busy painting my fence here, I don't have time to talk with you. And that got him interested. Oh, what are you doing? He says, well, this is so much fun. Here, you want to try? And so now Tom is sitting under the tree while Huckleberry Finn is painting the aunt's white picket fence. That's right effort on Tom's part, the least amount of effort to actually get the job done. All right, so in fact, not wanting to paint the picket fence was a whole lot of work for Tom, but he started to enjoy it, and that was a whole lot less effort because he's enjoying it. And then he got his friend Huck to actually do it for him. Okay, so then he doesn't have anything to do. All right, so that means that in a way, right noble effort is to give away all the work. Okay, to let it go, to drop it. It's not important. Or if we're going to do it, do it happily. This is the right noble effort that we take when we're practicing correctly, and most don't. The reason that we don't practice right noble effort is because we want something. We're in a state of desire. And feeling, that that's in fact the only reason why anyone would ever start the practice of meditation, is because we're dissatisfied and we want something, and we know it. That people are often dissatisfied and they don't know it, but they blame whatever it is on someone else. Politicians are very good at blaming other people for things.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this whole quality of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path— in fact, the Buddha says it several times in this way, that I only teach both formally and now one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now, that can be completely liberating, just to understand that all we need to do is to have the wisdom, the insight, the ability to see the Dukkha in time to avoid it completely. And the longer we wait with it, sort of like when we're stabbed with a knife And then we give the guy a chance to grind it in. Okay, it's better to stay away from guys with knives. Yeah, it's better not to get close to a knife. It's better to resist the knife, and it's better to pull the knife out at whatever level that we're talking about here. So with the meditators, then the unwholesome thought will come, and they don't remove it. They keep thinking about it and thinking about it. Problem-solving, we call it. And the mind just twists and turns in the winds of dissatisfaction. So what right effort is then is the effort that it takes also to make a change. That in fact, you could say that the number one word— you could go actually so far as to say the entire teaching of the Buddha can be summed up in just one word, that is change. Because the dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha means you see the dukkha and then you make a change to come out of the dukkha. So this is how we're going to be practicing, is basically taking an object. And that within Western meditation, the object of meditation seems to have gotten important, especially if you're intending to dwell on the object. But actually, with Anapanasati, What object that we take is not important. What's important is that we can take an object. And we're going to be taking a whole lot of objects. OK, you could use it. The analogy would be like a ball. There's many, many different kinds of balls. But when a kid gets good at playing with one kind of ball, he can transfer that to other kinds of balls. So he can get started with a baseball or a softball, can play then with— because a lot of the whole idea of balls is the trajectory. Where are they and where will they be and where will I be when it gets there? Yeah, right. Okay. And so it doesn't really matter what the size of the ball is, from a basketball or a soccer ball or a baseball. Or even a golf ball. The qualities of the balls are the same. So the quality of the object that we're going to be taking has that quality of it's an object, but we can take the breath, we can take the body, we can take the body in the sense of where the tensions are, we can take the body in the sense of it being relaxed, we can take feelings, we can take the thoughts. In fact, we want to be able to take everything that we are as an object from time to time. And so we become skilled at moving from one object to another based upon the reality and the circumstances. So in the beginning, we talk about it. Let us say there's two different ways. One is we can approach it with the breath. And the other one we can approach it with the mind, but there in fact we're going to be doing both together anyway. To learn to control the breath, we take the breath as an object of meditation, and as we do that, we keep coming back to the breath and coming back to the breath. And then Goenka has the pet phrase that when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. Now that's the correct practice, but almost always when the mind wanders away from the breath, the students don't like it. They say, "Oh, this is a monkey mind. Oh, I must be doing something wrong. Oh, I need help. I need a new teacher," and all of these doubts and all these hindrances come up. And they're not aware that they should be taking those hindrances very quickly as an object of meditation in the sense of identifying them Recognizing that this is doubt and that all I have to do is throw that doubt out, throw that thing out, which is the right effort, and come back to the breath. And that takes very little effort unless we're clinging to the thoughts that we were having, and then it takes a whole lot of effort to set them down because we were stuck in it. Clinging. That in fact, if we can see those things like the knife flashes, we can see that and avoid the situation. But normally what winds up is that those daggers of thoughts are not only sticking all the way into the mind, they're being twisted and twisted and turned and making more and more and more damage. And those are the kind of thoughts then that are ground in, that require more effort. And so the students will say, oh well, I can stop thinking about my dad and come back to the breath, but then a minute later my dad thoughts come back up. Oh, poor me. Well, no, we're just talking about that, though, that thoughts about dad are kind of stuck in the mind. You've let them be stuck there for a long time. And that now we're becoming aware of those thoughts. So never mind, throw it out again and throw it out again. That is sort of like the students get tired of doing the right thing, and so they start doing the wrong thing again. And the right thing, because the wrong thing is just easy to do, that's what they've been doing all along. Okay, so that's the normal neural pathways of the mind, is to just think about Dad and feel bad. So the right thing to do is to recognize immediately, hey, I can think of something better. And so we do that. Um, a way of stating it then is that any thought that we have could in fact be improved if we just look at it. Any thought can be improved. But let us say hypothetically that there is a thought that comes by that is so marvelous, so magnificent, so wonderful that it couldn't possibly be improved. Well, at least then we can recognize that that's the kind of thought that we just had, and we can congratulate ourselves for that. So we in fact can improve it.

**Speaker B:** Right? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so any thought can be improved. And 'Oh, poor me, my dad's bothering me in my mind' is not a healthy, wholesome thought. The kind of thought that we'd have is, 'Never mind, I don't need that right now.' And eventually that comes to, wow, I can throw that kind of stuff right out of the mind. So we're looking for success, we're looking for satisfaction. And so the way that the Buddha talks about right noble effort is the actual right noble effort is to change the thoughts that we have from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. To change our viewpoints, to change our attitudes from unwholesome to wholesome. And that's all there is to it. That's actually easy to do. So now we're back to that point about that the right noble effort is to do the least amount of work to actually get the job done. And what is the job that we've got in front? The number one job is to remove the hindrances. Now, why do we call them hindrances? We call them hindrances because those kind of thoughts hinder us from feeling the way that we would want to feel. That our hindrances is what keeps us feeling the way that we have been feeling. We get into a habit of the way that we feel, basically from early childhood. That we go through several phases. One of them is the phase of, let us say, 2 and 3 years old, where the child is very curious, tears up his toys, makes a mess, that kind of thing. And then the next phase is when little Johnny is put to work. He's now mommy's little helper. Okay, do your homework, learn your ABCs, learn your 1-2-3s, pick up your clothes, all of that kind of stuff. And that's when the critical thinking comes in. Before that, mommy nurtured her child, that whatever he did, he got some pushtap, but normally it was okay. He's still just a tender infant. That example that I like is, is that when a newborn is born, it's only— it's generally about 2 or 3 days before they pop out their first turd, and everybody is happy. Even Grandma wants to inspect it. Okay, but when that kid, that same kid, is 16 years old and he pops one out on the floor in the front room people are going to get really critical of him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. So what used to be in early childhood quite okay for the child to do, now eventually it becomes wrong and we are criticized for it, and we feel bad when we're criticized. Okay, so we get into the habit of doing wrong, getting to the habit of being criticized, and getting the habit of feeling bad. And we carry that off into our future. That in fact, that being criticized keeps us in the position of being a victim. That every child that's born is born as a victim. Every one of us. We can't feed ourselves, we can't put on our clothes. It has never happened in history, though there's been stories, you can guarantee that it's never happened in history that the newborn baby— let us say, at that point when the doctor is holding that infant up and giving him a slap on the butt to take a deep breath— there is no baby in history has turned and looked at the doctor and says, leave me alone, stop that. No, the infants don't even have the language to do that. All they have the language for is the bellar. So we start off completely as a victim, and the way that our society raises us and treats us, we remain in that victim's mentality our whole life. And that the way that it manifests itself is in the sense of we need help. We need mommy's help to put our shoes on, we need mommy's help to put the clothes on. Now we need mommy's help to do our homework, we need mommy's help, we need help someplace. And then in fact, this is what religions are all about, is promising that you can get the help that you need, when in fact, nobody can help you. That's the real teaching of the Buddha, that in fact— an example of that would be a child who is taking piano lessons. And if he doesn't practice this week, the teacher's going to know it, right? Because she can hear the playing and the fact that he can't play the piece that was assigned to him and that kind of stuff. But sitting in the meditation hall, or in general, we do not know what's in the minds of other people. That in fact, some people are quite skilled at lying, and other people are quite skilled at running their mouth while they don't know a thing about what they're talking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we don't know what's in the mind of other people. This is in fact what the whole definition of the Second Noble Truth is really all about. The cause of our dissatisfactions come from within one's own mind— the greed, the ill will, and our delusional systems that keep that greed and ill will going and keeping us dissatisfied. What that really is pointing out is the Second Noble Truth is all about you've got to do it for yourself. You cannot get help. No one's going to do it for us. And in that regard, about the right effort that we talked about, look how many people put how much money and time and effort into getting somebody else to do it for them when they could have done it easily for themselves in the first place. Yeah, okay. Like, for instance, how many visits to the hospital and how many visits to the doctor was actually needed, actually necessary? What, about 10%?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and so, um, this is in fact what triage is all about, is those people who have something minor enough that we don't even have to let them sit in the waiting room. Maybe they'll go home before we call them. And then those who really need something, we can treat them. So, this whole idea then, that's a major form of doubt that keeps 90% of the people in the world from ever getting any real value out of the teaching of the Buddha, is that they're expecting the teacher or the guru or somebody else to do the work for them rather than them doing it themselves. So the next level of doubt is actually quite a lot of change to that right noble effort, in the sense that if you do something the very first time, it's more difficult, but if you keep practicing and keep doing it, it gets easier. That happens in the sense of Driving a car, you learn to drive a car. The first time that somebody sits in the car, there's just so much to learn and do, especially in the old days when we had automatic transmissions. So it takes a while for that 14-year-old. He may have to get up to driving that car a lot, maybe 2 or 3 years before he can actually do donuts. Yeah, right, takes some training. The first time we sit down in the car, we don't know what to do. It's hard work. We've seen Daddy do it, but doing it ourselves is quite difficult. So, repetition, doing it over and over and over again is a major quality of the teaching of the Buddha. Because why? Because what we're doing is It's very easy, it's dead easy, but we have to keep doing it over and over and over again. We have to practice. And so, instead of doing something that's very, very hard and working very hard to get it done, instead we do it very easy and do it very often with repetition. An example is someone walking into a gym cannot go to the dumbbells and put 100 kilos on each side and then lift. You can't do that. Nobody can, right? But what we can do is we can go to the gym and get a 1-kilogram dumbbell and then start doing reps. Okay, so in that regard, you could say that that 100-kilo dumbbell or barbell that the guy is trying to pick up, he's putting way too much effort and not even getting any results. In fact, he may hurt himself. That, in fact, YouTube is full of flops where people get— they're doing a jerk and then a second later that barbell is on their chest and they're flat on the floor. They couldn't hold it, they lost it, right? Yeah, that's wrong effort, right? Yeah. And it's wrong effort because we're working too hard at doing too much. So the right way to do it is very little, over and over and over again. We can see that also in the sense of the guy is carrying water bottles right now, and he's actually out here trying to pick up 6 of them at a time.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. When in fact he could pick up 3 of them, that's easy, or 4. So we try to do too much. This is what we mean then by wrong effort, is by doing too much rather than doing just what's needed to be done. So the least amount of effort would be to just pick up one bottle and move it. So go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Um, so that probably would be to do with our pre-programmed nature to strive and try hard, that type of thing, that it goes against the grain of what we actually should be doing, which is less, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That the whole teaching of the Buddha has to do with relaxation, make taking it easy, have an easy life. Don't work so hard, that in fact the people who work really, really hard is because they want a whole lot of stuff, and they have a whole lot of stuff because they have been working so hard, but they're not now enjoying all the stuff they have. They're still working hard to get more. And in fact, possibly the right thing to do for our civilization is to lower the retirement age to say 40. Yeah, but we can't do that in this society because all the rich people say, oh, I can't make so much money if all of those people retire. I'm making my money off of them, which is how the society is is based. It's based upon an exploitation model, and we exploit the children from their childhood. Oh, you're going to have to get a job. What do you want to be when you grow up, Johnny? Johnny thinks about it. He says, a lazy bum. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when we take the Eightfold Noble Path in this regard and understand that right effort, we can put that now into, well, how do we apply this right effort? And this is where the rest of the Eightfold Path comes into. The first point is the way that the Buddha describes it is actually quite correct, quite clear, that Right viewing comes first, the ability to look and to see, to recognize the Dukkha, that in fact no one calls and no one actually reads any Dhamma literature unless they already can see that there is Dukkha. We actually could see it from the beginning, we're actually smart enough. There are quite a lot of people who are in fact not. The psychotherapists for sure know, that there's a whole group of kind of people that they can't help, like sociopaths, because the sociopath is going to bring all the problems on the therapist. Oh, I paid you $300 an hour for a year and you didn't fix me. Yeah, that kind of thing. So we do recognize that there is some Dukkha. So now what we're going to do is use that knowledge and turn it into a skill. And what we're going to be doing now is to look, investigate. Now that's different. When we use this word, you've heard the word right view, right noble view, etc., like that. We also have the concept of personality view, and that the important point to recognize is that the word view in English language is used in multiple ways. And yet when we translate it out of the Pali, they're using the same word, and it gets confusing. So let's talk about two kinds of views. One's a noun and the other one's a verb. So a viewpoint, or the view on television, is all about opinions. Okay, my view of this or my view of that. And normally there is a wrong view, and that wrong view is— we could actually in modern times refer to it as progressive. The progressive view is a wrong view. Why? Because the progressive is saying we can change this society, make it better at no cost. In other words, they're saying, I can go around and harm people and get away with it, that I can get what I want, I can make the changes that I want, and other people won't suffer for it. Or if they do, I won't suffer for it because they do. Okay. And then there is the right noble— excuse me, the right ordinary view that people have. Which could be summed up into the statement of, "Oh no, you can't! You're not going to get away with it! We're going to keep things the way that they were!" You could refer to this as the conservative view, the religious view, the view of— it's kind of stated like this: "We're going to make sure that you can't get away with it! We're going to hire police, we're going to get an army, we're going to get a prison warden, we're going to get teachers, we're going to get uncles and aunts, and we're going to make sure, kid, that you don't get away with it. And if that don't work, we're going to get a priest. And so that's where all religions and everything comes from. It comes from trying to control other people. That in fact, in our society, in every society, We give children a set of rules because children are too dumb, too stupid, too not wise enough to figure out what's right and what's wrong by themselves. In fact, adults can't do that. How can we expect kids to do it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** And so we give the kids a set of guidelines, a set of rules. And then the kid picks up more rules, and more rules, and more rules, until we begin to be completely rule-bound, that the rules tell us how we should behave, and the rules tell us how we should feel, etc., like that. And so, in the practice of Anapanasati, we're actually going to stop going by the way things are supposed to be, and the way things should be. Or that kind of rule-based knowledge and system, into actually observing, actual looking. So here is where the noun of view becomes viewing, a verb. This is what Right Noble View is, and it should have been translated Right Noble Viewing or Right Noble Looking. Right noble investigation. That's what really we need to take the effort to do, is to actually stop with our conceptualized world. That in fact, what our concepts about the world are is just a worldview, and our concepts are often wrong because they were formed in the past, many of them even in childhood. And so we think we know when we don't, and we get more attached to what we think we know than what's real. And so here we're actually going to be investigating what's real. We're actually going to change that frame of reference. That's part of the right effort, is to change from thinking that we know and having views and concepts into a kind of a "don't know" attitude, a kind of investigation attitude. One story I tell is about Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, who you've no doubt heard about. And they both together decide to go to the crime scene. And there Dr. Watson is, looking around, and he's musing about the kind of people who lived in this place and that kind of thing. What does Sherlock Holmes do? He gets his magnifying glass out and he studies, he looks, he investigates. And then Dr. Watson is so surprised when Sherlock Holmes is only following the actual evidence that he's discovered, while Dr. Watson, like most detectives, try to figure it out mentally with their mind. And so that's why some investigators are so good at it and others are not. There was a television show years ago, the guy's name was Monk, and he was an investigator, but he also was an agoraphobe. He was afraid of everything, especially dirt. And because of that, his investigation of looking for the dirt wound up making him an especially excellent police detective, except that they fired him from the police force because he was so obnoxious that they didn't want to use him, but they needed him, so they'd only give him those special crimes that none of the other detectives could figure out. And, and so this is the way that, um, uh, we can, can see that it's the seeing, it's the investigating rather than the thinking that we already know. So this is actually then the Eightfold Noble Path. The next point that we can talk about, which is now becomes the star of the show, and that is Sati. Sati means to wake up, it means to remember, it means to be here now, it means to come out of our thinking process into our sensory sensory awareness to come into the present moment. And from that point, that's when we can actually do the investigation. You see, we can get lost in thought and lost in thought, and then we can wake up and say, what was I thinking?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So now we have the three things that we need together. We have Sati, to wake up, to do a look, to do an investigation, to see what's going on with discernment, and now we apply Right Effort to make a change. And that's basically the practice, is to wake up, take a look, and to make a change. To wake up, take a look, and to make a change. So what is the change quality then is going to make the thoughts wholesome. So, oh, meditation is hard. We can say, oh, I see that thought. Then in fact, meditation is actually quite easy. I just caught it. I just did it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But if I think meditation is hard and meditation is hard and meditation is hard, then that's not meditation. But meditation is hard, meditation is— ah, I see that thought. And meditation is not so hard. Okay, so this is the waking up process, is to start waking up to what we're doing and seeing it clearly. And now the effort that it takes to change is easy. Is easy to do once we understand. So if we keep doing this over and over and over again, we begin to change some feelings as well. The example that I would use is that if we examine ourselves and find that there is anxiety, fear, tension, anything that's like that, this left in the body, and many students will begin to do that, that in fact people are uptight, they don't even know that they're uptight until they sit down in meditation and then there's nothing much happening, and so that uptightness becomes manifest, they can see it, it was already there but now they can see it. Okay, now that we can see it, we can say, Well, wait a minute, there's nothing to be afraid of, there's no problems, there's no worries, there's nothing to do, I can just sit here and let that fear-based anxiety melt away. We can actually talk ourselves into feeling good. Everything is okay, everything is fine, there's no worries, there's no problems, and we keep using— in fact, you could say that that kind of language that I'm just using is very wholesome language. Meditation is easy and I love it—that's a wholesome thing. Meditation is hard and I can't do it—that's unwholesome, based upon the victim's position. You can in fact see that one of them was said by a victim and the other one is said by a champion. We're beginning to change our attitude here, so if we can get the body into, like, just in your room. You can close your eyes and be alone, going into seclusion. Don't have to go to a retreat or something special. We can just get ourselves alone, sitting down, so that we, the body, feels safe. You don't want to try to meditate in a police station or out on the highway. Those are dangerous places. We want to go to a sanctuary, a quiet place, and so that we can feel safe and secure. And in that safe and secure spot, with the body feeling that way, it's easy enough then for us to talk ourselves into feeling safe. So we use the body and we use the mind together to start working on the feelings, that we can in fact change the way that we feel. This is a major part of the training of the Buddha, especially in the Anapanasati Sutra, that we're actually going to develop the feeling of Sukkha, which by the way is exactly the opposite of the word Dukkha. Dukkha means dissatisfaction and Sukkha means being satisfied. Being in the state of pleasure, safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And so we do that with right effort over and over again. We change our dissatisfaction into satisfaction. We change our wanting the things that we don't have into, well, it's okay that I don't have it right now. I don't need it right now. I'm okay right now. And then later, when we have developed good wisdom, we don't want any things that we can't have. We're wise enough to want the things that we can have, and then we get our way every time.

**Speaker B:** So would you say it's like a certain amount of reprogramming itself?

**Speaker A:** This is exactly what we're doing. Or a better way of saying it is, is that we're actually doing some programming. That the baby, when it's born, has a certain amount of programming built into the DNA. We call this instinct, the instinct to suck. Okay, and guess what? We grow up sucking to the point that life sucks because we're not doing our sucking wisely. But we— but that's an instinct. We are born to And so, these instincts then interfere. One of the most important of the instincts is the self-preservation instinct, which gives rise to our personality view of, "This is who I am, because this is me." And that self-preservation instinct is natural. It keeps us alive. That every one of us would have been dead by the age of 20 if we didn't have any fear at all. That fear keeps us alive. Fear keeps us from jumping in the river or jumping in the fire. It prevents us from walking out into the road to chase the ball. We remember to look for traffic, that our fear keeps us alive. But there's a whole lot of false positives. We need that self-preservation instinct until wisdom kicks in, and now we don't need the instinct anymore. Why? Because with wisdom, the example of that is that the guy's walking in the city and he decides not to take the shortcut. Shortcut, because who knows why, but if he takes that shortcut, there's going to be robbers down in the— in that alley. It's better to avoid alleys, okay? Don't take those shortcuts. Stay out in the light, and then you'll be safe, okay? And so this is the way that wisdom comes in and takes over so that we don't need the instincts of fear anymore. But we also will continue to deal with the fear until we can begin, instead of— because a lot of the fear comes from criticism, critical thinking, criticizing ourselves, not up to scratch, etc. But the fear will subside if we begin to have nurturing thoughts. We nurture ourselves. Ourselves, everything's going to be okay, everything is fine. But we need to actually be in a safe and secure environment so that reality is safe and secure. And that, plus talking ourselves into feeling safe and secure, will then bring about that feeling of being safe and secure, comfortable, satisfied. So we need to practice this because we have been raised in a state of fear. That we're not just afraid of walking into the road and getting run over, we're also afraid of that big kid down the hall. We're afraid of the teacher, we're afraid of the principal, we're afraid of the cop, we become afraid of everything because we're victims of all of that stuff. Okay, so now here we are practicing these three items of the Eightfold Noble Path: right Sati to wake up, right investigation, and then making the right kind of change so that we can get ourselves into the feeling state of feeling safe, secure, and comfortable. And when those three things are well rehearsed— then a fourth item comes into play. This is the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path. Actually, it's normally listed as the second item, but it is the Pali word is Samma Sanghappa. And basically what we're talking about is an inclination or an intention or an attitude. Which direction are things leaning? An example of that is a tree is going to fall in the direction of the way that the woodsman cut it so that it would lean just a little bit in that direction, and then it's going to fall in that direction. Okay, so this is kind of a leaning of the mind, our attitude, and our attitude determines what kind of thoughts that we're going to have. Let us say that we're in a crowded environment like in the getting onto the subway, and the attitude of one person is, "This is a very dangerous place, I've got to be on great guard," and then somebody bumps into him, and he's going to turn around with great emotion. But if you have the feeling, "Oh, these guys are all my friends here," let us say that it's a group of students from a particular school that are all riding the subway together and they know each other. And so when one student bumps into another student, they know who he is. He's not going to get outraged. Okay. And so we can say that getting bumped in the freeway, in the subway, has a whole lot more to do with our attitude in the moment than it has to do with getting bumped. It's how we handle it. What's our attitude? Okay. So this is what we're beginning to change now because we're getting one success after another and after another. What is the success? Of being able to feel safe and secure, comfortable and satisfied. With that satisfaction happening over and over again, we begin to develop the attitude, "I can do this. I can do this." And then eventually We get to the point of it does not matter what kind of hindrances that come into the mind. I can clean those out. All I have to do is remember, and I can clean the mind out no matter what troubles. Okay, now this state is where the Buddha says is that when the person begins to develop the attitude that no matter what hindrances, no matter what obstructions, no matter the situation, situation that occurs, I can clean that stuff out and come back to the reality of the situation, to be in the here-now, to be in our senses, to be able to handle the situation like a champion would. Okay, the Buddha says that this state is the first knowledge on the path. The very first knowledge is the change of attitude. From the loser to the winner. And the Buddha says that this is supramundane, it's above the world. The world is having to deal with the world in our way of looking at the world, rather than having the attitude of, "Oh, I can handle this, it doesn't matter what's going on, I can handle.

**Speaker B:** It.".

**Speaker A:** So this is actually part of the path. This is the first step on the path. This is in fact noble. It's a noble way of looking at it, that I can handle anything. And this also is written that this is not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people never get that confidence. So if you remember a while ago, we were talking about the fact that people are insecure and feel that they can't do it, that they need help. Okay, so now we're at the second level. The first level we got over— nobody's going to do it for me, I'm going to have to do it myself. So now we've come up with, yes, I can do it myself. I have come over that hurdle, and so this is now the place that we've gotten to, is that I can do this. I can clean out the mind. I can see reality as it actually is, and that gives us great confidence. Saddha is the word for it, and The way to mention it so that the students really get it is, you've heard that the Buddha was known as a lion, as a bull. Okay, this is it. That attitude, that can-do attitude. I can handle anything. I can walk into and sit down into any assembly of any people. I can sit down at a PTA with a group of mothers. I can sit down in the hall with only math professors, I could sit down with the legislators, I can sit down in any group or company of people and handle my own and understand what's going on and not become afraid. I can handle anything. So this is the attitude that we're looking for, is to be able to handle anything. And this is part of the Eightfold Noble Path. A lot of people don't know that. So with this fourth thing, we begin to bring the mind together, that we're normally a crowd. We've got this conflicts with that. My mommy told me this and daddy told me that, and I don't know what to do. You know, the teacher says this and the other teachers say that. And we wind up being confused. But with this practice, we're not listening to any of those old stories that we heard. We're investigating and looking at what's real right here, right now. And so we throw out all of the old rules and see the way things are right now. In that regard, the mind now becomes unified. Is unified in reality rather than conflicted with old stories. And so this is called Samma Arya Samatha, right noble unification of mind. Here the word Samatha is used the way that it normally is. It does not mean concentration. Right noble concentration is not the way you would want to go shopping. All right, but right noble integration, you might not even want to bother to go shopping. So this is the whole quality then, is that the mind becomes unified. Here's examples of that. If the mind is unified, then we don't lie. There's no reason to lie. That we lie because we're divided, that we don't like something and so we're trying to cover it up or whatever. Also, when the mind is unified, there's no doubt. We can see clearly, and we know we can see clearly, there's no doubt about it. And so, when we are free from lies, free from want, free from doubt, when the mind is unified, then we don't want anything anymore. This is where the Sila actually comes into fruit. Now, in the beginning, we have to teach children how to live in their society because they've got no wisdom. Here we have the wisdom. So with this, we can see that I don't want anything. Why should I hurt anybody? I'm not going to hurt anybody if I don't want anything. I'm not going to steal if I don't care about it. I'm not going to lie to people if I don't care. So this is where the real Sila comes from. The real morality is coming from the fact that the mind is now unified. It's satisfied, it's content, and it's a winner. So we don't need all of that stuff. You see, mostly when we need something, that means that we feel incomplete and unwhole without it. The guy will tell the girl, I can't live without you, right? This is the mentality. And we get that attitude about that new motorbike that we want, or that new shotgun, or whatever it is We got to have it, I need it, and we cling to those things. And the reality is that we don't need them at all. What we need is to feel safe and secure. And if you feel safe and secure, then we don't need a gun. And you can see that in fact, some people collect and have hundreds and hundreds of guns, they still feel insecure. And so the guns don't help us feel secure, but practicing feeling secure will help us to learn to feel secure. And so this is the Eightfold Noble Path in brief. And this is a really, really good place to get started. Is to figure out that this is actually the teaching of the Buddha, then in fact one more kind of thing happens, and that is that once we practice to the point of recognizing that I can clean my mind out anytime, every time that I remember, and we come into the reality of the situation, because we can do that, that gives us the ability then to live our lives comfortably and happily without having to blame other people and things like that. In fact, the point that I'm making here is that we no longer have doubt about how to live our lives. The Eightfold Noble Path and the teaching of the Buddha winds up— we know beyond any shadow of any doubt that we do have and we know what is the path and what is not the path. You see, in the past we didn't know what was the path, and so therefore we found out a whole lot of stuff to try that we thought would be the path. But now we know for sure what is not the path, and that is basically everything that I've been doing before now is not the path. Yeah, but what is the path is never mind, start again, come back to the reality, clean out the mind, and be comfortable and happy right here, right now. Now, when people get that, they come back and say, well, what's next? And the answer to that is you don't have it yet, because if you actually are feeling safe and secure and comfortable, you don't have the question of what's next. What's next comes from the fact that we're just a little bit dissatisfied. Let's look at that and come back to being satisfied that this moment is okay. There is no next. This is good enough, that we're already in paradise. It doesn't need to be.

**Speaker B:** Repaired.

**Speaker A:** I see. And yet in the Western mentality, it's always more and more and more and more and more. There's no end to the the education. But here, this path has an end to it, and it ends in satisfaction, which is exactly the opposite of being dissatisfied. I mean, it's actually an easy path to take, but it's so badly misunderstood, and so many people are practicing meditation without even putting the Eightfold Noble Path into it. The Eightfold Noble Path is really, really easy to wake up into the present moment, to look at what's going on, and to make a change, and then to congratulate ourselves for making that change. And we do that over and over and over again, and we make those changes, and pretty soon we throw out all the disintegration in the mind, and the mind becomes whole. Whole and unified with the attitude, I could do this, I can handle anything, can go into any assembly, not afraid of.

**Speaker B:** Them. That's great, that's.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. And so that's all there is to it, Corey, but it needs to be practiced over and over and over again. You don't have to pick up 6 big water jugs and try to carry them around like this. Just pick up one at a time, just one at a time, one at a time. This thought, this moment, and make it really easy on yourself. This is an easy practice, but we have to keep doing it over and over and over again. Just like a water bucket, one drop at a time will eventually fill.

**Speaker B:** Up. That's excellent, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. So go practice with that mindset, and next time you call, we'll go into how we practice this with Anapanasati. In fact, I've been giving you an awful lot of Anapanasati already, but we'll put it into context next time.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. Thank you very much for that, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** That's excellent. Okay, well, when will I see you.

**Speaker B:** Again? I will try to possibly next week.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you next week then.

**Speaker B:** Fantastic. Thank you very much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** This has been a good talk. I've really enjoyed it. Great. Cory, good to have you as a new friend.

**Speaker B:** Fantastic. I'm very pleased.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings presented by Dhammarato:

### **Core Theme: Right Noble Effort and the Practical Path**
The central instruction is on **Right (or Right Noble) Effort** within the Eightfold Path, framed as a practical, accessible practice for daily life.

**1. Right Noble Effort Defined:**
*   It is **"the absolute least amount of effort needed to get the job done."**
*   It is not about striving or straining. Analogies used include:
    *   **Tom Sawyer:** Getting his fence painted by making it seem enjoyable to others, thus doing minimal work himself.
    *   **Weightlifting:** Starting with a light weight (1kg) and doing many easy reps, not trying to lift 100kg and failing.
    *   **Carrying Water:** Moving one bottle at a time easily, not struggling with six at once.

**2. The Purpose of Effort: Change.**
*   The entire Dhamma can be summed up in the word **"change."**
*   The formula is: **See Dukkha (suffering/stress) → Make a change to end it.**
*   In practice, this means changing **unwholesome thoughts and attitudes** (based on desire, ill will, victimhood) into **wholesome ones** (based on satisfaction, safety, and capability).

**3. The Core Practice Loop:**
The practical method is a simple, repeatable three-step process:
1.  **Sati (Mindfulness):** Wake up! Come out of autopilot thinking and into the present moment.
2.  **Right Investigation/Viewing:** Look clearly at what is happening in the mind and body. See thoughts, hindrances, or tension *as they are*, not through old concepts or rules.
3.  **Right Effort (Change):** Gently make a change. Drop the unwholesome thought, relax the tense body, or reassure yourself with wholesome thoughts (e.g., "I'm safe," "This is easy," "Never mind, start again").

**4. Key Insights and Frameworks:**
*   **Start from Dissatisfaction:** All practice begins because we sense *dukkha*. The Second Noble Truth points out the cause is internal (greed, ill will), meaning **we must do the work ourselves**; no one can do it for us.
*   **Reprogramming from Victim to Champion:** We are conditioned from childhood into a **victim mentality** (needing help, feeling criticized). The practice is a "reprogramming" to become a **champion** with the attitude: **"I can handle this. I can clean my mind no matter what."**
*   **The Role of Attitude (Sankappa):** Developing a "leaning" or intention of confidence and non-fear is crucial. This "can-do" attitude is the first supramundane knowledge on the path.
*   **Unification of Mind (Samadhi):** As you consistently clear unwholesome states, the mind becomes **unified, confident, and content**. From this natural integrity, true morality (*sila*) arises—you don't lie, steal, or harm because you don't feel lacking.
*   **The Goal is Satisfaction (*Sukkha*):** The path aims at feeling **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied** here and now. When truly satisfied, the question "What's next?" disappears.

**5. Practical Advice:**
*   **Make it easy:** Use minimal effort. If the mind wanders, "never mind, start again."
*   **Practice in a safe, secluded place** to help the body and mind feel secure.
*   **Use repetition, not force:** Practice the three-step loop frequently, like easy reps with a light weight.
*   **Any object is valid:** Breath, body sensations, feelings, or thoughts can all be objects of meditation. The skill is in the process of waking up, looking, and changing, not in fixating on one object.
*   **Congratulate yourself** for every successful change to build positive reinforcement.

**Conclusion:** Dhammarato presents the Eightfold Path not as a rigid doctrine but as a simple, repetitive practice of **mindful course-correction**. By constantly replacing dissatisfaction with satisfaction through minimal, wise effort, we unify the mind and transform our baseline experience from that of a struggling victim to a capable, peaceful champion. The talk ends with an invitation to apply this framework specifically to *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) in future sessions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly **Right Noble Effort** and the **Eightfold Path**. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors**

| Metaphor | What it represents |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Tom Sawyer whitewashing the fence** | Right Effort as the least effort to get the job done — Tom gets Huck to do the work while he relaxes. |
| **Being stabbed with a knife** | Letting unwholesome thoughts linger — the longer you wait, the more damage (like grinding the knife in). |
| **Playing with different balls (baseball, soccer ball, golf ball)** | Meditation objects are like different balls — skill with one transfers to others; the object itself isn’t important. |
| **Lifting weights in the gym** | Wrong effort = trying to lift too much and hurting yourself. Right effort = small, repeated, manageable effort (like lifting 1 kg many times). |
| **Carrying water bottles** | Don’t try to carry six at once; carry one at a time — effort should be minimal and sustainable. |
| **Filling a bucket drop by drop** | Practice accumulates gradually with small, consistent efforts. |
| **Tree leaning in the direction it’s cut** | Attitude/intention (Samma Sankappa) determines where the mind “falls” — leaning toward wholesome or unwholesome. |
| **Driving a car** | First time is hard, repetition makes it easy — practice makes meditation natural. |
| **Newborn baby as a victim** | We start life helpless, and society keeps us in a victim mentality — meditation helps reclaim agency. |
| **Piano lessons** | You can’t fake practice — in meditation, no one else can do the work for you. |
| **Shortcut through a dark alley** | Wisdom avoids danger; instinctual fear is replaced by wise discernment. |

---

### **2. Stories & Analogies**

| Story / Analogy | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| **Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn** | Illustrates Right Effort: Tom minimizes his effort by making the task enjoyable and getting Huck to do it. |
| **Sherlock Holmes vs. Dr. Watson** | Holmes investigates reality (right viewing); Watson theorizes (conceptual thinking) — meditation is about investigation, not preconceived views. |
| **TV detective “Monk”** | Even with quirks, close observation (mindfulness) solves problems — emphasizing investigation over assumption. |
| **Child development stages** | Early childhood behavior (like a baby’s first turd being celebrated vs. a teen doing it being criticized) shows how conditioning creates guilt and inhibition. |
| **Subway / crowded place attitude** | Your attitude determines your reaction — seeing others as friends vs. threats changes your emotional response. |
| **Gun collector feeling insecure** | External possessions (guns) don’t create security; inner feeling of safety does. |
| **Society’s exploitation model** | We’re trained to strive and consume; Right Effort is about relaxing, not overworking. |

---

### **3. Core Conceptual Metaphors**
- **Path / Way** — The Eightfold Path as a practical journey.
- **Cleaning the mind** — Removing unwholesome thoughts like clearing clutter.
- **Programming / Reprogramming** — Replacing habitual negative thoughts with wholesome ones.
- **Winner vs. Loser / Champion vs. Victim** — Shifting from a helpless mindset to one of confidence and capability.
- **Satisfaction (Sukkha) vs. Dissatisfaction (Dukkha)** — Opposite ends of a spectrum; meditation moves you from one to the other.

---

### **Summary**
The talk uses **everyday, relatable metaphors** (sports, gym, carrying water) and **classic stories** (Tom Sawyer, Sherlock Holmes) to demystify Buddhist meditation concepts. The central theme is that **Right Effort is minimal, smart effort** — not striving or forcing — and that meditation is about **waking up, investigating, and gently changing** your mental habits through repetition and a kind, observant attitude.
