### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so the first thing that I want to say in this regard is that I have been in clinical settings. I have worked at the South Carolina State Hospital, I've worked in Ypsilanti State Hospital in Michigan. I have been trained as a clinician, but I do not have a license. That in fact, in Thailand I don't even think they have such a thing as a license, and if they do, it would be in Thai language and I wouldn't be able to pass the license test because of that. However, I don't work in that context. I work in the context of the teachings of the Buddha because I am— the reason that I do is because I have found the clinical psychology context and frame of reference, all of the several frames of reference that they have, is not actually therapeutic. Okay, including all of the pills. Now, as I was about to say before we turned the video recorder on, whether you take that medication or not is not up to me to decide. You asked me, and my specific question— answer to that is, that's not my business. You can take the pills or not according to what you and your doctors decide. All right, but what I can help you with— in fact, I can't help you at all, but I can teach you how to help yourself. That's what the real teaching of the Buddha is all about, to where the clinical setting puts a lot of the responsibility on the clinician. Why? So they can get paid for it. They can call themselves doctors and walk around in a lab coat and pontificate upon all their knowledge. But the reality is that they can't help you, that only you can help you. Only you can help yourself, and the best way you can help yourself is to stop lying to yourself. You've been told a whole lot of lies and you're repeating those lies, and the reality is that you're okay. The reality is that you can be happy if you start thinking happy thoughts. And having happy thoughts is not the same as repeating diagnosis or calling your thoughts hallucinations. That in fact it's okay to have friends, even guys in a blue shirt, that's okay. No problem with that. The point though is, is can you be happy? Can you come out of your unwholesome, unhappy thoughts and start having some happy thoughts? And the first happy thought that you can start to have is, actually, I'm okay. I'm all right just the way that I am. You can learn to love yourself and accept yourself exactly the way that you are You don't need to be fixed by some medical staff. But what you need to do with that is to continue to tell yourself that you're okay, that there's not a problem, no worries, nothing to be afraid of, and that you can just relax. The work that needs to be done has already been done. When you can do that, that's the work that needs to be done. That's the right noble effort, is to stop all the stuff that you've been doing and start telling yourself that you're okay, that you can be happy. Not a worry in the world. No place to go and nothing to do. And the spring comes and the grass grows all by itself without your help and without the doctor's help. The grass grows all by itself. That's the reality. And so this is basically what we mean, is that most people don't live in reality. And when their reality doesn't match the reality of the other people who were not in reality, then they will call you crazy because your reality doesn't match their reality. But their reality is as made up as yours is. They just agree with each other.

**Speaker B:** I don't mean to be disrespectful or cut you off, but where does like certain people share realities negate the— like the big anti-big pharma— like, I don't know, like even if you want to start talking about like antipsychotics, you're really like So you're gonna go out on a limb and say not to take lithium?

**Speaker A:** I'm not coming out on a limb to say what to do about the psychology or the pharmacy or the psychopharmacology, even though I've taken courses in psychopharmacology. Gosh, that was 50, 40 years ago, 45 years ago, and they don't even give, I mean, they give people stuff now that we never heard of. Yep. Okay. And so I'm not interested in what pills you take. I'm interested in you changing your thought process.

**Speaker B:** I mean, yeah, that— I, I mean.

**Speaker A:** And the thought process that you can change is rather than do I need those pills You can have the thought of, "I'm okay whether I take the pills or not.".

**Speaker B:** So, what do you think about multivitamins?

**Speaker A:** I think that they— people who can take multivitamins can still feel bad, and people who don't take multivitamins can still feel bad.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Whether or not the multivitamins have any other kinds of effects, I'm not interested. Okay, I'm only interested in the fact that you spend a lot of time feeling bad because you tell yourself things that make you feel bad. And if you start telling your things that make you feel good, you'll start to feel good. Do you want to feel good and happy, or do you want to be miserable? That's the question. Do you want to feel happy and joyful, or do you want to feel miserable? You've been feeling miserable for a long time. I mean, you wound up in those wards because of your feeling miserable.

**Speaker B:** Um, no, it feels more like I ended up there because everyone was treating me like I was hallucinating.

**Speaker A:** But you weren't— they weren't treating you because you were happy, were they?

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, the real problem is that like my grandfather doesn't keep his cell phone on him, so I was trying to get everyone that was seeing him to like get him to call me because there was a good chance that they were seeing him or talking to him before I was. And for some reason, no one would do that. Okay, probably because I was hallucinating.

**Speaker A:** Now let's say this. All right, can you be happy whether you talk to your grandfather or not?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess I have gone on and on.

**Speaker A:** Because you couldn't talk to him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I guess you're right. I did go like 2 years without talking to him.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's not talk about Grandpa. Let's start talking about the fact that you talk yourself into feeling bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that's why I think I was having a mood problem. I didn't even realize how quickly my mind was running, or how, like, again, how heavy into magical thinking I was leaning.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, everybody in our society is into magical thinking. You were trained in magical thinking, and one of the magical things that you were taught is that you're not okay, something's wrong with you. And the reality is, is that you're actually okay. So you need to start telling yourself what's real. Well, that's a good— you're okay.

**Speaker B:** I hope.

**Speaker A:** No, not a hope. You have to recognize it. You have to tell yourself, right now I'm okay. Are you okay right now?

**Speaker B:** I have some doctor's appointments I'm waiting on because I don't know what— That's.

**Speaker A:** Off into the future. Let's talk about right now.

**Speaker B:** I am, I am okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, right now you're okay.

**Speaker B:** It feels like Saying I'm okay feels like I'm guessing that my blood test is fine.

**Speaker A:** No, you don't worry about the blood test. Whether you've got a blood test that's A or a blood test that's B, you can still be happy. Don't worry about blood tests right now before the blood test, because that's off into the future. Right now, are you okay? I mean, you got a big smile on your face. I assume that right now you're okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I mean, yes, I guess right now this is okay, as okay as I can be.

**Speaker A:** Well, isn't that good enough?

**Speaker B:** Well, it has to be.

**Speaker A:** That is, that's real. It has to be as good enough because that's.

**Speaker B:** It. That's ACT, that's Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

**Speaker A:** No, stop putting labels on it and come back to think about being okay. Are you okay right now?

**Speaker B:** Radical acceptance, yes.

**Speaker A:** Can you accept that you're okay? Can you start to tell yourself that you're okay? I know that you've been told a whole lot of stuff about how you're not okay, and that now you're telling yourself that you're not okay. And I'm inviting you to change those thoughts into the thought that right now I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That's the thing that needs to be changed, is the thoughts that you're having. And to drop all of that stuff. Drop all the clinical stuff, drop all the blood tests, drop all the vitamins, and right now you're okay.

**Speaker B:** I am okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, now see yourself as an imagination that you're opening a pill bottle and you're okay. Hi, I'm— Take the pill out of the bottle and you're okay. And then you take the pill and put it in your mouth and you're still okay. And then you take a sip of water and swallow the pill and you're still okay. Now imagine that you've got the pill bottle and you're okay, and then you sit the pill bottle back down on the table and you're still okay. You're okay whether you take the pill or not. So the pill is irrelevant. Blood tests are irrelevant. Vitamins are irrelevant. What you do is irrelevant. What you think is to think that you're okay, and you keep repeating that over and over and over again And pretty soon you'll begin to feel okay. In fact, you're already feeling a whole lot better than you were before you called.

**Speaker B:** Um, I, I, I did. I got a few very good belly laughs. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so continue to have some belly laughs. Continue to tell yourself that you're okay. That everything is all right, not a worry in the world, that that's all you need to do. The job that needs to be done has been done when you tell yourself that you're okay. When you start thinking about pills and doctors and where you're going to go and grandpas and phone calls, all of that kind of stuff, you talk yourself into being not okay. Okay, you can catch all of that stuff. You can say, never mind any of that stuff, I'm okay, I'm already all right, just the way that I am is just fine. All right, continue to have that thought, you'll be okay. And when you stop having thoughts about that you're okay and start having thoughts about all of that other stuff you become not okay.

**Speaker B:** You're not wrong.

**Speaker A:** That's why we want you to start to use the skill-building technique. In the Buddhist language, in Nepali, we call it Sati, to remember that you can change, that you can remember that you can see all of that stuff that you've been doing and put it down, set it aside, stop it, and start to tell yourself instead that you're okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Stop putting yourself down, stop telling yourself something is wrong, and start telling yourself you're all right, you're okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, I think I got a lot more out of this conversation than I even intended or meant to. And also, it's late, and I guess whether I take my meds or not, I still need to sleep. Because I have an early day tomorrow. All right, thank you.

**Speaker A:** You can finish this call and continue to feel okay, or you can forget and start up doing all the stuff that you've been doing and fall back into the state of not okay. Or we can finish this call and you can be grateful that you had the call and recognize that this is actually quite good stuff. Is to start going the way that the Buddha taught. Don't worry, be happy. Your choice. Yeah, over and over and over again. Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, don't worry about the medicine. Don't worry about the doctors. Don't worry about the Christian clinic. But in fact, many of the people who are psychologists and clinicians and all of that kind of stuff, they don't know how to be happy either. So you can actually help them. You can say, don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Uh, they usually do find me helpful. They, they call me the mayor.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can call yourself okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I'm still not understanding why I can't do that and also own my diagnosis.

**Speaker A:** But you can own your diagnosis and then you can set it down and say, with or without that diagnosis, I'm okay. Yeah, but in fact, I know friends that's got 4 or 5 or 6 diagnoses.

**Speaker B:** It's true.

**Speaker A:** And I even gave him a new diagnosis. The diagnosis that I gave him was motor mouth.

**Speaker B:** Cute, cute. I always say, right, it's not as bad as some of the people I'm inside with. Anyway, I am And you remember then.

**Speaker A:** To tell yourself that everything is all right, not a worry in the world, that you can in fact stop your worries and just be happy. You're okay. Isn't that being happy enough, that you're all right? Good enough. You don't have to be marvelous, just good enough, just okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Dhammarato. I hope you have a lovely day.

**Speaker A:** I will. I hope you have an okay day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know, you're right. You definitely will. You'll— for you, it's easy. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so if you forget that you're okay, give me a call and we'll talk about being okay again.

**Speaker B:** All right, sounds good. I'll hold you to that. You have a good day.

**Speaker A:** Don't worry, be happy. You're not happy, you call me, I make you happy. That's a line out of a song, by the way.

**Speaker B:** Crawl towards your goal with happiness.

**Speaker A:** The goal is to stop all your frustrations and worries. The goal is to come out of your disappointments, dissatisfactions, and be all right, be okay, be satisfied with your life. That's the goal. Just be satisfied things are okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely. Even in spite of a to-do list.

**Speaker A:** What? In spite of all of that stuff, you're still okay?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Can you be satisfied that you're okay? No place to go and nothing to do, and whatever happens You're okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will be definitely trying to pretend like I have no obligations until they actually come.

**Speaker A:** And when you're doing those obligations, you're still okay. And when you're not doing the obligations, you're still okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'll try extra hard, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Don't have to try hard, just be okay. You don't have to try. Just be okay. You're all right. Have the thought over and over and over again: I'm all right, I'm okay. That's the change to make, is to start having wholesome, happy thoughts, one happy thought after another.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe like that.

**Speaker A:** And then you keep coming back with unwholesome stuff. Like, "I'll try harder," or, "I've got obligations." And right now you don't have any obligations other than to just be okay. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Well, and also sleeping, so I will.

**Speaker A:** Go— Well, you don't have to do that. You can lay in bed and giggle with laughter, "Oh ho, I'm okay." Sleep is not necessary. What's necessary is that you have thoughts that you're okay. You've been having sleep every night and that didn't stop your disappointments.

**Speaker B:** Not sleeping— well, yeah, you're right, it was 6 hours a day.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, if you keep telling yourself while you're in bed that you're okay, tomorrow will take care of itself because tomorrow I'll be okay. Then you can go to sleep happily. But if you start worrying about what happens tomorrow, guess what? You're worried again, you're disappointed again, you're uptight again. So don't worry about tomorrow. Wow, you can feel okay too. So go to bed having the thoughts everything is okay. Wow, what a relief it is. Everything is all right. And keep having those thoughts one after another. You're all right. You're okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's some next level radical acceptance. I'm gonna have to sit on that for at least 10 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you don't have to sit on it. You can say, hey, I don't have to have radical acceptance. I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** First we have to integrate the idea of Why?

**Speaker A:** That's what I'm inviting you to do, is to integrate the idea that you're okay. Keep telling yourself you're okay. You don't have to think about integrating any ideas. You can have the thought instead: I'm all right, I'm okay. I don't have to integrate anything. I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I don't know, it sounds like I'm gonna end up sounding like Bhante, but I'll trust you.

**Speaker A:** You're okay. That's all I need to hear is that you're okay.

**Speaker B:** I'm okay.

**Speaker A:** You're resistant to that, and stop being resistant to it and just say, wow, I am okay already. I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is that you're already okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right, see you later. Yeah, you have a good night.

**Speaker A:** Don't worry, you're already.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on a core Buddhist principle applied to mental distress: **the power of thought to create one's reality and the direct path to well-being through self-acceptance.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. Critique of Clinical Frameworks:** Dhammarato, who has clinical training but does not work as a licensed therapist, argues that clinical psychology and medication often fail to be truly therapeutic. He shifts responsibility from the "expert" clinician back to the individual, stating that only you can help yourself.

**2. The Core Teaching: "You Are Okay":** The central instruction is to repeatedly and deliberately replace negative, self-critical, or anxious thoughts with the simple thought: **"I am okay right now."** Happiness, he teaches, comes from stopping the internal narrative of being broken or needing to be "fixed" by an external authority.

**3. De-emphasizing Diagnosis and Medication:** While explicitly *not* telling anyone to stop medication (leaving that to individuals and their doctors), Dhammarato repeatedly asserts that pills, diagnoses, blood tests, and vitamins are ultimately **irrelevant** to the fundamental work of changing one's thought process. Well-being is possible whether you take them or not.

**4. Staying in the Present Moment:** He consistently guides Speaker B away from worries about the future (doctor's appointments, obligations) or the past, and back to assessing their state **right now**. The repeated question is, "Are you okay *right now*?"

**5. The Mechanism of Change:** The practice is a form of mental training (*sati*, or mindfulness):
*   **Notice** when you are telling yourself stories that make you feel bad (about diagnoses, grandpas, obligations).
*   **Stop/Drop** that train of thought.
*   **Replace** it with the wholesome, happy thought: "I am okay. Everything is all right."
*   **Repeat** this over and over to build a new habit of mind.

**6. The Goal is Simple Satisfaction:** The ultimate goal is not a complex achievement but a simple, abiding satisfaction. It's to "be all right, be okay, be satisfied with your life... No place to go and nothing to do."

**Dynamic of the Talk:** The conversation is a real-time demonstration of this method. Speaker B repeatedly brings up clinical concerns (antipsychotics, lithium, diagnosis, hallucinations), and Dhammarato gently but persistently redirects each one back to the core practice: choosing the thought "I am okay" in the present moment, irrespective of those circumstances.

**In essence,** the talk advocates for a radical shift in identity—from a patient with a problem to be managed, to a person who is fundamentally *okay* and can access happiness by letting go of worry and choosing self-accepting thoughts in the here and now. The closing refrain encapsulates it: **"Don't worry, be happy."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, Speaker A (the teacher/counselor) uses several key **metaphors** and **stories** to convey his perspective on mental well-being and self-acceptance. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"The grass grows all by itself."**
    *   **Meaning:** This is the central metaphor of the talk. It suggests that well-being and happiness are natural states that emerge when we stop interfering with our minds through worry, self-criticism, and frantic effort. Just as grass grows without force, peace and "okay-ness" arise when we stop the mental struggle. It directly contrasts with the clinical model of "fixing" a problem.

2.  **Mental activity as a story or narrative.**
    *   **Meaning:** Speaker A repeatedly frames the listener's distress as a story they are telling themselves ("you talk yourself into feeling bad," "you've been told a whole lot of lies and you're repeating those lies"). The path to wellness is to change this internal narrative to a new, simpler story: "I am okay."

3.  **Pills/Objects as irrelevant props.**
    *   **Meaning:** In the guided visualization, Speaker A uses the **metaphor of the pill bottle** as a prop in a mental play. Whether you take the pill or not in the imagination, the outcome is the same: "you're okay." This dramatizes the idea that the power lies not in the object or action, but in the foundational thought you hold about yourself.

4.  **"Don't worry, be happy."**
    *   **Meaning:** While this is a lyric from a song (which he acknowledges), he uses it as a **metaphorical instruction** for the entire approach. It encapsulates the choice to drop the complex "worry" stories (diagnoses, obligations, past, future) and adopt the simple "happy" story of present-moment acceptance.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Conflicting Realities.**
    *   **Content:** He tells a brief story about how people operate in made-up realities. When someone's personal reality doesn't match the agreed-upon reality of others (who are also in a made-up reality), they get labeled "crazy." This story reframes psychiatric diagnosis not as an objective truth, but as a clash of subjective narratives.

2.  **The Anecdote from Clinical Experience.**
    *   **Content:** He opens with a brief personal story about working in state hospitals and being trained as a clinician. This establishes his credibility to critique the system. The story leads to his conclusion that the clinical framework is "not actually therapeutic" because it places responsibility (and authority) on the doctor instead of the individual.

3.  **The Story of the Friend with Multiple Diagnoses.**
    *   **Content:** To counter the listener's fixation on diagnosis, he offers a short, humorous anecdote: "I know friends that's got 4 or 5 or 6 diagnoses... I even gave him a new diagnosis. The diagnosis that I gave him was motor mouth." This story minimizes the importance of clinical labels, suggesting they are arbitrary and less meaningful than observable, human traits.

4.  **The Guided Story/Visualization.**
    *   **Content:** He crafts a mini-story for the listener to imagine: the process of opening a pill bottle, taking a pill, swallowing it, or setting it down. At each step, the narrative repeats, "and you're okay." This is a **therapeutic story** designed to create a new mental script that decouples the listener's sense of self-worth and safety from their medical choices.

**Overall Narrative Arc:** The talk itself is a **meta-story**—a demonstration of the very process Speaker A advocates. The listener (Speaker B) comes in with stories of diagnosis, obligation, and worry. Throughout the conversation, Speaker A persistently redirects him back to the simplest possible story: **"Right now, I am okay."** The entire dialogue is a story about replacing a complex, painful narrative with a simple, liberating one.
