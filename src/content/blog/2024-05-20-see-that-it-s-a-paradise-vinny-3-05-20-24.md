### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so just constantly say, okay, I see you, thank you, off you go, and that's enough.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad I caught it. I'm glad I can see those unwholesome thoughts, because then I have a choice to change them.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** So don't fuss at yourself because you didn't have a wholesome thought. Yeah, congratulate yourself for seeing that you can see the unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Wow, I never thought to do it like that. And you're so right, because there are a lot of times now that I am actually catching unwholesome thoughts and going, okay, well, I don't need you. And now to be able to congratulate myself, I guess that's a pat on the back for yourself, and it kind of helps you to feel good about yourself in another way, right?

**Speaker B:** You have to talk yourself into it. You have to brighten your mind. Vinaya, you have been a victim your whole life. You were started as a victim, you were raised as a victim, and you become victimized in And now it's time for you to stop victimizing yourself over and over again with those unwholesome thoughts and start seeing yourself as a winner, someone that can handle things. You handle anything. Handle your wife, handle your paraplegic roommate, handle your bad teeth. You can handle anything. You're a big, tough, strong guy. You can do it.

**Speaker A:** Awesome. Thank you, Arhat. Thank you, thank you, thank you. That's great, that's good, good. Okay, now it's so much clearer. It's always good to touch base with you and get the proper perspective of how to do it rather than just the video over and over and over.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's an important point. In fact, one of the little jokes that I have is that the entire Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is on the back of a shampoo bottle. Not a special one, but every shampoo bottle that's in 7-Eleven, in the grocery store, and Tesco, and Safeway, in Tesco. Every one of them, all those bottles have the entire teaching of the Buddha on the back of the bottle.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** Do you know what it says? No. Rinse and repeat. Ah, wow. Rinse and repeat. That's all you have to do. That's the entire teaching of the Buddha. Rinse and repeat.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** All right, throw that Dukkha out and then throw it out again and clean it out and then clean it again.

**Speaker A:** Wow, okay. Is there also manifesting of good thoughts? Is that what it is, or is it just like you say, just observe, don't get too carried away, just go, wow?

**Speaker B:** So here's one of the secrets, is that we are not lying to ourselves in the sense of, oh, I feel bad, and I tell myself I feel good, but I really feel bad, right? So in fact, telling yourself you feel good is a lie. But that's not true. The reality is, is that you are okay, that you are fine, and you're the one who were telling yourself the lies when you say that you're not okay.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** All right, so this is not an affirmation, this is not pie in the sky, this is not the teenage girl looking in the mirror and telling herself she's beautiful but she knows she's not. You don't have to tell yourself that you're wonderful and beautiful and special and all of that. All you need to do is say you're okay. The girl in the mirror doesn't need to tell herself she's beautiful. She needs to say, I'm all right, I'm okay, the way I look is okay, everything's fine. Yeah, wow, everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the reality of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, it is so true. It is. And then that's what I'm really working on, is like you say, just telling myself everything's fine, everything's okay, I'm fine, I'm safe right now, there's nothing else but right now. And, uh, if you feel good right.

**Speaker B:** Now, now after now after now, you'll pretty soon be feeling good a lot of nows.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I'm really looking forward to, really.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point about rinse and repeat. Rinse out all the garbage, rinse out all the lies that you're okay, empty all of that stuff out, and what you've got left is not much, and that's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, and that's right. We don't need much, do we? We just need to have a good.

**Speaker B:** Thought and just have a good time. You have a good thought, just enjoy our life. It's good enough. You're already in paradise. Phuket's a paradise. I know that the tourists and the Thai people alike have tried to destroy that paradise of Phuket, and they've all failed at it. It's still a paradise.

**Speaker A:** No, that's right, exactly right. Everything's a paradise if you make it a paradise, isn't it, as well?

**Speaker B:** No, everything's a paradise. All you have to do to see that it's a paradise. You don't have to make anything. It's already a paradise. The reality is that it's a paradise. Beautiful beaches, beautiful weather, beautiful Thai girls. Everything is beautiful. It's already a paradise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good point, good point, good point. Oh, that's fantastic. Now, John, thanks, Dhammarato. I appreciate your time. And, uh, that you pick up to talk to us, your students. I really appreciate it. I'm hoping to try and get over your way in the school holidays. My daughter's got holidays in July and August, so I'd like to try and get over. Is Koh Phangan rainy season then, like Phuket?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's all the same, isn't it? They're close enough. I mean, it's just a car ride away. Now, in India, the monsoon comes earlier, but in the time of monsoon in Thailand is October, then it gets really heavy rain in November, but by the end of the year it's okay. Maybe it runs into the middle of January.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But the rainy season is most heavy in November.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Well, we're starting to get the rains now here in Phuket the last couple of days, so yeah, it's been raining.

**Speaker B:** I love it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, me too, me too. I It's funny how people, uh, they project misery and sadness to the rain and that, but I actually really enjoy it. It's just comforting. It's a nice feeling. Nice.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And it cleans the air and cleans the streets.

**Speaker B:** Everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, it's fantastic. That's right.

**Speaker B:** What kind of paradise would it be if it didn't rain in paradise?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah, it would be.

**Speaker B:** That's a kind of a paradise. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Ah, good, good, good. All right, Arhat, well, thank you so much again for your time, and I appreciate you answering my question, and I will keep working at your teachings, and hopefully sooner rather than the latter, everything's going to be all right. Everything's fine right now, and that's all that counts.

**Speaker B:** That's right. You keep telling yourself that over and over and over again. Rinse and repeat. Rinse all of that, 'Oh, it's hard,' or 'Life is tough,' or 'Life's not good enough.' All of them kind of thoughts. 'We're not getting along.' Throw that thought out. Yeah, you're getting along just fine. Yeah, go tell her how much you care for her.

**Speaker A:** She'll probably go, 'You're full of shit.' She'll turn around and slap me and go, 'Stop lying, you're full of it.'.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's because you haven't said it enough and she doesn't believe it yet. Yeah, don't let her hit you a dozen times and then it'll start to sink in that you really do care for her.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, that's a good point. I appreciate that. Thank you, Arjan. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Go tell her that everything is okay and you're really happy that you've got her as a friend and companion.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true. She's a good mom, so I appreciate that. So thank you, thank you, thank you. Good good to be reminded, um, of that. And happy— I'm happy right now. Everything's good right now. It's great. So I'm happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're a whole lot better off right now than you were when you called.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. That's right. So you're— like I say, it's— I, I have days where I get on medication to keep my mind clear, uh, help me.

**Speaker B:** Medications don't make your mind clearer. Having happy thoughts is what makes your mind clear.

**Speaker A:** That's so true.

**Speaker B:** So when you're ready to take that pill, say, hey, I've got a better pill. Yeah, I've got a better one. And that is just to sit and take a deep breath and say everything's okay. Tell yourself that again, and then the thought of the pill will come up a third time, and then you'll say, never mind, I'm— I am okay. I don't need the pill right now.

**Speaker A:** No, that's right. No, that's the goal. That's fantastic.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Thank you for your wise words, as always.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Have a lovely afternoon. Thanks, Ajahn Dhammarato. Thank you, thank you.

**Speaker B:** You go keep that smile on your face. Go get your daughter with a smile. Drive with a smile. Greet your wife with a smile.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I will today. Thank you, thanks for the advice. Thanks, Ajahn. Thank you. Talk soon. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), focuses on a practical and uplifting approach to meditation and daily mindfulness. Here is a summary of the core teachings:

**Core Theme:** Transforming your relationship with thoughts and perceptions to realize that "everything is okay" in the present moment.

**Key Teachings:**

1.  **"Rinse and Repeat" – The Essence of Practice:** The entire Buddhist path is humorously compared to the instructions on a shampoo bottle: **"Rinse and repeat."** This means continually noticing unwholesome or negative thoughts ("Dukkha"), letting them go ("rinsing" them out), and repeating this process patiently. It's a simple, persistent cleansing of the mind.

2.  **Change the Frame: From Victim to Observer/Winner:** A major shift is encouraged. Instead of identifying with or fighting unwholesome thoughts, the practice is to:
    *   **Catch them:** "I see you."
    *   **Acknowledge them without fuss:** "Thank you" (for showing me what's present).
    *   **Let them go:** "Off you go."
    *   **Congratulate yourself:** The victory isn't in having only wholesome thoughts, but in **seeing the unwholesome ones clearly**. This builds the skill of choice and breaks the lifelong habit of self-victimization.

3.  **"Everything is Okay" – The Fundamental Truth:** This is the central "pill" or affirmation. The teaching clarifies that this is **not a naive self-help lie** (like telling yourself you feel great when you don't). Instead, it's a correction of a deeper lie: the story that you are *not* okay. The fundamental reality, when you strip away the complaining thoughts, is that in this present moment, you are safe, fine, and capable. You "can handle anything."

4.  **Paradise is a Perception:** The external world (e.g., Phuket) is already a paradise. Suffering comes from our failure to **see** it as such, not from a need to *make* it perfect. Even rain is reframed as a beautiful, cleansing part of paradise.

5.  **Practical Application in Life:**
    *   **Replace Medication with Mindfulness:** When an urge for a pill (or any crutch) arises, use it as a cue to "rinse and repeat"—take a breath, affirm "everything is okay," and watch the craving pass.
    *   **Improve Relationships:** Express care and appreciation consistently ("rinse and repeat" the good intentions), even if met with initial skepticism.
    *   **Embody the Practice:** Keep a smile, drive with a smile, greet loved ones with a smile. This embodies the internal state of "okayness."

**Overall Tone:** The talk is encouraging, direct, and demystifying. It frames the Dhamma not as a complex philosophy, but as a **repetitive, practical mental hygiene** that builds the habit of choosing a peaceful, appreciative perspective over one of lack, complaint, and self-victimization. The goal is to feel good "now after now after now" until well-being becomes the default.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the talk uses several key metaphors and one extended analogy/story. Here is a breakdown:

### 1. The "Rinse and Repeat" Metaphor (Extended Analogy)
This is the central and most developed metaphor in the talk.
*   **Source:** The instructions on the back of a shampoo bottle.
*   **Meaning:** Speaker B jokes that the entire teaching of the Buddha is encapsulated in the phrase **"Rinse and repeat."**
*   **Application:** It's used as a practical, simple instruction for mental hygiene.
    *   **Rinse:** Acknowledge and let go of unwholesome thoughts (the "garbage," "lies," or *dukkha*—suffering/stress).
    *   **Repeat:** Do it consistently, over and over, every time an unwholesome thought arises. It emphasizes persistence and a non-judgmental process of cleansing the mind.

### 2. The "Victim" vs. "Winner/Handler" Story
This is a narrative reframing of Speaker A's self-identity.
*   **The Old Story:** Speaker B states that Vinaya (Speaker A) has lived a "victim" narrative his whole life—born into it, raised in it, and continuing to victimize himself with his thoughts.
*   **The New Story:** Speaker B urges him to rewrite his story to that of a **"winner"** and a **"big, tough, strong guy"** who **"can handle anything."** The proof offered is a list of real challenges he already handles (his wife, paraplegic roommate, bad teeth). This story is meant to shift his self-perception from passive sufferer to capable agent.

### 3. The "Pill" Metaphor
This is a comparative metaphor.
*   **The Medication Pill:** Represents a chemical, external solution to mental distress.
*   **The "Better Pill":** Represents the internal, mental practice of taking a deep breath and telling oneself **"everything's okay."** The metaphor argues that the mindful thought is a more effective and direct tool for creating mental clarity than medication.

### 4. The "Girl in the Mirror" Story/Analogy
This is a clarifying story to distinguish the teaching from naive positive thinking.
*   **The Scenario:** A teenage girl looking in the mirror, telling herself she's beautiful while secretly believing she's not.
*   **The Point:** This represents a futile **"affirmation"** or **"pie in the sky"** lie. The speaker contrasts this with the proposed practice. The girl doesn't need to lie and say she's "beautiful"; she just needs to see the truth that she is **"okay," "all right,"** and **"fine"** as she is. The story emphasizes **accepting reality** versus **imposing a fantasy**.

### 5. The "Paradise" Metaphor
This metaphor is used to reframe perception of one's current environment.
*   **The Statement:** "You're already in paradise."
*   **Application:** Speaker B uses Phuket (where Speaker A is) as a literal example—despite human attempts to spoil it, its inherent nature (beaches, weather, people) remains paradisiacal. The deeper meaning is that **reality itself is already "paradise"** if one cleanses the mind of the thoughts that obscure that fact. One doesn't *make* it a paradise; one simply has to **"see that it's a paradise."** The rain is later included as a necessary, beautiful part of this paradise.

**In summary,** the talk uses the **"Rinse and Repeat"** metaphor as the core practice. This practice is supported by shifting one's personal story from **Victim to Handler**, choosing the **"better pill"** of mindful thought over medication, avoiding the **"girl in the mirror"** trap of empty affirmations, and learning to see the **"Paradise"** that already exists in the present moment.
