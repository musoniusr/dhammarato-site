### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Done the full course of meditation, or specifically all the Jhanas under Pa Auk Sayadaw. That's the one, Pa Auk Sayadaw. And he seemed to be very keen on things like Vajrayana bodies and so on. He had a stroke and he found himself, he thought that he was in his mudra body, which is some other body other than his body body. And it's, you know, it's obviously we're getting into Tibetan stuff here with mudra bodies. But I just wonder, I mean, I would say that if you have a sensation like that, you can interpret, well, you have sensations which you can interpret in all sorts of ways. And if you have been taught about Vajrayana bodies, you may well interpret your feeling in that sort of a way.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. Exactly. That's an important point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is that we speak in a language that we have heard before. In order to describe things that we've never experienced before.

**Speaker A:** Right. I mean, I could say that I have a sensation sometimes of a kind of golden light inside the head or something. Now, I mean, I don't know what that is.

**Speaker B:** It's called imagination.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can no doubt find stuff where people will have written about that and said that it's the Absolute or the Godhead or who knows what.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** What are you going to do with this sort of stuff?

**Speaker B:** Those are events. Okay, they're happenings, they're experiences, they're not lifestyle.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So, I mean, so much of this business that you get in all religions is that people have these events which they say are self-validating. And of course, they are self-validating.

**Speaker B:** That's because they've got no real validation. They're all experiential.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. But then, of course, they describe it and people latch on to it.

**Speaker B:** Of course they do. Everybody's looking for something special. How in the world can we get people back to the point that they're happy with what they've got, which is ordinary?

**Speaker A:** I don't know. I don't know. I mean, what I have, what I am, well, I don't want to start talking about myself particularly, but I did have a feeling that I had quite.

**Speaker B:** An.

**Speaker A:** I felt that I could give myself permission rather more than before to enter into and stay in the first Jhana. There's always, I've always had rather a sense that this is something that one has to be very careful of because, you know, the Buddha goes on about assuming that the Buddha did, because we're all dealing with stuff 2,500 years old, and you never know how much is original and how much is stuff that's crept in.

**Speaker B:** But actually, we're beginning to discover that. We fairly well know what's really old. We do know that the Majjhima Nikaya was done right after his death. We've fairly established that the Dhamma Nikaya was done about 150 years later, during the time, the height of the Arahant And we do know that a lot of the literature during the Asoka era was collected together to take it to Sri Lanka. And we've also begun to figure out that because of that collection from a wide variety of places all over India, many of the suttas are actually written in different language dialects.

**Speaker A:** Is that right?

**Speaker B:** And so when you have suttas and you're translating them out of the Pali, what you're actually doing is translating out of more than one dialect. Now, the framework of that dialect was called Mahagati, but we can also fairly well establish that things like commentaries and Abhidhamma— yes, and later books like Visuddhimagga and Pancitibhagga Those books were done 1,000 years or 500, 600 years after the time of the Buddha and therefore can be deemed unreliable. And that's where you're going to find most of the magic. Yes, much later stuff. But you'll also find magical stuff in the Majjhima Nikaya too. And the possibility is that's been dicked with. The question is, when was it dicked with? Was it dicked with during the soak period? Was it dicked with as it was being done?

**Speaker C:** Do you have an example, Dhammarato?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** Do you have an example? An example?

**Speaker B:** Okay, yes, an example would be Majjhima Nikaya number 20, where the Buddha talks a lot about rebirth, and it appears that he is talking magic, but it's possible that he's actually talking metaphorically, and everybody in the hall knows that he's He's speaking metaphorically because at the end of the sutta, it specifically says, therefore do not get reborn, as if everybody had a choice about it. Well, guess what? We do. Ah.

**Speaker C:** I see. That makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Now, the choices that we have about being reborn are in fact two areas. One of the areas is if you take rebirth moment by moment and understand that all you have to do to not get reborn is just don't go there, don't have those kind of unwholesome thoughts, stay in wholesome thoughts, and you will not be reborn in those woeful states of hell or an animal or a preta. Anagami or an Asura, because you don't go there. Now also, it's been said many places by a number of different monks that I'm not coming back. Now that can be said in one of two ways, and the way that it appears that they're saying it is, is that I know enough about reality, including who's come back, who has not come back, what conditions they do come back if they do come back, etc., like that, that I feel safe and secure, I ain't coming back. Now what that actually means is then, is that they don't believe that they were ever going to come back, but now they have that confidence that they're not coming back, rather than the mystery.

**Speaker A:** So effectively, they're confident that when they're dead, they're going to be dead. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that's nice enough. Being dead is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Well, if it's good enough, you see, this is the trouble. I mean, the whole of humanity seems to want to have, seems to have what Raisin Tree calls an immortality project.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's the living who are dissatisfied with the possibility of death, just like the teenager does not want to go to college because he's never been there. Or the teenager does not want to go into the army because he's never been there, and all he's heard is bad stories. Well, you see, you're coming from a different age group. Remember, I'm talking about a teenager, okay? So that's the point, is that it's the fear of the unknown. And yet all of those stories, but no evidence.

**Speaker A:** Indeed, indeed.

**Speaker B:** Is there any evidence of Christian heaven or hell? Is there any evidence of Islamic heaven or hell? Is there any evidence of Hindus' heavens, hells, being reborn as an animal, being reborn as a human? What we have is stories.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, but most of evidence is stories. You go into a court.

**Speaker B:** And that's what you hear. Absolutely. And the whole teaching and the whole practice of the Buddha is stop with the stories about events and the stories about experiences and let's stay with reality. Because reality, when you discover it, winds up being okay, good enough. And so the dead who are dead, they don't complain about being dead. It's only the living who complain about being dead or dying. When someone dies, it's the living who complain about it, not the dead one. Many people are ready to go.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, why euthanasia exists is because people are ready to go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so being ready to go should be part of your practice.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** So that when the time comes and it's time to go, hey, I'm, you know, my train has arrived, I'm climbing on board. Happily. I'm not going to be put on that train kicking and screaming and wanting something to be different. I don't want to go, I don't want to go. Now, this is in part due to the self-preservation instinct, of course, and instinctively we don't want to die. That's part of what keeps us alive. That's what keeps a child from running in the road just at the wrong time, but it doesn't keep all kids from running in the road road. Some of them get run over because they're not watching where they're going. So that happens on all occasions. But now we're coming back to that Sutra Number 20 to figure out that, wait a minute, we've got choices here. And I would choose not to be reborn. I also leave the possibility that maybe there is something that's going to forcibly make me be reborn. I don't know what's after it. As nobody ever given a definitive answer. Not one dead person has ever published a book on death. All they ever do is living people publish books on dying.

**Speaker A:** Indeed, indeed. Well, of course, that's a big Tibetan thing, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** With the— it is Tibetan, but it's not Buddhist. Remember, the Tibetan Book of the Dead is an old, old, old book. That was where the Bardo comes in. Yeah, that's where the Bardo comes in. And all of that happened before Buddhism came to Tibet.

**Speaker A:** Is that right? Now, that's something I didn't realize. Yeah. But I mean, what they seem to— well, I mean, the way I would look at that is that they've got instances, presumably, of people who And well, they do have people who have near-death experiences. We know that that's— that's— that's a lot of that's getting written up nowadays.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's an important point that it's an experience going on, an experience.

**Speaker A:** And they're not— when they recount the experience, they're not dead.

**Speaker B:** Exactly right. But that experience did not happen in reality. That experience happened in the mind.

**Speaker A:** Anicca, Arahant.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, one of the things about it where people have been talking about, I floated up out of my body. And so a number of doctors— for this happened for years— a number of doctors would have great big signs, neon signs, light, brightly lit signs that were placed on top of shelving in the operating theater. So that if somebody did have an out-of-body experience and rose above to see what was happening, they should have seen that sign. And nobody ever sees the signs. All they have is the feeling of floating. And feeling of floating is not actually out-of-the-body floating. It's a feeling. It's an experience. And 99% of all— go ahead.

**Speaker A:** The interesting part of it seems to be the question of, you know, once your vital signs stop, is there anything else still going on in the nervous system that isn't being detected at the level we can detect at the moment?

**Speaker B:** That's an important question. And in fact, that's the point is, yeah. 100 years ago, they would detect death by holding a mirror under the nose.

**Speaker A:** That's right.

**Speaker B:** And if somebody was dead, they stopped putting smog on the mirror, except that you can get the mirror warming up his body temperature, and then somebody breathing doesn't put smog on the mirror.

**Speaker A:** Well, they know about that. I mean, they knew about that.

**Speaker B:** They didn't know about that 150 years ago, though.

**Speaker A:** Well, they did, because you got condensation. Everybody knows about condensation. You may not know that it is condensation, but it's an experience, you know, it's a common experience.

**Speaker B:** It's a modern scientific knowledge. But in the old days, they weren't relying upon scientific knowledge.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you get condensation in a house because if it's cold outside and you've got glass, you've got condensation on glass. And they had glass back in the— yeah, way back when, right? It wasn't really good glass, but they had glass. And if it was— if you were warm and wet in a room, as humans are, you know, okay.

**Speaker B:** But here's the point. If they knew 150 years ago that holding a mirror or a piece of glass under the nose of someone who they were testing to see was dead or not, they would have known then it was not reliable. But people got buried left, right, and center because they weren't breathing enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they would have known that's right enough if they knew that the warm— a warm mirror does not condense, then As you do by observation. You don't need science for it, you just need observation, right?

**Speaker B:** And a whole lot of people are still too busy feeling and not looking and investigating, observing. Okay, do you know that in fact during that era that they actually sold coffins with mechanisms on them so that the person who was buried in the coffin could ring a bell?

**Speaker A:** I have read of that.

**Speaker B:** All right, which means that the methods of testing whether someone was dead or not was unreliable.

**Speaker C:** Oh, this happened recently in India. There was a woman who was about to be cremated and then she opened her eyes. Yeah, so it's still not reliable.

**Speaker B:** So people who were comatose way back when instead of being hospitalized and hooked up to all kinds of equipment. And then they still have that— when are you going to pull the plug? Is the big question that happens often.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** What do they mean by pulling the plug? Is— are the vital signs strong enough to keep a dead piece of meat alive? And so what the point of death is We only know that it's a process. And deep into that process, for instance, the body grows cold, the life goes out of the eyes, rigor mortis sets in, the body begins to decay and rot. OK. But a body just laying on the ground who has just been recently shot, you don't know whether he's dead or alive. You don't have any pulse, but that's no guarantee. Why? Because they often take pulse from the arms, and when a body is in bad shape, it will contract and have all the blood circulating just between the heart and the, uh, the brain. Okay, and so, uh, the cops coming by and checking for a pulse is no guarantee. That somebody's dead or not.

**Speaker A:** Well, I suppose that's why you feel for them, karuna to the other. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now, what we do know though is, is that when the body begins to starve for blood and the brain begins to starve for blood and starve for oxygen, it begins to malfunction. And it malfunctions in the state that we would call experience. It begins to experience malfunctioning. And so people who have that kind of malfunction, they begin to function again. They come back with stories about floating out of their body. They have experiences of light and traveling, and some of them even have stories about, I met my granddaughter and my grandmother— my granddaughter or grandmother or whoever that we met along that journey into that light told us, oh, it's not your time, you've got to go back.

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep, that's the one.

**Speaker B:** All right, so those are the ones that have an experience, and the real teaching of the Buddha is not about a particular experience. It's about how does that experience, if you're going to let it, actually change your life. So when people have an out-of-the-body experience— in fact, I forgot who it was, but his name, excuse me, he was a very famous writer And in World War I, he got shot. He almost died. He had an out-of-the-body experience. He came back to write about it. He was quite, uh, a popular writer. Tolkien, huh?

**Speaker C:** Tolkien.

**Speaker B:** I don't think— Tolkien. R.R. Tolkien. I don't know. I don't remember. But I do know that since medical science and, oh, anesthesiology and a lot of surgeries that go after people who would normally have died anyway and bring them back from the brink, they have all of these stories and imaginations about what happened. Well, guess what? People who were sitting in a dull state of mind called meditation, when they're not breathing well, they can have these kinds of experiences also. Because the mind gets starved from oxygen, the heart rate goes down. They've actually experimented with that, that people in fact who are experienced meditators, their blood flow goes shallow. Their blood pressure drops low, their breathing is not good, then in fact, Fourth Jhana is probably fairly close to death in those vital signs. And so, if you are not well trained, then those are the kind of experiences, and people are going to come out of those kinds of meditation experiences with all kinds of fanciful things that they dreamt up while their body and the mind was starved and in a state.

**Speaker A:** So maybe it's a good thing to have a bit of the hindrance of skeptical doubt.

**Speaker B:** Actually, I would say that in a humorous sort of way, yes, that's true. But a better way of saying it is that no, what we really need to do is to learn to control the mind, to control the body, body and to control the way that we feel. And that's why the Buddha recommended first Jhana, because we're breathing well, we're thinking sharply, we're watching what's going on. And he did not recommend for Jhana as something that was necessary for anyone. But one of the things that we do know is that we need to come up with enough observation of that stuff to recognize that when perceptions stop, feelings stop. Which means that those people who are having out-of-the-body experiences, their perception and their feelings are probably running pretty wild with whatever left they've got of oxygen. Rather than being able to slow things down and bring it to a halt while you're fully conscious, fully awake, fully careful, fully oxygenated. And this is what the Buddha would recommend. And yet very few people, even some old, old Buddhist masters, have not been doing the practice of what the Buddha taught. They've been practicing whatever their old traditions had. Of going very close to the state of death because they're not breathing well. There's in fact a whole set of procedures. They practice this in Thailand, and one of the ways that they practice it is the guy, as he gets fairly close to death, he changes his diet. And one of the diet ways of doing it is to eat only Sun, raisins and dates. Have a diet of raisins and dates. Why? Because it's heavy-duty sugar, not much moisture, and that helps dry out the body. Okay, there's other bodily things that they can do so that the body will actually preserve. Now, the reason that the body is well preserved is because the body is already on a diet of only raisins and dates is already dehydrated. And so these bodies can stay un— oh, how they don't decompose the way.

**Speaker A:** That a normal body—.

**Speaker C:** Sounds like an awful way to go.

**Speaker A:** Well, it is rather. I mean, why would you want to do that?

**Speaker B:** Oh, Oh, for the same reason that they will swallow rocks. Why? Because after they're cremated, the rocks will be there among the remains. And that's one of the indications that this guy is a special whoop-de-doo master, is because he had stones in his body. Well, he swallowed the darn things.

**Speaker A:** Is that how they get it? I mean, yes, you get these stories about sort of rainbow particles and so on after the guy has died, you know, been cremated, whatever. I didn't realize they did it by swallowing rocks.

**Speaker B:** Right, and the guys who were staying at that monastery, the ones who feed him the dates and feed him the stones, because their monastery is going to get really famous later.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** This is all about human activity and human greed, and it's got this magical quality to it. And the magic is that somehow or another, I'll live forever, I'll learn to fly.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, we've got a fair amount of that in Christianity, people flying about the place. And I think that— I think they do that in Japan as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a worldwide human stupidity.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the whole point of the teaching of the Buddha, in fact, the whole point of living in general is, can you have fun right now? Can you have a good life right now? Can you remember that you don't have to go do any of that kind of stuff? You can actually be okay? Can you be okay moment by moment by moment in this life, this now, the next moment, the next life, the next now, one after another after another, and enjoy the frigging load out of your life? That's the question.

**Speaker A:** Now this brings me back in a sort of a roundabout way to the point I was trying to get at before we got sidetracked onto Upajayas and all that kind of thing. And technicalities of the Buddhist monasteries. And that was to say, one of the problems that I've had and always had with entering into, well, with Piti in particular, I've said that I often get sort of very strong bodily stuff going on. With the Piti. And this seems to me that it must, it is effectively physical pleasure. And the Buddha seems to have been very much against it. And he's always, he was always, hang on, he was always ranting on, was he not?

**Speaker B:** No, was he not? Wait a minute, don't keep going on because I'm not listening because you made a statement and let's straighten that out. The Buddha was not against pleasure, and the best place that I can show you that is in Sutta number 36 when he actually says, why am I against the pleasures of the first Jhana? They have nothing to do with sensuality.

**Speaker C:** So the apple tree, right, under the.

**Speaker B:** Rose apple tree scene, yes, that's the whole point of it was, is that when— that's when he came to understand, um, and that you can see that there's a big difference between sitting quietly and feeling really good versus going to the brothel, going to the races, driving fast, getting drunk, robbing a store. I mean, wow, don't you really get pumped up when you go rob a store?

**Speaker A:** Haven't ever tried it actually, but maybe if I have a next life I'll give it a try.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's pumped up with fear, just like driving really, really fast or going on roller coasters. People are seeking thrills.

**Speaker C:** I love horror movies.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, horror movies are full of that. It gives that adrenaline kick.

**Speaker A:** But the whole of this idea of sensual pleasures being filthy pleasures and so.

**Speaker B:** On surely means— They're not filthy in and of themselves, they're dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Surely means that you should be avoiding them. So he shouldn't be going to horror movies. Because he should be getting into the first jhana and see if— People have.

**Speaker B:** Been known to die in their theater seats in horror movies. Uh-huh. Scared to death, literally.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Okay, people have been known to have chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and some new kids on the block by going to brothels.

**Speaker A:** Okay, of course you do.

**Speaker B:** Yes, people have been known to have cirrhosis of the liver as well as falling down and being face down in mud because of alcohol.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure we all know somebody who's fallen down drunk and hit his head and died.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. Okay, so this is what we're getting at, is that the sensual pleasures, when pursued are dangerous, and they're especially dangerous. Okay, they're especially dangerous. We'll see you later, Daniel.

**Speaker A:** Cheers, nice to talk to you.

**Speaker B:** All right, they're especially dangerous when people don't get what they're wanting out of those, uh, let us say, practices, and go back and do it over and over again until finally they do have some real damage. And what we're actually looking at is that the first Jhana, including the rapture and the Piti and the good feelings and the Kundalini racing up your back and good breathing and well maintaining, there's no danger in that unless you're doing it at the wrong place at the wrong time.

**Speaker A:** Well, you see, I've had to get past the feeling that there is a danger in that. Because, and this is all to do with, you know, childhood prohibitions, because, you know, the sort of, you know, there is a sexual element in all this.

**Speaker B:** Yes, there is.

**Speaker A:** That was so much beaten down in childhood and adolescence by one's upbringing.

**Speaker B:** I don't think that they were as hard on it in Asia and other places as they still are in Western culture. I think the Catholic Church had an especially harsh— Oh, it did.

**Speaker A:** It did.

**Speaker B:** —Influence on Western mindsets.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That they haven't gotten over it yet.

**Speaker A:** They haven't got it. And the Prods took it with them, you know, the Protestants.

**Speaker B:** Oh, took it with them and whipped it into real shape. Yes, exactly. Okay, yeah, then in fact, here's something really funny about Christianity. If God was so against sex, why did he invent it in the first place?

**Speaker A:** Oh well, because he wanted more Christians. Quite simple.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, who needs babies?

**Speaker A:** And in fact, it was the Jews who invented that, because it was the Jews who really invented, as I understand it, You know, the concept of any sex that was done that was not for having babies was to be frowned on because you want more babies in the tribe.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. And the tribe in this case is often the Catholic Church. But here's the point about that. Having babies historically has been dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's Buddhist mother and child. There's too many people.

**Speaker B:** Right. That's one thing that's dangerous about sex, is we can have too many people. The other side of it is, the danger is, is that the human race could die out. But that may not be a bad thing at all. Well, humans, I think, are, let us say, overinflated egos as to how marvelous humanity is. I think that the apes and the animals get along just fine without humans.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm sure they will, but there'll not even be apes and animals the way that— where we're going. There might be a few cockroaches.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but here's the point, is that they don't have prohibitions against sex. They have styles. An example of it is a female dog does not have big tits. She does not go and have silicone breasts. In fact, her tits are the same size as the male tits unless she's pregnant or getting into season. And male dogs don't have much of anything to do with female dogs unless the female is in season. Well, that's the whole— but human women are in season 24 hours a day.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, it varies a bit in the menstrual cycle, but, uh, but yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's fertility, but they'll jump in bed any opportunity. Unless she's got a training, unless she's been told not to.

**Speaker A:** Well, she's usually told not to at great length because— because she's likely to.

**Speaker B:** Just jump right in bed. That's the human way of doing things. Let's go play with it.

**Speaker A:** Sure, well, we all do that.

**Speaker B:** I mean, okay, and part of that is because humans are smart enough to know how to go look for pleasure. But they're just stupid enough to not realize how dangerous some of those pleasures are. Okay, so hence back to the teaching of the Buddha about the Jhana is that he says, why am I afraid of the pleasures that I receive in Jhana? Because they're not the same thing as the sensual pleasures that have dangers associated with them.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And so there's problems with the translations, and I think that the problem is the word sensual. Okay, sensual can mean senses, but it almost always doesn't. Almost always sensual means sexual. Of course, just like the word love does not always mean liking, it sometimes is a sexual thing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** Just like Freud said, and the funny one is, is that he says that sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but most of the time is phallic.

**Speaker A:** Oh God, when I was— I was very interested in, in Mainly because, well, I was very interested. I read stuff by, I think I read at least one book by Alfred Adler, and certainly something by one of his offshoots, you know, one of his disciples, if you like, because I was very interested in the inferiority complex, because as a 15-year-old, I thought I had one. I probably didn't. I probably just felt inferior. But there it was. And I mean, I did read some Freudian stuff and, you know, Charlie Chaplin's umbrella. Oh, for God's sake, give me a break. You know, that's a penis. Give me a break. But there we are. You find yourself unable to, you know, it's not just There's all sorts of things you're unable to believe and you're going, "Anapanasati, give me a break.".

**Speaker B:** So that's one of the things then that we can say, is that sitting alone, sitting quietly, breathing well, and having marvelous thoughts and bringing up feelings of pleasure, etc., are generally not sexual.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, breathing, by the way, you bring up something there that I wonder about. I mean, I have heard you talking to various people about taking command of the breath and, you know, breathing in very deeply and effectively.

**Speaker B:** Not very, just somewhat deeply. Very deeply is an extreme.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Because you added the word very. I did.

**Speaker A:** I did. I did. Well, I thought that's what you meant, because I thought that you should start by getting as much air in as possible.

**Speaker B:** No, I would say in fact about 80% to fill up about 80% and go down to about 30%. And most people go from 40 to 60.

**Speaker A:** What I've found actually, sort of watching the breath is a tendency, well, and I do find this is helpful to me, is I take in a lot of breath and I get it up sort of to what I feel is as much as it will take. I let it go out quickly, and then I leave it to its own devices to keep on going, going out. And then at the end, there is a sort of feeling that, well, if I want to get it all out, then I'm going to pull up in the abdomen so as to push up on the diaphragm, you see, and get more out.

**Speaker B:** And That way, that's an extreme. I have seen people at the gas station jumping on the bumper of their car to get a last glassful of air out of the tank so that they can put another glassful of less than a pint of more gasoline in. And I've seen meditators do that same sort of thing. To where we're not trying for an extreme.

**Speaker A:** Right, so we're not trying for an extreme, so we get the breath going, but then there is a tendency when, you know, when all the sort of feelings arise to let the breath go and do its own thing.

**Speaker B:** So you're right, which is a mistake that will help take you out of the Jhana. That's the funny thing too, that watching the breath and having long, easy breathing and we get ourselves into a big beautiful state and then we forget all about the breathing and pay attention instead to the states that we're in and that's why the states don't last. We need to continue to enjoy the breathing along with the process.

**Speaker A:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Not let it go but to make sure that we're getting enough oxygen. In fact, what will happen is after people do that They'll stop paying attention to the breathing. Their body is already oxygenated. The automatic system then will just shut it all down. And now we begin within, let us say, 1 or 2 minutes. The body goes from completely oxygenated world functioning into oxygen starvation.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But then Sometimes the sort of thrills of the Piti cause one to breathe deep, cause one to take a deep breath.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes?

**Speaker A:** Sometimes you get that.

**Speaker B:** And but the Piti generally doesn't last for a long time. It peaks and then it comes back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's right.

**Speaker B:** Into just pleasure.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, that's where you're sitting, breathing. He trains himself, he trains himself for breathing in. I fully experience Sukkha, presumably that's the point of— Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that Sukkha is feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And the pity is that high, when we say, "I can do this," that's the success. And we need to have both a little bit of the pity and the Sukkha together, but we have to keep breathing well, because otherwise the breathing will stop and then it goes downhill again, sometimes into those states where people have these really, really weird experiences like lights and going through tunnels and grannies at the other end saying, go back, go back.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, yeah, I'm actually— yeah, well, I'm straying into sort of territory that I, you know, you're recording. I don't want to talk about stuff that happens problems to me so much.

**Speaker B:** Well, we don't have to talk about it in that sense, we can talk about it in a general sense, and in fact that's, you hear me not.

**Speaker A:** Talking about my own personal experiences. But that's like the girl going into the chemist and saying, I want a pregnancy test because my friend thinks she's pregnant, you know, I mean, it's fairly obvious what you're actually saying in that situation, you're not talking generally.

**Speaker B:** But there's a difference between going into the pharmacy and saying, "My girlfriend needs advice," and running down the street whooping and hollering about the results of your pregnancy test.

**Speaker A:** Hopefully the negative results.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's a middle path in there someplace. And so it's okay to not talk about experiences, especially in the sense of bragging.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's right. I—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because other people, when they hear talking about it, they get jealous, they get greedy. Oh, I want that. I've heard a news story.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. Well, I won't brag, but I'm saying I think I've had a little bit of success recently.

**Speaker B:** So, well, I congratulate you on having success. Continue to enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** I do.

**Speaker B:** One thing that's true, and that is the success that you have while you're sitting quietly is better than the success of going on Reddit to brag.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, well, anytime I open up Reddit, of course it wants me to join or something, I have to sign in. I don't do that.

**Speaker B:** That's what Reddit wants. The people on Reddit who's already signed up, they want to argue.

**Speaker A:** Sure, well, arguing is fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, going to the brothel is fun. But it's dangerous. Driving really fast at 120 miles an hour is a lot of fun, but it's dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. I'm just fiddling about with— we have.

**Speaker B:** All the fun that we want and do it safely.

**Speaker A:** Power. Fiddling about with wires and chargers and things here because I'm running out of power on this computer. Okay. Yes.

**Speaker B:** So that's the way that we can talk about it, is can you find a safe way to have pleasure so that it's not dangerous, it's not Dukkha? You see, that's the problem with all that sensual pleasure— racing their car, going to the brothels, chatting up the girls. Getting drunk, bragging on Reddit, and all of that kind of stuff has dangers to it. The danger is we become dissatisfied somehow or another, either through the cirrhosis of the liver or because we actually do get in an argument with somebody on Reddit and he makes a point that we don't like. And so now I'm suffering because I was arguing with somebody on Reddit and he won. Oh my, that's almost as bad as the clap.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So can we find a safe way to find pleasure? Can we in fact be safe without having extremes of pleasure? Just a little bit, a little dab will do you.

**Speaker A:** Well, we have to give ourselves permission to take that pleasure because so much—.

**Speaker B:** Of course, because a lot of our culture has denied us permission.

**Speaker A:** Indeed. I mean, the general theory seemed to be, one found it a bit off-putting as a child, certainly, or as a young person, you're supposed to deny yourself for 70 80 years, however many years you've got, and then you go to heaven. Well, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, what are you going to get in heaven?

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know what you're going to get.

**Speaker B:** It's already shrunk down to the size of a dried grape.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, not only that, but all of those people who got forgiveness for their sins, they're the ones who are going to be in heaven robbing you blind. Picking your pocket, telling you what to do and where to go. I mean, who needs a Saint Peter anyway? Well, I mean, another politician, maybe Saint Putin.

**Speaker A:** That's a happy thought, isn't it? Joined with Saint Hitler.

**Speaker B:** I can do without heaven, thank you very much. I'd much rather be dead.

**Speaker A:** Well, of course, that's the— never mind about heaven, it's much better than hell, much better than burning for all eternity sort of thing.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you think about it, heaven is only the ultimate or the extreme form of 'I like it,' and hell is only the extreme form of 'I don't like it.' And death is the exact dead center middle of those two things, where there's no liking or not liking. Yeah, but— Yeah, but— Yeah, but— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But— I mean, surely the middle is to try and have something to like, even if you don't get to have to like it too much. Yeah, or dislike it too much.

**Speaker B:** All right, that's the whole point then. Can we live our lives liking it without wanting it too much?

**Speaker A:** Whoops, looks like you're getting somebody else on. Yeah, well, I better— I better— That's.

**Speaker B:** Kind of noisy here for a second.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's a call coming in, isn't it? I think. Anyway, you've got a call there, so maybe it's time for me to go. Or in the words of Deputy Dog, the time has come for me to go, for us to go, and we'll be back with another show. Anyway, there we are. Okay.

**Speaker B:** I'm just sitting here quietly waiting for— there it goes. Finally it stopped. Okay. So what have you been saying for the past 2 minutes? I couldn't hear a thing.

**Speaker A:** What? What? Oh, what were you waiting for?

**Speaker B:** Because if somebody was calling, it was ringing.

**Speaker A:** All right, right.

**Speaker B:** You could hear it in your background? Yes, I hear it in the blasting my ears.

**Speaker A:** Oh geez, right, right, I got you. No, I was just saying you've got another call coming in. And I should go.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go have fun. You go that way and have fun, and I'll go this way and have fun, and everything is all right. No heavens, no hells needed.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy. Thanks a lot for this talk.

**Speaker B:** It's been good. I enjoy it. I always do, Jerry. I really like our talks together. All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Well, I suppose that is why I think I shouldn't be calling Dhammarato, because I have nothing to say to him.

**Speaker B:** But every time you do, you wind up with a mouthful and an earful.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, this is also true. Okay, cheers then. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Sangha friends (Speakers A and C), revolves around a critical examination of mystical experiences, religious dogma, and the core purpose of Buddhist practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Themes & Discussion Points:**

1. **Skepticism Towards Mystical Experiences:**  
   - The conversation begins with an anecdote about a meditator who, after a stroke, interpreted his sensations as being in a "Vajrayana mudra body."  
   - **Key Insight:** Experiences (lights, out-of-body feelings, etc.) are often interpreted through pre-existing religious or cultural frameworks. They are **mental events**, not objective reality.  
   - Dhammarato emphasizes that such experiences are not "lifestyle" or validations of truth—they are just experiences, often arising from physiological conditions like oxygen deprivation.

2. **Critique of Religious "Magic" and Afterlife Narratives:**  
   - The group questions the evidence for heavens, hells, rebirth, and near-death experiences.  
   - **Key Insight:** Stories about the afterlife are perpetuated by the **living**, driven by fear of death and desire for immortality. The dead do not complain.  
   - Dhammarato points out that much of the "magical" material in Buddhist texts (like the *Visuddhimagga* or Tibetan *Book of the Dead*) is later cultural accretion, not the Buddha's core teaching.

3. **Rebirth Reinterpreted:**  
   - Rebirth is reframed **metaphorically** as moment-to-moment mental states.  
   - **Key Insight:** "Not being reborn" means not falling into unwholesome mental states (like anger, greed) here and now. It’s about **choice** in present-moment awareness.  
   - The famous line "I am not coming back" is interpreted as confidence in living fully now, not as a metaphysical claim about literal reincarnation.

4. **The Goal: Finding Satisfaction in the Ordinary:**  
   - A central question is raised: *How can people be happy with the ordinary?*  
   - **Key Insight:** The Buddha’s teaching is about finding safety, comfort, and joy in **present reality**, not chasing special experiences.  
   - The purpose of practice is to "have fun right now," to live well without needing extremes or supernatural promises.

5. **Jhana and Pleasure – A Correction:**  
   - Speaker A expresses a common misunderstanding: that the Buddha was against pleasure, especially the physical rapture (*piti*) of first Jhana.  
   - **Key Correction:** Dhammarato clarifies that the Buddha distinguished between **dangerous sensual pleasures** (addictive, harmful) and the **blameless pleasure of Jhana** (stable, mindful, based on well-being).  
   - The pleasure of meditation is safe and to be cultivated, not feared.

6. **Importance of Balanced Meditation Practice:**  
   - The discussion covers practical meditation tips: breathing fully but not extremely (80% in, 30% out), and maintaining mindful breathing even in joyful states to avoid oxygen starvation and weird mental experiences.  
   - **Key Insight:** Sustaining balanced attention on the breath is crucial; losing it can lead to dull, oxygen-deprived states that generate hallucinations.

7. **Cultural Conditioning and Permission to Enjoy:**  
   - Speaker A notes that cultural (especially Western religious) conditioning often makes people feel guilty for experiencing pleasure.  
   - **Key Insight:** The practice involves giving oneself **permission** to enjoy the safe, wholesome pleasure of meditation and a simple life.

### **Overall Message:**
The talk is a call to **demystify Buddhism** and focus on its practical, psychological core. It encourages:
- Letting go of the pursuit of magical experiences and afterlife fantasies.
- Interpreting suttas pragmatically and metaphorically where appropriate.
- Cultivating a happy, balanced life through mindful pleasure (like Jhana) and present-moment acceptance.
- Embracing death as a natural part of life, without fear or need for heaven/hell narratives.

The tone is skeptical, humorous, and grounded—emphasizing that the real "magic" is in living well, right here, right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about meditation, religious interpretation, and the nature of experience:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"We speak in a language that we have heard before"** – This is used to explain how people interpret unusual experiences (like a stroke or meditation sensations) through pre-existing religious or cultural frameworks (e.g., Vajrayana bodies, the Absolute).
2.  **"My train has arrived, I'm climbing on board"** – A metaphor for accepting death willingly and peacefully, as opposed to being forced "kicking and screaming."
3.  **"A little dab will do you"** – Borrowed from an old advertising slogan, used to advocate for moderate, safe pleasure rather than extreme or dangerous pursuits.
4.  **Heaven and Hell as extremes** – Heaven is described as "the extreme form of 'I like it,'" and hell as "the extreme form of 'I don't like it.'" Death, in contrast, is the "dead center" with no liking or disliking.
5.  **Sensual pleasures as "dangerous" pursuits** – Activities like driving fast, robbing a store, or arguing online are compared to going to a brothel or getting drunk—thrilling but risky, unlike the "safe" pleasure of *jhāna*.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**
1.  **The Meditator Who Had a Stroke**: The story of a meditator who interpreted the sensations of a stroke through the lens of Vajrayana "mudra bodies," illustrating how we frame experiences with learned concepts.
2.  **Near-Death/Out-of-Body Experience Experiments**: The story of doctors placing bright signs in operating theaters to test if people having out-of-body experiences could see them. The fact that "nobody ever sees the signs" is used to argue that these are mental experiences, not literal astral travel.
3.  **Historical Tests for Death**: References to unreliable historical methods like holding a mirror under the nose to detect breath, and the sale of coffins with bells for the mistakenly buried, highlighting human fallibility in determining death and the fear of the unknown.
4.  **The "Raisins and Dates" Diet**: A story about certain ascetics in Thailand who dehydrate their bodies before death to preserve them, and even swallow rocks to be found in their ashes—presented as an example of "human stupidity" and the desire for magical recognition and legacy.
5.  **The Buddha Under the Rose Apple Tree (Sutta 36)**: Referenced to argue that the Buddha distinguished the pleasure of *jhāna* from dangerous sensual pleasures, using the Buddha's own moment of insight as a story to authorize safe, meditative enjoyment.
6.  **Freudian Cigar Joke**: A humorous reference to Freud's famous quote ("sometimes a cigar is just a cigar") to critique over-interpretation and the tendency to sexualize everything, including spiritual experiences.

These metaphors and stories serve a central purpose: to demystify intense meditative or near-death experiences, critique the human tendency toward "magical thinking" and desire for specialness, and advocate for finding safe, ordinary pleasure in the present moment.
