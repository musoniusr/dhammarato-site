### Transcript


**Speaker A:** In fact, I was just about to ask you a question that was specifically phrased like that.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** In the sense of, or in the expression of, that you go around feeling like you're on the way to something, or that you've got business to complete, or something to be done. ...that when you're around others, that you feel obligated somehow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I like to do, to be a certain way, when I feel completely a different.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. This is what you could call a hindrance, of the feeling like something should be done, We're in fact not hindered, means that you have the feeling that nothing needs to be done, that everything that needed to be done has been done, the job is completed. Or another way of talking about it, which is actually the way that the Buddha also mentions it, is that you feel like that we have arrived home, that we're no longer on a journey.— that we can set our bags down, relax. You're home now, the journey is over. You see, when you're out in public, you feel like you're on a journey with them, that you've got things to do. So it's basically the same kind of feeling, which is a feeling of being unsettled, not at rest, ready to jump. Are.

**Speaker B:** Jumping.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So the Buddha talks about it in the sense of that someone is out on a journey and that they've got baggage, they've got Maybe he's a merchant and he's got camels loaded down with all of this baggage, making his way across the desert of India or something like that. And then he arrives home. So imagine the difference of the feeling of being out on the journey, in danger, at risk, and working to get someplace, versus after you arrive home, you can.

**Speaker B:** Relax.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, most of the time we feel like that we've got something to do, that we're on a journey, that there's someplace to go, something to do, something to carry, some obligation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's like a feeling that there's like this seeking energy looking for something from other people no matter what, you know. It's like I can see and it's almost like a validation seeking or something like it just constantly wants something from everyone and it cannot settle or it cannot be something that doesn't want anything, you know. I can't be in that. I can see see that it can never experience that, like it can just, yeah, it can just settle for being here, that it's always looking for something, like some unfulfilled thing from a long time ago, still looking to replay over and over and over, you.

**Speaker A:** Know? Or something like that. Right. But then the first thing that you said was, is that you're looking for others to get rid of that feeling for you. That you have, you feel what comes unsettled and work to do. Now you're looking for help. Or.

**Speaker B:** Blame. Or blame. No, I mean, it's like when I'm around other people, I can feel like my mind just has this, projects this something that I'm ignorant of onto the person and then I have to try to understand it, what it is. You know, and I see that it's something very unwholesome, you know, like someone reminds me of a certain thing or whatever. And my mind is just like sees that in that appearance and then it starts to replay something or it starts to feel a certain way. It's usually like density in my forehead and a lot of contracted heaviness in my chest and it makes me feel like I have to be and act a certain way even though I try to really just observe that. A lot of the time it's just like, almost like, just do what I say kind of script, you know, it's like close off, don't say anything, be quiet. It's usually like that, like don't express anything, just walk, keep your face down, kind of old script that I used to run, you know, because that's kind of how I think I learned how to stay kind of avoid, that's my aversion tactic, just keep your head down and, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, Well, actually, keeping your head down and being quiet is an attribute, but you're doing it when you feel bad. Could you put your head down and be quiet and kind of ignore the situation and chuckle inside? Well, I'm glad I don't have to deal with these people. My job here is done, my work is finished here, and I'm going to sit here and just book down and keep my mouth shut and enjoy the show. Let them take it from here. But you're already telling me that you're exiting stage.

**Speaker B:** Left.

**Speaker A:** That I'm what, sir? Exiting stage.

**Speaker B:** Left.

**Speaker A:** Exiting stage— you know, the left and the right side of the stage, that when people come in, they enter from one side of the stage, and when they exit, they exit stage right or stage left, or if they jump off into the crowd, I guess that would be stage center, but normally it's left or right. So, you can just get off the stage and enjoy the show. You've heard, no doubt, that Shakespeare has been quoted to say, that all the world's a stage and each one of us is a.

**Speaker B:** Player.

**Speaker A:** Yes. For that, it goes deeper than that. It gets really interesting, and that is that we're all feeling like we're on stage, and guess what part we're playing? The answer is, we've got a script. We've got a life script that we accumulated over many, many years, and we're reading off our script, that's what we do. And so there you are putting your head down and shut up, you said you learned to do that, you put that in your script.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I came to this large place with a lot of people to unlearn that. You know, I live with a lot of people and I came here because I knew I had to, feel like I had to work out of that. It's worked quite well. Because I just jumped in there and I just started to like pull myself through social interaction and get out of this kind of shell, and it has worked quite well.

**Speaker A:** I don't understand when you say jump right in there, you mean you're jumping right into their argument?

**Speaker B:** No, like jump right into, uh, like usually I would shell off and be quite isolated, like loner person, and I realized that's just not really that good of a life to live, you know. And so I just kind of jumped in, in the sense of I wanted to get out of this old script that kept me in a shell, you know. So I went into a lot of social interaction very intensely, you know. That makes sense?

**Speaker A:** So it's kind of— Yes, it does. And it also sounds like an ordinary way of trying to solve the problem. And in a way throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

**Speaker B:** Throwing the baby out with the.

**Speaker A:** Bathwater? That's an old expression from the.

**Speaker B:** South.

**Speaker A:** Okay. You see, what your original intention was, is to get rid of the feeling. That you got yourself feeling bad, and so you're looking down, and you're being quiet, and you're feeling bad. And you're saying, "Oh, well, maybe I can change the way that I'm feeling by not looking down and starting to talk," as if that would be the cure for the issue of the feeling. Yeah. Where in fact, you've already heard me recommend looking down and keeping your mouth shut. The throwing the baby out with the bathwater basically means that you threw the baby away and kept the bathwater. We need to swap this around, okay? Because what we really need to do is to start looking at these feelings. Yeah, okay. And work with the feelings directly. So you actually wanted to blame other people in the sense of, oh, I feel bad, maybe they'll help me to feel better. All I have to do is to go go get in an argument with them, and generally that doesn't.

**Speaker B:** Help. No, it doesn't.

**Speaker A:** In fact, you're probably— they're probably already in a bad mood anyway. Could be in a good mood, but you don't even think about that. You don't suss, well, what kind of mood is each person here in? Can you figure out what they're going to be doing next? How is this thing going? Start watching what people are doing, but we can do that observation happily while we're looking down and kind of looking out of the corner of our eye and keeping our mouth shut and watch the show. And I'm very big on telling people to watch the other people, to watch their.

**Speaker B:** Show. Okay, I thought you meant watch the show as in watch what's happening inside yourself, the feelings.

**Speaker A:** That's part of the show.

**Speaker B:** Part of the show.

**Speaker A:** Okay, start watching that, uh, the show, both on the inside and the outside, and you see that you were always outside-oriented in the sense of looking down and keeping your mouth shut and feeling bad, or, uh, outside-oriented in the sense of opening your mouth and starting to talk. But the inside feelings remained the same, or if they changed, they didn't change for an improvement?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's— I feel like it was— I got a lot of confidence socially, like that's what I got out of it, so to say. But inwards, inwardly, it's just this— inwardly it didn't really change that much. Even after months of very— like a long time of being alone by myself and then months of very intense being around people, it didn't even change that much. It's just a lot of more confidence and understanding of behaviors and stuff, but inwardly the way I feel didn't even change that much. It's still dead.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, that's what we're talking about. Now you've introduced the word confidence. And the real confidence comes in the confidence of feeling the way that you want to feel rather than the way that you used to feel, or the circumstances cause you to feel a certain way. Instead, you feel the way that you want to, and you know you can. Now that's confidence.

**Speaker B:** I can imagine.

**Speaker A:** I can imagine. Well, you can downright see it directly.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I would more like to see. I see, like, when I've been practicing over the last week, I had these very momentary glimpses of weight. So I would be like, I'll be walking and I'll just be like, I can just recognize that I'm absolutely safe and I'm safe and then I can be satisfied with this. Even though I feel so unsatisfied, I can be satisfied that this is all like, this is what is happening, this is what is. And if I just like kind of be satisfied with this little satisfaction, it starts to become a bit more quiet. You know, and I can see how much I'm unsatisfied with trying to be satisfied with this little satisfying feeling. And it's more and more becomes silent, like there's not much of a— it's like, you just kind of— it's not like giving up, but it's more like a surrender feeling. I was like, this is it, like, this is where I'm at. And I just— it's quite a bit of silence. And then I had small glimpses of feeling good, usually when I reflect on like appreciating what's around me and not taking things for granted, like truly reflecting on, wow, look at all this stuff I have. And look what my parents, like what people didn't have and all the comforts and conveniences. You can start to feel like kind of more good about things and I'm not looking for something that says like, fill me so much when I could see the abundance around me in some ways. But yeah, the underlying unsatisfying things quite lingering, you know, but I know it's just the effort and the practice. And I was like breaking my head in a good way, like not in a bad way, but really the amount of effort I saw this was, especially like between, yeah, between this last week, I see how much effort this is. It's crazy, but it does really work. And it's really cool to see sometimes that it's not that much effort. Like it starts to become a little less, like I'm doing the same thing, but it's not as much as exertion of effort. You know what I mean? Like there's not much of an exertion, but yeah, it's, I'm really enjoying that part of self-talk.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] All right. So, today we've been talking about the feeling of being unsettled or having some work to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so how would you be— how would you deal with that directly? The first thing is we have to wake up to the fact that there it is, the feeling is there. When it's there, do you know where it resides? Is it in— you said, in fact, you mentioned the chest already.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's generally like tight tension in my forehead and heavy contracted dense feeling in my chest, usually. So those two things are bouncing up and down.

**Speaker A:** Knitting one's brow. Let's see if I can do it. I've forgotten how. Or curling the forehead, which doesn't work anymore. I don't— ah, there it goes. I got a little of it. Okay, these are signs of confusion, and other things like this. And when people are actually— in Buddhism, when they talk about concentration, the kind of concentration that they start to do is the knitting of the brows and the purring of the head, which causes tension. So, the better thing to do is when you see that stuff, or when you recognize it's there through the feeling, Then what are you gonna do with.

**Speaker B:** It? I just usually just look at it, I had, I usually look at it and if I have a strong— Well.

**Speaker A:** That would be what the Mahasi people would say, is just to look at it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and then as I have been doing this stuff, what I was doing is, so if the heaviness or the tension is really strong, I have this self, I say the words but, I can say it hundreds and hundreds of times, and I've just been doing that, but it's just, it is what it is. I just keep saying, and I, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know. Gee, please listen, we've got someplace to go with this, okay? And that is, is that this is all mapped out in the Anapanasati Sutra for those who can understand it. So you're experiencing the body and you're experiencing tensions in the body. One of the places we've noticed it is here, and the other one is up here. Well, step 4 of Anapanasati is that I relax it, intentionally relax it. So how are you going to relax this tension right here? How are you going— how would you do that? One of the things you could do is give yourself a massage. You can relax it like.

**Speaker B:** That. I never tried that in my whole life.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, give it a bit of comfort and joy. And now feel it after you rub it for a while, and then feel it again, and then experience it, and recognize that you've got a really nice third eye there that you can just kind of open up and feel really good about. But it has to do with relaxing rather than tensing.

**Speaker B:** Up. Yeah, I can even feel it now a bit. Incredibly dense. It's like, it's crazy. It's like just so much density here. It's like, it's like someone's pushing their finger straight into your head, like as hard as they can.

**Speaker A:** It's Anicca. And, and what? And you like it very much, or, and you don't like it at all, or you don't really give a flying rip, you just know it's there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's been there for like a— I've noticed it for about a year and a half now, and it's— there's nothing I've ever done that worked, because I want to get rid of it so bad, I just gave up. So, it just pops in and.

**Speaker A:** Out, like— Okay. Well, another way of doing it is by being tender with it. Rather than wanting it to go away, you can massage it. You can allow yourself to relax. You see, part of the reason why you've got this habit of tension is because you don't like it. That not liking is also the tension in the chest. When we don't like things, when we're against them, then we actually get tense. We put up resistance. Right? And so when we want something to be here and it's not here, we welcome it, or we try to grasp or want it to come in. But when something is going on that we don't like, there's pushing. We resist it, we push against it. Right? So that pushing that you're doing This is what I'm trying to get you to begin to look at, is that that tension is because you don't like it and you're resisting it, which makes it even more tense. Yeah, you go around talking about how tense this is, look how tense this is, and the more I hate it.

**Speaker B:** The more tense it is. Yeah, yes.

**Speaker A:** It's true.

**Speaker B:** But if I see something like— when.

**Speaker A:** I see the teaching of the Buddha, that in fact, uh, many systems know about this, and, uh, I think it's in the American Indian tradition where they say that we bring to us that which we fear. Basically, we bring to us that which we're thinking about, that the mind is the forerunner, and we create our reality mentally based upon our habits from the past. Where in fact, if you dropped all the habits, you could actually start over again. Sometimes people do. You can really just start over again. And be happy instead of unhappy. But most people can't remember to make that switch, because it's not a great big decision, a one-time decision at all. It's a very small decision in this moment, time after time after time after time. You change the attitude, you can change the way that we think. So you've got attention. Ah, I see the attention.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I see the attention and then it's not just enough, it's not just enough to accept it as it is. You have to also create that wholesome thought with it alongside it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you become delighted that you can see the tension.

**Speaker B:** Arahant, I see you.

**Speaker A:** I see you, Mara. I'm delighted with it. I see you, Mara. I see this stuff. Because how are you going to deal with it unless you can see it and be happy with it? And in fact, you see that you're tensed up and making yourself tense, then if you hate it, you'll just be more tense. If you can use it as a signal— oh, oh, I feel that. 'Oh, that's telling me I'm all tense stuff. Oh, thank you very much for the message.' Ah, and we can just relax. See it as a messenger. Begin to appreciate who you are, to stop being critical with ourselves. 'Oh, you should not have that tension in the forehead, right? You shouldn't have that, so you should not like it, or you should hate it, right? But if you do it with a nurturing attitude, you can say, 'Oh, never mind, poor dear, we'll just massage it away and everything will be hunky-dory.' And that's a matter of attitude. Change your.

**Speaker B:** Attitude.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now, another part of the attitude is, is that when that tension is there and pushing, pushing really hard, part of the feeling that we have is being victimized by that pushy, pushy, very hard. We become a victim to it. We're not in charge of it. It's in charge of.

**Speaker B:** Us. Yeah, that's what I feel. That's what.

**Speaker A:** Basically— Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what basically it is. It's what I was saying like the other— when I'm like walking around and I see certain forms that it does feel like I am— it seems to appear that these forms are external and pulling it in towards me, and then it's happening, and then I'm being a victim of it. But I know it's just my mind doing that, you know. And then I just have to— I'm.

**Speaker A:** Not sure about the.

**Speaker B:** Word 'them' as confusion. Ah, like people, like other people. Okay, yeah, so yeah.

**Speaker A:** Sorry. When you see people Yeah, other people. Because you can also say that the tension in the forehead is also a form of.

**Speaker B:** Formation. Yeah, it's a formation, a dense swirling pulsating.

**Speaker A:** Formation. And you hate it, and that's the formation. And you've been in the habit of hating it for a long time, and you've been in the habit of hating all kinds of other stuff. And so hating things is also a form of formation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's how I cope with things, just hate.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** Pardon? That's how I coped when I was younger. I just hated things that were causing me pain. So I have this habit of seeing something I don't like and just really hating it, like really separating it from me, you know, as much as I.

**Speaker A:** Could. And so you take your hatred and you put your head down and you shut your.

**Speaker B:** Mouth? Yeah, I just don't— that's exactly what I hate. And keep the hate. That's what I did when I was a.

**Speaker A:** Kid. Well, you learned that habit as a kid, and so you're continuing to do it. But when you were a kid, you probably knew you were doing it even more than you recognize now. It's such an old habit that we're not even aware that that's what we keep doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** When I see it— The hatred is not quite there. Quite so strong enough to actually wake up to.

**Speaker B:** It. It's all kind of dead.

**Speaker A:** So that's— yeah. And so that's what I'm inviting you to do, is to wake up to these feelings, but not in the way of hating them and wanting to get rid of them, because that's what you're already doing with the tension up here. You're hating it and wanting to get rid.

**Speaker B:** Of it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and it's the hating and wanting to get rid of it that we also want to look at and recognize that you don't have to have that attitude. You can cultivate liking who you.

**Speaker B:** Are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, as you are, you're okay.

**Speaker B:** Already.

**Speaker A:** We're just hard on ourselves. We've gotten ourselves up to scratch, but we won't leave it there. We keep telling ourselves, no, you're not up to scratch yet, get better. So we get better, and then we keep telling ourselves, you're still not up to scratch yet, get better. There are areas of mathematics that you do not understand yet, get that book out. Or whatever it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like meditation, that I haven't gotten something I read that people are talking about, I'm not good, like I'm not, yeah, something like that.

**Speaker A:** Ah, that's a very common habit for people who read books, is that they get into competition with the examples and the people in the books. That's correct. Compare.

**Speaker B:** Themselves. Yeah, it's just happening in the back. It's just, it's like almost just happening, like, you know, it's just from, from a lack of awareness. It's almost like a background program that's just happening, like comparison and competition stuff. And when you don't see it, it builds up and builds up. It's a habit.

**Speaker A:** So this is what we do now is we practice looking at that stuff. And begin to see it clearly while it's in process so that we can begin to change it. But in fact, if you keep changing that stuff every time you catch it, you'll begin to gain the confidence that you can change it. But we have to practice changing that stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've noticed I had little windows in the last week where I realized I can change that, and it was really a nice feeling, like I really trust trusting myself feeling kind of thing, you.

**Speaker A:** Know. So you can change because you know you can change, because you've watched yourself change, because you practice changing when you even didn't believe that you could change, but you did. You you started watching that you can change it anyway. Yeah, you know that you can do it, that you can get good at making changes. But so many people want to get the problems over with so that they have no more trouble coming their way without having to develop the skills. An example of that would be things that are too heavy. That I don't like picking up things that are too heavy. But if I go to the gym and work out, then I've got more strength, and then those things that I used to hate to pick up, now I can pick them up.

**Speaker B:** Easy.

**Speaker A:** So this is a matter of getting the skills going, the skill to be able to see those feelings and see our, uh, the things that we have, the words that we're using. And make a change to it, to change those unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, to change the feelings by playing with them, to play with those sensations in the body. People who give themselves headaches almost always have the headaches because they've got some tension in the neck, which means that the muscles in the neck are so tight that the blood cannot flow back down, but it sure gets pumped up through an artery. Okay, so what we need to do then is relax the neck, roll it around, and the headache will go away. Especially if you just think, "Well, this is not much of a headache anyway." But if you say, "Oh, my head hurts and I hate it and I hate it," then you're making it worse. Creating more.

**Speaker B:** Tension.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So the art of relaxation is also the same art as just don't worry, don't care. It's okay.

**Speaker B:** No problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've got face tension. Yeah, I've got a headache. So what? Whoops, where would he go? Oh, he slept.

**Speaker B:** Already. Yeah, I think most of the craving I have is to feel more of anything, you know, because I had over the years created a habit where I numbed my emotional experience down quite a bit. You know, and it's like very flat. It's always either, even with negativity, it's even still flat. It's a weird kind of thing to describe. It's always like, it's always on this, it's not linear at all. It's not, doesn't change almost. Of course it's changing, but the way I experience it, it's as if nothing changes. And then it's the craving, the feel more, but then it's just craving to feel good, isn't it? But even, yeah, so it's just craving, craving, craving. But I wonder, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I guess it's, I guess the emotions just Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's just craving, isn't it? I guess it's— yeah, maybe they would come if I recognized.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the things that you're not talking yet about is the fact that you're just trying to suppress the negative feelings without actually doing anything about the positive feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you can actually change it upside down. Okay, you understand, for instance, that magnets have poles and they attract and repel depending upon which way they have, but that magnetic force is still there in the magnet. You can't cut a magnet in half. Okay, so when you're trying to suppress the bad feelings, you're just suppressing.

**Speaker B:** All feelings.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the other thing to do is to take those negative feelings and turn them upside down to get your polarity straightened.

**Speaker B:** Out. Take the negative feelings and turn them.

**Speaker A:** Upside down and turn it around. Yes, turn your negative positions upside down. Okay, I hate this. Into, "Aha, I see you!" Welcome it, welcome the things that you resist, and resist the things that you welcome, and start to play with this as a game, so that you can learn what we're talking about here, that you can change. You don't have to suppress the negative feelings, you can change them from negative to positive. That you can feel good, you know how to feel, and just suppressing negative feelings still leaves you with a great sense of longing, incompleteness, because you haven't learned to control your feelings yet. Yeah. And how do you do that? Is by remembering to look at the negative thoughts and then turn them upside down by gladdening the mind. Like an example would, "Wow, I'm glad I don't have to think about that anymore." Whatever it is, an argument that we had, or an email to write, or problems to solve in any way, and then we say, well, I don't have to do that right.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I could just sit here and watch this wonderful face tension that I carry right here. Let me give it to the Anahant. That feels so.

**Speaker B:** Good. Yes, yeah, just be inviting and welcoming, welcoming. But when you say the polarity thing, you say, when you say resisting the positive things, are you saying, are you saying things like resisting craving?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm saying that when you get yourself into a state of not liking, see that and turn it around. Okay. Never mind all the analogies that I've used, just recognize that you can change the way that you your attitude and your feelings about things. And the way to start easy is to start by recognizing that you're safe, and so you can convince yourself that right now it's not dangerous. Right now I can take a breath and relax because it's not dangerous. Yeah, and I can recognize that I am comfortable, and I can get to self Get the body comfortable, even if that means to give a massage. It's okay to get the body comfortable. And once the body is comfortable and we feel safe and secure, now we can start working directly on Anagami, and everything is okay, everything is.

**Speaker B:** Fine.

**Speaker A:** Which is that satisfaction. No problems, no worries, nothing needs to be done. The job that needed to be done has been done. And what job is that? To come out of the hindrances and come out of the unwholesome thoughts, come out of the unwholesome feelings, and feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. We practice that. It takes.

**Speaker B:** Practice. Yeah, even just one week. Has been great, like, it's.

**Speaker A:** Crazy. Okay, so continue this practice. Recognize any tensions that you have in the body and bring the body back to a state of comfort and nourish the body. It's okay for you to feel.

**Speaker B:** Relaxed. And you know, In terms of sitting meditation or just going to sit, since I've been doing this, I stopped the body scanning that I learned. And I've just basically been, this is where I'm a bit confused because let's say I've been doing this endlessly through the day, basically every time I could remember to do it, I'd do it throughout the day. But when I go to sit, for example, that I'm still doing it, but I'm not sure what, sometimes I'm not exactly sure, I'm usually just watching the breath go in and out, you know, and I'm, when negativity things happen, I go back into the first.

**Speaker A:** Thing. When you say watch the breath, that's a key word for me. The way to state it and the way to practice is with Sati. You mindfully breathe in long, and you mindfully breathe out long. This is not a watching game. This is a control issue. We don't just watch the tension in the forehead, we control it. Control it in whatever way that we delight. With the breathing, we mindfully begin to control the breathing, breathing in long, breathing out.

**Speaker B:** Long. And are you still talking while you're like, are you still noticing like, this feels so good? Like, you know, are you still doing these?

**Speaker A:** Those would be the kinds of things that you could say while you're watching your breathing. Wow, this is a good breath. Wow, I really enjoy this one. Okay, feels cool, feels really nice to breathe in. And you can think of it, you can talk to yourself about it. Wow, it's really beautiful right here. What a nice temperature it is. I can feel this the breeze and the air. Arhat talks about the touch of the cloth, but he doesn't talk about actually getting a kick out of that, enjoying it, being in the moment and being alive. Really enjoy being alive. I mean, most people will have to admit, especially after I put it to them with the right kind of questions. That being alive is the only thing that is important. Nothing else is important. If you're dead, then nothing matters. So if you're alive, then that's the only thing that is important. And yet we're not ever paying any attention to that. We're paying attention to this, that, and the other thing instead of paying attention to being alive. Well, how do you know that you're alive? You know you're alive because of the senses. The sense organs is the connection to the world, the universe, is through the body. And the body has these senses. They have the touch, the proprioceptive, we have sight, hearing, and we can feel that air as it comes in. But we don't spend our time in our senses, we spend our time in our thinking and thoughts. We live our lives in the past and in the future, and we don't appreciate how wonderful things are right here, right now. And so we can begin to do that, begin to appreciate being— instead of being on stage reading a script, You can just enjoy the show, inside and out. Just watch. But we have to watch it with control. You have to learn to control the way that you feel, otherwise you're just going to go around feeling bad. We have to learn to control our breathing, otherwise we're going to continue to breathe shallowly, especially when we're afraid. And so, on a regular basis, remember to take a deep breath. That keeps the mind refreshed, gives oxygen, cleans the lungs. So there's physiological good value in mindfully breathing in long and breathing out long. Makes us feel better, takes away the tiredness sometimes. This is all part of the Buddhist practice. Is get yourself into a really good positive state that we call Sukkha, where you feel satisfied because you actually enjoy this breath. This is a really nice one. I'll have another. Make the next one a.

**Speaker B:** Double.

**Speaker A:** So we begin to play with it, play with the body. You don't have to do any body scanning or Morbid or anything, we can just really pay attention to the body. Pay attention to the hands, pay attention to the sensory input. And we can do that with the eyes too, if we don't have the eyes closed. If we have the eyes closed, never mind. If we're not listening, never mind. When we're sitting with the eyes closed and not listening and very silent, then the basic input is going to be through the body. So we pay attention to the body and how good it feels just to sit here. But when the eyes are open, then you can add that, "Wow, what a marvelous multi-array colors of green." Got all green, greens and browns, natural colors. The sky is blue, open sky. The weather is nice and we can experience all of that stuff, as if you lived in a paradise, because guess what? You do. So we begin to appreciate the paradise that we're in by paying attention to it with our.

**Speaker B:** Senses. Yeah, yeah, when I was been doing that A lot of the time actually it feels like, sometimes it feels like there is this feeling like I'm really forcing it or something, like the appreciation of things. That okay, I really am, it seems like, it's like nothing is happening, but maybe this is.

**Speaker A:** Just It's a test for us that nothing is.

**Speaker B:** Happening. Okay, okay. I guess I just don't pull, push the ball far enough down the hill for it to become big, for the avalanche.

**Speaker A:** You don't need an avalanche.

**Speaker B:** I don't pull the snowballs hard.

**Speaker A:** You don't even need a snowball. All you need is just a.

**Speaker B:** Snowflake.

**Speaker A:** Snowflake. And pay attention to what beauty that is in the snowflake. You don't need the snowball, you don't need an.

**Speaker B:** Avalanche.

**Speaker A:** A little dab will do you. Be satisfied with very little. Learn to be.

**Speaker B:** Satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Right, the satisfaction will grow. If your satisfaction is not good enough, then it's not satisfaction at all. Now, is it? It's wanting something that we don't have instead of, I don't need anything right now, I'm.

**Speaker B:** Good. Yeah, actually, I've been avoiding this. I have been avoiding the satisfaction self-talk a bit because it's so It's so alien. I don't even know what that means, you know. I don't know what's satisfying. Even when I'm full and I eat food to my stomach is bulging out, it's still unsatisfied, you know. So I guess it's just the satisfaction. What am I doing? Like, it's just, okay, I appreciate, like, this is nice, this is good, this is enough, this is enough, basically.

**Speaker A:** It is learned behavior, more is better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the whole teaching of the Buddha is upside down. Everything is on its head. We are not trying to gain anything, we're trying to.

**Speaker B:** Drop.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. And we need to learn to control that so that we can set it.

**Speaker B:** Down.

**Speaker A:** And this is why the Buddhist teaching is called Vajrayana, negative. Everything is negative. Westerners see everything as a positive game, so they want Jhanas, and they want stream entry, and they want rebirth and reincarnation, and they want magical powers, and they want to be finished with it all and just greed, greed, greed, greed. I want this, that, and the other thing, instead of being satisfied the way the Buddha teaches with what's happening right now. Even if there's a bunch of nothing, or even very little nothing is going on, that's okay. No jobs to do. If you want stuff, you've got work to do. You feel.

**Speaker B:** Unsettled. If you want to— can you repeat the last part you just said? If you want stuff to do?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you want stuff to do, then you're unsettled. So just allow everything has already been done. There's nothing to do. Paradise is already here. It does not need to be improved or fixed. Everything's okay just the way it is.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay as everything is as it is, and that's how it is. Because, and then wanting to change it.

**Speaker A:** And you can accept that or you can reject it. Most people, they hear that in Buddhism and they say it, but they still reject it. They're still pushing on.

**Speaker B:** It. Yeah, like, this is not profound enough, this is not, this is not, it's.

**Speaker A:** Not good enough, right?

**Speaker B:** This is not profound.

**Speaker A:** Enough. And it's good enough. Who knows how profound things can be versus why is it just profound enough? Just a little bit, just a little bit profound. Yeah, but there's nothing to do. Everything's already a.

**Speaker B:** Paradise. I seriously need to, uh, to take a walk.

**Speaker A:** Go see how beautiful the world is. Go check it out for yourself. Everything's already okay. The world is just filled with very unhappy people by the billions, 7 and counting. Yeah. That doesn't mean that you have to remain unhappy, that you can in fact see that everything is all right, doesn't need to be.

**Speaker B:** Fixed. Yeah. Do you ever, like, do you feel like things have to change, or do you feel like you have to do something about people's unhappiness happening in the world?

**Speaker A:** Well, everything's just— let's put it this way, okay? We've got a young puppy, she's going on about 8 weeks, and it's about time to start potty training her. But we've got some special issues with special dogs that keep her from being able to go down the stairs outside, and so we got a little issue. Okay, so she poops on the floor, and when I see the poop on the floor, oh, no problem at all, that's just natural, everything is wonderful. "Here, let me get some tissue and I'll wipe it up and throw it out. I'll even show it to the.

**Speaker B:** Puppy." Wait, is that it? I don't know, I don't get what he's just— Pardon? I'm not sure if that was— I don't understand.

**Speaker A:** Well, how many people really hate that they have to clean up clean up a pile of dog shit on the floor time after time after time, 3 times more a day. There that dog is again, crapping on the.

**Speaker B:** Floor, which is the normal attitude of people. You can't really change this, is what you're saying?

**Speaker A:** Well, the puppy's still in training. And so I nurture the puppy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I clean the floor happily, because the other people in the house, when they clean the floor, they do it because they have to, because the floor is dirty. I clean it because I'm happy to do.

**Speaker B:** That. I see, you don't have to, because you want to, because you're happy to do it.

**Speaker A:** No, I can just leave that pile of crap right right there on the floor because I know somebody else will clean it up, but I'll have to listen to them grumble when they.

**Speaker B:** Do. Right. Yeah, like, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you can start treating the whole world like so, like that. Yeah, so what, there's a dog poop on the floor. That's all right, it's just part of nature. You want the dog to stop doing it? In fact, I've got an old joke. This is not a joke, this actually happened. My uncle, who was in the farming business and all of that, he had a little piglet that had been born, and this pig got fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter, just going like that, and was also quite ill. And so he took it to the vet, And the vet inspected this and says, you know something, this pig doesn't have an asshole. Let's make him one. And all he had to do is just start to touch that razor-sharp scalpel. He just touched it and boom! And there was pig shit all over that place, including both my uncle and the vet. Oh my God. What?

**Speaker B:** So it's like a cartoon story, like the episode in the.

**Speaker A:** Cartoon. When he was alive, that was his favorite story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So when you want to poke holes in somebody's ass, be.

**Speaker B:** Careful. Be careful. I see. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So now that you're getting to the point of understanding that life can become a game, and whatever that you've got to do is a toy, and you can choose to play with it right now or.

**Speaker B:** Not. Okay, so it's just my attitude, my.

**Speaker A:** Experience of what's happening that determines— No, it's you following the rules. You were told how to.

**Speaker B:** Feel.

**Speaker A:** In fact, as a little kid, you learned how to feel by watching the adults around you feel the way that they felt when they had to go to work. And so you've learned to hate a job by example. Little human or monkey do, monkey see, monkey do, right? So the little kids, they see what parents do, how they feel, and they act accordingly. Go along to get along, and we feel the way that we're supposed to feel. And you can actually have fun at doing whatever you're doing. You don't have to hate it because it's a job. We, in fact, look at the words that we have. We could call it employment, but we don't. We use words like work and.

**Speaker B:** Job, hard work.

**Speaker A:** Hard work, tough labor. Labor, right? Hard labor, right?

**Speaker B:** Hard labor. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Play, play, play, play. To do it hard is if there's more power in it. But now we're beginning to understand the power is not in power itself. The power is in the control. And the Buddhist path is all about learning to control the way you think, the way you breathe, the tensions in your body, to relax, and to have Sukkha instead of Dukkha. And it's worth practicing. Every time you remember to look at where you're feeling, look at the tensions and say, 'Ah, I see that.' You hear that banging? That's Lucky putting her ear in the.

**Speaker B:** Fan. Is that the puppy's name, Lucky?

**Speaker A:** No, the little puppy is Panda. Lucky's 7 years old.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker A:** So I have Lucky on one side and Panda on the other. Just another paradise.

**Speaker B:** Okay, just in paradise. Okay, these talks are so helpful, man.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll finish this one. Yeah, and, and that you recognize that you, you, you can do the Vipassana technique Technique by understanding your body from the perspective of relaxing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like I really want to understand what you're saying and Anapanasati. Like I really want to understand this and practice it. Because it works really well, so far. It just works quite well.

**Speaker A:** So. Okay, we'll see you later then.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you soon.

**Speaker A:** You're in paradise.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'm in the playground. Okay, great, great, cool, cool. Thank you, Dhammarato, really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on overcoming a pervasive feeling of **being unsettled, obligated, and "on a journey"**—a state identified as a fundamental hindrance to peace.

### **Core Teaching: The Hindrance of "Something to Do"**
*   The key problem is the mental feeling that you are on a journey, with baggage, business to complete, and obligations to others. This creates internal tension, seeking, and a lack of rest.
*   The **antidote** is cultivating the feeling that **"the job is done," you have "arrived home," and nothing needs to be done.** This is a state of peace where you can set your baggage down and relax.

### **Speaker B's Personal Struggle**
Speaker B describes this hindrance manifesting as:
*   A seeking energy looking for validation or something from others.
*   Physical tension (density in the forehead, heaviness in the chest) and old mental scripts (e.g., "keep your head down, be quiet") used as aversion tactics.
*   A social strategy of jumping into intense interaction to break out of his shell, which built confidence but **did not resolve the underlying unsatisfied feeling**.

### **Practical Instructions & Shifts in Attitude**
Dhammarato offers direct guidance to work with this:

1.  **Recognize & Locate the Feeling:** First, wake up to the unsettled feeling. Identify where it resides in the body (e.g., tight forehead, contracted chest).
2.  **Relax the Body, Don't Just Observe:** Move beyond passive observation (like noting "tension"). Actively **relax the bodily formations**. Massage the tense areas, roll the neck. The goal is to bring comfort and nourishment to the body.
3.  **Change Your Relationship to Discomfort:** The tension persists because of **resistance and hatred** toward it. This "pushing" amplifies the problem.
    *   **Shift from hatred to welcome:** See the tension as a helpful messenger. Practice saying, "Aha, I see you!" with delight, not aversion.
    *   **Stop being a victim:** Recognize you are not victimized by these feelings or external forms; your mind is creating the experience.
4.  **Cultivate Wholesome Thoughts & Satisfaction:**
    *   Actively replace unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones. Gladden the mind.
    *   Practice **self-talk of safety, comfort, and satisfaction**: "I am safe," "I am comfortable," "Nothing needs to be done."
    *   **Learn to be satisfied with very little.** The craving for "more" or "profound" experiences is part of the problem. Paradise is here now; it doesn't need to be improved.
5.  **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) as Active Control:**
    *   Breathing practice is not passive "watching." It is **mindful control**: "I breathe in long, I breathe out long."
    *   Infuse the practice with appreciation: "This is a good breath," "I enjoy this."
6.  **Engage the Senses & Appreciate Paradise:**
    *   Get out of thinking about past/future and **dwell in the senses**—sight, sound, touch. Appreciate the beauty and abundance already present.
    *   See life as a playground, not a stage with a script. You can choose to play joyfully with whatever is happening.

### **Key Philosophical Takeaways**
*   **The Buddha's teaching is "upside down":** It's about **dropping** (greed, aversion, tension), not gaining (special states, achievements). It's about contentment, not seeking.
*   **You can change:** Confidence comes from the proven ability to change your feelings and attitude in the moment, through repeated practice.
*   **Attitude is everything:** You can approach any task (even cleaning up dog poop) with grumbling obligation or with happy, nurturing playfulness. The event is the same; your suffering or peace depends on your attitude.

In essence, the talk is a guide for transforming the burden of "something to do" into the freedom of "nothing to do" by changing your relationship to bodily tension, thoughts, and the present moment through active relaxation, wholesome mental cultivation, and sensory appreciation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk are:

### **1. The Journey vs. Being Home**
*   **Metaphor:** The core metaphor compares our usual state of mind to being **on a difficult, burdensome journey**. We feel we have "business to complete," are carrying "baggage," and are "at risk." The goal of practice is to arrive at the feeling of being **home**—where the journey is over, we can set our bags down, and relax. Nothing needs to be done.
*   **Elaboration:** The speaker (A) specifically references the Buddha using this metaphor of a merchant with loaded camels crossing a desert, finally arriving home.

### **2. The World as a Stage / Having a Script**
*   **Metaphor:** Life is compared to a **play** ("all the world's a stage"). We are actors following a **life script** we've accumulated over the years. Our reactive patterns (like putting our head down and being quiet) are learned lines in that script.
*   **Elaboration:** Speaker A advises that instead of acting out the painful script, one can "**exit stage left**"—get off the stage and simply "enjoy the show," observing internal and external events without being trapped in the role.

### **3. Throwing the Baby Out with the Bathwater**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** This is an **old expression** used to describe Speaker B's approach. B tried to solve social anxiety by forcing interaction (throwing out the "baby" of quiet observation), but kept the "bathwater" (the underlying bad feeling). The solution is reversed: keep the useful technique (observation/quiet), but discard the negative feeling associated with it.

### **4. The Snowball / Avalanche vs. The Snowflake**
*   **Metaphor:** Speaker B feels that generating appreciation or satisfaction requires a big effort, like pushing a snowball to start an avalanche. Speaker A corrects this, saying you don't need a massive change; you only need to appreciate the **snowflake**—the tiny, beautiful detail in the present moment. "A little dab will do you."

### **5. The Magnet / Polarity**
*   **Metaphor:** Our emotional habit is compared to a **magnet**. Trying to suppress negative feelings (one pole) inadvertently suppresses all feeling. The solution is to **reverse the polarity**—welcome what you usually resist (negative feelings) and resist (let go of) what you usually crave (positive outcomes). It's about learning to flip your attitude.

### **6. The Puppy and the Poop (Paradise in Mundanity)**
*   **Story/Anecdote:** Speaker A shares a personal story about happily cleaning up after a puppy. While others grumble about the chore, he does it without complaint because he chooses a happy, nurturing attitude. This illustrates the larger point: **paradise is here now** if you change your relationship to experience; even mundane or unpleasant tasks are part of a "playground" if you don't label them as burdens.

### **7. The Piglet Without an Asshole**
*   **Story/Anecdote:** A humorous, cartoon-like story about a vet who, upon discovering a piglet had no anus, merely touched the spot with a scalpel, causing a dramatic, messy release. The moral drawn is: **"When you want to poke holes in somebody's ass, be careful"**—a playful warning about trying to "fix" things (or people) that may release more than you expect. It underscores the theme of accepting nature as it is.

### **8. The Gym and Building Strength**
*   **Metaphor:** Developing the skill to work with negative feelings is compared to **going to the gym**. You build the "muscle" of awareness and attitude change through practice. What was once a heavy burden (a negative feeling) becomes easy to handle with developed skill.

### **Secondary/Implied Metaphors:**
*   **The Messenger:** Bodily tension (like in the forehead) is framed as a **messenger**, not an enemy. It's delivering information about your state of mind, and you can thank it and relax, rather than hate it.
*   **The Playground / Paradise:** A recurring concept that the present world, exactly as it is, is already a **paradise** or **playground**. Our unhappiness comes from thinking it needs to be fixed or that we need something else.

These metaphors and stories work together to convey a central teaching: shift from a mindset of *wanting, fixing, and burden* to one of *acceptance, playfulness, and homecoming* by changing your relationship to present-moment experience.
