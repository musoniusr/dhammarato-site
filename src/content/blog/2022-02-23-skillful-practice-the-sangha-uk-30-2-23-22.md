### Transcript


**Speaker A:** is a fight when like traveling by car or by train, like this experiencing of life like kind of like a movie happening within like Bhavana space. That's still pretty fucking terrifying to me, in a way.

**Speaker B:** What's terrifying about that, brother?

**Speaker A:** It's a good question. I can't actually answer it. Maybe just the fact that there's— first, it's so infinitely— it appears so fucking vast that there's no way of grasping it. And then also the fact that there is no reference frame for it anymore.

**Speaker B:** Do you need to grasp it? Do you need to have a reference frame?

**Speaker A:** Apparently I still feel like I do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, good seeing, right? So seeing that, seeing that, can you explore the possibility of just not grasping, not framing. Would it be okay if you didn't grasp? Would it be okay if you didn't frame?

**Speaker A:** I'm not— I think in theory yes, but I'm still processing the whole thing. I'm still like pretty shaken up. I'm not to really feel like I can fully integrate it yet. I'm still experiencing like little tremors and shaking in the body from processing all that fear after I'm now in a place where I feel a bit more safe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would expect integration to come a little later. Yeah, the investigation it sounds like is already running.

**Speaker A:** Right, I don't know, but that was a pretty big ordeal, that train ride today.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I know that you do well with handling sensations. We've spoken about that lots, right?

**Speaker A:** What else? Like, in a way, what else was I to do?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, you say that, right? That's where you've come to in your practice, but there's lots of other things you could do, like freak the fuck out.

**Speaker A:** I did.

**Speaker B:** You did?

**Speaker A:** In a way, yeah. On the inside, I was freaking out, freaking out pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty damn, damn much.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** All the time, but a lot of the time.

**Speaker C:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** What did you do with the freaking out?

**Speaker A:** Um, tense up mostly.

**Speaker B:** Okay, physically you weren't looking, you weren't investigating. It would surprise me to hear that you weren't looking and investigating.

**Speaker A:** Um, a little, a little maybe. It's— I, I was mostly, I was mostly concerned with seeing what I can to not be overwhelmed all the time by the sensations.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so was this a train ride that you had to go on today?

**Speaker A:** No, I didn't have to.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you did this as practice?

**Speaker A:** I think so.

**Speaker B:** Great!

**Speaker A:** I actually I had a difficult decision to make because I took it because Nora wanted me to, and I wasn't sure because I hadn't traveled in a long time because of being scared.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I don't know, yesterday I was actually pretty chill, like moving around my more familiar areas with more ease and shit. And I also talked to some guys on the True Freedom server, and after 3— no, like 4 people, including Nora, told me to take the trip because I was very Undecided. I wanted to avoid such a difficult experience like it was pretty badly, but I also— So my suggestion would be a smaller event or a smaller trip, starting smaller, right?

**Speaker B:** And then getting bigger because Alex will remember this one. When we're drinking from the fire hose, all that phenomena in, it's, it's not the optimum condition for practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right.

**Speaker B:** I'd like to have a handle on that valve to say, well, let me slow things down a little. And maybe that's a walk or a short car ride when you're in control of the vehicle.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's, it, it, I, I kind of feel like I got my ass kicked a bit today. Yeah, but I'm also— and this is one of the things that baffles me again and again— somehow I'm still here, still breathing, still standing, still coming to see Sangha, right?

**Speaker B:** Still coming to talk about it openly and investigate it.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to do this badly today because I felt I really needed it.

**Speaker B:** Good. Good.

**Speaker D:** Yes, that's good.

**Speaker E:** Very good job, man.

**Speaker B:** Very good. Is there anything more, Doug?

**Speaker A:** No, there isn't much, much more to say about it. Uh, I'll, I'll make way on the stage for someone else.

**Speaker B:** Well, before we finish with that thread, do you feel like you could, uh, begin a kind of practice that involves short journeys, small journeys, maybe not so far from home, whatever a baby step looks like.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I could, and I even have, but maybe this was a bit much of an increment in the step.

**Speaker B:** Well, so now you know, right? And that's no different to any other kind of practice, right? We're experimenting all the time. So one time we might try not enough, the next time we might try too much. And that's how we find the middle way.

**Speaker A:** I'll have to make the way back in a few days. But I actually, I really don't want to think about it right now because all it's doing is stressing me out even more.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's your practice again, right? So if even the thought of it brings symptoms of anxiety, well, here's an opportunity to practice. Great. And framing it in the context of practice, right? I'm not going on a train ride, I'm practicing. Now the whole thing has a different flavor. Yeah, yeah. Well done for being so brave. Well done for sharing all of that. So openly. Yeah, we're trained, aren't we, to think that there's something wrong with us if we're scared, but that's faulty.

**Speaker A:** Oh boy, I still have that one as well a lot.

**Speaker B:** And yet here you are sharing.

**Speaker A:** Guilt for feeling guilty for suffering a lot.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? Okay. Okay, that kind of surprises me because you're so good at sharing about it. Yeah, and yeah, it's there. Nice job testing your boundaries, says Rick.

**Speaker A:** Thanks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is there. So it's there, but perhaps not to the degree that it might have been in the past. Certainly I remember a time where I wouldn't have told anyone that I was scared.

**Speaker A:** I'm also— it varies greatly. Sometimes there also is a point of being like, fuck it, this is too much right now. I don't give a shit. I need to get it out somehow. Even today I realized, like on the train when I kind of had to sit up and walk a bit and stuff, or just behave in a way that might be like someone else could notice it and wonder about it. I noticed myself in that frame of thought, but I was like, nah, man, I'm gonna do now what I need to kind of get through this, and screw what others think. Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Great. Well, once again, brother, I feel like you're— how to say it— as much as the symptoms are symptoms of struggle and distress, you're still able to report with such clarity about what's going on. Once again, we have another of these situations where you're reporting Dukkha, dukkha everywhere, and yet I don't really feel concerned for you.

**Speaker A:** That's interesting. There is like this quality of just observing it all is pretty present, yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and that it's that clarity that gives me faith that you will find your way through all of this.

**Speaker A:** I think it has also saved me a number of times already from Just being like at the verge of losing it completely, but then not losing it completely because something's there that prevented it.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think it's likely that seeing, if we're in a situation where we're freaking out and our concept of what's going on is that we're rather like a leaf being blown about on the wind, that all of that stuff out there really does have the power to make us feel these things without relief or mercy, then we might just think that it's gonna continue endlessly. We've no outlet such as our Sangha call in the evening. We've no outlet such as our clear seeing by which we can see all of those sensations as object. It's just all happening.

**Speaker A:** It has truly felt this merciless, but there's also something— there's also our mercilessness. Yeah, this kind of quality about it, like today where I was like, man, I can't really do anything about it right now anyway.

**Speaker B:** So there's a surrender quality. In a way. So I may as well— so, right, so I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** In a way, it certainly did feel like it, but I still chose certain things over other things.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. So there's a degree of surrender also. That actually sounds like a degree of control. The right kind of control. I chose. I chose certain things over other things. So in a sense, now the image that comes is of the drowning swimmer who's being thrown down the rapids, who certainly isn't going to be able to swim against the current but might be able to direct the body to grab onto a branch. Or two.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, so you say, but that I'm not doing so well right now is often enough to just take the edge off a smidge.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, and, and you say that you're not able to put a lot of it into words. I know it's difficult, and yet your reportage is always wonderful from where I'm sitting.

**Speaker C:** Well done, well done.

**Speaker B:** Hey, Ron, good to have you. Hey, Robert.

**Speaker D:** How's it going?

**Speaker B:** See you guys. It's going well. It's going well. Ron, I received your text. I didn't get back to you because I'm pretty much offline for a week or 10 days now, but I wanted to come and do this, and I'm glad I did because there's 9 of us. How wonderful.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I'm glad you're here, Dad. It's always a pleasure talking to you.

**Speaker B:** Always, always. Welcome back, Carl.

**Speaker C:** Hey, hey guys, good to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Does anyone else have anything they want to share?

**Speaker C:** I might have something.

**Speaker F:** Great.

**Speaker C:** So I'm gonna try to word this as clearly as I can because this might take me a bit of time. Sure, sure. Today I woke up and I just decided I'm not gonna go to work. I'm like, I just didn't want to deal with the Dukkha inside of the world, the world that creates. So I'm just moving to seclusion myself for today, just to see how I feel. I've been struggling with this, with Anapanasati practice recently, because I'm looking at my mind and I'm seeing my mind, and even using the words like my mind is a bit crazy to me because I'm identifying like it says something as mine when it's not even there. Like I'm not seeing the mind, but yet I'm claiming it all the time, clinging and clinging and clinging. But then when it comes to de-body, I'm able to detach myself from my body or detach myself from experiences. I'm not claiming experiences or any sensations in my body anymore. But when it comes to the mind, I'm still clinging to the mind. And that causes so much confusion because I'm not sure how, even if I say I can let it go because there is no I. So I'm really mind-boggled by this whole thing because I've been, even that language I use with myself when I talk, I try to avoid like I, me, whenever I spot that I'm like, what is this? Why am I creating this false language within myself? Whenever it comes to the mind, I'm freely using I, my mind. I want to do this, I feel that. Yeah, with everything else I don't feel like that.

**Speaker B:** Great. So I can't possibly know enough about what's going on to say this with any certainty, but I wonder if it might be that it's a— the tidiest way to say this is that it might be a head-heart thing. A great teacher called Adyashanti talks about three levels of knowing: head, heart, and gut. And it sounds like it might be the case, Carl, that you know that the body isn't you on a heart or a gut level, but that to say that the mind isn't you might still be a head level. You know theoretically that the mind isn't you, but perhaps you've not quite seen through that yet. And it sounds like that's the kind of frustration that might occur where I'm saying I all the time with regard to the mind. I know there's not a mind. If you see that directly, there's no problem anymore. That makes sense?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that sounds— yeah, I feel— I, again, once I say I feel like I don't see it directly, it just pops up and I cling to it. But with everything else, I'm able to separate it. There's more like moments I have more space, more distance between those things.

**Speaker F:** Well, can I actually butt in here and say something?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker F:** So a little while back, Dan was telling me about how the mind functions based off of pattern recognition and pattern execution, basically. And, you know, upon pondering that for a little, one of the things that I came to realize One of the reasons it's so hard to disidentify from the mind is because you're trying to see the bare sensations of reality as it is. But the thing is, the mind has a pattern execution system for when these sensations come up. And what I've come to see is that the mind, you kind of identify with that pattern execution. And so whenever a sensation comes up, your brain generates a reaction.

**Speaker C:** That does make sense. If you don't mind asking a question. So essentially, I feel like this is one of the things where I was struggling in my practice. Struggling is a funny word to me. Until I came out according to Dhammarato and I was introduced into gladdening the mind, Anapanasati. I can't even say the word yet. Way of gladdening the mind, because I feel like that's the missing factor. But at the same time, I've done, I feel, not a lot, but I keep noticing myself in different ways that I'm able, as I said, detach myself from my body, detach myself from sensations and emotions. But the mind, as Ron probably said, is still creating those habits and patterns, yet I'm still clinging to it. So I feel like maybe I'm just not practicing it correctly with the gladdening the mind, or I'm just still stuck in Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** I'm wondering about perhaps trying to simply replicate whatever success that you're having with the body. You say you're able to disidentify from the body while the body is just Sensation is something observed, same as the mind, or what we might call the mind in a moment. I suppose the word mind is problematic because it can mean so many different things. But in a moment, you've got experience, and some of that experience we call body, and some of that experience we call mind. I wonder if you could look at whatever part of experience in a moment you're calling mind in the same way as you're looking at body. Yes, Scott?

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, just to add on to that, like, um, just as bodily sensations are seen as sensations, thoughts are actually themselves tangible sensations too. It's just that usually, usually you think you are like the linear mental talk. So like you identify as the mental talk, so it's easier to see like bodily sensations as sensations, but the mental talk is actually a tangible sensation that's appearing in awareness too. So if you can look a little bit closer at thoughts, like the moment they arise and catch them, like which that comes with practice, like the more you do it, the better you get. You can actually see that even those are like, it's a tangible sensation, just like appearing, same as a bodily sensation or mental imagery.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, you're right. I think I'm just missing the gladdening the mind factor still, because I only been practicing this for like maybe a month or so. So I'm still not cleaning out my mind as efficiently as I should be, I guess, before. And I'm not seeing the thoughts as they come as quick as I could be.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's a should in there.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Right, which is always tricky territory. Hey, DJ.

**Speaker E:** Hey.

**Speaker B:** And yes, there was something else. In there that got my attention. Rick, did you have something to say that became nothing to say?

**Speaker H:** Well, that happens a lot, doesn't it? I just want to— I'm not sure if it directly addresses it, but I would like to mention that I, in my experience, what I've seen is that certain sensations and reactions, like the moment of identification seems to happen at different speeds. And I know when it comes to thoughts or thinking, it happens so rapidly. With physical sensations, I guess I notice it's a little bit of a slower process. So it's a bit easier to distance or to disassociate. But when it comes to thoughts, I find it's so rapid that it's really tricky to slow down that sort of like a tape. But that's just— but again, I think that's just one of those things that comes with practice, with noticing, with observing. But when I understood, or as I understand, this phenomenon that that things run at different rates, I kind of give myself a break when it comes to certain aspects of the practice. And then say, well, you know, I'm at a point where I feel like I've progressed to a point where I can, you know, with relative ease, not associate with these particular sensations or phenomenons. But when it comes to things like what you you're describing, Carl, things happen so quickly. It's a bit like what you were describing with the fire hose, that it takes a lot longer, I think, in general, to slow everything down and to recognize, okay, that's not part of, you know, that's nothing to associate with the I. Or whatever. I don't know if that was helpful.

**Speaker F:** It was.

**Speaker C:** It was. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Carl.

**Speaker H:** Hey.

**Speaker E:** Do you mind if I give you a little tip that I learned from Dhammarato recently?

**Speaker D:** Of course.

**Speaker E:** Okay, so something that it's been helping me too is that I forgot what it was.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** You know, maybe that was the tip to forget about it. There was something along the lines of that, to be honest with you.

**Speaker B:** A live demonstration.

**Speaker E:** I love it when this happens, honestly. I'm like, pretty great.

**Speaker I:** Great.

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker E:** Something to think about.

**Speaker C:** Thanks, man.

**Speaker H:** I really enjoyed that. It's a good tip for us all.

**Speaker E:** I don't know, I forgot.

**Speaker H:** Wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Robert, you had a hand up that went down.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, so I have two questions. The first question is for you, Dan, is can I vape in the Sangha?

**Speaker B:** Oh goodness, I had never even considered making any rules.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker B:** So I appreciate your respectfulness, Robert, but, uh, I still have no intention of making any rules.

**Speaker D:** Last time I was called Dhammarato, I took a couple hits on my vape. He didn't care at all.

**Speaker B:** By the way, I was cool with vaping. We're cool with vaping, Robert.

**Speaker E:** I wasn't poking fun or anything at you, mate. I just— just the synchronous, like, just You saying that, it just brought a laugh out of me. So thanks.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, that's fine. It's a pretty funny question. My other question is for Scott. He said something that I found really interesting, which was that when you're noticing the body sensations, if you identify as the linear thought process, it makes it easier to notice the body sensations. So my question is, if I'm trying to notice and disidentify from the linear thought process, Is it a good idea to identify with the body sensations? Like, does it work vice versa?

**Speaker D:** No, no, no, no. So like, it's like you played video games before, right?

**Speaker J:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker D:** So like when you first start at a video game, you're pretty like slow at it. Like you're pretty clunky. You're not used to like the rules of the game and the controls. So like you react a little bit slower and like you're going to lose in the beginning. Like, you're not going to catch the thoughts as they come. The point is not to identify it as another perception and go to it and disidentify from other perceptions. The point is to disidentify from whatever perception is arising in that moment. So it's like a video game where your reaction time gets faster and faster the more you do it. So it's like If in the moment it's a bodily sensation that's coming into awareness, you just identify from that. If it's a thought, from that. Sometimes there's not thoughts, sometimes there's not bodily sensations, sometimes there's not feelings, sometimes there's all of them at the same time. But the point is, like, going like getting them faster and faster, and at a certain point, like, it becomes like almost a natural, like, easier process because, like, And this way, same way you get really good at a video game, you just start to go into like flow state and just do it.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, like on autopilot, just like, yeah, mindful of it.

**Speaker G:** Yes.

**Speaker J:** Is disidentifying the same as being mindful, or is there like a second step? Like you notice it and then disidentify, or is it the same?

**Speaker D:** The noticing is the disidentifying.

**Speaker J:** So, okay, it's the same.

**Speaker D:** Notice it, you're seeing it, whereas before, if you think you are it, you're not actually noticing it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, because you are not anything that you can experience. So within putting it into your awareness that you're able to experience it, it kind of goes to show you that there's a separate— there's you there that is experiencing.

**Speaker B:** Well, indeed.

**Speaker J:** I don't need to like consciously analyze it.

**Speaker B:** You'll whittle it down until there's nothing left.

**Speaker E:** Say that again, Dan.

**Speaker B:** I said if you look hard enough, you'll whittle it down until there's nothing left.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, until you experience the experiencer.

**Speaker G:** That would be like Nirvana.

**Speaker J:** The flip into the witness, right?

**Speaker B:** It breaks down. Subject-object relativity breaks down.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, indeed, subtractive process. Yeah, it breaks down. You're seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing, making everything object. And I created a practice for myself around exactly this at one point, to take a snapshot of my entire experience. And then anything that I could see was of course object. So then I would look for the experiencer of that object. I would look for the subject. Well, if I can see that now, that's object. So I would then look again. Okay, where's the subject? Now that's object. And you keep going and going and going and going and going until— and again, it has this game-like quality. Scott, I loved your pew pew pew kind of like the sound effects, right? And Carl, I suspect that might be the key to what you might be missing right now is that game-like quality which is indeed gladdening the mind.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and honestly, I think kind of like comparing the path itself to a video game does make it easier because it's a great— yeah, yeah, because you're just trying to play the game.

**Speaker G:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** There's no seriousness in it.

**Speaker B:** And as soon as we look at it that way, it is that way, right? As soon as it becomes whack-a-mole, then Yeah, I'm down.

**Speaker A:** Played some like first-person, uh, shooter games again recently after a long time, and when I kind of snapped out of it, suddenly everything was like, holy shit, is this actually a first-person video game?

**Speaker F:** Well, yeah, that kind of experience of a first-person experience.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it got my attention earlier when you were talking about, about the world outside being like a movie. Yeah, is that so bad? I mean, great, cool, let's, let's call it a movie. Let's watch it as though it's a movie.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, let's enjoy that.

**Speaker F:** I like seeing it like that as well. Kind of like visual perception just being another screen.

**Speaker B:** I'm thinking about us all sort of grabbing bags of popcorn now and going wandering around outside.

**Speaker E:** Good work there, Officer. You found him, Detective.

**Speaker H:** What was he doing? No, he was vaping and eating popcorn.

**Speaker E:** Can I run something by you?

**Speaker F:** There's a lot of us.

**Speaker B:** There's loads of us. Yes, of course, Alex, you can run something by me.

**Speaker E:** So it's interesting today, you know, I woke up and I felt like the house of cards Anagami, whatever you want to say, just went away and was gone, fell down. And before when that would happen, there'd be like more reality to it. There'd be like, oh wow, like I'm fucked, I gotta call Dan, or I gotta take a breath, or I gotta do something. And I just like noticed that too. So I saw that too, and I was just like, all right. I'm just going to take it. I'm just going to enjoy these breaths right here. We're going to do a little reset. And I was able to feel good. And as soon as I felt good, I did not hesitate. I congratulated myself immediately. It's like, oh, great. All right. Feeling good now. And then, you know, it would— there'd be like some unwholesome thoughts there. And the unwholesome thought that has been more or less coming up in the past 24 hours is like, I don't know how to relax, or I can't relax now, or I don't remember what it is to relax. Whereas before, I would be able to like see the unwholesome thought and see all of the like doing of it, the doing of the thinking and like, oh, okay, I could just relax. I could just relax. And Yesterday, I think that's kind of like actually what took me out because I started to believe the thought. I started to believe the thought that I don't know how to relax. Well, at least I can see that, right?

**Speaker B:** So, so you can.

**Speaker E:** But I've just, I don't know, really honestly, I've, I kind of just came to like a surrender moment today where it's just like, all right, okay, I see it. You're looking for a standard, you're looking for practice to be the same way it was yesterday. You want things to be different than they are now. You want to feel a little bit better. This joy isn't good enough. And I was like, as soon as I saw it, I was like, okay, all right, this is good enough. This is good enough. This is good enough right here. And then of course, you know, there's the thought, well, is it really good enough? Or what happened to my practice? I'm losing my progress. No, no, no, no, there it is again. That's okay. Just relax from that. And it's just, it really is like, uh, it's a, it's like a fucker. It's a little fucker. It's just trying to fuck with you. And it's like, it's like, get the fuck out of here. Like, I know how to— I'm fine, I'm fine, okay?

**Speaker B:** I'm all right. Well, the benefit of us recording these calls is we can wind the clock back a month or two and compare this little fucker to where Alex was a month or two ago. And I think Alex will be pleased.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, and that's what, uh, that's true.

**Speaker E:** He comes back. Sure.

**Speaker B:** So you're right, that'll be a third spawn camper, Alex.

**Speaker D:** Spawn.

**Speaker B:** You gotta be a dirty spawn camper.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah. And it's like, it's interesting, you know, sometimes I'll just, I'll like let go completely. I was like, all right, that's it.

**Speaker B:** I'm done.

**Speaker E:** And then the next thought will come up. Oh no, you gotta do something. Oh, I'm done. And, you know, it just keeps, it can keep coming. And then in the moment when I least expect it, I'll be like sitting there on my toilet taking a dump and my eyes will be closed and there it all is. There's that peace, there's that tranquility, there's that like meditation. Everything's fine. Oh yeah, everything's fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so shitting meditation is in the suttas.

**Speaker C:** Really?

**Speaker E:** Wait, really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not sure if you can search the entire Access to Insight or Sutta Central, but if you search defecation, you'll find a passage on shitting meditation.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, there's a book called The Buddha Poops that you can buy.

**Speaker B:** BuddhaPoops.com.

**Speaker E:** So I just— I mean, Dan, I like— I've I feel like sometimes when I say things now, instead of like being hungry for a solution, I'm kind of like enthusiastically sharing the experience. I see what I'm observing. Yeah, but I guess what— that's great, thank you. Uh, but I guess like what I was looking for was just, yeah, I don't know, anything you could say to make it a little bit— how about a pat on the back?

**Speaker B:** How about one of these?

**Speaker E:** Oh, that'll do.

**Speaker F:** Well, I think that pattern recognition tip also applies to this, you know, kind of trying to see what it is that makes these thoughts arise. Because it is just a pattern, you know, your brain reacting to some stimuli.

**Speaker E:** Oh, yeah, I remember now. The other thing that I wanted to say is, Dan, I don't know if you remember, but before you went on vacation, I told you about how I was able to like see this thought as as like, as like just a belief. Actually, I was able to see the thought itself as just a belief in the existence of an I that's thinking this thought. And without that belief, it all falls down. Now, for a couple days, I was able to kind of like use that as a frame of reference. But I went back to it, you know, and like, I can't see it the same way that I saw it before. Some of those thoughts are Keep going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you had an XP boost for a couple days there. Now you're back to, back to the grind.

**Speaker E:** And, and yeah, the question would be, and obviously like the answer to this, so I'll say this, the question is, and then the answer to the question that I made, and we'll see if you have a better one, but the, the question was, is there, would you recommend keep practicing to get back to that place where I could see the belief and let it all fall apart from there, or just follow Dukkha, Nirodha, which in this moment, for me at least, would probably just be to relax. Because what I noticed through experimentation, when I kept going back to that thought and kept going back to that frame of reference, it was causing more Dukkha because it was like, oh, there's a job to do now.

**Speaker F:** There's something to get practice should ever be trying to go back to something that you had previously attained. You know, because then it's another form of chasing. You say, oh, I've experienced this before. Why isn't it here now?

**Speaker E:** Exactly.

**Speaker F:** You try looking for something that's not there, honestly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** And you know, that kind of clouds you from what is right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like you have to start again from scratch every time, right? Every moment is fresh. And so, Alex, you had the experience there of following that compass of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, and you used your compass to determine your practice.

**Speaker E:** I did. And I am. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's everything that you and I have been discussing these past months.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, rather than what Alex wants or what Alex craves or, you know what, I just like, nope, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Just going to relax right now. Yeah, right now. Yeah, this is good enough.

**Speaker F:** I think it's also important not to try to force a certain state of mind or a certain type of emotion, you know, like Yeah, every single sensation, every single experience is a good practice for insight if instead of focusing on the specifics of the situation, you know, you focus on the three characteristics of sensate experience, which is impermanence and then Dukkha and no-self. You know, every single sensation, every single experience is an opportunity to investigate further into these characteristics of sensate experience.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and I think the reason why this question arose for me, Ron, is because like that's something I'm very interested in, and I see the value and the benefit of that, because when it happens, when that clear seeing happens, it's like so stark.

**Speaker F:** It's like, holy shit, this is holy shit, incredible, holy shit moment.

**Speaker E:** The holy shit moment. But to your point, if I go on investigating and looking for that stuff, and that's causing Dukkha, it's probably best to just relax.

**Speaker F:** Because you have to realize that might have been a holy shit experience. But like all other experiences, it is impermanent, it will arise and pass away. You know, not— there's, there's no such thing as continuity almost, you know, it's just another experience. And when you try reaching back for it, you know, now you're starting to be picky about what you want to experience instead of just experience it regardless of what the context of your experience is.

**Speaker E:** So I guess like, how do we know when it's appropriate to just relax and appropriate to investigate?

**Speaker B:** And in a relaxed way, it's all right.

**Speaker E:** And I got to do one or the other. And that's kind of what I did.

**Speaker F:** Because sometimes you'll be relaxed and sometimes you won't be relaxed. But whether you are or not, they're both good opportunities to investigate. Whether you're happy or you're sad, those are both good opportunities to investigate. Whether you're angry or you're peaceful, you know, they're— well, no, no, no. Sensations.

**Speaker E:** I don't know about that because you're happy.

**Speaker D:** If you're happy, you're going to be too busy being happy. There's no need to investigate at that point. You need to investigate Dukkha. You don't need happiness as the answer to Dukkha. There's no need to. You just enjoy it.

**Speaker F:** That's why not investigate happiness? You know, if you investigate Dukkha and then you become happy and you don't investigate that You're like, oh, I've got to where I want to be. You're favoring one experience over another.

**Speaker D:** Oh, wow. I found happiness over Dukkha. That's my Anagami.

**Speaker C:** I got to be is another Dukkha, isn't it? Because you're claiming like you achieved the goal. I got to be happy. So let's investigate happy. There's just another Dukkha thought, isn't it? It's setting yourself up for failure. I got happy, so you're saying what I was doing before, why I was not happy before. It arises more questions out of investigating into that instead of just— it also implies an additive process as opposed to a subtractive one.

**Speaker B:** Happiness is what's left in the absence of Dukkha, as opposed to happiness being something that we construct and have to maintain.

**Speaker E:** And that's kind of why I asked when to relax, when to investigate, because of course, when I'm really relaxed, there's no need to investigate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it is kind of like— so it makes sense then why there'd be that confusion there. Yeah, but then still there is an importance to investigation.

**Speaker B:** So, well, investigation is a tool, right? And once we've— once we've built the house, we don't continue dragging the tools around. We enjoy the house.

**Speaker D:** Okay, now that still has— that still actually is an additive image, but I think you can all— yeah, that's another— it reminds me of, uh, so the investigation is like the thorn that removes the thorn. Yes, once you remove the thorn, you don't need the thorn that you remove the thorn with anymore. You get to let it go.

**Speaker E:** That reminds me, I don't know if any of you guys— I'm sure you guys could relate. I just would love to share this because this is just This is something I'm proud of. This is congratulations. But in the beginning of all this, a lot of the practice was much more regimented, like militaristic. Like, I got to notice the unwholesome thought, then I got to put a wholesome thought, then I got to gladden the mind. If I don't, I'm a bad boy. Oh, there's another unwholesome thought. And now it's more like Oh, I can, I can see the whole process happening and just after a while just relax, relax from the process. Like, oh, that's it, that's all right, no problem. Oh yeah, no, there's nothing to do. I know you think there's something to do, but we're good here. I'll just relax.

**Speaker B:** Exactly as we would expect. And, and Scott, you use the analogy of the video game, but indeed it goes for learning any skill, doesn't it? When we say we go for our first boxing lesson We're gonna be— okay, that's a pretty charged context, isn't it? Right, but then you look at Floyd Mayweather in the ring against another champion boxer and he's cool as a cucumber. Aikido, right? Rick can actually speak from experience here. What was your first lesson like, Rick?

**Speaker H:** It was painful.

**Speaker A:** I didn't know how to fall.

**Speaker H:** People were throwing me every which way and trying to explain how to like land safely, but I still limped away from that class and for the next 2 months until I learned how to properly fall. And that wasn't even the offensive part, that was just the defensive part, so to speak. So yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but then Rick, did you read Mastery by George Leonard?

**Speaker H:** No, I haven't come across that.

**Speaker A:** No, it's a book, it's a book, uh, not, not specifically about Aikido, but the author is an Aikido master and uses, uh, examples from Aikido, um, in, in the process of the book. And it's a real cool read, I really recommend it.

**Speaker H:** Okay, yeah, zap it in the chat and I'll check it out. I'm always interested to see how some of those principles apply, you know.

**Speaker B:** So the first Aikido lesson is painful.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, but it's also like a bit of an awakening too, because, you know, all of my previous martial arts skills were made pretty much useless. So it was a humbling experience. Experience at the same time because I had already been involved in striking arts for 15 years. They nullified everything I had or thought I had. And so that was a great experience to realize that, you know, here I am sitting at third-degree black belt in my school with 15 years of, you know, having run my own classes and everything, and then going in and just getting flipped around like like a fish out of water. And so it was phenomenal. It was phenomenal. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** That was something you guys have to understand. The first lesson is don't get hit. It's just learning the lesson that's painful.

**Speaker D:** Is that from dodgeball? If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.

**Speaker B:** It could be, it could be. So, so then many Aikido lessons occur.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And cut to Rick walks into— is it a dojo in Aikido?

**Speaker H:** Oh yeah, it's still a dojo. Yeah, they're still using Japanese.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I didn't, I didn't want to, uh, use the wrong term. Um, and now Rick is cool as a cucumber.

**Speaker H:** And even outside of the dojo, it's not necessarily when you step on the mat, but there was a couple of situations that I had to defuse using, I wouldn't say actual physical ability, but using more of the training in order to defuse some potentially violent situations and remain as cool quote, cool as a cucumber in the refrigerator, you know. And yeah, it worked out very well.

**Speaker B:** Good. Great. So, so there you have it, Alex. That's, that's the path that you're on. In the beginning, this skill is new and we're unskilled and there's a lot to process and learn. And then over time We relax. Dhammarato talks about the musicians, right, who in the beginning must have distraction-free dedicated practice time. Putting that new student in front of an audience out in the real world would be a terrible idea. They need that distraction-free private dedicated practice time where they can put their whole attention on being very deliberate. With what they're doing with the instrument. Then comes maybe they rehearse with other instrumentalists, but again in private, right? They're skilled enough now to start thinking about what other people are doing as they do what they're doing. Then they're ready to perform. And then finally, Dhammarato uses the example of Louis Armstrong, who is always seen playing. He's just playing as if with a toy, completely relaxed, always.

**Speaker H:** But I'd like to add something to that a bit. I would also say that it's important at whatever stage you are to enjoy it, whatever stage you are. Because, you know, and this is something that I learned early on in any pursuit that I had, was to not be anxious about getting to a level of mastery because once I arrived there, I knew that it wasn't going to be enough, quote enough. Instead, it was to enjoy the practice as a beginner or as an intermediate or an advanced or whatever, but at each stage to find that joy or enjoyment because then it didn't It didn't matter where you were on that, you know, in the line, and you weren't looking towards getting, "Okay, I'll be happy when." You won't be making that statement, "I'll be happy when." That's not even important. It's like, "I'm practicing, I'm happy." Boom, that's it.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Joe?

**Speaker I:** Rick, that just reminded me. I have a question. Like, as a language teacher, would you have tips for how, when learning a language, to be like, to enjoy it more at like kind of a beginner, middle stage? Because I find that, yeah, I'm not very skilled at this. Just from learning other skills in the past, I generally learned them by beating myself up into submission instead of enjoying them. So I wonder if you had any tips as a teacher.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, I'd say that one of the mistakes that a lot of language learners make as adults that children don't make is that they love— children love to copy what they hear. As soon as they hear it, they apply it almost immediately without any self-consciousness, right, about like how they're going to look. They're not worried about embarrassing themselves. But as adults, we don't want to look foolish or stupid or ignorant. And because language is by its necessity a communication tool, it's very easy for us to fall into that trap. So I suppose the way to enjoy it is to use the phrases as quickly as you can, even if it doesn't seem right. And oftentimes it will be— there's less of a chance, actually, there's far less of a chance of making a fool of yourself than there is to just having a good laugh with everybody. So I don't know, for me it's just about taking it and using it as soon as you hear it. Like, you know, and that way you'll not only increase your vocabulary, but you'll increase your enjoyment, and maybe you'll even surprise some people and yourself with what you're able to, you know, what you're able to say. Yeah, and I don't know, other than that, it's— you know, language is a little bit like collecting, but it's not just collecting, it's also about showing it. You know, not showing it off, but showing it. So it's a process of collecting and showing, collecting and showing, until it's already yours. You know, so I don't know if that helps at all, but yeah, I mean, that's the best way to gain gamify it. And again, children, they're like our best teachers because of the natural way that they learn languages. You know, until about the age of, I'd say, 9 or 10, and then we have to say, okay, what are they doing that we're not doing in order for it to seem to come so naturally to them? And one of those things is that they're able to speak without a lot of self-consciousness. They steal the language and they use it for their own rather than like just recording it down into a notebook and then like, okay, is this the right situation? Okay, I use it. No, um, no. It's like removing that, trying to remove those doubts. And even if you're sure it's wrong, say it anyway. Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, the mistakes are fine. The mistakes are fine. They're funny. And they're like, yeah, you know, a lot of people think that you're gonna say— you're gonna offend someone, but that's all in the movies. There's very little chance that you're gonna say a word or a phrase that's actually offensive to someone by mistake. That's the only thing.

**Speaker I:** They just laugh. Generally, they just laugh at you.

**Speaker H:** Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And if it's a game, they're really— then they're suddenly— they're laughing with you because you find it funny. To, rather than them laughing at your mistake. You're both laughing at the fact that you're god-awful at the language and you're still working on it. It's fine. And it's fun. So I don't know. That's my advice.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker I:** That's helpful. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Just in general.

**Speaker G:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** You go ahead, Joe. Okay.

**Speaker I:** I was just going to say, in general, I have trouble learning almost like any skill I choose just because like My parents described me from a very young age as like an anxious child, and I was always like the best student in the class that was like paranoid about ever making a mistake. At a very young age, you know, I was like planning my retirement account when I was like 8, you know. And like, so it's like a constant sort of like actually learning how to do something that from, I guess, from a very young age, of course, when you're 4, then it's not like this, but Even as a kid, my parents described me that I just wasn't a kid, you know. I was just that anxious kid who was like always perfect and always like had to be the best student and just like constantly studying, constantly trying to be the best at whatever I did.

**Speaker G:** Right.

**Speaker H:** You have to revel in the messiness that is language because it's all about— it's not even just about words, it's about meaning and context.

**Speaker B:** Context too.

**Speaker H:** And so yeah, a lot of it is just, you know, just getting down and dirty with it. It's great. It's great. It's a great experiment. It's a great chance to investigate. It's a great chance to communicate.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I just wanted to vouch for what Rick was saying. I've been doing a very childlike attempt at learning some Bengali with Debbie and her parents. I'll hear them saying stuff on the phone and I don't have a clue. And I'll just repeat sounds and her parents laugh without fail. It's always hilarious. You know, I don't know, I might be like starting halfway through a word, but slowly I kind of pick little bits up.

**Speaker E:** And then— Like a baby does, right?

**Speaker B:** Pronunciation is always wrong, but then, you know, Deb will correct me and I'll have fun kind of just— that I think we kind of lose the fun, don't we, of just making noises, right? You look at a really small child and they're— right? Because they're like, what's all this? What's— I got lips and a tongue and I don't know what they're called yet, but they've got all this hardware, and they're just exploring it, right? I spend a lot of time trying to encourage new drum students to just wave their arms around and see what happens. And sure enough, the kids are more likely to do that than the grown-ups, because the grown-ups have an idea that if they're a grown-up, they ought to already be good at what they're doing. Which is just absurd if you think about it, right? You go for a first lesson in anything and that assumption that you ought to somehow be any good at all is just crazy. And yet there's that inhibition, isn't there? And it's all schooling. It's all schooling that teaches us that. If it weren't for the way that school does their thing, we would retain that natural learning. Right the way through.

**Speaker A:** I sometimes make fart noises for fun.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Rick. What was that, Doug?

**Speaker A:** I just, I sometimes just make fart noises for fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, try that on the train. Right? I bet it will help.

**Speaker H:** It'll definitely give you the seat next to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you might even have to end up with an empty carriage.

**Speaker A:** Those are vacant anyway because of Corona, man.

**Speaker B:** Scott, you got a hand up.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, I wanted to circle back to something Rick was saying because It was very, very important. He was talking about how every stage, every part of the path should be enjoyed. So whatever part of the path you're on is the path itself. And so it's not as if we are meditating to become enlightened. The meditation is the enlightenment. So that's a very important point and something to keep in mind, whatever stage you're in. There's like tons of Dukkha, there's no Dukkha, whatever is going on.

**Speaker E:** All right, Alex, that's great, Scott.

**Speaker D:** Thanks.

**Speaker J:** I feel like it's a catalyst as well, like satisfaction, like whatever other technique you're doing, if you do it while you're happy, it's more effective.

**Speaker E:** So what I was going to say, we were talking about it earlier before Joe asked this question about the language. We were talking about how practice, the skill of practice changes, and I was curious if in your guys' experience, and you too as well, Dan, if the enthusiasm, the intensity of that enthusiasm changes at all. Because for me, you know, I remember like when I was throwing the axe, it was like I was playing, you know, it was like when I was a 14-year-old and in my sitting in my basement, it's 3 AM and I've been playing video games for 10 hours and I'm not getting up until I beat this boss battle. I'm having so much fun. It's exhilarating. I got Doritos and Mountain Dew next to me and I just can't wait. But like this, how it is now, is like, oh, okay, I see you, Berater. Oh, just relax. So there's like, there's an enthusiasm, but it's not like as much as it was before. And I think the unwholesome thought that's showing up for me now sometimes is like, oh, you, you gotta have more enthusiasm, otherwise you're gonna miss it. You know what I mean? And I know that's just an unwholesome thought too. So I was curious if that's kind of like the natural way of things.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I would say, um, follow your enthusiasm. So at any given moment, if you're like forcing yourself to meditate but you really rather be watching Netflix, go fucking watch Netflix, dude. Like, follow your enthusiasm. Like, that's gonna be more skillful. Like, that's gonna be more skillful than beating yourself up and like doing something you actually don't want to do. Because if you're doing something you don't want to do, like That's like almost counterintuitive to what meditation really is.

**Speaker E:** Now there is that, and I appreciate you saying that, but in the beginning there was, I don't want to do this.

**Speaker D:** But what I would be— Okay, let me counter that. It's like learning an instrument, okay? In the beginning, you're putting in effort, right? It's difficult to learn the instrument, but you want to learn the instrument. Yeah, it— you, you wouldn't be here if you didn't really want to do this. You would be in the world doing something else. So it may seem like at times— I'm not saying it's always— there's never effort, but it's an effortless effort in the sense that you really want to be doing it. Yeah, you're choosing to practice meditation.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I guess, um, maybe— sorry, I appreciate your guys' input. Dan, I think this question would be better suited to you because I remember when you, you told me specifically, you said the practice is enthusiasm, enthusiasm is the practice. And when you said that, I think something went off in my head as an interpretation, like, okay, enthusiasm has to look a certain way.

**Speaker B:** Oh dear. Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is one of those "you said" moments where the teacher starts to sweat.

**Speaker E:** No, there's no sweating over there, I'm pretty sure.

**Speaker B:** Hey, Nora. Hey, Nora, good to see you. No, I loved everything that Scott was saying, and I think that another way to say it might be that There are stages in this that we can point to in retrospect. And I think also, Alex, you're someone who has really thrown yourself at this, but it's always going to be contained in what Scott said, which is you did that because you wanted to do it. You were enthusiastic because you wanted to be enthusiastic. You, you bought my image of throwing the axe because you wanted to buy it. So it all— there's really no way to get outside of intention. It's a delusion really that we think that we can do something that we don't want to do. It's just not possible.

**Speaker G:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** It's the same as when people say be yourself. You can't get away from being yourself.

**Speaker E:** I think along the lines of more specifically what I mean is when an unwholesome thought shows up, right? The enthusiasm weeks ago would have been, oh yes, I got it! And now it's more like, oh, okay, good.

**Speaker G:** That's good.

**Speaker E:** Good to see that. I can just relax right now.

**Speaker B:** I'm failing to hear a problem here.

**Speaker E:** It's not necessarily a problem.

**Speaker B:** You want to get it right. Right, well, now your original question, if I recall, was, has the enthusiasm changed for each of us? Yeah, sure, sure. I mean, I struggle to find any two moments that are the same. Of course it changes.

**Speaker C:** It just became too easy for you to spot this. I mean, the, the curve level of your skill has gotten so good, it's like playing a video game that is too easy for you. But the levels of life will always change because it's cycling in and out. So you will have moments where you're going to be super enthusiastic to remove this Dukkha or suffering, or really enthusiastic about practice. But then there's going to be easy moments where you're just like, okay, that's at least how it is for me.

**Speaker E:** I got it. Thanks, guys. It just The same thing follows that after a while it's like, ah, just relax. Just thinking about this is Dukkha. Just asking about this, just talking about this, just wondering about this, you know, wondering if it's done right, it's just all Dukkha. So just relaxing from it and there's the practice.

**Speaker B:** You got it. And there's the smile that follows.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, Robert.

**Speaker J:** I can't remember.

**Speaker E:** I'll be right back, guys.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Good shit, guys. That's some tasty Dharma.

**Speaker J:** Yummy. I have it. I have a different question, but other people have their hands raised. No, go for it. Okay, this was from ages and ages ago that I just didn't get a chance to like say, but it was about self-inquiry. Um, I know there's a point where you're supposed to sort of like— the mind is supposed to come like focused and stable, and then you're supposed to like switch your identification from the ego to the, like, the object of, like, the observer, and then you become, like, this, like, witness that's, like, empty of content. But I've tried to do that, and at different stages it'll have, like, more or less emptiness. So if I have a very refined object and I, and I make the switch, I will have a very empty sensation of the witness, of being the witness. But if I have a less refined, less stable object and I make the switch, there will be like more of a quality to the witness. It will be less empty. It'll still be like kind of more me. And my question is sort of like, should I keep doing the self-inquiry to the point where like it reaches like this like sort of perfected level before I even try to make the switch? Or is it okay to try and make it when I feel like I'm just satisfied satisfied with noticing, noticing, or— So here's the classic misunderstanding that was in the very words of your question.

**Speaker D:** Okay, you don't become the witness. You are already the witness. Going to become a witness, how is that possible? Like, at what point do you switch from not being the witness to being the witness?

**Speaker H:** When you take the stance.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, that's like a weird split.

**Speaker D:** The thing is that it's not something that's going to be added, like you're not going to, oh, start that in the future, so at some point you're going to start abiding in awareness, or like whatever self-inquiry is to you in your mind. No, no, no. It's not something that needs to be added. It's something that needs to be subtracted. So all that needs to be done for the witness to recognize itself is to stop believing not to be the witness. And that's something that you do.

**Speaker J:** I see.

**Speaker E:** In other words, just keep noticing Just keep noticing, Robert, and gladdening the mind. And, you know, one thing that I picked up recently is I don't care. I don't care. I don't care about what Alex wants, what his point of view is, what he says. I don't care if he wants sex. I don't care if he wants this food on the menu. I don't care. He's just going to enjoy whatever. Like, that's it. Dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. And you'll start to see that, like, that stuff just really doesn't matter. And thinking about that stuff is dukkha too.

**Speaker J:** Um, I have, um, I have a— my other question, I remembered what it was, was that Scott said if you want to do Netflix and like that's what you're drawn to, like watch Netflix instead of meditate, you should go ahead and do that because it's what feels natural, a little what make— a little what make you happy now. But my question is, if someone's like really addicted to watching TV, like for example I'm really quite addicted to scrolling Instagram and that feels very natural, like very often, but then I wouldn't get the value of doing like more formal meditation practice. Is it a good idea to like become sort of an ascetic or like a lay version of an ascetic where I'd like not have access to the Netflix at all so that that's not an option rather than— and then I wouldn't have the— do you know what I mean?

**Speaker C:** Depends if that causes you more suffering, like if not having it causes you more suffering, then— but it doesn't, like it does.

**Speaker J:** I guess, yeah, but then I get— I do more meditation naturally.

**Speaker C:** But then eventually meditation might be causing more suffering because you're neglecting your other part that is telling you like, okay, I might want to relax from meditation and to sink in into myself. While meditating, you're just practicing concentration and concentration if you're doing like long sitting sessions. It's really for you to answer for yourself. If you notice Dukkha when you're meditating, or you're trying to run away from Dukkha by meditating, that's another thing that I fell into a lot. I would spend like 2-3 hours just sitting, running away from my problems a lot of times.

**Speaker J:** I used to do that a lot. I'd meditate for like really long hours in the morning because doing anything else was kind of like a bit dull and effortful, whereas meditation, you can kind of just sit there and chill out, or lay down in my case.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. We try to escape like a lot of our reality that we're not comfortable with, and that's just Dukkha. We're not the mind and we're not spotting the Dukkha. We're just actually secluding ourselves from it with meditation.

**Speaker J:** But okay. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Robert. I really appreciate you sharing all that, man, because I see so much of habits and patterns that I've recognized within myself and what you just said. So you talk about like, should I do this? Should I do that? I've even like done a form of that on this call. And you're talking about like, should I become a layperson? Or should I be more at it, like full force power? Well, I think a better question that might give you relief, actually, hopefully, is, am I satisfied right now? Can I be satisfied right now? Start like paying attention. You know how Dhammarato says like, we pay attention. Like, if you imagine currency, we pay attention to these thoughts of thinking and wondering and hoping and expecting and futuring. And then we also could pay attention to, am I satisfied right now? No? Okay. Wow, great. I can see that. Congratulations. Let me take a breath. Your focus is like Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So dissatisfaction and the cessation of dissatisfaction. Any amount of cessation of dissatisfaction is worthy of celebration, to be congratulated. As soon as you can remember, as soon as you see it, and then relish in that, savor that. Who cares about laypersons? Who cares about becoming full force power, you know, Dukkha Destroyer? Who cares about all this stuff? Oh, I'm just gonna enjoy enjoy being here right now. Oh, but I can't enjoy being here right now. Oh, but I can enjoy this breath. Oh, that's a congratulations. I can congratulate myself that I can see all of this. Oh, yes. I can congratulate myself for being grateful for all this. Ah, yes. And you will be more naturally interested in that rather than all of this. Should I do this? Should I do that? And start seeing those thoughts— should I do this, should I do that— as Dukkha is taking you away from wholeness.

**Speaker J:** Thank you, that's really helpful. Yeah, I get really caught up a lot in— and I think Ron points, or Scott might have pointed this out in the chat before, or no, it was Joe actually— which was like the meditation maps and the models and stuff. And because it's just like, it can just become another form of like just thinking about the past and the future instead of like focusing on what I'm doing now. Yes, thank you.

**Speaker E:** Yes, yes. And every time you notice that you're focusing more, even you could use that as your big milestone congratulations right now. Every time you notice that you're more focused on enjoying being here right now, right there, that's congratulations. Even if you're not enjoying it, well, I have my attention on it though.

**Speaker F:** That's better.

**Speaker E:** I'm destroying Dukkha right now because of that. Look at that.

**Speaker G:** No.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I understand, brother. I really do.

**Speaker J:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to add that, um, well, but you just described it kind of as an addiction, the— what was Instagram stuff, spending a lot of time there. And I'd say that if you already describe it as an addiction, that there is already a substantial amount of Dukkha in it, in a way, as with every addiction. And I think it could be fair to say or to see if we can kind of, at least kind of, make a little subtle distinction that can be helpful, because when we're kind of following our addictions, it's not something that we necessarily really, really really want, would want to do at that moment, but rather something that's so habitual that it might not even serve any purpose anymore. And I think to circle back to the distinction that Scott gave quite a while back was more, if we can if we can sense that it's a bit more maybe genuine. I think we can all agree that when we are attentive and we investigate a bit, we can most of the time see whether something that we thought, that we think we could do now, or that we think we're going to do now, if there is more of a force of kind of habit behind it, or a force of this is actually what I do now. Hi Alex.

**Speaker B:** Hi guys.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think this distinction might also be helpful there.

**Speaker B:** That certainly sounds like wisdom to me. Indeed, if we're already describing something as an addiction, I think we know that it's is Dukkha. There's at least some Dukkha showing up some of the time, at least when we do those behaviors. And maybe there is a payoff as well. We're not going to do anything unless there's some kind of benefit in that cost-benefit equation. But then a lot of those things, there's also Dukkha. And Robert, you just described that actually you can quite happily sit and be satisfied for long periods of time. And so of course there's no cost to that. That's what's so great about practicing Dharma, the karma that ends karma. No cost, all benefit. Yeah, yeah, that's an interesting kind of— there's, there's, there's an interesting kind of subtext to any conversation like this, which is that to say to someone who's addicted to crack, do whatever you like, is terrible advice. There is the case where someone needs intervention, but that's not any of us.

**Speaker F:** Can I say something about this?

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker F:** So I just wanted to add on based off of my own personal experience. I've come to see that telling yourself that you're addicted to something and that you have to stop it is another form of Dukkha within itself because you will still do it, but you'll feel bad about doing it and tell yourself that you need to stop.

**Speaker B:** I've got that a lot.

**Speaker J:** I'll just keep scrolling and I'll be like, I need to stop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Like you're living in the past or the future. Like, you know, I've told Dan this. I used to have serious problems with marijuana and nicotine. And, you know, I would tell myself, oh, I'm addicted. I have to stop. And you know that telling myself that would make it even worse. And on New Year's, I decided to quit everything cold turkey. Just to see how it was. And in that, I came to realize, you know, sometimes I would be in a position where it was right in front of me and I would want to do it, but I would tell myself, no, I quit, I can't do this anymore. And I would have a type of internal battle with myself. And, you know, I wouldn't really— it's not like I was always constantly thinking about doing it, but when it was right then and there, you know, or if I was with some friends, I would want to, and then I would fight with myself. And I came to realize for the most part, you know, the body is going to do one thing. And then when you don't think it's what you should be doing, your mind is going to argue against it. So instead of trying to fight with yourself, simply be aware of what it is that you're doing right now in the present moment. And if you are doing it, ask yourself, do I want to do this right now? Or am I doing it because it's what I'm used to doing? You know, because— right.

**Speaker G:** And then the reason— what was that?

**Speaker B:** And then the most powerful way to change the cost-benefit equation, which perhaps in a kind of status quo can keep us going back to those behaviors that we deem to be an addiction, The best way to change that cost-benefit equation is to raise our general level of satisfaction, as opposed to trying to discipline ourselves out of whatever behavior we deem to be naughty. Yeah, sorry, we just learn to be satisfied without— go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, no, I was just gonna say, you know, let's say you just spent 3 hours scrolling on Instagram, right? And you put your phone down, you're like, damn, I shouldn't have done that. I'm addicted to Instagram. But at that point, it's already, it's in the past, you know, you're, you're scolding yourself on something that has already happened. You know, because if that thought arises while you're scrolling on Instagram, you can simply just put your phone down and then problem solved. You can tell yourself, I don't want to do I don't want to do this right now.

**Speaker C:** Can I say something on that, on the topic of addictions? I find it like that unless you dissolve the sufferer, the sufferer still exists and he clings to these addictions. As for me, when I experience like my addictions, it's not necessarily— it's like I can see them clearly and I can see what I'm doing, but I can see my choices, I can see that I'm choosing to feel this way, I can see that I'm going into myself, I even see the traps set for myself throughout the day to fall into these addictions, but yet I still choose that. So there's some kind of clinging to the sufferer that we're not dissolving completely that manifests in those behaviors. At least that's what I found out recently. If you're still suffering, you still have a part of yourself to dissolve. I don't know if that makes much sense, but to me— No, you're— No, it makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker J:** DJ, it doesn't make that much sense to me, but I feel like there's something there, like, in it. Like, I could probably relisten to it in a bit and get it. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** See ya. You have something to add?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm still working, so I can't be with my camera on all the time. But yeah, something about these addictions Like I've struggled with some of them myself also with this cell phone stuff. Well, there's a great quality about awareness that I love that it's like you can celebrate yourself about being aware. And when you're aware, you can already start doing something about it. Like, okay, I know I spend a lot of time on cell phones, so I get to do something. Well, doing something is the way out of it, you know, like, yeah, what can I do? And sometimes you just want to be there, like, I just want to lay down and be on myself. And then, well, just be down, be with yourself, like, what's the problem? You're enjoying it. Well, just be there. But when it starts to like, oh man, I like being in the cell phone so many times, and oh man, I really got to do something else, and well, Just ask yourself, there's something better you can do in that time, like, or if you can just chill and be on the cell phone, like meditation itself, like I'm just gonna be there and lie and relax and chill and just browse Instagram, just browse Reddit for a while and be there, watch some videos, like there's a phrase about this, this old man called Aleister Crowley that said, do what thou wilt, like whatever the hell you want to do, man, you know, like whatever makes you happy. So that's like my way out of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Well, indeed, there's a little confusion around the word happiness often, right? So the advice, do what makes you happy, is great when we're talking about what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa called the second kind of happiness—contentment, satisfaction, Sukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha—as opposed to the kind of happiness that is fleeting and comes from chasing things, getting things, being things, doing things, having things. Right, so we can see very clearly that it tends to be the case that scrolling Instagram is that worldly kind of happiness, right, where we're all sure that what we're after is that.

**Speaker F:** It's the serotonin, the dopamine. Freedom. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And it's not that dopamine is bad, right? So this isn't about smashing our phones up, never going on social media again, right? We can enjoy all of those things. But I like the idea of playing with them. So Robert, you might run little experiments. Right? What happens if I don't do Instagram for a day? Let's find out. It's a fun experiment. What happens if I do a 24-hour Instagram-a-thon? Let's find out. I did that yesterday. That's hard for me. Right? And, you know, like the classic, isn't it, is the parent who discovers that their child has been smoking cigarettes and makes them smoke a whole pack and they throw up and they don't want to smoke again, right? Maybe you'd have an experience like that. Maybe you wouldn't. Maybe you'd, uh, maybe you'd hear some really good Dharma on Instagram, right? Because, because that's, that's something to think about as well. I bet you're following some, some Dhamma accounts on Instagram, right? So mixed bag, here we are again, right?

**Speaker J:** Yeah, that's true, that's true.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's a good point, DJ.

**Speaker E:** I know you had a hand up, like 6 hours. Yeah, I was going to add perhaps a little reminder too, is like, yeah, when you're on Instagram and that thought comes up, oh, I should be meditating, right? I know this is kind of a classic thing, but just coming back, taking that deep breath and being like, okay. And maybe after a certain amount of those breaths, it'll be like, oh, okay, maybe I don't really need, you know, the Instagram right now. I'd rather get a little bit more seclusion, but either way, you know, it's coming back to the breath there. And so the seclusion sessions and getting out of it isn't like built up to be this like massive thing. Oh no, I should be meditating right now. I shouldn't be on the thing. It's like, oh wait, I recognize this. The breath comes in and there's that. If you know, but I'm sure you were doing a little bit of that there on and off, right?

**Speaker J:** Yeah, yeah, I was, I was like kind of meditating in the background, and obviously like if I'm doing Instagram, it makes it a bit easier to meditate because it's like kind of providing like dopamine, like, like Ron said, like it's sort of stimulating me, so I have less hindrances already.

**Speaker B:** That's an interesting way to think about it. Instagram meditation. Why not? Yeah, guys, this is delightful. Yeah, I'm gonna go now. Great to meet you who are new this evening. Uh, I don't know if you're new to Dhammarato in general or if it's just that we haven't crossed paths yet, but, but Scott, great to meet you. I don't know who else remains. It's kind of like Skype will give me so many people on screen and then some people are just icons in the top. So anyway, Fucking great to hang out with you all. I really enjoyed this call.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, this was really helpful, really helpful advice, Dan. Thank you very, very much. Bye, Dan.

**Speaker B:** Good to continue, of course. Go on and talk till the sun comes up. All right, lots of love, guys. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) and involving several Sangha friends, is a rich, practical discussion about applying Buddhist meditation principles to everyday challenges, fear, and the nature of mind. Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Themes & Teachings**

1.  **Meeting Fear with Investigation & Practice:** A major focus is on how to work with intense fear and anxiety (exemplified by Speaker A's traumatic train journey). The key teaching is to **frame difficult experiences as opportunities for practice**, not just as suffering to be endured. The advice is to start with smaller, manageable challenges to find the "middle way" between too little and too much.

2.  **Disidentifying from Experience:** A central practice discussed is learning to see all phenomena—body sensations, emotions, and especially thoughts—as **mere objects in awareness**, not as "self." The goal is to subtract identification, not to add a new state. As Speaker D puts it, "The noticing *is* the disidentifying."

3.  **The Role of Gladdening the Mind & Enthusiasm:** The practice must be **enjoyable and gamelike** to be sustainable. The enthusiasm naturally evolves from a fierce, effortful "throwing the axe" stage to a more relaxed, observant "just relax" stage. Every stage of the path should be enjoyed for itself.

4.  **Dukkha → Nirodha as a Compass:** The fundamental instruction is to use dissatisfaction (**Dukkha**) as a signal, and its cessation (**Nirodha**) as the guide for practice. When you notice suffering, the practice is to find relaxation or gladness right there. Any cessation of suffering, however small, is a cause for **congratulation**.

5.  **Skillful Practice vs. Forced Asceticism:** The group cautions against turning practice into a grim, regimented duty or using meditation to escape life. The advice is to **follow genuine enthusiasm**. If you'd rather watch Netflix than meditate grimly, watch Netflix. The practice is about increasing general satisfaction, not white-knuckling through addictions or creating internal conflict.

### **Key Dialogues & Insights**

*   **Speaker A's Fear:** He describes a terrifying experience where life felt like a "movie" in a vast, frameless space. The teaching he receives is to **investigate the need to "grasp" or have a "reference frame"** at all. He is praised for his clarity in observing the fear even while experiencing it, which is seen as a sign of strong practice.

*   **Carl's (Speaker C) Struggle with Mind:** Carl finds it easy to disidentify from the body but hard to do the same with thoughts. The insight offered is that this is often a **head-knowledge vs. heart-knowledge gap**. Thoughts are just another type of tangible sensation appearing in awareness. The solution is to apply the same "noticing" to thoughts as to bodily sensations, and to cultivate the **game-like, gladdening quality** of the practice.

*   **Alex's (Speaker E) Evolution of Practice:** Alex shares how his practice has matured from a militaristic "notice unwholesome thought, insert wholesome thought" routine to a more fluid **"oh, I see that... just relax"** approach. He learns not to chase past "holy shit" insights, but to use the Dukkha-Nirodha compass freshly in each moment.

*   **Robert's (Speaker J) Questions on Addiction & Technique:** Robert's questions about social media addiction and self-inquiry lead to important clarifications:
    *   **On Addiction:** Simply labeling a behavior an addiction and fighting it creates more Dukkha. Instead, **raise your baseline level of satisfaction** and investigate in the moment: "Do I *want* this, or is this habit?"
    *   **On Self-Inquiry:** You don't "become" the witness. You **cease identifying with everything that is *not* the witness** (i.e., all objects of experience). It's a subtractive process.

### **Practical Metaphors & Advice**

*   **The Video Game:** Practice is likened to a game where your reaction time to "see" phenomena as objects gets faster and more fluid, eventually entering a "flow state."
*   **The Fire Hose:** Don't drink from a fire hose of phenomena. **Control the valve**—start practice with smaller challenges.
*   **The Drowning Swimmer:** In overwhelming fear, you can't swim upstream, but you can make small, skillful choices to "grab a branch"—like focusing on the breath or congratulating yourself for a moment of awareness.
*   **Learning a Skill (Aikido, Music):** The path mirrors learning any skill: beginning is clumsy and effortful, but with practice, it becomes relaxed, joyful, and integrated into life.

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**

The talk embodies a **supportive, non-dogmatic, and experiment-based approach** to Dhamma. The emphasis is on personal investigation, sharing experiences openly within the Sangha, and finding a joyful, relaxed path through life's difficulties. The ultimate message is that **the meditation itself is the enlightenment**; every stage, with its unique challenges and joys, is the path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used throughout the talk to illustrate the practice and challenges of meditation and insight:

### **1. Journey & Travel Metaphors**
*   **Train/Car Ride:** Speaker A uses his difficult train ride as a direct metaphor for a challenging meditative or life experience, a "practice" journey into anxiety and fear.
*   **Baby Steps / Short Journeys:** Speaker B suggests starting with "short journeys, small journeys, maybe not so far from home" as a metaphor for gradual, manageable practice increments.
*   **Middle Way as Experimentation:** The process of trying "not enough" or "too much" to find the right balance is framed as finding the "middle way" through experimentation, much like calibrating a journey.

### **2. Water & Flow Metaphors**
*   **Drinking from a Fire Hose:** Used by Speaker B to describe being overwhelmed by phenomena, contrasting it with the need to "slow things down" and control the "valve." This is a metaphor for sensory or mental overload.
*   **Drowning Swimmer / Rapids:** Speaker B offers this vivid image for Speaker A's experience: a swimmer who can't swim against the current (the overwhelming fear) but can still exercise some control by "direct[ing] the body to grab onto a branch." It represents finding agency within surrender.

### **3. Art, Performance & Skill-Building Metaphors**
*   **Learning a Musical Instrument:** Speaker B (and later others) uses the progression of a musician—from distracted, deliberate practice to playing effortlessly like Louis Armstrong—as a metaphor for the path of meditation from effortful practice to natural, joyful abiding.
*   **Video Game:** This is a major, extended metaphor introduced by Speaker D (Scott). Practice is likened to a video game where you start "clunky" and slow, but your "reaction time gets faster and faster." Unwholesome thoughts are like enemies to be spotted ("pew pew pew"). The goal is to reach a "flow state." This metaphor is used to explain disidentification and to encourage a playful, gamified attitude.
*   **Whack-a-Mole:** Speaker B extends the game metaphor, comparing the process of noticing and releasing thoughts/identifications to the arcade game.

### **4. Construction & Tool Metaphors**
*   **Building a House / Using Tools:** Speaker B describes investigation as a "tool" to "build the house." Once the house (understanding, peace) is built, you don't need to carry the tools (constant intense investigation) anymore. This is contrasted with an "additive process."
*   **Thorn Removing a Thorn:** Speaker D uses this classic Buddhist metaphor to describe how investigation (the first thorn) removes suffering (the second thorn), and then both can be let go.

### **5. War & Combat Metaphors**
*   **Fight / Battle:** Speaker A initially describes his experience as "a fight." The language of "freaking out," "getting my ass kicked," and "ordeal" frames the internal struggle in martial terms.
*   **Spawn Camper:** Speaker B uses this video game term (a player who kills opponents as soon as they appear) to describe the persistent, annoying nature of unwholesome thoughts that Alex (Speaker E) is dealing with.

### **6. Movie & Illusion Metaphors**
*   **Life as a Movie:** Speaker A describes the experience of life as "like a movie happening within... Bhavana space." Speaker B later encourages him to lean into this: "great, cool, let's call it a movie. Let's watch it as though it's a movie."
*   **First-Person Shooter Game:** Speaker A makes a connection after playing a video game, seeing the parallel to first-person conscious experience: "holy shit, is this actually a first-person video game?"

### **7. Other Key Metaphors & Analogies**
*   **Head-Heart-Gut Knowing:** Speaker B references Adyashanti's framework to explain Speaker C's (Carl's) disconnect between intellectual understanding ("head") and direct experience ("heart/gut") regarding the mind.
*   **Pattern Recognition/Execution:** Speaker F (Ron) uses the analogy of the mind as a pattern-recognition and execution system to explain why disidentifying from thoughts is so hard—we identify with the habitual reaction pattern itself.
*   **Leaf Blown on the Wind:** Speaker B uses this to describe the feeling of powerlessness when one believes phenomena have total control over them, contrasting it with the clarity of "seeing all those sensations as object."
*   **Boxing / Aikido:** Speaker B and Speaker H (Rick) use martial arts training as a story to illustrate the progression from painful, awkward beginner stages to skilled, effortless mastery, mirroring the meditative path.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract meditative concepts (like non-grasping, disidentification, investigation, and the path to mastery) more concrete, relatable, and understandable for the group. They provide shared imagery to discuss internal states and the process of practice.
