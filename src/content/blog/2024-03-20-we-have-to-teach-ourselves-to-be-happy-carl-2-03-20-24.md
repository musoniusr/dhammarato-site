### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I feel since I started to practice Anapanasati and really got into your wholesome approach to the Dhamma, it's been really helpful. I was coming out of quite a difficult period and I really got into the practice, but the last couple of days I had some major— let's say I felt really unsettled. And really, so I couldn't really get into the wholesome thought patterns. And this is what I wanted to ask you about, you know, how I can— is it just trying to get at it, keep at it? And or, you know, when you feel those hindrances, you can't really you know, you can't really get out of it, you know, like Dark Night of the Soul almost, you know.

**Speaker B:** So go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm just, you know, I wanted to hear how is it just, should I just be keeping at it or, you know, when I really get into that kind of traffic jam with Mara's I can't really expel Mara's thought patterns, and how should I approach those?

**Speaker B:** Well, the way that we have to understand it is that, first off, most people are dissatisfied almost all the time, and only occasionally, when something happens that they like. But that doesn't last long. An example would be, I remember when I was helping a Thai buy a car, when I was in the robes, and that the salesman, while we were filling out the paper, I think it's because he was trying to sell us something, he says, "Aren't you excited?" As if that's how you're supposed to buy a car. All joyful and excited because you're getting something new. And I told him that being excited is not the right way to buy a car. You need to look at what you're doing. Okay, so most people in fact go from one dissatisfaction to another with only occasionally having elation that is short-lived. So when we start practicing the Dharma, that means then that we're actually finally in control, that we don't have to buy a car or get a present or have something delivered or get a raise or any of the kind of stuff that makes people feel good and start to feel good because we're actually able to do that. Without having to have some outside circumstance. However, that too is going to be short-lived. Yes, because why? Because the habit patterns of the mind has kept a person in dissatisfaction almost constantly, and that's his normal state of being. So whether he gets elation and happiness from the outside or whether he's creating it from the inside, it's still temporary.

**Speaker A:** Temporary.

**Speaker B:** But the point is, is that the, um, the things that happen, the elation on the outside, are unusual and rare. Yeah, but the one that we can practice on the inside, we can actually cultivate that and make a habit of it on its own, right? We have to keep practicing and keep practicing over and over and over again because our normal state of mind is things are not right. And we can start to practice over and over again by having the mental attitude that things are okay. We can have the mental attitude and the mental words of everything is all right, everything is fine, and pretty soon we begin to feel that way.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. And it really, it was really fantastic. I mean, really I was so surprised to see how well it works and, you know, how really kept me in a really good— while my outside is still has been kind of messy, it's still, you know, I could still face it.

**Speaker B:** The outside is going to be messy as long as you continue to have the attitude that is messy, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. But nevertheless, it's been fine, you know, it's really been. And I, I have been really keeping at it and really encouraged. But then I had a few setbacks this week And it's just somehow this whole negativity just came over me and I was really feeling unsettled. Before it's been so easy to kind of just put you in the wholesome frame of mind.

**Speaker B:** Well, what you can say, now you can see that and you can say, aha, I see that messy mind. Aha, I can see that I have gotten back into that funky state. And then you can do something about it. The problem is, is that people will move from one funky state to another funky state without having full realization that they can do something about it right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** But it just be able to recognize.

**Speaker A:** But I remember, I've been hearing you so many times with your example of the email, you know. But unfortunately, I did send that email yesterday. I couldn't wait, you know. I was so unsettled, so I did send that stupid email. But hopefully I can maneuver it because today it's much better, and you know, I don't think it was too harmful. But you know, it was funny because I was like, later in the day, I was like, Wow, how could I? You know, I should have waited because I went outside. I sat under a tree. Then I slowly got back, you know, and got more wholesome. And towards the end of the day, I was feeling much better. And, you know, we can handle this. But I had sent that email.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wonder I should wait. Yeah, don't send an email when you're unhappy.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Because it will be returned to you unhappy.

**Speaker A:** Of course. Well, they haven't even returned it yet. Well, I think it's just my— but it was like, it was a pure Mara email, you know. You can feel it when you're— it's really ridiculous. But.

**Speaker B:** Um, yes, if somebody sends you an nasty email, don't answer it. Don't answer it. Wait a while. Wait a day or two and think about all the good things that you can say. And it'll be mixed with a bunch of garbage, but eventually when you do write it, you don't— it's going to be all sunshine, even if it's ironic. I mean, you could put the little ironic digs in there, but they've got to be happy ironic little digs rather than telling them what you really want to say. Yes, like calling the old woman a Karen. Don't do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, it's more of, um, it's, it's like, you know, in the professional, uh, you know, I'm, I'm working, uh, for, um, it's like a pro bono work, so I'm not being paid, but they're, you know, they're, they're asked, they're pushing me to do things, and then I was waiting for a job offer, which I— that was one of the reasons that I was a bit disappointed. And then these people who is pushing me to do this, you know, pro bono, or just— I got a little tense with them yesterday. So because, you know, I'm doing it with, you know, like— and so I'm gonna try and take a step back and, and, you know, uh, now be more, uh, you know, be more, uh, kind to them, you know.

**Speaker B:** Uh, although kindness goes a long way.

**Speaker A:** They'Re pushing, they're pushing my button sometimes, you know.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, well, they're pushing your buttons because you put them out there to be pushed. If you hide them away, then they can't push them.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. And it's so easy, you know, but it's just because that was another thing I was thinking about your, this Anapanasati. Does it come to when you're really wholesome in your practice and you actually, you can manage externals very well, that once you fall out, that these externals become even stronger? If you kind of start hesitating, or if the external factors become even more than they would otherwise be, you know, do you see what I mean? If you become so strong in your practice, so once you're suddenly, you start hesitating, then they appear much more difficult than they are. You know, like you become weaker against these forces.

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, you're beginning to see how weak you were with all of those forces all along. Now you're beginning to see that you feel really weak. You feel like that victim that you have always been. But now when you recognize that victim, then you can say, wait a minute, I can do something about that. That victimhood that I'm experiencing is just an old feeling, but I can choose not to feel like the victim. I'm the winner here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** So when you feel victimized, recognize that you don't have to feel that way. Remember, in fact, that when you're feeling victimized, remember that that's just a feeling you have. Whether they were trying to victimize you or not, it's irrelevant. If they were trying to victimize you, you let them do it. You put your buttons right out there, and that email victimized you. Or they weren't trying to victimize you at all, but you went ahead and let them push that button anyway. Yeah, so whether they're trying to victimize you or not is irrelevant. What's relevant is, is that you can't remember that you've got a choice about whether you're going to let them victimize you or not.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it's, it's like, uh, if you see these, um that these kind of outside or these external forces, when you're in a really good shape, you kind of— you don't bother now so much about them. But it's almost like when you lose balance, then you suddenly see them as even bigger hindrances, or, you know, they become more imposing, you know. So I was wondering if that's common in the practice when you're getting in shape. Like falling out of shape, then the hill becomes much steeper than it really is because you kind of been— you're, um, you've been renouncing— or not renouncing, but you're kind of— you haven't been bothered with them. And then suddenly when you're letting them in, they become much bigger, right?

**Speaker B:** We make them bigger. We conceptualize them to be bigger. We perceive them to be bigger. And the reality is that they're just real. Yes, and we can see real as just real, then that reality becomes a paradise all on its own because that's your attitude, that this reality is nice. But our whole culture has just been training every child in it that you don't live in a paradise, you live in a jungle, and you've got to fix things while they're, uh, while they're broken. Tote that barge, lift that bale. The next thing you know, you'll land in jail. That's from an old movie. All right, we've got to go, uh, to do what we're told to do. Learn your ABCs, learn your 1-2-3s. Pick up that, uh, pick up your toys, clean your room. And we're taught that way through the people that were around. Our moms and our dads are unhappy, and they teach that unhappiness to every child that comes along. We do not teach our children to be happy. We teach them to be unhappy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're so conditioned, huh?

**Speaker B:** So we have to start to teach ourselves to be happy.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker B:** And because you're not going to get it from anybody else, and you can, but you have to practice it over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because all of those— that time, because of all that education, now we are talking ourselves into feeling bad. We've been talking ourselves into feeling bad all of these years. Now it's time to start talking ourselves into feeling good. But we only do it a little bit a day, so we need to start building that up, practicing more and more until we can spend most of our time feeling good and only occasionally feel bad.

**Speaker A:** Right, well, that's how it's been, you know. I've been waking up sometimes with almost small like sparks of bliss after, you know, the wholesome practice. And my situation has still been messy, but I haven't, you know, I've been really on guard. I haven't been escaping into drink or anything like my old patterns. It's been really smooth sailing, really. But, you know, I still had challenges, but I've been handling. But then yesterday, or the two last two days, been things that previously was fine seemed overwhelming, you know. And immediately I kind of snapped back. And but I guess going out in the forest and, you know, I was collecting some firewood and stuff, it really— that helped actually. And sitting under a tree and, you know, I listened to some of your talks and There was one in particular where, because my father passed away quite recently late last year, and that's also been a little bit tough of course, but I listened to a really nice talk you had with one of your students or one of your friends about the passing of his, like how to deal with grief. So going outside in the forest and, you know, that kind of, that also balanced things a lot. So that was appreciated. But yeah, it's interesting how from having these challenges you can really deal with them. Suddenly they overwhelm you.

**Speaker B:** You know. But, um, well, Carl, I'm glad to hear that you're actually beginning to understand the Dhamma. The one thing that I can't actually keep emphasizing it is that you have to do it over and over and over and over again. Every one of us kind of thinks somehow or another that if I practice enough, I don't have to practice anymore. And that's not the case. And in fact, those who become extremely accomplished at it keep practicing, keep doing it. One of the examples that I would use is Arthur Rubinstein, who was a very well-accomplished pianist, and he was even an old man during my lifetime. And in the 1990s, he was in his 90s. And there was an interview, and the interview asked him, "Do you still practice the piano?" I mean, he was long beyond his prime. He was doing big piano concertos and traveling the world in the 1970s. But in the 1990s, what he said was, "If I miss one day's practice, I'll know it. If I miss two days' practice, the housekeeper will know it, and if I miss 3 days practice, the dog will know it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So if we need to be practicing our Anapanasati, if we miss a day of it, you'll notice. If you miss 2 days, your wife will notice. If you miss 3 days, the whole world will know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so we have to keep doing it, we have to keep practicing. Is there's never a time when we stop practicing, but there comes a time when we really like it. And so it becomes the easiest thing to do, is to just to take a deep breath. Wow, everything is so good. Yeah, no, everything is all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world.

**Speaker A:** All right, but there are also moments when I couldn't even— eventually it came back, you know, because I kept practicing yesterday. But there were times during the day when I couldn't get into that, even I tried to take the— tried to stop everything.

**Speaker B:** Well, never mind, start again, just keep going.

**Speaker A:** Like Mara was attacking me from all sides, you know, it was a Mara punch-up.

**Speaker B:** When you want to be happy and you're practicing to be happy and you're not happy, you're actually creating that unhappiness by wanting it. Instead of saying, this is good enough. Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever I've got right now, that's good enough. That's the correct way to practice. Practicing satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** That is, that is a good word. Good enough.

**Speaker B:** It's good enough. Yeah, right now is really good enough.

**Speaker A:** Even if it's not perfect.

**Speaker B:** Nothing is perfect. Well, in fact, the worst thing in the world is to have a perfect wife.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the worst thing is having a pity party, and that was— I was wallowing, you know, and it's pathetic.

**Speaker B:** People will have a pity party when they're practicing Anapanasati, or they think that they are. But why? Because they don't feel as good as they want to. 'Oh, poor me, my Anapanasati is not working as well as it did yesterday.'.

**Speaker A:** Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Instead of, 'Oh, never mind, I have— I saw that negative thought. I saw that. I saw that, Mara. Never mind, I feel good enough. This is good enough. Let me take another deep breath and I'll feel good enough again.'.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, but don't send that email just yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, don't send that email until you're in a really nice state. Yeah, yeah, yeah, when you can thank them for sending the email that you sent them, that they sent you, when you can say, wow, I'm so glad I got that email, you've really helped me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's really pathetic because you can actually create so much further mess by sending that, you know, by acting on your pity party.

**Speaker B:** So keep practicing, keep practicing, keep practicing being satisfied. It is good enough even when negative thoughts are there. Yeah, I see those negative thoughts. That's okay, I'm still good, I'm still okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, I, um, you keep practicing satisfaction, pretty good, pretty soon satisfaction is nice. Wow, I'm so glad that I could be satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. And it's been really, Dhammarato, it's been the— it has really been doing all the difference, you know. But it's also— I want to acknowledge when, you know, when there— when the negativity suddenly takes over, it takes over big time, you know. And, and that's, yeah, we just have to work with that as well.

**Speaker B:** Well, keep at it. Yeah, keep going. Call me again soon. Call me when you feel bad. Call me when you feel good.

**Speaker A:** I had another thing regarding the— if I may— regarding last— our call on Sunday. We were talking about the practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and how people come to the walk broken.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what it's for, it's a hospital.

**Speaker A:** But I was thinking, isn't— well, something that struck me, isn't— don't we see when we come to the Dharma that the kind of the normal— how things are is broken, like the Samsara, the Samsaric way of how life, how people live this life, it's kind of broken. So the ones who go to the Wat are actually trying to do something about it. So they're less broken.

**Speaker B:** Well, in a way, and in fact this is the idea that you can think of, is that the Wat is kind of a do-it-yourself hospital. All the gods and all the pills and all of the sutras and all of the hospital equipment is right out there. If you want something, go do it. If you got a broken arm, go set it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that was my point, that of course we are kind of broken, you know, that when you go to the Dhamma center or the— you're— but I mean, at least you're doing something about it. Like, a lot of people are just keep on with their house on fire and they don't want to. They just want to go up and down and, you know, well, a lot.

**Speaker B:** Of people will come to the Wat wanting somebody else to fix them, and nobody's going to fix you. They're having too much fun if they're practicing correctly. And if they're not practicing correctly, they don't know how to fix you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** So you got to do it yourself.

**Speaker A:** You got to do it yourself. You're right, and it's possible.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, of course. It depends upon your attitude. If you have the attitude that you can do it, then you can. If you have the attitude, oh, I can't do it, I need that guru to do it to me— Guru's not going to do it.

**Speaker A:** We have to see our own.

**Speaker B:** Up to you. And the attitude that maybe the guru can help you with is the attitude of you can do it, you can do it. Use the guru as example. Yeah, he can do it, I can do it.

**Speaker A:** No, it is, it is. And that's why I want to, you know, in really such a balanced, like really it's really been working, but it's, I wanted to bring up that, you know, there could be these, when these things come over you, you know, it's, but it's still is possible to get back into shape. Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** They don't come over you, you pick them up. And smear it all over you. But we've got to— those things actually have no power. We smear our own face and say it came over me. That's ignorance. When we realize that, yeah, we smeared that crap all over ourselves, now we could do something about it. The first thing that we decide to do— we're not going to do that right now. Yeah, let's clean our face.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's, let's try and, you know, we can get towards the top of the mountain of shit, you know. We don't need to have it, you know. We can, can get on top of it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, actually there's an important point about that, and that is that we don't need to climb a mountain. It's not a mountain that needs to be climbed. It's not a mountain, it's this moment. Can you climb on top of this moment? It's not a mountain.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I like that, right? On top of this moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, on top of this moment. And we think that there's a whole mountain of moments ahead, but no, you only have one moment at a time. They don't come as a mountain.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because when you're defeated by these moments, it's because you're not really taking it on. You're kind of— you're somewhere else, wallowing in some future scare or some past scare, or— right, you think that this.

**Speaker B:** Is part of a mountain when in fact, no, it's just what's happening right now, and you can take control over it.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So it's the mentality of that, that I'm not up to the case, then this moment is a mountain because that's the mountain that you've created with your attitude. When you create the attitude, oh, it's just a moment, I can fix this. So when you have anxiety, you can say, ah, I see that anxiety, let me take a deep breath. The anxiety is still there, another deep breath, and then in a moment or two, and that anxiety is gone.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** But if we keep worrying about whatever it was that we were worried about, then the anxiety will increase and increase and increase until we're having a panic attack. But if we can change our mind and see that anxiety— oh, look what I've done to myself, I've gotten myself into anxiety— let me take a deep breath and relax. And then that anxiety Sati will just go away.

**Speaker A:** Yes, because actually I was going, since our first call, I was going to ask you about when during my practice that my kind of, I had been feeling not unsettled or anything, it's just been stagnated, you know, not really enthusiastic, kind of bland. But then last couple of days I had this really negativity, so I wanted to discuss that instead. Rather than the blandness of the practice.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's just, you know, one negative thought after another. Can you see it? Say, wait a minute, I can change that right now. I don't have to continue to do that. I can stop doing it right now and start feeling good instead. This moment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Never mind that I've just had a mountain of moments where I feel bad. This moment is a little one, and I can feel good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. And, and go— and, and going outside and sit under a tree is good as well. It works, right?

**Speaker B:** Trees are good friends.

**Speaker A:** No, it's, it's really, it's really true. And, um, uh, yeah, there was another thing I wanted to check also. I, I noticed that, um I think there were some opportunities for volunteer work. Do I write, who do I contact.

**Speaker B:** For those things in the— You can contact Michael. In fact, Michael's right here on the porch.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. So I just write him on Skype or?

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, on Skype, okay? You can contact Michael Clarke or we have an open Sangha Foundation website.

**Speaker A:** Group. Are they posted there?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Are they posted there?

**Speaker B:** Uh, well, Michael is, uh, monitoring that group. If you want, I'll add you to that group.

**Speaker A:** Well, I— okay, I did register on the Open Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you, you've joined the Open Sangha Foundation as a, um, as a member of the, of the foundation? That's great. That's one of the first things to do. Make sure that you fill out all the data. The more data you fill out, the better. Put a picture up, put a photo, put your address, email, all of that kind of stuff is needed. And also, I'll post you on the Open Sangha Foundation website on the Skype group. And you can talk to Michael there. Thank you for your willingness to volunteer. We certainly have stuff for you to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I have, uh, I have some spare time now, so it could be a good, uh, thing. I just want to see what, uh, what the opportunities there are regarding— I think he mentioned something about social networks and stuff like that.

**Speaker B:** So yes, we have social net— we got all kinds of data that needs to be fixed, vetted, added to, and all that kind to stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, good stuff then.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Anyway, so Dhammarato, thank you so much, and I'll call you soon again then.

**Speaker B:** We'll see you then.

**Speaker A:** Okay, have a great day.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a practitioner (Speaker A) who has been diligently practicing **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and cultivating wholesome mental states, but recently experienced a strong setback—a wave of negativity, unsettledness, and reactive behavior (like sending an unskillful email).

Here is a concise summary of the key Dhamma points discussed:

### **Core Teaching: Cultivating Satisfaction is a Continuous Practice**
1. **The Default Human Condition:** Most people live in a habitual state of dissatisfaction, punctuated only briefly by external pleasures. The Dhamma practice is about learning to generate inner well-being *independently* of circumstances.
2. **Practice is Repetitive & Never-Ending:** Just as a master pianist must practice daily to maintain skill, we must continually practice cultivating a satisfied mind. The goal isn't to reach a point where practice stops, but to reach a point where we *enjoy* doing it.
3. **"Good Enough" is the Key Attitude:** The antidote to frustration in practice is **contentment with "good enough."** When you feel practice isn't "working" or negativity arises, don't crave a perfect state. Instead, acknowledge, "This is good enough for now," take a deep breath, and begin again. Craving for a better feeling *creates* the unhappiness.

### **Dealing with Setbacks & Negativity ("Mara's Attacks")**
*   **Recognize Your Agency:** Negativity doesn't "come over you"; you unconsciously pick it up and smear it on yourself through old mental habits. The crucial step is **recognition**: "Aha, I see this messy/unhappy mind." This awareness is the power to change.
*   **You Are Not a Victim:** Feeling victimized by people or circumstances is an old pattern. Remember you have a choice: you can hide your "buttons" so others can't push them, and you can choose not to identify with the victim feeling. The external trigger is irrelevant; your response is what matters.
*   **Don't Act from a "Pity Party":** When unsettled, **do not send that email** or make important decisions. Wait until you've returned to a wholesome, balanced state. Acting from negativity creates more mess.
*   **Use Simple Remedies:** Step away. Go sit under a tree. Go for a walk. Listen to a Dhamma talk. Take deep breaths. These actions help break the cycle of negative thinking.

### **Reframing the Practice & Perspective**
*   **Moment-to-Moment Mountain:** We imagine our problems as a huge mountain to climb. In reality, we only ever have **this present moment**. You don't need to climb a mountain; you just need to get "on top of this moment" by choosing a skillful attitude right now.
*   **The Dhamma as a DIY Hospital:** The Sangha or Dhamma center is like a hospital for the broken, but it's a **do-it-yourself** hospital. No one can fix you; they can only encourage and exemplify that *you can do it yourself*. The tools (teachings, practices) are provided, but you must apply them.
*   **We Teach Ourselves Happiness:** Our conditioning teaches us dissatisfaction. Dhamma practice is the counter-training: we must deliberately and repeatedly "talk ourselves into feeling good" until it becomes the new, dominant habit.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a compassionate yet pragmatic reminder that the path has ups and downs. Setbacks are not failures but **learning opportunities** to see our old, unconscious patterns. The solution is always the same: **gently but persistently return to the practice of cultivating satisfaction, right here, right now, with an attitude of "good enough."** Keep practicing, keep recognizing, and keep starting over.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key metaphors and stories used by **Speaker B (Dhammarato)** to explain the Dhamma practice and mental training:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Traffic Jam / Mara's Thought Patterns:** Speaker A describes being stuck in negative thoughts as a "traffic jam with Mara's." This frames hindrances as obstructive, chaotic forces that halt progress.
2.  **Buttons Being Pushed:** Speaker B says, "they're pushing your buttons because you put them out there to be pushed. If you hide them away, then they can't push them." This metaphor externalizes emotional triggers as physical buttons we control the visibility of.
3.  **Smeared Crap / Cleaning Your Face:** Speaker B refutes the idea that negativity "comes over you," saying instead, "we smear that crap all over ourselves... now we could do something about it... let's clean our face." This is a vivid metaphor for taking responsibility for our mental state and the ability to cleanse it.
4.  **Mountain of Shit / Mountain of Moments:** Speaker A mentions getting "on top of the mountain of shit." Speaker B refines this, saying **"It's not a mountain that needs to be climbed... It's not a mountain, it's this moment. Can you climb on top of this moment?"** This crucial metaphor shifts the perspective from an overwhelming, long-term struggle to a manageable, immediate one.
5.  **The Wat as a Hospital / DIY Hospital:** Speaker B states, "it's a hospital," and later clarifies it as a **"do-it-yourself hospital"** where all the "tools and pills" (teachings, practices) are available, but you must use them yourself. This contrasts with the expectation of being "fixed" by a guru.
6.  **Victim vs. Winner:** Speaker B contrasts feeling like a "victim" with choosing to see yourself as the **"winner."** This metaphor frames the internal shift from passivity to agency.
7.  **Good Enough:** This is a recurring conceptual metaphor. Speaker B advises practicing the attitude that **"this is good enough"** as an antidote to perfectionism and the craving for a different experience, which itself creates suffering.
8.  **Pity Party:** Speaker A admits to "wallowing" in self-pity, calling it a **"pity party."** This metaphor trivializes the act of indulging in negative stories about oneself.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Buying a Car Story:** Speaker B recounts helping a Thai man buy a car. The salesman asked, "Aren't you excited?" Speaker B replied that excitement isn't the right way to buy a car; you need clear-minded attention. This story illustrates how society conditions us to seek fleeting external elation rather than steady internal clarity.
2.  **The Unhappy Email:** This is a central, cautionary tale referenced by both speakers. The lesson is: **"don't send an email when you're unhappy. Because it will be returned to you unhappy."** It's a practical story about not acting from a state of Mara (hindrances) and the karmic consequence (a negative reply) that can create more "mess."
3.  **Arthur Rubinstein Story:** Speaker B tells the story of the famed pianist in his 90s. When asked if he still practiced, Rubinstein said: *"If I miss one day's practice, I'll know it. If I miss two days' practice, the housekeeper will know it, and if I miss three days practice, the dog will know it."* This story powerfully emphasizes that mental practice (Anapanasati) is a lifelong, daily discipline essential for maintaining well-being, not a one-time achievement.
4.  **Cultural Conditioning Story:** Speaker B describes how we are taught from childhood to be unhappy: "Learn your ABCs... pick up your toys, clean your room... We do not teach our children to be happy. We teach them to be unhappy." This story explains the origin of our default state of dissatisfaction.
5.  **The Perfect Wife:** In a quick, humorous aside, Speaker B says, **"the worst thing in the world is to have a perfect wife,"** underscoring the danger of perfectionist thinking and the attachment to ideals that cause suffering.
