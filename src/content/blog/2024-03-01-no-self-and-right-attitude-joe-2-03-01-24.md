### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Now, uh, let's make a long story short, and I'm willing to go into the long story if you want to, but the word that the Buddha used, anatta, did not translate and does not translate to no-self. And so anybody who says that it does simply do not know the Pali and don't know what they're talking about. The word atta is used as an example of Mahatma, Mahā-ātā, Gandhi. Do you know what Mahatma means?

**Speaker B:** I know Maha means great. I don't know what the rest of the word means.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it actually means great soul. It does not mean great self.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Okay. Did you mean to turn off your video?

**Speaker A:** I can't see you.

**Speaker B:** Did you mean to turn off your video? I can't see you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll turn it off and back on, and that should clear it right up. Do you see me now? Okay. All right. So starting back again with the problem is the issue of the word self. Versus soul, because a soul has a definition and self is very loosely defined. And the soul has a definition of something that is eternal, that is everlasting, and is affected by things but still never changes. And who you are is who you are. Who you are the moment before you die is the same person as the one after you die, whether you go to heaven or hell or wherever. So if you wind up in heaven, it's the same person who died, right? That's the definition of the word soul, and it does have a whole lot to do with consciousness. And that the Buddha teaches that because consciousness is temporary— like, for instance, you go to sleep at night, you lose consciousness. And the one who wakes up in the morning is not the same consciousness that goes to sleep at night. That in fact, when you're listening to something, that's hearing consciousness. And when you're seeing something, that's seeing consciousness. And consciousness moves around. It's not permanent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And yet the Christians and many others around the world equate Who I am with consciousness, because I am conscious. All right, now to use the word self for a moment, we can understand where the Buddha is coming from in the sense of selfishness, that when we really believe in a self, then we react or respond differently than if we were thinking that the self, or who I am, is not important. All right. And so the self is actually changing a lot, just like consciousness is changing a lot. But soul doesn't change. Yeah, it can clean up its act, but its act sticks to the soul, and the soul is permanent, long-lasting, everlasting, strong enough to survive death. And the Buddha says there ain't no such thing, but what we do have is times when we move around from being selfish to being not selfish. And when we are selfish, we are subject to suffering, Dukkha. And when we're not selfish, then we don't. An easy example of that is, brother comes and wants to borrow $500. If I say, "Oh, I can't afford $500, I don't have it," say no, then he feels bad and I feel bad. But if brother comes and asks, can you borrow $500, and say sure, here's the $500— why? Because I don't care about the $500. I'm good without it. So he's happy and I'm happy. So when I get selfish about my $500 then we both suffer. Neither one of us gets what we want. And in fact, I don't get what I want because when he wants $500, I want to keep my $500. I don't want to let it go. Or more still, I want another $500. Yeah, he wants $500, so do I. And so in fact, this is a state of liking and not liking, or wanting and not wanting, in this case money.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So if you can understand that, then that should clean it up completely. There is no permanent self. The self that you have arises and passes away and arises and passes away. And when it arises, you don't like things or you want something. And when it passes away, you're okay. When you're not thinking about yourself, you're okay. When you're thinking about what you want and what you want to do and da da da, that's when we're disappointed, we're dissatisfied. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Does that clear up the issue of self? Or do you have more questions about it? Because it's actually a fairly easy concept once we understand that the Buddha taught against soul. Not against self.

**Speaker B:** Oh, and any— yeah, I mean, what I meant was like my, uh, like there's— well, practically speaking, there's less, much less referential self thoughts and preferences, and like it feels a little bit weaker, at least for just for this, you know, the last couple of hours that this experience has been occurring.

**Speaker A:** Well, good. Let it melt away. When you say weaker, what I hear you saying is, is that you spend fewer thought moments establishing it and mocking and packing it up and making it important. And when we stop thinking about myself—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it felt like a relief, right?

**Speaker A:** What a relief to stop being so selfish all the time.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** What a relief it is to not care about what happens to me.

**Speaker B:** Except now I care that it's going to come back, and I don't want it to come back.

**Speaker A:** Well, the thoughts— that's selfish. You don't want it to come back. It's going to come back. When it does, what you want to in fact, um, let us say, spend our time on in development is that when it comes back, you can catch it before it does any damage and throw it out before it does any damage. So begin to see the selfishness as it comes up so that you can throw it out and come back into a state of safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied. That in fact, almost always the self comes up in a sense or presence of danger. The self is not safe. That's why the instinct is called the self-preservation instinct, because there's an instinct inside that says, "Danger, danger, danger, Will Robinson!" Actually, it's me. When you feel danger, that's the self. That feels the danger. Or in fact, it's the self that's in danger. And so when we practice feeling safe and secure and comfortable, that means that the self is no longer important, because that's the only thing that's in danger. It's a self-preservation instinct. Now, when kids are— let us say the bully comes down the hallway at the school and the child, the 14-year-old skinny kid, becomes afraid. The reality is that it's unlikely for the bully to kill him right there on the spot. The reality is that there is really nothing to be afraid of because the bully is coming.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was actually just about to say that I would be afraid of the pain associated with death, but then I realized what you're saying is if I just take out the 'I' part, then the rest of it kind of collapses.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the rest of it kind of collapses. That pain is pain. When that guy over there is having pain, the doctor's okay. And in fact, here's a question for you, just as a kind of a teaser or a joke. Have you ever actually, let us say, witnessed a real autopsy?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I mean, I've cut up bodies myself. Yeah. They're not fresh, but they're not fresh.

**Speaker A:** Okay, they're embalmed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay, so, uh, there is in a movie— the movie is called Dead and Loving It, and it's, uh, uh, a Mel Brooks movie, and it's about Dracula, and, uh, Leslie Nielsen plays, uh, Dracula. But in there is a scene where they do an autopsy, and Mel Brooks plays the doctor. And he delights in having all of the student doctors in the room watching him do a live autopsy, and every one of them faints. That's his intention. OK, here's the point, is that when a student doctor is looking at an autopsy If he puts himself in the position of him being the corpse, him getting his chest cut open, him having his ribs moved out, him having his heart pulled out, that's when we faint. But if you can see that autopsy in the sense of it's just a piece of meat and it's not me, Okay, then there's no problem. So it's when we identify things. Here's another example, all right?

**Speaker B:** Republicans— we not identify with anything?

**Speaker A:** Is that— we can identify with anything. I'm about to talk about identifying with a political party.

**Speaker B:** No, no, I'm saying can we just not identify with anything?

**Speaker A:** Can you? Well, that's the process of learning to identify with less and less stuff. Because anything that you identify with is going to cause you discomfort. An example of that is saying somebody's having blood drawn, and when the person who's having the blood drawn is interested in the needle, interested in what the nurse is doing, interested in watching the blood go into the vial, he's got no problems with that drug being drawn. But when the person who's having the blood being drawn is interested in me getting stuck with the needle and my veins are being played with, that's when there is pain. And that's when people have trouble. In fact, at one time I used to pass out when they would draw blood. Now it's easy peasy, nothing to it. Why? Because I don't identify with being the one who's getting stuck anymore. I'm interested in the procedure.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker A:** That's selfishness. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I think, yeah, I understand what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** All right. So we can do that with a political party. When somebody identifies as being a Republican, then anything that happens bad to the Republican Party, they hurt. And anything good happens to the Republican Party and they feel good. Right. Same thing with Democrats, same things with nationalism, same thing with tribalism. Anything that we identify with, when it goes up and down, we go up and down too. But if we don't identify with anything, like having my blood drawn out of my arm versus there's just a procedure going on, watch what the nurse is doing. When we have the autopsy, when I'm just watching the autopsy going on, but when I have thoughts of me on the table.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what I was curious about is in— I guess I don't remember the sutras, which ones, but the Buddha would mention like suchness or like reality as it is. What is that referring to? Is it just like the sense contact?

**Speaker A:** Like, basically, yes. The reality is what we see. The reality is what we hear. The reality is what we touch. The reality is the posture we're in, in the sense of proprioceptive. The reality is in the taste of the food. And let us say the taste of pepper on food, prik, little peppers that they have in Thailand, or jalapeños that they have in Mexico, the taste on the buds of the tongue are the same for people in the Northern Klyan and the people in Thailand. But because it's a new taste for the ones in the North and they've never had chilies or they don't like it. But the ones who have had chili in their food on a regular basis, they like it. So liking and not liking has nothing to do with the sensations or the actual reality. It has to do with what we're used to.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So reality or thusness or suchness is the taste of the chilies on the tongue. But the Vedana is whether, oh, that's so spicy, oh, it's hot, oh, I don't like it, as opposed to yum yum, that's good.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so there's— okay, that part makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so suchness is reality, thusness is, well, how things are, and We process that reality, and the processing is called perception in English. And we perceive things based upon not just the input that we're getting right now, but we process that data based upon old experiences, old data. So, okay, the Thai guy who's had the data of that chili's over and over and over again, and he knows what it is and he's used to to it, he's going to process the data of that chili differently than the guy who has never had chilies before. And so he's going to process it all— this is brand new, all this is strong, oh, I've never had this before, oh, my mouth burns. Okay, and so our experience then— by the way, in the Pali, the word the experience itself is called salyattana. Now the Atanā is the actual senses, but we process what comes in from the real senses through our past and through our old knowledge and through our habits and things like this. And the Pali word for that is Samskara. And then we come up with an experience, and it's that experience that contacts us and causes feelings, not the actual input data. The thusness or the suchness is not what impacts us and causes feelings, it's our perception of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, I understand.

**Speaker A:** In that case, that means that we can change how we process input.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can change how we process input. For instance, if you— if the guy who has your chilies and never had them before, if he starts eating chilies one after another every day, he has something dish that's got chilies in it, in a month or so he's going to like chilies. He's gotten used to it.

**Speaker B:** So something that I've heard other— I've heard people talk about, but I haven't personally experienced, is kind of a feeling or an experience of being the same substance, or like this somehow connected with all of reality. Yeah, I personally have experienced But that's not it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a perception. It's an experience of perception. It's not actual data input. For instance, the eyes only have shape, colors, and movement, and all the rest of it is, let us say, processed. So process in the form of facial recognition. So you see a face, maybe a loved one, and now you feel all warm and gushy inside as if you were connected to the entire universe because you see a photo or an actual person and you recognize their face.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So what are they referring to? The fact that like causally everything is interconnected and like nothing is separate on its own? Is that what it means?

**Speaker A:** Well, the actuality, of course, you get a good scientist and start to question him about it and he'll say Yeah, that we have very basic things. We have electrons, protons, and neutrons. Those can be broken down into quarks and things, but science has actually found out that things are really, really simple. So water is water because it's H2O. Water is water everywhere. And yet we look at a river and we see it's brown or it's yellow or polluted or it's salty or whatever like that. And we say water is not water because dirty water is not drinkable water and salt water is not drinkable. So water is not water. But the reality is, is that water is water.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so if you begin to start understanding and seeing things that way, let's go back to the chilies. I was about to talk about that a little bit more. The guy, in fact, has chilies in everything that he eats. He may not like it, but he has no choice about it. Let's say he's in prison. In Mexico or in Thailand, and all the food that he ever gets has got chilies in it. And he can go for a long time telling himself he doesn't like chilies, and so it will then be very slow for him to start liking chilies because he keeps telling himself he doesn't like them. But if he gets clued in, he can start saying The second, the third, and the fourth time that he eats, "Oh, chilies are not so bad. Oh, I like them pretty well." Then it's not going to take him 30 days, it's probably only going to take him a few days to get used to the chilies, and he wants to like them, so he starts liking them very quickly. That's what Anapanasati practice is about, is let's start liking the chilies. Whatever reality is served to us, if we begin to like it and enjoy it, because it's going to keep coming, you can't— you don't have any choice over reality very much. But you do have a choice over how you feel about it.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I have an incomplete understanding of Anapanasati practice, but what my understanding of it is like meditation on the breath, or like a series of meditations on the breath. What does that have to do with the chilies?

**Speaker A:** It has everything to do with the chilies, okay? That in fact, most people don't care about their breath. They don't have anything to do with their breath, and they let the breath be, let us say, normal breathing, which is probably not as good as natural breathing. And now they're starting to practice Anapanasati and having good thoughts about the breath, that the breath is relaxing. So the breath in this case now is exactly the same thing as the chilies. It depends upon our attitude about the chilies, and it depends upon our attitude about the breathing. Because you're going to keep breathing anyway, one way or the other. Why not breathe well enough so that you're getting the body energized, You also know that as we breathe out, that we actually remove a whole lot of pollution. Most of it is carbon dioxide, but carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is an acid, a carbonic acid. And people get uptight when they don't have enough oxygen. And so, by intentionally breathing well, we actually energize the blood, energize the body. So somebody, let us say, sitting in meditation and they're getting into a dull state, if they start breathing well and thinking about their breath, they can actually energize the mind, wake the mind up. Now, here's another point that's really important, and that is, most of the experiences that people have in meditation that they call deep meditation is actually because the body is not getting enough oxygen, the brain is not getting enough oxygen. They go into a dull state and that's when they start dreaming. They come out of that dreamy state and think that it was magic. At the severe end of it would be, oh, they saw a light and they followed the light and there's old Grandma sitting there and Grandma says, "Go back." Okay, you're talking about a near-death experience, right? Okay, so that's what happens when people sit in meditation, is that they get so starved for oxygen that they begin to actually get close to death. But if we can continue to breathe because we're breathing consciously, then we're going to stay awake and alert, and we can then have happy thoughts about being awake and alert, and those things register better. Than they would if the brain was half-starved for oxygen, as well as— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was gonna ask if you recommend using sitting meditation to like develop the habit of making the breath pleasant or like thinking good thoughts about Is that what— would you recommend that? Or like, what would you recommend?

**Speaker A:** I would absolutely say that that would be part of a correct practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Changing the thoughts that we have from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, learning to control the breath, because if we can learn to control the breath at a steady rate, we can also learn to control our mind. We can learn to control our feelings. Most people are completely out of control with their feelings. Whatever comes up, they're it. It's even built right into our language: I'm angry, I'm frustrated, I'm sad, I'm hurt. And the fact is that no, they are not hurt. No, they are not angry. No, they are not frustrated. They just have the feeling of being frustrated. The frustration feeling. But they can change that, not being owned by it. But most people, because they're out of control with their feelings, whatever feeling comes up, they just follow it along. That's who they are. They identify with their feelings just like they identify with the political party, or they identify with Chili's. As being for or against. And so we stop identifying with the thoughts. Instead of saying, oh, this is my thoughts, then in fact, one of the things that I have commonly said to students when they bring up the topic of what I teach is not mine. I learned all of this stuff. I haven't had an original thought since I was in diapers. Everything that I've ever learned, everything I ever knew, was not invented here. It was taken in through the senses, processed and stored, and then reproduced. It's all learned behavior. It's not original manufactured.

**Speaker B:** Are you saying that babies have original thoughts then?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the baby thoughts of goo goo ga ga, every one of them starts with their own thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And all the rest of the thoughts after that are learned. Okay. For instance, the little kids who— go ahead, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was going to ask, like, what other components would you say, like, a good practice should, like, maybe not should, but like, what would you recommend that a good practice have?

**Speaker A:** Well, we can go right to the Satipatthana, the four foundations of Sati. We can go with the body. So breathing actually helps us to experience the body, and that will help us then to relax the body. And relaxation is better than being uptight and full of tensions. Wouldn't you agree with that? Okay, so that's part of the goal, is to having the body relaxed. All right, feelings. Feelings are normally in two different realms. One of the feeling realms would be associated with fear. Fear brings anxiety, anger, frustration. Grief, guilt, all of that stuff has the component quality of fear. And then there are feelings that are associated with non-fear, and that would be happiness, joy, elation, satisfaction, relief, relax. Okay. And all of those have to do with non-fear. So the basic point then is that we're going to learn to control our feelings so that there is an absence of fear. And we can talk to ourselves into feeling safe and secure, recognizing the reality, the suchness, is that right now you're safe. Right now, most of the people in the world are safe right this very instant, and yet many of them are full of fear, or at least having anxiety, tensions, and worries. But they made all that stuff up. The reality is that there's nothing there. Here's an example, would be that someone will see a snake, maybe a cobra, on YouTube, and they'll become afraid. The reality is that it's a picture of a snake on YouTube. It's not a real snake. Okay, so most fear is, let us say, wrongly brought up because of the way that the children were wrongly brought up. They were brought up to fear things, and therefore they will find all kinds of things to be afraid of. But we can practice being safe, we can practice feeling safe. And how we do that then— so we've got the body being relaxed, the feelings feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and relaxed, and satisfied, and successful. Elated. And then we have the mind in its mind states. And mostly there are two different kinds of mind states, just like two different kinds of feelings. The two different mind states are: are you a victim of your surroundings, or are you the boss, you're the winner, the champion? Are you in charge here, or are you still a victim? Now, every human being, in fact every mammal, and I guess every insect, is born a victim. We need to be taken care of. Maybe turtles are not victims, they just swim, they just, you know, get out of their beach and out of their shell and run right to the ocean, and there they are. But humans, when we are born, we are victims. All we can do is suck. We can't use our hands, we can't stand up and walk around. Somebody needs to change our diaper. And then as we grow up, we're told what clothes to wear, how to put them on. We're told to clean up the room. We're told to go to school. We're told to do what we're told to do. And many of the 3-year-olds would rather sit there and play on the floor with their toy truck or their baby doll or whatever. But no, we keep being told what to do, and so we remain Victims. And then we go to school, and most— how many kids do you know that really actually like going to school? Very few. Most kids don't like being told to go to school. They don't like going to school, but they have to go anyway. So that means now the attitude is that they were victim of school. Then we become victim of high school, victim of university, victims of our jobs, victims of the hospital we work in, victims of the that we bought and now it owns us. Victims of the car that breaks down and needs gas and needs oil and all of that. And guess who's got to do it? Poor old me. I'm being victimized by that car. All right. And so we have this basic attitude of being a victim, and we can change that attitude from being a victim to being a winner. In fact, everybody wants to feel like a winner. They want to feel successful. And so they go out doing things the way that victims do it. Oh, if I feel— if I buy that car, I'll feel good. Or, oh, I want a girlfriend. If I had a girlfriend, I'd feel good. Well, the way to get a girlfriend, they say on television, is to buy the car. And so now I bought a car and I've got a girlfriend, but neither one of them are satisfying, not really. And so I fight with my wife and I pay for the car, and I'm still dissatisfied in my life. I'm still a victim. But in fact, if we can train to be an Anagami, if we can train to have a winner's attitude, then we don't need the car, we don't need the girl, we don't need the house, we don't need the job, we're just good to go already. And now we can make our choices wisely, rather than based upon desire. And so desires are always coming up from out of our victim's position. Our victim's attitude. How can we change the body from being uptight into relaxed? How can we change the feelings from being fear into being non-fear? How can we change our attitude from being a victim into being a winner? All has to do with the moment-by-moment thoughts that we have. And if we can start changing the thoughts, I can do this, then we can begin to change our attitude from being a victim to a winner. If we can change our attitude from being a victim to a winner, then we can begin to feel safe. If we can feel safe and secure and a winner, then we can relax. So we see how all four of these work together, and they inter-respond and inter-react with one another. And so moment by moment, the practice is to look at how we're thinking, look at what our attitude is, look at how we feel, and look at how the body is responding. And we can start controlling our breathing. We can eventually control the body and control it to relax. If we can control the body to relax, we can begin to control our attitude. If we can control both the body to relax and our attitude of a winner, eventually— and the hard one is to control the way we feel so that we feel safe and secure rather than afraid. Victims are afraid, victims are uptight, they're tense. And we come out of our victim's attitude into the attitude of a winner, where the winner feels safe because he's the one who won. And he's the one who can relax because it's no longer dangerous for him. He's fit the battle. And what is the real battle? The real battle is in the mind. The real battle is the kind of thoughts that we have, because our thoughts keep us as victims. It keeps us unsafe, and it keeps us uptight and tense. And if we can change our thoughts, along with that, we can change the mental states We can also change the feelings and we can change the body. That's Anapanasati right there. That's it. To change, change model. It's definitely a change model. Can you change your thoughts right now? Can you take a deep breath and relax and change the body? Can you actually stop having an attitude of being a victim which has attitudes of confusion, has attitudes of doubts, worries. And can we just change that attitude into, there's no problem, I've got this made, everything is all right? And if we can change that attitude, we can change the way that we feel. Oh, I can feel safe, I can feel comfortable, I can feel satisfied. And that feeling of satisfaction is what the Buddha is actually after. In Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, we can either feel satisfied or dissatisfied. Victims are dissatisfied. Can we change our attitude to being a winner? We won, we're satisfied.

**Speaker B:** What about, like, the part about, like, uprooting craving.

**Speaker A:** Through victims? Crave— victims want things to be different. Victims are the ones who want the car, they want the girlfriend. Why? Because they don't feel safe and secure on the inside.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I guess the place I'm— the reason I'm asking this question is like a lot of the, um, the teachers like in the West at least, they will teach a method like Vipassana, saying that this method will somehow change the mind and make you into an enlightened person.

**Speaker A:** Could not possibly happen. Changes are done intentionally. But if you have an insight, dang, look, I'm doing that wrong, then next time it starts up to happen like that, you'll decide, I'm not going to do it way anymore, I decide to make a change. The insights by themselves don't help. It is the insight that's big enough that you can decide that you're going to make a change. It hurts too much. Okay, but that's not Anapanasati. Anapanasati is starting at whatever it is right now. It doesn't have to be a great big thing that you finally decide. But you can start deciding right now to start changing, start changing those little bit of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. You can buy into the change model rather than buy into the insight model. The insights themselves will change you— that's not possible. You can see immediately that just because you could see something— here's an example. You're walking down the street and you see a great big dog pile. The dog just left it. Now it's steaming. You see it, but you walk right into it anyway, and now you got dog stuff all over your foot. But some meditations say, oh, I see that dog pile on the sidewalk. Let me scoop it up, take it in the house, Cut it up with a knife, put some of it in the blender, let's put it in the oven, let's really check it out. That's what insight meditation is, is if you take that dog turd into the kitchen and investigate it, pretty soon you're beginning to find out that it's actually shit and you should not eat it. Well, it doesn't take very long for you to figure that out. You could see that dog turd on the sidewalk and just step around it. You do not have to have insight into that dog turd you've already got enough insight. The question is, can you change?

**Speaker B:** Okay. I feel like having concentration or like some amount of like collection of the mind has been really helpful, and that's why like I initially asked you about— Collectedness.

**Speaker A:** I like the word concentration. Is completely different.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I mean, is like—.

**Speaker A:** In fact, that's what the word Samadhi means, is gather together. The word concentration has the quality of removing stuff to get down to the basics. And the example that I use would be concentrated milk or frozen concentrated orange juice. Frozen concentrated orange juice, actually nobody eats that. Some people do, but mostly what you want to do is to put the water back in it to make it drinkable. So, so that's what we're meaning, that with the frozen concentrated orange juice, we go collect some water and put in there too to make it whole again, to where the word concentration means to take stuff out. So let's use this example. Imagine that you were in the attic.

**Speaker B:** That I I think I get where you're going. I'm wondering like what kind of practices would you recommend for like developing Samadhi in like a more, more than just momentary?

**Speaker A:** Over and over and over again, repeat, repeat. This is a repetitive process. What are we repeating? We're repeating to come out of unwholesome thoughts and repeat wholesome thoughts. We're also working with the breath, to remember to take a deep breath, to remember to control your breathing, over and over, this breath, the next breath, the next breath, the next breath after that. All right? Repetition, repetition, repetition, over and over again, to start coming out of our attitude of being a victim. See that attitude? And change it to a positive attitude. See it again as a negative attitude and make a change into a positive attitude. Repetition, repetition, repetition. We could also use that word in the sense of focus. All right, imagine— let's use the example of reading a book. Have you ever started reading a book and after the first paragraph, or down in there, and you start another paragraph and you recognize that you don't even know how you got there, that the passage before that, you don't remember it. Why? Because you weren't focused on the book, you were focused on whatever was going on in the mind. And in fact, what happens is, is that something is said in the writing, we read that, we start to think about it, the eyes continue down the page, but now we're not reading what the eyes are looking at, we're reading what's in the mind. A page later, we recognize that we're lost. That's especially true for a fast-moving book, or maybe mathematics, or whatever like that. So yes, we have to stay focused. And here we're focusing on the breath, we're focusing on the way we feel, we're focusing on our attitude, and we're focusing on the kind of thoughts that we have. But that's completely different than getting down into deep meditation and really, really concentrating that in fact that's a fallacy. An example would be the kid doing his math homework, and the child is sitting there with the piece of paper, but he's not doing it. He's thinking about his friends, he may be playing with his cell phone, he may be watching television or listening to music, or whatever like that. And Mom comes in and says, "Concentrate on your homework!".

**Speaker B:** Homework.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's different than if he would do the first item, do the second item, continue to focus, do the third item, continue to look, and do the fourth item, and do the fifth. That his homework is done. Many kids take 2 hours to do homework that would take them 10 minutes to do. Why? Because they're not actually paying attention to the homework. The mind is running around all over the place. Well, this is exactly what happens to meditators when they first start meditating, is that their mind is not collected, it's not focused, it can't remember to come back and start again. And so this is a skill that needs to be developed. But what that does then is it organizes and collects the mind together Collecting it in the sense for the body of feeling relaxed in the feelings of safety and security, in the attitude of being a winner, not a victim, and of the thoughts having wholesome thoughts. When we bring all of that together, this is what we mean by a unified mind. A Samadhi mind, a collected mind. It's got all of these ingredients collected together, and that's got nothing to do with a concentrated mind. Concentrated mind is like the child. In fact, the rest of the story is that the child, when mom comes into the room, he's working and he's studying really hard, and he's doing like this, and he's trying to prove to her that he's really concentrating on his homework. So you could say, you may have even heard about this, a tryhard. It's a driver. People are driven to try hard. They're driven to have the, let us say, the behavior that shows other people that they're working really hard at it.

**Speaker B:** That would describe me, or parts of me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Rather than actually doing it and playing with it as a toy, getting it down, repeating, focused— that's an easy place. But try hard is hard work. That's concentration, struggle. And a lot of people struggle to relax. They would rather try to relax rather than just relaxing. There's a statement, this came from the National Rifle Association, I think it was Charlton Heston who was saying this when he was the leader of it, is, "You can't take this rifle from my cold head hand." hands. Okay, so even while he was dying, he was hanging on, he was clinging to that rifle, right? Okay, guess what? It's hard to use a rifle when you're clinging to it with your cold dead hands. That's a try, okay? It's a clinging. That's what trying is, is really, really grasping and clinging, and it's not recommended. We're recommending loose, easy, but you keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back in an easy way, rather than trying to stay there, grasping, holding, clinging. That's not the right way to practice. The right way to practice is keep coming back and keep coming back, keep coming back. And that's when things will collect together. Here's another example. Imagine that somebody has just delivered an entire pallet of concrete bags, each one of them weighing 100 pounds, and they deliver them to the wrong part of the site. And it's your job to move all of that cement, maybe several thousand pounds of it, tons of cement, and you have to move it from here to there. So you can put your shoulder onto that pallet, you can push, and you can struggle, and you can concentrate, but that's not the right way to move that cement. The right way to move it is one bag at a time. Pick up this bag, carry it over there, set it down, go back and repeat again. Pick up this bag, carry it over. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** So there's a whole different thing between.

**Speaker A:** Concentration versus repetitive practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it sounds like you're The way you're describing the practice is different from this idea that enlightenment is like some kind of event past which things get easier?

**Speaker A:** Well, we can say it this way. Enlightenment is not an enlightenment experience. Enlightenment is being light. Right now, and right now again, over and over and over again, we're light. But most of the Westerners have the idea that enlightenment has to do with one experience, or maybe a series of experiences, a peak experience. And when you have that peak experience, the peakest of peak experiences, then you're enlightened, as if that peak experience is going to completely change your entire perspective, your entire behavior, your your entire attitude, your entire posture, and everything's not going to happen. You're going to have to change all of that little stuff all by yourself. When? When you remember that you can change it. Okay, here's a good example of that. People go to church, they get involved with the church, and the preacher wants them to have a ceremony, a baptism, that you'll take Jesus as your savior and you get baptized. On Sunday night, and by Wednesday they're back in their sin again. So they got to go back to church to get a renewal, get a revival. Why? Because that baptism did not work. It was not— it was an event, it was a big event, it was a spectacular event, but it didn't change anything. Changing has to be done moment by moment. So people can have all kinds of big experiences in meditation. They can go deep into meditation. They can have a fantastic experience. They can feel like they're on the moon, they're so high. But that's not going to change anything after they come out of that. It's just going to leave them with a story to tell, and that's about all they're going to get out of it, except for perhaps wanting it again and not getting it again. Now they're in Dukkha because they want something they don't have anymore. It's better to be easygoing moment by moment than it is to have a few peak experiences followed by a whole lot of Dukkha, and then another peak experience, and then a whole lot of Dukkha. It's better to get things straightened out so you feel satisfied this moment, satisfied the next moment. After that satisfaction, everything is okay. Now that's kind of a peak experience to know that, wow, no matter what happens, I'm okay. Wow, I've got this way. I got no more troubles. I've got no more Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** I see where you're coming from.

**Speaker A:** And so all these peak experiences of what so many people are— they're after, they're hoping that the change is going to happen to them, rather than recognizing that the change is something that they're going to have to do.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes. We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Okay. You take care. Alrighty.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you again, Joe.

**Speaker B:** You can too. Take care.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Topic: Clarifying *Anattā* (Not-Self) and the Practical Path**

The talk centers on correcting a common misinterpretation of Buddhist doctrine and outlining a practical, moment-to-moment training method.

**1. Key Doctrinal Clarification: *Anattā* vs. "No-Self"**
*   **Not "No-Self," but "Not-Soul":** Dhammarato argues that *anattā* is incorrectly translated as "no-self." The Buddha was denying the concept of a permanent, unchanging **soul** (*ātā*), like in "Mahatma" (great soul), not the conventional, fluid sense of "self."
*   **Self vs. Soul:** A "soul" is defined as eternal and identical before and after death. The Buddha rejected this because all phenomena, including consciousness, are impermanent and conditional (e.g., hearing consciousness arises and passes with hearing).
*   **The Problem of "Selfishness":** The practical issue is **selfishness**—the clinging to a sense of "me" and "mine." This selfish attitude is what causes suffering (*dukkha*). When selfishness fades (e.g., freely giving money without attachment), suffering ceases.

**2. Practical Framework: The "Change Model" of *Ānāpānasati* (Mindfulness of Breathing)**
Dhammarato presents meditation not as a passive insight vehicle, but as an active, repetitive training in changing one's mental habits.
*   **Breath as the Training Ground:** Just as one can learn to like spicy chilies by changing one's attitude, one can learn to like and appreciate the breath. Conscious, relaxed breathing energizes the body and mind, preventing dull, dream-like states mistaken for "deep meditation."
*   **The Four Foundations as a Change Process:** Practice involves moment-to-moment adjustment of four interlinked areas:
    1.  **Body:** Learn to relax it intentionally through breath.
    2.  **Feelings:** Shift from fear-based feelings (anxiety, anger) to safety-based feelings (comfort, satisfaction).
    3.  **Mind (Attitude):** Shift from a **victim mentality** (passive, needy, dissatisfied) to a **winner's mentality** (secure, capable, satisfied without external dependencies).
    4.  **Thoughts:** Replace unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones.
*   **Repetition, Not Concentration:** The goal is **samādhi** (collectedness/unification), built through gentle, repetitive return to the practice—like moving bags of cement one by one. This is contrasted with strained "concentration" or "trying hard," which is a form of clinging.

**3. Critiques of Common Misconceptions**
*   **"Insight" vs. "Change":** Merely having insights or "peak experiences" (e.g., in deep meditation) doesn't automatically change behavior. Lasting change requires a **conscious decision** to adopt new habits. Investigating a problem (like a dog turd) isn't as useful as simply deciding to step around it.
*   **"Enlightenment" as an Event:** Enlightenment is not a one-time, permanent peak experience that magically transforms you. It is a continuous state of being "light" and satisfied in the present moment, cultivated through persistent, moment-by-moment practice.
*   **Identification is Suffering:** Suffering arises from identifying with anything—a body part, a political party, a feeling, or a thought. Freedom comes from de-identification (e.g., watching a medical procedure with curiosity rather than as "me" being harmed).

**4. Direct Advice for the Practitioner**
*   When a selfish or "self"-referential thought arises, see it early and let it go, returning to a state of safety and satisfaction.
*   Practice feeling safe and secure in the present moment, as much fear is based on mental projection, not current reality.
*   The entire path is a **change model**: you can change your thoughts, which changes your attitude, which changes your feelings, which relaxes your body.

**Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes that the Dhamma is a practical, do-it-yourself training manual. The goal is to uproot suffering by understanding *anattā* as the absence of a permanent soul and by actively using mindfulness of breath to transform one's moment-to-moment experience from one of a fearful, needy victim to a satisfied, secure "winner."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A to explain Buddhist concepts:

### **Core Metaphors**
1.  **Chilies / Food Taste:** Used repeatedly to explain **"suchness" (reality as it is)** vs. **perception**.
    *   **Point:** The spicy taste on the tongue is the reality ("suchness"). Whether someone likes or dislikes it is a **perception** based on past experience and habit. This illustrates how we can change our relationship to reality by changing our perception.

2.  **Autopsy / Medical Procedures:** Used to explain **identification** and **selfishness**.
    *   **Story:** The movie scene from *Dracula: Dead and Loving It* where student doctors faint during an autopsy. The point is that if you **identify** with the corpse ("that could be me"), you suffer. If you see it as a neutral procedure or "just a piece of meat," there's no problem. This applies to drawing blood as well.
    *   **Point:** Suffering arises from **identifying** with an experience as "me" or "mine."

3.  **Political Party / Nationalism / Tribalism:** Extends the identification metaphor to social groups.
    *   **Point:** If you identify as a Republican or Democrat, your happiness fluctuates with the party's fortunes. Identification with **anything** (ideas, groups) causes attachment and suffering.

4.  **Breath as Chilies:** Links the core metaphor to meditation practice (**Anapanasati**).
    *   **Point:** Just as we can learn to like chilies by changing our attitude, we can learn to enjoy and appreciate the breath through mindful attention, transforming it from something ignored into a source of calm and energy.

5.  **Victim vs. Winner:** A sustained metaphor for the **mind state** (third foundation of mindfulness).
    *   **Victim:** Feels controlled by external forces (school, job, car, relationships), is fearful, tense, and craving.
    *   **Winner:** Feels in charge of their inner state, safe, secure, satisfied, and not dependent on external things.
    *   **Point:** The path is about changing one's fundamental attitude from that of a passive victim to an empowered "winner" in the battle of the mind.

6.  **Dog Turd on the Sidewalk:** Used to critique an overemphasis on **"insight" (Vipassana)** meditation.
    *   **Story:** You see a dog turd on the sidewalk. You don't need to take it home, dissect it, and analyze it to know you shouldn't eat it or step in it. You just see it and skillfully avoid it.
    *   **Point:** While insight is valuable, the crucial step is **behavioral change** based on simple understanding. Endless analysis isn't always necessary; sometimes you just need to "step around" unwholesome states.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **The $500 Loan:** A simple story to illustrate how **selfishness** (attached to "my money") creates suffering for both the giver and receiver, while non-attachment creates happiness.

2.  **Moving Cement Bags:** An analogy to contrast **concentration** (as struggle) with **repetitive, collected practice** (Samadhi).
    *   **Wrong way:** Trying to push the entire pallet at once (straining, "trying hard").
    *   **Right way:** Moving one bag at a time, consistently and patiently (repetitive, focused practice).

3.  **Child Doing Homework / "Try-Hard":** Illustrates the difference between **focused collection** and strained **concentration**.
    *   The child pretending to work hard for mom ("try-hard") is straining and clinging.
    *   The child who simply does one problem after another, returning focus when distracted, is practicing correct "collection" of the mind.

4.  **Frozen Orange Juice Concentrate:** A linguistic analogy to clarify the term **Samadhi**.
    *   "Concentration" (like juice concentrate) means *removing* elements to get a dense essence.
    *   **Samadhi** means *gathering* and *collecting* the mind into a unified, wholesome state—it's about **adding** the right components (relaxation, safety, a winner's attitude), not stripping away.

5.  **Church Baptism & Revival:** An analogy to criticize the quest for **peak enlightenment experiences**.
    *   **Point:** A one-time, dramatic event (like a baptism or a profound meditative experience) doesn't create lasting change. Real transformation requires **moment-by-moment** change in thought and attitude, not just a fleeting peak experience.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose**
The metaphors and stories consistently serve to:
*   Demystify Buddhist terms (anatta, suchness, Samadhi, Dukkha).
*   Shift the focus from **intellectual insight** to **practical, moment-to-moment behavioral change**.
*   Argue against a passive, event-based view of enlightenment in favor of an active, gradual "change model."
*   Ground abstract concepts in everyday, relatable experiences (money, food, work, fear).
