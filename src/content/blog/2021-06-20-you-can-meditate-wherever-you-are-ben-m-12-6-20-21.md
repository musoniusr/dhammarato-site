### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There is a lot of distractions to the correct practice, but correct practice is actually quite simple, and that is to gladden the mind, to cheer it up, to throw unwholesome thoughts out, and to live a happy life, one happy thought after another. It could not be more simple than that, and yet look how complicated it has been made. So Ben, it's good to see you. Glad to see you again. Hear that you've gotten a new job.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** So talk about that. You mentioned something on the fly that I thought really needed to be put, uh, on there when you were— you were actually talking about it is the distinction between East and West. And so I'll let you flow back again with that point.

**Speaker B:** So yes, I've started a new job, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. I'm working as a laboratory technician in a DNA analysis company. So a lot of science and a lot of carryover from what I've learned at university. So I'm quite excited to get stuck in and to learn, and learn all the technical aspects of it, all of the pipetting and use of chemicals and whatnot. It's very valuable lab experience.

**Speaker A:** I see. Right. In your, in your world, you would say that, uh, that in the case of you either bait or cut fish, you're cutting fish.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, well, there's a little bit of mix around with the words there.

**Speaker B:** Well, the company gets sent water samples and in these special filters that they designed, and what we do is we read the DNA in the filters and then we're able to tell what animals are present in the water sample. So it's a very, very powerful piece of analysis. Which I've learned about in university but never had the opportunity to carry out myself. So I'm very excited to be involved in this.

**Speaker A:** But may I ask you a technical question? Just on the side, of course. They say that as the temperature of the air rises, the more moisture it will contain, so that when the temperature falls, when there's a lot of moisture in the air, they call it rain. My question is, is that as the temperature of water rises, what happens to the salinity?

**Speaker B:** To the salinity?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Saline solutions of the oceans, that's the question that I have. If you, for instance, in reverse osmosis and a lot of different other processes, the salinity increases. And my question is, does that happen with temperature? Is there a point in a temperature scale like 4 degrees centigrade where the salinity is either the greatest or the smallest without adding any water? Or my goodness, only good questions have no answers.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm trying to remember now because Because around the equator, well, the salinity of seawater is always about, give or take, about 35 PSU, no matter where you go really. In the Arctic and the Antarctic, you have slightly denser water because although it's colder, where the ice forms, it sucks water out. So you're left with less volume of water, but with more salt. So then you get things called haloclines, which you're able to track because they're heavier and they stay uniform.

**Speaker A:** But around the equator— I'm talking about it in the sense of heating it up rather than cooling it down to 4 degrees Kelvin, or excuse me, 4 degrees centigrade. Which I believe is the largest volume, or is it 4°F? One or the other. That's why bottles break in the freezer, is because when ice starts to form, that's when it's at its largest. And that's also at the point where the salt is forced out. But I'm talking about what happens then at the other end of the scale. What happens if we go 200, 300, 400 degrees?

**Speaker B:** You go to 200 or 300 or 400 degrees, you're not going to have any water. It's going to be evaporated away.

**Speaker A:** Well, it is if it's going to be in a glass-lined or somewhat pipeline that has solar panels all around it, where you're piping water with the intention of piping it into the desert and getting it as hot as you can. By the time that it reaches the place where you're really going to boil the heck out of it.

**Speaker B:** Well, around the equator and whatnot, it's warmer. You've got more evaporation, so the water is more dense, more salty even, and less dense. But I can't speak for water in a pipe, saline water, a couple hundred degrees. Unfortunately, I don't know that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, never mind. Yeah, it was just a passing, uh, question anyway. I'm sure that whoever really needs to know the answer will find it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm sure they will.

**Speaker A:** So, so in any case, yes, so congratulations, you've gotten, um, employment.

**Speaker B:** I have, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And let us not, uh, say the word but rather dance around the word work. Because if you think of it as a job, then we automatically go into it with the wrong kind of attitude, rather than the attitude of exploring.

**Speaker B:** I think on my first day I was very nervous and whatnot. It's a new endeavor, etc., etc. But from being there a week, I've— per se, I've just thought of it as, you know, learning skills and doing work. I've not really labeled it as a job because I don't know, so many people in the West and whatnot are dissatisfied with their job. And they hate working.

**Speaker A:** They're supposed to be. That's why we call it work. That's why I call it you got to get a job. You got to slave. You got to labor. Listen to all the vocabulary that we put into that because of the expectations of what it is all about. And then they have the ideas of white collar versus blue collar versus no collar at all, I think, is the only other option. Maybe redneck. But yeah, everyone is supposed to not like their job. Even the people who are making tons of money, they really don't like it because they always— people who are making a lot of money always do it in a dirty way, and they don't like the dirt, as well as the fear that somebody may be on their dirt trail.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very scary. But, um, But yeah, so I haven't been thinking of it like that. Like, I know my mum, she really does not enjoy her job. She cracks on, she gets on with it, but complaints, complaints. Oh, I didn't sleep well, complaints. I'm just like, no, I'm not of that school of thought. You know, I'm just gonna take it.

**Speaker A:** Amazing when you change your attitude about life.

**Speaker B:** It's crazy, it really is. Um, so yeah, because I've got this job, uh, the question that I was going to ask was, you know, how does one incorporate the, the Dharma in and around this? Because the big distinction which I think I've noticed between Western meditation mindfulness practice and Eastern meditation practice and whatnot. So by starting this job, I've already thought to myself, I need to be focused and present at what I'm doing because there's contamination risks I need to be mindful of that I'll be using.

**Speaker A:** You could be Mr. COVID-20.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, but yeah, so that's the distinction that I've made, and I'm wondering how I can incorporate the Dharma and its teachings into this new job.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you made a remark when we were first turning the video on about how in the West that the Western ideal is that, uh, you said it's almost like recharging a battery. Yeah, yeah, or charging a battery, getting a battery up, and then you can take that battery out into the world and use

**Speaker B:** it.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that an interesting way of looking at it, that kind of view? While battery technology itself is still problematic, yes, and as they're making great gains with it, it's still not up to scratch. Even in the physical world, even with liquid flow and ion air and all of these other brand new technologies, liquid metal, they haven't really, you know, done their— lived up to their expectations and the desire. All right. So given that that's the physical reality of things, Imagine about that with the emotional reality or the spiritual reality on the other hand. All right. That in fact, possibly the best that we could hope for in a human world would be the equivalent of on the highway, you would have a hybrid.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that hybrid then is going to have a really, really excellent battery storage, but it can also top up on the way. And so the engines then are highly finely tuned to crank up, put out as much energy as they can for a short period of time, and then turn back off again. And that's done on a regular basis. Okay, that then would be more like the Sati of turning that engine on, cranking things back up, repowering, regenerating, get your attitude, get your mojo going, and then we can coast on the batteries for a little while and then pop, start that thing up, get it going again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this would be a way that we could look at it. Now it's very interesting, um, there, there's another rationale that I can see that's built into the society that's older and deeper than you might imagine.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that is the idea in Christianity of paying penance or doing your dues or getting away with it, or whatever like that. 17 Hail Marys. This is really built deep into the Western psyche of you've got to pay for it. And so this gives them the idea that they have to go and recharge the batteries in the meditation retreat, which is basically nothing more than another way of saying that those going to a meditation retreat is being like taking piano lessons. Yeah, okay. And it's pretty good to keep taking piano lessons because the more often you take them— but you're not going to learn to play the piano if you only take piano lessons. You got to take it home and practice.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. There can't be a disconnect, you know, like, uh, I play the drums. I haven't played them for a while, but back in secondary school and college, I played them a lot, and I was self-taught. I taught myself, and then I also got a teacher, but then I didn't stop playing the drums when I wasn't with my teacher. I kept on playing in my spare time, you know. There wasn't a disconnect.

**Speaker A:** Right. This is exactly what we're talking about. Uh, and, uh, even though you could say that you were self-taught, I bet you were not. I bet there were some drummers you looked at really closely. Oh yes, even slowing down their videos. Uh-huh, exactly right. All right, you had teachers. Yeah, they were modern teachers, but you still had teachers. That's an important point also, is that we do need teachers to get this thing rolling. But let's talk about it in really simple, easy-to-understand terms that even a child could understand. And that is that the whole point of all of this teaching of the Buddha is to get ourselves into a really nice state. Yeah, to get ourselves into a very enjoyable, playful state so that everything is okay, everything is marvelous. Everything is interesting. Everything invites curiosity and also camaraderie. And so that whole playful attitude about life, then we can take that wherever we go. And if we choose to do it while employed, then that's a whole lot better off than being in a really nice state until you do go to work and now you're miserable for all day like you're supposed to be. Calling it a job, complaining, talking about other people at the water cooler, and all of that kind of stuff, so that you could go in actually with the commitment that keeping the mind clean is going to be the job rather than the employment. Or another way, Anapanasati, the job when I'm using that term, I'm talking about it only in the sense of this is what's really in front of us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. How I feel about this moment, my attitude, that's what's closest at hand. And then the outside world is the next layer out. And if I can get the internal world together, then I can deal with the external world just fine. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a very important part. Going into it with the right attitude and viewpoint for the mind and whatnot. And then it makes everything else external a hell of a lot more easy to deal with. It all starts in here.

**Speaker A:** Well, not only does it start in there, it stayed in there. It didn't go no places like Las Vegas. What's born in the mind kind of stays in the mind. But boy, does it burn the mind while it's in there staying.

**Speaker B:** Goodness. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So then it's not what's in the mind that leaks out, it's the adrenaline instead. That's what gets leaked out. And so now the body is affected, but it all stayed in the mind anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** No matter how hard you try to convince that guy, he's such a klutz and that's why I'm angry, it still stays in the mind. It didn't get over there. He didn't buy it an inch.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it all stays in the mind.

**Speaker A:** But, uh, and so when we recognize we got a choice about that, we really do have a choice about what gets in the mind and what stays in the mind. In fact, that's one of the teachings of the Buddha when he talks about what invades the mind and remains. That's the important key. Okay. And there is some stuff about it in what's called the Honeyball Sutta, which is number 18.

**Speaker B:** Honeyball Sutta.

**Speaker A:** Right. But what it's actually talking about is that the repetitious perceptions that tinge and cling to the mind and repeat themselves over and over and over again, um, really puts us at a down state because we cling to them. It's almost like they get ground in as a habit. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** it makes sense in terms of psychology and brain neuroscience as well. The more that you cling to them, the more you think about them, you know, the stronger the associated neurons are going to be.

**Speaker A:** So, and so in that regard, we can almost say that we do that even with certain television networks and certain stations or certain news kind of systems, so that we will not listen to what the other side has to say. We couldn't, we couldn't, we couldn't let it in. It doesn't fit our neurology. It just doesn't compute, literally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, doesn't compute.

**Speaker A:** It just doesn't get in. So in that way, we get really, really narrow-minded. And the reason that it doesn't get in is because we've already got the neuron pattern set up the way that it was. Yeah. And so this whole system of Anapanasati is like rewiring the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the analogy with the cowherder, rawhide and all of that, all of that stuff. Yeah, you like that. Yes, it makes perfect sense. You know, if I catch myself thinking about something which is unwholesome, you know, I will actively be like give a little, like, I've just held something in the face and I'm just like, be gone with you, you are gone. And I feel really good about it. And by doing that, by not entertaining what has arisen, you're actively not using those neurons in your brain which are associated with it, which means they're going to get weaker and weaker and degrade. So the space between having that unwholesome thought is going to get larger and larger and larger and larger and larger until you don't anymore.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly the way that the Buddha describes it, and that's the way that so many people experience in that. So congratulations, you're just going right down the same path that so many have gone before, is to recognize we can change. We literally can change the chemistry of the mind. We can change the way we feel.

**Speaker B:** It's a very liberating feeling. Very, very, very, very.

**Speaker A:** And so practicing that merely on the cushion, what's the point?

**Speaker B:** You need to incorporate it into everyday life. You need to.

**Speaker A:** So you could think of it in this way, is that we only need to sit on the cushion long enough to get ourselves into a really, really nice state. And then what we do is that we maintain that nice state no matter what, while we do things like opening our eyes and turning around as we get up and stand and take a deep breath and say, yes, I can stand here and feel this same way. And then we start to walk and we can recognize that we can walk in this state. All right, this is what walking meditation is all about. In fact, the second Jhana is, uh, the— not the secret, but the, uh, the old story is, is that in walking meditation we can actually reach second Jhana. And in fact, that's the reason why you want to set boundaries,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Is so when you reach the boundary you can get a present enough mind to turn around and go back to the boundary. Other than that, you might float away. No mind, you see. And so we can in fact get into really, really nice states of first Jhana while we're walking around. So that's the first thing. But we can also go back to the sutta where the Buddha was talking about This is, by the way, in the Fives of the Anguttara Nikaya. I don't remember exactly which number it is when you talk about 5 ways to reach the first Jhana, or in our child's language, 5 ways to get yourself into a really delighted state. And one of those ways, in fact the last one on the list, is the way that people think of in Western mentality of meditation. Okay, now the important point is, is that the sitting down in the meditation, the first job is to clean the mind of unwholesome thoughts. Yeah, that's the first and only job, basically. First item on the list: take a deep breath and clear the mind of all unwholesome thoughts. Well, that can be done while standing, that can be done while walking. That can be done before we speak.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we can speak while the mind is still clear. All right. And so the next quality of it is, is that with that quality of being free from hindrances and know that we can walk around and talk and speak and stay clean and free from hindrances, we further can be delighted and joyful with the fact that we can actually walk and talk and be in this state. Isn't that marvelous? That's really great that we can actually sit here and be in First Jhana and know that. Yeah, let me start looking at these other four ways that the Buddha talks about getting the mind into this really nice state. And all four of them have to do with various occurrences of Being in the Dhamma with the concept and the understanding that the Dharma, the actual teachings of the Buddha, which we're talking about— Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, Paticcasamuppada, Anapanasati. You know, that little ball of wax that we've got is a new toy to play with, and that thing is wholesome and noble. It's noble because it's always been the truth, that it's wholesome. So wholesome and noble and long-term, long-lasting. The Noble Truths have always been noble and have always been liberating, always been wholesome. That's the remarkable part about it. So while we're talking about the Dhamma, we're only thinking about wholesome. While we're discussing the Dhamma, We're only discussing the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** It's just wholesome, nothing but wholesome.

**Speaker A:** There is no room for any unwholesome thoughts in a wholesome conversation of the Dhamma. And because of that, it leaves both the speaker and the listener in the position of marching right into First Jhana. And we can also recognize that that's one way and two ways. The first way is, is that the student can enter the first Jhana by listening to the teacher. The second one is, is that the teacher can enter into the first Jhana by teaching the Dhamma. And in fact, that's the whole reason for being able to teach the Dhamma, is by being able to demonstrate the fact that you could be in the state that we're talking about. And inviting the student into it. And then the next point is, is that we can also do that by reciting and rehearsing the Dhamma. Now, in the Pali language, a lot of people don't really know what it is, and it doesn't mean anything, and it's all magical anyway. But if you really understand what is the teaching, and going over it and mulling over it, one just by chanting can get oneself into that first Jhana. Because already the Dharma itself that we're chanting and rehearsing, knowing what it means, it means that the mind is free from unwholesome states. And then there's the interesting one, the fourth one, and that is in ordinary life while we're mulling over and just thinking about the Dharma, got nothing much else on the mind, we can actually get ourselves into a joyous state, and that can happen even when we're driving the car. That if we have our mind completely focused on my how nice it is, my how wonderful this Dharma is, that I really do feel free from all problems and all worries. Oh, what a beautiful drive this is, you know, and we're just tooling down the road. But in this case, we're completely mindful because at least we've got the mind in the present moment. We're watching where we're going and we're relishing it. We're really here now, and it's marvelous.

**Speaker B:** Be present,

**Speaker A:** which is a whole lot better driving than most people do who are eating ham sandwich or talking on the phone or screaming at the kids or looking for a document that they forgot to bring with them or any of that other kind of stuff that causes automobile accidents.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very dangerous.

**Speaker A:** You're a really, really rich dude and you want a really excellent driver, go to the Wat and get a meditator. Anagami knows where he's going and he's watching.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very good point. But yeah, so starting this job, I'm seeing ways to be really apply the Dharma while I am doing what I will be doing. Like you say, while you're driving, you've got to be mindful and whatnot. So while I'm doing what I'm doing, I've got to be mindful of what I'm doing. There's a process to it.

**Speaker A:** Listen, if you pull that Corona 20 virus molecule or little dude out of its feature gesture, you hold it up with your tweezers. You watch what you're doing. And don't even think about what he tastes like.

**Speaker B:** That would be terrible. I won't be doing that. I will not be doing that.

**Speaker A:** So mindfulness of what your hands are doing. Is determined upon the mindfulness of the mind of being in the present moment anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so while you're— what is like a switch that turns on and off. Are you just going to be in the mind thinking about whatever it is and doing what you're doing with your hands by rote, and maybe occasionally paying attention to what your hands are doing, but mostly you're thinking about Mom and the fight you had yesterday, or goodness

**Speaker B:** knows whatever, on like autopilot, right?

**Speaker A:** Like on autopilot, to where now we're going to say, no, I'm really going to pay attention to what's going on because I might miss something really important when I'm thinking about mom.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. There was a big talk about contamination protocols and stuff like that, so There is no room for error. I can't be thinking about Mom, Dad, or the dog. I've got to be really dialed in and present. I've got to be aware of what my hands are doing. I've got to be aware of where I'm placing stuff and stuff like that. So it may not be conventional sitting meditation, but I see opportunities to really be present and apply the Dharma in this setting.

**Speaker A:** How do we talk about it then? And you use the word conventional. I've also heard the word traditional, heard the word orthodox, which you hear the direction I'm going, all the way down to ultra-orthodox. And when you get all the way down to orthodox, ultra-orthodox, aren't you back to the practice of the Buddha, which in Thailand they call it, by the way, Anicca? Which means let's take the things back the way that they were before Asoka.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Which, uh, uh, all that far back would be the actual practice then of the Buddha, because we're only talking about, uh, uh, Asoka was either the, either the grandson, the great-grandson, or the great-grandson of King Bimbisara, who was a contemporary of the Buddha. And it was his lineage that were the warriors, and they eventually took over the whole area where Pasanadi, I think, and his crowd were kind of consumed with this whole Magadhi thing. So in any case, before Ahsoka, there was very little problems and controversies, and everybody kind of knew how to practice. It was when in the time of Asoka when it became really, really— actually, you could say it was royally supported when he built monasteries and he bought robes and he gave bowls and anybody who wanted to want any. For some reason, he thought that it was good to have a whole lot of monks rather than a few good monks.

**Speaker B:** You're a monk, you're a monk, you're a monk, everybody's a monk.

**Speaker A:** And when that happened, then we— then the really good monks had no possible way of training all of those monks. And so the actual teaching of the Buddha did remain alive, but it became kind of secluded and sequestered off to the side, but still living within the realms of the Dhamma. And it's always been that way. The Noble Dhamma has always been there. That's the clue that Bhikkhu Bodhisattva didn't even know about until he stumbled onto

**Speaker B:** it,

**Speaker A:** and then was invited into the old boys' club that had been going along all along. So this whole idea then is that if the actual practice and the teaching of the Buddha, that is actually kind of simple, can be encased, modified, shaved, and done a few things with, we can still present it as if that it was something valuable. But in fact, we're giving you a broken clock. And this is part of that idea, is, is that meditation is something that you do to charge your batteries.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's part of it. Rather than— no, The practice of Anapanasati is you need Sati when you need it, and you need to practice up so that you got it when you need it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And this is the real issue then, that there has been side issues that have been brought in. One of the issues would be magical powers. Yeah, and when people want magical powers that they don't have, that means that they want something that they don't have, and they're in, in purduka, and whatever practicing they are doing in order to get those magical powers don't work. My favorite example, in fact, is that it's a big deal in Hinduism, and I think in New Age and now Buddhism and all of that, is celibacy and magical powers are somehow linked together. Have you ever heard of that?

**Speaker B:** I've heard of it, and I immediately was like,

**Speaker A:** all right, well, here's double. And that is, is that you know where the history of the Catholic Church and their celibacy came from was because of politics, because of who owned the church when the old priest died. Okay, and if he's got illegitimate kids, then they've got a knock on that church. But if he's got no kids then, then he's— then the Catholic Church has got no competition and they own the land. That was the whole point of it. And that was in 10th, 11th century when that kind of stuff happened. Now here's the point about it. With all of these tens of thousands, at some points in time hundreds of thousands of Catholic monks, all celibate as best they can be, you don't see any of them flying around the belfry.

**Speaker B:** You should have hundreds of thousands of people flying around shooting white things.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Miracles are so rare in the Catholic Church, and they really, every one of them, have big difficulty proving it. And we kind of do that when we see the Catholic Church, because we've seen 1,000 years of their failures at magic tricks. And then we walk over there to Buddhism and say, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. And like you you're expecting anything new? You're expecting something new here?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Celibacy in Asia is different than celibacy in the Catholic Church. And in fact, one of the places where I was really familiar with that was that when I was a monk in, uh, in the United States, and there was an old Laotian monk who needed to go to the doctor, and he went, and the doctor told him he needed to go have prostrate examination. So I went with him, drove him to the prostate examination, was standing there beside the monk while the finger up the butt and all of that. I mean, talking to the doctor and, and his whole show. And so the whole point was, is that the doctor assumed because he was a Buddhist monk— and this is in Northern Carolina, North Carolina, where there's a lot of Catholics A lot of Catholics. We were within 20 miles of a Catholic monastery up there in Greensboro, North Carolina. So a lot of Catholics on the East Coast of the U.S. And so he said that this guy's got to go to surgery. And so he didn't want to do it there because this guy didn't want to give him free gratis. And so with the network, we found a doctor who would do it in California. We got him into California. The doctor there did it and says this guy doesn't have prostate cancer. He doesn't need surgery. That was because the doctor assumed, because he was a monk, that what he did feel was good enough to think that he did have it. It fit the model. Okay, what do they call that when the cops do it? Profiling.

**Speaker B:** Oh dear.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that was a direct case of that kind of profiling. Okay, so, so much for wanting spiritual powers, but there are real powers. In fact, Eckhart Tolle wrote a book on the power of the now, the power of clarity of mind, the power of seeing behaviors. We call it clairvoyance. Yes, audience, when you're actually listening to what people are saying, when you, when you hear the devas in their mind talking Yes, yes. All right, so there are real alterations, but the real powers have to do with the power of being in the present moment. Yes, not the powers of celibacy, of rounding the corner at 200 miles an hour. The next one is also very closely related to that, and that's the issue of rebirth. We could just touch that base. Yeah, and that is also the very same case that if the here and now is all that's important, and the very good idea is to get rid of the past, it's 10 years ago, then what about 10,000 years ago too? Not only that, but if I have choices enough in this present moment to change my childhood and to change even the way the genes operate, in the sense of no longer going around in instinctual behavior, but rather watching what's going on because we're mindful and alert. I'm almost about to say the word woke, but I think that's been taken now for another use.

**Speaker B:** God, that word's been thrown around so much.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, this is the idea then, is that the practice of Sati, that's what we want to try to practice during the day, is to remember to wake up. Yeah, to remember to take a deep breath, to remember to be here now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then we don't have to worry about the deep dark past, whether that deep dark past was 10 minutes ago, 10 hours ago, 10 years ago, 10,000 years ago. It doesn't matter what it was in the past, because we have this present moment, a choice to not live in the past. Yeah, to live in the future, to live in the present moment, this present

**Speaker B:** moment, not the future, not, not way out there.

**Speaker A:** No, not what people do for merit-making. Yeah, yeah, planning for the future because this one's not good enough. It's so not good enough, I can't do anything about it. It's not good enough is generally the attitude. Yes, all I can do in this, in this life is to, uh, at least make my next life of misery more comfortable.

**Speaker B:** It's still misery.

**Speaker A:** Well, someday my prince will come.

**Speaker B:** No, no, you can't rely on somebody else like that to just magically make everything better.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Well, that's what every religion more or less promises.

**Speaker B:** Comes back to victimhood. Woe is me, woe is me, somebody rescue me.

**Speaker A:** That's the basic, most fundamental level of doubt that people have. When people believe in rebirth and reincarnation, it always has to do with some subtlety. I'm out of control here, and I'm either in my past or in my future and not really in this present time because I'm not in control of this present time. My past is in control of this present time. Well, that's true up to a point. And the point is that we can change it.

**Speaker B:** Yes,

**Speaker A:** be present. Turn the automatic pilot off and fly your own plane.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So many people just don't do it though. It's, it's ridiculous. So many people just don't.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but they don't understand that they have the opportunity to, and part of that is because of that old doubt that has to do with, I can't do it myself, I'm not up to the task, therefore I have to rely upon something else— my past, my future, Someday my prince will come.

**Speaker B:** I'll get it in the next life.

**Speaker A:** Get it in the next life. Something will happen. I'll meet my guru someday. How to say it? My other half is out there. My soulmate.

**Speaker B:** You know, there's all kinds of stories

**Speaker A:** about this, and it always has to do with hoping based upon the fact that the present moment is not good enough. So instead of working on making the present moment good enough, they're still pining with the present not good enough, on and on and on and on, while none of that stuff that they want that's going to make the present moment good enough ever happens. Never happens. So here's the practices that we can make this present moment good enough. If we remember that it actually is good enough. That's the part that makes it marvelous, is that things are actually marvelous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. People just have an automatic perception of it's crap, it's this, it's that. But you know, it's good, and you work on making it good enough, and then it's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If there's— if it's good and then you notice good and then it's just more good and whoa, good.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can imagine, uh, you know the story of Sisyphus rolling the rock, the stone up the hill?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It slips and it falls to the bottom. Imagine that you're Sisyphus sitting at a point just below the top of the hill, just below the top of the hill where you can almost just put your hand up on the top of the hill. Just below the top of the hill, he's sitting there while with his foot he pushes that rock down the hill just to watch it roll. Hey man, watch that rock! You know, I never got a chance to watch it before. I was always too busy trying to keep it in place, and now watch it go.

**Speaker B:** Very fun.

**Speaker A:** A major change in attitude is let it go. The thing that's really interesting about dropping our burden is that the law of gravity and what they talk about, you know, 32 feet per second per second, that it speeds up. The more we drop, the faster it falls.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. People cling to it. They have a desire to make it different. But then you remove that clinging, you remove that desire, and then automatically it just— it drops, it goes. But people just hold on to it. They just don't let go.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, this is the whole point then, is letting go of every moment as it comes by. Just because this moment is marvelous doesn't mean that we're going to try to keep it. If it does, I mean, you think butter rots? This moment really There is gone. And so we don't cling to it and we let it go. Everything is arising and passing away, constantly arising and passing away. And quite a show it is too. And everybody doesn't know, but everybody's got a ticket to the show.

**Speaker B:** Whether you use the ticket or not,

**Speaker A:** everybody's got a ticket to the show. And so all we have to do is just enjoy the show. And so many people are screaming, I want my money back, I want my money back. And all you have to do is just enjoy the show. Yeah, because everything is arising and passing away, and things keep changing and changing. And so we just watch that and just let it go, just let it go. We're in the flow. And so we can maintain that state much of the day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's just still very— keep remembering, keep practicing. Every time that you recognize you're not in that flow state, pop back in.

**Speaker B:** Have that wake up, that wake up. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is why we practice on this, on the seat, on the stool, or on the cushion, or in the

**Speaker B:** middle to refine our skills for everyday

**Speaker A:** life to get the mind ready to go boating back out into the swamp.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** I told you about the log in the bog, didn't I?

**Speaker B:** The log in the bog? I don't think you did.

**Speaker A:** No, the story— oh, sorry about that. Yes, I'm referring to a story that the Buddha told. It's actually in Sutta number 36 in the Majjhima Nikaya. And that is a story that if you go into a swamp, that the trees that live there and die there and fall over, they will become completely submerged or just the very top of the log. You cannot go into the swamp, so the story goes, with fire-making equipment the way that they had in the time of the Buddha and rub things together and get that log to set on fire. It just won't set on fire. However, you can take that log out of the bog and set it on the shore But it still won't catch on fire because it's still waterlogged.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** However, if you leave it in the sun and let the gravity pull the water down, and the sun shines on the top, then you can actually start getting it to burn. This is in fact how they make dugout canoes anyway. They're not so much dugout as they're burned out. But Anicca, now that we've got the dugout, we can get it back into the water and we can use it as a boat instead of as a, you know, kind of dangerous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is how we would think of the mind then, because we want to get it out of the bog. But we want to get it boatworthy so that we can put it back into the bog. Yeah, what's the big deal about just leaving it on the beach after we've dug it out? No, we want to put it back in the bog. We want to put it to use. So this is also the mind too. We want to get the mind dug out enough to where we could use it as a raft so we can go floating in a boating. So this is another analogy that we can put into the— into all of that. So that's the log in the bog, and that's the story. Can you get in this thing and and paddled around, now that you got all the waterlogged part of the boat removed, you can actually set it on fire, burn it out. So this is how we think then of clearing space into the mind also, is we've got to get it away from the world and get it off someplace so that we can They'll start to drain the bog that's caught into the mind out of the mind, just like the water would drain out of the bog. We're going to drain the unwholesome thought, whatever, out. Once we get the unwholesome thoughts out, now we're going to shore things up so that when people add their unwholesome thoughts, we don't let them come in. Yeah, waterproof this thing. And so this is another— right, so that you don't get affected by the unhappiness of others. But we can talk about this more because this is in fact a major part of the teaching, and that is the whole quality of Metta and how to deal with the world of struggle and sorrow. And the answer to that is joyfully. But you got to have the joy.

**Speaker B:** Gotta have the joy first.

**Speaker A:** Gotta have the joy first. Don't go into battle hoping that somebody will fall and you get their sword.

**Speaker B:** You're gonna be just running on the battlefield, no armor, no shield, no nothing, and you're just like, yeah, where's the stuff? Where's the stuff?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. No, we need to be armed with the Dhamma. Take the Dharma with us. Okay, then keep the mind wholesome. And so that's the way we can get started with this. And you're right that this is the whole point of it. The sitting practice is actually to get us ready and then to retreat and get ready again and then retreat and get ready again and keep coming in and out and in and out until pretty soon you can handle this job. This is not a job anymore. It's just what we're doing right now while we're having a ball.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Think of it in fact as a celebration, that your job is not celebrating getting a job. The celebration is the doing the job.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so let the job become a celebration. Yeah, look at that little turtle crawl. He crawled right across my microscope

**Speaker B:** lens.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the dogs are talking.

**Speaker B:** Oh, they're having a good conversation.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the local coconut farmers is puttering through.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay.

**Speaker A:** So now that Lucky's had her say, saying, this is my land,

**Speaker B:** making, making their presence known.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the dogs really know that song very well. Comes out of a movie. It's called The Exodus. You know that, that song?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Land is mine. God gave this land

**Speaker B:** to me.

**Speaker A:** No, that dog, he just born here, that's all. So that's the territorial instinct. Yeah, the dogs play with it very well. So do the humans.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, the humans play with it very well.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so to finish this talk off, let's round one point up, and that is, is that there is a lot of distraction obstructions to the correct practice. But correct practice is actually quite simple, and that is to quieten the mind, to cheer it up, to throw unwholesome thoughts out, and to live a happy life, one happy thought after another. It could not be more simple than that, and yet look how complicated it has been made.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, incredibly complicated. So unnecessarily complicated.

**Speaker A:** This is why it's actually, um, you could see that over time that it actually got a few enemies. How can anything be that simple and that easy? And the worst part of it is, is that, and if those people go do that, then I can't make any money off of it. And so stop them Buddhists because they're going to destroy our poor box income.

**Speaker B:** It is, yeah. It's just all about working on your mind yourself. It's completely free, but that's the problem. That's the problem.

**Speaker A:** See that this kind of teaching is absolutely diametrically opposite to all religions. And all business. It's diametrically opposite to all religions and all business, and it's pretty well disagreeable to governments.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it really is.

**Speaker A:** When nobody's interested in the government anymore.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah,

**Speaker A:** that would be a good government is when nobody cares.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're not going to be happy.

**Speaker A:** But people are— in fact, the government and the people in the government really want the people worked up about the government because they wanted to be important to everybody. I mean, can you imagine the Queen of England if she cared? Go to the ball and nobody bothered. They didn't care.

**Speaker B:** I don't care. I'm just But yeah, I imagine she'd be quite upset and gobsmacked if nobody cared.

**Speaker A:** If nobody cared. And yet you walk to the mall and nobody cares.

**Speaker B:** So what gives? She's just a person.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so many people do think that the government is important. The government is not important.

**Speaker B:** No, it's really not.

**Speaker A:** No, the only thing that's important is this next thought. And if my thought is about government, I'm probably having an unwholesome thought about government.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, oh yes, you're going to be having a very unwholesome thought if you're thinking about government. Very unwholesome. Don't be catching yourself thinking about that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so now I think that we can leave it with— this is the way that you practice, is you practice without having thoughts that are unwholesome about, you know, what's happening out there, what used to happen, what happened in the future. No, but you can actually enjoy friendships with the people that work Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, come look at this dude wiggle.

**Speaker B:** Yes, no, my first week has definitely been good. Definitely. Small team, small unit that I'm in. And I've been trying my best to apply the Dharma to what I've been doing. And I think it's been pretty successful, which is great.

**Speaker A:** Great. It actually is easy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it is.

**Speaker A:** All you have to do is remember.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Do anything about that, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Don't have to do a whole lot of remembrance. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll talk to you later then.

**Speaker B:** A little bit more. Something else that I found helping is being in Dharma groups as well, like like your Discord channel and, and whatnot, actually seeing messages about people who are talking about the Dharma, it makes you think, oh, the Dharma, and then you're building upon it even more. And, uh, I spoke to Olivia yesterday as well. We had a discussion about it and everything, and she said she'll call you again very soon.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. I'd like to see her. Yes, yes, yes, that's very good. Yes, to with the, uh, the friends in the Dharma. Have I sent you some, uh, uh, Skype links?

**Speaker B:** Um, I don't think you've sent me links on Skype, but you've sent me the Discord channel, which has, you know, loads and loads of people in it.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, so I, I strongly encourage for people to go to meet each other on Discord and then go off onto Skype or Zoom or whatever they want to do and have conversations at twos and threes at a time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, talking about the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** There's really nothing worth else talking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you talk about it, you think about it, you apply it, and you

**Speaker A:** feel, and it begins to work in a profound way.

**Speaker B:** You—

**Speaker A:** all right, Ben, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, lovely conversation as always. Thank you and speak to you again soon.

**Speaker A:** See you. Okay, tell me all about it. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friend Ben (Speaker B), centers on applying Buddhist practice to everyday life, especially in the context of a new job. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Message: The Simplicity of Correct Practice**
Dhammarato begins and ends by emphasizing that the heart of the practice is simple: **gladden the mind, cheer it up, discard unwholesome thoughts, and cultivate a happy life, one wholesome thought after another.** He laments how this essential truth has been made unnecessarily complicated by cultural and religious institutions.

### **Main Themes and Discussion Points:**

1.  **Attitude Towards Work:** Ben starts a new lab job. Dhammarato advises against seeing it as a "job" with negative connotations (toil, slavery, dissatisfaction). Instead, he encourages viewing it as an opportunity for **exploration, learning, and skill-building**. The right internal attitude transforms external experience.

2.  **Integrating Dhamma into Daily Life:** The central question is how to practice Dhamma while working. The discussion critiques a common **Western "battery" model** of meditation—where one "recharges" in retreat to endure life—as flawed and disconnected. The correct model is a **"hybrid" approach**: frequently "turning on" mindfulness (*sati*) throughout the day to refresh one's joyful state, just as a hybrid car frequently engages its engine.

3.  **The Practice is Moment-to-Moment:** True practice isn't confined to the cushion. It's about **maintaining a wholesome, joyful, and present state of mind** while walking, talking, working, and driving. Formal sitting is for refining this skill so it can be used in "the swamp" of daily life.
    *   **First Jhana as a Baseline:** This "delighted state" can be accessed in many ways: through meditation, discussing Dhamma, reciting Dhamma, or simply reflecting on the teachings during ordinary activities.

4.  **Neurology of Habit:** The talk aligns Dhamma with modern neuroscience. **Unwholesome thoughts strengthen neural pathways.** By actively dismissing them ("be gone with you"), you weaken those pathways. Conversely, cultivating wholesome thoughts strengthens positive pathways, making happiness a natural default.

5.  **Critique of Distractions and Misconceptions:** The speakers identify common distractions from the simple core practice:
    *   **Magical Powers & Celibacy:** Seeking supernatural abilities or linking celibacy to spiritual power is a diversion. Real "power" is the clarity and freedom of the present moment.
    *   **Rebirth & Future Merit:** Excessive focus on past lives or earning merit for a future life can be a form of **escapism**, rooted in the doubt that the present moment can be made "good enough." The emphasis should be on transforming *this* moment.
    *   **Institutional Complexity:** Religions, businesses, and governments often complicate simple truths for control, profit, or importance. The Dhamma is inherently free and liberating, which can threaten these structures.

6.  **The "Log in the Bog" Analogy (MN 36):** The mind is like a waterlogged log in a swamp. To use it (make a boat), you must:
    *   **Take it out of the swamp (seclusion):** Temporarily withdraw to practice.
    *   **Dry it out (drain unwholesome thoughts):** Let unwholesome tendencies drain away.
    *   **Waterproof it (guard the senses):** Develop resilience so negative influences don't re-saturate the mind.
    *   **Return it to the water (engage with the world):** Use your well-prepared mind to navigate life skillfully and joyfully.

7.  **The Role of Community (Sangha):** Ben highlights the importance of **Dhamma friends and groups** (like their Discord channel) for ongoing inspiration, discussion, and support, keeping the practice alive and relevant.

### **Conclusion & Practical Takeaway:**
The path is about **letting go** of burdens moment-by-moment and **choosing to see the marvel in the present**. The practice is to **remember to wake up**, take a deep breath, clear unwholesome thoughts, and cultivate joy—then take that state into all activities. By doing this, work and life become a **celebration**, not a burden. The ultimate instruction is simple: **"Keep the mind wholesome."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about meditation, mindfulness, and integrating Dharma practice into daily life. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Key Metaphors**

1. **Recharging a Battery**  
   - Used to describe a common **Western view of meditation**: you go on a retreat to “recharge” so you can go back into the world with more energy.  
   - Speaker A critiques this as limited, comparing it to **hybrid car technology**—where you need both battery power and the ability to “top up” along the way, implying mindfulness should be continuous, not just occasional.

2. **The Hybrid Car**  
   - Extends the battery metaphor: a hybrid car has a battery but also an engine that can kick in when needed.  
   - Represents the idea of combining **sustained mindfulness** (the battery) with **active, mindful engagement** (the engine turning on) throughout the day.

3. **Taking Piano Lessons vs. Practicing**  
   - Meditation retreats are compared to **taking piano lessons**—you won’t learn to play if you only take lessons without practicing at home.  
   - Emphasizes that meditation must be integrated into daily life, not just done in isolated sessions.

4. **The Log in the Bog** (from a sutta, Majjhima Nikaya 36)  
   - A story told by the Buddha: a waterlogged log won’t catch fire until it’s taken out of the bog and dried in the sun.  
   - Metaphor for the mind: you need to **remove it from distractions** (the bog), **dry out unwholesome thoughts**, and then return it to the world as a useful “boat” (a mindful, joyful mind).

5. **Autopilot vs. Flying the Plane**  
   - Living on “autopilot” means being lost in thought, while **mindfulness is like taking manual control** of the plane.  
   - Encourages actively choosing to be present rather than drifting in habitual thinking.

6. **Sisyphus Pushing the Rock**  
   - Reimagines the myth: instead of struggling to push the rock uphill, Sisyphus could **sit near the top and watch it roll down with curiosity and enjoyment**.  
   - Represents a **shift in attitude**—from resisting life’s burdens to finding joy in the process and letting go.

7. **Water Salinity and Temperature**  
   - Though initially a scientific question, it subtly mirrors the discussion: **external conditions** (like temperature) affect internal states (salinity), just as external job conditions affect mental states—but the mind can be trained to remain balanced.

8. **Building and Waterproofing a Boat**  
   - After “drying out” the mind (like the log), you **waterproof it** so it doesn’t absorb negativity from others.  
   - Relates to developing **emotional resilience** through mindfulness.

---

### **Key Stories & Analogies**

1. **The Cowherder and Rawhide**  
   - Briefly referenced by Speaker B—likely referring to a sutta where the Buddha uses the analogy of a cowherder tending cattle to describe training the mind.  
   - Emphasizes **gradual training and gentle persistence**.

2. **Catholic Celibacy and Magical Powers**  
   - Speaker A tells a story about how **celibacy in Catholicism** was historically tied to property rights, not spiritual power, and jokes that despite centuries of celibacy, no monks fly.  
   - Used to debunk the idea that **extreme asceticism leads to special powers**, stressing that real “power” is clarity and presence.

3. **The Laotian Monk’s Medical Story**  
   - A personal anecdote about a monk misdiagnosed due to the doctor’s **stereotypes about celibacy and health**.  
   - Illustrates how **cultural assumptions** can distort understanding, similar to how meditation is often misunderstood.

4. **The Honeyball Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 18)**  
   - Referenced as describing how **repetitive perceptions cling to the mind** and create habits.  
   - Supports the idea that we can rewire the mind by choosing wholesome thoughts.

5. **Five Ways to Reach First Jhāna** (from Anguttara Nikaya)  
   - Describes five ways to enter a joyful, concentrated state, including **listening to, teaching, reciting, pondering, and mindfully practicing the Dhamma**.  
   - Shows that mindfulness can be cultivated in many activities, not just sitting meditation.

6. **Government and the Queen of England**  
   - A metaphor for **mental clutter**: thinking about government (or external authority) is usually unwholesome and distracting.  
   - The punchline: **“The only thing that’s important is this next thought.”**

---

### **Overall Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors & Stories**

- **Simplicity vs. Complexity**: The Dharma is simple (cultivating happy thoughts), but culture and religion have overcomplicated it.
- **Integration vs. Isolation**: Practice should be woven into daily life, not confined to retreats.
- **Joy as the Foundation**: A cheerful, playful mind is the basis for effective practice.
- **Letting Go**: Freedom comes from releasing burdens, not carrying them.
- **Mind as Changeable**: The brain’s neuroplasticity allows us to reshape habits through mindful intention.

These metaphors and stories help demystify meditation and emphasize its practical, accessible nature.
