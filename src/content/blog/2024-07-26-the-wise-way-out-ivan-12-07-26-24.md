### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Real life. Okay, so it's all about wanting something you don't have, and that's Dukkha. And the example I just gave you, which we'll do it again, is, is that I had a, uh, a Bluetooth keyboard working, and then the G and the H and the I don't work. Dukkha. I can't use this keyboard, got to use an on-screen keyboard. Okay, so I use the on-screen keyboard, and now I can type. So I'll order a new Bluetooth keyboard. Oh, now I've got to wait because it takes a long time. I didn't order it from Bangkok, it came from China, so it took extra time. Dukkha. It didn't come when I wanted it, and then it arrived. Oh, finally. No dukkha. And so I set it up happily and start to use it, and now it's got 3 letters broken— the T, the F, and the C. More Dukkha, right? But between the 2 keyboards, I've got a full keyboard as well as the online keyboard, so not much Dukkha. But they're noticing that you don't like it when the new keyboard comes and already characters are not working. That's the level of Dukkha that we should be at, at the level of— sorry, not the level of Dukkha, but the level of the knowledge of the Dukkha, so that you can come out of the Dukkha immediately. I'll do something about it. It's not because I can see it as Dukkha and then fix it immediately. But can you imagine many people will have that same scenario, and they're really in Dukkha when the new keyboard is broken.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they feel bad, right? Some of you'll feel bad right from the very beginning when the key— when the old keyboard, they recognize that it's got keys not working. Can you imagine somebody actually throwing it across the room because they're angry because the keys don't work, and now none of the keys work?

**Speaker B:** Okay, I can see that happening.

**Speaker A:** Yes, all right. So the question is, is can you— it's not the matter that Dukkha comes. This is the Western mentality. Oh, you should have no Dukkha. But the Buddha didn't teach that. He taught to look and to see, to remember to look. And to see if these thoughts are unwholesome, then make a change. He doesn't say to be dukkha-free because those people who are wanting to be dukkha-free and the dukkha comes, they don't want to know it. They want to rather be fine because they're not supposed to have dukkha. Yes, they'll see the dukkha and then they'll feel bad. Oh no, there is dukkha! Instead of saying, aha, the keyboard doesn't work and I don't like that, and I can see that dukkha right now. Okay, I see you, Mr. Dukkha. Aha, I see that I don't like that the keyboard don't work.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Oh my God, this makes so much sense. I was wrapping my head around this. Oh.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that's the whole point, is, is that we want to wrap our head around no dukkha. And the Buddha doesn't teach no dukkha, he teaches dukkha see it and change it so that this Dukkha, Nirodha. Yes, you will never have a Dukkha-free life until you are really, really sharp and you can see the Dukkha in midair before it even enters the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I was just thinking about how if I didn't practice the Dharma, I would be Instead of just feeling bad for like and catching it and say, oh, I'm feeling Dukkha, I would literally just because of a broken key, my whole day would be ruined. That's crazy looking back how I could let something so small ruin my entire day.

**Speaker A:** That's the Western society. Everybody ruins their day over something really, really small. An example of that is, they'll see a poll where their candidate is down 1 point and the other candidate is up, and they'll feel bad all day. Not recognizing that, number 1, the polls are wrong; number 2 is that polls change. And number 3, polls don't even count. It's the voting that counts. And yet they feel bad because they don't like it because the polls changed a little bit. And the right thing to do is to, when you see that you're watching polls, stop. Stop watching polls because the only thing you're going to get out of a poll is to feel bad So don't watch political polls.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And especially in Malaysia, you can't count on polls there at all, and yet the news is full of them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's always surprised me how Western countries, they are so obsessed over data. Like, I get it, some data helps, but it's like, why are you guys obsessing over it? It doesn't make sense to me. But then again, I think I also subconsciously sometimes do that, like predicting the future that's not grounded in reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not real, is it? Those polls are not real. Watching the polls is not real. Caring about polls is not real. And yet people feel bad because they watch the poll. They'll feel bad about the character on the keyboard not working. The whole society is built upon that. Even in Malaysia, people are trained to, when something goes wrong, never mind how tiny it is, when something goes wrong, we're supposed to not like it and feel bad. We're not getting what we want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I come to a realization that in the past, when something bad happened and then I feel bad and then I say, why do— because I'm still a bit superstition, I believe in God, and I was like, why did God let this happen? But then I realized now it's why do I allow myself to feel bad? Like, I have a choice.

**Speaker A:** Well, okay, that's— you don't have to ask that question because we already know that we allow ourselves to feel bad because that's the habit we're in.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but you don't have to go all the way to feelings. You can see that this, this thought that you're having is Dukkha, and then change it before you even start to feel bad. And all of that Dukkha, with all of that keyboard that I was talking about, there was no room to feel bad. Yes, I could see the Dukkha as it arose, and it's possible to see the Dukkha before it arises. Yes, it is on the way. You probably have seen a movie or two where somebody has a spear thrown at them and they catch it in midair, or you see that an arrow is shot at them and they catch it in midair. Or if you've seen The Matrix, you can see somebody gets shot at with a bullet and they dodge it in midair.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** A lot of sports are like that, okay? I see that with basketball and soccer especially, to where the ball's not going where the guy thought it was going to go.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So that's the whole point, is can you catch that stuff while it's in midair? The answer is not yet, but if you can catch it as it arises, that's good. Because then you don't feel bad, because you can see it at the level of perception and the level of the salyatana without going all the way into Vedana. You've heard about the Paticcasamuppada before, so I'll say at the level of perception we make up a story. Can you see that story as dukkha while you're making it up? If not, you're going to feel bad about the story you just made up.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and then later you can see it as you're making the story up. You can see, hey, I'm making a story that's got Dukkha in it. Let's not make that story. Let's have a different story.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes. Let's have a different story. Um, I've been doing that. I, I sometimes see the story forming up. I was able to choose a story of what's happening right now. It really helps. It's so helpful. I just, I'm not sure, because sometimes maybe it's like I'm using my wisdom to see and then I just cut through it. But not really perfect, sometimes I just—.

**Speaker A:** That wisdom only arises With Sati, you've got to remember to take the wise way out. You got to remember to look at what you're doing so that you can make a change. Otherwise, you're going to perceive Dukkha, you're going to tell a story of Dukkha, and then you're going to feel bad because of the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Then you start to grasp and cling, causing more Dukkha. See, there's a little bit of Dukkha all the way, but we could go all the way into it when there's a birth of the the self. Oh no, my keyboard doesn't work, and now we're in full-blown Dukkha. We have to take the I, me, and my out of it. Nothing is worth clinging to as I, me, or mine, like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says. Yes, you can cling to the keyboard as a keyboard with a broken T, F, and C, but if it's my keyboard that's broken with the T, F, and the C, now there's real Dukkha. Yes, the big heavy stuff. And you— and if you can see that you're making up a story that's got Dukkha in it, you can change that story.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Um, I also just always— I keep remembering what you always said, as in Dharma is like grabbing a snake. Are you grabbing it by the tails or the head? I realize sometimes I grab it by the tails and it bites me back. As in, I ask myself the question, oh, why do I have so much Dukkha? But I remember one of your videos, you say, I've been having Dukkha my whole life. It's just now I only realize that. So I don't really have to go to the pity party.

**Speaker A:** Right, Ken. That's the whole point, is can you catch it? Yes. And you catch it, uh, early. That's like you mentioned about the head of the snake. If you catch the, the snake by the tail, it's probably going to bite you.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, which is the same, same way as saying that if you catch it late Like, for instance, if you catch it, uh, in the sense of Paticcasamuppada, when you catch the Dukkha late, that's because you're already in it. You've already gotten bitten by the snake.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the, uh, if you can catch it by the head means that you catch it at the point of perception.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes.

**Speaker A:** Can you catch it as it's occurring, as it arises? Can you catch it while you're still making the story, or are you going to make up a story and then feel bad about it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that takes sharpness. It takes you to be— the ability to remember, to look at what you're doing. Remember to look at the way that you're making up stories. That's the thinking process, is making up stories.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, everything just clicks.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you can catch it early, no Dukkha. Or if you can catch it very early, just enough Dukkha to see it and then say, 'Aha, I see that.'.

**Speaker B:** I like how you said just enough Dukkha, because sometimes I'm really stubborn. When I'm not mindful, I was like, "Ah, this Dukkha is still okay, let's keep going." Like, I mean, it's so stupid, like my bad habits. I just want to save people.

**Speaker A:** Those habits run deep, that's right. And they're easy to follow. But when you're training yourself, train yourself to listen to the thoughts that you're having, listen to the stories that you're making up. Because if you can see those stories as they're being made up, then you have a choice about how you're going to feel about it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Yeah, I like this because this— the basic is really important, right? Sometimes I still go too far. I was like, okay, is there something I could know more? But maybe this is all I need to know. Yes, yes, yeah, I don't think I have any questions now.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's finish now. You got it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, let's do this quickly. Let's finish.

**Speaker A:** Got it. All right, you're already in Dukkha, wanting stuff you don't have. That's Dukkha. Yes, seeing that you're about to want it, that's wisdom.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, so to just clarify a bit, so I could want something, but it's with wisdom to see that where is this going, right? I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** Right, so if you can see it now, you can say, I can, I'm okay now, I can do without it, I've got options.

**Speaker B:** I got options.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I got options. You got choices. That's the whole point. You've got a choice here. You got a choice about what you're going to do about the keyboard, and you've got a choice about how you're going to feel about the keyboard. Most people behave about the keyboard according to the way they feel because they're not really watching how they feel.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, because sometimes you can watch when you're making up the story so you don't have to feel bad about the story you made up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like sometimes I feel like I don't have option because I just based on my feeling, I feel I really need this. But actually I can think about this, like Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you can practice it.

**Speaker A:** We'll talk to you later about it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, see you.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and Sangha friends:

**Core Teaching:** The talk centers on a practical understanding of **Dukkha** (suffering/stress) and how to relate to it wisely, moving away from the unrealistic goal of a "dukkha-free" life.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Dukkha is Inevitable & Recognizable:** Using the relatable example of a broken keyboard, Dhammarato illustrates that dukkha arises from wanting things to be other than they are (e.g., a working keyboard). The initial frustration is natural dukkha.

2.  **The Goal is Not "No Dukkha," but "Seeing Dukkha":** The Buddha's path is not about eliminating all dukkha from life, but about developing the **mindful awareness (sati)** to recognize it early. The Western ideal of a perfectly happy, dukkha-free life is a misunderstanding that leads to more suffering when dukkha inevitably appears.

3.  **Catch Dukkha Early ("Grab the Snake by the Head"):** The crucial skill is to catch the arising of dukkha at the level of **perception and thought**, *before* it develops into strong feeling and emotional reaction.
    *   **Late Catch (Tail of the Snake):** You feel full-blown anger, ruin your day, or throw the keyboard. You've been "bitten" by dukkha.
    *   **Early Catch (Head of the Snake):** You notice the thought, "I don't like this; the keyboard is broken," and see it *as dukkha*. This recognition itself gives you a choice.

4.  **Change the Narrative:** Once you see the dukkha-laden story forming in your mind ("My keyboard is broken and now I can't work!"), you have the wisdom to **change the story**. You can choose a narrative that acknowledges the problem but focuses on options and solutions ("I have other ways to type; I'll order a new one").

5.  **You Always Have a Choice:** The practice reveals that you are not a slave to your feelings. Between a stimulus (broken keyboard) and your reaction (anger), there is a space where mindfulness and wisdom can operate. You can choose how to perceive the situation and thus how to feel about it.

**Practical Takeaways:**
*   **Train yourself** to listen to your thoughts and the stories you're creating in real-time.
*   **Remember to look** at your mental process. This mindfulness is what allows wisdom to arise.
*   The **basic practice** is this moment-to-moment recognition and course-correction. This is foundational and profoundly powerful.
*   Apply this to all of life's small irritations (keyboards, political polls) to prevent them from causing disproportionate suffering.

**Conclusion:** The path is about developing the sharpness to see dukkha as it arises, understanding its nature, and using that awareness to skillfully navigate life's inevitable frustrations with clarity and choice, rather than being overwhelmed by them.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several powerful metaphors and stories to explain the Buddhist concept of **Dukkha** (suffering, stress, dissatisfaction) and how to work with it mindfully.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Broken Keyboards (Primary Story)**
This is the central, extended story used to illustrate the arising and cessation of Dukkha in everyday life.
*   **The Scenario:** Speaker A's Bluetooth keyboard breaks (letters G, H, I stop working). He uses an on-screen keyboard and orders a new one. The wait for delivery is Dukkha. When the new keyboard arrives, it also has broken keys (T, F, C). More Dukkha.
*   **The Lesson:** The story shows Dukkha is not about eliminating problems, but about **recognizing dissatisfaction the moment it arises**. The ideal is to see the broken keys, note "this is Dukkha," and pragmatically solve it (e.g., use both keyboards) without adding a layer of emotional suffering ("Why me? This ruins my day!").

### 2. **Catching Arrows, Spears, or Bullets in Midair (The Matrix)**
This is a key metaphor for **intercepting Dukkha early** in the mental process.
*   **The Image:** Like a movie hero catching a spear or Neo in *The Matrix* dodging a bullet, the goal is to catch the "spear" of unwholesome thought *before* it hits you and causes full-blown suffering.
*   **The Lesson:** You can't always stop Dukkha from arising, but with mindfulness (**Sati**), you can see it at the level of perception and thought ("a story is forming") and change course *before* it develops into painful feeling (**Vedana**) and clinging.

### 3. **Grabbing a Snake by the Head or Tail**
This metaphor, attributed to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, illustrates the **skillfulness of addressing the root cause**.
*   **Grabbing the Tail:** If you address Dukkha late (e.g., when you're already deep in self-pity or anger), it's like grabbing a snake by the tail—it will whip around and **bite you**. You're already caught in the suffering.
*   **Grabbing the Head:** Catching Dukkha at its origin—at the moment of **perception** and the initial "story-making"—is like grabbing the snake by the head. You **neutralize it** safely and prevent the bite (the subsequent emotional pain).

### 4. **Obsessing Over Political Polls**
This is a societal story illustrating how we **create unnecessary Dukkha** from unreal or unimportant things.
*   **The Scenario:** People feel bad all day because a political poll shows their candidate down by one point.
*   **The Lesson:** The Dukkha comes from clinging to a desire for a specific outcome (my candidate must be winning) based on **unreal data** (polls are often wrong, they change, they aren't the actual vote). The wise action is to see the craving and the unwholesome thought pattern ("I'm watching this to feel secure") and **stop feeding it**—"stop watching polls."

### 5. **Sports Analogy (Basketball/Soccer)**
A quick metaphor to reinforce the idea of **anticipating and adapting**.
*   **The Image:** In sports, players must constantly adjust because "the ball's not going where the guy thought it was going to go."
*   **The Lesson:** Life is similar. Things don't go as planned (like a keyboard breaking). The skill is in seeing the deviation (the arising Dukkha) early and **adjusting your position/response** without frustration.

### 6. **The "Pity Party" vs. Simple Recognition**
This is a metaphorical description of two possible mental paths.
*   **The Unskillful Path:** Going to a "pity party"—asking "Why do I have so much Dukkha?" or "Why did God let this happen?" This is **clinging to the story** of suffering, which amplifies it.
*   **The Skillful Path:** Simply noting, "Aha, Dukkha is here. I've had it my whole life, now I just see it." This is **recognizing the universal pattern** without personalizing it, which allows you to let it go.

### Summary of Core Teachings Through Metaphor:
*   **Dukkha is Inevitable:** Like broken keyboards and delayed packages, life will have frustrations.
*   **The Goal is Not "No Dukkha":** The Western ideal of a pain-free life is a trap. The goal is to **see Dukkha clearly**.
*   **Freedom is in the Gap:** The key is to create a gap between **stimulus** (broken key) and **full emotional reaction** (a ruined day) by catching the thought "in midair."
*   **You Always Have a Choice:** You can choose the story you tell. Instead of " *My* keyboard is broken and *I* am victimized," you can choose "There is a broken keyboard. I have options to solve this."
*   **Wisdom is Early Detection:** Using mindfulness to see the very first thought-stories that contain craving or aversion, and changing them *before* they lead to suffering.
