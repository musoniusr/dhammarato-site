### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so we have started the call. This is Sunday afternoon at 4 PM. Several of us are here in Thailand. Uh, Ivan is in Malaysia, uh, so it's late afternoon for us, but it's mid-morning in, uh, the UK. So, Philip, you've got a question. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** My question is how to gladden the mind when you're with other people.

**Speaker A:** All right. And, uh, Dewey Chan, what's your question? You turned your mic off. You turned it on to turn it off.

**Speaker C:** Sorry.

**Speaker D:** Um, There are, within Mahayana, there's different interpretations of this idea to save all sentient beings. But one interpretation that's quite well known through the sixth patriarch of Zen, who wrote the— well, he's the person who spoke in the Platform Sutra. His interpretation was that we're not trying to save other sentient beings necessarily, but we're trying to save ourselves by.

**Speaker A:** By some combatants of Sankhara. Do you know what.

**Speaker B:** Century?

**Speaker A:** Do you know what century you're talking about?

**Speaker D:** This has got to be well over 1,000 years, I think.

**Speaker A:** Okay, because that's curious. All right. So the way to get started on this is, do you guys realize that you're actually asking the same question? It's just differently stated. Well, why— all right, Philip, why are you around other people? That's start with Why are you around other people when you can't gladden your own mind when you're around them, but you can do it when you're alone? So why do you go around other people?

**Speaker B:** Either because I like them or because I have to work.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you can work and be in the same building with people, but you don't have to be around them in the sense of among them. That you can just spend your time gladdening your own mind. You don't have to pay attention to them. So in fact, there's quite a lot about Buddhism in the sense of our relationship to ourself versus relationship to others. And that One way of talking about it, uh, uh, is that.

**Speaker B:** Uh, we.

**Speaker A:** Don'T need to save ourselves. We're already saved. You're already good enough. You don't need to be saved. What you need, in fact, is to stop thinking that you need to be saved, that in fact needing to be saved is a kind of bondage. That we need something and that going around other people actually is putting us in danger. What is the danger? Of being around unwholesome, ordinary people who do not know that they're already okay. It's better to associate with those who already know they're all right, they're okay. Maybe that will start to rub off. The problem with most of the Westerners that are like in Philip's condition that have jobs is that you go, let us say, in and out and in and out of society. And a better thing to do is to get out of society long enough to where it no longer has any influence on you. The Buddha had in Sutta number 36 the simile about a tree in the swamp. Being an old Southern boy, we have the expression the log in the bog. Where the cypress tree or whatever tree that was in the bog fell over when it died. And now it's in the bog. So the question that the Buddha raised is he says is that in fact, in the time of the Buddha, they had professional firemakers who would go around to make fires for people who needed a fire. Now we have a lighter, easy enough. We don't have to go around rubbing two sticks together. We've got acetylene torches. We've got all kinds of ways of making fire. But in the time of the Buddha, it was hard enough to do that people were actually holding that a profession. So somebody who really knows what they're doing— did he leave? No, here he is over the corner. Well, if you turn your camera off. So, um, the log in the bog is, is can anyone, a fire maker, go and set a log on fire that's in the bog? Is that true, Philip? Can he go and set that log on fire in the bog? It's waterlogged.

**Speaker B:** Not, not if it's wet, then you have to first get it out.

**Speaker A:** All right, if they take that log out of the bog and bring it up onto the shore, can the professional fire maker set that log on fire?

**Speaker B:** Not until it's dried.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly what we're getting at, and it takes time and sunlight and gravity to pull the moisture out of the log so that it's dried out enough so that it can be set on fire. Now, let's say that a log is in fact dragged out of the bog and a little bit of it can be set on fire. If we put that log back into the swamp, back into the fire, excuse me, back into the water Is it in danger of having the fire go back out?

**Speaker B:** Yes, because it's not striated.

**Speaker A:** All right, this is what we're getting at, is that this is the reason why it's better to stay out of the bog if you can. This is part of the reason that the Buddha actually started the Bhikkhu Sangha. Was to give people the opportunity to leave the society, to get away from it, so that they could in fact find their own liberation by drying out. Now, one of the ways that I talk about it is, is that whenever someone goes into seclusion, getting away from the society, they begin fairly soon to realize that they brought the society with them. That's exactly the same thing as in the analogy that when you take the log out of the bog, it brings its own bog with it. It brings its own bog with it, even though you've taken it out of the swamp, it's still got swamp in it. One of the expressions that I've heard many times, you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy. Recently we've been saying, you can take the German out of Germany, but you can't take the German out of the German. But if he stays out of Germany long enough, maybe some of that Germany will start to evaporate, or drip out the bottom. But if that German goes back to Germany, He's going to be wet with German again, and his fire will go back out. So seclusion has its value, and yet Westerners say, oh, well, I can go sit down in a meditation hall and do a retreat or something for 5 or 10 days and get all dried out. And then what do they do? Go right back into society. What we need to do instead is find a way of insulating ourselves. Maybe you can get that log a nice paint job, waterproof paint, so that he can go into the bog again and not be completely saturated with society again. And so that's basically the question that you're asking, is how can you give yourself a new kind of paint job so that you don't get bogged down with all of the world, the issues of all of the people? Does that sound more like your question?

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I think in fact you're right. Because when I gladden the mind first and everything is all right, I don't get bogged down with stuff. It's just if it— if I'm not letting the mind beforehand, then it's difficult to gladden the mind after. But if you do it beforehand, it's easier to not get bogged down with stuff.

**Speaker A:** But when you go back into society, there are going to be people there who are going to spray more— more or less, they're going to spray society all over you. And what you can do with that is, is that you cannot let it in. Or more specifically, you can take a hike, you can get out of the room, you can go to the toilet. Oh, I gotta go. I strongly recommend that people stay away from ordinary people with ordinary problems, especially when those ordinary people with ordinary problems are having a conflict, which is quite often. In fact, a lot of society is dealing with conflict. People don't get along together. They would rather be right, even if they have to beat the tar out of the other guy to prove that they're right. And the Buddha would recommend to stay away from conflict areas. So if two people are arguing, the right thing to do is to move away from them. Don't listen to what they have to say. And guess what? Both of them in that argument will try to draw you in so that you can agree with them and they'll win the argument. But guess what? Nobody ever won an argument. It's not possible to win an argument. Why? Because the other guy who is arguing with you is trying to win the argument too. And so he doesn't want to lose the argument. That's why people argue, is because they want to be right. And the Dhamma dude can see that and say, hey, I'm already okay. I don't have to argue with other people, that I can get out of the war zone. Another— actually, there are 4 places where the Buddha recommends that it's not wise to stay, and one is a famine, which would mean people are having a pity party. They don't have any food of joy at all. They're all miserable, and the best thing to do is to leave before they rob you of your food of joy, your sustenance. Take a hike. Another one is in an area of disease and pestilence. Stay out of that place. If people have a poisoned mind, if they have a mental disease, They're going to do their best to give it to you. It's like the spiritual disease is the most communicable disease there is. Richard Dawkins called it mimes or whatever, memes, that bad ideas spread. And the thing to do is to stay away from other people's bad ideas. Yes, Kat, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Oh, sorry, I didn't say anything. Maybe I wasn't muted, or I— your.

**Speaker A:** Blue bar around your frame flashed. So anyway, this whole story about the log in the bog means that it is better if you're going to see the light of day, if you're going to be able to do something, wholesome, you need to stay away from all of the unwholesome stuff as best you can. We have to insulate ourselves from it rather than trying to fix it. When I was in Washington, D.C. as a monk, one of the things that was very interesting is that a lot of people and politicians, they wanted the monks to go around and introduce them. I think that in fact that they were seeing that they were getting some value. And so one of the things that happened was that we took a tour of the basement of the Library of Congress, where they had a bunch of stuff that was stolen. I don't know who stole it, but it was stolen from Asia, a lot of old antique scriptures and things like that. And the guy who was running the tour was very proud that the Library of Congress was at best a fence, and more than likely was participating in the theft of all of these artifacts that had come from Asia. But one of the points about that is, is that while I was in Washington, I often saw in various offices a line drawing. And that line drawing has a picture of a guy that is in the swamp and surrounded by alligators. And the caption of that is that it's hard when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp. And for some reason or another, I think partly because of Christianity and maybe Islam, that they both have the concept of the idea is that the world is swampy and it's our job to drain the swamp. Christians actually have to proselytize. They have to go out and spray their Christianity all over people. They're almost required to do it. The same thing for Islam. They've got to have a jihad. They've got to go have a war. They've got to conquer the world, make a caliphate worldwide so that everybody will conform to their belief system. And so that kind of mentality is built in, but it's been built into many cultures. It's been built into the Chinese system. This is what the Mahayana practice is all about, that they call— they run under two different systems of belief that are actually interrelated. One is called the Bodhisattva vow. Is anybody here? Kat, do you know what the Bodhisattva vow.

**Speaker B:** Is?

**Speaker C:** I remember as taking some kind of 10 vows to say, I will save all sentient beings before I myself get enlightened.

**Speaker A:** So that's more or less it, right? And, and that's very Mahayana, but it's not Zen at all. But it is the Mahayana. And the joke is, is that imagine that there are 10,000 Bodhisattvas in the world, and they've been working really hard and struggling really hard, and they've got everybody else in the world enlightened. They've got everybody else through the pearly gates, and now they're standing outside arguing with one another: "You go next." "I'm going to be the last one here." "You go." "No, you go." How can they have that? That's really interesting that they would have that kind of a vow. That everybody else has got to become enlightened before I do, what that's just saying is, hey, I'm going to sit back and do nothing because there is no possible way that everybody is going to become enlightened. And with that, I don't have a chance. So the Bodhisattva vow is actually quite ridiculous in every regard that you can think of, and yet it's very, very common in the Mahayana tradition, especially in China. But the Zen has a different perspective on that, and that is that within Zen, the Zen is that each one of you is already enlightened. Just sit here. This is Zazen, is just sit, because you don't have to do anything. You're already there. Now, within the concept of the Mahayana, as opposed to the Hinayana— in fact, I thought it was very humorous. I had a good friend, senior monk Maha Samskara in Wat Greensboro, that threw around the word Hinayana easily. And it's supposed to be a slur. The Hinayana is the little boat and the Mahayana is the big boat. And he was happy with his little boat and used the word Hinayana often. Now here's the point. Imagine that the Mahayana, the big boat, is sort of like a cruise liner, like a carousel. Or maybe Walt Disney ship. And the point is, is that if you're going to go on this cruise liner, one thing is that you've got to do what you're told to do. You got to stand in line for your tickets, you got to stay in the cabin that they want. But the important thing is, is that you're a guest on this boat and you're not rowing. You expect that the boat people to get you there, to where you can think of the Hinayana is like a canoe, and all you need is to get in your canoe with your paddles and go wherever you want to go. So the problem with the Mahayana is, is that they spend all of their time on the, uh, at the port loading up. And then when they're out at sea, they're just messing around, eating a lot of food, gambling, entertainment, all of that kind of stuff. But the boat itself never gets to the other shore. That's the problem with the Mahayana, is that it's overcrowded with people who are expecting the boatman to get them there, including the boatman. Everybody's a passenger on the Mahayana, and nobody's rowing. But if you're on your own boat, you've got your paddles, you know that it's up to you. And so that's part of the point about the Mahayana. And so here comes the Bodhisattva saying, oh well, I'm going to stay on this boat until it reaches its destination, and then I'm going to be the last one off. I'm not going to be on board anymore. I'm going to stay on board until everybody else is off the boat. The problem is that the boat, the Mahayana boat, doesn't ever get anywhere because they don't even know where they're going. And they're just sitting there expecting somebody else to do it for them. Now, in a way, in reality, there's a kind of a combination in the sense that we need to go into seclusion. We need to get our own little canoe and paddle to the other shore, get our own raft together and get going, move out of our Dukkha, come out of our misery and suffering, and come to the other shore. In that regard, now we know how to build canoes, we know how to paddle them, so now we can teach other people, one person at a time, how to canoe. And so one person at a time in their own canoe can come to the other shore. But all of those people who are waiting at the other port for the big boat to carry them, they're not going to get anywhere. That in fact, I make sure that I'm not saying that everyone who is in a Mahayana temple and practicing that don't get anywhere, because within the Mahayana tradition, there are huge, huge numbers of people who have given up standing in line to get on the Mahayana and have in fact gotten their own boat. But in fact, probably the best example that I have is the Dalai Lama. He didn't wait for all of the others to become enlightened. He went ahead and did it all by himself. So, this is the problem with the Mahayana, is that they expect— and in fact, I see that the Mahayana tradition is very, very similar to Christianity, in the sense that the Mahayana want a savior. They want a Bodhisattva to come save them, and the Bodhisattva can't even save himself, because he's too busy waiting for you to get saved somehow. And here we have in Christianity, oh, you've got to have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck or you're going to wreck your truck. You need a Jesus, you need a savior, you can't save yourself. Except that in the actual teachings of the Buddha, there is not only the possibility that you can save yourself, but here is the Eightfold Noble Method to We can do it, and all we have to do is to practice the Eightfold Noble Path. That's it. Now, the point is that we cannot practice the Eightfold Noble Path while we're standing in line with all of the others who are waiting for the bell to ring, waiting for the ship to leave, waiting for the Mahayana Bodhisattvas to come save them. That the entire society is looking for help. Very, very few people will actually take the responsibility that they individually have to fix their own mind. This is actually what the Second Noble Truth really is all about, and it's so important for us to recognize that you yourself individually got yourself into the mess that you're in, and only you yourself can come out of the mess by first off recognizing to stop making the mess and to say, I'm not messy. Stop having the messy thoughts and start having happy, wholesome thoughts. And when we have happy, wholesome thoughts, we're not in a mess anymore. It's a very simple practice. One stroke of that oar at a time, one stroke at a time. This is happy thought, this is a happy thought, this is a wholesome thought. One after another after another. But many people start to do that and then they'll take the oar out of the water and says, oh, poor me, this is so much work. I want a great big boat for somebody else to come save me. Where's my place on that big boat? And the right thing to do is to put your paddle back in the water, to start watching what your mind is doing, and to start to practice with right noble effort to change your own mind. So Philip, getting back to the point that you were making, is that yes, so long as you're standing in line with all of those people who want you or somebody else to help them You're getting polluted. It's better to stay away from those people. And if you can't stay away from them physically, at least stay away from them mentally. But it's better to stay away from them physically because they'll do their darndest to make you responsible for the mess that they're making. Now that goes back also to the point is that if you are personally responsible for all of your own unwholesome, unhappy thoughts Arahant, then they are too. You can't save them. You can only save yourself. And even after you are saved, whatever that means, they've still got to do it themselves. You can't save them. Only they can do that. They're going to have to drag their own log out of the bog. Let it drain out, and then to set them, uh, their enlightenment fire all on their own. And all they really need to, uh, for that is to recognize that that's the task. All those logs in the bog hope somehow that someone else is going to take the water out of the bog. So going back to that point about when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember your original intention was to drain the swamp. You can't drain the swamp. The swamp is there and you can't drain it. The best thing for you to do is to get out of the swamp and don't go back in. Stay out of the swamp. And you say, oh well, I've got to have a job. Well, now we can go and change the topic. Well, do you really have to have a job? And some will say, oh well, you gotta eat to live and you gotta work to eat. Well, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 people on this call right now that know that's not true. Kat, do you work for a living, or do you eat without having to work at, let us say, IBM, or drive a truck, or do something like a job?

**Speaker C:** Well, I just sort of stand in front of a house and people put the food in my bowl nowadays, you know.

**Speaker A:** So it's quite easy.

**Speaker C:** It's fairly easy now, but I know the kind of thought of, "Oh, I have to do that, I have to make money, I have to, I have to," that kind of rule that we learn. It seems impossible, like it's impossible that such a thing exists, I don't have to work, but— Yeah. There are places you can go and you don't have to really, people will take care of you very well.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact they want you to, they want to take care of you because in somehow or another if they take care of you, you'll save them from their sin. And you can't do that, but you can eat the foods that they offer. And if they want to really know real Dharma, you can tell them all about it happily. Let them go save themselves, knowing that if they get on the robe and the bowl and go out on Venerable Bodhisattva, somebody else is going to feed them. And so, Philip, maybe you don't have to work. Maybe that is a fallacy. Maybe, in fact, that's been proposed by the aristocracy, the big money, the bosses, the government people, the kings and the popes, who have told you that lie so that they can get you to work So they don't have to. And maybe you don't have to work. They say, oh, you can't get on the big boat if you don't work. You got to stand in line, you got to pay your dues. And the answer is, hey, you don't need to get on that boat. You can live a beautiful life. You can eat, you don't have to work, then in fact, here's a point: look at the difference between how much money you make at the job versus how much it costs to eat. So why don't you do it this way? Why don't you eat and live simply and save all the rest of the money all month long? Month after month, and pretty soon you've got so much cash that you can eat for years off the money that you didn't spend for all the other stuff to maintain the job. That the job actually costs more money to have a job than often that you even make on the job. Some people have to wear business suits, some people have to travel in a car, some people have to to show themselves in a certain way in order to get the job. And then the amount of money that they're paid on that job is very little. I mean, the big business, they don't want to pay you. They don't even pay you what you're worth. So I would highly recommend people that's got a job to review that you don't have to work. You can in fact get away with it. You can come and stay in a kuti next to Kat. You can come and hang out on the porch. Come live with me. We've got enough. David, you're staying at Wat Suwan Mok. Do you eat over there? I mean, they've got a kitchen, don't they?

**Speaker E:** Yes, they do.

**Speaker A:** Do you, do you have to, um, uh, pave their streets to get to be fed? No, there's no paving at Tawatsuan Monastery. Do you have to cut down their trees in order to get fed? No.

**Speaker E:** The food's really good.

**Speaker A:** Say what?

**Speaker E:** The food is really good.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a matter of opinion. So, Philip, in this regard, you've got new choices to make. That you can in fact spend more time in seclusion. You can in fact spend time practicing Anapanasati, get your mind in such a good state that you can go around those other people and they can't get to you. But a better decision is, why don't you get your mind straightened out in seclusion where you don't have to deal with those people because they're not there for your benefit and you're not there for their benefit. You're there because you are under the, uh, delusion of a lie that you've been told. And you can be happy and smart and not hold a job. Now, the thing that I find amusing is that there was a time when I was a monk at Wat Soan Mokkh having the thoughts of, "Oh, well, I'm a big whoop-de-doo computer scientist. I've got a Master's degree in electrical engineering. I could go back to the United States and get a job easy." And then I remember, oh yeah, and I'll buy all of the crap that goes along with getting that job. Then the thought comes, look, you're wasting your time here. And now I recognize, oh no, after years later, I'm really satisfied that I didn't go back and get that job. I could have been a wealthy man. I would say that I've suffered the loss of $10 million in lost salary over the course of a lifetime, over the course of the past 40 years. My salvation has cost me $10 million, and I paid it.

**Speaker B:** Happily.

**Speaker A:** Why? Because if I had had that money, it would have been spent, it would have been gone, and I would have been just as miserable as I always was. Another way that I put it is, is that if Ajahn Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had given me big bags of gold rather than the Dhamma, then I would have probably squandered that gold and been just as bad off 40 years later without that gold. But he gave me a gift that was priceless. And the best part about it is, is that I didn't squander it. But here you are having that job thinking that you gotta eat to live, but you're squandering most of the money that you make.

**Speaker B:** I mean, one thing that is good though is that I can be in my little boat because I have the money to be in my little boat.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you've got the money, then come live in Thailand and be generous. Give David some real food so he's not eating that crap thinking that it's great. But that's the way of looking at it, is if you've got already savings, then retire early. Why just keep on making money and making money and making money because most of it you squander anyway? On a house, on a car, on clothing that you don't need. All of the shirts that I had— I— that I have now, all of the shirts that I have now, with a couple of exceptions of people buying gifts, were purchased right after I, uh, stopped being a monk in 2008, I would say into 2009. And guess what? I've still got all of them. But I don't wear them. I didn't need them then, but I went on a shopping spree at Walmart, bought a bunch of clothes I didn't need, hardly ever wore. I've got a couple of shirts there that have never been worn, and they were bought in 2009. What does that make them? 15 years old in the closet, never worn them. I bet you've got clothes that you throw out before you wear them out. That's why Goodwill exists, because people get rid of clothes when in fact they don't need clothes. We wear clothes because we're told to wear clothes, because the society wears clothes. And all those clothes do is try to make you feel like you're something when in fact You can feel like something without any clothes. The clothing, all we need is clothing, is to ward off flies, to keep ourselves protected from the cold, to not expose ourselves. That's all we need for clothing. And yet look at the fashion industry over the past several hundred years. Look how fancy the dress. I mean, they used to wear great big white powdered wigs. All kinds of stuff that people have been wearing over the years, and we don't need any of that stuff. Just something simple, like the easy robe that, uh, uh, Kat is wearing right now. Just a piece of cloth, lasts for years. Washed by hand. Everything is easy. And yet most people who have jobs have a thing called a closet full of clothes that they can't wear all at the same time. What would you look like if you put on all the clothes you own right now all at the same time when you only need one shirt? So this is why I'm saying that you're squandering a lot of the money, because you've got a wardrobe and you've got cars and you spend all kinds of money, when in fact the original intention was to eat. And you can eat without a job, so you don't really have to associate with all of those people who were stupid enough to think that they've got to work to eat. You don't have to buy the lie that they're buying. You can take it easy. And so here, back to the question that you were saying, is, is that yes, the Zen is completely different. From the Mahayana, because the good Zen master says you've already got it. There's no reason to try to get on the big boat, because the big boat's not going anywhere. It's too busy gaining passengers. Never leave support. You got to go out and get your own canoe and go happily rowing yourself So that's the way that we do it. And pretty soon you recognize, hey, I don't have to row so much, I don't have to go so far. Let me just put this boat into whatever port there is and I'll be happy right there. The real journey is to cross the flood of desire, to cross the flood of ignorance, to cross the flood of hatred and ill will that we manufacture. There is the simile of the raft, that one can make a raft, get on that, cross the flood, go to the other shore, and then abandon the raft We don't have to use the raft as a religion and pray to it, oh, I'm so happy that this raft has saved my life. We're still putting that raft on the, uh, on straps and strapping it to your back and carrying it around everywhere we go. We can just gain our freedom and then we can put down all the objects. We don't have to carry that canoe. We don't have to accumulate all those possessions. We're already okay. But we have to practice being already okay because our society has lied to us and told us that you're not okay and you've got to have a job. You're not okay and you've got to join the religion. You're not okay, and you've got to vote. You're not okay, and you got to wear clothes. And wearing clothes and getting a job and voting and all of that stuff doesn't make anybody okay. They're all still not okay. The only thing that's going to get you to become okay is for you to remember that you're already okay. And so that Zen master was correct. Not only is he correct in the sense that you've got to save yourself, if he's Zen, he's saying you don't even need to save yourself. You're already saved, you just don't know it. You're telling yourself lies like, I'm not saved yet, when in fact you already are. You're already okay. Ross, what do you think about that?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, I think I agree with a lot of what you're saying. It's one thing that's kind of— as you've been speaking, it's made me realize how probably the translation 'save' is a very bad translation, because in Chinese when they say the chant, this, the Four Bodhisattva Vows, the verb that they've translated to save is do, but actually there's no other way, there's no other time where they use that to mean save. It's just somebody's translated as this, so I feel even the word save is kind of almost not, it's not what he's trying to say. It's like almost means like to pass something or go through something. About released.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, probably. Free.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think it's something you've mentioned before about a lot of suttas when they were translated, they were translated by Christians, and I think this might be another sort of thing where it's this kind of the meanings change and it kind of, yeah, it's in the past it's maybe made it seem to mean something else to me. And once it's spoken through, you can kind of see, actually, there's something missing here.

**Speaker A:** So if you know how to practice correctly, either through the Theravada or the Zen or the Mahayana, there are correct practice. The teaching of the Buddha is in all of those various cultures. That what Westerners do when they see Tibetan Buddhism, what they actually see is Tibetan culture. Just like when we think of Zen, we're much more likely to see Japanese culture than we are actually the Zen itself. The same thing with Thailand, that people are much more likely to see just the Thai culture than they are to see the Buddha Satsangha. But the good part about it is, is that these Asian societies are actually much closer to the teachings of the Buddha than Western society, that they've been Buddhist for centuries. And because of that, they begin to understand that that big Mahayana boat really is up to each individual one to figure out that they're already okay. They don't need the big boat. That's what I find in Thailand, is that the people here are very different. This is a very different culture. They're very family-oriented. And one of the striking things about it is that in the West, we have to improve according to the society standards. In Thailand, everybody is already set in their place in society. The only job they have to do is to learn to be happy and satisfied in the position they're already in. It's sort of like the difference between a network, and all we have to do is just be happy that we're in the network, as opposed to Western society is much more like a pyramid that you're supposed to climb, stepping on others on the way up, and also others stepping on you, or worse still, pulling you from the— they're below you, and so they grab a hold of your leg and pull you down so that they can get a leg up. And so if you can recognize that you don't live in a hierarchy, there's no place to go. You're already right where you are. All you have to do is just to be happy where you are. You're already okay. You're already in the right place. Can you practice being okay right where you are? Can you do that, Philip? Can you just be happy? You don't have to quit the job to be happy if you can be happy where you are in the job. The problem is, is that when you don't have happiness, or when it's spotty and not there secure, you're going to let all of those unhappy people stress you out. Because you listen to them, you go back into that bog and you're not waterproof.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I practice this. All I need is the next breath, right? That's all I need.

**Speaker A:** All you need is what?

**Speaker B:** All I need is the next breath. That's all I need. I have everything. I just need this next breath.

**Speaker A:** That's all we need to stay alive. But sometime you're not going to get that next breath, and then it's all over. But so long as you're alive and able to breathe, continue to breathe. That's all you really need to do. Everything else is okay just the way that it is. So Thomas, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** Not more than to just enjoy this right here. Nowhere to go, nowhere else to be, nothing more to say.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Ivan? You got something to say? Oh, not really.

**Speaker F:** I'm just laughing at a lot of things he said.

**Speaker A:** Ivan, I have watched you go through a major transformation. Congratulations. Congratulations. No more questions. You're already okay. You can see that now, finally. Excellent.

**Speaker F:** I think everything is okay is such a transformative understanding, I guess, because.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker F:** Logical mind always will find something. But I realize that everything is okay is something beyond that. I'm not sure how to express it, but it is It's nice to experience it.

**Speaker A:** All right. I'm not sure how to say the name. A-U-R-E-L-E-N.

**Speaker G:** It's Aurelian, yeah. But I'm great.

**Speaker B:** I'm feeling just fine.

**Speaker A:** Aurelian, right. Aurelian. Now I remember. Okay.

**Speaker G:** I'm feeling just fine. As I should be.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay. Everything is fine. Great. How about Carl? You got something to say?

**Speaker H:** I got nada.

**Speaker A:** Nothing. Nothing. Not a thing. Nothing to it. Everything is all right. How about you, Kat? Yeah, your mic is off. I mean, your phone. Now it's off again.

**Speaker C:** Is it on?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I— what's interesting for me is like because I'm really in this experience, I do find it hard to sort.

**Speaker B:** Of.

**Speaker C:** Express the experience to other people. Like someone asked me yesterday, what's bindabhat like? And I said, well, it's like this, you know, you go to someone's house and you walk here and you go there and you sort of do this and this. But I was like, it's really an experience. I just don't know how to I don't know how to express it or talk about it, you know what I mean? It's too hard.

**Speaker A:** You're only talking about a very small part.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You're not talking about the mindfulness of all the monks walking in a line. In fact, you go to Vinaya with Ajahn Metta, right?

**Speaker C:** No, usually, well, me and another monk, we head to another village. He goes on another route, but sometimes I go with him.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, and so you're watching where you're going. You go barefoot, you know the path very well.

**Speaker C:** How, yeah, how to explain all the walking barefoot on the rocks and looking at the people, you know, people talking, putting food in your bowl, and sort of, uh, you know, the whole experience. It's hard for me to, to talk about that, and I know many people here probably weren't in Thailand or haven't haven't even been to maybe a wat before. So I find it interesting to see how you talk about it and to them, you know, I find that interesting. It's such an experience though, it's such an experience, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I remember one of the things that I saw was that in the neighborhood that Ajaan Poh would take the route, where I would go with him is the people were very, very poor compared to what I had thought about, in the sense of, hey, I could feed these people and here they are feeding me. Yes, yeah, that I could give these people much better food than they're giving me. But I learned to become grateful But the food that I was getting, whether it was a half-eaten banana or maybe half of a small fish that somebody had eaten half of and put the other half in my bowl— leftovers. But they were generous. They would give what they had to give.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, probably what I get now is probably a little bit different than what you get, but Still now, even most of what I get is eggs and fish and rice. And I started— was pissy about that for a while, and then I caught myself being pissy about that. I was like, okay, this is just, you know, this is all right. Yeah, it's that contentedness.

**Speaker A:** And you have sauces too? Eggs and fish and rice and some bananas and sauces and things like that, and it's okay? I mean, you look healthy to me. So everything is just fine. And look at the fact that that leaves you with so many hours a day with no responsibility to do something that somebody else wants you to do. You can do what you like to.

**Speaker B:** Do.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that marvelous? To where Philip, with a job, he's got to conform to a whole lot of bog. You got to go to work and get to work and wear clothes they expect you to wear and talk like they expect you to talk, etc., like that. And oftentimes these businesses are a war zone. They're in a hurry. They set deadlines. They want you to work. Yeah, Carl, go ahead.

**Speaker H:** You probably need a, like, a Dhamma dude job. You need to find— I'm kind of working like that job where I'm working by myself and I don't have to deal with a lot of people. I think it's good. And when you do deal with them, you're already kind of in a wholesome state, so it becomes very very easy, you don't get bombarded.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the right way.

**Speaker H:** Also the job pays very little and it's also very little hours, but it's enough to survive. It's not more, not less than I need, yeah. So that's my kind of Anicca.

**Speaker C:** Surviving happily.

**Speaker H:** Working in the world, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so our society teaches us that the more you make, the better off you are. The harder you work, the more you make, the better off you are. But that's a lie. Getting by with very little and doing it happily, that's the real way to do it, is just enjoy life. What do you think, Philip?

**Speaker B:** I mean, I'm doing some of these things already. I just work little hours. So, I just get by, but I can be satisfied with getting by. It's like, it's all right, I have a lot. It's just, it still sometimes annoys me when I have to go to work. But sometimes I have gladdened the mind and it's all right, nobody can annoy me.

**Speaker A:** That's the right way to do it. Congratulations. Yes, Maika and I disappeared at the same time. Because we're on the same router. After the power comes up, we still have to wait for the router to power up. So let's go ahead and finish this call. Does anybody have any last things to say?

**Speaker E:** I have something, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker E:** I hope this won't drag it on too far, but Westerners— you said when Westerners see Tibetan Buddhism, they're more likely to see Tibetan culture rather than Buddhism. Why do you think so many Westerners are attracted to Tibetan Buddhism over anything else, like any other tradition? Like, it's over tenfold.

**Speaker A:** Because it's a museum. It's a show. Tibetan culture is full of all kinds of things— mandalas and tathagatas and bells and prayer wheels and fancy temples and all kinds of stuff. That's why[No speech] And so yes, it's quite popular simply because it's so beautiful. Even though the Tibetans talk about Sunyata a lot, actually the Theravada is Sunyata. There's nothing there. People talk about Thai food, but that's Thai culture. But there's no thangkas, there's no mandalas, there's no prayer wheels, there's no bells. In fact, you probably know about this, that the bell that they ring at Wat Soi Nok is actually an old World War II ammunition that didn't go off. It's just an old piece of iron. Have you seen that, Bill?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, I've seen that. And they have another one here at the Intercontinental Center, the retreat center.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure what that is. Is it also— Yeah.

**Speaker E:** It'S also an old shell. Old shell from some bomb.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so when bombs come into your life, all you have to do is to turn it into a bell. And so this is the reason why Tibetan is, uh, let us say, popular in the West, because it's beautiful. Especially the Tonkas. Look how many different Tonkas they have, where Theravada is just about the mind and there's not much pictures to it. And in fact, the best drawing that you'll ever find is a pair of ears with nothing between them. Empty. Nothing to it. So does anybody else have anything? All right, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker I:** Yeah, thank you everyone for being here today. This is a splendid Sangha call. Always good to see smiling friends. Go ahead and check out the opensanghafoundation.org website again. We've been updating it, and Dhammarato in particular has changed how the menus work, so it's a lot easier to navigate now and get around the site. And there may be things that are on there that you haven't seen before. So do some exploring, go have fun with it. Also, we have an Open Sangha Foundation Facebook page and Instagram. So if you wanna follow those accounts, if you're on there, go ahead and give us a follow, share the content on there. These are some wholesome ways to participate in Sangha virtually.

**Speaker A:** Yes, a shout out to Cat. He's taking care of the Facebook.

**Speaker C:** And shout out to Aurelian for also participating a little bit. He's going to do some stuff for us too.

**Speaker B:** So thank you.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, during this school, I have a plan for the first post I'm going to do. I'm going to do— so I wrote it down. What is the Eightfold Noble Path like image stack? I'm gonna have like, you know how on Instagram you can have multiple images on one post? I'm gonna have like, probably like 8 or 10 images, just going through it.

**Speaker I:** That's the idea.

**Speaker A:** That's good to hear.

**Speaker I:** Okay, well everyone, it was good seeing you all.

**Speaker A:** Have a good moment. We have a lot of new posts. Gat's been putting posts and Alex has been putting posts up, so we've got a lot of new posts to share. Good stuff too.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Dhamma, that's some good stuff.

**Speaker A:** And also we've got a new message system just installed, checking it out, but it's much better than the message system that we've been using. In fact, it looks like that we might be able to get instant messaging in the sense like Skype, that you can have dialogues with people. Rather than having to refresh the screen to see the new dialogue, the new message, it'll just start showing up. This is what we're planning on, is to have a good dialogue system. So thank you all. Enjoy. Spend some time on the website. Message each other, join groups, post, blog, comment, do all of that kind of stuff. Let's get this thing rolling. We're the Buddhist Facebook.

**Speaker F:** Buddhist Facebook.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you guys. We'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, revolves around a central theme: **the importance of prioritizing one's own mental cultivation and finding contentment within, rather than getting entangled in the "bog" of societal expectations and the problems of others.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Metaphor: The Log in the Bog**
Dhammarato uses the Buddha's simile (from Sutta 36) of a waterlogged log to illustrate the main teaching:
*   A mind saturated with societal influences (stress, conflict, materialism, others' negativity) is like a wet log—it cannot catch the fire of enlightenment or true happiness.
*   One must first withdraw into **seclusion** (physical or mental) to "dry out"—to calm and gladden the mind through personal practice (like Anapanasati).
*   Returning to society prematurely, or without a "waterproof paint job" (strong, stable mindfulness and contentment), will cause the mind to become waterlogged again.

**Primary Advice: Save Yourself First**
*   **You are already okay:** The fundamental message, aligned with Zen insight, is that you don't need to be "saved." The problem is believing you are not okay. True practice is realizing and abiding in this inherent okay-ness.
*   **The Bodhisattva Vow Misinterpretation:** The discussion critiques a common Mahayana interpretation—that one must save all beings before attaining enlightenment. Dhammarato argues this is a fallacy that can prevent personal liberation. The effective path is to first secure your own peace (get in your own canoe and cross the flood), after which you can genuinely help others one-on-one.
*   **Avoid Spiritual "Swamps":** Actively avoid environments of conflict, negativity, and "ordinary people with ordinary problems" who will try to draw you into their dramas. The Buddha advised leaving areas of famine, disease, and conflict.

**Practical Application: Rethinking Work & Society**
*   **Challenge the "Need" for a Job:** A major provocative point is challenging the assumption that one must have a conventional job to survive. Using the monastics on the call as examples, Dhammarato suggests that much work is a societal trap that costs more (stress, time, expenses) than it provides.
*   **Simplify and Be Content:** Modern life encourages accumulation (clothes, possessions, money) far beyond necessity. True freedom comes from realizing you have enough, living simply, and finding contentment with the basics—like the alms food a monk receives.
*   **Gladden the Mind First:** The answer to the initial question ("how to gladden the mind with others") is to **gladden it beforehand** through solitary practice. A mind grounded in happiness and the present moment ("all I need is the next breath") becomes resilient and less susceptible to external annoyance.

**Cultural Context**
*   The talk distinguishes between **culture** (Thai, Tibetan, Japanese) and the **core Dhamma**. Westerners are often attracted to the exotic rituals and art of traditions like Tibetan Buddhism, while the essence—the simple, unadorned practice of mind-training—is found in all genuine paths.
*   The hierarchical, striving nature of Western society is contrasted with a more network-oriented, accept-your-place mindset found in some Asian cultures, which can be more conducive to realizing "you are already okay where you are."

**Conclusion**
The talk culminates in a shared sense of contentment among the participants. The ultimate teaching is to **stop believing the lies of insufficiency** propagated by society, to take full responsibility for your own mind, and to find the freedom and happiness that come from within, thereby becoming truly "waterproof" against the world's distractions and distress.

**In essence:** Don't try to drain the swamp of society. Instead, focus on getting your own log dry, building your own raft, and enjoying the peace of the other shore. From that place of stability, you can interact with the world without getting bogged down.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and stories to illustrate his points about spiritual practice, society, and the path to contentment. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The Log in the Bog (Swamp)**
This is the central, extended metaphor drawn from a Buddhist sutta (Sutta 36).
*   **The Bog/Swamp:** Represents ordinary society with its conflicts, pressures, and "unwholesome" influences.
*   **The Waterlogged Log:** Represents a person whose mind is saturated by societal conditioning, stress, and "bad ideas."
*   **Drying the Log:** Represents the necessity of **seclusion**—physically and mentally removing oneself from society to allow the mind to "dry out" and become capable of ignition (insight/happiness).
*   **Key Insight:** You can take the log (person) out of the bog (society), but it brings the bog with it (internalized habits and views). True practice requires sustained time away to "drip dry."

### 2. **The Waterproof Paint Job**
An extension of the log metaphor.
*   **The Paint Job:** Represents developing sufficient mental resilience and wisdom (*panna*) through practice so that when you must return to society, you are "insulated" or "waterproofed" against its negative influences. You don't get "bogged down" again.

### 3. **The Canoe (Hinayana) vs. The Cruise Liner (Mahayana)**
A metaphorical critique of different Buddhist approaches.
*   **The Canoe (Hinayana/Theravada):** Represents self-reliance. You build your own raft (practice), paddle yourself (do the work), and are responsible for your own journey to the "other shore" (liberation). It's agile and direct.
*   **The Big Boat / Cruise Liner (Mahayana):** Represents a passive, institutional approach. People stand in line, pay their dues (follow rituals), and expect the "boat" (the institution, saviors, Bodhisattvas) to carry them to enlightenment. The speaker argues this boat is overcrowded, directionless, and never arrives because no one is "rowing" (taking personal responsibility).

### 4. **The Bodhisattva Vow as an Absurd Argument**
A story-like critique of a common Mahayana ideal.
*   The speaker paints a humorous picture of enlightened Bodhisattvas standing outside "pearly gates" arguing, "You go next... No, *you* go," because their vow is to save all beings before themselves. He presents this as a **logical absurdity** that paradoxically leads to inaction, as saving everyone is impossible.

### 5. **Up to Your Hips in Alligators**
A common adage he references.
*   **The Swamp:** The world's problems and conflicts.
*   **The Alligators:** Immediate crises, arguments, and demands of daily life.
*   **Draining the Swamp:** The original noble intention (e.g., spiritual practice, helping others).
*   **The Moral:** When you're immersed in social chaos ("alligators"), you forget your true purpose. His **Buddhist twist** is that you *cannot* drain the world's swamp; the solution is to **get out of the swamp entirely** and stay out.

### 6. **The Raft**
A classic Buddhist simile (from the Alagaddupama Sutta) that he references.
*   The raft (Dhamma/practice) is used to cross the flood (suffering, *dukkha*) to the other shore (Nibbana). The key point is that upon arrival, you **leave the raft behind**. You don't cling to the teachings as dogma or an identity; you use them as a practical tool and then let go.

### 7. **Society as a Pyramid vs. a Network**
A cultural metaphor.
*   **Western Society as a Pyramid:** A stressful hierarchy where you climb by stepping on others or get pulled down by those below. It creates constant striving and insecurity.
*   **Thai/Asian Society as a Network:** A system where you have a place. The task isn't to climb, but to find contentment and happiness **right where you are**. This aligns with the Zen idea that "you are already okay."

### 8. **Spiritual Disease as a Contagion**
A medical metaphor.
*   Bad ideas, conflicts, and negative mental states are framed as the **"most communicable disease."** Being around people with "poisoned minds" is dangerous, like being in a plague zone. The prescription is to **quarantine yourself** (seek seclusion) to avoid infection.

### 9. **The $10 Million Price of Salvation**
A personal financial story.
*   The speaker frames his choice to remain a monk/live simply as having cost him $10 million in lost salary over 40 years. He calls this a **happy payment**, contrasting it with the spiritual "priceless gift" he received. This story reinforces the theme that worldly wealth and effort are often squandered on unnecessary things (clothes, cars, status), while true contentment is free but requires abandoning the chase for that wealth.

### 10. **Zen Master's Declaration: "You are already enlightened"**
A foundational Zen story/principle he endorses.
*   This contrasts with the "savior" complex of other traditions. The path is not about *becoming* okay, but **realizing you already are okay** and dropping the lies and activities (like compulsive working or arguing) that make you feel otherwise.

**In summary,** the speaker uses these metaphors and stories to advocate for a path of **personal responsibility, seclusion, and simplicity.** He criticizes institutional dependencies and societal pressures, urging individuals to "get their own canoe," "dry out" from societal influences, and realize the contentment that is already available to them.
