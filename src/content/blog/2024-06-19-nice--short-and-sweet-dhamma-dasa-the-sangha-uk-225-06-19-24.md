### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, I believe it started. Okay, gosh, it's so nice out even though it's super hot.

**Speaker B:** Super hot where you're at?

**Speaker A:** That's like 93 degrees or something.

**Speaker B:** It's hot enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, perfect. Perfection. Yeah, I used to have a lot more Dukkha when I would prefer certain temperatures over other temperatures, or other environments over some other environment. But when you learn to like all those things, then you can always be.

**Speaker B:** Happy.

**Speaker A:** Or be more happy than you otherwise would have been. Yeah, that's what I like about the Dharma. You can like find it in anything, you know. Yes. Even doing video chats and stuff, it's like I observe my mind going through certain things like, am I doing it right? Am I this? Is it going to go this way? Is it going to go that way? It's like, who cares, man? It's like, you know, if it lasts 5 minutes, it lasts 5 minutes. If it lasts a second, it lasts a second. The last 2 hours, the last 2 hours, who cares?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can appreciate that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And yeah, I remember Buddha Dasubhikkhu said it's kind of like a fun game, you know. He's like The mind will always.

**Speaker B:** Keep.

**Speaker A:** You, keep you busy in a manner of speaking. Because it likes to follow stuff, just like the water buffalo. He was saying like, we try to keep it on the path, but it likes to go through the vegetable gardens and stuff. Chomp on some of the food. Yeah, tries to eat all the food. That's okay, that's their nature anyways. Oh, have you got to catch any of Michael's lives at all?

**Speaker B:** I have not. I want to. Bhante Amar attending it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I heard he was going to be doing some, but I forgot the days though. I gotta check it out.

**Speaker B:** Me too. Is he ever on Discord?

**Speaker A:** I think, yeah, I think he was gonna do some lives on Discord.

**Speaker B:** That's cool. I'm still trying to figure out how to use that one best.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's— there's not much to it really. It depends on what you want to do, I guess. That's like a lot of social media. It's like, what does it really do?

**Speaker B:** Fills up time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, kills time, gives people some like attention, some dopamine rushes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if the dopamine rushes really were valuable, then it would just take a couple of them or one, then you'd be done with it, but you could keep going back. Keep going over there. It's funny how most things in life are just a big addiction, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it really is. Can be hard to come to terms.

**Speaker A:** With, but.

**Speaker B:** Certainly seems that way. We have all of these patterns that we build over time and just keep going and going and going and going.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and everything's just Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. So impermanence, dissatisfactory by nature, and inherently empty of a permanent self. So it's not worth grasping to anything.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Our looks will fade, our careers will fade if we even have any. All the material possessions, all the people we love, it'll all go. Comes in waves, you know. It's like breathing. Like they always say, the universe is like this cosmic breathing. And the only thing that can be considered permanent is the in permanent changing nature of it. It never ends, never seems to end.

**Speaker B:** Or begin. Everything that's born gets old, falls apart, and dies.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true. True, Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** That was the way I had the fourth tetrad of Anapanasati explained to me. Everything that's born gets old, falls apart, and dies, and then we have to let it go. We have to throw it away.

**Speaker A:** Whoa, cool. Yeah, there's this old Zen saying that I like. I heard it a few times from different sources, but it was like basically like We're born, we eat, we shit, we sleep, and we die. And I heard the woman explaining it on this video. She's like some Zen master chick. She was like, there's something comforting about that, even though it may at first glance seem like dark. And I'm like, yeah, there is something very comforting about that. It's like it's all bullshit. It's all gonna like just be washed away. Who gives a fuck?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if we can see that, it's probably easier to let it go. I'd say that's probably the part that we have the most trouble with. Holding on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Holding on to relationships, holding on to people and things. Holding on to, like you said, jobs.

**Speaker A:** Holding on to control.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that one's tough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, trying to control things. It's interesting because like, I don't know if you've ever read any Carl Jung at all.

**Speaker B:** No, not much. A little tiny bit. Tell me about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's a, he's an interesting dude. But he's saying like a lot of the things in society that are kind of popular show the real intentions of the unconscious. Like we all like these movies with violence and villains and anti-heroes like the Joker and superheroes and all this thing. After you observe it and contemplate it for a little while, it really is like such a a mirror into society or humanity's unconscious mind. It's like it's all just— they all just want power. They want to be the Joker. They want nobody telling them what to do. They want to be the superheroes with unlimited strength who are— they just want to control, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And Yeah, even in every aspect of life, it's like, why do you get this? Why do you go after this career? Why do you go after this goal? You want power. Kind of reminds me of Nietzsche, like life is a will to power, nothing besides. Yeah, it's interesting to think about. It is.

**Speaker B:** It's tough stuff.

**Speaker A:** But at the end of the day, we don't really need any answers or solutions or anything.

**Speaker B:** No, this is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is good enough. Mm-hmm. Satisfied.

**Speaker B:** If we had power, we'd be worried about losing it.

**Speaker A:** Yep. True that.

**Speaker B:** We're obsessed with what to do with it, how to change things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. That's why when we come back to the breath and in silence, it's just like there's no bullshit. It's like there's nothing that needs to be done. There's no perfect or imperfect. In a way, there's no existence nor non-existence. It's just, it is what it is. And it's nice. It is nice to be able to put down, let your workhorse rest for a while, drink some water. Graze on some grass in the beautiful windy field and just stop searching, stop constantly trying to get somewhere where we're not or get something that we don't have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Very nice.

**Speaker B:** It's very nice. Very pleasant.

**Speaker A:** Like this coffee. Never lets you down.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** So do you have anything you want to discuss at all, or anything that's been on your mind?

**Speaker B:** No, not really. I can't really think of anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, me neither.

**Speaker B:** Good stuff. Right on, man.

**Speaker A:** Well, Well, on that note, there's no reason to continue on.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, we've said the basics, basically. Look, change, don't worry, be happy. And anybody watching these videos, if you want more information, you can go to opensanghafoundation.org, I think it is.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you could message me or this dude. What was your name again, dude? Alex. Alex, nice dude. Well, nice to talk to you one-on-one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, nice to talk to you too, Dhammarato. Good to talk to you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nice, short and sweet.

**Speaker B:** Have a good one, friend.

**Speaker A:** You too, man. Appreciate it.

**Speaker B:** Yep, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B) is a relaxed, conversational exploration of core Buddhist insights applied to everyday life. Here is a summary of the key themes:

**Core Themes:**

1.  **Finding Contentment in All Conditions:** The talk opens with the idea that suffering (*Dukkha*) arises from preferences (e.g., for certain weather). True happiness comes from learning to be content with things as they are, finding the Dhamma in any situation.

2.  **Non-Attachment and Letting Go:** The speakers discuss the futility of worry and control, using the analogy of a video chat—it lasts as long as it lasts, and that's okay. This extends to a central teaching: everything is *Anicca* (impermanent), *Dukkha* (unsatisfactory), and *Anatta* (not-self). All things—looks, careers, possessions, relationships—arise and pass away. The spiritual task is to let them go, not to hold on.

3.  **The Addictive Nature of the Mind:** The conversation touches on how the mind, like a water buffalo straying from the path, constantly seeks engagement and "dopamine rushes" (e.g., from social media). Recognizing this pattern is key to understanding our attachments.

4.  **The Illusion of Control and Power:** They delve into the human desire for control and power, referencing Carl Jung and Nietzsche. The conclusion is that seeking power is endless and fraught; if you had it, you'd only worry about losing it.

5.  **The Peace of the Present Moment:** The ultimate refuge is returning to simple awareness, like watching the breath. In that space, there is no need to seek, control, or become anything. It is a restful state free from striving, compared to letting a workhorse rest in a peaceful field.

**Tone & Method:** The talk is informal and meandering, embodying the very attitude it discusses: relaxed, non-goal-oriented, and accepting of the conversation's natural flow. The wisdom is not delivered as a lecture but emerges through shared reflection on daily life.

**Conclusion:** The talk ends with the simple, distilled essence of the discussion: observe change, don't worry, be happy. It points listeners to the Open Sangha Foundation for further resources.

In essence, this talk is a practical demonstration of using Dhamma to release clinging, find ease in impermanence, and rest in the simplicity of the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors** and reference a few **stories** or analogies to illustrate their points about mindfulness, impermanence, and non-attachment. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1. **The Water Buffalo**  
   - **Context:** Speaker A recalls Buddha Dasubhikkhu comparing the mind to a water buffalo.  
   - **Meaning:** The mind naturally wanders off the path (of focus or mindfulness) and goes into "vegetable gardens" — distracting thoughts or desires — just as a water buffalo might stray to eat crops. It emphasizes acceptance of the mind's wandering nature without harsh judgment.

2. **Cosmic Breathing / The Universe Breathing**  
   - **Context:** Speaker A describes impermanence as being "like breathing."  
   - **Meaning:** The constant change of all phenomena is compared to the inhale and exhale of the universe — a continuous, rhythmic process of arising and passing away.

3. **The Workhorse Resting**  
   - **Context:** Speaker A talks about coming back to the breath and silence.  
   - **Meaning:** The striving, controlling mind is compared to a workhorse that needs to be allowed to rest, drink water, and graze — a metaphor for letting go of effort and ambition in meditation.

4. **Dopamine Rushes as Addictive but Empty**  
   - **Context:** Discussing social media and distractions.  
   - **Meaning:** The pursuit of pleasures (dopamine rushes) is compared to an addiction — something we keep returning to despite its lack of lasting value, highlighting its empty, repetitive nature.

5. **Life as a Wave**  
   - **Context:** Speaker A says everything "comes in waves."  
   - **Meaning:** Experiences, possessions, and relationships are transient, rising and falling like waves, emphasizing **anicca** (impermanence).

### **Stories / Analogies**

1. **The Zen Saying: "We're born, we eat, we shit, we sleep, and we die."**  
   - **Context:** Speaker A mentions a Zen master (a "Zen master chick") sharing this.  
   - **Purpose:** To strip life down to its bare, fundamental processes, illustrating the futility of overcomplication and the comfort in accepting life’s simple, inevitable cycle.

2. **Carl Jung's Analysis of Popular Culture**  
   - **Context:** Speaker A references Carl Jung’s idea that movies (e.g., superheroes, the Joker) reflect society’s unconscious desires.  
   - **Purpose:** Used as an analogy to show how the craving for power and control manifests in cultural stories, mirroring our own inner drives.

3. **Nietzsche's "Will to Power"**  
   - **Context:** Brought up alongside the Jung discussion.  
   - **Purpose:** Serves as a philosophical story/metaphor for the underlying motivation behind many human pursuits — the desire for power, which ultimately leads to **dukkha** (suffering).

4. **The Fourth Tetrad of Anapanasati**  
   - **Context:** Speaker B explains it as "Everything that's born gets old, falls apart, and dies, and then we have to let it go."  
   - **Purpose:** This is a framework (a story of process) from mindfulness of breathing meditation, used to describe the inevitable arc of all conditioned things.

### **Overall Themes Illustrated**
These metaphors and stories collectively reinforce core Buddhist/Dharma ideas:
- **Impermanence (Anicca)** – waves, breathing, the Zen saying.
- **Non-attachment & Letting Go** – the water buffalo, the workhorse resting, throwing away what dies.
- **The Empty Nature of Craving** – dopamine addiction, the "will to power" in cultural stories.
- **Finding Peace in Acceptance** – finding comfort in life’s simple, unavoidable nature.

The conversation uses everyday, relatable imagery to make abstract spiritual concepts tangible and memorable.
