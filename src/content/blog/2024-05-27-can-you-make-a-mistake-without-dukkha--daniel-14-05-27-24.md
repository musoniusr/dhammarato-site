### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Seconds and then it would quit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So back to what we were talking about, that, um, Ajahn Sati is a really, really good teacher because he does nothing. He teaches nothing, right? That what we think is screw-ups Wrong actions, late for chanting, make mistakes, and all of that in Western culture is all considered bad. And that we're taught to feel bad when we make mistakes. And in the disposition of the Buddha, no such thing as a mistake. The only thing is Dukkha. Can you make a mistake without Dukkha? If you can make a mistake without Dukkha, then it's not a mistake. It's a learning opportunity. And in fact, possibly the only mistakes we ever make in reality is Dukkha. And the only reason that I'd say that that's a mistake is because we don't like it. That's what it means, is being dissatisfied. That's the mistake that we make, and we'll use any opportunity like screw-ups, late for chanting, any of that kind of stuff, we'll use as an opportunity to actually screw up, which is to feel bad. And that's a hard concept to get across to folks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it really is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the only screw-up is to feel bad about our screw-ups.

**Speaker B:** Even when I can see it, sometimes it feels a bit hard to change. For example, this morning I thought I slept too long, like I took a nap after breakfast, after pindapath, and I slept for like 3 hours. And then, yeah, I can see like how ingrained that thought is into me, like sleeping and doing nothing is a bad thing. You've got to be meditating.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, the time to meditate is when we're thinking thoughts about feeling bad about sleeping. That's the time to meditate upon. Look at me, I feel bad because I was sleeping rather than meditating. And right now I have an opportunity to meditate and I'm not doing it.

**Speaker B:** That does bring up a point that the Buddha said, and this is a quote from the Deepabhavana chanting book, that you should only lie down to rest and, yeah, not to enjoy like lying down. Do you have any comments on that?

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's how most people do it. In fact, many people in our society lay down to rest and don't rest. And there is a sutra, I forget the name of it, in the Majjhima Nikaya, where the Buddha and Ananda have gone to a group of laypeople, and the laypeople are asking the Buddha questions, and his back is hurting. And so he said to Ananda, my back is hurting, I'm going to lay down to rest. You take over. Okay, and so when Ananda took over and talked about basically Four Jhanas, which was— good thing Bhikkhuni found better things to talk about to these lay people. But the point that we're making here is that, yeah, there's often opportunities to lay down, to rest. If the Buddha's back didn't hurt, if he wasn't in the position of needing to rest his back, then of course he would have been up talking, because he enjoys that. But Westerners, when they hear that, that the Buddha says that laying down is laying down to rest, that you're not supposed to enjoy it, They'll take that as some kind of rule: thou shalt not lay down. I've seen that happen a lot. I mean, people will sit up all night meditating rather than taking the time they need to rest.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so if you're resting, just rest. Enjoy the rest, not the laying down.

**Speaker B:** Ah, so it's not really the action itself, it's more about are you paying attention to really resting your body and your mind, or are you enjoying? Well, I don't see how you can enjoy it any other way. I mean, that's the only way to enjoy it, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Then in fact, let us say that people who are in a state of depression, a mental state of depression, will often spend a whole lot more time in bed laying down than people who are not depressed. Thinking that, why bother? I might as well just lay down and enjoy laying down. Where in fact, the enjoying laying down doesn't have any real value, because they're still having a whole lot of thoughts about poor me. That in fact, when you talk about depression, the easiest way to look at it is that people are depressing their joy. That's what depression is all about. How dare you enjoy yourself? You're supposed to be misery to the point of needing a doctor, medication, and maybe getting locked up. And in fact, they use the word clinical depression And in a way, there's no such thing. It doesn't exist. What does exist is people enjoying feeling bad. Enjoying, yeah, in quotations, in great big quotations. So anyway, back to your practice there at The Wat Inroyat. I'm really glad to hear that you've decided that it's of more value than you thought when you went there originally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I got a lot more than I came for.

**Speaker A:** You can believe that there are actually quite a lot of very good Watts in Thailand. Yeah, because there are a lot of Arahant Santi, especially because, uh, uh, in the early days, uh, '60s, '70s, '80s, and starting into the '90s, there was a whole lot of monks at Wat Soan Mok.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then after he died and they got their Theravada 20 years in, they were, let us say, prime merchandise for Watts looking for an abbot. So most of the students who became Theravadas at Watson and Moe wound up going all over the country, becoming abbots at one wat or another. Now you say that Ajahn Santi actually isn't the abbot of the wat that he's at. Do you know whether or not the abbot that is there, is he also a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa? More than likely the answer would be, of course.

**Speaker B:** I don't think I said that. I think maybe you're mistaken with someone else.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so Ajahn Santi is the abbot of the wat? That's what I had thought originally, and I thought that I'd heard from you that he wasn't the abbot. Maybe it was something that Kat had said.

**Speaker B:** No, yeah, he is the abbot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, but Achan Santi, I knew about him. I hadn't met him. I never have met him, but I've always had reputations from him. He was— how old is he now?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I'm not sure. He has about 27 years as a monk, so maybe he was like Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So he ordained slightly after Ajahn Bhikkhu Buddhadasa died then.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right. Yeah, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa died in 1993, is that right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So he ordained in 1996.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, something like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, he didn't need Bhikkhu Buddhadasa to hear Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's for sure. Yeah, actually, his— I was just thinking his preceptor is from an Anagami cha wat, but that doesn't mean that he necessarily stayed there all the time, of course. So I'm not sure where he was trained.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you do know that Ajahn Chah was a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you said he visited quite often to Wat Suamok.

**Speaker A:** That he, Ajahn Chah, would bring his students to Wat Suamok. That in fact, you know, probably that Udon Thant— excuse me, Udon Ratchasima and Roy Ett are fairly close. They're close up in that area of Thailand.

**Speaker B:** I never heard of Udon Ratchasani. Do you mean Ubon Ratchathani?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Ubon Ratchathani.

**Speaker B:** That's actually on the other side. That's like all the way in east, the east of Thailand.

**Speaker A:** Well, Royette is kind of in the middle. I mean, they're not that far away from each other.

**Speaker B:** Ah, I thought you were talking about Suvarnabhuk and Ubon Ratchathani.

**Speaker A:** No, no, I'm talking about Royette, that they're quite close together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there may be an— so what, uh, Panna, Anicca is where Very.

**Speaker B:** Close to me, it's about 2 hours away.

**Speaker A:** And where by name? Ubon Ratchathani.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So Udon Ratchasima, I don't know where that is. I might have made that up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it seems to be a mix of a few different places.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So I actually also had some questions about practice. Shall I give those a go?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So I wrote them down. And yeah, what I've noticed noticed is that, yeah, you mentioned that sometimes the wholesome thoughts and the feelings are very close together when you get really strong discernment. Like you have wholesome thoughts and instantly you get the positive feelings, right? But sometimes the feelings take a bit longer to change. So wanting to change the feeling can be— sorry, someone tried to call me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back.

**Speaker B:** So sometimes wanting to change the feelings is wise wanting because you can do it like right away. With a wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** But sometimes it's not wise wanting because, yeah, it takes a little while to change the Vedana.

**Speaker A:** The better that you get at it, the more skilled you are, the more training that you have will allow you in that gap to, number one, shorten the gap, and number two, be okay with the gap, that in fact the attitude does drive the feelings and the feelings will drive the attitude. Let us say that the feelings drive the attitude for more ignorant people, and the wise, their attitude will drive their feelings. But in both cases, they condition one another. That in fact, in the Anapanasati Sutra, it talks about it in the Vedana section.

**Speaker B:** Do you have one second? There's someone at my door. I'll be right back.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Oh, sorry.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'm back.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so as I was about to say, in the Vedana section of the Anapanasati Sutta, it talks about mental conditioners, that feelings condition the mind. And when we begin to see that, then we can kind of turn it around so that the mind or our attitude begins to condition the feelings because they're interrelated. Now, in the case that you're talking about, you have the right mental attitude, but then the feelings are not there, and so now the feelings affect the attitude. Oh, poor me, I can't feel as happy as I want to say I am.

**Speaker B:** Arahant. Yeah, that's what I'm getting at. But I realized that yesterday, and then I saw like the significance of sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Sometimes the feelings are just not there at the moment. And you just got to change your feeling about that feeling, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, that's okay, so that you remain the good attitude and the feelings will follow. But if you let your feelings lead, they will lead you back into an unwholesome attitude. So let the attitude control the feelings rather than letting the feelings control the attitude. This is very subtle. I'm really glad that you're mentioning this, talking about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this— I'm— yeah, it's okay. Can you talk more about it? That's really interesting.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's not a whole lot to say. There's— in fact, I don't have very many analogies of it because almost always this is the realization that we have is that the beginning student in fact will say, "Brightening the mind, gladdening the mind, no place to go, nothing to do, but I still feel bad." Right? "But I still feel bad" means that now the feelings are more important to them than the attitude. They want to fix the feelings, but they want to fix the feelings. Yeah, that's right, that's the Dukkha. Exactly. And wanting something you don't have is the Dukkha. But as you progress into the middle of the path, then in the middle you have the right attitude, and when the feelings are not there, we can say, "Aha, I see that," and that's okay. And then we begin to feel better immediately because our attitude doesn't change into the unwholesome and go along with the feelings, but in fact the feelings begin now to go along with the attitude. But that takes a sharp wit. You got to really see what's going on. You got to really see that, and then you have a choice. This is in fact part of the reason why Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about why it's so important to practice correctly when we're sick, because when the body is ill, we automatically have, let us say, negative feelings, wanting to feel better, not liking being sick. But the correct practice would be, all right, the body is sick, the feelings are sick, but the attitude is, we can handle that sickness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you got to be a champion.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we could be a champion, we'd be a sick champion, but we're still a champion. And with that, then the feelings will begin to go along then with the attitude that it's okay. It's okay to be sick. Let me rest. And then the psychosomatic stuff really starts into play. This is what the doctor— the doctors have known about psychosomatic illnesses and problems and all of that, but they don't really recognize that the psychosomatic work in two ways. One is that when we're sick with a bad attitude, we're sicker. And when we're sick with a good attitude, we're not so sick. And in fact, we'll get better quicker when we have that champion's attitude, that I can handle being sick. And a lot of people, when they get sick, they'll just wallow in it. Oh, poor me. And then the poor me lasts longer than the sickness. In fact, some people get to the point that they don't even like the fact that the body feels better because they got used to feeling so bad in the first place. So they'll just stay sick in the body because their feelings and their attitude is sick.

**Speaker B:** It's like you would rather fall from the first first floor, then from the fifth floor. So you're just going to stay down.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so they kind of stay down. But the other way around is, is that when a noble gets sick, that's okay. And so then the feelings are okay. Because the attitude is okay, and pretty soon then the body will be okay. It's almost like our attitude— you see, everything is a chemical. Our attitude is a chemical in the mind, and then our feelings are chemicals that are in the base part of the mind that's going down into the brainstem, and then the body is a bunch of chemicals from the brainstem down. And it's all a matter of the chemistry within the mind. So which one is going to affect which? Are you going to let the body control the reptilian brain, which is going to control the frontal cortex? Are you going to let the frontal cortex manage the way that we feel in the sense of the actual emotions, the feelings, the liking and not liking, which is part of the reptilian brain? Which then is going to be affecting the body.

**Speaker B:** So you would say that the prefrontal cortex is the most skillful or the strongest way to affect?

**Speaker A:** And it's the most human. This is the point about the frontal cortex, is that only humans have it. That's the higher mind. The Manu in the Pali, as opposed to the Citta, which is the rear part of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Ah, I never realized that the Citta is like the alligator.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right, it's the alligator mind. It's the reptilian mind. It's the mind that feels. And those feelings then are actually— the feelings control the attitude for ignorant people, but for the wise, the attitude controls the feelings.

**Speaker B:** So with the gladdening of the mind, with the right attitude, we're trying to control our attitudes about the body about the mind, about our perceptions, and all phenomena. So basically—.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay, so here's a way of thinking about it, is that the body is sick, and then the kind of thoughts that we can have is, "Oh, well, it's maybe a bacterial infection. Bacterial infections exist, people get sick." 'People have been getting sick all over town, people have been getting sick for centuries. Sickness exists.' That's the wise way of looking at it, that sickness exists, let's make the best of it. It's real, it's part of reality. But the ordinary mind is, 'I'm sick, I don't like it.' I can't do anything about it. I need a doctor. Oh, poor me. And so then the body sick controls the feelings, and then the feelings control the mind. And so now the body is sick, the reptilian mind is sick, and the frontal cortex is sick. But if you've got an ounce of nobility We can change that attitude in the frontal cortex from everything's okay, sickness exists, so what, it's a day off.

**Speaker B:** As a kid, I loved being sick. I could stay in bed all day and play video games.

**Speaker A:** Or the other side of it was that this is how I was raised with my dad. That I would be sick, and he says, "You're not sick! Get up and go to school!" And so I got sick, I got up, and I went to school, and basically ignored the sickness. And because of that, I have not been sick much in my life. That in fact, having a cold, having sniffles, having a stuffed-up nose, not being able to breathe, having a temperature and all of that kind of stuff, I don't consider sick, because my dad considered it not sick enough to be sick.

**Speaker B:** Just trivial stuff.

**Speaker A:** So it has to do, you can see then, about the attitude that people who don't get sick much in their life is because of the attitude that they have, to where other people are sick a lot, they'll wind up with all kinds of weird, let us call it, labels that the doctors will put on them. But it all has a matter to do with attitude, okay? Even things like leukemia is an attitude. Things like cancer, that's an attitude.

**Speaker B:** Uh, in what sense?

**Speaker A:** All right, the answer— the point about cancer is, is that people are eating away at themselves. Ah, right. Yeah. Okay, how about a heart attack? What does that mean? It means you're— are you attacking the heart, or is it attacking you? And what is the heart? Is it the pumper, or is it the, uh, the heart, or the actual reptilian brain? Where is the thrombosis? Why do arteries get clogged up? Well, a lot of it has to do with diet, but isn't our diet completely controlled by our attitude?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure, right? I like sweet stuff, so I'm going to be eating a whole lot of sweets, clogging up the arteries, getting sick. Yeah, but with the knowledge of that, then we can avoid sweets. We can see that the sweets are dangerous, they're not delicious, they're dangerous. That's an attitude change.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So really, healthy living is a healthy attitude.

**Speaker B:** But at the same time, you often say like, yeah, don't care about the sweets, just eat whatever's on your plate, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, if the attitude— let us talk about it in the sense of the monk. And here's the question: do you actually eat out of the bowl, or do you eat off a plate? You— what do you do, dump the stuff? Do you go for pindapat, or do they cook it to what?

**Speaker B:** Uh, pindapat.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you take the stuff out of the bowl and put on a plate. Do you carry the plate on pindapat? No. No. Okay, so why go through the extra step of taking the food out of the bowl and putting it on a plate?

**Speaker B:** Well, first we gather everything on the plates and then it gets like evenly distributed to all the monks.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's part of what Ajahn Chah would do at Wat Soen Mokkh. What we got put in our bowl, that's what we got, that's what we ate. Now that's also possibly true because of the lack of it. Here's when I was at Wat Tulapatthan and we'd go out on Venerable Bhante. I'd have to take the bag, you know, the alms bag, the kapow. You have to take that with you because you don't have enough room in the bowl. And that you can actually fill that kapow up and have more stuff in the kapow than in the bowl. So at Wat Tulapatthan, we would go back and start throwing stuff in great big washtubs because the amount of food that you would get would be 5 times the amount that you could actually eat. Now, there was actually an interesting tradition because all of that extra food that at Wat Chulapaton had a destination, because right next door basically was a grade school. And so it became that the parents wouldn't feed the kids at home, they'd give all the food to the monks. And then the monks, that the stuff that they couldn't eat, would give to the to the school, and the kids would eat at school. They didn't need to have school lunch programs. The school lunch program was the wat. And so, yeah, because we have plates, in the time of the Buddha, they didn't have plates. And in fact, the way that the monks lived is that if you can't carry it with you, there's no reason to have it. And so that's why I asked you, do you take the plate with you out on Venerable Bhante? The answer is no, but you could eat out of the bowl. But I guess it has to do with the, with the wat and the way things are. There's no big difference between the two of them. But the point that I'm making is, is that When there's not a whole lot, you eat what's in the bowl. You eat what you're given. And Bhikkhuni reminded me several times that monks eat like lions. The day we make a kill, we fill right up like the lion does. But when that carcass gets stinky and old, We'd rather not eat it.

**Speaker B:** You eat like you're in prison, right? Like you lean over.

**Speaker A:** Actually, no. In prison, they do the same routine over and over again. What I'm talking about with monks eating like a lion is sometimes you go out on vendabat and there's not much there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so you don't eat much that day. And then other days, like a Buddha day, the people come to the wat and they give all kinds of extra groceries and the monks fill fill up on those days because there's a lot of food, but on other days there's not much food. So like lions will eat once a week and they will really stuff themselves, and then they'll lay around doing nothing for 3 or 4 days, not getting hungry. And then they'll spend another couple of days getting a little bit hungry and thinking about going hunting again. And then eventually they'll get up after 3 days or 4 days. And then so once a week they eat a huge amount, and then for the rest of the time not so much. Now, in City Watch, that's not true because people at Bendabout will be out there every morning giving stuff. So the point here would be then is that what you eat, you have sometimes a whole lot of choice about, and sometimes you don't have much choice. About what you eat. But what you eat has more to do with your attitude than what you eat. Oh, this is not enough. Oh, I'm starving. Oh, I can't get enough, Bill, and all of that. And then the monk is going to be miserable. So Ajahn Po, he was really, really wise when he would tell me that monks eat like lions. Sometimes you have a full plate, sometimes nothing to eat. Learn to be happy with what you've got. And that I would say that monks in general are fairly more healthy than lay people in general. Now they do give some treats, they do give some food, they do give some but not like they have in the West. Not like big cakes, ice cream, potato chips, what they call junk food. You don't find much junk food in your bowl. Some, but not much. And it's that junk food then that people get addicted to because of the taste of it. And so they wind up eating a whole lot of it simply because they like the taste.

**Speaker B:** When I get that stuff in my bowl, I was always like, should I eat it? Should I not eat it? And then I realized I was just getting in Dukkha over it over and over again. And now when I get it, the first thing I do when we start eating is I give it to Katal. So I don't have to worry about it anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't have to worry about it. In fact, your attitude about eating is more important than the actual eating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But that's true on everything. Your attitude is the supreme point, and there are— and for almost all people, the attitude is controlled by the feelings. But for us, in our practice, we learn to have the right attitude and then teach the attitude to control the penis.

**Speaker B:** And the right attitude is basically like just changing the perceptions, right?

**Speaker A:** That's right, changing the perception. Will change the attitude. Yeah, in a way you could say that the salayatana is actually the attitude. That's the contact, the attitude that contacts to make the feelings the way that they are, rather than having the feelings then control the perception that winds up having an attitude that is controlled by the feelings. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Recognize that you can have a— you can brighten the mind, you can gladden the mind, you can change from that victimhood that we've been taught, that we've been taught for our whole lives. Change it into the winner's attitude. And then when you're sick, oh, I'm sick, I can handle that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually, yeah, just another point popped up in my mind about the right attitude, and that is like, yeah, you often say like sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. So I get the significance of that now. But something like, I started applying, yeah, the same thing to other hindrances. Like, for example, tiredness. Like, sometimes I feel tired and I can do deep breathing, I can walk, I can lay down, but still I keep being tired. And then I realized, yeah, what if I just stop seeing the tiredness as a problem, even though it's a hindrance? And yeah, you often talk about laziness, that that's like okay to have as long as you're alert. So is being tired but alert something good?

**Speaker A:** There's an interesting thing about that. People who are actually lazy don't get tired often. And people who are not lazy work too hard and get tired.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so from that context, being lazy means that you don't get so tired. But you do get tired, and when you are tired, you can see the tired and see the tiredness. Basically, there's two kinds of tiredness, and one of them, let us say in the sense of alligator wrestling, or in the case of a mongoose versus a cobra, that the mongoose will wear out the cobra, or an alligator wrestler will wear out the alligator. Why is that? It's because though the snake and the alligator, because they're cold-blooded, they do not have any stamina, that they get tired really, really quickly. Now, really what we mean in this case of being tired is, is that when the muscles are pumping, whether they're reptilian or whether they're human, when muscles are pumping, they burn energy, which means a chemical reaction and a change. And almost always the byproduct of that chemical change is an acid. And so as the muscles fill up with acid, it takes a while for the blood to circulate, to take that crap, the acids that are in the muscles, circulated around to put it through the liver and the kidneys to process, to get that acid out. Okay, now there's another point. This is really interesting. About the human anatomy and the chemistry is that those very acids then are stored in the liver and in the kidneys, so that when you have fear, when you have that fight-or-flight syndrome, that means then that the adrenaline gland, which is sitting right there with the kidneys and the liver, are going to then pull new acids out and create a new product called adrenaline and cortisol which are then used for the energy that actually have those acids in them. But when you then expend that energy, it breaks down into amino acids again. Okay, but when the acids are being pumped into the blood, you pump a lot of oxygen in there with it so that the— so that the, uh, the adrenaline chemicals and the oxygens will burn up, causing a lot of carbon dioxide, create a little bit of water, and break back down into acid. So when you get tired, that means then that there is a lot of acidic— there's a lot of acid in the body. So that means then that one of the things that we could do is we could start to breathe better. Which then will throw a lot of that acid, which by the way is called carbonic acid, which is nothing but carbon dioxide mixed with water. Carbon dioxide actually then is an acid that we can breathe out. This is why when you breathe well, you don't get so tired. But oftentimes when people are struggling, they hold their breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they get short breath.

**Speaker A:** They have a short— well, not a pumping hard breath like, like that. Well, they do that simply because that's a natural reaction from the brain that says you've got way too much carbon dioxide in your system. But we can actually intentionally with the frontal cortex breathe that way which means that we will go into what we call hyperventilation, which means that now we've got way too much oxygen and very little carbon dioxide. It's kind of a high. But when we do that breathing, let us call it naturally, because we're tired, that means that we already have too much carbon dioxide and all those other amino acids and things that are still in the body. So what then does tiredness mean? We basically see that there's two kinds of tiredness. One is that we were exerting, and the other one is that we're not breathing. So when people get tired and sleepy in church, it's because they're not breathing. I mean, they're just sitting in church. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or in case of Donald Trump sitting in court and he's sleeping. He didn't get tired because he was out pumping iron. He got tired because he had shut down.

**Speaker B:** When was this?

**Speaker A:** Oh, you don't watch the news at all, huh?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** For the past 5 weeks, for the past 5 weeks, the news has been filled with Donald Trump is sleeping through his court case. Ah, I see. He goes to sleep every day. And the reason is, is that he's not breathing well, and his lawyers don't know what the issue is, and so they give him things to read. Guess what? For many people, reading at night, getting sleepy and tired and going to sleep, is because when we're reading, our brain is active but we're not breathing well.

**Speaker B:** So you use more energy, but you're not breathing.

**Speaker A:** So we're using more energy, but still not changing the way that we breathe. All right. So if you know that, then you've probably also seen that, that when you're sitting in meditation and you get tired, the right thing to do is to start breathing. Another thing to do is to get up and move around, because if you get up and move around, guess what? You start breathing. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, even with deep breathing, sometimes you just get tired.

**Speaker A:** Yes, even so with deep breathing, you still can exert so that you do get tired.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's especially like if I had a lot of Dukkha, so to say, like a day where I have a lot of anxious thoughts, then yeah, you can really feel that like by the end of the day you kind of feel like burned up and just like really, really tired.

**Speaker A:** All right, so here's something also that a lot of people don't know, but it's very scientifically true and that we can start off with. In the wintertime, most of the heat loss happens through the head. This is why it's so important if you're in cold weather to wear a hat. All right, so now that we know that, we can also put two and two together to recognize that it's the brain that uses most of the energy. You see, if the brain wasn't using all the energy out in the cold weather, then it would be the body And so all the blood is in the body, the mind's not doing much, and so your body is full of clothing already, you're not going to get cold. But the fact is, is that most of the energy that we expend in our society is expended through thought. Thinking takes a lot of energy. So this— and guess what? When you feel tired, you don't feel tired like an aching muscle. You feel tired, like the mind's not working anymore.

**Speaker B:** Right? Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And the reason for it is, is because you've already expended all of that oxygen that was in the blood, and we're still not breathing well. And so we, we get tired and sleepy and go to sleep because we're not getting enough oxygen. Yeah. Okay, so seeing how deeply related that is means that this is why the Buddha was so into Anapanasati, to keep breathing, because you need that air, you need that breathing in order to keep the mind sharp and bright rather than dull and tired.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Thank you for that, that's really helpful. I have one last point maybe we could discuss, because I heard someone else calling, so I won't hold you up for too long.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** So there's one last thing. So about why is one thing? So there's a couple of things that I'm not sure if they are wholesome or not. The first one is sometimes like my kuti is really, really quiet because it's got windows and so there's like basically no sounds. And sometimes I put on like nature sounds just to like stimulate my mind a bit. Would you see this as like unwholesome?

**Speaker A:** Well, the nature sounds at Wat Soan Mokkh, they have more concrete kutis nowadays, but in the old days they were all made out of teak wood. You've been to my house here, so the kind of kutis that you'll find at Wat Soan Mokkh are this kind of wood, which means that you do hear a lot of nature sounds. They're nature. Yeah, but when you have concrete walls, the concrete itself will dull and deaden that, so that if you go outside, you can hear a whole lot more activity.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what I would suggest then, instead of turning the artificial tape on for the nature sounds, is to go take a hike. This is time for walking meditation.

**Speaker B:** But so it's really hot outside.

**Speaker A:** You get used to that. I mean, yeah, you from Northern Europe Yeah, it's hot. Can you recognize, yeah, it's hot, but I can handle that? Yeah, it's hot, but you can handle it. Then in fact, it's hot only because you notice the huge temperature change. I assume that what you're saying is, is that you've got aircon.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I'll tell you a little secret, and that is that finally I gave in to Piti and Tam's point because it really did get hot. And so we bought an air conditioner, 9,000 baht plus 2,000 to have it installed. And so my position is more Thai, is to turn it off. Thai people in general don't like aircon. So here's the point now. When I leave the bedroom, the door is shut, aircon. I open that door and walk into the front room. It's hot. I recognize that it's hot. Why? Because it's a change of temperature, sometimes 10 or 15 degrees depending upon whether you're Celsius or Fahrenheit, but it's hot. That it'll go from 26 in the room to 32, 36 degrees outside. And I think this is hot, but I come out on the porch and after a couple of minutes I'm not thinking about it hot. I don't think about it being hot right now, but I'm not in the aircon. I could go into the aircon, as soon as I go in I'll say, wow, this is so much cooler. But after I stay in the aircon for an hour or two, it's not cooler, it's just ordinary, or sometimes it feels cold. It's not in the correct temperature range. So that's the way to think about it, is when you say, yeah, but it's hot outside, the answer to that is only hot for 10 seconds, and then you get used to it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I spent about 2 hours outside this morning just walking with the dogs and doing walking meditation.

**Speaker A:** And it wasn't hot until you went back into the aircon and then it's cold again.

**Speaker B:** Before that even, I was still outside and I was like, oh, it's so humid today. I'm like covered in sweat and whatnot and it's hot.

**Speaker A:** But, uh, but it does have a lot to do with attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, for sure, that's true.

**Speaker A:** That— and so people who were raised in a hot climate are used to it and they have the attitude that it's okay. People who were raised in the northern climates get used to lower temperatures, and so they don't like it when the temperatures are higher. But the fact is, is that humans could get along anywhere from, uh, let us say 18 degrees all the way up to 34, 35 degrees. That's a huge range of temperature, but we don't like what we're not used to.

**Speaker B:** So basically what you're saying is go practice gladdening the minds.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go practice gladdening the mind when the temperature is 5 or 10 degrees higher than it is in the aircon room. Yeah, because I'm not going to be able, nor do I want to, try to air condition this porch. I love the nature. I'd rather be in nature with a little bit higher temperature than being in the bedroom closed off with the aircon on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it makes sense.

**Speaker A:** So go give it a try. Yeah, every time that you want to have some nature sounds, go to nature.

**Speaker B:** Fair enough. But yeah, things like that. Do you see it as like sensual pleasures, or?

**Speaker A:** Well, it depends upon what we're used to. And remember that there is nothing wrong. You see, it has to do with our language, that sensual pleasure and sensual desire are two completely different things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that the Buddha was into being against sensual desire, which means going to the brothel, going and getting drunk, going and gambling, going shopping— that kind of sensuality— as opposed to— yeah, the big ones— as opposed to just being in nature and taking in nature's reality.

**Speaker B:** And playing with the dogs, for example?

**Speaker A:** Playing with dogs is quite natural because the dogs actually hung around. There were dogs around the Buddha his whole time that he was teaching. But in fact, you were asking about the Sutta Nipata. There are stories about the dogs in the Sutta Nipata. I'm surprised that there's no dogs in the Mahayana.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, they're good Dharma teachers.

**Speaker A:** They're good Dharma teachers. All right, well, let's finish this off and I'll go talk to Dean.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you so much. This was really a great call.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I enjoyed.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching revolves around **the primacy of attitude over external conditions and the redefinition of "mistakes."**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Only Real Mistake is Dukkha (Suffering/Dissatisfaction):**
*   The talk challenges the Western cultural notion of mistakes (being late, making errors) as inherently "bad."
*   The Buddha's disposition sees no inherent mistake in actions; the only true "mistake" is generating *dukkha*—feeling bad, guilty, or dissatisfied.
*   A "screw-up" only becomes one when we add suffering to it. Without *dukkha*, it's merely a learning opportunity. **"The only screw-up is to feel bad about our screw-ups."**

**2. Attitude is Supreme: The Mind Leads the Feelings:**
*   A major theme is the relationship between **attitude (mind/mental perception)** and **feelings (*vedana*)**.
*   For the unwise, feelings control the attitude (e.g., feeling sick leads to a "poor me" attitude).
*   For the wise, a cultivated right attitude controls and transforms the feelings (e.g., accepting sickness with a "champion's" attitude of "I can handle this").
*   This is a skill developed through practice. The goal is to shorten the gap between a wholesome thought and the corresponding positive feeling, and to be okay with that gap.

**3. Practical Applications of the Right Attitude:**
*   **Regarding Rest:** The Buddha's instruction to "lie down only to rest" is about intention, not a rigid prohibition. The problem is not resting, but lying down in a state of depression or avoidance ("enjoying feeling bad"). If the body needs rest, rest fully and without guilt.
*   **Regarding Sickness:** A "champion's attitude" toward illness—accepting it as a natural part of reality—can actually improve psychosomatic well-being and recovery, versus "wallowing" in it.
*   **Regarding Food:** What you eat is less important than *your attitude toward eating*. Monks learn to be happy with whatever is offered, avoiding the *dukkha* of craving or aversion (e.g., worrying about "junk food" in the alms bowl).
*   **Regarding Tiredness:** Often stems from poor breathing (especially during intense thinking or stress) rather than pure physical exertion. The solution is mindful breathing (*ānāpānasati*) or movement to oxygenate the body and brighten the mind.
*   **Regarding Discomfort (e.g., Heat):** Discomfort is often a matter of perception and habituation. The practice is to apply "gladdening the mind" to conditions like heat, recognizing that the initial shock passes and we can adapt.

**4. The Physiology of Practice:**
*   The talk uses a model where the **prefrontal cortex** (the wise, human, "attitude" center) can be trained to manage the **reptilian brain/limbic system** (the "alligator mind" that generates raw feelings).
*   Wholesome perceptions and attitudes create a "chemistry" that affects emotions and even physical health.

**Overall Essence:** The Dhamma talk emphasizes that the path is about **cultivating a resilient and wholesome inner attitude** that meets all of life's experiences—errors, rest, sickness, food, fatigue, and environmental discomfort—without creating unnecessary *dukkha*. The practice is to let this wise attitude lead, thereby transforming our relationship to feelings and external conditions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about Buddhist practice, attitude, and the nature of suffering (Dukkha). Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The "Screw-up" as a Learning Opportunity:** The primary metaphor reframes a "mistake" or "screw-up." It's not the action itself that's the error, but the **Dukkha (suffering, dissatisfaction)** we add to it. The only real "mistake" is feeling bad about our actions. This turns the conventional view of error on its head.
2.  **The Frontal Cortex vs. The Reptilian Brain (Alligator Mind):** Speaker A uses a neuroscientific metaphor to explain the dynamic between wise discernment and primal feeling.
    *   **Frontal Cortex:** Represents the higher, human mind (*mano*), capable of wise attitude and intention.
    *   **Reptilian Brain/Alligator Mind:** Represents the base mind (*citta*), the seat of raw feelings and instincts.
    *   The key teaching is that for the ignorant, **feelings control the attitude** (reptilian brain drives the frontal cortex). For the wise, **attitude controls the feelings** (frontal cortex manages the reptilian brain).
3.  **Chemical Cascade:** Extending the brain metaphor, the mind-body connection is described as a "chemical" process. A wholesome attitude creates a "chemical" in the mind that positively influences the "chemicals" of feeling in the reptilian brain, which then affects the body's "chemistry." This illustrates how a changed mental attitude can lead to psychosomatic well-being.
4.  **Monks Eat Like Lions:** This metaphor, attributed to Ajahn Po, describes the monastic relationship with food. Like a lion that feasts after a kill and then fasts, a monk accepts times of abundance and times of scarcity with equanimity. The emphasis is on the **attitude toward what is given**, not on choice or preference.
5.  **Falling from Floors:** Speaker B uses a quick metaphor for resisting healing: *"It's like you would rather fall from the first floor than from the fifth floor. So you're just going to stay down."* This illustrates how people can cling to a familiar state of suffering (being "down") to avoid the perceived greater pain of change or the potential for another "fall."
6.  **Dogs as Dharma Teachers:** A light metaphor suggesting that even everyday interactions with animals (like dogs, which were present in the Buddha's time) can offer lessons in mindfulness and naturalness, contrasting them with contrived sensual pleasures.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha Laying Down to Rest:** Speaker A recounts a story from the Majjhima Nikaya where the Buddha, due to back pain, asks Ananda to teach while he rests. The point is to show that resting is a natural, needed action. The story is used to critique a common misinterpretation: Western practitioners often turn the Buddha's practical advice ("lie down to rest") into a rigid, self-punishing rule ("thou shalt not lie down").
2.  **Speaker A's Childhood and Sickness:** He shares a personal story about his father's attitude: being told "You're not sick! Get up and go to school!" when he felt ill. This anecdote illustrates how **attitude can shape physical experience**, leading him to rarely identify as "sick" and to see minor ailments as "trivial stuff."
3.  **Donald Trump Sleeping in Court:** Used as a modern, pop-culture example to explain the connection between mental activity, poor breathing, and tiredness. The story demonstrates that fatigue often comes not from physical exertion but from mental strain coupled with shallow breathing—a lead-in to the importance of *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing).
4.  **Food Distribution at Wat Tulapatthan:** Speaker A describes his experience on alms round, where excess food from monks was given to a nearby school. This story serves two purposes: it contrasts modest monastic practice with modern conveniences (like using plates), and it highlights the interconnected, supportive role of a monastery in its community.
5.  **The Person with Depression in Bed:** A brief story-like description of someone who stays in bed not to rest, but to wallow in depressive thoughts ("poor me"). This is used to argue that what is often called "clinical depression" is, from this perspective, the habit of "enjoying feeling bad" or "depressing their joy," emphasizing the role of mental attitude.

### **Overall Narrative Theme**
The entire conversation is framed by a **core story about re-education.** It's about unlearning Western cultural conditioning (where mistakes are bad and must lead to guilt) and learning the "disposition of the Buddha," where every event, including errors, is merely an opportunity to observe the presence or absence of Dukkha. The metaphors and anecdotes are all tools to explain how to make this shift: by changing perception, using the wise mind to manage feelings, and cultivating an attitude of a "champion" or "winner" towards all experiences, including sickness, tiredness, and heat.
