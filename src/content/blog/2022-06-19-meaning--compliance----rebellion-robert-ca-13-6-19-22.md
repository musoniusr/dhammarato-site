### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Be with no goals, but then I will, um, I will, I will then be like depressed that I don't have any goals to pursue, and so I'll start suffering again. And then as soon as I make a goal to pursue, like a meaning of my life, I then start suffering because I don't have like the willpower to execute on said goal. So I'm either like depressed, so I'm just suffering like either way. And it's like, it's like these, these two grooves are so, I feel like, worn down in my brain that it just, it slides into them so much easier than just being happy.

**Speaker B:** Well, those are the two, uh, ways that most people get caught in. And they both have to do with the dumb animal doing what it's supposed to do. This is the woeful state. You, you've heard about that, I'm sure, about the four modes of clinging bring about the four woeful states: hungry ghost, hell worlds, being reborn as an animal, being reborn as a frightened Asura. Okay, so being reborn as an animal in that moment means like a draft animal. Normally Westerners, when they think about animals, they think about bugs and flies and fish and that kind of stuff other than work animals. But draft animals that are put to work is what we do with animals that are smart enough to be put to work. Dogs, cattle, horses, sheep— we can put all of those animals to work. They're domesticated. Guess what? Humans are too. Domesticated, trained, put to work. All right, and so whenever we think in that regard, that's the kind of getting put to work. Now there's two responses to that, and that is going along and getting along and remaining dissatisfied, or wanting to rebel against it. But both of those are Dukkha. Does this fit in with what you're um, talking about here, that you've got something that you're supposed to do, and if you do it, you feel bad, and if you don't, you feel bad.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly right.

**Speaker B:** If, if you don't do it, then you can feel guilty for a while, and then you get tired of that, and so we rebel against it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Then we go back and we do it again. So we're either doing what we're told to do, rebelling against what we're told to do, or feeling guilty about not doing what we're told to do. Those are normally our three options.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, precisely. That's exactly the rut that I'm stuck in.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Well, guess what? Because I know it so succinctly and see it so clearly, it must mean that you're not the only one that's ever had it.

**Speaker A:** Makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Makes sense that this is a common thing that happens. In our culture. So, uh, but that's not your only choices. The choice that you have is to wake up to this stuff instead of falling into it over and over and over again. That actually you listen to these thoughts that you're having. And so one of the ways that I would talk about it because I was just mentioning that with the other Robert, is to start guarding this mind door. Start listening to this stuff with discerning eyes. Is this really helpful and wholesome for me to think these kind of thoughts? And so back to basic Anapanasati, but we're actually looking at it from the perspective of these thoughts are unwholesome. When you tell yourself something to do Your three choices are to go along to get along, but you don't like it and you're not getting any results, or you don't do it and then you feel either guilty or rebellious. When are we going to learn to wake up that we've got a choice about whether we're going to do it or not? And if we do it, we still have a choice about whether we're going to enjoy doing it.

**Speaker A:** Well, see, this is the thing. I try to look at these thoughts through the lens of practice, through the lens of Anapanasati. Are they wholesome? Are they unwholesome? Are they like a victim thing and we want to avoid that? And or they're affirming I'm a winner. And I try to do that, but in the moment, um, my mind will kind of just like— it'll, it'll basically like bring into question like, like these like deeper existential issues to try and convince me not to do it. And they do kind of seem like pertinent in the moment, even though I know better. Like, it'll say, like, in other words.

**Speaker B:** You'Re trying to tell me now about all the sides of the rabbit hole that you're going down.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to go this way, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the whole point, is these existential questions, as I mentioned before, existential means that they are outside They're outside the boundaries. There's something that we don't need to know. And there you go, jumping into all the things, thinking that that kind of stuff is going to answer your question. To where the— a better, much better question would be, is that thought wholesome? The answer is no, it's not. It's not wholesome. It's giving me orders of things that ought to be done, or places to go, or things to do. And right now I'm not about to go anyplace or do anything. I'm going to sit here and enjoy not going anyplace or not doing anything. That's your choice. But instead, you're in that kind of rebellious, guilty back and forth, trying to find the right justification. And it's all just— wakey wakey to that stuff and recognize you don't need to put that stuff in here, that that's an old habit. They're trying to justify either doing it or not doing it, and recognize that that pattern is unnecessary. You don't have to even ask yourself those kind of questions at all. You can just sit and enjoy yourself.

**Speaker A:** I'll be back in one second. Hi, sorry about that. I, um, I hear what you're saying. I hear what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Um, I've never said much of anything else. We had to keep coming back to this because you keep giving these thoughts that you're having some sort of importance.

**Speaker A:** It's just habitual, isn't it? It's just that these patterns of thinking have become habitual, so I'm kind of— that's why they're the natural thing that I will fall into so easily. That's— yeah, it's all of this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that's what makes them heavy and important, is because we keep doing it over and over and over again until it gets heavy on the mind, and we mistake heaviness with importance. So when you just recognize that that stuff is heavy but it's not important, it's existential, you throw it out and have fun instead. Don't worry, be happy, they say. And here you are talking about, well, what's the correct way to worry?

**Speaker A:** That's a really good point. What's the correct way to find? Oh my God. And then obviously I never find an answer and it just goes around.

**Speaker B:** And so you now, you know that Ferris wheel, you see the various seats that you sit in as you go around that Ferris wheel. And you don't enjoy the ride.

**Speaker A:** The thing about them is, you know, in that moment it's like—.

**Speaker B:** It's like not wakey wakey.

**Speaker A:** I'm trying to think how to describe it.

**Speaker B:** Best not to. Best to recognize that you want to describe something that's not really relevant or important. You're still trying to make it important. You're still trying to make it important enough to describe it, and it's not even— I mean, leave it indescribable. You don't have to inspect every nit. Make it big and important. We can set that stuff down.

**Speaker A:** I spent like, um, like 2 hours yesterday. It was more than 2, actually. It was like It was a number, like over different points in the day, just like trying to really sit with these existential problems, so to speak, like meaninglessness, hopelessness, those kind of things, like just like really like sitting with them and like meditating on them.

**Speaker B:** Wait a minute, is meaninglessness and hopelessness, are those good things or bad things? How do you feel about meaninglessness? I love it.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is the thing. This is what I was trying to do. I was thinking like, if I really sit with these and I sit with the pain, can I do that to change my relationship with them? Because I don't like them at all. And in the end— Why not?

**Speaker B:** Isn't it marvelous that you've got everything that you need, that everything right now is so wonderful that there's nothing to hope for? You're hopeless. You've already got everything you need. Everything is marvelous right now. This is it. I've got you, see. I've got my pals. Who could ask for anything more?

**Speaker A:** See, the problem is now you've got me convinced, so I can't think where I was coming from with those questions initially because I'm already like feeling good.

**Speaker B:** Yes, meaninglessness. We are taught, basically you could say that meaning is the fundamental point of religion. They try to give people meaning in their lives. By telling them some sort of ghost story. And so the story has meaning. Some stories, some versions of the story have ghosts and spooks, and some of the versions of the stories have virgins, you know, no-knock-up babes. And other versions of it have three gods in one. There's just all kinds of stories that people have. Thinking that that stuff has meaning, including sky daddies. Okay. And in Asia, they have meaning in the sense of if you do a good action, you'll get a good result. And if you do a bad action, you'll do a bad result. Okay. And that gives meaning to people's lives as well as they've got their own magical stories. So mostly what gives us meaning in life is remote possibilities. And if we recognize that basically I don't need a meaning, things don't mean much of anything, and then we begin to understand that everything only had a meaning so far as I gave it in the first place, that this is actually a process of the mind. That what things are, are as they are, and they have no meaning. It's just the ramble of the universe, and that all meaning comes from something that you want out of it.

**Speaker A:** I like that description a lot.

**Speaker B:** And that's where meaning is. This is actually part of the teaching of the Buddha on Sunyata. Emptiness. But the Buddha stays with the point, because if you unravel this correctly, you'll understand the entire teaching. And that is the main issue of emptiness is everything is devoid of a self. It has no inherent nature. Some people will say, oh, the Buddha teaches that the inherent nature of things is Dukkha. No, that's a mental construction. But the Buddha teaches that nothing has an inherent nature. Everything is made up of constituent component parts. And the question that we have is, what can we see the difference between what is actually really there and what are the things that we're adding to it with our imaginations? Because we were taught to do that. We give meaning to things where in fact it doesn't mean anything at all. A clear example of that is all the synchronicity that happens on these calls. It's quite amazing when the students will say, well, I was just, you know, that's the job that I have when I'm talking about dishwashers. And I mentioned a song and they say, oh, well, that song is actually right now on the turntable. We played it just last night and here you are talking about it. And then people will try to make meaning out of all of that stuff. And I just get a big kick out of it. I don't have to understand it or try to make meaning or make connections. We can just see the stuff. OK. So if we try to give meaning to it, then we are grasping at something that we cannot get. That's the same thing as hope. Hope actually means that you're wanting something and that you're using the word hope rather than the word want. Trying to make your wanting somehow noble. But all it is is just wanting something that you don't have. That's what hope is. And if you don't hope for anything because everything you know is going to work out just fine without any efforts or any worries or any flurries, it's just everything's going to be all right, everything's going to be fine, then I don't have to then spend my time hoping. And if I put that hope into a very high-quality formal setting, I can call it prayer.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** I want God to change his plan. Oh, Mr. God in the sky, please change your eternal plan. I know you've had it for centuries and millennium, but I want you to change it because little old me wants things to be different than they are. I want Granny to get up out of that bed, and she knows, everybody knows, and in fact it's easy to see she's going to die within the next few hours. Please pick her up and put her on her feet, Mr. God.

**Speaker A:** It is quite an absurd proposition, really. I feel like Christianity is just like kind of an absurd religion, like like a heaven and a hell. And then like, I don't know, man, I don't know how people believe that.

**Speaker B:** Well, guess what? Even though you don't believe it on the surface, you're still believing it at a deeper level, because that's what all of this is about when you start talking about meaning. Because if there is no heaven, there is no hell, that those are just stories that they tell kids to make them behave themselves. Then what is the meaning of life? What's it all about, Alfie? Okay, or the other song is 'Is That All There Is,' and that's about it.

**Speaker A:** I don't know either of those songs. I'll have to check them out after the call.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the name of one of those songs, 'Is That All There Is.' And my statement is very close to that, and that is, is that all there is to it? Because it's a completely different frame of reference. When we say, is that all there is, that means that I want it to be more. But when I say, is that all there is to it, that means that I'm really happy that this is all there is. This is it.

**Speaker A:** It's a subtle switch in the language.

**Speaker B:** And the subtle sense switch in your attitude.

**Speaker A:** My attitude, right, right.

**Speaker B:** So when you're looking for meaning and you're hoping for something, then you're singing the song, is that all there is? And you're doing it from a state of disappointment. But when you say, is that all there is to it, then that means that you're successful.

**Speaker A:** It's remarkable how everything you say can make so much sense to me when I'm in a good mood, and somehow so little when I'm in a bad mood. And like, in a couple hours, like tomorrow, like, I'm pretty sure there's going to be a point during the day where I'm going to feel awful. And this, all of this, which makes perfect sense now, which is, it clicks, it all fits into place, is just going to be like, it feels like I'll just be like pulling at straws.

**Speaker B:** Like, well, you have to remember when you're about to get into a bad mood. Don't go into the bad mood. Say, hot dog, I'm about to go into a bad mood. I caught you, bad mood.

**Speaker A:** And don't see the signs. See the signs.

**Speaker B:** Your signs. You already know that. You're beginning to pick this stuff up for yourself, so you can see this stuff coming. Pay attention. Wakey wakey. Watch when you're about to become dissatisfied. Watch when you're thinking your thoughts of wanting something. And I'm not saying don't want anything, but the easier way to do it is only want things that are immediately available to you. You know, little simple things like I want to go to the toilet, so I'll go to the toilet. I want a cup of coffee, so I'll get coffee. I want to say hi to my friends, and so I'll say hi to my friend.

**Speaker A:** If I want— if I want a meaning of life, can I just give myself one?

**Speaker B:** Well, I know it's already been doing that. Where else is it going to get any meaning at all? In fact, that's a way of looking at it, is that the— let us say that meaning is on a blackboard in some school, and that blackboard can be erased, and anything you want to can be drawn back up there on that blackboard. But now they use whiteboard and magic markers. We use chalk and slate. All right. So that's the whole point, is that it is there. Now that reminds me of an old joke, and the joke is that the young seeker wanted to find what was the key, what was the key to the universe. And so he went to Asia and started looking around and found about this guru and that guru, and he finally climbed this really high mountain in the Himalayas to this old guru that he heard about. When he finally gets there, all huffing and puffing, he sits down to catch his breath, and the old guru opens one eye. And then the student says, "Please, sir, what is the key to the universe?" The old man opens his eyes and says, "I don't know." I didn't know that the universe was locked. Okay, now that's the point. The universe has been unlocked, and what you're looking for when you say the meaning of life is you're looking for the key, and it's already been left unlocked. You don't need a key.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all you have to do is remember that it is unlocked and you don't need the key. Yeah, and here you are worrying yourself about a key, something that you need, some meaning to life. Yeah, but back to the question that you were asking, the obvious answer is Yes, now that you know that, why don't you put meaning in your life that is absolutely ecstatic? Your choice. You can put any meaning on your life that you want to, moment by moment, as you remember. As Rocky says, I could have been a contender. Well, you are a contender already. You could be a champion.

**Speaker A:** But hold it lightly as well. Don't take it as worth suffering over, because I slip over that line so easily when I find something that I'm enjoying. Like, say I'm watching an episode of a TV show I'm enjoying, and I go from enjoying it to enjoying it less when I really start enjoying it. Because I go from liking it to wanting it, and I'm still liking it, but I'm also wanting it at the same time. And I can see how that then means, like, when that show goes away—.

**Speaker B:** And giving it meaning, right? Yes, making it important. Precisely. And the reality is, is that when that TV show is over, it's gone and it's over. Go do something else. But here you are trying to cling to it because you think that good, useful, valuable, and wholesome, to where in fact it's quite ephemeral. There's nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** There's actually a really interesting study by Leigh Brazington that someone shared on Discord that I will— I'll send you the link of— that's about the difference between serotonin and dopamine. And I was thinking about it because it seems really similar to the wanting. And to their liking, and how they affect our brain. Apparently serotonin makes you feel like you are enjoying yourself and you're satisfied with it, whereas dopamine feels like you're enjoying yourself but you want more of that feeling of dopamine. So it's like enjoying with craving, where serotonin is enjoying without craving. And there was also even other details about how serotonin is normally shared um, with other people versus dopamine is about personal achievement. And like, this really interesting comparison between the two chemicals. I thought that was— I thought I wanted to— I wanted to mention that and share that with you because I feel like, I feel like, uh, you'll get a kick out of reading that science.

**Speaker B:** Oh, but that's, that's old data. That's, that's not new. I don't think— oh, is it not? I think— I don't think that Lee Brassington did that research. He's just repeating— oh, for sure, for sure.

**Speaker A:** He just Yeah, yeah, for sure. He just wrote about it in an article. Sorry, I didn't mean he did the studies. I mean, he made an article based on the studies. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So anyway, yes, this is quite well known, and that dopamine hit is the liking, but it really goes south in the sense of then we begin to want it. Oh, I like that. Let me get a hit of it again. Let me get a hit of it again. I want more. I want that. I like that. I want more and more.

**Speaker A:** More.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's why in fact striptease works. That's what it means. The striptease, keep the dopamine going, keep teasing and teasing and teasing. But either it never delivers or the final payoff is an actual trap. Okay, which means that, uh, big payment, balloon payment at the end, those kind of things would happen. But the striptease is to tease one. They do that with little breadcrumbs to get the rats or the squirrels to go under the box so the kid can pull the string and trap the squirrel. That's the teasing. That's the dopamine. We keep hitting that dopamine over and over and over again, and we keep wanting more of it. The serotonin is different than that because that has to do with satisfaction. And so basically, the Anapanasati practice is really to stop putting people in the state of wanting and wanting and wanting and dopamine and searching for that, and come into real satisfaction, which is a serotonin rather than a dopamine. So come out of our dopamine world and come into a serotonin world.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and there's nothing like inherently wrong with any particular type of thought. It's just if it's wholesome or if it's unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Right. And we could then go so far as to say that now we've got a new set of labels that we can put on that in the sense of brain chemistry, and that we can say that dopamine would be unwholesome and serotonin would be wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what's been really interesting is since reading that research, it's been really cool to notice how these different chemicals feel like in the body and in the mind, because it also talks about how dopamine is more in the body and then serotonin is more above the head. And just noticing like these sensations in the body correlating to these like chemicals and stuff. And that's been like pretty interesting.

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure if they have run across it yet. But it seems to me that what you're suggesting is, is that dopamine is somehow related to adrenaline and cortisol. In other words, if we want something, then we're going to get into that fight-or-flight movement to get it, just like fear. So fear is one kind of chemical, and that happens with the amygdala, which is located kind of in and back. You can think of it as the part of the brain that's closest to the back of the throat. That's the amygdala, and that's the sense of the source of fear or terror. You can also say that that's the source of the self-preservation instinct, that there's actually an area of the brain that is pointed out, and it's right there with the hippocampus and that area of the brain. So the dopamine is much more in this area of the brain, the higher part. Of the brain, of the reptilian brain. But all of the chemical work like that is produced from the glandular system that's associated with the pineal and the pituitary glands. And so dopamine and serotonin and all of that kind of stuff— well, serotonin actually is produced more, let us say, locally to where dopamine spreads, just like adrenaline and other fluids like that. But this information is quite useful to some of us scientists, but it was irrelevant to the Buddha. We didn't need that kind of language to understand the process. We can see the process, the way that the mind works is that if we like something, if we're not careful, we'll start wanting it.

**Speaker A:** That's the thing. That's the thing. Yeah, the desirousness comes in. And then you start stressing out about it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so if we can recognize that we like it, but we don't want it, that I'm satisfied without it here, I'll have some serotonin, please, along with my dopamine. So now we're talking about Paticcasamuppada. Right at that point of Paticcasamuppada is where the Vedana comes the feelings. If those feelings— if we're wise when those feelings arise, or at the contact, then we can say, I do like it, that bikini is quite beautiful. And all the imaginary things that are in my mind is behind that bikini, but all I see is bikini, you see. All right, but I like it, but I don't want it. I'm satisfied without it. Nice, nice visual image. Let it pass. I've seen that, been there, done that. But if I see that bikini and I say, oh, there's something behind there and I want it, now we begin to go into completely different mental state.

**Speaker A:** There's a whole shift of attitude. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So this is why the Buddha talks about wisdom at the point of contact. So that when we see something, or another way of saying it, guard the eye door, guard the ear door. If someone is criticizing you, guard your ear door so that you don't grab that painful data and stick it in your mind and stab yourself with it.

**Speaker A:** Straight up. That's something I've kind of realized this, well, more and more over the course of my life, but kind of this week especially is like Before, I kind of thought like, you know, it's kind of good to have like triggering things because then, you know, it's a real test of your strength. And so it was like this, it was like this kind of like macho idea getting like, like put into the practice where it's like, oh, if I'm around things that like trigger me to do bad habits, then that just means I'm that much stronger. But whereas actually if I just straight up remove those triggers, um, or by practice I just mean like freaking out emotionally and stuff, like getting emotional. Like, if I just remove those, that just makes it that much easier, like less work to do. I'm more satisfied. It's like, there's nothing wrong with just like removing environmental triggers and stuff.

**Speaker B:** All right, so now we got a couple of new triggers to pop in that list, and that is hoping and meaning. Because things don't have to mean anything at all. Or if you want them to have meaning, that's your choice. But recognize that you're making the choice of giving something meaning and that it's just temporary and you could change your meaning later.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like the meaning I've been giving them for practical purposes— experiences, I mean— is just like to gladden the mind when I'm unhappy, to become happy again. And then sometimes like I'll need to motivate myself to do that, and then I'll get a bit more detailed and I'll say, you know, I'm doing this because if I get good at gladdening the mind now, in the future, my, you know, I'll naturally be less stressed out and stuff.

**Speaker B:** And so right now, that's something that they— that's kind of hoping. That's the victim. All right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So another way you can say that, it is, hey, I can do better than that right now. I'm better than that right now. I don't have to hope for doing better than this later. I can do it right now. And that's the winner's attitude. To take that meaning, it means that, hey, you could do this right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sometimes I feel like I need to take those kind of like baby steps in a sense in order to—.

**Speaker B:** You've been taking too many baby steps. Now let's take a full trot.

**Speaker A:** Okay, fair play.

**Speaker B:** Take a big stride, take it, take a leap. The leap right out of the, um, uh, the victimhood into I can do this.

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can do this. You know you can do this. Come on, admit that you could do this. You've done it so many times before and you're still doubting that you could do it when you know you could do it.

**Speaker A:** That's a good point.

**Speaker B:** And that even is a kind of clinging to meaning. And you can drop that meaning and you can give yourself a new meaning. And one of the best meanings is that don't mean nothing. You don't have a meaning at all. There's nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel like I need to already be really happy though to like be able to handle that, because if I'm in a bad mood and I try to use that, like my mind will like twist it around to become a negative thing.

**Speaker B:** And, um, ah, but you need to get yourself into a state of being able to see that as it approaches and taking a deep breath and not go into that state. And when you get into that state and you can't get out, you can still remember over and over again, hey, this don't mean nothing. Hey, I'm in a funk and it don't matter. Hey, I can get myself out of this right now. I can take another deep breath and I can say, see, I'm already coming out of it. Haha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Preempt, preempt the, the, uh, the overreaction.

**Speaker B:** Oh, when you're in it, you can plan on coming right back out of it because you've got the attitude that you can come right back out of it. Don't mean anything. You, you have heard of quicksand, and you know how many movies have quicksand. Yeah, very, very few people have ever seen quicksand. I have seen quicksand. I have been in quicksand. I understand quicksand. And there's an easy way that you can always get out of it. But you see, if you're trying to pull this foot up, you're using the other foot to push down. You know the right way to come out of quicksand?

**Speaker A:** Oh, you've just got to lay down, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, to take a deep breath and lay down, and your feet will float right up to the surface, and then you can butterfly your way to whatever shore you want to go to. Yeah, it's easy, easy to come out of quicksand.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the easy but scary route, because I feel like putting my head or whatever, or like even like my upper body on the quicksand, like pretty terrifying in the moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's— I recognize that that's how we actually practicing Anapanasati is. Remember when you've gotten into quicksand, if you try to pull yourself out of it, you're going to get stuck deeper. What you need to do is to lay down, relax, and take a deep breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like from Arahant, everything is meaningless. Is meaning this. Yeah, that makes sense to me. That communicates. So, um, so here's another question for you. Um, is it okay to, uh, romanticize our life to gladden the mind, or is it better not to go into that type of thought? Um, by that I mean like exaggerated versions of how good life is, like life is amazing, like the sun is shining, sunlight gives love to the Earth. I mean, these sound good, but like in the moment when I'm sad, like it really seems like I'm— yeah, I don't know, it's kind of— okay, let.

**Speaker B:** Me think about it.

**Speaker A:** You know, like making things sound good.

**Speaker B:** I understand. Okay, the answer to that is, is that the things that you used as examples were here-now kinds of things. The sun is shining, it's the morning, it's raining, the sun is out, the wind is blowing. These are the kind of things that we can actually— those are real. Okay, this is not romanticizing. This is appreciating the reality of your life, and it's time that you do that. Romanticizing is something completely different, and that is, oh, I can imagine this to be better than it is. I'm trying to give it a different meaning. I'm hoping. That's romanticizing. Romanticizing is the kind of a hoping for things to get better.

**Speaker A:** That makes a lot of sense. That makes a lot of sense, actually. That's exactly what I mean. I didn't know it, but that's exactly what I mean. It's like, yeah, wishful thinking, like making things like I'm in heaven, like saying this is Nirvana, like, because I don't really believe that, like, you know, like dismissing all the bad stuff, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you're wanting it to be better rather than In a way, there's two ways of saying it in the sense of this is Nibbana is kind of hoping for it or wishful thinking or romanticizing. And then there is this Nibbana, which is mean, wow, this is really nice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like the rational down-to-earth versus like kind of exaggerated romanticized thing. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So that's the meaning then. The meaning is that stuff that we add to it. The wanting it, the hoping, all of that stuff is additions that we add to the reality instead of actually just appreciating the reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, because that's what it feels like a lot of time, is it feels like I'm trying to trick myself into believing some exaggerated claim about the way things are. I'm like, you know, I know like spiritual people say that things are great and the universe is made of unconditional love, but like it clearly isn't like Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Well, let us say it this way. That's a mistake. That's romanticizing it. The way to find— the way to state it better is that I can find love in every corner of the universe. That's more real. Okay, which is basically just the confidence that I can handle whatever happens. Which is completely different than that romanticizing of the world is a marvelous place. Yeah, because that's too broad in the sense that, well, we need to look at some definitions. The planet Earth is fine with and without humans, but human society is what we normally call the world. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** A quick example of that in the practice of Metta meditations. No doubt you've probably heard of the idea of the six points of the compass.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I have. Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Radiating to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and to down below and up above and all of that. Okay. And that's giving people an image of the world. Conceptualized image. The reality is, is that those six compasses can mean something real if you understand it correctly. And that is the people right in front of me, the people who are behind me trying to stab me in the back, the people above me who I appreciate to be above me, the people who are down below me, which are the ones that are service to me. And in our society, that would be people who wait on our tables, the people who cashier, the people who pump gas, the workers, all of that. On this side I have my family, and on this side I have my friends. That's it. Front and back. In other words, we're talking about the immediate universe, the reality that we live in. That's our world. That's the real— the real world is only the people that we contact. Only the things that we actually see. My relationship to that bird over my shoulder that's saying cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo is there because he's there and we're close and I can hear him. But I do not have to conceptualize that bird to being way off some other place. No, he's close by. So when you— so this is a way of Beginning to understand that we can close down our conceptualized world until it becomes real, because there is a real world, but it's the real world of our senses, the real world of our people around us, those things that we find on the six points of the compass, not the things that are way out west or way up north or way down south, back east. Anagami, or up in the high. Okay, that's conceptualized world that we, most of us, live in. That's the world that you're romanticizing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, that, that makes sense. That makes sense. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right, because the present moment— not present moment, the, um, the world of our senses. That's what I mean.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the authentic real world we live in, in our senses, is really a beautiful idea to start appreciating that, to appreciate the people around you, to appreciate that life that just moved by, appreciate the peace that just arrived.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's right, the sunshine and stuff.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. To start paying attention to what's real rather than paying attention to conceptualizations.

**Speaker A:** That's actually really key. Yeah, really key for me because I can't remember what I was going to say, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Other than trying to think of my whole life or the whole universe, God forbid, in like absolutely good terms, which just feels like I'm kidding myself. Yeah, we don't know that.

**Speaker B:** In fact, you don't have any you don't have any responsibility and you don't have any ability to make changes to the grand universe. So your meaning is meaningless because you've got no possibility of putting your meaning on the world or the universe to bring that about. Right, that's exactly it. That's what brings it back down to, with a sledgehammer, wanting things you cannot have. So it's better to want the things that you can have, and one of the ways of doing that is by coming out of conceptualized world into the world of reality that you're actually in.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Want the things we can have, which are the things that are already here, right? My chair is comfortable, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, precisely. Or as they sometimes say, the best things in life are free because here they are.

**Speaker A:** Because here they are, the little things. I've really noticed that. I really noticed, I was contemplating this earlier, how even when you're super rich and successful, the 99.99% of your life is the exact same as when you're poor. You're still eating the same tastes, you're tasting the same tastes on your taste buds, you're going to sleep with, you know, like pillows and stuff. Like all the little things are like the same, you know, it's like like the comfort of your bed, right? The comfort of your chair, you know, like, you know, just like you're probably going to sit and look at a computer screen most of the day or your phone or whatever, like, like all the little things in life. The sun is going to look the same way. It's still going to rain at the same time of day, you know, like it's 90% at least it's like same.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And the funny part in that regard is that the amount of money that they have is irrelevant. Because they all still feel like they want more.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the thing. That's the crazy thing. And it's so crazy for me because I was just noticing how much of just excuses I was making for myself because I'm not at this particular level that I want to be at financially. I need to get there before. But As soon as I get there, that's just, again, it's just like an arbitrary thing. It's like appreciating the little things. I feel like it's so important. It's the mundane everyday stuff.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's all there is, is the mundane everything. In fact, That's where meaning is, the mundane everything. And the distinction between exalted and mundane is your attitude. What else could possibly be the difference between ordinary mundane and exalted other than someone's attitude? You say, oh well, if a lot of people have the attitude that it's exalted, then that must make it exalted. Especially if the entire Christian world thinks it's exalted, then it must be exalted. You've heard things like that, that 50 million Frenchmen couldn't be wrong when they voted against having World War II. So just because there's mass numbers of people who have one opinion or another of it doesn't mean that you have to be a dumb animal that goes along to get along. That you have a choice, and you can make it ordinary at one moment and make it exalted the next, and know that you have that power.

**Speaker A:** I was just gonna say, well, like, those like 50 million people who like have the opposite opinion to me, they're not like— they're not in the world of my senses, you know. They're not the little things, you know. There's so much like joy that I can find here, you know. If I— if I'm— if I'm— if I have the right attitude, you know, I can find that joy. Otherwise it's gonna seem like more shit.

**Speaker B:** Actually, that's exactly right. In fact, one of the ways of saying it then is the right attitude is everything is already— I don't have to go looking for it to find it, there it is. But if I have an attitude of being a victim, that means it's not there and I got to go look for it. That's the hope, that's the meaning in all of that. That's the victim's position. You don't have to go find it, it's already here. That's the best part, is you don't have to do anything except appreciate that which has already been given to you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I like that. I think this is going to be my approach as well going forward, um, is, is focusing on the, uh, the stuff that's right here in the senses as well, rather than the ideas and stuff. And I noticed when you pointed it out, and I noticed as well, like, even in that question, uh, is it okay to romanticize our life? Like, romanticized means like our life in that context was meaning like my ideas of my life. Like, it was talking about like my life as a whole, the world as a whole. Like, I think my approach is just going to be to forget about that and just for now focus on the simple little stuff that's already here. So I really feel like that, that's definitely— I feel like the impression I get is like that grounds me more, you know, and that stops me going into these thought loops about the existential nature of things, you know, just like stay grounded in reality. Staying like, like on the level of.

**Speaker B:** Nature doesn't have any existential. That's the whole point.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Like on that level, that's just like grounded. Like I'm not getting lost in the meaning of my life or goals or purpose or any of that. Just like, just like, just like keep it simple. Keep it like, keep it classic, you know, like just like what did people 5,000 years ago Yeah, keep it real. Yeah, straight up.

**Speaker B:** Keep it real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. I think that's got to be the way to go because it's like we discussed, like these things, they just turn into rabbit holes and they're just never-ending.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And we don't need to know all of that data that's down in those rabbit holes. We don't need any of that. We could just be happy. Never mind. I don't need to know the answer to the universe. I don't need to know— don't have to have the key to the universe. It's been left unlocked.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't need to fix every problem for every person.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, just because they think they've got a problem. What problem? What, me worry?

**Speaker A:** I hear you, Dhammarato. I hear you. Well, I appreciate the help this evening.

**Speaker B:** This is great.

**Speaker A:** Morning for you.

**Speaker B:** I really enjoy our game together. This is such fun.

**Speaker A:** The regular calls is really helpful to keep me on track and I can get my thoughts out in the moment and like get help with it instead of like spending like a week. Because sometimes like I'll spend like a week just on like one issue and it won't get resolved. Um, and because I'm just like stuck in my brain, it's just like literally like it's just stuck in that mode. Like, I forget about everything else.

**Speaker B:** It's not stuck, it just keeps falling back there. But you can pick yourself up, dust yourself off, start looking down the road again. You know, you fall down again, never mind, start again. Yeah, call off it. We keep doing this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's good, it's very helpful.

**Speaker B:** Change of attitude. You're a lion.

**Speaker A:** I'm a peaceful lion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Making friends with the zebras.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So yeah, we'll see you in a few days then. See you soon.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll see you soon. Ciao. Thanks again.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a student's (Speaker A) struggle with existential suffering, specifically the trap of feeling depressed without goals and overwhelmed when trying to pursue them. Here is a structured summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: The "Two Grooves" of Suffering**
The student describes being stuck in two painful mental patterns:
1.  **Depression from meaninglessness:** Feeling lost and suffering when having no goals or purpose.
2.  **Anxiety from obligation:** Suffering when setting a goal due to a lack of willpower to execute it, leading to guilt and rebellion.
Dhammarato identifies this as the common human predicament of being a "domesticated animal"—either resignedly doing what we feel we *should* do (and resenting it) or rebelling against it (and feeling guilty). Both are forms of **Dukkha** (suffering/stress).

### **The Solution: Waking Up & Changing Your Relationship to Thought**
The way out is not to find the "right" goal or meaning, but to change your relationship to the thoughts themselves.

1.  **Guard the Sense Doors & Discern Thoughts:** Don't automatically believe or follow every thought. Use the lens of practice (like **Anapanasati** - mindfulness of breathing) to ask: **"Is this thought wholesome or unwholesome?"** The repetitive, heavy thoughts about meaning and obligation are unwholesome because they lead to suffering.
2.  **You Have a Choice:** Recognize you have a choice beyond just compliance or rebellion. You can choose:
    *   **Whether to engage** with a demand/thought.
    *   **Your attitude** while doing something—you can choose to enjoy the present activity instead of seeing it as a burden.
3.  **Stop Giving Importance to "Existential" Thoughts:** Dhammarato stresses that "existential" questions are, by definition, outside useful boundaries. Grappling with "the meaning of life" is a rabbit hole. These thoughts are **heavy from habit, but not important**. The task is to "wake up" to their repetitive, unhelpful nature and **set them down**.

### **Key Reframes on Meaning, Hope, and Happiness**
*   **Meaning:** Is not inherent; it's a mental projection. We are taught to look for meaning in stories (religious or otherwise) or future results. True freedom comes from realizing **things don't have to mean anything**, or that you can lightly assign a useful meaning without clinging to it. "The universe isn't locked; you don't need a key."
*   **Hope:** Is often just a disguised form of **wanting** (craving) for things to be other than they are. It keeps you dissatisfied. The alternative is **confidence and satisfaction** with what is available here and now.
*   **Happiness vs. Romanticizing:** There's a crucial difference:
    *   **Appreciating Reality:** Noticing and gladdening the mind with what is *actually present and true* in your immediate sensory world (e.g., sunshine, a comfortable chair, a friend's voice). This is wholesome.
    *   **Romanticizing:** Creating exaggerated, wishful stories about how things *should be* (e.g., "life is perfect unconditional love"). This is a form of hoping and leads to disappointment.

### **Practical Instructions & Analogies**
*   **Focus on the Immediate & Mundane:** Shift attention from the conceptualized "big" world (life, universe, purpose) to the **real world of your direct senses and immediate relationships** ("the six points of the compass"). The profound is found in appreciating the ordinary.
*   **Want What You Can Have:** Direct desire towards simple, immediately available things (a cup of coffee, a breath, a stretch). This ends the frustration of wanting what you cannot have.
*   **The Quicksand Analogy:** Struggling against a bad mood or obsessive thought cycle only sinks you deeper. The solution is to **relax, take a deep breath, and "lay down"**—stop struggling and let mindfulness float you free.
*   **Dopamine vs. Serotonin (Modern Framing):** The discussion connects the Dharma to neuroscience:
    *   **Dopamine:** The "craving" chemical—linked to the cycle of liking, wanting more, and stress.
    *   **Serotonin:** The "satisfaction" chemical—linked to contentment and peace.
    *   The practice aims to move from a dopamine-driven, craving mind to a serotonin-rich, satisfied mind.

### **Conclusion: The Attitude Shift**
The ultimate teaching is a shift in **attitude** from a **victim** (needing to find meaning, hoping for change, feeling stuck) to a **winner/champion** (knowing you have a choice, confidence in your ability to gladden the mind now, appreciating what is already here). The key is to **keep it real, grounded in present sensory experience**, and to drop the heavy, habitual burden of existential questioning.

**In essence:** Don't search for the meaning of life. Instead, cultivate the skill of discerning unwholesome thoughts, drop them, and choose to find satisfaction and appreciation in the simple, real, and readily available experiences of the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several powerful metaphors and stories to illustrate the core teaching about escaping the cycles of suffering caused by seeking meaning, goals, and hope. Here are the main ones:

**1. The Draft Animal / Domesticated Human**
*   **Metaphor:** Humans are compared to domesticated draft animals (horses, oxen) that are trained and put to work.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the feeling of being trapped in societal conditioning. We feel we have a role or duty ("something you're supposed to do"). The two painful responses are: 1) Going along with it and feeling dissatisfied, or 2) Rebelling against it and feeling guilty. Both are suffering (Dukkha).

**2. The Woeful States (Buddhist Framework)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:** References the "four woeful states" from Buddhism (hungry ghost, hell, animal, frightened asura). He specifically links the feeling of being stuck in goal-driven or rebellious cycles to being reborn "as an animal in that moment"—meaning a beast of burden.
*   **Purpose:** To frame the listener's personal struggle within a universal, traditional context, showing it's a common human trap, not a unique personal failing.

**3. The Ferris Wheel**
*   **Metaphor:** The cyclical pattern of thought (goal -> suffering, no goal -> depression) is compared to riding a Ferris wheel.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize the repetitive, monotonous, and ultimately unenjoyable nature of these mental cycles. You see the same views (the seats) over and over but don't enjoy the ride.

**4. The Key to the Universe (Guru Joke)**
*   **Story:** A seeker climbs a mountain to ask an old guru, "What is the key to the universe?" The guru replies, **"I didn't know the universe was locked."**
*   **Purpose:** This is a central metaphor. The search for "the meaning of life" is like looking for a key to a lock that doesn't exist. The universe isn't locked; it's open and accessible. The problem is our mistaken belief that we need a special key (a grand purpose, meaning, or answer) to access happiness.

**5. Quicksand**
*   **Metaphor:** Getting stuck in a bad mood or negative thought cycle is like being stuck in quicksand.
*   **Mechanics & Purpose:** The instinctual reaction—to struggle and try to "pull yourself out" (by thinking harder, analyzing, fighting the feeling)—only sinks you deeper. The **correct method** is to "lay down, relax, and take a deep breath." This directly parallels the meditation advice: to stop struggling with thoughts, relax, and focus on the breath (Anapanasati) to naturally rise out of the mental quicksand.

**6. Striptease / Breadcrumb Trail**
*   **Metaphor:** The cycle of wanting (dopamine-driven craving) is compared to a striptease or a trail of breadcrumbs used to trap an animal.
*   **Purpose:** To show how desire teases and leads us on, promising a payoff that either never comes or is ultimately a trap. It highlights the addictive and unsatisfying nature of craving versus the genuine satisfaction (serotonin) of contentment.

**7. The Blackboard / Whiteboard**
*   **Metaphor:** The meaning we assign to life is like writing on a blackboard (or whiteboard).
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate that meaning is not inherent; it's something we actively write. The crucial point is that **it can be erased and rewritten.** We have the power to change the meaning we assign to any moment, and we don't have to cling to any particular story.

**8. Dopamine vs. Serotonin (Modern Scientific Metaphor)**
*   **Metaphor:** The speaker adopts the listener's scientific frame: dopamine represents the craving, chasing, "wanting" mode. Serotonin represents the satisfied, content, "liking" mode.
*   **Purpose:** To map the ancient teaching (tanha/craving vs. contentment) onto modern neurochemistry, making it relatable. The practice is framed as moving from a "dopamine world" of endless wanting to a "serotonin world" of present-moment satisfaction.

**9. The Six Points of the Compass (Making it Real)**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** He re-interprets the traditional Buddhist meditation of radiating loving-kindness in the six directions (north, south, east, west, up, down).
*   **Purpose:** To shift from a **conceptualized, romanticized world** (the abstract "universe") to the **real world of the senses**. The "six directions" become the real people in your life: those in front of you, behind you, above you (mentors), below you (those who serve), and beside you (family and friends). The metaphor argues for grounding yourself in your immediate, sensory reality instead of getting lost in abstract, existential thoughts.

**Core Function of the Metaphors:**
Collectively, these metaphors and stories serve to:
*   **Normalize** the listener's experience (you're not alone, this is a common "animal" trap).
*   **Depersonalize** the struggle (it's a pattern of the mind, not your core identity).
*   **Illustrate the trap** vividly (Ferris wheel, quicksand, draft animal).
*   **Undermine the search for grand meaning** (the key joke, the blackboard).
*   **Provide a practical "way out"** (quicksand method, focusing on the senses/compass).
*   **Reframe attitude** from a victim searching for meaning to a champion appreciating what is already present and unlocked.
