### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Geshe-la, if you can understand me.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're asking about the Western view of the— or actually the Western Buddhism is much closer to Hindu than in fact a lot of Westerners, they just see Asian religions as Asian religions. And they can't tell the difference. And sometimes the agents can't tell the difference either. And the other way of going with these rules is that if you have two levels or two standards of rules, then somehow it must be safer to hold the higher standard. And I'll give you an example of that, is that that having a whole lot of women is not a very high standard. Having only 4 is a higher standard. Having only 1 woman is a higher standard. And then having no women at all is a higher standard. Okay, okay. And so just because a monk or a priest does not have a wife, that will hold him automatically to a higher standard. All right, now the question that you're actually asking is about killing, uh, existing beings or breathing beings. And, uh, the question is, is that what standard do you think is appropriate for yourself?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because not killing anything, that's always Pardon, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, I said not killing anything at all, like flies and ants, when you live in a house, is very difficult.

**Speaker B:** Well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Have you ever had a cold or COVID?

**Speaker A:** Yes, not long ago.

**Speaker B:** Yes, okay. Okay, and you got cured of that, right?

**Speaker A:** Oh yes.

**Speaker B:** So you killed that, so you're already doing a mass murder job.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, billions.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right. Do you drink filtered water?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** What kind of water do you drink? Water straight out of the river?

**Speaker A:** No, like tap water mostly.

**Speaker B:** Panna?

**Speaker A:** Tap water from the sink.

**Speaker B:** Tap water, okay. Which goes through a filtration system by the city.

**Speaker A:** I think so, yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So on your behalf, they do a whole lot of murdering just so you can have a drink of water. And even when they— you get that drink of water, it's still not absolutely pure, and that you are going to be killing a few things in there. Yes, already. Okay, so the question now is size. Because I've gone right to the other extreme of how small, because the smaller these things are, the less likely you are going to be free from killing, if we want to define the word killing that way. Okay, but the question that you're asking about is, well, what about things just a little bit bigger than that? By calling insects, OK? And you might, in fact, understand the story that the Buddha taught, that has a whole lot to do with, and in fact, this was something that was happening on a wide basis, where humanity in its very early days of religion, would do human sacrifice. And it was done worldwide. And then they started substituting the animals for that sacrifice. And then the next phase was calling an end to animal sacrifice, and that's where the time of the Buddha— it was also the time of Jeremiah in the Old Testament, known as the weeping prophet, which was wailing about the execution of the innocents. The lambs and the birds and all of that that people would trap and drag into the temple just so they could be murdered over words.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Now there is an actual story about the Buddha, and that actual story is about the time when he was sitting in meditation on, uh, the top of the hill in an area, and he noticed that the, uh, the sheepherd and the goat herders were herding their sheep up at the wrong time of the day. That they were bringing them back early in the day, rather than leaving the sheep out for pasture all day long. Knowing that something was strange, he went down to question, and while that was happening, he noticed that one of the keepers was having trouble getting a lamb rescued, because it had gotten his foot caught, because they were really driving them fast. Uh, and so the Buddha picked up this lamb then and carried it. And this is the, uh, the image of the Buddha carrying the lamb that I think got mixed up with Christianity, with Jesus carrying one too. But Jesus— but Buddha was the first one to carry a lamb. Now, where did he carry this lamb to? Was to the king, because the king had ordered— because the Brahmins wanted it, the king had ordered a mass sacrifice. Immediately, because something bad had happened. I don't even remember what. And so the Brahmana says, "Oh, you've got to go make a great big sacrifice so that we have plenty of meat for the next 30 days or so," at the expense of all of the villagers' cattle. And this was actually, I think this is Sutta No. 52 in the Majjhima Nikaya, this story, where the Buddha then convinces this king in a very kind of strange way that killing animals is not going to cause us to gain good fortunes out of bad. Okay, then in fact this was done on a regular basis of animal sacrifices, chickens getting slaughtered so that the gizzards could be inspected, and all kinds of other shenanigans were were pulled by the charlatans at the expense of living animals. And so, this is what the Buddha was against, and this is what paññatipāta actually means in the Pali. And the whole precept is paññatipāta vairāminī sukkhāvadham samadhi ��nī, and that is, that we will mindfully refrain, we will take that as a training Thus one trains oneself to not kill animals, especially if there's no reason to. Now, this was there, by the way. There was already the Jains that were in India at the time. He was already associated with them, and they were some of the first vegetarians, and they didn't want any animals killed. They even got so bad that they would wear a face cloth to keep the animals from getting in their mouths, and they would carry a little broom around and they would sweep the path in front of them, lest they step on something. This is how deeply they got into that non-killing. And so, they asked the Buddha about, well, what is his problem about, because he eats meat? And he says, "No, I don't eat meat, I eat food." In fact, that was pulled on Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in Thailand. Quite a number of years ago, for the vegetarians that come in and say, "Well, why are you eating meat?" And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa answered, "I don't eat meat, I eat food I'm given. It was presented as food, and I eat food. You're the one who is making a connection of a connection of a connection of a connection, way back in a chain of dominoes." So who are you going to blame? The guy who intentionally got that calf to be born, or the one who raised the calf knowing that it was going to get slaughtered? In fact, the guy who raised the calf is going to get most of the money, or at least quite a lot of money, out of taking it. The butcher who's going to slaughter him is only getting a small fee because his job is done in a minute or two. Okay, and then the butcher is going to cut up the meat. Is the butcher responsible for killing the cow if it's a different butcher that actually cut up the meat? And then what about the delivery people that are delivering the meat? Are they responsible for the killing of that cow? And then how about— and you hear it going on and on and on. But when it comes to the farmer has to give his cow because the king demands it and the Brahmins demanded that they take that cow and they to kill it for some useless reason. That's what the Buddha was against. Okay, that, and that is often missed because we would, rather than find that really, really beautiful balance, that fine line, that middle path, we often will go to an extreme because at least we know what the extreme side is. Here you've run right into that brick wall. In fact, you've been butting your head against a really extreme, and I just pointed out to you that no, you didn't go extreme enough. If you go to the absolute limit of no killing, you're going to die. You can't survive without killing. In fact, you're probably doing a mass genocide every breath you take.

**Speaker A:** Probably, yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so we need to find a balance in there for you. And that's what I would recommend that you do, is that you find some balance for yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's what I've tried. So if there's an insect in my house, then I mean, I have to get rid of it because they multiply.

**Speaker B:** And it becomes impossible.

**Speaker A:** Outside, I just leave them be. They're not my problem. They don't really come in my way, so I leave the Anicca fly.

**Speaker B:** They are in your problem. If it's termites, they'll eat your floor, and when you put— when you lose your foot through the floor, then it's your problem. Knowing that, before you break through the floor, you know that termites are a problem that need to be fixed. That in fact, in many places in the world, they, uh, when you sell the house, you have to give them a paper proving that the house is termite-free.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's part of the business of the upkeep of the house. And if it's your house, that means that that house depends upon you. You're the owner. You're the one who's responsible for keeping that place up. Even through the means of a small battle or skirmish or two, with the animals that think it belongs to them.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's what I thought. I thought it was hypocritical, because if I don't kill the flies, then my kids will do it, or my wife. At the end of the day, the flies will get killed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but if they do it, then it's not your problem, is it? In fact, you could go to the store and give them the, give them the, uh, the can of Ray and hand it to them and says, okay, it's not my problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've done that a few times.

**Speaker B:** All right, so that's an easy solution. It's not your problem. Where in that chain of killing are you going to, uh, be comfortable with knowing that you're in that chain of killing no matter what?

**Speaker A:** I am. I have to train.

**Speaker B:** This is the exact point that I recommend for many students about politics. Look how many people in the world hate those cockroaches called the other party, or the other party called cockroaches. Sorry, got that backwards, but you know what I mean. All right, and so if there are so many people who hate them and see them as cockroaches, let them go deal with them as cockroaches, and you don't have to. So if you see the, the little animals in your house as cockroaches and you don't like them, then you can give the Anagami gas or poison or whatever to someone who does want to go deal with cockroaches. That's their business, not yours. The question for you is, can you do this with a clean mind, with a clean heart?

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** A good example of that would be that if I take the ticks off the dog and throw them in the yard, the ticks will just crawl right back on the dogs. And right here in the tropics, we've got a couple of dogs. In fact, we got a new puppy. We got 3 dogs now. And if we don't do something about ticks every day, they will begin to harm the dogs. And not only that, but they'll get all over the house. So we've got it a tick problem. And so we, uh, put, um, uh, ointments, knowing that those ointments will kill the ticks. We also, when we take the ticks off the dog, we'll put them in a bottle, knowing that those ticks will never come out of that bottle, intentionally so.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I mean, why? You have to, because I'm protecting the dogs. I care more about the dogs than I do the ticks, but I'm doing this wisely, not because there's some rule in the sky that some fancy Kamma machine is keeping track of. Yeah, right, because there's no Kamma machine in the sky keeping track of what you're doing. You're doing that. That's your job.

**Speaker A:** Right, yes, no magical.

**Speaker B:** Nothing magical in there.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Now the other point is, is that you've got things kind of upside down in the way that the Buddha looks at it, and ordinary people with all of the other religions. And in fact, this is what builds society, is that we take a given set of rules and apply it to the children, and when the children buy into those rules, no matter how they do it, now we consider them socialized. And if the kids don't follow the rules, they're little barbarians and they need to be punished, or they're cockroaches or something like that. But if they learn to follow the rules, now they're okay kids. When those kids grow up, they become kind of confused about these rules, because when they begin to inspect them, they recognize that this was done in kind of a blanket way, that in fact you can't make a rule to fit reality. It's just too darn complex. And when governments and legislatures try to, they eventually will put in loopholes. The crooks will always find a way of sneaking out under whatever laws are laid down. And oftentimes the laws are laid down in a way that traps people that don't need to be trapped, which sounds like where you are. You've been trapped by a rule that didn't apply to you in the first place.

**Speaker A:** I mean, that's good to know.

**Speaker B:** All right, so the next point then is to recognize that the Buddha was not into laying down rules to ignorant people. That's what religions do. The whole teaching of the Buddha was to wake up. And then in fact, the precepts that are known as Buddhist precepts, including the— not just the Panna Tapata, but the Attenadana and the Kamma Summichachchara and the Musavada and the Srotapanna and Machapammatadana, all of those things are examples of someone who has a mind that is pure and free. So if you get your mind in the state of pure and free, then you're unlikely to kill anything. But in fact, you could get it going this far, that let us say that the Rabbi who was responsible for killing the animals that had to do with the sacrifices in the Jewish religion. One time he's about to use that knife and he looks in that goat's face and that goat talks to him somehow or another, and he says, I can't do this anymore, I can't do this anymore. And he sets that knife down and he walks away. Now, in that moment, we don't know what he's going to do next goat, but we do know that in this goat, his mind was pure enough to see compassion for the goat rather than doing what he was told to do. That's the big difference here. So, um, in regard to the Eightfold Noble Path, that the— in fact, the right actions that we're talking about, plus right speech and right livelihood, come out of the Eightfold Noble Path. But the way that the Buddha introduces the Eightfold Noble Path is important, because in the sutta he says, "Oh monks, listen, and I will teach you about right organization of mind, right unification of mind, with its supports and features." And then we go off into the supports, which we began to talk about a little bit. And the supports are like Sati, to wake up, to investigate, to take the right view of seeing what is, and then making a change, and then getting the success out of that change. So those are the four that bring that mind together, unification. What are now the features of that unified mind? Now that you've seen the supports bring it together, what are the features? If you don't want anything, you're unlikely to kill to get it. If you don't want anything, you're unlikely to steal to get it. If you don't want anything, it's unlikely to go mess with her to get it, even if she's somebody else's girlfriend. You're unlikely to go lie to somebody to get it if you don't want it. You don't want it.

**Speaker A:** That's radical.

**Speaker B:** Radical solution, right? And if your mind is already pure and clear, there's no reason to go get drunk, because what good is that going to do? You like the mind, state of mind that you have right now better. Most of the reasons why people drink is either one, they're supposed to because that's what their group and place in society and all this. Or number 2, I feel so bad that maybe the alcohol will make me feel better.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but I feel great, so I don't need it.

**Speaker B:** So if I feel great, then I don't need it, so I don't need a rule about it. Yeah, because I don't need it. That's the whole point then, is that when we begin to see things through wisdom then we recognize that I have no intention of killing, but I do have an intention of taking the ticks off the dog to make the dog more healthy. Because I have seen dogs actually get sick and die because they were drained. Yeah, living in Asia, that happens. And so I'm always a friend of the dogs, and that's, that's my style. I'm not so much friend of the ticks.

**Speaker A:** Anagami neither.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so in that regard, the intention is not to harm the ticks, the intention is to heal the dog.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And I care not about what Kamma machine that takes care of ticks has on me.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I mean, so it's the same in my house, my intention is to protect and clean my house, basically.

**Speaker B:** Precisely, that's your intention.

**Speaker A:** I mean, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, your intent— you don't have the intention to kill the animal for the wrong reasons.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** That even, in fact, if you trapped— if you were a hunter because that was your livelihood and you trapped a rabbit and and killed it and ate it, I could not see anything about with that either, because the intention is merely to eat, which was in fact much of the intention along the way. That's why I asked you the question, and the answer is you can't really tell along the way of the life of that calf who exactly is the most responsible for the killing of it. So what's a Kamma machine to do with complexity like that? I mean, that Kamma machine's got to be much more sophisticated and intellectually capable than a human being, and that's why they invent gods. They need a god to make those kind of decisions. And guess what? Any god that I know that's good enough to know how to do that is also smart enough to not give a flying rip about it. Yeah, probably. And so we can really then look at what was the original point of this. And the answer to that is, is that let's get the mind cleaned up. That's the point of it. Because if you can see the dangers and the damage and what you're about to do, you're not going to do it. And if you can see the dangers in advance, then you're nowhere near it. And so that was the story then of going for the Buddha to go to King Pasenadi. In fact, we know the name of the king, and we know it's a suit— I forget why, but it's in there. And the Buddha talked him out of it with this kind of talk, that it has to do with your mind and it does not have to do with changing your fortune or your good luck, because these Brahmins want to kill all the stock in the county.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, again, this is magical thinking.

**Speaker B:** Magical thinking, precisely.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And it's still done.

**Speaker A:** I know. And yeah, all over the place.

**Speaker B:** All over the world. It's done in Mexico, it's done in South Carolina, it's done in Indonesia, it's done in Thailand. I mean, there's still some craziness, especially with chickens. They seem to have gotten on to chickens in this particular century.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not enough to eat them.

**Speaker B:** You have to sacrifice them, right? And, and, um, actually it's a big show. It's entertainment. Well, that's the greater part of it, is the entertaining quality to it for people who need that kind of entertainment.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And so when we recognize that there are really good, unwholesome reasons to kill, and that that's what the Buddha was pointing out, that let's not have unwholesome reasons for killing, let's have only wholesome reasons. And if your mind is really pure and clear, you're not going to be killing because the state of mind that you're in— never mind who wrote what rules that are in some book.

**Speaker A:** Right? Yes. Um, I think I have another question that's related to the topic, um, because I know that you mentioned that for you Rebirth is magical thinking? If you see what I mean.

**Speaker B:** Well, it depends.

**Speaker A:** Right, because this is one of the.

**Speaker B:** Things.

**Speaker A:** I'm confused about. Because to me, I think to some extent, if you are 100% sure that there is nothing after death, that there is no rebirth?

**Speaker B:** Why should I be 100% sure about someplace that I've never been? I'm not even 100% sure of the things that I know for sure exist. Okay, no, I have never said that. In fact, what I will tell the students is that after death, who knows? Nobody has come back. Okay, we have no evidence. But whatever is beyond your own death, be ready for that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** But don't count on anything because we don't know anything. And yet much of humanity really counts on what's happening after death. I mean, look at the entire funeral industry in the United States is really counting on that that casket means something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a big budget, yes.

**Speaker B:** And when you recognize that what happens after your death right now don't mean a thing, that what means something right now is how can you handle the things that are reborn right in front of you, like bad feelings that keep getting reborn over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, distracting thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and this thought about this rule about not killing you've had on your mind, and there it has been over and over and on your nose again, clawing at you, right? Uh-huh, right. That's rebirth.

**Speaker A:** Yes, enough to call you.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, pardon?

**Speaker A:** I said it was on my mind enough for me to call you and ask you a question. So it has been.

**Speaker B:** Now, yes, right, it's on your mind, it's gnawing at you. And what that really means, if you contain, uh, the Is it that that thought happens, and then it happens again, and then it's born again, and then it's born again, and you begin to see that it's again, and here it is again, and the only way to resolve that is by calling Dhammarato, but anywhere, it's still there again, it's reborn, and reborn, and reborn. This is the teaching of the Buddha about rebirth. That's why it's called rebirth, not reincarnation. That there is a major distinction between rebirth and reincarnation. And the magical version of rebirth actually is a step in the right direction. It's almost like a set of stairs. Way high up here is belief in rebirth and heaven and hell no matter what. Okay, and then we come down a level to the next level is rebirth, because at the level of rebirth, yes, we do admit that things keep rolling on. Cause and effect is still rolling on, but if there is no self in this life, then there is no self in that next life. That whoever it is that's reborn is not you, because whatever is reborn tomorrow morning is not you. So if you can take care of it at that level, that whoever it is is reborn is not you, now we can come down to the level of it. I don't give a flying rip.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I'm trying to cultivate that attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So the things that we don't know don't bother us. The things that bother us are not the things that we don't know, it's the lies we've been told about what what we think is existing when in fact there's no evidence of it. So when the Christians ask, well, what will you do when you get placed into the front of God on Judgment Day? And I'll say, well, one thing, I'll take up as much time as I can since the day is going to be a long one. And number two, I'm going to start pointing out some of the mistakes that he's made like snakes with venom and crocodiles and, uh, termites and common cold and a lot of that kind of stuff. And when I get them thoroughly confused and disgusted with me, then I'll take Jesus, we'll go out for a beer. Now that's what I want to do.

**Speaker A:** That's the attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right. And not only that, but the way that I got to, um, Heaven was in first class. You see, all the Christians, they're back in what you'd call a comedy class, because they got on the jet plane to Heaven because of mercy and generosity. They're in fact, they're freeloaders and free riders. Yeah, but I'm up there in first class because I paid for my ticket.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's the right attitude to have.

**Speaker B:** That's it. So it doesn't really matter what happens. I don't care. Whatever happens, I can handle that now. I can handle that now-ness then. Whenever it happens, it will be a now. Yes, I can handle this now. I can handle that one.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's also what I'm trying to cultivate.

**Speaker B:** Because that's exactly what we mean by enlightenment, if you would, is that you're light enough that you don't take anything seriously. They say, in fact, that angels can fly because they take themselves so lightly. Yeah, that's an interesting idea in English about lighten up, to just lighten up. That in fact what happens when, when we hear things like thou shalt not kill, that's good. That's because killing is something that's really, really heavy. But then the rule about it becomes really, really heavy too. Yeah, we tighten up about the rules, set down both the action, the bad action, and the bad attitude about the bad action. Just set both of them down, and now you're light. You don't have to carry either the rule to don't do it or the act of doing it. You're free from both of them now.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, yeah, that's good. Unfortunately, Dhammarato, I'm going to have to go because my daughter— Well, this has.

**Speaker B:** Been a delightful talk. I really enjoyed this.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, me too. And you've definitely helped me a lot, so thank you very much. I will call you back in a few days. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it would be good to see you again.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yes, have a good day. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is:

**Speaker B (Dhammarato) guides Speaker A away from a rigid, literal interpretation of the precept against killing ("paññatipāta") and toward a wise, intentional, and balanced "Middle Path" approach.**

Here are the key points of the discussion:

1.  **The Impossibility of Absolute Non-Killing:** Dhammarato immediately reframes the issue by pointing out that absolute non-killing is impossible for a living being. We kill microorganisms when we get sick, drink filtered water, or even breathe. The question is not about achieving purity from all killing, but about finding a wise and balanced relationship with it.

2.  **Historical & Intentional Context of the Precept:** The precept was primarily taught in the context of **stopping ritual animal sacrifice** (a common practice in the Buddha's time) and preventing killing for **"unwholesome reasons"**—like superstition, entertainment, or greed. The Buddha's famous story of saving the lamb was an intervention against a mass sacrifice ordered by Brahmins.

3.  **The Pitfall of "Magical Thinking" & Rigid Rules:** The talk warns against turning the precept into a magical rule where karma is a cosmic scorecard. This leads to guilt, confusion, and "butting your head against a brick wall." Society socializes us with blanket rules, but reality is too complex for rigid laws to fit perfectly.

4.  **The Solution is Wisdom and Intention, Not Rule-Following:** The true Buddhist path is about **awakening the mind**, not blindly following rules. When the mind is pure, clear, and free from craving, unwholesome actions naturally cease.
    *   **The "Radical Solution":** If you don't *want* anything (due to a content mind), you are unlikely to kill, steal, or lie to get it. The precepts describe the natural behavior of a purified mind.
    *   **Weighing Intentions:** One must wisely discern intention. The intention to protect your home from termites or your dog from disease-ticking ticks is different from the intention to kill for sport or ritual. The key is to act with a "clean mind" and a compassionate primary intention (e.g., "heal the dog," "protect the household").

5.  **Practical Advice for Daily Life:** Dhammarato offers pragmatic advice:
    *   You can delegate tasks like pest control to others if it troubles your conscience. The mental burden is yours to manage.
    *   Find a personal balance that is workable and free from guilt, recognizing that complete non-violence is not viable.

6.  **Connection to Rebirth & The Present Moment:** In the final part, Dhammarato connects this to the concept of **rebirth**. He emphasizes the psychological, moment-to-moment rebirth of **distressing thoughts** (like the nagging guilt over this rule) as the more immediate concern than metaphysical rebirth after death. The goal is to be "light" and able to handle whatever arises in the **present moment** ("now-ness"), which is the essence of enlightenment.

**In essence, the talk moves the focus from external compliance with a rule to internal cultivation of wisdom and intention. The path is about lightening the mental burden of dogma, seeing reality clearly, and acting from a place of compassionate discernment rather than fear or magical thinking.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, identified as Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate his points about Buddhist ethics, rules, and the precept against killing:

### **Key Metaphors:**
1.  **The "Kamma Machine" / "Fancy Kamma Machine in the Sky":**
    *   Used repeatedly to critique a superstitious, legalistic, or mechanistic view of karma. He argues there is no external cosmic scorekeeper tallying deeds; the responsibility and consequences are about one's own mind and intention.

2.  **The "Chain of Dominoes" or "Chain of Killing":**
    *   Used to deconstruct the complexity of blame in actions like eating meat. He asks who in the long chain (farmer, butcher, transporter, cook, eater) is truly "responsible" for the killing, arguing that simplistic rules can't capture this reality.

3.  **"Lightening Up" / "Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly":**
    *   A metaphor for enlightenment and wise attitude. The problem isn't just the heavy action (killing), but also the heavy, rigid attachment to the *rule* against it. Freedom comes from letting go of both.

4.  **"Brick Wall" / "Butting your head against an extreme":**
    *   Describes the futility and suffering of applying an absolutist rule (like "never kill anything") to a complex world, where it's impossible to live up to.

5.  **"Fine Line" / "Beautiful Balance" / "Middle Path":**
    *   The core Buddhist metaphor presented as the alternative to extremes. It's about finding a wise, context-sensitive balance rather than clinging to rigid absolutes.

6.  **"Cockroaches" (in politics):**
    *   Used to illustrate how we dehumanize opponents ("the other party"). He extends it to pests, suggesting you can let someone else deal with a problem you view as "cockroaches" without making it your own karmic burden.

7.  **"First Class vs. Comedy Class" on the plane to Heaven:**
    *   A humorous, provocative metaphor to contrast his self-reliant, wisdom-based path (first class, paid ticket) with a faith-based path he sees as relying on mercy and dogma (comedy class, freeloaders).

### **Key Stories and Historical Examples:**
1.  **The Buddha and the Lamb (from the Majjhima Nikaya):**
    *   The central story. The Buddha intervenes to stop a mass animal sacrifice ordered by a king on the advice of Brahmins. He carries a lamb to the king and argues that killing animals for ritual or to change fortune is wrong and ineffective. This story defines the precept's original intent: opposing **ritual sacrifice and unnecessary killing**, not an absolute prohibition.

2.  **The Rabbi and the Goat:**
    *   A story about a Jewish ritual slaughterer who looks into a goat's eyes, feels compassion, and sets down his knife. This illustrates the "pure mind" principle—when the mind is clear and compassionate, unwholesome actions cease naturally, regardless of rules or social duty.

3.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and "I eat food":**
    *   The Thai monk's response to vegetarians criticizing him for eating meat. He says, "I don't eat meat, I eat food I'm given." This story highlights the importance of **intention** and perception over the material substance itself, breaking the chain of obsessive attribution of blame.

4.  **Historical Context of Animal Sacrifice:**
    *   He provides a narrative of religious evolution: human sacrifice → animal sacrifice → movements to end animal sacrifice (contemporaneous with the Buddha and the prophet Jeremiah). This frames the Buddha's teaching as part of a historical ethical advancement.

5.  **The Jains:**
    *   Referenced as an example of the "extreme" of non-violence (*ahimsa*), wearing face cloths and sweeping paths to avoid harming insects. This serves as a contrast to the Buddha's "Middle Path."

6.  **Personal Anecdote - Ticks on Dogs:**
    *   He uses his own practice of removing and killing ticks to protect his dogs. This concrete example illustrates "wholesome reason" vs. "unwholesome reason." The intention is to heal/protect the dog, not to harm the tick out of malice. This is presented as a responsible, compassionate balance.

### **Overall Narrative Metaphor:**
The entire talk constructs a **journey from legalism to wisdom**. The listener starts trapped by a rigid, "magical" rule ("thou shalt not kill"). Through stories and metaphors, the guide shows the impossibility and unhappiness of that extreme, reveals its historical misunderstanding, and redirects the focus to **purifying the mind, examining intention, and finding a compassionate, balanced response to life's complex demands.** The goal is not perfect compliance but a light, free, and responsible mind.
