### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hello folks, today is, what is it, February 7th, and that today we'll be talking about what it is like for the mind to be noble, and that that is carefully phrased to make sure that we're leaving the word being out, because the word being has the quality— like a human being or whatever— has the quality of a self. And the quality of the mind of a noble is that there is no self. Another quality of the mind. In fact, this is an important point, and that is, where does one find pleasure? And that ordinary people throughout all the ages and throughout all of the societies, we teach our children to gain pleasure through the senses. We want to hear nice things said about us. We don't like when people argue with us. We have favorite drawings and paintings and things that we like. In fact, that's the whole quality of a museum, is to go and look at things that you like to see. Great numbers of people are in research looking at things that they'd like to see. Now we have all of these video, uh, AI things and YouTube, all of it around taking pleasure in seeing things. Also, music is, uh, designed around taking pleasure in hearing things. And look at how much effort is put into fine cuisine and cooking and various ingredients, numbers of ingredients, because we take pleasure in taste. And then we have massage and medical science, and— well, not medical science— going to the gym and all kinds of things, because people take pleasure in the body, as well as then going and looking at the body in a mirror and taking pleasure in the mirror. Now Because of this, many, many people throughout the world have heard this, and then they say, well, that means that the Buddha does not advertise or teach to take pleasure. To where that's not true at all. In fact, the Buddha teaches that pleasure is the reason for Dukkha. What do I mean by that? It's that if we were not seeking pleasure, then we would not be finding no pleasure that we were looking for. In other words, wanting something that we don't have is the primary issue of Dukkha. And so when the mind is free from Dukkha, that does not at all mean that the mind is free from pleasure. But rather that the mind can generate the pleasure on the inside, because there are not 5 senses, there are 6. There are the 5 outside senses, and then there is the 6th sense. This actually brings up a kind of contradiction or a duality with the word consciousness, because there is actually two kinds of consciousness. One would be consciousness of the outside five senses, and then there is another consciousness which is conscious of the internal mind sense. Now, one of the things about the, um, the sixth sense base is, is that the mind space uses as its stored feature the external senses. So you could say that the mind then can only see in the mind state what can be seen in the outside world. Well, that's kind of true, but we can make up. But the making up is actually combining things that we have seen. To make stuff up means that we're reconfiguring and redesigning things that we actually have seen. And this would be creativity, poem writing, and all kinds of things. But even if a poem has a made-up word, the made-up word is made up of other words that the poet already knows. And this is an important point then, that the mind then kind of mirrors— maybe it's a distorted mirror, but it mirrors the other five senses. And that if we pay more attention to the mind sense, then we will be better off because it's more— I have the ability to control that. In other words, you can go to a fine restaurant and be disappointed because the restaurant's closed. Or you can be even more disappointed by going to that fine restaurant and find out that it's closed down or sold. So we can think of things or bring something into the mind state, and we have then a choice about whether we're going to— how we're going to feel about that. So our feelings then are dependent in the ordinary world on the external five senses, and if we want something for our senses and we don't get it, then we're dissatisfied. Well, that same pattern then holds that we can think of something that's generally associated with the outside world, We can have a mind state and then it is also dissatisfied. But that's partly due to bad training. We don't have the skill. And so the real skill then is to keep the mind in a wholesome state, including pleasure. The Buddha, in fact, at one time says that he will take pleasure wherever it may be found in the context of it being wholesome, which means mental. So this is the foundation for the noble mind. The noble mind is the mind that can choose to take pleasure or not. Totally within the mind, where all the ordinary people are doing it through the five senses. And then there is the path, which means that some people are practicing to have a noble mind, and sometimes they're good at it and sometimes they're not. Sometimes they are practicing well and sometimes they're not. But the more one practices having a mind in a noble state, then the skills will build from that position. And if we are not practicing well, then even if we have practiced well, by not continuing to practice,, we will go back to trying to find pleasure in the five senses, as opposed to finding pleasure in the mind sense. So this is basically a way of looking at when the mind is noble, that means that the mind is engaged with what's happening within the mind. And when the mind is not noble, it's engaged with what's on the outside. An example then of that is, well, what is compassion, Gigi? What is compassion is when the mind is compassion. When the mind is compassion, we have compassion for the inside. Now, The funny part is that many people, or most people, whenever they begin to practice, when they find themselves— when they want to practice but they're not practicing, they've forgotten to practice or whatever— they're not then bringing up compassion for themselves. They become hard on themselves instead. They become critical. But if you can maintain compassion on the inside, no matter what wrongdoing or bad doing that has just occurred, that in fact, if we are critical of that wrongdoing, it's much more likely that we'll repeat that wrongdoing. But if we are compassionate for that wrongdoing, then the wrongdoing will subside. What I'm saying in that regard, within the mind, the carrot is better than the stick. And yet many people use the stick on themselves. Probably the best example in our society is what we call work or the job. We're holding a job because of social conditions. One of the social conditions is, you don't work, you don't eat. Other social conditions would be the hierarchy of employers versus employees, etc., like that. And we are trained from first grade, from very early education systems, to do what we are told to do right now, rather than doing what we want to do. Now, they have experimented with schools that were different than that, where the child decided what he wanted to do, and he enjoyed doing that. But most traditional education is that the child must do what he is told to do And the child does what he's told to do, but he doesn't like it. And so we're grown up, and now we go around doing a lot of stuff, but the mind is in a state of dissatisfaction. Even though we're doing the job, we in fact, we want to be congratulated for doing a good job, but while we're doing the job, we don't like it. Maybe we're anticipating that I'll get congratulated if I do the job, but we're not actually enjoying the job. So what that actually breaks down to is that it's better to get the mind in a happy, joyful state right now and then do the job. Someone recently asked what happens on the job if you feel tension. The answer is leave the job. You don't have to leave your desk, you don't have to walk out of the building, but leave the job and get your mind free from tension right then and there. And then when the mind is free from tension free from anxiety, free from not wanting to do the work. When the mind is then free, we can do the work happily. This is then the distinction between the noble mind and the ordinary mind. Now what happens is that over time When we spend more and more time with the mind in a noble state, we see less and less unhappy things to do. An example would be the Pope. I have seen videos of the Pope going to the Grand Opera, and as the Pope is entering the Grand Opera, going into his oversized box seat with all of his cardinal friends and attendants, and even the conductor will turn around and everybody will applaud the fact that the Pope is there. But then, after the Pope has recognized the attention, guess what? The conductor and the orchestra and the staff that's doing the show, all of the singers, actors, and all of the stagehands or whatever, now become the point. And the Pope is no longer the issue. The Pope is forgotten about. While the show goes on. Now, the Buddha would say therefore that the Pope, or if we can take the word Pope out of it and start using the word Bhikkhu, the Bhikkhu doesn't go to these shows because the show itself is actually entertainment that comes from the outside of the mind. To find pleasure in the music, to find pleasure in the dancing on stage, to find pleasure in the Shakespearean jokes and whatnot like that. And yet, there's a lot of stuff that happens that's worthy of criticism that happens on stage. And so, this is why there is a precept: Nacha Gita Vatadabi Sukkhasana Wei Ramani Sagabadhamma Samadhi Vami. That word visukkha-dasana means finding pleasure in the outside world and becoming a slave to it. This is what entertainment then is, is that we're looking for joy in the entertainment, to where the Bhikkhu is going to be just fine finding joy inside his own mind. He doesn't need the entertainment. So this is, um, uh, the way that we're beginning to understand that it's a process of coming out of sensual pleasure and coming into the mind which is, uh, capable of finding all the pleasure that we need. It's right there in the inside of the mind, but it must be practiced because very few of us have ever gotten pleasure from inside the mind. We're not taught that. Even mathematicians, scientists, Einsteins, etc., like that, they do thought experiments because they're trying to solve a problem that they invented themselves, rather than taking pleasure. In fact, Einstein and Niels Bohr got into several arguments over a long number of years, even after Einstein had done most of his important research. The inventions of the mind, the inventors, don't always take pleasure. Another example is Edison, Thomas Edison, who has been more or less given credit for the electric light bulb, where the idea of a light bulb by putting a current in a filament that lights up. And the important point is getting the light, not the heat, out of it was something that was an idea that predated Edison. But he and his staff worked for years trying to perfect it. They wound up in the late 1880s of having a tungsten or a tungsten carbide filament in an argon gas, because the argon is a noble gas, which means— and that's an important point, I like that word noble in the sense of noble elements. Why? Because they don't mate, they don't mix, they don't care about this filament. Now, if you've got a normal atmosphere that's got oxygen and nitrogen in it, that filament is going to get burned up because the oxygen says, hot dog, I've got a meal here. And these— and the oxygen is going to then destroy the tungsten or tungsten carbide filament. However, a noble gas, he doesn't care. So this is another way of experiencing what is a noble, is one who is unconcerned with the outside world, unconcerned. Now, the point was, is that Edison says that invention, like invention of the light bulb, was 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. What he meant was, is that while he was trying to develop and get that light bulb going, he went through a whole lot of Dukkha. Dukkha, dukkha, dukkha in every experiment that failed. It didn't work. But now, let us say in the past 50 years, we've come to say, thank you very much, Mr. Edison, for your incandescent light bulb, but we find it unfulfilling. It's not good enough. It's still Dukkha-laden. And since then, we've come up with halogen and mercury lamps and fluorescents and now LEDs. Look how much they've been inventing and inventing and inventing, because what Edison gave us was still not good enough. This is what the scientists have always done, is they have gone in and tried to recombine things that they know about in order to come up with something new. And they almost always go through a great deal of Dukkha to get there. To where the Noble Dhamma is, is that no, you can get right to that pleasurable mind Immediately. That's one of the most important qualities of the teaching of the Buddha, is that it's not a gradual path. And yet you will see gradual path in much of Buddhism. You'll see gradual path in Christianity and other places. Now what I mean by a gradual path is that Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't, but you're always on that gradual path that never gets anywhere. It's sort of like an aryostat, that sometimes it goes up and sometimes it goes down. But the teaching of the Buddha is a sudden path in the sense of dropping what's on the outside world altogether and go now immediately into the inside of one's own mind. And, and so it's an inside or outside situation. So we, uh, turn that switch. We say, all right, right now I'm going to be happy, uh, to where the gradual path— and I've seen this happen many times. In fact, I have an actual story about it that I like to tell from time to time. And that is, is that our dear friend Cat Castle, who is now an ordained monk, he had a telephone call with a very famous Vipassana teaching discussion in England. And she mentioned to him that, oh, I still have defilements. And that means then to me that I need to go to the meditation hall, go do another retreat, go into deep meditation to find the solution. Or in fact, just doing the deep meditation is somehow going to burn off the defilement. This is the gradual path. This is the question that was asked on Discord. If I'm at work, What do I do about tension? The answer right then and there for both of these, whether in fact if the defilement is tension, is to take care of it right now. Don't say, oh, I have to go do another 10-day retreat and book one out into the future. The time to deal with the defilement is right now. And how do we deal with the defilement is by throwing it out and replacing it with a joyful attitude, a joyful mind. Now, when joy itself becomes a bit too much work, we can let it subside into a very easy joy, a very easy pleasure, a balanced state. But in the beginning, it's better to create joy in the mind as a skill, as a technique, so that you can bring that joy back over and over again. Now, in Sutta number 57, there is a point where the Buddha talks about four kinds of Kamma. And one of the four kinds of Kamma, actually two of them, is the ordinary world. In other words, you do good and you get good results. That's what everybody's looking for. And if you do bad, you get bad results, and nobody wants to do that. Einstein doesn't want to do bad results. He doesn't want to do light bulbs that don't work. He wants to do light bulbs that do work. So The old story of Kamma is actually the basis for Christianity. If you do something to please God, then you'll get to heaven someday, and if you do things that displease God, you'll go to hell, based upon some outside authority. Well, the same thing is true in that regard to the Kamma, in the sense of Where is the common machine who determines what I call in computer science a store and forward mechanism? In other words, we do the action now and then get the results from it much later. Well, if we do an action now and we don't get any results right now, we want the results right now, but we don't get them. Isn't doing good a form of Dukkha? Because we don't get the results right now. This is the idea of compassion, is that, oh, if I do good now, I'll get some results later for it. Which is another way of saying that if I do good results right now, if I do a good deed now, I don't know when I'll ever get a payback. Within the noble mind, we see it differently. In fact, the Buddha says that there are four kinds of Kamma, and that is the third kind is actually mixed. It's a mixed bag, and almost all action is a mixed bag. Using Edison again as the example, Edison did good things and he got bad results. So that's a mixed bag. Also, doctors, they want to cure people, but they also want to get paid. So there's always that mixed bag. Our motivations are mixed, and because we have mixed good and bad intentions, we also wind up having good and bad results as a mixed bag. So that means that there's always going to be Dukkha, not getting what one wants, or getting some of it but not everything. An example of that would be, let us say, a national ballot where there's a lot of people on the ballot, and some of the people on the ballot you wanted to win, and they do, but some of the people you didn't want to win they win too. So your voting is always going to be a mixed bag, and there's always going to be some Dukkha in there. But then the Buddha brought up a fourth kind of action, and that is an action that is just doing something in the moment for the moment and not expecting good results from it later. And also, because of the mind being noble, the action is not going to be harming someone that winds up with bad actions or bad results later. So this is called neither bright nor dark. Now, the quality of an action or a set of actions over time from a noble of doing things that are neither bright nor dark is that it brings about the end of action. So nobles wind up doing very little. I'm hearing a lot of noise. Is that— do you guys hear the noise too in the microphone? I think it's me. Yeah. Will you turn your microphone off? That Oakland, you gotta mute yourself. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** No, you're still on. Someone just mute him.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, so let me reiterate that, that an action that is neither bright nor dark, it's just an action. You don't have any involvement, you don't have a dog in the fight, then your actions don't have a result. In that regard, the nobles wind up not doing much action, just like the noble gas, like argon. And there's other noble elements like gold. Gold doesn't get mixed up with stuff. That it's always easy even if there's a mixture. You can refine and get the gold back out of it fairly easily. But argon mixed with other things is hard to get argon gas because it doesn't get trapped easily. So this would be the mind of a noble who does not get trapped into doing things very easily. We wind up staying out of the fight. So the example then would be is that there are, let us say, two pigs fighting in the mud, or maybe these are two humans fighting in the mud, and the noble is so well dressed that he doesn't want to get involved with the mud fight, and so he'll keep his distance. And not get involved with the mud fight. Well, that's like all of the stuff that happens at work. You have two people in a mud fight over, let us say, code, or what the company is going to do about this, that, or the other thing. One who is noble does not get into that argument. He stays out of it. We stay out of the ordinary world because the invitation back to the ordinary world is the same as the invitation back into the ordinary feelings of the world. So this, as I said, is a very quick process. You're either in the noble or you're not the noble. But there is also the process of bringing the mind up to the state of noble, and that in the early suttas it talks about it in two states, that is the Srotapanna and the Arahant. Now much later suttas add extra places in there, the Anagami and the Sotagami, but these were not in the original suttas. Now, one of the points that I remember to keep, and that is, is that if the teachings of the Buddha worked, and worked so well in the time of the Buddha, then there is no reason to bring later teachings in, because the later teachings may in fact interfere with the actual teachings of the Buddha. And this is a couple of examples of it, is that we don't need intermediate stages between the Srotapanna and the Arahant, because the path is actually quite clear. And that is that the point or the fruit of the path of the Srotapanna is that he is delighted in the Dharma. He keeps his mind focused in the Dharma. He cares about the Dharma. And the Sutra number 48, the Kasambhyan Sutta, is actually quite specific of 7 different knowledges that one comes to. And those 7 knowledges allows the student to bring on that fruit of being delighted in the Dharma, which means, by the way, that if we're taking delight in the Dharma, that means that we do not have much use in taking delight in the senses. Now, that does not mean that the noble doesn't— doesn't know— does no longer have these senses. He has the senses, but he's not looking for pleasure in those senses. And if he is looking for pleasure and doesn't find it, then he can just cut that off and says, oh well, never mind, not a problem. I wanted to do that and now failed in it. Let's just drop it because it's more important that I stay happy and joyful than if I get what I want. And so if we are Then practicing this way, we begin to see that the important point is for the mind to be free from the hindrances. Now, what are the hindrances? Anything that hinders you from being joyful in this moment is a hindrance. Being restless, being worried, being in doubt, wanting something that you can't have, like the girl next door, or whatever it is, that if you've got those kind of thoughts, those thoughts are going to interfere with you taking the pleasure within the mind. So the hindrances are almost always mental states that are associated with the outside. But if you can take that change from the outside to the inside and stop looking for pleasure from the outside, then the mind can be in a wholesome state. And this is the first step. Then in fact, the Buddha says that when someone sees that their mind is in hindrance, sees the mind in an unwholesome state, he knows immediately that he can drop that and come out of that unwholesome state immediately. And he knows that he can do that. He may not do it, but he knows he can. In other words, this is the confidence of the Dhamma. And a lot of people need to practice for a while in order to bring on that level of confidence that they know that no matter how obstructed the mind gets in this particular moment, we can throw that out right now. Now, the Buddha calls this first knowledge— he's got a set of statements about it that are very valuable for us to know. And that is, one is that this is noble, to know that no matter how obstructed the mind is, that we can get out of it immediately. Now a lot of people say, "Well, wait a minute, if the mind was not noble, if the mind was obstructed, how could it be noble?" The answer is that because we know that we can get out of it immediately. Now many people will fuss at themselves, they'll criticize themselves, "Oh, the mind was in an unwholesome state." Well, they're just staying in an unwholesome state. But if you can see that you're in an unwholesome state and come out of it immediately, that means that you have confidence in the Dharma. And that confidence to know that you can get out of it, then that's a noble state, is also part of the Eightfold Noble Path, to come out of unwholesome states. But an important point that's made is that this is not what ordinary people do. This is an unusual state to be able to see that the mind is obstructed and to come out of it. This is the first step of the Noble Path. If you can get this, that would be a definition that you're already noble. That you know that you can come out of your unwholesome state and then do it right then and there. Now I'll go back to the teacher, uh, who was saying, oh, I need to go do a, um, a retreat to go deep into meditation so that I can deal with the defilements. And I'm going to go to the meditation retreat next month because of the defilement that I see right here today. That's not a noble statement at all. The noble statement will be, aha, I see you, department, and I can come out of that right here, right now. That's the very first step of the nobility. The next, uh, one— there's 7 of them, and I'll go through them fairly quickly, some of them more than others. The, um, the second state. The second knowledge is, is that you can get the mind into a state of calmness, into a state of easygoing. In other words, you can gain that state. Now, the first knowledge is that you can do it. The second knowledge is, is that you did do it. You can and did come out of the unwholesome state and come into a state of ease and comfort and joy. Now, the third knowledge is that we now understand the Eightfold Noble Path as the way to handle any moment. You could say that it's your lifelong path, but it's not a lifelong in the future, but your life is long because you have one moment after another. You have one now after another after another. And so the path then is, how am I going to handle this moment? And now we have knowledge and vision of what is the right way to do it. Knowledge and vision of what is the right path, but also knowledge and vision of what is not the right path. So seeking the entertainment is not the path, but being happy within one's own mind right here, right now, that is the path. Now the fourth knowledge actually is the one that is the most difficult. For Westerners. And the way that it's expressed in the suttas is that the monk, before he goes to Patti Mokkh, will find a senior teacher or a senior Bhikkhu and confess his wrongdoing. What that actually means is, is that we begin to— it's not like a confession at the Catholic Church at all, that the Catholic Church's confession is get permission, get forgiveness so that I can go do it again. I can go and send some more and then come pay again some penance, pay, let us say, a priestly bribe, get forgiveness again, and then go do it again. So this is different than that because this is saying I can see that is wrongdoing and I'm going to put a stop to it. But I'm not going to put a stop by beating myself, but rather I'm going to put a stop to it by giving myself the right carrot of what's happening right now. In other words, we feel good that we can catch the defilements. Aha, I see you, is the statement that Karuna made. This is an important point, that we're actually happy even when we can see our own wrongdoing. Because mostly, if we're not taking joy in seeing our wrongdoing, that means that we don't want to look at it. And if we don't look at it, we can't see it. But if you can keep your pleasure while you're seeing your own wrongdoing, then we can do something about it. This is really a point of nobility, is to be able to be happy to see what we've done wrong so that we can correct it happily. Now, the fifth item on the list is done with two stories. One is that even though the young monk is doing a job like sweeping at the wat, the temple, still he's thinking about the Dharma. He wants to put it— we become interested in the Dharma, we want to know the Dharma, we want to look at the mind in the sense of joy, peace, happiness, etc., as taught by the Buddha. The second story is about a mother cow who has just given birth to a calf. And even though that mother cow is out eating grass, she keeps one eye on that calf. So this is how we would work if we got a job. If we have to do the job, keep an eye on the Dharma all the time. If that mother misses that chance of watching her new calf, the lion or the snake is right there, is going to grab that calf, then in fact mother cows will in fact station their body between the forest and the calf, so as to protect the calf. So we need to learn to protect the mind. We don't put it in danger. We keep it protected, and in that regard, we also protect it with the Dharma. We're interested and curious about the Dharma. Now, step 6 is that we become eager for the Dharma. We want to hear the Dharma. Everybody here on this call is here because they're eager for the Dharma. They want to hear the Dharma over and over and over again. Because it helps, let us say, polish the mind. We use the Dharma over and over again to polish the mind, so we become eager to hear the Dharma so that we can put it in application by hearing it over and over and over again, reading Dharma books, listening to chanting, talking with noble friends about the Dharma over and over again. We take great delight and great enthusiasm, great eagerness for the Dharma. And then number 7 is when we then know the Dharma well enough that we could see that this works, this is good stuff. And that's when we take delight in the Dharma. Now that is the fruit of the Srotapanna, is one who is steeped in the Dharma, lives in the Dharma, is enthusiastic about the Dharma, and is eager for it and takes delight in it. Now in Western Buddhism, we can see that they think that becoming a Srotapanna is an experience. Like they had a deep, deep, deep meditation experience, and they had coming out of that experience the idea that now I must be a Srotapanna, I've had a deep experience. And that's not at all the case. And in fact, those kind of experiences are a great danger, because next time that student wants another deep experience. And so experiences themselves can be a drag, can be a danger. We're not looking for special experiences. We're looking for being delighted in the Dharma moment by moment by moment by moment. So now we can say that this point is actually a point of knowledge, in the sense that if we can see clearly, then we can drop it. So the fourth and the fifth fetters— and by the way, we've come through the three fetters of personality view, which means basically the personality view is that you can change. Most religions and most cultures have the idea that you can't change. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. The fruit doesn't fall far from the tree. Leopards can't change their spots. Well, I tell you what, let me set a can of paint down in front of a leopard and he'll change his spots. He'll ink himself or paint himself just fine, thank you very much. So that's what personality view is, is that we have the view that it's too hard to change or that we can't change. So in fact, this is actually quite an easy thing to change. All we have to do is to remember to look and then make a change. We can come out of our unwholesome states immediately. Also, we are bound up in a way of thinking of this is how it should be, like, oh, you should not have unwholesome thoughts, instead of saying, well, let's not make any rules, let's just say that an unwholesome thought can be happily dealt with. And so then the third better would be what we did cover already, and that is knowledge and vision that this is the path. I've got no more doubt. Absolutely convinced, 100% sure, through evidence, through research, through watching, through noting, that I didn't get this confidence from a book. I didn't get it from a teacher. I got it through direct experiencing it over and over and over and over again. And this is what brings us to the point of being completely free from doubt. About what is the path and what is not the path. That only then leaves occasionally some defilement that comes up, but we know exactly how to deal with that defilement right here, right now. If that defilement like tension comes up, then we can say, "Aha, I see that tension." let me relax right now, and then I'll get back to what I was doing that was full of tension. And if tension comes back up again, I can stop doing what I'm doing and deal with the mind and get that tension out, and then go back and happily get it done. So this is the way that we practice. And so if we are doing that over and over again, The path from the Srotapanna to the Arahant is actually a short path. It's very easy. Why? Because the mind is already delighted in the Dharma, it's already focused on the Dharma, it's already free mostly from the hindrances. And so when an occasional hindrance does come up, got ya! And when the hindrances don't come up anymore, well, I'm glad that's over. So there's actually— these are the two noble states. The Srotapanna is where almost all of the action is, and the Arahant has very little action left because he's got very little to clean up, making it very easy. It's an easy path. It's easy in the beginning, it's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in There are no dark nights, there's no dryness, there's no putting it off. It's always dealing with it right here in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** So what do you think, Gigi?

**Speaker C:** Um, okay, here's, here's my question.

**Speaker D:** All right.

**Speaker C:** Where I struggle with this, the one place I struggle with this is people. It's so difficult.

**Speaker A:** You struggle with people. Stop your struggle. When you see the struggle, in fact, it's not people that you're struggling with. The struggle is always inside your own mind. And maybe the right thing for you to do is to not deal so much with people Even if they're in the room with you, your job is to deal with your own mind. Don't struggle with other people. Recognize that in fact the struggle doesn't come from other people. The struggle is what you're doing. So go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker C:** What you're saying is true. It's true. I could be upset at someone for maybe we're planning to work on something and they don't return a text. But the question that I always get back from someone is like, well, is it actually a good thing that they didn't return the text? Is it actually a good thing that you're not working with this person? It's like, yes, that's true. That is the wholesome thought and is actually true.

**Speaker A:** That's very Christian of you. Okay, go ahead, I'm listening. It's neither good nor bad that they returned your call. It's your choice. You made the choice as to whether it's good or bad. The way you stated it was that there's some authority up there in the sky that determines whether it was good or bad that they didn't return your call.

**Speaker C:** I'm staying with you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. So that if they don't return your call, you can be happy with that. And if they do return your call, you can be happy with that. That we don't have to say it was good or bad that they returned your call or not. Well, they didn't return the call. Okay. I'm still all right.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So there's no reason to struggle. The struggling is to find the good or bad in it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I just, you know, I guess I just haven't seen— seemed to let that go yet.

**Speaker A:** Of all the other things, you can let it go. You can let it go when you do see it. Now that you're— now that we're pointing it out to you so that you can see it, when you do see it, let it go.

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker A:** I'll report back. All right.

**Speaker C:** This is one of those last things that are like, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, yeah. So, all right.

**Speaker B:** So, Nibbana, what do you think? Yes, Dhammarato. Confidence in the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** I really, really enjoyed this one. Good one. All right, Nick, how about you?

**Speaker B:** Hey there, I'm just a few kilometers north of you right now.

**Speaker A:** Hope to visit you tomorrow at 3.

**Speaker B:** So where are you?

**Speaker A:** Thong Nai Pan. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's a bit north of Chumphon, right?

**Speaker A:** It's east of Bottle Beach. Oh, so you're on the island.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, I was gonna make sure you guys are ready for me to swing by tomorrow at 3 o'clock.

**Speaker A:** I made it with the— I guess I made the appointment with Mikey. I'm gonna be ready, but that's okay. All right, Amma, Anagami, Anapanasati, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, What do you have to say, Anna? Nothing, thank you. Everything is great. All right. Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all's good, thanks, Dhammarato. Yeah, yeah, sometimes we can, we might call someone and then maybe they'll call back and it'll be something that we like to hear. Or maybe they'll call us back and just complain and complain and complain. So you don't always want to be called back, really. So is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing?

**Speaker A:** Not sure. Yeah, well, you can say, why don't you call me back when you feel better?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm listening to one of your talks. Then they'll feel better.

**Speaker A:** Then they can call back. Or you can sing them a song, something like Don't Worry, Be Happy. Yeah, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** So Scott, good to see you, friend.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good to see you. You have anything to say about today's call?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, um, I like the part about how said we don't struggle with other people, we struggle with our own minds. And that really resonated with me. Because yeah, it is just like, we don't suffer because of other people, we suffer like how we view other people, how we think about it. So like that, that is a good reminder for me. So thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So, Miseducated. Good to see you back. What do you have to say? Okay. The visualization of the pigs fighting in the mud and then the nobleman or noblewoman just standing to the side, not wanting to get muddy, is really good for me. And Really good to hear. Yes, let them fight. We don't have to stop the fight.

**Speaker C:** If you stop a fight, you're going to get hit.

**Speaker A:** Also a good reminder not to be the pig. Yes. Which is not always easy to do in the moment. But that's a good visualization to help with that. Thank you. Good to be here. Hi. So is it Muchomer? Is that how you say your name? Yes. Hello. I like this idea of seeing the Mara and not arguing with it. And just relaxing the mental state. Okay. By the way, I thought that because of the photo or the avatar that you had that you were a lady, but I'll mention it anyway. I'm really glad to see so many females coming in. But in fact, at one time, about 2 years ago, Some dude quit because there wasn't enough women in our group, but he blamed me for it. Oh, you don't appeal to the women. All right, well, maybe I should grow a beard or something, put on some clothes. So, uh, glad to see that Anna and Miseducated and Gigi and your friend are here.

**Speaker B:** So let's see, Tom, what do you have to say?

**Speaker A:** Oh, this is profound stuff. I really, really appreciate it, especially with noting how joy is generated on the inside and not through the senses, and that's where nobility can really take shape. Really good stuff. So, Mikey, will you and the cat behind you take it from here? Yes.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, friends, for being here today. And nice to have some noble friends on the call, some smiling faces. Yeah, if you're watching us on YouTube, come join us here on the Dharma Friends Discord. There's a link to join in the video description.

Well, I'm going to leave now, but I would like it if you guys would stay on and have noble conversation among yourselves. You can talk about whatever you want. But talk about the Dharma that we've talked about today. Ivan, thank you for showing up. I've been waiting for you. Oh, I've been worried. Where have you been?

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and the Sangha, here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Theme: The Noble Mind vs. The Ordinary Mind**
The central distinction is between finding pleasure and satisfaction **externally** through the five senses (the ordinary mind) versus finding it **internally** through the mind itself (the noble mind).

**1. The Problem of External Pleasure (The Ordinary Mind):**
*   Society trains us to seek happiness through sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and bodily feelings (e.g., entertainment, fine food, praise).
*   This creates **Dukkha (suffering/stress)** because pleasure is unreliable—we often don't get what we want or lose what we have. Our happiness becomes dependent on and enslaved by external conditions.

**2. The Solution of Internal Pleasure (The Noble Mind):**
*   The Buddha taught to find pleasure **within the mind**, the "sixth sense." This is wholesome, controllable, and always available.
*   A **noble mind** can generate joy internally, independent of external circumstances. It is like a "noble gas" (e.g., argon) that doesn't react or get entangled with external elements.
*   **Key Practice:** When tension, defilements, or unhappiness arise (e.g., at work, in relationships), the solution is **immediate**: drop the struggle, relax the mind, and generate a joyful, wholesome state *right now*. Don't postpone the solution to a future retreat.

**3. The Path and Its Qualities:**
*   The path is **sudden**, not gradual. It's a shift from looking outward to looking inward, which can be done in any moment.
*   The talk references the **seven knowledges of a Stream-enterer (*Sotāpanna*)** from the Kassapasīhanāda Sutta (MN 48). The first and most crucial is the knowledge that one **can immediately abandon an unwholesome state of mind** when it is seen. This confidence in the Dhamma is itself a noble quality.
*   The fruit of the path is **delight in the Dhamma itself**—being eager for it, thinking about it, and using it to polish the mind continuously, not in seeking special meditation experiences.

**4. Practical Applications & Insights:**
*   **Compassion:** Apply compassion first to yourself. Being harsh or critical when you make a mistake only leads to repetition. Kindness and a joyful attitude help defilements subside.
*   **Action:** The highest action is **"neither bright nor dark"**—action done without craving for a specific result, without a "dog in the fight." This leads to less entanglement and ultimately the end of kammic accumulation.
*   **Non-Entanglement:** Use the metaphor of two pigs fighting in the mud. The noble person, well-dressed in inner happiness, doesn't jump into the mud. They stay out of unnecessary conflicts and dramas of the ordinary world.
*   **Struggle is Internal:** When struggling with people, the struggle is not *with them* but is a state **within your own mind**. The task is to manage your internal state, not to control others.

**5. Community Dialogue:**
*   The Q&A reinforced these points. When a participant (**Speaker C**) expressed struggle with people (e.g., someone not returning a text), Dhammarato clarified:
    *   The event itself is neither good nor bad.
    *   The struggle comes from our judgment and desire for a specific outcome.
    *   The practice is to see the internal struggle and **let it go**, choosing to be happy regardless of the external event.

### **Conclusion**
The path to a noble mind is about a fundamental shift in where we seek satisfaction: from the unreliable external world to the controllable internal landscape of the mind. It is characterized by immediate responsibility for one's mental state, delight in the Dhamma, non-entanglement in worldly dramas, and using joy and compassion as the primary tools for transformation. The goal is a mind that is free, joyful, and unshakable, like a noble element.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely a Dhamma teacher) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate the central concept of the "noble mind" versus the "ordinary mind." Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### Core Metaphors & Analogies

1.  **The Noble Gas (Argon):** This is a central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Meaning:** A noble gas like argon is "noble" because it is inert; it doesn't react with or get entangled with other elements.
    *   **Application to the Mind:** The noble mind is similarly "unconcerned" and non-reactive to the external world of the senses. It doesn't get "burned up" or "trapped" by seeking pleasure from outside stimuli (like oxygen reacts with a hot filament). It finds its stability and pleasure internally.

2.  **Gold:** Used alongside noble gases.
    *   **Meaning:** Gold is valuable and pure because it doesn't easily alloy or corrode; it remains itself and can be separated from mixtures.
    *   **Application to the Mind:** The noble mind, like gold, doesn't get mixed up or corrupted by external "mud." It maintains its purity and can easily disengage from worldly entanglements.

3.  **The Carrot vs. The Stick:** A common folk metaphor.
    *   **Meaning:** You can motivate with a reward (carrot) or punishment (stick).
    *   **Application to the Mind:** When we make a mistake or have a defilement, the unskillful, "ordinary" approach is to use the "stick"—self-criticism and harshness. The skillful, "noble" approach is to use the "carrot"—self-compassion and joy. Compassion (the carrot) is more effective for letting go of unwholesome states.

4.  **The Distorted Mirror:**
    *   **Meaning:** The mind (the sixth sense) is described as a mirror, perhaps distorted, that reflects and recombines the input from the other five senses.
    *   **Application to the Mind:** All our creativity, imagination, and even our worries are just rearrangements of sensory experiences we've already had. True freedom comes from turning attention away from this mirror of external data and toward the source of awareness itself.

5.  **The Mud Fight / Pigs in the Mud:**
    *   **Meaning:** Two pigs or people fighting in mud.
    *   **Application to the Mind:** This represents worldly arguments, office politics, and social entanglements. The noble person, "well-dressed," sees no benefit in jumping into the mud. They wisely "stay out of the fight" to keep their mind clean and peaceful.

6.  **The Mother Cow and Calf:**
    *   **Meaning:** A mother cow grazing but always keeping an eye on her vulnerable newborn calf to protect it from predators.
    *   **Application to the Mind:** Even when we must engage in worldly duties (the "job," like the cow eating grass), we must constantly "keep one eye on the Dhamma." We protect the mind from "predators" like hindrances and defilements by maintaining mindful awareness.

7.  **The Thermostat (Aryostat):**
    *   **Meaning:** A thermostat (or heater) that cycles up and down but never fundamentally changes its location or achieves a final state.
    *   **Application to the Path:** This criticizes the "gradual path" as endless striving with ups and downs. It's contrasted with the Buddha's "sudden path," which is an immediate switch in perspective from seeking external pleasure to generating internal joy.

### Key Stories & Examples

1.  **Thomas Edison and the Light Bulb:**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the "mixed bag" of kamma and the dukkha inherent in worldly striving. Edison's work was 99% "perspiration" (dukkha) and 1% inspiration. Even his great invention led to more dissatisfaction and further invention (halogen, LED, etc.). This is contrasted with the Dhamma, which offers immediate, non-dukkha-laden pleasure.

2.  **The Pope at the Opera:**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the seduction and ultimate emptiness of external, sensory entertainment. Even a revered figure like the Pope becomes a momentary spectacle, but the show quickly goes on without him. The noble one (Bhikkhu) sees no need for such entertainment, as they can generate superior joy internally.

3.  **Cat Castle and the Vipassana Teacher:**
    *   **Purpose:** A modern anecdote to contrast the "noble" and "gradual" paths. The teacher, upon noticing a defilement, plans to go on a future retreat to deal with it. The noble response, as taught by the speaker, is to address the defilement *immediately* with joy and compassion, not to postpone the work.

4.  **School Systems (Traditional vs. Experimental):**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how we are conditioned from childhood to seek pleasure externally (through praise/congratulation for tasks we don't enjoy) rather than to cultivate internal joy *while* acting. This creates a mind of dissatisfaction even in adulthood.

5.  **The Confession (Buddhist vs. Catholic):**
    *   **Purpose:** To clarify a point from the suttas. The confession to a senior monk is not about seeking forgiveness to repeat the sin (like in the caricature of Catholic confession). It's about joyfully acknowledging a mistake *in order to let it go*—using the "carrot" of happy awareness to correct course.

### Summary of Conceptual Frameworks (Which Act as Extended Metaphors)

*   **Inside vs. Outside:** The entire talk is structured on this spatial metaphor. The "ordinary mind" is oriented **outside**, seeking pleasure from the five senses. The "noble mind" is oriented **inside**, generating pleasure from the sixth sense (the mind itself).
*   **The Path as a Switch, Not a Slope:** The path to nobility is repeatedly described not as a gradual incline but as a **sudden switch** or **turning** of attention from external to internal. It's a binary choice made in the present moment.

These metaphors and stories work together to make the abstract teaching of a "selfless, pleasure-independent noble mind" concrete, relatable, and memorable. They contrast the struggle and entanglement of the worldly life with the ease, stability, and joy of the mind trained in the Dhamma.
