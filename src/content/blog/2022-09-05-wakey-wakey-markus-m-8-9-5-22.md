### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Every beginner in the practice of meditation does exactly what you're doing. But you said that you could see that and do it when I was on hold. And so, congratulations for that issue of timing, in the sense that, "Oh, now that I do remember, I should have remembered earlier." Okay? And that basically, what we're actually looking at is the residue feeling from the immediate preceding thought moment. So, one of the things that we can do when we see those kinds of thoughts is like, "Oh, I wish I'd have done this sooner," or, "I should have been doing this more often," or, "I should be doing it better," or any criticisms that you have of Anapanasati and the practice of what you're doing right now. That's actually an indication that the mind is already in that critical state, that criticism state. And so you can back up one mind-moment to see what was it that you were being critical of? What was it that was going on in your mind immediately before you woke up? This is part of the investigation. Is to figure out, now that I've fussed at myself for not practicing Anapanasati correctly, when in fact that fussing is not practicing Anapanasati correctly, but rather we bring on that congratulations. And so looking for the congratulations of, "Oh, I can see that dirt. Okay, imagine that you were a dishwasher and you're looking down and you're seeing the dish as you're washing, and you see a particularly stubborn spot. Do you feel like a failure as a dishwasher, or do you just put a little extra elbow grease on that spot and rub it right out and say, gotcha? So why can't we do that with the mind? That's the way to begin to look. Most people are already in a critical mind state, so that we're criticizing things as they occur. So when we wake up, the waking up process needs to also come— the waking, the real waking up is coming out of the critical mind into the nurturing mind. All right. And in that regard, like the dishwashers— aha, I see one more spot— that in fact, as we're putting the dish away, we give it another inspection just to make— in other words, we're actually now actively wanting to look and find the dirt, so that we can deal with it. As opposed to not wanting to see more dirt on it, that we think that we did the job and then it's not done, and so instead of saying, "Hey, I'm really glad that I caught that it wasn't done yet, and so that I can clean a little bit more and get it just like I want it." So we can apply that attitude to our practice, also in the senses, "What a relief I caught that! I caught that I woke up just enough to continue being critical, and seeing that I'm critical, rather than waking up enough to change it." all the way from the critical mind into the nurturing mind. Or another way of talking about it, and this may be a slightly different perspective, is that our society is built upon punishment for wrongdoing. Sometimes the punishment is really big, like hell. Like losing your medical license, like getting sued. I mean, there's all kinds of really great big punishments that they go around with, and prison is a really common example of that. And so, in the Buddhist model, and I was really, really happy and surprised to figure this out, that it's right there in plain sight. Really know how to look. It's that we actually are not looking for punishment for wrongdoing anymore, we're looking for rehabilitation. In that regard, you don't want to punish that plate. Imagine that when you're washing the dishes and you think you got it clean, and you look down and you see that little piece of gunk, you're angry at the plate and you break it. We don't do it that way, do we? No, instead we nourish the plate. We go ahead and do a little bit more cleaning on it, and we're very happy to get it done. So why is it that we find a little dirt on the mind, we want to break the darn thing? We want to shout at it, we want to criticize it. And so, this is actually the new practice that we have to go for, is to wake up enough to come out of that critical mind. And after we're out of the critical mind, into the nurturing mind, then we can go back with that nurturing, back to the critical thoughts that we were having. Find out what was that, that put me in a critical mind state. Because, let's say it in a kind of a strange way, even though we're practicing Sati to remember to come into the here-now, and that we use various things like that, in the sense of taking a deep breath, is an anchor into the here-now. You can't take last month's breath. You can't go back and take your first one or your last one right now. You can only take the one that you're having right now, right now. So taking that long deep breath mindfully is an anchor for being in the present moment. But there's other anchors also. In fact, 5 out of the 6 senses are anchors. In fact, when we talk about taking a long deep breath, we're actually talking about the sensations that occur, the touch of the breath as we're taking it, that we're making a change to the way that we're moving the lungs up and down. We're making a change to the way that the diaphragm operates, and then it goes back to normal. And then we go back into our normal thinking pattern and are not thinking about the breath. Isn't the human body marvelous enough so that it's got an automatic fallback mechanism for breathing, that we don't have to take every breath consciously? Otherwise, most of us would die in our sleep or die when we're surprised. That there's some mechanism in there, but that mechanism also, we can get in touch with that as a sensation or a feeling. That whenever you stop breathing, there will come sensations of the body telling you to take another breath, and sometimes we can fight and resist that, if we want to hold our breath. Many times we give into it kind of subconsciously without recognizing that it is there. A lot of the practice of meditation is to become aware of the things that are happening right here, right now, that we weren't paying attention to when we were in the critical mind state. In fact, the Buddha talks about it in the sense of six 6 sensory input states. Aside from the ones that are physically obvious, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the body sensation, those 5, we also have the mind, except for one thing, and that is the mind itself rarely, if ever, takes any new data in. It always is just processing old junk. That's its input method. The other senses take new data in, and that new data is the here-now new data. And in that regard, we have now 5 anchors to bring us into the here-now. Our eyes can bring us into hear nothing, we see a flash. Our ears bring us into the present moment, we hear a bang, we hear something drop on the floor, we wake up, we come out of that mind state. Somebody rubs into us when we're on the subway or something, that brings us back into the present moment. Most of the people on that subway car are not in the present moment, they're not in the subway car, they're in their minds thinking about something. But if they get brushed against or touched or whatever, the senses will come back into play. And yet those people who were standing there in the subway, thinking about things, could also feel the weight of the clothing and the sensations of the breathing. But we don't, we just kind of ignore so much of our sensory input. We started ignoring it when we were really little, because a little tiny infant baby has way too much sensory input. And they tell you all about it. And so slowly as children, slowly as children, we stop paying attention to our sensory input. And only pay attention to it in certain cases and in certain ways. But by and large, we're no longer in the moment, which means being in the moment means taking input from the here-now rather than processing old data. So a question for you: when you wake up mindfully to take a new breath and to change the mind from unwholesome to wholesome, and then that thought comes, I should have done this before. Is that thought in the present moment, or is it too in the past?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's in the past too, because I'm reflecting back on something that I think that happened.

**Speaker A:** So in fact, we haven't really woken up into the present moment yet at all, have we?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just for a moment, and then I went back to sleep.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. And so that means then that Sati is a skill to be developed, and we need to continue to develop it as a skill, rather than coming to the piano and finding out where C is and playing C one time and then saying, well, my practice is finished. 'Now I'm a musician.' No, we have to keep doing it over and over again, and as we do it over and over again, we begin to build skills. You'd be surprised what a real good musician can do with just the note C. And so, including adding it with other notes. So, the whole idea then is to really come into the here-now fully. I've got a little example of that. What happens the first thing when you wake up? Let us say waking up in the morning, what's the very first thing that happens?

**Speaker B:** Very first thing, probably a thought of some kind.

**Speaker A:** Well, how about the very first thing that happens is that you're aware that you're aware, the consciousness. Oh yeah, right. Generally, that consciousness is of something physical input. You become aware, you slide your head across the pillow, and then all of a sudden you become aware of that. So we become aware of some sensory input. Now, many people would say the first thing that happens when I wake up is I get out of bed. No. Sometimes we have to take off the covers. Sometimes, you know, there's all kinds of movements that need to be done, small little movements to get out of the bed. So we can think of Sati like that also. In other words, there's a tiny little bit of Sati, which is just aware that we're aware. Like, now we can wake up enough just to see the kind of thoughts that we're having in the present now. But if we're practicing strongly so that we're getting strong Sati, then we'll wake up actually enough to get out of that, to get out of the bed. So in fact, there's two kinds of waking up. One's the waking up to become aware that you've you're no longer asleep, you're aware that you're aware, or awake of, or aware of some sensation. It might be a sound, it might be a light, it might be somebody throwing water in your face, and then there's going to be a whole lot of brand new sensations. Most of them pretty cool. And so that sensory input that we get is not enough to actually get up out of the bed. And yet, look at it this way. Have you ever been to the military? Have you ever been in boot camp?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah, well, not the whole thing, but med students also have to go.

**Speaker A:** For a few weeks. [Speaker:DM] At least on occasion, maybe every other day or something like that, the drill instructor, the DI, will come barging into the room 5 minutes before 6:00 AM, banging his way in with his baton, and expecting every recruit to jump right out of bed and stand at attention beside their bed or in front of it, depending upon where the locker is. That's the kind of Sati that we're starting to develop. As soon as you get that sensory input, the banging of the baton, and we get up. Very few recruits will roll over in bed and take another 5 winks when that DI comes in and bangs that baton. Right? "Wakey, wakey!" All right, so this is the kind of idea that we're going to have with the practice of Anapanasati, is that feeling of, "I'm really going to wake up." And then, the standing of the attention would be to begin to have the nurturing thoughts, begin to take those deep breaths, to come out of the bed, rather than the kind of thoughts that you were talking about, is that, "Oh, I should have done this sooner," or, "Oh, this, that, and the other thing," would be like the reproof Laying in bed when the Anagami comes in, not a good idea. And so you'll hear me from time to time in old videos or when I'm talking to the students, I use the phrase, "Wakey, wakey, Anicca, let's wake up, let's come out of it, let's not crawl slowly out of it, let's hop to it." That's the kind of attitude that we want. Going back to the issue of washing the dishes, that if after you wash the dishes, then you rub your hand over and feel something, or you see it with your eye, that the dirty spot is still there, do we just go to that point of, "Oh no, I should have washed that dot earlier, I should have got it before?" "for now." No, we don't kind of do that. We go ahead and hop to it, and wash that plate. And so, here's a kind of interesting little point about that. Since we are quite capable of hopping out of bed, with the noise, and since we're quite capable of continuing to clean a plate until it's clean, Why is it the beginning meditator goes into this state of poor me when they see dirt on the plate? The answer is, is they don't see themselves as the dishwasher, they see themselves as the plate. I am still dirty. This is my mind. This is my dirt.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's selfishness that comes into play. That's the real trick, is can we come out of I am the dish into let's clean that spot? Let's have a go at it. Let's do this in a nurturing way rather than criticizing. Thou shalt not have dirty spots. Wait, I just cleaned you. And you know that that phrase, thou shalt not have dirty spots, is actually learned behavior that we as really little children pick that stuff up. We pick it up from the adults who picked it up when they were kids, from the adults around them. This is what Freud would call the parent ego state. That doesn't come into play when we're cleaning that dish. But when we become the dish, that's when the superego, or the parent ego state, comes in with, "You're not supposed to be dirty." This is the whole key right here. This point is the key to the correct practice of meditation and why so many students don't do it, is they continue with the critical mind. They can't come out of that superego punishing the child, which then gives the feelings of, for me, I should have done it before. I should not be dirty, I should be clean. That's the kind of victim state that we get into, because we are actually from one ego state enforcing the rules on the other, and criticizing and punishing, rather than rehabilitating. Why will we rehabilitate the plate? Right? We will rehabilitate the plate because we're not the plate. But we will not rehabilitate the mind, we punish the mind because the mind is me. And we get into these dialogues with our kids. By the way, this is the whole story behind Eric Byrne. In transactional analysis. I think we've spoken a little bit about that, right? So basically what he started with was.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on a crucial shift in attitude required for effective meditation, especially *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing).

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Problem: The Critical vs. Nurturing Mind**
The discussion begins with a common experience: a meditator "wakes up" to mindfulness, but then immediately criticizes themselves ("I should have remembered earlier," "I should be doing this better"). Dhammarato identifies this self-criticism not as a failure of mindfulness, but as the **mind already being in a "critical state."** This state is our default, learned from a punishment-based society.

**The Key Insight: Don't Be the Plate, Be the Dishwasher**
The central analogy is washing dishes:
*   When you see a dirty spot on a plate, you don't punish or break the plate. You simply apply more effort to clean it, feeling satisfaction ("Gotcha!").
*   In meditation, when we see "dirt" (a distracting thought, a moment of forgetfulness), we mistakenly **identify *as* the dirty plate**. We then punish ourselves ("I am flawed").
*   The correct attitude is to **be the nurturing dishwasher**. See the "dirt" (unwholesome thoughts) as an object to be cleaned with care, not as a personal failing. This shifts the mind from **critical/punishing** to **nurturing/rehabilitative**.

**Practical Application: How to "Wake Up" Fully**
1.  **Recognize the Anchor:** The moment of self-criticism is actually a moment of partial mindfulness ("waking up"). But it's not enough. You've woken up only to remain in the critical mind.
2.  **Investigate Backwards:** Use that moment to investigate: "What thought or feeling *immediately preceded* this critical one?" This traces the root of the unwholesome state.
3.  **Use Sensory Anchors:** To truly enter the present moment and escape the critical mind (which deals in past/future), anchor yourself in **present sensory input**. The breath is a primary anchor because it's only ever *now*. But all five physical senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) are anchors to the here-and-now. The mind sense typically just recycles old data.
4.  **Develop "Wakey, Wakey" Sati:** Develop your mindfulness (*sati*) like a recruit in boot camp responding instantly to the drill sergeant's call. Don't linger in bed (the critical mind). "Hop to it!"—use the sensory anchor (like a deep breath) to energetically shift into the nurturing, present-moment awareness.

**Underlying Psychology**
Dhammarato connects this to psychological models:
*   **Freud's Superego / Transactional Analysis' "Parent Ego State":** The critical, punishing voice is the internalized parent saying, "You should not be dirty (imperfect)."
*   **Selfishness/Victimhood:** The suffering arises from **self-identification** ("This is *my* dirty mind"). When we see the mind as an object to be cared for (like a plate), we can rehabilitate it with kindness instead of punishing it.

**Conclusion: The Skill to Develop**
Mindfulness is a skill built through continuous repetition, not a one-time achievement. The goal is to:
1.  Catch yourself in the critical mind.
2.  **Congratulate yourself** for catching it (this is the first win).
3.  Use a sensory anchor to fully shift into the **present-moment, nurturing mind**.
4.  Investigate the root cause of the critical state from this new, clearer perspective.

The talk reframes the entire practice: the "problem" (noticing a lapse) is actually the **point of practice**. It's the dirty spot on the plate that, when approached with a nurturing and diligent attitude, leads to genuine purification of the mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the challenges and correct approach to meditation (specifically Anapanasati, or mindfulness of breathing). Here are the key ones:

### 1. **The Dishwasher and the Dirty Plate**
This is the central, extended metaphor.
*   **The Scenario:** You are washing dishes and find a stubborn spot on a plate you thought was clean.
*   **The Wrong Reaction (Critical Mind):** Identifying *as the dirty plate* and feeling like a failure ("I am still dirty").
*   **The Right Reaction (Nurturing Mind):** Identifying *as the dishwasher*. You see the spot not as a failure, but as useful information. You apply a little more effort ("elbow grease") with a sense of satisfaction ("gotcha!" or "What a relief I caught that!").
*   **The Lesson:** In meditation, when you notice a distracted or critical thought (the "dirt"), don't criticize yourself (break the plate). Instead, shift to a nurturing, rehabilitative attitude—be glad you noticed and gently return to the object of meditation (clean the spot).

### 2. **The Punishment vs. Rehabilitation Model**
This is a supporting analogy drawn from societal structures.
*   **Punishment Model (Society's Default):** Wrongdoing is met with punishment (e.g., prison, hell, lawsuits). This parallels the **critical mind** in meditation that shouts at or punishes itself for "failing."
*   **Rehabilitation Model (Buddhist Approach):** The goal is to correct and heal, not to punish. This parallels the **nurturing mind**. We don't punish the plate (break it); we rehabilitate it (clean it).
*   **The Lesson:** Shift your inner dialogue from a punitive justice system to a rehabilitative one.

### 3. **The Musician Practicing the Note C**
This is a metaphor for developing the skill of mindfulness (Sati).
*   **The Scenario:** A beginner finds the note C on a piano, plays it once, and declares themselves a musician.
*   **The Reality:** Skill is built through continuous, repetitive practice. A true musician can create profound music even with a single note.
*   **The Lesson:** Mindfulness is a skill. Waking up to the present moment once is not the end of practice. You must patiently and repeatedly return to the "note" (e.g., the breath) to develop mastery.

### 4. **The Drill Instructor (DI) Waking Up Recruits**
This is a story to illustrate the quality of energetic, immediate awakening.
*   **The Scenario:** A DI bursts into the barracks at dawn, banging a baton and yelling. Recruits must **immediately** jump out of bed and stand at attention.
*   **The Contrast:** This is opposed to a slow, groggy waking up where you might roll over for "five more winks."
*   **The Lesson:** When you notice you've been lost in thought ("wake up" to mindfulness), do it with decisive energy ("Wakey, wakey!"). "Hop to" the present moment and the nurturing attitude—don't slowly linger in the critical, sleepy state of mind.

### 5. **The Subway Car Passengers**
This is an observational story about habitual inattention.
*   **The Scenario:** Most people on a subway are not present; they are lost in thought. They only snap back to the present when a sense door is strongly stimulated (e.g., being brushed against, hearing a bang).
*   **The Lesson:** We habitually ignore our present-moment sensory input (the weight of clothes, the feeling of breath) in favor of processing "old junk" in the mind. Meditation is the practice of choosing to anchor ourselves via the senses (like the breath) to the "here-now."

### 6. **The Infant and Sensory Overload**
This is a brief explanatory story for why we are not naturally mindful.
*   **The Scenario:** Infants are bombarded with sensory input and react to it all. To cope as we grow, we learn to filter out and ignore most sensory data.
*   **The Lesson:** Our lack of presence is a learned habit from childhood. Meditation is the *un-learning* of this habit, a deliberate return to receiving fresh sensory input from the present moment.

### 7. **Transactional Analysis (Eric Berne) Reference**
This is a psychological framework used to explain the internal conflict.
*   **The Concept:** The internal "critical mind" is likened to the **Parent ego state** (the internalized rules and criticisms from authority figures). The self being criticized is the **Child ego state**.
*   **The Lesson:** The struggle in meditation often replays this internal transaction: the critical Parent punishes the distracted Child ("Thou shalt not have dirty spots!"). The key is to step out of this drama entirely and into the nurturing, **Adult ego state** (the "dishwasher").

---

**In summary,** the speaker uses these metaphors and stories to contrast two modes of mind:
*   **The Critical Mind:** Identifies with the problem ("I am the dirty plate"), operates on punishment, and leads to guilt and stagnation.
*   **The Nurturing/Rehabilitative Mind:** Sees the problem objectively ("I am the dishwasher"), operates on skillful correction, and leads to growth and peace.

The core instruction is to use the moment of "waking up" to distraction not as a trigger for the first, but as an opportunity to actively choose the second.
