### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, I guess now it's starting. So now I can get it, I guess, to start.

**Speaker B:** We could do a quick video on the doubt and then, and then go to the other stuff.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, maybe Peter, um, Parker can use it then. Uh, we can do a short one. Um, so yes, you're talking about the particular doubt that is— can be phrased as Things are too good to be true now.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Which is something that underlying that is actually pointing out the fact that we have gotten used to so much Dukkha so much of the time, but now we go back and reflect and we can say, "Hey, things have been, not only are they nice right now, but they've been nice for quite a while now."

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure, totally. Yeah, the quite a while is something that I haven't really pondered that much, but you're totally right. It's always been okay. It's just taken me a while to figure that out.

**Speaker A:** So now that you're figuring that out, there's still that lingering doubt about, well, what happens when something goes wrong and that feeling and thought come up? Guess what? That's a doubt, and doubt's one of the hindrances. That's just another hindrance that comes up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no, totally. Yeah, it's— and it's— yeah, it's not that bad anymore. I mean, you're rewiring the brain is what you're doing, right? So as you keep having the wholesome thoughts, the positive thoughts, you keep throwing out the doubt, it gets better and better. But, you know, it does still come up sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so this is now part of the new skill level, is to recognize that even those kind of thoughts prevent us from actually enjoying how really good it is, because we're doubting that it can't be this good, right? Right. So that's, that's just yet another hindrance, but now it's at a much more subtle level, much, much more subtle. But it's there as a hindrance, and so that means we have to have that kind of subtlety of mind for investigation, to investigate that and say, oh yeah, right, that's just another doubt. I've seen that before, been there, done that. Never mind what we're doing. Oh, that's right, I was having a ball.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, totally. It's amazing.

**Speaker A:** The layers of doubt will come off like that. In the beginning, remember how heavy the doubt was in the sense of, oh no, who in the world can I get to fix this broken system,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Maybe I can get a politician or a Jesus or maybe a daddy or a rabbi. I need help, you know. That's a level of doubt that's really painful, then that's where we all start off.

**Speaker B:** Totally.

**Speaker A:** And so then the doubt starts to eradicate itself in the sense of you get the idea that I can do this, right? But now you're at that level of, dang, I'm doing this, can I keep going? And the answer is sure you can.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course. It's, it's, first of all, you can do it in this moment right now. You know, forget the whole future, thoughts of the future, thoughts of the past. But the second is, if you can do it right now, you keep doing it right now, then it's going to work out in the future and it's going to be even better because you build that Kamma, you build that momentum, and then it just gets better and better.

**Speaker A:** Right. You can call it a momentum if you like. I would call it a skill, but both of them are correct in a way.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that once we get things going, it tends to go in that direction.

**Speaker B:** Right. And it's funny because then I'll think I'll get like a text I don't like or something like that from someone. But it's like the responding with the Dhamma is the only obvious thing to do, you know. And it's like, why would I not want to respond with the Dhamma? You know, why would I not want to do that? Like, it doesn't make any sense, you know. And so I respond with the Dhamma and then it's fine, you know. And so I'll think like, oh, what if I don't do that? And it's like, well, it's obvious not to do that. It's like, why would I? Hit my head against the wall when I really don't need to do that. There's no reason, you know, and it's the same kind of thing, you know.

**Speaker A:** Funny, that analogy, hitting one's head against the wall. A student, you know, has used that also, that phraseology of banging our head against the wall. Um, I don't think that any of us are taught to do that specifically But that phrase has made it into our language.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Possibly a more accurate description would be feeling like we are required or somehow must move an object that will not budge.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Like beating our head against the wall in the sense that the wall— normally walls don't budge, okay? And in the— but in this context, we're talking about a mind, and minds do budge, right? They can. You can move them along. But sometimes it feels like that they're right now— it's hit a bump or a rock or some resistance, and now doesn't budge as easy as it used to budge. It feels like it's now become unmovable.

**Speaker B:** Sure, totally.

**Speaker A:** And that's also the way that it— when we have that thought of, oh no, things have gotten too good, they couldn't possibly be this good, oh no, what's bad going to happen? You know, those kind of thoughts kind of get in the way and prevent us from being able to continue to move that mind along.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no, totally. Even if it's just for a little bit, like, you know, just a moment, it still does.

**Speaker A:** Um, and it's— well, until we wake up to it, until we wake up to that thought, totally. It's just another hindrance. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And it's interesting too, so, you know, in some of my close relationships, I've, I've had the thought, you know, which, which I consider unwholesome, that, um, oh, am I just being so nice just to take care of their feelings, or am I doing it for my own, you know, because this is what I want to do. And then the obvious, you know, because they're taking care of their feelings, that's kind of codependency, right? Which is unwholesome, you know. But the obvious answer is I'm doing it because I like to do it and it feels good to do it, and so why wouldn't I want to do it, you know? So it's good for me and it's also good for them, but it's really good for me, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, Then it's both. Then it's a win-win. This is what you would call a symbiotic relationship, then, that is healthy. In humans, they have symbiosis that is unhealthy in the sense that both of the people would be better off without each other. An example of that is the woman who is the wife of an alcoholic, right?

**Speaker B:** Codependent situation.

**Speaker A:** And and that she is dependent upon him being an alcoholic because her dad was an alcoholic. She grew up tending with an alcoholic, and so she's made her husband into an alcoholic. That the likelihood that he'd stop drinking if he'd leave her— but say, but she's an enabler. So that's the symbiotic relationship that's downright dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and, and I've been in that before. So I know it. And so that's why I would have that doubt about that.

**Speaker A:** But not all symbiotic relationships are problematic. Oh, that in fact, the tender infant really needs a mommy to take care of it. And while that's happening, all the ladies in the house are gushing over that brand new baby. And so everybody's getting, you know, joy. Out of that, right? That's all. Okay, but that's another symbiotic relationship, and some of them are wholesome and some of them are unwholesome. So going back to the question that you had about dealing with other people, that means now that you can either be in a symbiotic relationship with them that is wholesome or unwholesome. Your choice. And if you choose wholesome on your side, it's more than likely but not necessarily. And in fact, you can take great delight out of hurting them. This is the stance of the bully. He takes delight in harming other people because now he's got other people feeling worse than he does, right? So he wins the bad feeling contest because he doesn't have to feel as bad as they do because he's abused them into bad feelings. Okay, so that's an example of a symbiotic relationship. That's completely unwholesome. But you can actually spread joy in a wholesome way so that people gain joy from it, and that's a very wholesome situation. That's a symbiosis that is friendly, healthy, wholesome, and is, let's say, praised by the wise.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and that's where, you know, seclusion comes in, as well as, you know, the psychotherapy literature would say boundaries, right? The importance of boundaries and keeping up boundaries. And seclusion is kind of a boundary in a sense.

**Speaker A:** What a boundary!

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, like the Himalayas, like we were talking about earlier.

**Speaker A:** Like the Himalayas, exactly. Yeah, some boundaries are really, really big deals.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And that's what I think. I think that's one of the things that's so healthy about talking with yourself and people like you is, you know, you have that seclusion, right? So I know I can have a little pity party and it's not going to affect you, you know, and that's great. You know, that's healthy boundaries at work right there.

**Speaker A:** You know, that's reminding me of something that just happened recently in a conversation basically with Parker is that I was mentioning to him about in the dialogue on Guru Viking with Dan that Dan mentioned that he had been in EMT, emergency medical and that he also does what he has called, I think, crisis intervention in the sense of meditators getting themselves into a crisis in their meditation.

**Speaker B:** Okay, which I've had a pretty bad one.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, um, what I was talking to Parker about was that just recently I I looked at the clock and to see what the time was, and from the time that the caller called in a great big crisis, boohoo, oh poor me, into gales of laughter and complete relief— 7 minutes. Wow, wow, that's 7 minutes out of complete disaster pity party into peals of laughter and relief.

**Speaker B:** I love it, I love it.

**Speaker A:** Well, only because the student is an old student so that he actually understands what's happening. But this is the power of— it's not the power of positive thinking, it's the power of wholesome thinking, which is different than necessarily positive.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I sent you some stuff about that which I thought was very interesting. And did you read the article about Norman Vincent Peale and Donald Trump?

**Speaker A:** No, I didn't, but I have actually read Donald Trump and I have read Norman Vincent Peale 30 and 40 years ago. Well, yeah, 30 for Trump and 50 for Peale.

**Speaker B:** Well, what's interesting is Peale was the Trump family pastor. So Trump spent his whole youth going to Norman Vincent Peale's church, and that's what that article is about. And he married Trump in both of his first two marriages before he died. And he was a very prominent person in that church. And I think it's hilarious, because it really emphasizes that difference between the positive thinking and wholesome thinking, right? Because this guy, like, like one thing that is, you know, maybe admirable about Trump is that he never gives up ever, and he constantly does bounces back no matter what. He withstands so much criticism, he doesn't take any of it to heart ever, which is kind of bad actually, because maybe if he did, it would help him. But, um, but nonetheless, well, that's the

**Speaker A:** distinction between the power versus the wholesome. And that's a very good distinction that you're making, by the way, because I don't think that a lot of people, when they even hear about Buddhism and wholesome thoughts, they automatically assume that means positive thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so maybe we should take a moment at least to define what that means. Why is— what kind of positive thought is unwholesome?

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what kind of thought is positive, yes, but unwholesome? Would be the kind of positive thought that's not true. It's an affirmation, it's a lust, it's a want, it's a desire. It's not real. Okay, a wholesome thought is going to be real first and positive second. Where a positive is going to be positive first, and real or not, irrelevant.

**Speaker B:** And this is where the Sati comes in. That's why Sati is so important, because Sati shows you what's really going on. And so if you don't have Sati and you're just thinking positively all the time, you know, you're going to just think positive thoughts that are incorrect. And if it's incorrect It's against the Dhamma because the Dhamma is nature, and so then it's going to be unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** So with Norman Vincent Peale's book on the power of positive thinking, it does have some power. That in fact, the power of positive thinking in one regard is in fact going to create a bully. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** And that explains also the churches, the evangelical churches that preach this stuff. You know, many times the pastor is a bully, and that comes out, you know.

**Speaker A:** And he's the only thing about that, isn't it? Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the power of positive thinking creates bullies.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, which is very interesting. And it's interesting too because I've gone through my own phases of trying that stuff out, and it's never gone well for me, you know. It's never been a positive experience.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it was always somebody else's fault. You got to stay positive about this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, it's been interesting because like this has been one of my discoveries that actually part one, one type of wholesome thought is actually being able to accept a negative thing and then work with that thing. You know, so for example, like my father, like one area of rupture in my relationship with him earlier on is that I would try to do the power of positive thinking all the time, but he loves negative news and negative articles. And so it would really just kind of exhaust me thinking that this is a problem. It was never a problem for me, but thinking it was because it was interrupting my little positivity party. And then I get all this stuff about COVID and this and that, you know, and then it's like, screw you. Like, I don't need this right now, you know. And that was kind of my approach for a long time. And now my approach is just to talk with them about it and know that it can't affect me. It just is, you know, it's just part of life. You know, and I talk with them about it, then I bring in some Dharma, and then it's much more wholesome, you know, even if it's a bad news story.

**Speaker A:** Well, now here's something very interesting that we could perhaps fill in the blanks with, is that he likes negative news because that proves to him that he's okay, because he's better than that stuff. Okay, in a way he's even more advanced as being a bully than you were even trying to become by practicing positive thinking. Sure, he's an advanced bully. He's got it down perfectly. That's why he likes such bad news, is because that helps him prove that he's okay. He doesn't even have to go around hurting other people. He just sits there just watching how bad they hurt and say, haha. Right,

**Speaker B:** yeah, like he's been really fascinated with like the con artist stories of the past 10 years, like Bernie Madoff, Elizabeth Holmes, and Adam Neumann, and you know, all of these types of stories. And so he's done Bernie Madoff.

**Speaker A:** That's the joke. Yeah, Bernie Madoff was what?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, $65 billion and a life sentence too.

**Speaker A:** 2 life sentences and 2 life sentences, right?

**Speaker B:** And a couple of dead kids too, which is the worst part of that, but— or one of the worst parts of that.

**Speaker A:** Um, but yeah, that's a big tragedy for your dad to feel really good about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, he does seem to be genuinely concerned about it, but he keeps bringing it up again and again and again, and, and it would kind of wear me out because it's like, Dad, like, I'm just trying to have a good time here and you keep bringing this up. And so I, you know, I would send him in the past like stuff like, please don't send me this kind of thing anymore. Like, I'm not interested in this, you know, please don't send it. And now I'll just talk with him about it and then change the subject to something else, you know, or make the subject more of a wholesome subject. And then it becomes more interesting. Like, for example, you know, he's been really into this Theranos story and Are you familiar with Theranos, that whole— no. So this woman, Elizabeth Holmes, claimed she had a blood test.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, yes, now I know, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so anyway, so he's been very fascinated by this, and we had a really interesting discussion the other day where, um, where I started talking with him about how beauty isn't necessarily good, you know, how beauty because she's a beautiful woman, she had a beautiful idea, beautiful product that she— or that she said it was a beautiful product, it's actually a pile of crap, but you know, the whole thing sounded beautiful, right? And I was talking to them about how beauty is neither good nor bad, you know, beauty is something that many people use, however, in order to manipulate or abuse, like Jeffrey Epstein, right? Like he had all these beautiful women around him all the time. And part of that was for his own ego and for his own enjoyment or whatever, but part of it also was to manipulate and get money from very wealthy people, you know. And same with Trump, you know, like he loved showing off like his supermodel wives and his big properties and all of this. And my dad hates Trump now after COVID, you know, after being a supporter for a while. And so that resonated too. And There's a really interesting discussion about how beauty and the Nazis even, like the Nazi propaganda is all these beautiful people, you know, like beautiful, blonde, tall. Like I took a class in philosophy of art and the philosopher was teaching that class, we had a section on the Nazis and their use of beauty and how they use the beauty to justify what they were doing, you know, to say, look how beautiful these people are, look how beautiful this society is. When in fact it was being used to mask the worst evil possible. And so I wrote an essay on that called "Beauty and Evil," and I thought it was really interesting. That doesn't mean beauty is bad, you know, beauty can be very good, you know, but you have to watch it, you have to have a little extra Sati when you're dealing with beauty.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Well, beauty is in fact built right into the Paticcasamuppada. There is a point there, and that is that when we see an object and it gives a pleasant sensation, that's the beauty. The problem with beauty is that beauty is then— let us say that we have words to describe this thing that we would call attractive, or that it is enticing, or it has the quality of that we want it. It draws us to it because we like it. So there's also that aspect of beauty.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that it has the quality of pleasure, but it also has the quality of attraction. That's why they call the girl attractive rather than beautiful. That in fact, beautiful is nice, but attractive is even better in the sense that that's what she's really going for. How beautiful does she have to be to be attractive? Not very, right? She doesn't have to overdo it. So attractive is in fact the whole point of getting something to be desirable so that it's wanted. That's actually instinctual. So beauty— and they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder— actually, beauty is in the desire after the eyes. The beauty is in the brain of the beholder, not in the eye. The eye is just the eye. I mean, all the eye does is shape, colors, form, and movement. That's about the only thing that the eye can do. All of the beauty and all of that kind of stuff, that's a quality that is manufactured deeper in the mind than the eye itself. This is actually what contacts us, is an internal representation. So two people could look at the same art object. Let's say that two people from different classes and whatnot walk into the same museum at the same time, are staring at the same piece of artwork on the wall at the same time. And they get two different reactions. Why is that? Obviously, the beauty is not in that artwork that they're looking at.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the beauty is in what they brought into the room with them.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and that's part of the whole challenge that postmodern art poses to people, you know, as they're trying to say that, oh, this piece of— this block of wood on a black canvas is beautiful. You know, that's what they're trying to say, and it's really not. You know, but they're trying to make that assertion, and because there's so many postmodern artists trying to do that, and there's so many art critics that are backing them up on that, they're making a case. And it's a really interesting case because, you know, they can't just make art.

**Speaker A:** Art's worthless. No, they have to make it desirable. And so they try at least to make it beautiful, because if they can make it beautiful, then maybe they can make it desirable, and if it's desirable, hot dog, we've got a sale!

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMARATO] Right! And so they build these movements, like Andy Warhol, like just the Campbell's Soup can— [Speaker:LAROUCHE] Can you believe it?

**Speaker A:** Can you believe that? I cannot believe that! You know that if that piece of art had been run across in somebody's basement in Manhattan or Brooklyn 100 years from now, they would have just passed through it. Oh yeah, never mind. And give it what, one second's notice is about all that canvas is worth.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. No, totally. And what's funny about that, right, right. And he was a genius at that. Like, he was one of the best people in the world when it came to talking up his art. And so he was able to make a lot of money doing that, but he also had a very ironic sensibility about it. I think he was really like a mischief maker, you know, like he called his art gallery, or his studio, he called it the factory. He said this is industrial art, you know, all of these things. And he was very, you know, trying to just poke in the eye of like our society in so many ways. I think was brilliant, but he was a miserable guy, unfortunately, and that's why he killed himself, you know. But it was brilliant, you know, what he was doing.

**Speaker A:** Well, if anything, then what you said was that he was pointing out that the beauty that people see, he could see that it was not beautiful. And maybe he came to a point in his life when he could see no beauty anywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think he did. I think he did.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so what else is left but the, the pistol or the blade?

**Speaker B:** Either the abyss or the great joy of life. And he unfortunately saw just the abyss.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So the— because if it's all equal, then one, I'd see everything equally beautiful, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, totally. And, you know, I have to thank my dad for bringing up this topic because it's a really interesting topic for us and also for him and I, you know. And so I can take these things he brings up, like another one I talked with Keishon about this the other day, we had a really nice little chat, you know. My dad brought up, you know, football. The Jacksonville Jaguars are 0-20 now, you know, it's the longest undefeated— I mean, excuse me, longest defeated streak, longest losing streak in history.

**Speaker A:** And I said, oh, they had a much longer, uh, losing streak between 500 BC and 1000 AD. They lost 1,500 years in a row. They didn't even compete, they were so bad at it.

**Speaker B:** Well, it was funny. So what I said to my dad when he brought this up is I said, oh, that's great that they have that, because when they win a game, it's going to be so nice, so nice for them. You know, it's going to be so wonderful when they finally win. And I said, I think it's better to be in that position than to be in the 16-0 like the New England Patriots were in 2007 because of all the stress that would bring.

**Speaker A:** You know what a stress it is? You've got to keep doing it. You got to keep doing it. You can't let your guard down. You've got a trophy to defend. Yeah, that's a lot of pressure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And then one thing he said is, well, maybe the best thing is 8-8. And I said, I think either 8-8 or a little bit above that. So you still have a chance at the playoffs. And then, you know, you still have a sense of possibility, but you don't have all that pressure. And the example I gave was the New York Giants in 2007 who beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl, you know, who were undefeated, right? But the Giants were having a great time because they were 10-6. They were the worst team statistically ever to go to the Super Bowl, you know. And they started winning all their road games, and then they were going to the playoffs, and it was all road games. They're wild card. They were just winning them all. They were having a great time. So when they came into the Super Bowl, this attitude of play of, oh, we're having a great time right now. When the Patriots came in with this attitude of, oh shit, we better not lose Super Bowl because we're undefeated and it would look really bad. And then who wins? The playful guys. The more— I wouldn't call them Dhamma guys, but the more Dhamma-esque guys.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a lesson that's hard to teach about. I think it was Eno. What was your friend who had called? This is the issue that he was raising. He was saying, oh, if I— yeah, Ethan, if I become happy, then I won't do anything, right? No, if you're happy, you can actually go win the game. Then when you're unhappy because you're trying to defend the title or the pressure is on, you're not likely to do as well. But when you're really enjoying the game, then you got a chance of winning the game.

**Speaker B:** Totally, 100%. And that's how they won. This is— they were really enjoying it. And it's funny too, because, you know, Eli Manning's brother Peyton Manning is like Tom Brady. He's one of these guys that, you know, everything had to be perfect all the time, 100%. But, but even if you actually look at pictures of their wives, Eli Manning is the more attractive wife, and they both have the same amount of Super Bowl rings. And one guy was having more fun, and the other guy had a stick up his butt the whole time.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's basically the choice that people don't even know that they have to make within the Dharma, that they don't understand they have a choice. So this is what the real Dharma is all about, is to recognize that we have a choice here. We can choose what we want to do. But we have to wake up over and over again because otherwise we'll go back to the default, whatever the old default was. That's the way that we will normally choose the next moment until we wake up enough to start changing that default.

**Speaker B:** Right. And that's the reverse square law. You know, the previous moment is much more important than the ones in the past. And that's very helpful. Something I've thought about a lot, you know, and that gets back to the doubt, you know, which is, you know, if the last moments were all so good, so why not this one too, you know?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But all of those layers of doubt will come off, uh, if you can pick them up as just, oh, there's just another layer of doubt. That's just— there it is again. I see that. Because then it's easy enough to deal with. That's the part that, going back to that conversation about crisis intervention, where you've got people who are meditating going to a Dharma teaching who is trained in crisis intervention, and they can have an hour-long pity party or more, right? Because they really see a crisis as a crisis rather than just a momentary absent-mindedness. The crisis is just having the thought over and over again, and if we can wake up to that thought, we can start having that thought, and now we don't have a crisis anymore. That's all there is to it. Crisis intervention then is to stop the crisis. That's all there is to it, right?

**Speaker B:** And it's so funny because I was talking with my girlfriend about something like this today where She brought up, she said, you're so positive all the time. And this relates back to our earlier conversation about positivity. And she said, like, you know, I can learn from that. You know, like, I need to be more like that. But then she made a joke. She said, like, I think you're so positive that if someone got robbed in front of you, you know, you'd just be completely fine with it. And I said, yeah, you know, I'd be really nice to the person that got robbed, but I'd also call the police. The robber, you know, and kind, compassionate person who's robbed, help them however I can, you know. And then call the police too, you know.

**Speaker A:** And the next thing I'd do is take the money out of the wallet and put it in my shoe. Why? Because this is a tough neighborhood I'm in right now. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Robbery Victim, for proving to me that I should keep my eyes open.

**Speaker B:** Well, it made me think because I actually saw that happen one time in New York. I was in Central Park, in a nice part of Central Park. It wasn't a bad part of Central Park. There aren't really bad parts of Central Park, but there are parts that are nicer than others. I'm going for a run, and it was several years ago, and I see this guy with a camera, and this guy comes up and just takes the camera from him. You know, it's this nice tourist, you know, fat, you know, happy tourist, and just having his camera robbed, and he's freaking out. And I had to think, like, I am just on my run, you know, like, just focused on my workout, and I am thinking, okay, you know, I can either get involved and maybe get hurt, or I can just keep running. And I chose to keep running. But now maybe what I would do is just watch the situation unfold, call the police, but stay at a distance so I don't get hurt myself, and then go in and see if I can help the guy that was robbed. You know, but he was running after the robber. So I don't know if that would have worked, but the first part, staying at a distance and calling the police, that definitely could have still worked.

**Speaker A:** I haven't thought about this for many, many years, but I've got a similar story. Oh wow. This one is in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Oh wow, yeah, uh, in a, um, a jewelry shop in the hotel, and that I and a friend had wandered in there just wandering around to New York, and there was a robbery scene right there in front of us, except that it was much more like shoplifting, but this guy grabbed a bunch of stuff and ran out of the store. I had— I didn't even have to think about it. I chased him down and I caught him about a block or so away. Within the seconds, the woman had already called the police. The police arrived, she arrived, but she was so grateful that here this poor southern hillbilly hick would chase out somebody like that. I mean, he could have had a knife and stabbed me, all kinds of stuff that's possible, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and that's what I was thinking. Like, I don't know, does he have a gun? Does he have a knife? You know, like, I don't want any of that, you know.

**Speaker A:** So that, that one worked out pretty well. Um, uh, the, uh, the store— actually, she was the owner of the store, and she was really grateful that we had done that. And so she gave a nice prize. Huh, that's great. So anyway, I hadn't thought about that. Gosh, that was 50 years ago.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** But when you remind— uh, talking about chasing down a robber in New York, yeah, I've been there, done that one too. So we have covered the points about beauty is actually used as a tool for coercion, that that's what beauty is. It works on the fact that it's supposedly attractive. That's what beauty is all about. So when they talk about beauty is in the eye of the beholder, who says that is Piti Barnum. That's the Piti Barnum phrase. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Let's make it beautiful so we can sell it to him.

**Speaker B:** The great-grandfather of Donald Trump. Lineage.

**Speaker A:** So much for beauty, and yet it is a big deal. It's part of Western culture, is for us to define beauty. I mean, that's what fashion is all about. Can you imagine what would happen to the clothing industry if we didn't have fashion? And the people just wore the same thing because it was still wearable?

**Speaker B:** It wouldn't exist.

**Speaker A:** Don't you think that in fact right now on the planet Earth already have been manufactured, some of us in landfill, but already even without the landfill, there is enough clothing for humanity for the next 100, maybe 200 years?

**Speaker B:** I would believe it. I believe it, you know. And it's funny too, on that topic— oh, sorry, go on.

**Speaker A:** We don't have to grow any more cotton for a long time. We don't have to do any more polyester. We just close those businesses down and just wear the old clothes, right?

**Speaker B:** And I think, you know, part of the reason we do is the advertising and the brainwashing and all of that. But there's also the seeking of novelty. On the restlessness, right? Which is people want to wear something new, you know, regularly. And that is a big part of it. It's just that restlessness of, oh, I don't have something new, so I'm not— but that gets tied into the peer pressure of everyone else wanting to also have something new. And so you also have to do that. And so part of it is you want novelty yourself, but part of it too is you you're doing what everyone else is doing. So the society is pressuring, right?

**Speaker A:** Keeping up with the Joneses, or keeping up with in general whoever, right?

**Speaker B:** Totally. And it's funny, when I was talking to my dad about beauty, I sent him that song that you sent me about the— ain't nothing gonna improve your life like a happy wife, or ugly wife, or something like that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, let's see if I can get it. You'll be happy for the rest of your life. Don't make a pretty woman your wife.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was it.

**Speaker A:** It's my personal point of view. Don't let a pretty woman marry you. Yeah, be careful where you sing that song because a lot of women don't like it. And if a husband sings it in public where his wife is listening, he's going to have a black eye when he gets home.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't think I would share that one with my girlfriend.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but share it with your dad, right? That's it, that's it. That the woman is trying to be beautiful and that she will not stop once you're married. It's a habit of being attractive,

**Speaker B:** right? And that's that.

**Speaker A:** By the way, if you listen to the lyrics of the song, that's actually in the lyrics of the song.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, cool. Yeah, listen to the whole song. And that, I think that was— yeah, that wasn't it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's, that's the reason why I sent the version with the lyrics, so that you could see what the whole lyrics were.

**Speaker B:** Oh great. Yeah, I love with the lyrics. It's, it's great. That's, that's the right way to send songs, unless they have a really cool music video. Sometimes they have that too, but this one I don't think had that.

**Speaker A:** Well, uh, these, these songs are actually educational. It's a, it's a nice happy little song, but it's also educational. It's correct that if you intend on having a trophy wife, you're going to have trouble. You're not going to have competition.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're going to have that, that's for sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Is it going to be a problem or not? And, and that's the Dhamma, you know, is are you going to get upset about that, or are you going to be, you know, like, like, it's funny, it's my girlfriend, like, she said you should be proud, you know, and, and it's like, yeah, I should be, you know.

**Speaker A:** Although pride, that's why they call them trophy wives. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the, and, and the idea then is, is that the guy doesn't think enough of himself And so he's had to adorn himself with jewelry, trinkets, maybe arms, maybe a woman who's beautiful, just to prove to himself how okay he actually doesn't feel.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's interesting, you know, one thing my girlfriend and I say a lot to each other is, I accept you, you know. And I say that to her all the time, you know, because I think it's really important, because it's like, I don't really care, like, if you do all this makeup and stuff. Like, yeah, it's nice, but, you know, like, whatever, you know. Like, I just accept you, you know. She makes a mistake, I just say, hey, I accept you, you know. And she does the same to me, you know. And that's great. That's really wholesome, you know, because acceptance is a lot better than striving and all of this.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the things that I could say about Thai women in general— not 100%, but basically Thai women in general— makeup is a toy to play with. To wear makeup in the West is a very serious business, right?

**Speaker B:** In South America too. Yeah, serious stuff. Like, and one that you said to me that was funny— oh, sorry, you're on.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the things that I was mentioning is, or about to say, is, is that if you are in a particular kind of situation, the people who are most likely to be very heavily made up are little girls under the age of 10. Why? Because they're made up because they're dancers and they're in makeup and all that kind of stuff, and they really, really go wild with it.

**Speaker B:** I think the most likely would be a female politician, and the second most likely a male one. Yeah, I mean, look at some of these people. Yeah, like, like Nancy Pelosi, like, she's 80 years old. You would never guess it, you know, you would never guess it looking at her and how she carries herself, etc. But just looking at her, just looking at a picture of her You would never guess it, but she has so much makeup and plastic surgery that she really doesn't look that age, but she is 80 years old, you know. And that's politics.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's see if we can get this back on the Dharma somehow or another. In the sense that it's part of the society that Nancy Pelosi would do that, as opposed to allowing herself to be old and happy, right? Who is she trying to keep up with, and what's the point? I would say that it's much more out of just an old habit. She's doing that because she's always done it, and she never does really look at the rationale, the reason behind it. Just like the example that I use about people putting too much salt on their food. I have seen many places, especially when I was a child in the South, that you order food in a restaurant, and when the food is served the first thing they do is they start heavily salting it before they ever taste it.

**Speaker B:** You know what Ross Perot said about that?

**Speaker A:** What?

**Speaker B:** He said he would never do business with someone that puts salt on their food before tasting it.

**Speaker A:** Well, it must be common then.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** But I imagine that Ross Perot was actually just, uh, hoodwinking because he would very much prefer to do business with people who don't listen to what he said or don't taste what he's doing. They just buy it.

**Speaker B:** Sure. I mean, he was a really shrewd guy. Like, his rationale he gave for that was that, um, that people that do that will never be happy with anything. They're never going to accept anything. They're always going to try to improve everything, and you don't want to do business with someone like that because they'll just drive you crazy. And so that was his rationale.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I use salt as an example, and it doesn't even fit as a good example for many people, but you can use other examples and begin to see a pattern. And that is, is that the same thing is true with gun ownership.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I lost you for a second. Okay, you're back. I think at least your audio, your audio is back.

**Speaker A:** All right, your screen is gone.

**Speaker B:** Oh, now you're— now it's good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so gun ownership, this is exactly the same. The people who are most likely to have a gun as an adult had guns or were around guns when they were children. This same thing is true with alcohol and tobacco and the kind of clothes that you wear, all kinds of stuff that we do as a child, including a lot of our own mental habits, are picked up when we're children, and then we go along with them to get along. That if it worked when we were a child, we continue to do it. So salting the food, we did it when we were a kid, and so until we learned the danger. And once we learned the danger code, for instance, people don't use near as much salt nowadays as they did 50 years ago or 70 years ago. Back in the 1950s, people used salt a lot. Now that they know that it causes high blood pressure and other things, and the doctors have been telling people to not have salt, about the same thing happened about eggs, that at one time they thought eggs caused cholesterol. Because eggs had cholesterol. Then they found out that no, the eggs and cholesterol— the cholesterol in eggs just flush right out. The cholesterol in the body doesn't come from eggs, it comes from cholesterol manufactured by the body. But during those years, sales of eggs went way down. People stopped eating eggs because they saw a new danger in them. Tobacco is another one. That when people see the danger in tobacco, well, some people for some reason are not able to see the danger in guns. They see in fact guns as protection from danger, rather than dangerous themselves. And yet the reality is that guns are actually dangerous. The likelihood of someone getting killed in a house that has guns is higher than the likelihood of someone who lives in a house that has no guns.

**Speaker B:** Sure, actually the tobacco thing, I want to briefly touch on that. So, you know, I used to smoke cigars and I still do every now and then on occasion, but you know, my dad— are you there? Hello? Okay, cool. So my dad, he's really into this Nicorette gum. He used to be a smoker And then he started chewing the gum. He's just been only chewing the gum for a long time. So he's been giving me this Nicorette, and I enjoy it because I feel like it brightens my Sati, you know, and it gives me more verbal dexterity, you know, my memory is a little better, you know, etc. So I enjoy it, and I also enjoy it in our conversations even because I feel it helps me bring out more that makes the conversation even better and more wholesome. You know, so I have a weird relationship to it. So on the one hand, I feel like it's bringing wholesome into my life. On the other hand, it's nicotine, you know, which could maybe kill me someday. So I'm kind of figuring that out.

**Speaker A:** When you begin to see the dangers in it, then you'll find an escape. This is a major teaching of the Buddha. It's in many sutras. He talks about the gratification, the danger, and the escape— that we do things because we get gratification out of it. For instance, anti-vaxxers, many of them get great gratification out of being an anti-vaxxer. But now that the danger has gotten very big for some of them, they can't avoid the danger, and so they're getting the vaccines. But some people don't get the vaccine until after they get sick, and now they're in the hospital and they want the vaccine. The doctors say, too late. You should have had the vaccine 2 weeks before you got the virus, right? Okay, and so that's another example that fits with this, is that people find gratification without seeing the danger, and so they continue those bad habits. And once we begin to see the danger in that habit, then we can change it. Just like you were having the thought in the beginning of this conversation, you had the thought of things can't be this good, on and on, that things have got to go bad, right? But when you recognize that that too is just another doubt, just another unwholesome thought, then it's really easy to deal with. But if we cannot see the danger in that, then we get worried about now what? Oh no, I've gotten something that needs to be protected. How do I protect it? You've already lost it when you're having those thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. And by the way, so it's almost 1 in the morning where I am. Could we switch to other topics?

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Well, let's go ahead and finish this conversation on the video and we'll start something else. Is that what you're wanting?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right. So goodbye, we'll see you in the chat.

**Speaker B:** All right, take care. Cheers.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk transcript, here is a summary of the key themes and teachings discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Theme: Overcoming Subtle Doubt with Wholesome Thinking**
The central discussion revolves around a specific, subtle form of doubt: the feeling that "things are too good to be true." This doubt arises from a lifetime of being accustomed to *dukkha* (suffering/stress) and creates a hindrance to fully enjoying present well-being.

### **Key Points and Teachings:**

1.  **Doubt as a Hindrance:** The initial heavy doubt ("Who can fix my broken life?") evolves into a more subtle version ("Can this goodness last?"). Both are identified as the hindrance of doubt (*vicikicchā*). The practice involves recognizing this doubt as a mere thought pattern that blocks joy.

2.  **Wholesome vs. "Positive" Thinking:** A crucial distinction is made:
    *   **Power of Positive Thinking:** Often based on desire, affirmation, or untruths. It can create bullies (e.g., using positivity to feel superior) and is exemplified by figures like Norman Vincent Peale.
    *   **Power of Wholesome Thinking:** Rooted in truth and mindfulness (*sati*). It involves accepting reality (even negative aspects) and responding with wisdom, leading to genuine well-being for oneself and others.

3.  **Skill Building and Momentum:** Overcoming doubt is a skill. By consistently choosing wholesome thoughts, one builds positive *kamma* (action) and mental momentum. The present moment is the point of power—if you can apply the Dhamma now, you can keep doing so.

4.  **Symbiotic Relationships:** Relationships can be wholesome (win-win, spreading joy) or unwholesome (codependent, like an enabler and an alcoholic). Wholesome relationships require healthy boundaries, akin to the seclusion (*viveka*) praised in the Dhamma.

5.  **The Nature of "Beauty" and Attachment:** The discussion explores how "beauty" is not inherent in objects but is a mental fabrication of attraction and desire (*taṇhā*). It is often used as a tool for manipulation (e.g., in advertising, politics, or con artistry). True Dhamma practice involves seeing this clearly without being pulled by attraction or aversion.

6.  **The Gratification, Danger, and Escape Framework:** This core Buddhist teaching is applied to habits (e.g., nicotine use). We engage in things for gratification. Only by clearly seeing their dangers can we find the escape. This applies to mental habits like doubt—seeing its danger (it robs present joy) is the key to letting it go.

7.  **Choice and Waking Up:** The Dhamma reveals we always have a choice in how we respond. The default is our old conditioning. The path involves continually "waking up" to choose the wholesome, playful, and joyful response over the pressured, doubtful, or negative one.

### **Illustrative Anecdotes:**
*   **Crisis Intervention:** A "crisis" can dissolve in minutes when seen as just a recurring thought pattern, not an ultimate truth.
*   **The Football Analogy:** A team playing with joyful ease (10-6 record) can outperform a stressed, perfectionist team (16-0 record), illustrating how Dhamma-like ease leads to better outcomes.
*   **The "Ugly Wife" Song:** Used humorously to discuss the dangers of being attached to superficial "trophy" qualities rather than genuine acceptance.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk emphasizes that the path involves peeling away layers of doubt by recognizing them as mere hindrances. Through mindfulness (*sati*), one cultivates **wholesome thinking**—rooted in truth and leading to joy—rather than forced positivity. This skill allows one to enjoy the present goodness, build wholesome relationships, see through societal illusions like "beauty," and consistently choose freedom over old, suffering-based habits.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about doubt, wholesome thinking, and mental habits. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1. **Rewiring the brain** – Speaker B compares overcoming doubt to rewiring the brain through wholesome thoughts.  
2. **Layers of doubt peeling off** – Speaker A describes doubt as layers that gradually come off as understanding deepens.  
3. **Hitting one’s head against a wall** – Used to describe futile mental struggle. Speaker A refines it to *trying to move an unmovable object*, illustrating resistance in the mind.  
4. **Building momentum (or skill)** – Progress in Dhamma practice is likened to building momentum or developing a skill that becomes self-reinforcing.  
5. **Boundaries as seclusion** – Speaker B compares healthy mental boundaries to physical seclusion, like “the Himalayas” as a huge boundary.  
6. **Symbiotic relationships** – Speaker A uses symbiotic relationships (healthy vs. unhealthy) to describe interpersonal dynamics (e.g., mother-infant joy vs. codependent enabling).  
7. **Beauty as a tool for coercion** – Beauty is discussed as a metaphor for attraction that can mask manipulation or evil (e.g., Nazis, con artists).  
8. **Salt before tasting food** – A metaphor for ingrained, unexamined habits; compared to other habits like gun ownership or makeup use.  
9. **Doubt as a hindrance** – Doubt is framed as a subtle obstacle that blocks enjoyment of the present, like a cloud over clear weather.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Crisis intervention turnaround** – Speaker A shares a story of a student moving from “crisis” to laughter in **7 minutes** through wholesome reflection.  
2. **Norman Vincent Peale and Donald Trump** – Speaker B references Trump’s upbringing in Peale’s “positive thinking” church to contrast *positive* vs. *wholesome* thinking.  
3. **Father’s fascination with con artists** – Speaker B discusses his dad’s interest in stories like Bernie Madoff and Elizabeth Holmes, leading to a conversation about beauty and manipulation.  
4. **The 2007 New York Giants** – Speaker B tells the story of the underdog Giants winning the Super Bowl with a playful, low-pressure attitude vs. the stressed, undefeated Patriots.  
5. **Robbery in Central Park / Waldorf Astoria** – Both speakers share personal stories of witnessing or chasing robbers, exploring how to respond with compassion and wisdom.  
6. **Andy Warhol’s “factory” art** – Used as an example of how beauty and value are constructed by society, not inherent in objects.  
7. **Ross Perot and salting food** – Anecdote about Perot judging business partners by whether they salt food before tasting it, illustrating rash judgment vs. mindfulness.  
8. **Nicotine gum use** – Speaker B shares his conflicted experience with nicotine gum, tying it to the Buddha’s framework of *gratification, danger, and escape*.

### **Themes Linking Metaphors & Stories**
- **Doubt as a subtle obstacle** that fades with recognition and skill.  
- **Wholesome vs. merely positive thinking** – illustrated through Trump, Peale, and personal examples.  
- **Habits and conditioning** – shown through salt, guns, makeup, and childhood patterns.  
- **Beauty and attraction** as potential traps, discussed via art, con artists, and relationships.  
- **Playfulness and ease** leading to better outcomes (Giants story, meditation joy).

These metaphors and stories help ground abstract Dhamma concepts in relatable, everyday experiences.
