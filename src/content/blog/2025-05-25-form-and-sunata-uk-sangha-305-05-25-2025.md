### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. This is, uh, the UK call, we call it, so because it's, uh, intended for people in the UK and in Europe. It's Sunday morning there, and today, um, I'm going to be talking about, uh, a particular word. And the word that we're talking about today I would use the word form. Now, this comes from someone asking a question about formal meditation, and that we can define formal meditation in various ways, but the point is, to get started, that all developed skills requires a form, and that the example that I will give is wet cement or concrete. That if you're going to build something, you have to create forms, and the forms then are going to have a structure of where you're going to pour the cement as well as reinforcing steel bars and other things like that. So when you pour out the cement, it doesn't just roll out on the floor. It requires a form. And once you pour the cement in the form, it takes a while for it to cool down or warm up, depending upon the situation. And you see, there we go. So after the cement dries, then the forms are to be removed. Another way of looking at it is, is that in the old days, and in fact they still do this today, when building a building, they will use scaffolding or forms, and that they build up the scaffolding first, and then the men stand on the scaffolding and put the building together. And then after the building is put together, they remove the forms. Doesn't that make sense, Timo? Does that make sense to you, that once you build the building, you take the forms down?

**Speaker B:** Definitely.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that in fact fits exactly with our practice, that we practice by putting something into a form. You can even use the word formal, and that that's an example of that then would be doing a retreat, and many people call doing a retreat formal.

**Speaker C:** Or.

**Speaker A:** Let us say sitting in a particular room, a large room with the men on one side and the women on the other, and a dais at the front with maybe a picture of a Buddha or monk or something with candles and incense. And all of those are what they call formalities, because that's got really nothing to do with the actual practice. But what does have the actual practices is that you've stopped doing whatever wet cement does when it's poured out, and that you set it into a form. And so this is the way that we are going to practice, is by setting our minds into a form or a structure So that we can practice correctly. So the correct practice then would be using a correct form. For instance, if you're building a column, then you want to have a form for a column. You can't have a form for a sidewalk and expect a column to come out. So the right form then is going to determine the structure. Another way of looking at it would be a cast. That if you've got a broken arm, a broken bone, the doctor will set the bone, but it'll come unset all by itself unless you put it in a cast and immobilize it. So that's another form, our understanding of form is that we're immobilizing something, we're setting it so that it can't move around a lot. And this is exactly what we're going to be doing with the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path and Anapanasati, is we're going to set up a situation. Normally, the forms that we use is a verbal form. I say, do this and do that and do the other thing. But many people have images of, let us say, a retreat setting or whatever, and they have the idea that the formal has to do with an outside appearance of everybody sitting around in a particular certain way. But the real form is the form for the mind, that we're going to put the mind in a certain condition or specific thing and then practice being in that state until the formation is finished. We can also think of it as a musical instrument, that if you're going to learn to play the piano, it's better to have a piano with a keyboard, with your fingers on the keyboard pressing keys. It's not going to help you a whole lot to learn to play the piano by holding a clarinet or a violin. So this is really important. If we are going to be practicing having a form of putting the mind into a wholesome state, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for people to sit on the floor with their bodies in pain, aching, noting, looking, but not doing the actual practice that's specified by the Buddha. Does that make sense? Karuna, does that make sense to you? Yes. So if we are going to practice satisfaction, then we need a form for satisfaction so that the mind can be placed into a state of satisfaction and kind of locked in place. So that there's not a lot of wiggle room, just like on the forms for cement. There's not a lot of wiggle room. You want that form to stay there. In fact, I have seen videos of people pouring cement and the forms broke. Means the cement just spills out all over the place, and boy, what a big mess that is. Well, this is what the human mind is, is that we need to have these strong forms, we need to have repetition over and over and over again until the neurology begins to set into place. This is basically then the same thing then that we can talk about in the sense of seclusion. Of getting away from other people, especially people who are unwholesome. Because if you're listening to someone with ordinary thoughts, even in their background, if you're listening or hearing that, that's a way of disturbing your form. So getting off into seclusion, getting away from others so that you can actually practice the skill that we're talking about. Now, another one I've heard kind of recently, but I've heard it before, that some meditation teachers tell the student to quieten the mind and to make it silent. I don't know of anybody who can do that without a whole lot of practice being able to control the mind. The way that I would talk about it would be like a great big container ship, or maybe an aircraft carrier, big huge ship. The interesting thing about big ships as well as actually canoes, they don't have brakes. You can't stop a big ship. What you can do is at sea, you can steer the ship. And so this is what we're going to be doing in our practice, is setting the form in order to steer the ship into the right direction. That we're not trying to stop the mind at all. What in fact we're doing is that we're setting it into a wholesome state. Can you imagine someone who has practiced stopping the mind and they've got no thoughts? And then somehow or another, without having a thought of it, they have the thought that they've got to drive to town. And so they get in their car, and without a thought, they think their way into starting up the car and driving off. This is how a lot of people kind of think of what stopping the mind is, but when the mind is stopped, you can't drive a car. You can't do it without starting up the mind again. So in fact, we're not trying to practice something that's impractical. What we're practicing is something that can help us live our lives, regardless of what that life is, wholesomely and happily, because that's the way that we are forming the mind. So there's no real use for formal practice unless we're forming that practice to be wholesome, correct practice that takes us in the right direction. And most formal meditation practice is not good practice. They're looking more on the outside. Can you hold the body still? Well, holding the body still has some advantages, but you don't have— in fact, most of you, those of you who have your cameras on, your body is pretty still. I see Timo is still, and Mikey is still, and Santiago is still, and Paul is still. I don't see a lot of body movements. And so we can actually practice being still in basically any posture. Now, another point that the Buddha made, and made it quite often, he talked about poor postures. Now, poor postures were just the, let us say, the common language of the day. That in those days they had a reclining posture, but there's a whole lot of different reclining postures. You can be on your back, on your tummy, on your left, on your right, curled into a ball, all kinds of reclining postures or laying down postures. And then walking postures. You can walk with a particular gait, you can skip, you can hop, you can do all kinds of things while walking. And there's also standing, and when people stand, they'll stand and fidget and move from one leg to another, back and forth, twist their bodies around. Anicca, etc., like this. But basically there's only 4 postures: standing, walking, sitting, reclining. But those are just basic. If I were going to add an actual posture, I would use the reclining posture in the sense of the way that they sit on couches in ancient Rome. In other words, the reclining posture, there's somewhere between sitting up and reclining, or maybe even a recliner where you put the chair up with the legs and back with the back. So these— there's many different postures in reality, but we can think of whatever they are, they can be readjusted into the four primary postures, and that we practice in any of the postures. So the actual posture of the body, not so important, so long as we're still using that form to keep the body in whatever step that we're in. For instance, slow walking or standing or whatever. Can you stand at attention? Can you stand upright? When you're sitting, can you sit upright? But the important form that we're talking about is the form that we put on the mind and the feelings and the mind's objects, so that we are having a form for each one of the Satipatthana, because we're practicing all of the Satipatthana. One of the things that I would say about the Anapanasati practice is that it's not a breathing meditation. It's a complete meditation that we have forms or formalities for each one of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And that we would say then for the mind's objects, we're going to make the mind's objects wholesome. For the attitude, we're going to have the attitude of gladdening the mind, brightening the mind. For the feelings, we're going to have a state of safe security, comfortable, and also satisfied. So this is the form that we would put it in. So I would hope then that anytime someone asks you, "Oh, do you have a formal meditation practice?" you'll repeat this lecture to them, because it's actually a bad question. We don't practice formally in the sense of the way that Western people have gotten used to looking at it, but the real question is not are you practicing formally, but are you practicing correctly, and that correctly means that you've got forms for your structure, that you're going to have a particular form that you're going to use for, um, let's say, uh, changing the, uh, the thoughts from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. We can also have changing the mind's attitude from an unwholesome attitude, a victim's attitude, into an attitude of gladness, brightness, a winner's attitude, an attitude of I can handle this. So this is the way that we would practice using these particular forms or formats. And if you continue to practice using that form, then when you take the form off, If the mind is set, then that means it will continue to hold the structure that the form used in the first place. This is an important point that you want to put your practice is actually practicing using a particular form or format, and you continue to keep the mind in that form or that format. You continue to keep your attitude in that form or that format, and you can start to put the feelings in that form or that format. There's nothing formal about it. No black ties, no tuxedos. There's nothing about anything that we call formal. What we can do instead is take that AL off of the word formal and think of it as a form or a cast, as it were, or let us say a format for practice. Now, one of the important ways that we can do this is by getting into seclusion. When we're saying getting into seclusion, generally what we mean is getting away from all of the places of the world that has no particular format, or the formats that they're using are unwholesome. That in fact, Western culture has trained our children with forms and formats of being unwholesome, unhealthy, wanting, needing. Grasping, clinging, loving, wanting, all of these kinds of things were forms that were used when you were a child. And another form that's used quite commonly is work. Oh, you've got to work, you've got to work hard. If you don't work, you don't eat. Well, we're going to take those forms away. And we're going to put up the form of just sitting still, having the— having a form of just being quiet, having the form of having the mind brightened, gladdened, having the forms of being free from the hindrances. That being free from the hindrances is in fact the most important one. This is listed as the first item, that if you still have a form that includes hindrances, then your form doesn't give you your desired result. So the first form that we would want to manage, to develop, would be the form of not having any hindrances in the mind. Any doubts? Now, some people have thought that, oh, it's good to doubt because without doubt you'll never learn anything. And the answer to that is that's absurd. You can in fact learn something, but because you've got interest, there's no reason to have the quality of doubt that you can investigate. Without having the quality of doubt. And oftentimes what we'll see when people are given the instructions of brightening the mind, gladdening the mind, changing the mind out of the hindrances, you know what? That form of doubt sticks. It stays over and over and over again. This student will ask questions. He wants to know, he wants to know, he wants to know. Why? Because he was raised with that form of asking questions. Well, guess what? Once you get into the habit of asking questions, there's no end to the questions. There's factors, there's stories about 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds who just go around asking question after question after question. And they really don't learn anything because they're too busy formulating the next question. And then some of us grow up just asking questions. We never really get anywhere with it. And so we can drop that form of asking questions about our practice because it's actually quite simple, and replace it with the form: I'm going to keep my mind in a state of gladdened. I'm going to keep my mind in the state of, or the feeling in the state of being satisfied. Now, what happens is that we can use that form, and then immediately it falls apart, because we haven't established the form well. We can see that all the time when the student will say, "Okay, I'm gladdening my mind." Okay, wait a minute, it's not gladdened. Well, that means that their form just fell apart. They need to strengthen that form so that they can say, I'm okay, I'm all right. And then the next thought will be, I'm okay, I'm all right. And then the next thought, I'm okay, I'm all right. Over and over and over again, we practice this, practice keeping the mind in within the form that we're using. We want to develop— in fact, you could say that these forms that I'm talking about, and there's quite a lot of them, are the skill development itself. We develop the skill of keep coming back to a happy, wholesome thought. We keep developing the skill to remove the hindrances, especially including doubt. It's really, really hard to be doubtful and to be joyful at the same time. Then in fact, I would go so far as to say that when you can mix joy with doubt, it's no longer doubt. Now it's just merely curiosity. And so be curious to look and investigate what the mind is doing. Do it joyfully. In other words, we're going to add this form of gladdening, brightening the mind, or you can use the word joy or happiness. And we practice this over and over and over again, and guess what? Once we continue to practice this over and over again, it will develop the habit. And then, after that, we don't need the form. And sometimes we don't need to form, and then we go out in the world and all of a sudden things fall apart. Our cement wasn't really dry. Never mind, let's go back and put the forms on it and make sure that it's set, so that when we finally take the form off, that's because the skill is fully developed. And so I would say then that everyone practicing correctly eventually doesn't need the form because their mind has become set in that wholesome framework. And so asking a senior monk or an Arahant or someone like that, "Do you still do formal practice?" You can see what a stupid question that is. The answer would be many different ways of answering, and one of them is that what else is there to do? Or, I never used an 'ow' with my form. I never used a formal meditation, but I used forms, I used structures to keep the mind in a state. A formation. Now, this is an interesting side point. I have actually heard the Pali word Samskara to be translated as the word formation. Yeah, all right. Guess what? What really they mean by Samskara is that it never was in a form. It never was inside of a structure that kept it. The way that I would talk about that is that a library with a— let us say it's old-fashioned now, I don't know what they're using, but in the old days they had the Dewey Decimal System. The Dewey Decimal System was a form. And that they would put the books in the library according to this system, to where Samskara is much more like a library with all the books pulled off the shelf. They're all over the floor. They're in a big pile here and a big pile there. And so the word formation is not a good translation for the word Samskara. Now, what is a Samskara? A Samskara is basically a pile of junk. And what we're going to start doing is, instead of having a pile of junk that we're carrying around in the form of memory, we're going to start systematically adding stuff to that library. Systematically, not just adding in willy-nilly anything that came out of society, but we're going to systematically add joy, systematically add deliciousness, systematically adding things to the top. You can think of, in fact, Samskara as a bunch of crap, because that was how it was brought in, that's how it was stored, and it was never organized. Now we're going to start organizing the mind. We're going to start putting forms in there. Maybe you can think of it as starting to put shelves up so that you can catalog your memories, etc., like this. This is a way of thinking about it, rather than just leaving memories as an old pile of stuff. In fact, Sigmund Freud was quite famous with his system he called free association. Paul, have you ever heard of Freud's free association? No. Yeah. What does free association mean? It means whatever came up, right? That everything and anything is freely associated to move from X to Z, to move from Y to F. There's no structure there. And what we're doing here is we're organizing the mind so that we can move from one wholesome thing to the next wholesome thing to the next wholesome thing. This would be the organization or the form that we're using to put the mind in. And the way that we start training is by training it to become free from the hindrances. No more hindrances, at least not now. And when the hindrances come back, got it, I could see that hindrance. The hindrance of greed, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of restless mind, worrying, wanting something, etc., like this, or doubt. Also, there's a twin group called sloth and torpor. And what that actually means is that we're not paying attention. And so part of the form that we're going to use is to be alert, be awake, make some effort to pay attention to what the mind is doing. This is the form that we would use. And we can do this in seclusion. Basically, it's best to do this in seclusion. If you do it in classroom, the teacher's likely going to call on you, telling you to stop daydreaming, come back to the class. So if you're in class, then the form that you would use is pay attention to what the teacher is teaching. That would be the form. If you're driving a car, then the form that you would use is Watch where you're going, watch where you're driving, watch the traffic. But when you're sitting alone and practicing, the form that we'll use is keeping the mind out of the hindrances, keeping it out of unwholesome thoughts, keeping it into wholesome thoughts over and over and over so that we have one wholesome thought after another after another. Only then, when we have wholesome thoughts one after another after another, can we begin to put gaps in those thoughts. But only after we have a mind that's well trained enough to have one wholesome thought after another. This is the way that we would steer that ship, is to have one wholesome thought after another after another. And once we're going in the right direction, and especially reaching port, that's when we would turn the power down. But while we're actually practicing, we want to put the right effort into it, the right effort to keep practicing, keep within that form, stay within that group. Of practice items. So, Karuna, do you have any questions about this?

**Speaker D:** Many questions, like always. Dhammarato, in one way it is very clear, but you said, so we have 4 satipatthanas, and for each one of them we will develop a forum, a habit. Basically, I understand that we have the body, feeling, mind, but the fourth one, I don't really understand. So I understand body, feeling, and mind, but the fourth one, I don't know how to develop the fourth one.

**Speaker A:** Mind and mind objects. All right. The mind, when we talk about the mind, we're talking about the state of mind. What state is your mind in? Because the state that your mind is in will determine the kind of thoughts that you have, and the kind of thoughts that you have will influence and determine the state of mind that you're in. For instance, somebody can be in a nice state of mind and walking along, and they can stub their toe, and their toe hurts, and they don't like it. And all of a sudden they move out of the state of mind into the state of a victim's mind, and they may shout out and hate whatever they stumbled on. Okay, so in this case, the feelings of stubbing the toe affected the mind state, and then the mind state affected the mind's objects. So you can see all four of the Satipatthana there. The body affected the feelings, the feelings affected the mind state, and the mind states affected the mind's objects, the thoughts that we have.

**Speaker D:** So the mind's objects are just the thoughts?

**Speaker A:** Yes, whatever is in the mind. Now I have a very broad use for the word thought. And I'll define it for you here, is any way that you spend a mind moment. The mind moment, in fact, you could say if you're looking with your eyes and you're actually watching and observing, that's a kind of a thought. Why is that? Is because when you're looking at something, you're actually thinking about it. All right, so if you've got an itch and you start to scratch it, that may be mindless, but in fact the scratching that was done by the hand was ordered by a certain part of the brain, already in the state of not liking that sensation of the itch. And so the mind is actually quite fast. And so what we're doing is we're putting these forms, or these scaffoldings, or these casts around the mind so that it doesn't jump back and forth between them so easily. And so that you can settle the mind down so that you can actually look at your mental state of mind. The thoughts that go with a gladdened state of mind would be, wow, I can do this, everything is really okay, wow, nothing to do, nowhere to go. And with that, then you can begin to form the way that you want to feel. Anybody can feel the way that they want to feel, but almost all cases people feel the way that they felt when they were a child, and they're just repeating the old habit of feeling the way that they felt when they were a child. However, we in fact, using these forms, can change the way you feel. Using the form of— with the feelings of Feeling safe, feeling secure, feeling comfortable, feeling satisfied, feeling like everything is actually okay the way that it is. This would be a form that you would use for the feelings. The form that you would use for the mind state would be the form of gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, coming out of the victim's position, coming out of the state of, "Oh, I need help," or, "Oh, I don't know what to do," or, "Oh, I'm in a state of doubt into the state of, "I can do this, I can handle this, no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can clean that out and see what things really are about." The Buddha, in fact, in Sutra 48, in the Kamsambhian Sutta, mentions this, that no matter how many hindrances that there are, we can put that form in place right then and there. And that form is, I can throw all of that stuff out and come back to a state of being okay. No matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can clean that out. Now, that would be a form that we can use, and I would recommend that you use that form on a regular basis. The form of throwing out whatever unwholesome thoughts are in the mind and replace it with the thought, 'Well, I can do this. I can handle this. I can gladden my mind. I can bring it up to the top.' No need to be the underdog. We can be the top dog. So go ahead, Karwan.

**Speaker D:** So that's that attitude of 'I can do it.' Is that Is that part of mind objects? Satipatthana mind objects?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, no. The word "I can do it" is a mind object, but having the attitude "I can do it" is the mind state. Having the attitude— so I use the word attitude to help people understand what a mind state is. In the suttas, it's got a lot more. Is the mind bright? Is it sharp? Is it exalted? Is it on top? That's what exalted, by the way, means. I think that the translators were a little exuberant with that one. But exalted means that it's on top, on top of the situation. We can handle this, as opposed to being buried under. So that's what a state of mind would be.

**Speaker D:** That's the state of mind. But for me still, I have confusion about the mind and mind objects. I don't see the difference between those two.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's the form for you. Go see the difference between your attitude and thoughts. See that your attitude creates thoughts. And if you change your attitude, it will change your thoughts. And that your feelings actually will influence— they all influence one another. But there is definitely a state of mind that you're in. That state of mind, in fact, may not have many words to it. Or it can be very talkative. But we're talking about a state that the mind is in, a state of being gladdened. Right now you're in the state of mind of being confused.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I invite you to come out of your confused state of mind using the form of I can gladden the mind. I don't have to be confused. I can see things clearly. That being confused is just an old system that you've used, an old form that you've used, and you've gotten your mind in that state. And so you can come out of your confusion, brighten the mind, gladden the mind, so that you can see clearly that you've changed your mind state. Timo, do you understand what we're talking about, the differences between the mind's object and the mind state?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I grasp the difference intuitively, like with the— how does the mind seem to be, is it like exalted, scattered, whatever, mind's objects.

**Speaker A:** Isn'T it.

**Speaker B:** Important to also have another frame within.

**Speaker A:** Them.

**Speaker B:** Like themes, like wholesome, unwholesome, or hindrances, That was my understanding of mind objects in the Satipatthana, that there are the categories of objects. It's not just any thought, but thoughts already put into forms this way.

**Speaker A:** All right. So Karwan, maybe this will help. Think of the mind state as like a bucket, and the mind's objects are what's in the bucket. And if you keep carrying a bunch of crap in your bucket, your bucket is going to look like crap. But if you polish up that bucket, then it's going to make whatever you're carrying in the bucket better. And so we're going to actually use thoughts of cleaning up that bucket, brightening the mind, cleaning it up, so that the bucket no longer says, "Oh, this is too heavy. Oh, I'm ugly when I'm carrying this stuff," into having a bright, shiny bucket that can say, "Hey, I'm proud to carry this stuff.".

**Speaker D:** That may help you. So the mind affect the mind objects, basically.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And then what else is, why do they have made it into 4 things instead of just 3? Just mind, feelings, and— but no, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's a little example of that. Imagine that you've got a prize fight. And at the end of the prize fight, they have a declared winner and the other guy is the loser. Now, after the fight, they both go and get a massage because their body's beaten up pretty bad, and they'll use a masseur to try to soothe those aching muscles. And while the two prize fighters each are in different rooms getting a massage, they're going to have different thoughts. They're not going to be thinking about the same thing. The winner of that fight is going to be thinking about thoughts and thinking thoughts of the winner, like, oh, that was a tough fight, but I did it. I'm the champion now. And the other guy who lost the fight is going to be having old poor me thoughts. He's going to be the victim. And because of that, his thoughts are going to be influenced by the kind of attitude that he has because he lost the fight. So this is a way of looking at it, is that our attitude changes quite a lot, and we're not even aware of our state of mind. So begin to look at the state of mind. Begin to have a form of what you want that state of mind to look like. You want it to look like the winner, exalted, everything is okay, not a worry in the world, as opposed to having the state of mind of a victim, sorrow, not good enough. So these are the forms that we'll use in practice. And we want to continue to keep those forms in place because our mind is still kind of fluid. It's easy to be modified, so let's keep those forms in place so that in fact the mind begins to get the habit of being in that state that is inside of that form and being conditioned by that form. So you can say then that the Eightfold Noble Path or the Eightfold Noble Method that the Buddha gave is actually a set of forms. The form of remembering to look, the form of looking, the form of changing that. And then in the Anapanasati Sutta, we've got various numbers of skills to be developed. But you can also think of Sati itself. That's a skill to be developed, which means that we need to have a form for it. And the way to do that is keep telling yourself, "I'm going to remember. I'm going to remember to look at what's going on. I'm going to remember. I'm going to remember to watch. I'm going to watch. I'm going to watch and change." And so those are those three forms that we'd use over and over again. And then the Anapanasati Sutta, we would say, I'm going to gladden the mind. Then in fact, in the Anapanasati Sutta, the Buddha says specifically with the phrase, thus one trains oneself. I'm going to put my mind into state of Sukkha. I'm going to put actually the feelings into the state of Sukkha. What is the state of Sukkha? The feeling of feeling easy, the feeling of safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. So we're going to keep practicing being satisfied. Yeah, I got that. I got it. I'm satisfied with it. Just enough. So these are the forms that we would be developing. And all of this talk has come out of the idea that some people think that there is a formal meditation. And a formal meditation has almost always got the wrong forms in it. And so take that Al out and put the forms as correct forms. And then the correct forms are very well specified in the— actually, Sutra number 117. Is the Eightfold Noble Method, and at 1:18 is the Anapanasati Sutta. These suttas go very, very closely together. And remember that phrase, "Thus one trains oneself." In other words, get back into that form, stay in that form. Keep coming back to that over and over again. So Rick, good to see you, friend. Do you have something to say?

**Speaker E:** Um, no, not that much actually.

**Speaker A:** Does this talk give you any new insights into how to practice?

**Speaker E:** Yes, it does, in the sense that it kind of gives this feeling of, you know, I usually hold off or like I feel like I hold off on like long practices unless I'm like in some type of, you know, meditation hall or whatever. But I guess I've been using that as a a formal— I need the formal practice or something like that. But yeah, it inspires me to just do those longer sessions as well at home.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you instead of calling it a formal practice, call it practicing consistently over that period of time with correct forms. To put the mind in those boxes that we want to maintain. That box of only wholesome thoughts. That box of gladdening the mind, brightening the mind. Put the feelings in that box of safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied. Eventually we'll bring on the other feeling of wow. Success. Over-the-top success. In fact, I'll add another word to it, and that is wealthy. We become wealthy with the Dharma. But how do we get wealthy with the Dharma? Is by getting successful with the Dharma. Practicing over and over and over again. That skill of Sukkha. Thus one trains oneself. So Santiago, what do you think? I think it's very good.

**Speaker F:** Practicing constantly, not just once a week, because then you got like 80 hours, waking hours of, you know, messing yourself up. All the time practicing.

**Speaker A:** So you've gotten some new insights. What do you get out of this talk?

**Speaker F:** The Sankhara one.

**Speaker A:** I like that.

**Speaker F:** So, Sāve����ankhara, Anicca, be all trash is impermanent.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, big pile of trash, not organized at all. Ah, Chris, how about you? Do you have anything to say?

**Speaker C:** Uh, it's a big topic.

**Speaker A:** Uh, well, you can use the form of— this is easy, this is not too big.

**Speaker C:** No, it's not easy, but it's easy to get started. And then you have to persist.

**Speaker A:** But it comes along.

**Speaker C:** So formal meditation for me is a time, a little box you build for yourself where you shut out all this bombardment of the world and you develop a practice on a regular basis with some rituals where you you start to try repeatedly on a regular scheduled basis to learn how to slow your mind down. And once your mind stops racing, and it helps if you can shut off all those distractions, right? Once your mind stops racing, then the rest of it will come along in bits and pieces. You'll learn about your bodily sensations. And that will just naturally lead to learning about your feelings, and that they're both just constructions, right? Everything you think you know about the world is a product of your mind. It's memory, it's sensory perceptions. Everything is in your mind. And then so there's a process of getting to know your mind and then retraining your mind. But understanding it all at once by reading a book is not going to happen.

**Speaker A:** Not going to happen.

**Speaker C:** It's not going to happen.

**Speaker A:** We have— but it does forms in.

**Speaker C:** Place, like persistent, mindful concentration, effort.

**Speaker A:** So one of the forms that I talk about is reading the book between your ears, which would be— and then be look at your feelings, look at your, uh thoughts, look at the mind's objects, and also look at the state of mind that we're in. And between the ears is also part of the body. So when I say read the book between the ears, that's all for the Satipatthana right there.

**Speaker C:** And the best is your life. Every time you feel a sense of frustration, there's an opportunity.

**Speaker A:** That's it right there. See that frustration.

**Speaker C:** And the third Satipatthana of the mind, the difference between mind and mind objects. Third, feelings is a little— okay, so body is easier to grasp in your mind, what it means for body. And then that leads to feelings. And then that leads to mind. What's my mind state? That's easier than these intricate stories of thoughts. In mind, you can break it down into the three poisons. Is my mind in an unwholesome state? And if so, is it anger? Is it greed? Or is it delusion? If you want to go past those three, the Abhidhamma has 89 different states of ways to categorize and label and break it down based upon the presence and absence of this or that in what context. So it's a way to think about— the third is a way to think about just the general state of your mind, your attitude, what these recent thoughts have gained momentum and are doing to your thinking. And then after that, it gets harder. Then there's the Dharmas, which is both your thoughts and using all of these different ways of looking at the world in the teachings, like the Five Aggregates, the hindrances, the Six Sense Bases, the Seven Factors of Awakening, the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, using all of that as a way to break down and deconstruct your thought process and how to redirect it. Why is it? What is it doing? Why is it doing it? And which parts are bad? How to replace it with better versions.

**Speaker A:** That's part of the form, is that we're making an improvement here. All right. So how about you, Paul? Do you have something to say?

**Speaker D:** Nothing to add.

**Speaker G:** It was a good talk. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Simon, did I cover that question that you had about formal meditation? Yes, you did. Makes sense now, just different how I learned.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker G:** I'm starting to understand better.

**Speaker A:** I think possibly that word formal meditation is a Western term. Somebody made that shit up and then it got spread all over the place, kind of as a meme or a form. We don't do a formal meditation, but we do use forms. And when the mind is well skilled, that means that the forms, the scaffolding, can come down, but the cement structure that's left is still in the form of that form.

**Speaker G:** Ta-da!

**Speaker A:** That's what makes it so easy. Jose, do you have something to say? How about you, Dean?

**Speaker H:** Yeah, well, I was the one, sorry for asking the stupid questions, that was me, so apologies.

**Speaker A:** But.

**Speaker H:** Do Arahants do formal meditation? But I know that was it, look, I know now it was a stupid question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a stupid question. The real Arahants, they never heard of the word formal meditation.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker H:** They're too busy having fun. I do have one slight pushback in what you were talking about when you were on about Anapanasati and about not being a breathing exercise. I taught you before, Dhammarato, that I was able to slow down my mind with breathing exercises, and then I would inject the positive thoughts. And you said, wow, well then practice must be going good.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. So let me finish that by repeating what you just said. Your mind was able to slow down and you used your breath to do that. That's why it's not just a breathing meditation, because you can watch your breath from now until Sunday and the mind is just still spinning. Okay, all right. That's the whole point, is, is that yes, breathing is part of the meditation, but it's not the whole thing.

**Speaker G:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, but that is just important then. Like, yeah, look, uh, and anytime I did have success, it was because of There was a breathing meditation involved in my practice, but there was positive thoughts involved as well, 100%.

**Speaker A:** See, so that'll take that new confusion out, and you can go back and start breathing again with having happy, wholesome thoughts, and you'll go right back into that first Jhana again, no problems.

**Speaker G:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** I have a question.

**Speaker G:** Can I ask?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go ahead, Sheep.

**Speaker C:** Sure.

**Speaker G:** Well, my experience, I'm practicing being okay, right? And then I'm being okay. Then what next? You know, like, do I just enjoy.

**Speaker A:** Being in the present? By asking that question, You're not. When you're asking what's next, that means you're not paying attention to what's now. When you can come up with, wow, now is really great, then you don't win anything next. The only reason why we would want something next is because now is not good enough. So when you start asking, well, what's next, the answer to that is let's get now going correctly. We don't have to worry about what's next. Next is always into the future. The question is, can you apply the mind to be happy right now? Practice removing those unwholesome thoughts. In fact, what you can say is, what's next is an unwholesome thought. What's next is actually a doubt.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so when you see those what next questions, you can say, aha, I see you.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, that's happened a lot. Like, oh, I practice being okay now, and then in a while my mind's going to say, hey, what next? It's just like the mind tricking me.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's see. Kernsey, you have something to say.

**Speaker G:** Yes. So I've been thinking that you change the attitude by changing the thoughts. But you said today that you change the thoughts by changing the attitude. So it works both ways, something I didn't realize before.

**Speaker A:** That, um, uh, here's, here's a, a question. Have you ever been to a restaurant or seen in a house they have what is called a kitchen door? Yeah, you know what I mean by a kitchen door? Springs both ways so that the dirty dishes being carried by the waiter can, he can, um put his arm on that door and walk right through into the kitchen. And then later somebody comes to that door from the kitchen. He's carrying new food on a big tray and he could put his arm on that door and walk right into the serving area. So think of that door swinging both ways. Then in fact, if you have a house that's got 4 rooms, the body, the feeling, the mind states, and the mind's objects, think of each room having that kitchen door that swings both ways. So that if you stub your toe, your foot hurts, you have the feeling of I don't like it, you have the attitude of poor me, and then you have thoughts of ouch and I hate that what I kicked. Okay, so there you go. 1, 2, 3, 4. But you can also talk yourself into, "Oh, I just stubbed my toe, but I'm all right." That will gladden the mind, that'll give the feelings back into okay, and then the foot will stop hurting. So you can go backwards through those four states. They all affect one another. The question is, are you going to let that affectation be automatic, or are you going to bring it under your own control? Are you going to put a form on that so that you can actually do what you want to do rather than having it happen automatically?

**Speaker G:** Okay, also got another question. One of my friends recently said it's okay to not be okay. Isn't that kind of a contradiction?

**Speaker A:** Actually, take a frying pan and slap him in the head. Slap him hard. Make him reel and fall back, and then you say, is that okay? I think everybody— it's like saying— he's saying is, uh, he's saying he cannot be okay, and therefore it's okay for him to not be okay, because he's got no practice, he's got no form. Yeah, it's not okay to see not okay.

**Speaker C:** It's fun sometimes to be a victim wallowing in self-pity and say that you're analyzing your past. It's fine. Come on, admit it, you do sometimes.

**Speaker A:** You used to a long time ago. Yeah, but the better thing to do is to see that, aha, I see that I'm victimizing myself. I'm seeing that I'm wallowing in my own self- Piti. I'm having a pity party. Oh, poor me. Let me see if I can find some friends that'll join my pity party. I'll throw them some poisonous snacks and everybody gets sick. But when you see that, you can say, wait a minute, I don't have to do that. I can be okay. So let's use that scaffolding. Let's use those forms to say I'm okay. It's not okay to be not okay. Let's be okay. It's okay to be okay. Because what they're saying is okay to be not okay is exactly the same thing as saying I can't change. Oh, poor me, I can't change. I'll have to put up with being not okay. I'll get used to it.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, thanks.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's it. All right, does anybody else have anything?

**Speaker C:** And then after forms comes the formless Sunyata.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's when we take the scaffolding down. Take those forms away. There's nothing to it then because you're already set.

**Speaker C:** That's graduate level.

**Speaker A:** Well, we're all graduates. That's the form to use, is you've got this, you're already okay.

**Speaker D:** That was Dhammarato at the start. I said if you could talk a little bit about Sunyata. So it was nice that it that came out.

**Speaker A:** Well, the word Sunyata has the quality of absence. There are two suttas. One of them is that in the forest, the village is absent. It's not there. The other one that would be in a sala where the monks would eat, but right now The monks are not there, the bowls are not there, the clamor of eating is not there, this sala is empty. Once you get that concept down, you can begin to see, "Oh, well, my back hurt this morning, but right now that backache is not there." Start looking to see the things that used to be there that are not there now. They changed. This was what Samatha would call wise reflection, to reflect upon the stuff not there now. And when you keep practicing, guess what? There's not all of much of anything there. There's nothing to it.

**Speaker G:** You know, like, I'm sorry, sorry, I I just want to say that when I joined the call, I thought I would keep asking questions, but then I realized why ask questions about this or that, about what is my mind being like this. And, you know, just practice being okay, you know, like just be okay right now. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what we've been telling you, Sheep. You got to be okay. You're already all right.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I'm okay. Look, I'm really happy. Yeah, we practice being okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker G:** So let's ask questions. Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's no reason to ask any questions because you've already got everything you need, which is nothing. So let's continue with that issue of Sunyata for just a little bit. How many of you have ever heard of the concept or the quality of Purpose in life.

**Speaker D:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Purposes, goals. How about meaning? People go around asking, what's the meaning of life? Well, guess what? In and of itself, inherently, life has no meaning other than to be alive, which means then that you are free to create your own delusions about meaning. Or you can leave the meaning empty. There is no meaning. If you have that quality, there is no meaning to life, there is no purpose in life, then you can just really enjoy the moment. But if you think you've got a meaning, if you've got a purpose, that's going to be a little bit unsettling, especially since you're supposed to have a purpose in life, you're supposed to have a meaning in life, and you don't have one. And so that's disconcerting, but it's delusional in the sense that you don't have to have a meaning, you don't have to have a purpose, or choose your own purpose. Either choose it ignorantly or choose it wisely. An example of that is every week now for, gosh, how many years we've been doing this, Probably 5. Is that right, Mikey? We've been doing these calls for 5 years or so.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, not sure, about even longer than that. Yeah, something.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? These calls don't mean anything. They don't mean nothing. What do I mean by that? It means that in this moment right now, we're enjoying this call. Those who are watching it on YouTube, when they're watching it, they're getting some value out of it right then. Maybe some insights, maybe some practice tips, some skills, but really there's nothing to it. Now let's imagine what happens 10,000 years from now, and after Skype and Discord and YouTube and internets and all of that stuff is wiped away and there's nothing left of that kind of stuff called internet, then what are these videos going to be? They're nothing. They don't exist. They're gone. Are you okay with that? In other words, can you enjoy this moment? Because that's all you have. There is no real future. The future is yet to come. And that's where this issue of Sunyata really helps us to understand that right now is all we've got. Right now is all there is. Let's make the best of this moment right now, because that's all there is. There is no meaning to life. There is no Judgment Day. There is no purpose. Westerners have the purpose of money. In fact, I've heard the joke of the guy who dies with the most toys wins. Death itself, there's no winning to it. You can either be miserable for the rest of your life and then die, or you can be joyful for the rest of your life and then die. But your joy or your misery doesn't mean nothing.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, I can see that there is no purpose to life and there is no meaning. I have been thinking a lot about that. And I am the conclusion that there is no purpose and there is no meaning. But instead of becoming— Is that liberating.

**Speaker A:** Or is that full of doubt?

**Speaker D:** No, no, it's not liberating. So for me, it's like, okay, then why not? I'm not suicidal, but then I'm at the moment saying, okay, then why not kill myself? If there is no purpose, no meaning, why live?

**Speaker A:** Well, the answer to that is, why would you? And if— and let's look at it this way. Can you have fun killing yourself? Can you have fun? Let us say that you've jumped out of a plane that's at 10,000 feet, no parachute, and now we're looking, oh wow, that's beautiful, oh, I can see your house from here. One big step. Can you enjoy the free fall, the flying? Can you enjoy that? Because that first step is a big one, but when you land, there may be nothing left. So why not enjoy the nothingness that you can enjoy while you can still enjoy, because when you're dead, the ability to enjoy, the ability to see, is gone. So why kill yourself? Why not enjoy? And if you are going to kill yourself, can you enjoy doing that? Can you get your kitchen table out and say, okay, I've got a bottle of arsenic, I got a bottle of Old Lace, I've got a bottle of saccharin, or I've got a bottle of cyanide, which one am I going to take? Let's mix them together. Let's do a mix and match.

**Speaker D:** The thing is, I don't understand why is it so important to enjoy and.

**Speaker A:** Then to— Well, that's your choice. My choice would be to enjoy. Looks like you're having the choice and you might be stuck in it. That might be an old form of you're supposed to not enjoy life. But you've got a choice. Let's do a poll. Anybody here have the choice that they're going to enjoy their life? See, show of hands. Yeah, look at you, you're being outvoted there, Kawan. We got a whole bunch of people who are going to choose to enjoy their life.

**Speaker D:** I also want that. It is not that I don't want that, but it is just like I'm saying, if it is already so empty and meaningless and no purpose, and then even joy, what is then the purpose of joy?

**Speaker A:** There's no purpose to it. That's the whole point. Even the joy is empty, but you still got a choice. You still got a choice. Your choice: are you going to enjoy your moment, or are you going to be miserable in your moment? Because your misery is your old bad habit. You practice that well. Now it's time for a new style, a new form, a new skill to be developed— the skill of feeling safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. And with that arises great joy.

**Speaker D:** But the thing is, I'm still seeing joy as a means to an end instead of the end itself.

**Speaker A:** There is no end. Or better still, there actually— there is only means, there is no end. Yes, go ahead, Santiago.

**Speaker F:** I think there is one thing.

**Speaker G:** Though.

**Speaker F:** You have Dukkha. You might not have Dukkha right now, but you have Dukkha, right? So then it says the work that has to be done is the one that you can't escape yourself from.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** You, you know, you're here, you got the Dukkha. How are you gonna, you know, you gotta do the work to clear it out. All right guys. Even though there is Sunyata, that's a momentary purpose in that sense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so when you're cleaning that out, you're actually saying, aha, I see you, Mara, I see you, and I can throw you out too, happily. Almost everybody is raised miserably. I would say that there's an actual contest going on between Christianity and Islam as to who can raise the most miserable children. And I think Islam has won.

**Speaker D:** The thing is, the culture which has been growing, being happy is not something important.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not important. But your misery is not important. Your misery is not important. Your surrender is not important. Nothing is important. Everything is empty, remember? And life's got no meaning. But you have choices, and most people, once they understand that they've got a choice, will choose to be happy. Give it a go, try it out.

**Speaker D:** I'm trying, I'm doing that.

**Speaker A:** So I see a smile already.

**Speaker D:** I'm just asking questions just to really, um, yeah, make it really sink in.

**Speaker C:** I would say that if you don't want to be happy, most people want to, to a fault. That's the other problem Americans have. They have the right to the pursuit of happiness, right? So they pursue it to no end. They never get it, maybe, but they pursue happiness. If happiness is not important for you, that's fine. That's your choice. But please have some compassion for the people around you because you're leaking on everyone when you live your life in misery and suffering. Stress and frustration and irritation. So either go away or clean up and stop leaking on everyone else.

**Speaker A:** That's very well said, Chris. Very well said.

**Speaker E:** All I can think of is like what a relief it is that there is no meaning, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the meaning of life— there is no meaning.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, what a relief.

**Speaker A:** What a relief that is. Wow, what a relief.

**Speaker D:** You said that life has no meaning. Okay. But what if we try to enjoy every moment of the life and also try to live for the greater, great purpose? Is it possible?

**Speaker A:** Well, I have a purpose. If you have a purpose, that means that you're taking on an assignment. You're supposed to live up according to your purpose. If there is no purpose, wow, what a relief it is! That means that I can just relax. Wow, what a relief it is! No place to go and nothing to do. But if you've got a purpose, you've got a meaning, that means you've got someplace to go and something to do. Whether you like it or not.

**Speaker G:** Uh, I got a question to ask you a little bit. Well, uh, well, I'm practicing okay, right? But the present is changing, you know, like for example when you feel like maybe you feel something happening and it's shrinking. And.

**Speaker A:** But that's just a concept. A shrinking is something that you're doing in the mind. Can you see that and say, aha, I see myself shrinking?

**Speaker G:** Shrinking, shrinking, like, like I feel something else, you know.

**Speaker I:** He's saying changing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's changing.

**Speaker A:** Change it. Yes, change it. Change it to the wholesome. Change it to happy. Change it to whatever you want. But it's like, so she— how would you feel right now if you could feel just the way you wanted to feel? How could you feel the way you wanted to feel?

**Speaker G:** I would feel happy.

**Speaker A:** All right, so feel happy.

**Speaker G:** Okay, I— But you're not.

**Speaker A:** I hear it in your voice. You haven't felt happy yet.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** I'm just not sure what to do. Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure what to do. I practice being okay, right? But then the present, the right now, I feel something else.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, note that feeling and make a change. Change it to feeling okay, safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied. This is a change.

**Speaker D:** But then where.

**Speaker G:** Is it going to end?

**Speaker A:** It's not. Only you are going to end, and you can either— you end now, or you can keep that you until you die. But even then, it's going to end. You're going to end, which means it all meaning All feeling, everything is going to end. Knowing that everything is temporary, you have a choice right now as to being the way you want to be right now, knowing that it's going to come to an end. And yet you practice being not okay so much of the time because that's an old habit. But you can see that old habit and say, hey, I don't have to feel that way, I can feel the way I want to feel.

**Speaker G:** That's, uh, it's just— oh man, I always have excuse.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've heard you. You've always got some stupid excuse to not practice. I practice what we call doubt. Stupid excuses is just another word for doubt. So stop with your stupid excuses. See your stupid excuses and say, I don't have to have stupid excuses. I can just be okay.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I can be okay right now. Even this feeling, you know, like.

**Speaker D:** Change.

**Speaker A:** That even by changing the attitude. I'm okay. When you change your attitude, I'm okay, that's going to change your feeling.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. So Mikey, this has been going on for a while. Why don't we take this thing home?

**Speaker I:** Yeah, thank you, friends, for being here today. One thing I did want to touch on is, yeah, build that enthusiasm. Practice having enthusiasm for the practice. It may seem hard or difficult sometimes, but And the same way a difficult chess game can be fun, or a difficult video game, or a difficult piece of music we might be learning can be enjoyable, the practice can be enjoyable too. We don't have to see the difficulty as haunting or daunting. It's okay. Yeah, you have these things, these thoughts, these worries that come back over and over and over again. Be enthusiastic to throw that Dukkha out and enjoy throwing it out. It makes this game that we're playing a whole lot easier, really a whole lot more effortless. So yeah, if you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and hit the subscribe, hit the like button, leave a comment. We're also on Apple and Spotify. And you can follow us there as well. We've been posting these— yeah, Podbean. We've been posting these Sangha calls much closer to when we actually record them. So yeah, go check them out. And if there's something you missed, give this one a re-listen. It can be really worthwhile to do that. And that was one thing I also wanted to mention is Yeah, there's maybe no meaning or no purpose, but we can say it's worthwhile to practice. It brings quite a bit of benefit to ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Great fruit. The Buddha uses the term great fruit. Great fruit. Anapanasati brings great fruit. And one of the great fruits that it brings is enthusiasm. I'm glad you mentioned that. I've been enthusiastic for nearly this whole hour. Anybody picked up on that? Santiago, have you seen the enthusiasm in action? Yeah, how about you, Paul? Rick, you see that enthusiasm? So thank you for mentioning it, um, Mikey. Bring some enthusiasm. Is joyful. Eagerness. Become eager for the Dharma, because with that eagerness brings delight, great joy. So thank you all for coming. We'll see you. We'll see you. Got a lot of new friends here. Thank you all.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on redefining **"formal meditation"** by focusing on the concept of **"form"** as a mental structure for practice, rather than external rituals or postures.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Metaphor: Form as a Scaffold or Mold**
Dhammarato uses the analogy of **wet cement needing a form (mold) to set into a desired structure**. Similarly, the mind needs a clear, intentional structure ("form") to develop wholesome habits. Once the skill is internalized (the cement dries), the external form can be removed. Other analogies include:
*   A **cast for a broken bone** – to immobilize and allow healing.
*   **Scaffolding** for a building – used during construction, then removed.
*   A **musical instrument** – you must practice on the correct instrument (e.g., piano) to develop that specific skill.

### **Redefining "Formal Practice"**
*   The common Western idea of "formal meditation" (retreats, specific postures, altars, incense) is secondary. These are external trappings.
*   **True "form" is internal:** It is the **mental framework** you consciously apply to guide your mind.
*   **Correct practice means using correct mental forms**, not just holding the body still.

### **The Correct Mental Forms for Practice**
The talk emphasizes using specific, wholesome mental forms aligned with the Buddha's teachings:
1.  **For the Mind (State/Attitude):** The form of **gladdening, brightening, and uplifting the mind**. Shifting from a "victim" mindset to "I can handle this; I'm okay."
2.  **For Feelings:** The form of **safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction** (*sukkha*).
3.  **For Mind Objects (Thoughts):** The form of **cultivating only wholesome thoughts** and systematically replacing unwholesome ones.
4.  **Overarching Form:** **Freedom from the Five Hindrances** (sense desire, ill-will, sloth/torpor, restlessness/worry, and doubt). This is the primary form to establish.

### **Key Practice Instructions**
*   **Steer, Don't Stop:** The mind is likened to a giant ship without brakes—you **steer it** (with wholesome forms) rather than trying to stop it completely.
*   **Use the Four Postures Flexibly:** Practice can be done while sitting, walking, standing, or reclining. Physical stillness is useful but not the essence.
*   **Practice in Seclusion:** Initially, distance from distracting and unwholesome influences helps maintain the mental form.
*   **Repetition is Key:** Like strengthening a neurological pathway, you repeatedly return to the wholesome form (e.g., "I'm okay") until it becomes the new habit.
*   **The Role of *Satipatthana* (Four Foundations of Mindfulness):** The practice of Ānāpānasati is a complete system applying these forms to **body, feelings, mind state, and mind objects**. They dynamically influence each other (like swinging doors between rooms).

### **Clarifications on Key Concepts**
*   **Saṅkhāra:** Translated as "formations," it is better understood as a **disorganized "pile of junk"** (past conditioning). Practice involves organizing this into a wholesome, structured "library."
*   **Form vs. Formless:** When the mental skill is fully developed and stable, the "scaffolding" of the form can be removed, leading to a natural, effortless state (hinting at *suññatā* – emptiness).
*   **Purpose of Joy:** In a discussion on life's meaning (*suññatā*), the point is made that while life may have no inherent meaning or purpose, we have a **choice**. We can choose the wholesome form of **joy and satisfaction** in the present moment, as it alleviates suffering for oneself and others.

### **Conclusion**
The talk reframes practice from performing a "formal meditation" to **skillfully applying specific mental forms**—primarily gladdening the mind and cultivating satisfaction—as outlined in the suttas (like MN 118, Ānāpānasati). The goal is to internalize these forms so that wholesome states become the mind's default setting, at which point the deliberate "form" is no longer needed. The emphasis is on **practical, correct practice** that leads to happiness here and now, not on external appearances.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the concept of "form" in meditation practice and to correct misconceptions about "formal" meditation. Here are the key ones:

### **Primary Metaphor: Building with Wet Cement/Concrete**
*   **The Core Analogy:** Developing a skill (like meditation) is like pouring wet cement. Without a **form** (a mold or structure), the cement just spreads uselessly. The form gives it the desired shape (e.g., a column, sidewalk). Once the cement sets and dries, the form can be removed, leaving the solid structure behind.
*   **Application:** In meditation, the "form" is the specific mental structure or framework we use to train the mind (e.g., a specific attitude, feeling, or thought pattern). We repeat it until it "sets" as a new habit. Once the skill is internalized, the strict "form" is no longer needed.

### **Supporting Metaphors and Analogies:**

1.  **Construction Scaffolding:** Building a structure requires scaffolding (the form). Workers use it to assemble the building, and then it's removed once the building is complete. Similarly, mental forms are temporary supports for building a wholesome mind.

2.  **Medical Cast for a Broken Bone:** A broken bone must be set in a **cast** (a form) to immobilize it so it can heal properly. The mind, prone to unwholesome habits, also needs a "cast" to immobilize it in a wholesome state so it can "heal" and develop new patterns.

3.  **Learning a Musical Instrument:** You can't learn to play the piano by holding a clarinet. You need the **correct form** (a piano) to develop the correct skill. Similarly, you need the correct mental "form" (e.g., gladdening the mind) to develop wholesome mental states, not just any arbitrary posture or ritual.

4.  **Steering a Ship (Aircraft Carrier):** The mind is like a massive ship that **cannot be stopped** abruptly; it has no brakes. The practice is not about "stopping the mind" but about **steering** it in the right direction using the "forms" as a rudder.

5.  **A Library's Organizational System (vs. a Pile of Junk):**
    *   **Samskara (Misunderstood):** The speaker argues that translating *samskara* as "formation" is misleading. A better metaphor is a **disorganized pile of junk** or books thrown on the floor—chaotic and useless.
    *   **The Goal of Practice:** We need to organize this "pile" by putting up shelves and using a system like the **Dewey Decimal System (a form)**. This means systematically cataloging and choosing wholesome memories, thoughts, and attitudes instead of letting in mental "junk" willy-nilly.

6.  **The Bucket and Its Contents:** The mind's state is like a **bucket**, and thoughts are what's inside it. If the bucket (mind) is dirty and rusty, it taints whatever is inside. Polishing the bucket (brightening/glađening the mind) makes everything in it better.

7.  **The Swinging Kitchen Door:** The four foundations of mindfulness (body, feelings, mind state, mind objects) are like rooms connected by **double-swinging kitchen doors**. Each affects the others bidirectionally. Stubbing a toe (body) can lead to pain (feeling), a victim attitude (mind state), and angry thoughts (mind objects). Conversely, changing your thoughts can change your attitude, which changes your feelings.

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Prize Fighters:** After a fight, the **winner and loser** get massages. The winner has thoughts of victory and success, while the loser has thoughts of being a victim. This illustrates how a **mind state** (winner vs. loser) directly determines the **mind's objects** (the subsequent thoughts).

2.  **The Child Asking Endless Questions:** Some people are raised in the "form" of constant questioning and doubt. They get stuck in a loop of asking questions without ever settling into practice. The form needs to be changed from "doubt" to "gladdening the mind."

3.  **Freud's Free Association:** This is given as a counter-example. Free association is a **lack of form**—letting the mind jump randomly. In contrast, the practice is about applying a form to move **systematically from one wholesome thought to the next**.

4.  **The Person Trying to Drive with a "Stopped Mind":** The speaker mocks the impractical idea of a completely silent mind. If your mind were truly stopped, you couldn't function—you couldn't even start a car. This story highlights that the goal is **skillful steering, not annihilation**.

5.  **The "It's Okay to Not Be Okay" Friend:** A brief story about a friend who uses this phrase. The speaker reframes this as a defeatist "form" that accepts misery. The correct form is to say, "It's **not** okay to be not okay; I can change this."

### **Overall Narrative:**
The talk itself tells a **story of correction**. It starts with a student's question about "formal meditation" and then **deconstructs the Western/ritualistic notion of "formal."** It replaces it with the idea of a **skill-building "form,"** using the metaphors above to illustrate how these mental forms are built, used, and eventually transcended, leading to a mind that is naturally wholesome, joyful, and organized—like a well-built structure or a curated library.
