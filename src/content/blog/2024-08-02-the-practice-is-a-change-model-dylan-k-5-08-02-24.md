### Transcript


**Speaker A:** You've gotten down to the basic point. You want, you want, you want. You want to remember. And as I've just said, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. And if you've forgotten— not have you lost it, but you forgot that you lost it— now you're free. Now, one of the things that people will say is that, "Oh, I'm sure that I've lost track of an assignment, or an appointment, or an obligation, or something that needs to be done." But that too is just a feeling. Whatever it was, it doesn't matter anyway. So when you have that feeling, that sensation of something's missing, and I got to go figure out what it was, the best thing to do is to say, "Oh, I've got that feeling that something is missing, but never mind, I'm okay right now.".

**Speaker B:** What about the feeling that nothing matters, as you mentioned?

**Speaker A:** Right, nothing really matters except when you want something. That's what matters to us, is what we want. And if you don't want anything, then nothing matters. Which brings along that famous quote, that mind over matter. Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter. So you mind it, you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** So you need to accept that nothing matters.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** But okay, so let's say I accept nothing matters.

**Speaker A:** Well, one thing does matter. You're taking it all the way to matter. I said it and you're taking it to everything. There is one thing I'll tell you that does matter. Okay, your next breath. And it's hard to forget that.

**Speaker B:** Why does that matter and not anything else?

**Speaker A:** Well, if you don't breathe, there is nothing else now, is there?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So that next breath is the important thing. Can you take the next breath? If it does, then nothing else matters. You're still alive.

**Speaker B:** What if you stop taking the next breath? Like, what if you die?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, if you stop willfully taking the next breath, you'll pass out and then you'll start breathing again.

**Speaker B:** No, but let's say you just stop breathing, you passed away.

**Speaker A:** How about expire? Okay, that's the word for it. Okay, you know what expire means? It means to breathe out. So that used to be a euphemism. Oh, he expired, which means he breathed out, which means he didn't get a new in-breath. It's like passing away. That's just a euphemism. Gone to a better place, that's just an euphemism. He expired. He's no longer with us. The reality is, is that he's died. He's dead. That's the right word for it. Okay, so expired. So what if somebody expires? They're dead. It doesn't matter to them. The only thing that matters is the people who don't want him to be dead. They're wanting something they can't have. If he's dead, he's really dead. And they can't do anything about it, but oh, they can feel bad because they lost something. They lost their doctor, they lost their mommy, they lost their dog, they lost that laptop. Things die. Get over it. Let us say that your mommy died, but you forgot that she died. Then it doesn't matter. Everything is in constant flux, everything is in motion.

**Speaker B:** If nothing matters, that just feels a bit depressing.

**Speaker A:** Well, depression is actually too much matters. Someone who is depressed is actually trying to avoid how bad they really feel. Because they want so much. That in fact, when you get to the state that nothing matters, that's a really happy state. Wow, don't matter nothing. Got no problems, got no worries. Wow, freedom at last.

**Speaker B:** Is that similar to apathy?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Apathy. The state of apathy.

**Speaker A:** No, apathy means that it matters but you feel so bad you're not going to do it. This is not apathetic. This is in fact exactly opposite of apathetic. This is the state where nothing matters, that you can go do anything you want to. You can be joyous, you can be happy, you can get things done, you can go play with stuff. That's basically a good way of talking about it, is that when things are work, when they are hard, then we have the feeling, "Oh, I don't want to do that," and that brings on apathy. But when things are not hard, when things are easy peasy, then you can get stuff done. You enjoy doing it.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] What about in the scenario where I'm working on something.

**Speaker A:** Um, you're waiting on something?

**Speaker B:** No, working. We're working on something.

**Speaker A:** Okay, stop. It's not difficult, but it's time working on things. Unless you're using the word work correctly, but almost nobody I've ever met means work correctly. Most of them, when they say work, they mean work. When they say work, that means a job to do. It's hard work, hard labor.

**Speaker B:** Well, for me, it's, it's a lot of thinking because it's a mind-based occupation, and after thinking, I feel so tired.

**Speaker A:** That's because you want it done. You've got a lot of desire in all of that thinking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And here's the point. When you start to get tired, can you see that you're starting to get tired, or do you have to get completely exhausted, falling over, passing out, before you recognize that you're tired?

**Speaker B:** No, I usually take a break, but I get tired very quickly, I've noticed.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you get tired, so do a little and enjoy yourself, and then take a break and enjoy yourself, and then come back happily and enjoy yourself. Right, but that takes practice because you've been practicing so hard that things matter, that there's work to do. So you're in a hurry to get it done.

**Speaker B:** So when you have, let's say, um, bosses and deadlines and commitments to meet, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, turn those things into Enjoying the moment and forgetting about the deadline, making friends with the boss. Stop seeing him as a boss. If he wants to be uptight about a deadline, that's his business to be uptight about a deadline. You're just having fun here.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Stop having deadlines. Do you know what? In fact, the deadline is a euphemism For if you don't pass it in a certain time, if you pass over that line, you're dead. And businesses have deadlines all the time, and nobody dies. A deadline is a major kind of a goal, a plan, a desire. Stop having those kind of things. Right, you'll do what you do, and if you didn't pass the deadline, so what? Okay, enjoy doing what you're doing. In fact, if you enjoy doing what you're doing, you'll probably get the job done faster than if you spread about, oh, I've got a deadline, oh, I've got to get this done. Because while you're doing what you're doing, coding or writing or whatever it is, you always have those thoughts coming intruding in. I've got to hurry, I've got to get it done, I've got a deadline. And while you're having the thoughts of, "Oh, I've got to get it done, I'm in a hurry, I've got a deadline," those are unproductive moments. Put those thoughts aside and just enjoy what you're doing. Forget about the deadlines. Enjoy what you're doing. And if you did make a deadline while you were enjoying what you're doing, for sure you wouldn't have made that deadline while you were working like hell at it. And some deadlines are inappropriate. Some deadlines are built upon greed. The boss is great, he wants more money, he wants to work you and work you, make you work your tail off so he can get more money, and his bank account is already marvelous. Screw his deadline, I'm having fun here. Wow, you went silent on that one.

**Speaker B:** Um, what are your recommendations on, um, physical unpleasant sensations that arise during meditation, or not even?

**Speaker A:** Well, they're messages. Pay attention to them. I just wrote something about that. Have you ever seen, uh, any of the movies? Uh, you probably haven't spent as much time in India as I have. But one of the practices in India is some guru or some mystic or some Saddha will hold his hand in the air until it atrophies. Have you ever seen that?

**Speaker B:** I think I've seen a photo, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. It's a stupid thing to do. His arm hurts. His arm is telling him, hey, this is inappropriate. So he can drop his arm. Yeah, another thing. Here's something. Is this coffee cup heavy?

**Speaker B:** Depends.

**Speaker A:** Depends on what?

**Speaker B:** How long you hold it for.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And when I set it down, it's not heavy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Exactly so.

**Speaker A:** So put things down. Stop carrying around the heavy burden, like a deadline. Just set it down.

**Speaker B:** What do you do about the sensations, for example, the energetic Kundalini kind of feeling sensations in the body that are unpleasant, that feel deep?

**Speaker A:** Why would you call Kundalini kind of sensations unpleasant?

**Speaker B:** I guess like heat, right? You feel like, I feel heat, for example, around my solar plexus area.

**Speaker A:** Why do you call that Kundalini? Why can't you just call it heat around the solar plexus?

**Speaker B:** Well, I think there's good established terminology around that, that I think it's relevant to.

**Speaker A:** Established by a bunch of idiots then. Let's just stay with with reality. The reality is, is that you have a hotspot in your solar plexus. Forget about chakras, they don't exist except in the minds of holy men who don't know what they're thinking about. And let's stay with what's real about the body, all right? And so the answer to that— we.

**Speaker B:** Have been able to measure it scientifically now, though.

**Speaker A:** Well, forget those scientific— I mean, that all that scientific stuff that you're talking about now is scientific is hogwash. It's not science. It's not double-blind studies. It's not experimented with. Somebody in India just calls himself a scientist so that he can get some credibility, so that he can tell you about some bullshit.

**Speaker B:** Dr. Joe Dispenza, um, don't listen to him.

**Speaker A:** Stay with your own body. Listen and pay attention to your own body. Forget about the scientists. Forget about the nerds. Forget about the charlatans. Forget about all of that terminology and start paying attention to the body. Pay attention to the way you feel.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, start doing the things that you need to do for the body. Like if you have low blood pressure, you already know that salt will work because you've experimented with that. And you know that it's effective. So, and other people have experimented with it, but then somebody at some pharmaceutical company is going to put a bunch of stuff you don't need in it, call it an electrolyte, and sell it to you. Where salt is pretty cheap.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So if you got low blood pressure, take some salt. If you got high blood pressure, stop eating salt.

**Speaker B:** Okay, like, let's say— let's not use the terminology that you don't like using. Um, let's say you have sensations.

**Speaker A:** Random sensations, track changes. You recognize that you're moving around a whole lot. The first thing you said was that you hurt your hip when you fell, when you, um, passed out, then you talk about heat in the chest.

**Speaker B:** Well, we're just talking about a bunch.

**Speaker A:** Of different topics because— Yeah, right, let's not do that. Let's stay on one topic.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what topic did you want to stay on?

**Speaker A:** The ones that you started with. They were obviously important with you. You started them.

**Speaker B:** Right? It's a fair— You jump to something.

**Speaker A:** Else like a monkey, or dropping, you know, jumping around the limbs of a tree.

**Speaker B:** No, I think you gave your answer and you said there wasn't anything more to it, right?

**Speaker A:** What was that? We didn't talk about the chest and the pain and heat in the chest and we really haven't talked about the falling down and hurting your hip.

**Speaker B:** No, I didn't hit my hip, but I did fall down. When we talked about it before, you.

**Speaker A:** Said.

**Speaker B:** That it's mainly just about the attitude, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, it's the real issue is, is can you get back up? Are you paying attention to the sensations of the body? That's the real thing to do, is to start paying attention to all of these sensations, one by one, as they occur.

**Speaker B:** What about situations where you don't have control? For example, what about the times when you don't have that control? For example, you don't have the bodily awareness to deal with, deal or make the, or get out of the Dukkha. For example, let's say you just pass out. Let's say you just have a heart attack. Let's say you just collapse. You don't have the conscious control to change your attitude in that moment.

**Speaker A:** That's the only time you can change your attitude is in this present moment. For instance, in a case like that, I'll let me lay down and rest. Many people who have an attack like that get really uptight, really worried about their death, wanting to get to a hospital as fast as they can, making things a whole lot worse, where the heart's just saying, "Hey, I need a rest." And the funny thing about heart attacks is that they almost always occur in really stressful situations. And so the best thing to do is to be free from stress. If you're free from stress, then you're unlikely to have a heart attack.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Let's not be stressed out. Freedom from stress. Be relaxed.

**Speaker B:** So the real, I guess, answer here is you have to accept whatever is going to happen to you Because ultimately.

**Speaker A:** There'S no— ultimately there is no ultimately. All we ever have is right now. There is no ultimately. That's just a concept.

**Speaker B:** So you have to accept even the things you don't want to happen because you have no control over what could happen.

**Speaker A:** Can you in fact come to the place that you don't mind what happens? Mind over matter again. If you don't mind, it don't matter. Here's where the practice of Anapanasati comes in. In fact, I've been waiting for you to ask the kind of question that I've got real answers for.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that is, what can you do in advance? Okay. And what you can do in advance, right here, right now, is start to practice Right now everything is okay. And when thoughts of, oh well, what about the ultimate? You can say, hot dog, there is no ultimate right now, let me just relax. When you say, oh, I've got work to do, you say, I don't have to do it right now, let me just relax, I'm going to take a deep breath, everything is okay, everything is fine. That's what needs to be practiced, because that's what people have no skills in. They have a whole lot of skills in being uptight. They have a whole lot of skills in having deadlines, and working really hard, and doing stuff for somebody else, not enjoying their life. Western society is highly skilled at that. Some of them are so well skilled at that kind of stuff, their heart attacks them. So the right thing to do is just to rest. Stop making things matter so much. Stop wanting stuff, but just be relaxed. And when you start to see that you want stuff, you can say, hey, wait a minute, right now I don't need it, I'm okay. And start to practice over and over again that right now everything is fine. Right now you're okay. Not a worry in the world. Everything is all right. And so you, you, you pass out, and then you wake up, and there, there you are on the ground. And you can say, hey, how do I feel right now? Am I still drowsy? Let me lay here and rest. Or am I ready to get up? Then hot dog, I can get up now. That's all there is to it. If you have some heat in the chest, you can say, oh, I could feel that. Let me breathe with it. Let me play with it. But if you have heat in the chest, oh no, I've got heat in the chest, oh, what does that mean? That means that it matters. And when you see that it matters, you can say, wait a minute, it's just heat in the chest, never mind, it doesn't matter. Let me experience it. Let me heed its warnings. Let me find out what this is all about by experiencing it. Take a deep breath and just lay and relax. Everything is okay. You can practice that, actually practice it in advance. The Buddha talks about going into seclusion. What that means is that you've got no pressure, you've got no stress on you from the outside world, and so you get away from the world. And then you find out that you've got all that stress and pressure that you brought with you because you were in the habit of having it. And so you lay that aside and start to practice being in a really good state. And if you're well-practiced, have good skills at it, then you can go back to society and not get stressed out by it the way that you were starting when you were a child. You've been spending your whole life being stressed, whole life talking to yourself into feeling bad, whole life wanting stuff. Now it's time to start practicing no stress, practicing deep breath, start to practice everything is okay, everything is fine. And we have to practice, repeat it. Nobody becomes a concert pianist, a world-class human being, into piano by 1 hour of practice when they were 5 years old. They have to practice and practice and practice and practice. A couple of stories about Arthur Rubinstein: One story is that a woman came up to him after a concert and she says, "I would give half of my life to play the piano the way that you do." And he says, "Funny, that's what it cost." And then another story about him is that when he was in his 90s, somebody asked him, does he still practice the piano? And he says, if I miss the piano, if I don't practice one day, I'll know it. And if I miss two days of practice, the housekeeper will know it. And if I miss three days of practice, the dog will know it. Have you ever heard of Arthur Rubinstein? There's probably 50 videos of him playing every concerto that they've got. So if you could see him playing the piano that way, a world-class master, here's a question for you: are you going to become a world-class human being?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Then you have to practice at being a world-class human being. And what is it? Practice. Everything is all right, everything is fine. That's what makes a world-class human being, is the fact that they can handle anything happily. So can you handle this conversation happily?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay. So it's about time you started to smile. Then you start handling everything easily, happily. Everything is all right, everything is hunky-dory, everything is easy peasy, no problems, no worries, no jobs to do, no deadlines, no dead bosses. That the guy that you used to call your boss, now you can start calling him your friend. And in fact, he's probably hurting because he's got a deadline And he tries to give it to you. So you need to practice over and over and over again, like Arthur Rubinstein, like the Buddha, like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Practice being a good fine human being, world-class, fine, everything is okay kind of human being.

**Speaker B:** So for me, I feel like most of the time there's not that much thinking.

**Speaker A:** Most of the time it's not what?

**Speaker B:** Not much thinking, even when there's unpleasant sensations arising.

**Speaker A:** Well, the kind of thought that you are having though is you don't like it. That's a kind of a thought.

**Speaker B:** Well, only in retrospect, but during, in the present moment, I'm not really thinking about it. It's just I'm feeling— You've been thinking.

**Speaker A:** About it quite a lot on this call. You're not watching what you're thinking. This is what I would advise you to do, is to start looking at what you actually are thinking about. You're like most people, you don't even know when you're having unwholesome thoughts. That takes practice, that's a skill to be developed.

**Speaker B:** How would you know that I'm not aware of the unwholesome thoughts?

**Speaker A:** Because you've had me, 4 or 5, maybe 6 or 7 already in this call.

**Speaker B:** Well, then it comes to unwholesome speech. Potentially unwholesome speech, but I'm not thinking before I'm speaking. I'm just speaking right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, maybe it would be a good idea if you started thinking about what you were saying. Then in fact, that's a very, very good exercise, is to start monitoring your speech, just taking certain words out of your vocabulary by being mindful of the kind of language that you use. You want to list of words that you could probably take out of your vocabulary and would help you to be more mindful of what you're doing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right. The word 'try,' top of the list. Be sure that you know how you're using the word 'try,' because almost always the word 'try' means that you expect failure. Instead of 'I'm giving you a new kind of coffee,' the wife will say, 'I'm trying a new cup— I'm trying a new coffee,' and the husband's answer is, 'Is yours 'Kopi is always trying.' 'Your Kopi is always trying' means that he doesn't like it. Okay, so that's the word 'try' for you. The next kind of word you can take out of your vocabulary is 'work.' Another one you can take out would be 'deadline.' Another word you can take out would be hurry. Now the ultimate words to take out would be I, me, and mine. Nothing is worth clinging to as I, me, or mine, and yet that's how we cling to everything. Like, I fell down. Reality is that the body fell down.

**Speaker B:** But in conversation, you can't really say the body fell down.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can. You can change the way you speak. People may ask you what that is, and you can give them a Dhamma lesson.

**Speaker B:** But if it's just words, and it's our interpretation of the words, that's the issue, we can still use the word 'I,' right? Like, 'Oh, I whatever.'.

**Speaker A:** Only in the sense of clarification. In fact, one of the interesting things about the Thai language is that they very rarely use the program 'I.' They don't use the word 'gu.' They don't use the word 'chan' or 'dichan' or 'pom.' for themselves, okay, that they can get by with that. Like for instance, uh, uh, uh, going to town is different from going to town. You hear the difference? Okay, don't have to use a program, uh, pronoun. Are you going to town? Because you can just say going to town with that rising tone at the end for the question. Are going to town. That hard going indicates who's going to town. So you can begin to— or another way of saying it, it's possible to begin to not using pronouns. If you look, if looking is done— see, I've got two different ways of saying it. I've got two different ways of saying it. There are two different ways of saying it, but we are in such a habit, or that the habit there exists in Western culture of using pronouns— I, me, and mine— with the resultant built-in clinging. So there's a list: try hard, work, hurry, deadline, I, me, and mine.

**Speaker B:** Maybe should as well.

**Speaker A:** Should is another. Should, ought, would, could. Changing the subject, which is generally referred to as a whataboutism. An example of that would be, "The Democrats did this," and the Republican stood up and says, "What about that?" Instead of addressing the topic, "The Republicans did this," instead of going with "did this," they want to change the topic: "Well, what about that?" So, when Donald Trump is confronted, he'll say, "Well, what about Hillary Clinton?" Changing the topic. So staying on topic, that's another way that you can deal with your speech. Become mindful of what you're saying will help you, will help anyone become more mindful of the thoughts that you have.

**Speaker B:** At the same time, a topic changes when one or both parties desires to change the topic. It doesn't have to be structured.

**Speaker A:** Well, that desire is what I'm talking about. If you don't have any desires, then you don't have to change the topic. You can finish. What if you just— That's the whataboutism. Changing the topic means you don't want to talk about the topic that's at hand.

**Speaker B:** It could be that it's naturally come to a conclusion.

**Speaker A:** Or that it's desire. You know that you've gotten into the style here in this conversation of rebutting everything I say. You're in the habit actually right now of doing, well, what about this and what about that, called a whataboutism. Yeah, I understand, because I don't agree.

**Speaker B:** Or I am trying to understand your point of view better. And it's helpful to go through a variety of contexts.

**Speaker A:** No, it's helpful to ask for clarification.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Rather than going off topic.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, you felt that I was going off topic?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, going here and going there.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I wasn't going off topic. If you don't like to engage in conversation that way, I can change my speech for you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's try that, because it will be of enormous value for you to start paying attention to the way that you talk. So yeah, let's make some changes. That's what the real teaching of the Buddha is all about, is let's make some changes here. Let's change the way that we think. Let's change the way that we talk. Let's come out of our unhappiness, our whataboutisms, our work-to-dos, and start coming into the state of everything is okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world. Everything is just fine. It has to be practiced, because the normal mind just jumps all over the place. That's why, for centuries, I thought, in fact, in the beginning, that Goenka had made it up when he used the term monkey mind. Come to find out, it's many centuries old. What is a monkey mind? Jumps from here to there to there to there to there to there, topic after topic. Another way of talking about it is rambling, whataboutisms, etc. And all topic at hand is, can we change for the better? Can we come out of all of that rambling, come out of all of that jumping around, come all about out of that 'what about this' and 'what about that' and stay on topic?

**Speaker B:** Why is staying on topic better?

**Speaker A:** Staying on topic is better because you're liable to get some value out of it by staying on topic. For instance, if you're— I don't know what your job is. You said you had to do a lot of thinking about it. All right, so when you start thinking about your job, and then you think about Aunt Susie, then you think about this call, then you think about the deadline, and then you think about your boss, and then you think about what's happening for supper, you're not getting on topic.

**Speaker B:** Right. So how do you know when the topic has run its course or that the topic deserves changing?

**Speaker A:** One by one as they occur generally happens from the outside, but monkey mind happens on the inside.

**Speaker B:** Can you explain more on that, this happens from the outside?

**Speaker A:** Yes, if your boss comes up to ask you a question, it's better to stay on topic and answer his question in great detail rather than he asks you a question and you change the subject. Well, what about that guy over there? He's not getting it done either. He's changing the topic.

**Speaker B:** So this is a scenario when the external is changing for you, but what about a situation the opposite? For example, you are the one leading the team, or you are the one talking to somebody else, so you are setting the frame, you don't have the frame imposed on you, so you have to decide when the topic starts and ends because you don't have somebody else that's deciding that externally for you.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So how does one figure that out?

**Speaker A:** Actually, that is the skill that would be developed, the skill of staying on topic. For instance, Anapanasati is the skill of watching the thoughts and keep changing them back to happy, wholesome thoughts. Then the mind wanders away again, off topic. Come back, see that. In fact, I could go so far as to say that some people call that concentration. Other people use another word for concentration. But a way of using the word concentration correctly is you keep coming back to the topic, and keep coming back to the topic, and keep coming back, keep practicing. For instance, the kid who was there practicing the piano was chewing on his fingernails; he's not practicing the piano. Practicing the piano is practicing the piano, and kids can find 30 things to do while they were not practicing piano. Staying on topic is practicing piano. Monkey mind is going off in someplace else. So a good boss has the ability to stay on topic. Bad bosses just jerk their people around because they're not staying on topic. So the topic would be, can you feel good? Can you feel happy? Are you okay? Can you stay on topic? Never mind, start again. You drop off a topic, oh, never mind, start again. Let's go back to the topic. Just keep coming back and coming back over and over and over again, coming back to the topic, because there's very few topics that are really worth talking about. Very, very few topics we're talking about. Here's an example of that. Truth is true. A lie can be all over the place. A lie is like changing the topic, but the truth is just the truth. Here's an example. How old are you?

**Speaker B:** 26.

**Speaker A:** Now lie to me. How old are you?

**Speaker B:** 38.

**Speaker A:** Now lie to me, how old are you?

**Speaker B:** 38.

**Speaker A:** Now lie to me, how old are you?

**Speaker B:** 37.

**Speaker A:** Now lie to me, how old are you?

**Speaker B:** 120.

**Speaker A:** All right, now lie to me again, how old are you?

**Speaker B:** 8 billion years.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so see, there's no end to how many different ways that you can get off topic.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** The number of lies that you can tell is all over the place. That's why there's so many different religions, because every one of them is so full of crap. And the crap is almost endless. But the reality is, is everybody goes to religion because they're hurting and want to stop hurting. And that's the teaching of the Buddha, is coming out of your hurting. And how do we do that? Is by practicing staying on topic. And what is the topic? Coming out of the hurting, changing. Everything is okay, no hurting here.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Like I said, very few topics are worth talking about. Reality Now here's something that's not worth talking about: ultimate reality. Okay, here's something we're talking about: here, now. What's not worth talking about? The universe, because we're not in the universe, we're in the here-now. The universe is all over the place. So talk about what's real, what's here now. That'll help you stay on topic.

**Speaker B:** I feel like that's diving into philosophy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, don't go into philosophy. Stay right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Even that's a philosophy, right?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Even saying don't do that or do that is a philosophy, right? Compared to a set of practices.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Right, because philosophy is something that they don't practice. In fact, the old, old philosophers, like Socrates and Diogenes and Herodotus and Lao Tzu, were philosophers in a particular way, because they practiced their philosophy. But modern philosophy is all about reading about dead philosophers. Especially those that died 3, 2, 4, 100 years ago, and those philosophers didn't practice philosophy, they just thought about it. So there's two different, real different ways of thinking about it, maybe three. There's three philosophies: one is change, to stay on topic; the other kind of philosophy is to philosophize; And then the third kind of philosophy is to read about dead philosophers. That's modern philosophy.

**Speaker B:** So Buddha was a philosopher, you would say?

**Speaker A:** I would say of course not, absolutely not. For one thing, the word philosophy didn't even exist in the time of the Buddha or Socrates. They just did stuff. Doing it happily, coming out of one's unhappiness, seeing the way things really are. And that takes practice. Look how many people get degrees in philosophy, and look at almost every one of them still is unhappy, just like everybody else. Their philosophy, years of study of philosophy, hasn't helped him at all. Philosophy is about as dead as religion. Philosophy is about as dead, in fact, as psychology. People don't get help with that stuff. What helps is when they start seeing for themselves that they can make a change change right here, right now, in this present moment, to come out of their philosophy, to come out of their religion, and start seeing things the way that they really are. And right now, the way things really are is that I'm happy, I'm having a ball, living in paradise. Everything is great right now. But that's the change that one needs to make, is to come out of their philosophies, to come out of their unwholesome thoughts, to come out of their jumping around and changing topic, come out of their 'what about this' and 'what about that'-isms, and to come and stay. Everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no place to go, nothing to do. I'm satisfied the way things are. Can you say that? No, you've got so many dissatisfactions, you've got so many curiosities, you've got so many questions, so many doubts, and you can come out of all of that stuff and say everything's just fine just the way it is. Unanswered questions can remain unanswered questions, and I'm just okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm okay if they're unanswered, but I also am okay with asking them, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, asking questions is doubt. It's not only doubt, but built into that doubt is dissatisfaction with the lack of knowledge. People want to know.

**Speaker B:** Can you be curiously happy?

**Speaker A:** Can you? A better thing to say is that curiosity is the cure for doubt.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm curious then. I'm not doubting.

**Speaker A:** Well, when you say that you're curious when you're smiling, I believe you. But when you say you're curious when you're frowning and unhappy, I don't believe it. I think that you're full of doubt and worry and anxiety and wanting to know.

**Speaker B:** If I'm frowning, It's okay because I've accepted I'm frowning.

**Speaker A:** Maybe it would be good then for you to watch this video.

**Speaker B:** Maybe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe so. Maybe you can reflect upon— after we've had this conversation, you can go back and review the way that you've behaved, see it from a different perspective.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll do that.

**Speaker A:** You study it from the perspective of justifying your actions and behaviors. You can see it from the perspective of, "Look how much I'm resisting just being happy." Then in fact, you don't have to be curious, you can just be satisfied. You don't have to know the answer to the questions. Our society, though, puts people through school with the position of, or they begin to learn that, "Oh, they've got to know. I've got a test coming up. I've got to know. I've got to know the answers." That's Dukkha. Wanting to know and not knowing is Dukkha. You're dissatisfied. People in general are dissatisfied. They're in doubt. They worry. They change the topic. And the right topic is, I don't need to know that stuff. I'm okay already. Things are just fine the way that they are. This is why we practice going into seclusion, is to get away from all that input so that we can recognize how much crap that we already have, old input that we keep regurgitating over and over again. We can stop doing that, come out of the habit of thinking the same thoughts that we've been thinking for years. And start thinking some new thoughts, wholesome thoughts, thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Wow, what a relief it is. Ah, relax, relax. Those are wholesome. It puts us into a state of satisfaction. Everything is just fine. No dangers, no problems. So you can feel safe and secure. People who want to know feel unsafe without the knowledge. Can you see your discomfort and your fear? Fear of the unknown, what we're talking about. Well, I don't know, but I'm not afraid. I don't have to be afraid of the unknown. But look how much of that is built into our language. Like, better the devil you know than the devil you don't. So people are afraid of the unknown. The unknown never hurt anybody. The only thing that'll ever hurt you is what you already know. So leave the unknown as unknown. It doesn't matter. What matters is, can you come back to this present moment? Everything is fine. I don't have to worry about anything. No questions asked. Satisfied. Ah, relaxed. So my question is, can you start to practice.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have been practicing.

**Speaker A:** Well, you haven't. All right, never mind, start again. Just keep practicing. Are you sure that when you're practicing, you're not practicing whatever you're thinking about, but rather you're practicing to see what you're thinking about and make a change to it? Yes, back to everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. That's what the practice is. The practice is a change model. That's all there is to it, is to come back being okay. Pay attention, watch, wise attention. Pay attention to those thoughts, pay attention to the feelings, pay attention to the body. And especially pay attention to your attitude. And wanting to know is a victim's attitude. Oh, I'll be better off if I know. No, you won't. You can know that and 10,000 other things, and you're still not happy. You're still a victim because you, even though you've gathered information, you haven't changed your attitude. But changing the attitude of everything's okay, everything is fine And you're much better off with the attitude of everything is just fine and hunky-dory than you are with 10,000 pieces of information. You don't need to study how to practice. You don't need to ask 10,000 questions about how to practice. What you instead need to do is to practice. Over and over and over again to see those thoughts as unwholesome. So never mind, I'm okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. So that's the way to practice, come into that state of Hot dog, I can handle anything. I got this. I can do that. Can you do that? Can you start to practice? Can you change? All right, so let's do some changing.

**Speaker B:** Let's do it.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's finish off now. We'll take up a couple of points. One is, when are you going to call back?

**Speaker B:** I'll call next week.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you next week. Be sure to practice being happy. Let's come back on and be happy, okay?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. The second one, have you signed up for the Open Sangha Foundation?

**Speaker B:** The website? I've— yes, I've made a login. If that's what you're referring to.

**Speaker A:** All right, so go spend some time there. It's wholesome. Go find some centers around you. Go find some of the blogs. Go see some of the PDF files. We got so much. We've got a whole Bhikkhuni page that shows almost all the Bhikkhunis in the world. Got lots of articles. Got a lot of links to a lot of websites. So don't be a monkey jumping around from website to website. Stay on topic. Stay on the Open Sangha Foundation website until you learn it well.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Thank you, Dhammarato. All right, have a good one.

**Speaker A:** Have a good moment. Smile.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a core principle: **freedom from suffering comes from letting go of wanting and the attitude that things "matter."** The discussion is a practical, often pointed, dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B) who raises common objections and scenarios.

Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### Core Teaching: "If you don't mind, it don't matter."
*   **Freedom is "nothing left to lose":** True freedom arises when you stop clinging to desires, obligations, and even knowledge. The feeling that something is missing is just a feeling; you can acknowledge it and let it go by affirming, "I'm okay right now."
*   **What truly matters:** The only thing that concretely matters is **the present moment and your next breath**. Everything else (deadlines, bosses, past, future) is a mental construct that causes stress when you want it to be different.
*   **Not Apathy, but Joyful Freedom:** This state is the opposite of depression or apathy. Depression comes from *too much* mattering (wanting). When nothing matters, you are free to act joyfully, playfully, and effectively without the burden of "work," hurry, or pressure.

### Practical Applications & Instructions:
1.  **Reframe Your Attitude:** Continuously practice the thought: **"Right now, everything is okay. Everything is fine."** This is the foundational practice for becoming a "world-class human being" who can handle anything happily.
2.  **Deconstruct "Work" and Deadlines:**
    *   See "work" as an opportunity to enjoy the task itself. Forget the deadline; it's a euphemism that creates stress.
    *   If you have a boss, see them as a friend who is themselves caught in stress. Do your task enjoyably, without internalizing their pressure.
3.  **Handle Sensations & Problems:**
    *   See physical or emotional sensations (pain, heat, tiredness) as **messages**, not problems. Investigate them with curiosity, breathe with them, and heed their warnings (e.g., rest if tired).
    *   Reject complex metaphysical terminology (e.g., Kundalini, chakras). Stick to the direct reality of bodily sensations.
    *   In extreme scenarios (e.g., a heart attack), the practice done *in advance*—cultivating a stress-free, accepting attitude—is what prevents or mitigates the crisis. In the moment, the attitude is: "Let me rest. How do I feel right now?"
4.  **Cultivate Mindfulness of Speech & Thought:**
    *   **Eliminate "unwholesome" words** from your vocabulary that imply stress, obligation, or self-importance: **try, work, hurry, deadline, should, I/me/mine.**
    *   **Avoid "whataboutism"**—jumping from topic to topic (monkey mind). This stems from a desire to avoid the present topic. **Stay on topic** to gain depth and value.
    *   Speaking mindfully helps you see your thoughts. Most people are unaware of their own unwholesome thoughts (wanting, doubting, worrying).

### The Path is Practice:
*   This is not philosophy to be debated, but a **"change model"** to be practiced relentlessly, like a concert pianist practices scales.
*   The goal is to change your **attitude**, not gather more information. Curiosity is often disguised doubt and dissatisfaction.
*   **Seclusion** (removing external pressure) is valuable to see and discard the internal stress you habitually carry.
*   The ultimate skill is **"wise attention"**: noticing your thoughts and feelings, and consciously changing them back to "Everything is okay. I am satisfied. I am relaxed."

### Dynamic of the Talk:
The talk is a live demonstration of the teaching. Dhammarato repeatedly guides Speaker B back from abstract questions ("what about the ultimate?") to the present moment, challenges his defensive speech patterns, and highlights how his questions often stem from a resisting, wanting mind rather than a genuine practice of acceptance. The conclusion is a direct assignment: **practice being happy, and stay on the wholesome topic of your own development.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a few **stories** to illustrate their points about mindfulness, desire, and mental freedom.

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **"Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose."**
    *   **Source/Reference:** A direct quote from the song "Me and Bobby McGee" (popularized by Janis Joplin).
    *   **Use in Talk:** The speaker twists its meaning. True freedom comes not from having nothing, but from forgetting what you've lost or what you think you need. When you forget your attachments ("you forgot that you lost it"), you are free.

2.  **"Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter."**
    *   **Use in Talk:** This is presented as a core principle. Suffering (*dukkha*) arises from "minding"—resisting or disliking what is. If you stop resisting (don't mind), then the situation ceases to be a problem (doesn't matter).

3.  **The Heavy Coffee Cup**
    *   **The Metaphor:** "Is this coffee cup heavy? ... Depends on how long you hold it for. And when I set it down, it's not heavy."
    *   **Use in Talk:** Represents burdens, obligations, and stressful thoughts (like deadlines). The weight isn't in the thing itself, but in our prolonged mental engagement with it. The solution is to "put things down" mentally.

4.  **Monkey Mind**
    *   **The Metaphor:** The mind that jumps from topic to topic, thought to thought, like a monkey swinging from branch to branch.
    *   **Use in Talk:** Used to describe unfocused, restless thinking and conversation ("whataboutism"). The practice is to tame the "monkey mind" and learn to stay on a single, wholesome topic.

5.  **"Deadline" as a Euphemism**
    *   **The Metaphor:** The speaker literally breaks down the word: "if you don't pass it in a certain time, if you pass over that line, you're dead."
    *   **Use in Talk:** Highlights how dramatic, stressful language creates unnecessary pressure. In reality, "nobody dies" from missing most deadlines, so we should stop treating them as life-or-death.

6.  **Practice Makes the Master (Pianist Metaphor)**
    *   **The Metaphor:** Becoming a "world-class human being" is compared to becoming a world-class concert pianist like **Arthur Rubinstein**. It requires relentless, daily practice.
    *   **Use in Talk:** Emphasizes that the state of ease and happiness ("everything is okay") is a skill that must be practiced constantly, not just understood intellectually.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Story of Arthur Rubinstein:**
    *   The speaker tells two brief anecdotes about the pianist:
        1.  A woman says she'd give half her life to play like him. He replies, "Funny, that's what it cost."
        2.  In his 90s, Rubinstein says if he misses one day of practice, he knows it; two days, his housekeeper knows it; three days, the dog knows it.
    *   **Purpose:** To drive home the point that mastery (of piano or of one's own mind) requires immense, consistent, lifelong practice.

2.  **The Indian Ascetic with the Atrophied Arm:**
    *   The story of a *sadhu* or mystic who holds his arm in the air until it atrophies.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate "stupid" practice—ignoring the body's clear signals (pain) due to a rigid, dogmatic belief. Contrasts with the speaker's advice to heed the body's messages wisely.

3.  **The Etymology of "Expire":**
    *   Not a full story, but a linguistic anecdote. The speaker explains that "expire" means "to breathe out," and was used as a euphemism for death (the final out-breath).
    *   **Purpose:** To strip away euphemisms ("passed away," "gone to a better place") and focus on the direct reality of a situation: "He's dead." This aligns with the theme of seeing things as they are, without comforting stories.

### **Overall Theme of the Metaphors:**
The metaphors collectively build a case for **release, practice, and perspective.** They advocate for:
*   Letting go of mental burdens (the heavy cup, deadlines).
*   Training the mind with the diligence of a master artist (the pianist).
*   Seeing through the dramatic stories we tell ourselves (deadlines, death euphemisms) to a simpler, more manageable reality.
*   Taming the natural restlessness of the mind (monkey mind) to find peace in the present moment.
