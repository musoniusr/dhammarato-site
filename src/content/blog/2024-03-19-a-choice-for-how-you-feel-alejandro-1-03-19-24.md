### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And very few places in our society teach that. Most even psychologists don't even know that people have a choice about the way that they're going to feel. And making big decisions is all about balancing one kind of fear with another kind of fear. And when you throw both of those fears out, then you can just do what you want to do and do it happily or not do it happily. So there's no reason to explore feelings. Instead, what we need to do is to work with Anapanasati to practice feeling the way you want to feel. Like for instance, in reality it doesn't matter whether you move or whether you buy that place or whether you stay where you are. It doesn't really matter. What matters is how you feel about it, and right now you've gotten yourself into a quandary because you don't like this and you don't like that. Where in fact you could be satisfied with where you are, or you could drop where you are and be satisfied with moving. To the new place.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, that's.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** To feel good about whatever choice I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. You're always dealing. And the answer to that is, is that you didn't recognize that you have a complete choice over the way you feel.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, that's true. I was so worried about how the decision will make me feel that I forgot that I could feel however I want about each of them. That's amazing. Yes. I was worried about not fitting a washing machine in the new apartment. How will I wash my clothes? Well, I could figure it out.

**Speaker A:** Well, in Asia they have all kinds of options. You know, in Asia they have small living places and we see ads on not just Asian TV, but on YouTube and other places like that. I mean, its size is only this big as washing machine. You just wash a few things at a time in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Yes. Yeah, no, but the point is, yeah, you're right. You can feel how I choose to feel about either moving or not moving. That's much better than worrying about what's the right decision. Make whichever decision, the right decision, by feeling good about it. That's much better. Yes.

**Speaker A:** I don't know about Europe, but I do know that in the United States that the standard mentality that everybody has is that they have to have a washer that's a huge washer that sits on the floor and you stand up and you put stuff in either on the top or in the front loader or top loader. And then they have a dryer. Well, you don't need a dryer, just hang clothes out. That what you need in fact is a spinner, a spin cycle that, you know, spins long enough to take most of the water out. Then you can just hang them up in your apartment, decorate your apartment with your drying clothes.

**Speaker B:** Actually, in that building, people hanging them up outside in the public, in the common hall. Because there is no space for them. So there are solutions.

**Speaker A:** As far as the monks go, is that they don't even bother with a little washing machine. Everything that they do is washed by hand, and normally the monks will wash their clothes when they're washing their body. They take the clothes off while they're in the shower Wring them out, get them fresh, put them back on wet, and off we go.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's actually a good option.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That's actually an interesting option. I haven't thought about that. Yeah, I started putting them on. I will put some dry clothes on, but washing them while in the shower, it's a good idea.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, one of the things you can do is you can put it on the floor and dance on it. Or like they do grapes in Italy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that would be good. Awesome. Arhat, I will go because actually I will visit this apartment now. So I'm living there, was visiting for hopefully the last time before making a decision. I will go there now, but I will go there knowing that whatever choice I do, thank you, I could feel however I want about it. I need to worry so much, and it will be okay whatever it is, even I move or not.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, begin to have an easy life, and remember that the easy life is a choice, not a decision. The decision is, are you going to stay where you are and rent and pay rent and feel like you're paying rent and losing the money for the rent, and then you got to pay more rent? Or buying a house or apartment, and then you're stuck with it, and then you've got to, uh, to keep it up. Now that it belongs to you, you belong to it. You're responsible for keeping it up. Okay. And, and all of those, uh, decisions that people have to make are almost always made based upon the way they feel. But they don't even know that. They think that they're making an intelligent course, or in fact they're making always an emotional choice, and they do that ignorantly. So I invite you to get your feelings all straightened out, feel the way that you want to, and then make your choice, make your decision about what you want to do with the building.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much, Arhat. Always talking to you is so helpful. Thank you for your time. I appreciate that.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll go ahead and finish this call. It's been a short one, but it's been a sweet one. We'll talk to you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Arhat. Ciao.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the core Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

**Core Teaching:** We have complete and deliberate choice over how we feel in any situation. Our suffering arises not from external circumstances or decisions themselves, but from our uncontrolled, reactive feelings about them.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Forgotten Choice:** Modern society, including psychology, often fails to teach that we can choose our emotional state. We mistakenly believe our feelings are automatic responses to events.
2.  **Decision-Making Trap:** We typically make big life decisions by weighing fears (e.g., fear of renting vs. fear of buying). True freedom comes from letting go of these fear-based reactions.
3.  **The Practice:** Instead of being lost in analyzing feelings, one should use mindfulness of breathing (**Anapanasati**) to cultivate the skill of feeling the way one *wants* to feel. The ultimate goal is to develop satisfaction (*santutthi*) regardless of external conditions.
4.  **Practical Example:** The speaker's dilemma about moving apartments was reframed. The issue wasn't the "right" decision, but their dissatisfaction with both options. The solution is to choose to feel satisfied with staying *or* satisfied with moving, thereby making any decision a "right" one.
5.  **Breaking Mental Habits:** The talk challenges societal conditioning (like the "need" for a large washer/dryer) and encourages practical, flexible thinking (e.g., hand-washing, using a spinner). This illustrates how our preferences, not necessities, often cause stress.
6.  **Emotional Intelligence vs. Ignorance:** Most people make what they believe are logical decisions, but are actually ignorant emotional choices driven by unexamined feelings. The path to an "easy life" is to first "get your feelings all straightened out" through mindful choice, and *then* act.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a direct application of Buddhist psychology to everyday anxiety. It emphasizes that liberation is found not in controlling the world, but in mastering our internal response to it, turning life's dilemmas into opportunities for cultivating peace and contentment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary **metaphor** and **story** used are:

**1. The Metaphor of "Choice as a Tool"**
The core metaphor is that **feelings are a choice**, not an inevitable reaction. The speaker reframes emotional states as something you actively "work with" and "practice," like a skill (comparing it to *Anapanasati*, a mindfulness-of-breathing meditation). This turns the internal world into a workshop where you can craft your desired emotional state regardless of external circumstances.

**2. The Story of the Washing Machine (as a parable for problem-solving and perspective)**
This is an extended illustrative story. The listener's worry about a washing machine fitting symbolizes attachment to a specific, culturally conditioned solution (the large American-style washer/dryer). The speaker offers alternative stories:
*   **Asian compact appliances:** A story of adaptation and efficiency in small spaces.
*   **Monks washing clothes in the shower:** A story of radical simplicity and integrating tasks, showing needs can be met with minimal resources.
*   **"Dance on it like grapes in Italy":** A playful, almost celebratory image that transforms a chore into a joyful activity.

This washing machine story is a **metaphor for the larger decision** (to move or not). Just as there are multiple, unexpected ways to solve the laundry problem, there are multiple ways to frame the housing decision to feel satisfied.

**3. The Metaphor of Ownership vs. Being Owned**
When discussing buying a place, the speaker says, **"it belongs to you, you belong to it."** This is a metaphor for the hidden emotional and psychological burden of ownership—the idea that possessions can end up possessing *us* through responsibility and attachment, contrasting with the freedom of choice in how we feel.

**4. The Metaphor of the "Easy Life"**
The speaker contrasts an **"easy life" as a choice** versus a **"decision"** as a logistical puzzle. This frames the "easy life" not as a set of perfect circumstances, but as an internal orientation of chosen contentment, independent of the specific path taken.

**In summary:**
The talk uses the **metaphor of emotional choice as a practical skill** and reinforces it with a **concrete, relatable story (the washing machine)** to demonstrate how shifting perspective and stories about a problem can liberate one from anxiety. The underlying narrative is that we are not passive victims of our circumstances or feelings, but active authors of the stories we tell ourselves about them.
