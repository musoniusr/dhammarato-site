### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. So, welcome to the Sunday call. It's Sunday afternoon here in Thailand and probably late morning in the UK. And we have a lively group today, and Philip has asked the question. Let's go ahead and Philip, re-ask your question. Go ahead and reintroduce the topic.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker C:** Lately I come across a lot of discussions around various understandings of the suttas. And it seems like even though the traditions seem to be very similar.

**Speaker B:** Their.

**Speaker C:** Understanding seems to be different and a.

**Speaker A:** Lot of them are claiming that they.

**Speaker C:** Understand the suttas right and their interpretation is the right one. And it seems that's the only thing they all have in common, is they claim we are the ones who have the right interpretation.

**Speaker A:** And maybe I should jump in and do the same thing and claim that especially within the Western Buddhist context, We have a lot of, let us say, ill-trained Western teachers, and we also have a lot of people who have not been trained as a teacher, and still they consider themselves as if they understand things completely. Now, one of the points that we can start with is that the Buddha started an organization that is now normally referred to as the Bhikkhu Sangha, or perhaps also the Bhikkhuni Sangha, the Sangha of women, and that there are also lay followers, and men and women. And that there is some suttas about a couple of, in fact, a number of lay followers are mentioned in the suttas. Normally they're named as, oh, thank you very much for your teaching, Mr. Buddha. 'You have set things correctly, as if things were overturned and now you set them right, and from now on, I will become a monk or a Bhikkhu,' or they would also say, 'I will be a lay follower for life.' But there are several laymen who are actually in a special status beyond that. And that several of them in fact became teachers of the Dharma. One of them, and I've forgotten these guys' names, but one of them in particular was really, really great at going off into a place where they were doing a whole lot of discussions and set those guys straight. And he was able to do that beyond what the monks could do, both for the fact that the monks had obligations and standards that they had to make, which this guy, because he was a layman, he didn't have to meet those standards. But he was also very close to the Buddha. So what I'm— Anathapindika was actually not known as a lay disciple who was a teacher. But he was well known as a supporter in the sense that he was a banker, and that he held small amounts of money for various Bhikkhus. And the style was that they would write a note saying that I need this, or I need that, please give this man who's handing in this chit some money so that he can take care of getting a new bowl or getting a robe. If one has been lost, or other things like this, the needs of the monks. And so, Anthropythica, or Anthapadaika, actually served as the banker for the community of monks, which gives us the rise that, with that in context, it's OK for monks to have bank accounts nowadays. He also was a supporter in the sense that he built many, many buildings, including salas, and he actually bought a park. It's called Jetta's Grove, and that Jetta was a prince and owned this large property, and he says you got to pave it with gold. And I guess gold was common enough in the time of the Buddha that Antrapitaka just gave enough coins to, let us say, entice Jetta to let go of his park. And also with that, they put guards there so that your average ordinary vagrant was not allowed in there. Only monks were allowed in there. So, and Anthropythica was actually quite well established as a friend of the Sangha. But I'm actually talking about another guy who was able to teach the Dhamma because he hung out with the monks so much, and that he actually understood it better than others, to the point that the Buddha gave high recommendation for him. Now where all of this is going is, is that generally, uh, the monks were the ones who were teachers, and we have a number of them: Jhana, uh, Mahamoggama, Makkhaksana, uh, Sariputta. Uh, the list is actually quite long of monks who were actually teachers and took students on. But nowadays in Western Buddhism, it was not started the way that when Buddhism would go to a particular new country, let us say Thailand or Laos or even China, Vietnam, Buddhism was always introduced by monks, always introduced by monks. And yet in the West, Buddhism has been introduced by laypeople, most of whom were either never a monk, or they were monks for very short periods of time, let us say under a year. And so Western Buddhism actually is absolutely full of laymen who do not have a background of having been trained by a senior monk, who claim to be teachers. This is one thing that got started back in the 1970s by a couple of psychologists. I don't think that they traveled together, but one after another they would move from place to place, couldn't handle it as a Bhikkhu, and so quit, came back to the West and started teaching but they were teaching in the way of adding the Dhamma as a side point to their psychology. And then they found out that they could make a lot of money off of this. And so this is where Western Buddhism has wound up. Western Buddhism is a tragedy, with every one of them claiming to know what the Buddha taught when in fact they have not been associated for a long period of time with people who actually do know what the Buddha taught. That in fact, one of the best ways that you can see this is the bad translations. The translations of the sutras are actually quite pitiful, the English translations. So here's a point for you, Philip. Almost all of the people that you're talking about who say that they know the Suttas, they haven't learned the Pali, and even the Westerners who have learned the Pali, they still don't understand the teachings of the Buddha unless they have been a monk for a number of years. And so that would be the, let us say, the standard for us to start with, is that if you are talking to a monk who has been a monk for years Listen to him. If you've got a layman who has been teaching Dharma for years and even has something going like a teacher training program, don't join that teacher training program. Do not spend $7,000 on an online course thinking that you're going to get the real Dhamma there. Now, the next thing to say, and this is an important point, the next thing to say is that the Dhamma is not information. It's not words, it's not concepts, it's not critical thinking. Dhamma is for the living. Another way to say it, actually comes out of the Tao Te Ching: "The Dhamma that can be said is not the Dharma. The Tao that can be said is not the Tao." If you can gain that, then you can understand why it's better for guys to not make claims; that in fact, Western businesses are in the business of selling something, and therefore making claims about what they're selling. And so, you'll find some lay people who are saying, "Oh, I'm an Arahant," or, "Oh, I trained under Arya this or that person. They even gave me a name." But they themselves were not ordained. So this is the first place to start, is that if you're listening to someone who was ordained, listen to him. If you're listening to a salesman who is trying to sell you some Dhamma, sell you a book, or sell himself on Reddit, don't pay much attention to them. If you take those kind of positions you won't be confused. Now, within the various lineages— well, hello Paul, good to see you join us. Yeah, yeah, if you don't mind, I'll just continue on with the talk. If you have any questions, pop up and ask. This is an open discussion forum, but I tend to do a lot of discussing. And answering questions. All right. So Philip, back to you. Is this a good starting point for your question?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, actually that was my approach for the last few months because when I started a few months ago going deeper, I was like with a lot of Western traditions and then especially when I heard you talk a lot and other people, I more and more distilled it down to more, as you said, people who are ordained or people who lived in a ward for a long time and tried to listen to them. And then actually, even with monks and ordained people, it seems to be also a thing that I came across a lot, that people have a lot of For me, it seems they come from the same tradition. Everything is the same, but then they talk about each other in a way, okay, he's not getting it and he's totally getting it wrong. And so I stumbled exactly at the same problems there, at the same topics or points. And so the question seems to be still in my mind, even though I I thought I'm on the right track. Yeah. But yeah, I get your point. I get your point on what you were saying, especially with the thing when you see if somebody writes a book or tries to sell something, this is often something that indicates, yeah, maybe it's not the right person to listen to.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the reasons why I say start with monks is because they're already in a position of having given up the money issue, to where most of the Western, uh, teachers are in it for the money. Okay. However, there's another point to make, and that is, um, I would trust, uh, in general, let us say it this way, I would trust a very highly well-known Asian Anagami monk, not your average run-of-the-mill monk, because most of the run-of-the-mill monks are not famous, not well known, and also not long a monk. So, I would generally also not trust Westerners who have ordained, unless they've been ordained in a particular tradition or a particular group. So the names that I will name would be those who have been long-term monks under Ajahn Chah's lineage and tutelage from the beginning, like Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Pisano, and a few others like that. Those are the guys who I know know the Dharma really well, and the reason that I trust them is because they with Achan Chah were also students of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And as you know, I hold Bhikkhu Buddhadasa quite highly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** So in that regard, anything that anybody says in the form of being a teacher or a monk or anything like that, if what they're teaching goes against what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa teaches, I would go with Bhikkhuni. Yeah, further, even if I say something that seems to you to be in disagreement with what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said, I would go with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, not go with me. Okay, that I'm human enough to know that sometimes I get stuff wrong. Generally what I get wrong— hello, Drew. Good to see you. Generally what I get wrong is stuff in PHP and HTML, and I get a lot of stuff wrong, and I keep repairing it and repairing it until I get the program working the way that I want to. But in the process of that, it's all a matter of learning. Unfortunately, I don't have a Dhamma dude in the sky or on my computer who can correct every Dhamma mistake that I make. And so I tend to make the same mistakes over and over again with the Dhamma. However, I'll also say that the real teachings of the Buddha are actually quite simple. It can actually be summed up in just a few words, and if somebody is teaching against that, then pretty sure they're wrong, even when they claim that they've got the right Dhamma. Okay, and what is that? The criteria that you look at is the statement that the Buddha made, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. He said several times in, I think, 4 different suttas we found, where he says, I teach only one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And now, one of the places that that's found in his Sutta Number 22, which is also the simile of the snake. And in the simile of the snake, what the Buddha's point is, is that you have to grab— if you're going to grasp hold of a snake, you've got to do it correctly, otherwise it's dangerous. You have to grab them by the top of the throat with your hand over the top of their head to keep their mouth shut. I have seen people on the internet, in fact mostly from Florida, who have never learned to to catch pythons the way that they do it in Asia. And they are catching it lower down on the throat with the snake's mouth wide open, moving around like this. It's likely that he's going to get bit. People who grab a snake by the middle of the snake is for sure going to get bit. And if you hold it up by the tail, you got to be somebody like Cool Hand Luke in that movie. Where he held that rattlesnake up by the tail, but he was waggling it away just to make sure that it didn't bite him while he was waiting for the warden to shoot the head off that snake, because he knew that the warden was good enough shot to do that. Right. But generally, people who come to the Dharma get bitten by it. It winds up giving them Dukkha. And a clear example of that is people who do the noting method of Mahasi, which by the way is not in the Suttas anyway, that in fact they follow a system called the 16 stages of insight, which comes generally about a century, I mean 1,000 years, a millennia after the Buddha taught. And so you have also a lot of students who will say, oh, I know the Dharma because I've read this book like the Twim or IPF or whatever like that, that a number of Westerners have written. And it's pretty clear from some of them that even though they've written a book and had a lot of, let us say, cut and paste to put in that book, they wound up not living the Dharma, and it came out big time, with references to red-light districts and tin prostitutes, and all kinds of stuff. And I find it quite remarkable that a number of people will still hold that, "Well, the book is good." Well, what that means is you like the book. But the book is not the Dharma, and the Suttas are the Dharma. And so you'll have a lot of people getting bitten by the Dharma, because they're not grasping it by the head, by the top. And what is the head of the Dharma? It's Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Most of the people practice it though, this way. Dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, let me look at that dukkha, let me go examine that dukkha, and all this dukkha is like that dukkha, and I'm going down the dukkha rat hole, I'll get to the bottom of it someday, and when I do, I'll be free. Now that's certainly not the teachings of the Buddha, but that's the primary practice that you'll find all over Western Buddhism. But it's easy to see that what the Buddha was saying was dukkha dukkha Nirodha means when you you see the Dukkha right here, right now, come out of it right here, right now. Anyone who doesn't teach that, you can kind of write them off, whether they're monks or lay followers or teachers or big teachers, big book writers, all of that kind of stuff. That is really clear that the Buddha had that in mind. And let me give you several examples of the sutras to where that comes into play. One of them is in the Anagami Nikaya number 117, where this is an exposition of the Eightfold Noble Path. And as you know, the Eightfold Noble Path comes from that Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. It comes in the form of the Four Noble Truths, and then the Eightfold Noble Path is part of the Four Noble Truths as the fourth item. And in this sutta, the Buddha talks.

**Speaker B:** About.

**Speaker A:** I remember this one. What was that, Drew?

**Speaker B:** I remember this one, this is the Eightfold Noble Path.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Wait, can I take it away?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Can I go for it and then you can correct me if I'm wrong?

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure I understand your question.

**Speaker B:** I can, I think I remember the Sutta and the teaching.

**Speaker A:** Right, I use it often.

**Speaker B:** May I proceed and then if I'm wrong, may you correct me?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I think it starts with, uh, right Sati, or right remembering, which basically means first you wake up, and then once you wake up, you look, am I in Dukkha or not? And if you are in Dukkha, well, if you're not in Dukkha, then great. If you are in Dukkha, and that right looking is sometimes translated as right view, but it's more right investigation. But it's just like, am I upset or not? And then you move on to right effort. And the effort required is the effort to get rid of the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Right now.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Exactly. After that, you do that often. And so you get— it's typically translated as right attitude, but I believe you said it's right confidence.

**Speaker A:** Right attitude, right confidence. The word in Pali is Samma Sanghappa, and it is also translated as right intention. But let's back up just a little bit, because the Buddha says that right view comes first, and he does a little talk about what is wrong view, and then what is ordinary right view. And we can actually see those as concepts. And the concept of the wrong view is basically, because there is no rebirth, there's no reincarnation, and there is no priest, and there is no cops, and there is no moms and dads, there is no Kamma machine is basically the point, so I can get away with anything. And then those who have the right ordinary view, say, oh yes, there is a comma machine. Oh yes, there are cops. Yes, there is rebirth and reincarnation. Yes, there is cops and all of that, and we're going to make sure that you can't get away with it. And this is based upon the can't get away with what is breaking some rule, breaking some ordinance, breaking some precept. And the Buddha says that this is not the way to go. What we really need to do is start looking. That right noble view does not mean holding a viewpoint. It means holding the observation to look, to see what's going on. And we need to remember to do that, and when we can see what's going on, we have an opportunity right then and there to do something about it, make a change, right noble effort. All right, and if we practice that over and over and over again, as we practice them, those three things run in circle around each other so that develops a skill set so that our observation can be more observant. What we used to think was not Dukkha, we now can see is Dukkha. We also have the ability to remember more often and look more often. This is the Sati, to remember to look. And not only that, but we can develop the skill of Right Effort. In the very beginning, Right Effort is hard work, but as we gain the skill, Right Effort becomes easier and easier. And then the next item on the list after those three, that when we practice those for a very long time, we come up with Samma Sanghappa. But let me go back and make a real important point here, and that is that when we are looking at Dukkha in this regard, we're actually seeing that this thought that we're having right now is unwholesome, and change it to a wholesome thought right now. That's the real point that I'm making, is that it goes back to the Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha is something that we do right here, right now. And almost all the Western teachers are talking about attainments. They're talking about getting something that they don't have. And what we're talking about here, in fact, is getting rid of the unwholesome thoughts, not getting something new. But eliminating something old. The next point is, is that— wow, we've got a lot of new people coming on. Welcome. Got a friend with Martin, and also there's, uh, Ali Daro. Good to meet you. Okay, so back to your question. Philip, if someone is talking about finding what the problem is right now and fixing it right now, that's the teaching of the Buddha. There are other suttas where we can talk about that. One of them is Sutta 19 in the Majjhima Nikaya, and the name of the sutta is "Two Kinds of Thoughts." And the two kinds of thoughts, one would be wholesome and the other would be unwholesome. And some of the unwholesome thoughts would be thoughts of revenge, thoughts of getting even, thoughts of showing off, thoughts of gaining something that we don't have. And then the other kind of thought would be, "This is good, I've got what I need, everything is okay." There's another sutta, number 48 in the Kansambhyan Sutta, where this is an important one. In fact, this is the bomb that goes off. This is the point that really makes it home. And that is that after describing what hindrances are and what unwholesome thoughts are, then the Buddha makes the statement that there is a first knowledge, and that first knowledge is that no matter how much the mind gets disorganized, gets hindered, gets obstructed is the word that's used in the sutta, no matter how obstructed the mind is, the student will know that he can stop that. He can stop it right now and come back and see reality as it really is. Now what that means then is this First Noble, or this First Knowledge, is actually a step on the path of the Anagami, Anapanasati, and the Dhamma. This is the first point where we're actually in the Dhamma. Some people call it Srotapanna. That Srotapanna point then is noble, it is, let us say, wholesome, it is also not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people are victims. They say, "Oh, I've gotten myself into this, and now I need help to get out of it." But basically, if anything, the teaching of the Buddha is a self-help program. And what we're doing is helping ourselves out of being self, out of being selfish, out of all of our unwholesome thoughts, right here, right now. Anyone who teaches anything else— attainments, big labels, all of that kind of stuff— is because they don't understand this one important factor about the teachings of the Buddha. They still have the Western mentality, is that things take time, it takes eons, you can't do it all by yourself. And in fact, right now you can do it all, right by yourself. And then later, you've got the skill, you can do it again, all by yourself, right now. And pretty soon, a whole bunch of right nows, right after another, you can do it. What can you do? You can come out of the hindrances, and see reality as it is, right here, right now. This is the point that's big missing in Western Buddhism. Now, in fact, what Drew was actually getting at was that when we do these first three things over and over and over again, of look at what we're doing, remember to look and look and look and see that stuff, then we can change immediately. And as we do that over and over again, our attitude really begins to change in a profound way. The attitude we're normally living with is the victim's attitude of "I need help." And now that confidence comes, that attitude changes. And it comes to that attitude that I was just mentioning, and that is, no matter how much my mind gets clouded, no matter what hindrances, no matter what kind of guilt trip or ego trip I'm on, I can catch it, and I can come right out of it, and see the reality as it is. And if we can do that over and over and over again, life gets sweet. Life gets really, really nice. So, Amrit, go ahead. Yeah, one question I think is related to what you are just saying, that whenever there is a hindrance, you immediately get rid of it. And you had this interview with Guru.

**Speaker D:** Vaiking, and I think one of the.

**Speaker A:** Questions which Guru Vaiking kind of posed is, our psychologists are telling us that.

**Speaker C:** There'S maybe like, you know, very deep kind of traumas.

**Speaker A:** And those could be like responsible for hindrances.

**Speaker D:** Right?

**Speaker A:** And then they would say you have to go deep to get rid of those traumas.

**Speaker D:** You are saying that you have to.

**Speaker A:** Get— don't worry about going deep, but whenever they come in a surface, you just get rid of them.

**Speaker D:** So if you can leave it.

**Speaker A:** That's a very, very good point because I hear that in Western Buddhism also. And Philip, you'll hear a lot of the teachers talk about it in the sense of the Samsara, or better known as the Asava or the Kilesa, are deep. And therefore we got to go deep into meditation, we got to go deep. And I use that same word the way that— oh, what was the actor's name? But anyway, they think that they've got to go deep. In fact, I have a student who talked to one of the famous teachers, and what she said was about that. Oh, these things keep coming back up, and I want to go deep into meditation so that I can solve that, right? Guess what? When it comes up again, She doesn't want to deal with it right now. She wants to wait later until she can go deep into it. Yeah, yeah. And so, uh, the point is, is that when something does come up, instead of saying, oh, poor me, that's so deep, oh, I'll have to deal with it, uh, I'll have to do big, big time meditations to go deep into it to solve the problem, That's also very Western. I don't think I've ever heard a Thai monk ever talk about deep. Because why? Because anything that is going to bother you comes up right to the surface. There it is. It's not deep. If you think about a tree for a moment, recognize that first off A lot of us, even in school, are taught that a tree's roots have to go deep. So if the tree is 100 meters tall, that means that the roots go 100 meters deep. Have you ever heard of that? That was common science in grade school back in the 1950s. Guess what? 100 meters deep is probably rock, it's probably mud. There are no nutrients down there. The tree has no use to go deep into the ground with its roots. What it does instead is spread the roots out so that they could get nourishment. They can find water, they can find what the worms are leaving by, and that's what he brings up through the root system. If we can take that analogy also with that, if a seed gets buried 100 meters in the ground, how in the world is that seed going to sprout? No, the seeds have to be— crawls.

**Speaker D:** Its way up out of that, that shit.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah, the seed has to be right there on the surface in order to germinate. So our kilesa, our defilements, our asava, or as some people refer to them, the old Sankharas Let them be old. Maybe they're buried. They're buried in the sense that you're just not thinking about it right now. And then we do think about it, which means now they've come up to the surface. So when something does come to the surface, we need to deal with it right then and there rather than complain, oh, this is so deep. The better thing to say is, ah, there it is again. Aha, I see you right now. Here it is again. Let's do something about it right now. Here it is again. All right, so an example of that would, would be, oh, I'm a rebel, I have authority figure problems. When I was a kid, my daddy beat me and I hated him and I still hate him, and that stuff is buried deep. You get the concept? All right, guess what? How do we deal with our authority figure problems? Is when the feelings come up of rebelling against authority, right now I can say, 'Aha, I see it right now. Let me do something about that right now. Let me come out of it right now.' So, got a new guy joining. Wow, what a group we're getting. So If we can deal with the stuff right here, right now, we don't have to worry about where it came from. That I'll point out for just a moment, that the Buddha had four imponderables, four things that we'll never be able to figure out, and there's no reason to try to fix it, no reason to try to figure things out. Let's just go ahead and deal with the results that we're dealing with right now. And one of those reponderables is, how did things get started? What was the original? What was the origin? Like, for instance, what was the origin of the universe? What was the Big Bang theory? Guess what? That was so long ago, I don't give a flying rip. I don't care what happened. I don't know what happened. I don't know how things got started. But I do know what this moment is because I'm looking at it. All right, so when people— I mean, when they talk about going deep in the meditation, to go deep to find those kleshas and those asavas and those defilements deep, they're actually breaking that rule that the Buddha had about the Four Imponderables. They're trying to ponder their way down to the original source, hoping that they can figure it out they can get cured. Which brings up a joke. This really angry dude, he was quite unhappy, always angry, goes to a psychotherapist. And after a while, they start working together and figuring things out. And then it came up that he is angry now because he got a spanking when he was 4 years old. That he's been an asshole his whole life because he got a spanking when he was 4 years old. And the therapist says, now we know how all of this got started. Didn't solve his problem about being angry, but it did at least give him the idea that this is where it started. The reality is though, is that his mama gave him a spanking when he was 4 years old because he was already an asshole. They didn't dig deep enough. So this is the problem with digging deep. Let's not dig deep. Let's fix what we can come up to the surface. When that happens in the mind, we can say, hot dog, I can see that. And now, because I can see it, now because it's come up, I can take the effort, the right noble effort to change it from unwholesome to wholesome. And so there are many different Suttas that I've already mentioned, 3 of them, and there's other Suttas that talk about that the defilements, doesn't matter what the source of them are, or where that stuff comes from, the question is, can you catch it? Can you see it? Are you on guard? Have the remembrance to remember to look at those defilements and say, "I can change that. I can come out of it." Goenka has a very, very excellent point in one line. He says, "When the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again." Well, those people who want to dig deep, they're not never minding, start again. They're not saying, "Oh, will that come up?" and just throw it out and let's just go back to the practice and do fine. They're saying, "Oh me, that stuff is so deep. Oh me, the mind wandered away into forbidden territory that's so deep, it's so bad." And the right way to do it instead is, never mind where that stuff comes from, let's fix it right now. Let's fix this event. And what we're doing with that is we're actually modifying our habit system. We're changing the neurological pathways that keep us in that old Kamma, that old way of doing things. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is very, very big on the change model. We've got to change, and the way to change it is to see it right now and change it. Right now. So that's the big point. If your teachers, if your Westerners are talking about it from having the joy of being able to fix the problem as it arises, then they're actually teaching the Dhamma. If they talk about going deep into meditation, they're not teaching what the Buddha taught. Yes, go ahead, Paul.

**Speaker D:** Oh man, lovely. I'm enjoying what you're talking about. What would you recommend as a practice?

**Speaker A:** I would recommend Anapanasati as the practice. And in fact, Anapanasati was made made for the Eightfold Noble Path. This is the way that we practice the Eightfold Noble Path. And it seems quite logical then that Sutta 118, the Anapanasati Sutta, follows immediately behind the 117, the exposition of the Eightfold Noble Path called the Great Forty. Now Anapanasati is based upon the Satipatthana. The Satipatthana means the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. You can hear the word Sati built right into it, like Anapanasati. It all has to do with remembering right here, right now, to do something right here, right now. And what we're going to do is based upon the four elements. And the four elements are basically the four elements of your own existence. Everybody has a body, everybody has feelings, everybody has a mind and the mind states that it goes through, and then everybody has the thoughts of both reality and non-reality. So this is the Satipatthana. In the Pali, it's kayanupassana, the body; vedanupassana, the feeling; Citta-nupassana, the mind states, and Dhamma-nupassana, the things that are moving around. In fact, item number 13 in the Anapanasati practice, which is the first item on the list of the Dhamma-nupassana, what the mind's objects are, is notice that they're temporary. They're always temporary, they're always moving. You can't hold a thought. In fact, Freud understood it as free association, that the mind will jump around from item to item and item like this. In fact, in old Buddhism they have the term called the monkey mind, and what this means is, the mind is changing. Fixed, and we can begin to see that. So we move all four of these things together. In Anapanasati, we work with the breathing. We work with the breathing in order to understand the body, and we work with the body and understanding it in order to have the point of relaxing the body. We work with the mind in the sense of gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, investigating the mind, that we can eventually liberate the mind and unify the mind. And when I say eventually, I don't mean years and years. I mean, as you're practicing, all of this can happen within the first hour, within the first 10 minutes of the first practitioner's practice.

**Speaker D:** What do you think about affirmations? Because I was really getting hard into.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the problem with affirmations is that most people don't believe them. Affirmations means like the teenage girl will stand in front of the mirror and say, "Oh, I'm so beautiful. Oh, everybody loves me." And deep down inside, she knows that's not true. Well, Paul left. Maybe he'll come back. Oh, he's back. Okay, I missed you. I'm glad you're back.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, no, no, sorry about that. Okay, my question was like affirmations and trying to gladden the mind, you know.

**Speaker A:** I, I, you know, okay, let's put it this way then. Let's gladden the mind with things that we know are true.

**Speaker D:** Okay, I'm breathing.

**Speaker A:** I'm breathing. All right, I'm breathing. That's true. I'm still alive. Hallelujah, I'm alive!

**Speaker B:** The truth. That's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and that, uh, um, uh, an affirmation would be, I'm going to live forever. I can fly. That comes out of an old TV commercial, you know, or an old Right. All right, so affirmations are not true, and because they're not true, they, they don't have lasting value. But gladdening the mind, the gladdening of the mind would be, for instance, everyone that's sitting here with us is not in actual danger. No one is breaking in. You've got no alligators or, uh, pythons on the floor, no rattlesnakes on your leg. So we can actually say right now, I'm safe. This is not an affirmation, it's the reality. And yet a lot of people have a constant underlying— I wouldn't call it constant or underlying, let us say frequently we have anxiety, we have frequently, we have Frustration. These are elements of fear. And yet, right here, right now, there is nothing to fear. Right now I'm safe. So that would be a gladdening of mind, a brightening of mind, based upon the fact that you actually are safe right here, right now. Wow, what a relief it is! I'm not in danger. I can relax. All right, the next point, which is actually an issue that's in Western Buddhism big time, it comes from the body postures. And the body postures that are found in Asia are body postures that people live. I live in Thailand here right now. We've got 8 or 9 people as guests there's not enough chairs or furniture to go around. Well, never mind, they don't have furniture at home anyway. What do they do? They sit on the floor. They're very comfortable sitting on the floor. Westerners are not comfortable sitting on the floor. Can you become comfortable sitting on the floor, or can you practice sitting in a chair and be comfortable? But this is another point that we're looking at, is that practice by getting the body comfortable so it will relax. And yet you'll see a lot of Westerners saying, "Oh, you're supposed to sit for a long time, you've got to have strong determination sitting. Never mind the fact that your knees are rotting off and you've got no circulation, you've got to sit still." Have you ever heard of that kind of stuff? Well, that's not what the Buddha teaches. He teaches to be comfortable. If the body is comfortable, then you can get the mind to relax and become comfortable. But if your body is in pain, it's hard to get the mind to relax and become comfortable. We're going to stay with reality now.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, you know how you said either get comfortable on a chair or learn how to be comfortable in whatever posture you choose? Totally by accident, I've been going to the gym recently and my muscles got stronger and it just meant that I could sit more comfortably and for longer, for easy, like easier. So.

**Speaker A:** So it's a training process, but most people train too much, just like people who go to the gym for the first time, they train too much. I've also seen bodybuilders train too much, right? They want too much, they want more and more and more, and so they overtrain. And when you, uh, beginners overtrain They wind up being sore for a day or two or three or four, and then they don't come back to the gym. The same thing happens with people practicing sitting meditation on the floor. They practice too long. They've heard an hour or 45 minutes, and that's way too long for most people in the beginning. It takes time to build that up, just as you're saying, Drew, and that most people become uncomfortable before the bell rings. Most people become.

**Speaker D:** You know, I, I, you know, I started off with the Goenka stuff, and Goenka was encouraging you to do an hour in the morning, an hour in the evening. And here I am, you know, just, you know, I've done this 10-day retreat, you know, as a, you know, Westerner.

**Speaker A:** Damn, those retreats from Goenka are known as boot camps of Buddhism.

**Speaker D:** Hell yeah, you know what, and I respect to— respect to Goenka, man. Fucking hell, I mean, he helped me out, but damn, it's hard.

**Speaker A:** I spent almost 3 years with him off and on in India. I traveled around with him, went to Jaipur and, uh, Hyderabad and all kinds of retreats. I was really into it, but I was lucky enough to get out of it. But while I was there, I learned to sit. At least I learned to sit. I didn't learn to be happy, but I learned to sit because I forced myself into it. Okay, but that's not necessary to do. It's an option. And so this is another thing about Western Buddhism, is that they expect you to work really hard, and the whole teaching of the Buddha is to be calm, easy, relax, take it easy, come out of your frustrations, see that there is no danger, there are no problems, you're safe, you're secure, and if you're practicing correctly, you're comfortable. These are three things very important: safe, secure, comfortable. Because if you don't have them, then you can't go to the next step. And the next step would be satisfaction. Now, satisfaction in the Pali is the word Sukkha, and the Dukkha-Sukkha pair is normally referred to as opposites. One of the students was from India, and his parents spoke in the house fluent Gujarati. And he knows that in Gujarati language, dukkha and sukha are opposites. In the Thai language, dukkha and sukha are opposites. And in English, we can say that dissatisfaction and satisfaction are opposites. Would you agree dissatisfaction and satisfaction are opposites? I would agree. All right, so if that's the case, then if you can spend a few minutes to get yourself into the mental state of and the feeling of being satisfied and everything is okay right now, that means that you, in fact, you have succeeded in the teaching of the Buddha You have come out of Dukkha, you've come out of dissatisfaction, and now in this moment you're in the state of satisfaction. That's the whole teaching of the Buddha right there, is to come out of dissatisfaction into the state of satisfaction. And all that's left now is to do it again and to do it again and to do it again and to do it again, over and over and over again, to keep practicing coming out of your frustrations, out of your worries, out of your fears, into a state of comfort. Into a state of satisfaction. Wow, what a relief it is! And so, you got to sit for an hour. Go ahead, Paul.

**Speaker D:** I said that's a simple— go ahead— uh, teaching. That's very simple and nice, concise.

**Speaker A:** That's another point. You just made an important point. If a Western teacher says that the teaching of the Buddha is always so complicated— look how many sutras there are, oh, you gotta practice for years and years— he's not actually teaching the teaching of the Buddha. He's in fact teaching his level of pride. Oh, look how hard I tried, look how many hours I put into meditation, look how many books I've read. This is how a lot of pride comes up with people practicing that Western Buddhism. And so naturally, they'll say, "Oh, you've got to go read all these books, and you've got to do all of this practice, and maybe you'll wind up where I am, and I'm not even where I want to be." So this is another way of looking at Western Buddhism, in the sense that they have, let us call it, an advanced level of suffering. They've worked so hard for so long, they've got so many good habits built up that now their advanced forms of suffering are very subtle. Another one would be talking about the actual things that the Buddha taught. Are far away. An example of that would be Nibbana. Then in fact, in some places, people think of Nibbana as after death, or maybe it's a city, maybe Shangri-La, or maybe a heaven or something like that. But the actual word Nibbana, or Nibbana, basically just means to chill, to cool off. That the word was used in the time of the Buddha in two ways, and he gave it a third meaning. The first two ways was an animal. If a dog is barking and barking and barking, he is hot. But if the dog shuts up and lays down, he's cool, he's domesticated. That's one form of Nibbana. Dogs do it. They come out of it and they start barking, they get excited, they play with their toys, they fight with each other, and then they'll lay down and relax.— to where humans, they play with their toys and they bark at each other and they bite and they get into fights, and then they go and get into another fight, and they never find out any relaxation. After they leave a fight, they go home and reconstruct that fight, trying to figure out how they can win it next time. You all know what I'm talking about. Can you come actually to the point of coming out of your fights and relax? Can you cool out? Can you chill? This is what the word Nibbana actually means. The second use of the word Nibbana means food that's being cooked, and when it is finished cooking, it's too hot to eat. Like pizza. Have you ever had a really hot pizza? The cheese sticks to the roof of your mouth, and now you're sore for days. Some food is too hot to pick up, but it's not too hot to eat. And so, we put a fork in it, so that we don't have to touch it, because it's too hot for the hands, but somehow or another, it's delicious enough that we can maintain, we can keep it in our mouth, even though it's too hot to eat. But, if you let the food cool, Now it's even more delicious and you don't have to work so hard at it. So these are the two definitions of Nibbana, and the Buddha put it in the context of the mind, that when we stop heating things up, things will naturally cool off. So all we have to do is take things out of our fire. Have the monkey mind stop jumping around and you'll naturally cool off, you'll chill out. And yet you can hear in Western Buddhism, "Oh, Nibbana is 1,000 miles from here." Oh no, it's only a breath.

**Speaker B:** Away.

**Speaker A:** It's only a breath away. Can you chill now? Another example would be the word enlightenment. How many here, by the way, are enlightened?

**Speaker D:** Anybody? I feel enlightened.

**Speaker A:** All right, we've got a winner here. Yay! Absolutely. Amrit, what happened? You're not.

**Speaker B:** Enlightened?

**Speaker D:** Uh, not— I think, um, yeah, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Maybe next bit. Michael, what happened? Already home. Well, raise your hand, who here is enlightened? Here's the point: does anybody have a good, working, usable definition of enlightenment? Or are we going to leave it to Western definition of enlightenment as far away, as way off there someplace, it's hard to find, and we don't even have a good definition of it, and we don't know what it is. So let me give you a very clear, succinct definition of enlightenment, and it's built right into the word. And by the way, the word enlightenment comes out of the French Revolution. It comes out of a huge conflict between the Catholic Church and all the Protestants who did want to be. And so that was the Age of Enlightenment. But the important point was, is that it was coming out of stories and magical thinking into reality, into science. And so with that, with the base of the original point, we can look at the word enlightenment and see the word light in it. And the first quality of the word light is to shine a light on it. The light of day. Let's see it in the daylight. That's an important point, because you can't see when things are dark. But if you can turn the light on, then you can see what's going on. This is in fact right noble view, requires some light. And so anybody who can see because they can, um, are shining a light on it, then they're enlightened right then and there. The next point is, is that the word light also has the quality of not heavy. If you drop your woes, if you drop your problems, if you drop all of the crap, then, then you lighten up. It's easy to hop, skip, and jump around when you're not carrying 30 pounds of baggage. And that's what— when we travel, we always carry baggage with us. And so when people are traveling, they're generally pretty miserable. They got to watch that bag, and they got to carry that bag. And why do they carry their bags around? Because they think, oh, there's something in that bag I might need later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But let's look at it from the position of, let's lighten up, let's become unburdened. So the two kinds of light put together, enlightenment is that you can see things as the way that they are, and you can see that that is a hindrance, you can see that that's a burden, and you can set it down. So this gives the twin idea of knowledge and deliverance, or knowledge and freedom. And if you can see what you're doing and set it down right then and there, you've lightened up. You become free of whatever it was that you were carrying. So the correct answer then to 'are you enlightened' is, well, it comes and it goes, but it comes often and it goes slowly. It's not way up there, it's not some magical place way off in the distance. It's right here in front of us, just like the entire teaching of the Buddha. So when people write books and they say, oh, I'm enlightened, or oh, I'm an Arahant, and all of that kind of stuff, that's like a snake. Remember that I talked about the simile of the snake? That snake's going to bite them. If you claim that you're an Arahant, you're going to have a whole lot of Westerners come gunning for you. You're a target now. Better not to claim anything. If you don't claim anything, then you don't make a target out of yourself. So go ahead and be enlightened, just keep your mouth shut while you're enlightened. And when you're not enlightened, that's a better time to keep your mouth.

**Speaker B:** Shut.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way to look at it from the perspective of Western Buddhism. Is anybody who's making claims about themselves better not to, uh, uh, go with them if they're talking about problems being deep? That's not the teaching of the Buddha. If they're talking about that it takes a long time, then that's not the teaching of the Buddha. If they say, oh, I'm an expert on the suttas, I don't know what that means. It sounds like somebody's claiming something. So that gives you, Philip, a whole lot of ammunition or a whole lot of let us say, ways of looking at things so that you can begin to see who's a good teacher or not. And the last one on the list is, if they charge money, don't pay them. Don't pay the fees. In fact, what you want to do instead is go look for a place that you can stay for free, like a wat. Maybe even here on the porch. Michael, by the way, is on the porch. Can you.

**Speaker D:** Tell? What's a what? I've, I've heard this term before.

**Speaker A:** The word what comes from the Pali word the hara, and that in Thai language they've changed it to what— they kind of shorten everything. And the word bhavana actually means in the home or in the heart. And so it's actually the home for the monks. In Sri Lanka, they use the word bhavana as the home for the monks. But the word wat itself is actually a Thai translation of the word bhavana. So whenever you're really, really at home You're in the Bhavana. You're in the heart place, finding yourself at home, finding yourself comfortable. You're in the right place. You're at home. It's.

**Speaker B:** Home.

**Speaker A:** Where you're welcome, feel comfortable. I almost thought of the word let your hair down, but it's better to go ahead and remove that stuff. We don't need it so much. So does anybody else have any last moment questions? Wow, this has been so much fun. Time flies when you're having fun. Paul, good to see.

**Speaker B:** You.

**Speaker D:** You too, you too, my friend.

**Speaker A:** Amit, how about you? You got any last things to.

**Speaker D:** Say?

**Speaker A:** No, thanks a lot for the talk.

**Speaker D:** So I think for now I am.

**Speaker A:** All set up, all enlightened. You're already enlightened, you're good enough. That's what the Zen masters keep telling their students, you're already enlightened, stop trying to get anything, you're already okay.

**Speaker D:** You know what I also wanted to say before we left this? You know, I didn't realize that the sun radiates pure white light. That is pure white light, you know. It's like brilliant. And sorry, that's probably— yeah, daylight, you can see things. Well, I love y'all. All.

**Speaker A:** Right, welcome back. Good to see you, Philip. Do you have any last.

**Speaker C:** Points? No, not really. Thanks for your answer and for all your explanations. Maybe one last thing. It's maybe a little bit of a long question, so maybe just don't stretch it too long. But you often refer to Western Buddhism. You frequently say that. Would you say that there is an Eastern Buddhism too? Would you call that the original Buddhism? Like, would you call that Eastern Buddhism? As counterpart to Western Buddhism?

**Speaker A:** I would say yes, and I would say offhand that the way that you can make a distinction, or better still to say it this way, that Western Buddhism is now the new kid on the block. We have had all of these other places, we've had Japan and Korea with the Zen, we've had Chan Mahayana in China, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Sri Lanka, and now back to India. And one thing for sure with all of them is that they were all started by Bhikkhus, they were all started by bringing Sangha. And Western Buddhism Western Buddhism was brought to the West by Christians, by theologians, by booksellers, by translators, and by ordinary laypeople. It was not brought to the West by Bhikkhus. Now there's a whole lot of Bhikkhus. In fact, there's about 500 Watts more Bhavanas, more Tibetan places, and they all have monks. And if you want to go find a place in the West, go to a temple, go to a wat, go to a Mahayana. I don't care if it's Mahayana or Theravada, but don't go to the psychologist, don't go to the retreat.

**Speaker C:** Centers.

**Speaker A:** Would you also call someone who has already devoted their entire lives to the teaching of the Buddha rather than their.

**Speaker C:** Pocketbook But would you also call Goenka as Western Buddhism? Because you often criticized Western Buddhism today, but Goenka, a lot of stuff that.

**Speaker A:** You said— He was Indian, right? He was originally Indian. He studied in Burma, but he didn't get enough Buddhism until he was actually deported from Burma while he was a student of U Ba Khin. Right. And that most of his students in the beginning were Indians. I was one of the very few first Westerners there. Yeah. Okay, so I would say offhand that, uh, Goenka's method was converted by his Western students into a Western form of Buddhism. The same thing is true with Mahasi. I didn't meet Mahasi. By the time I got to Burma, he was already dead. But what we have is the Mahasi method in the West is a Western form of Buddhism, not really Burmese at all. Okay. Almost all of the teachers are Westerners. They've never been ordained.

**Speaker C:** The problem with the Goenka stuff is probably you met him, but nowadays there is no teaching. Went to a Goenka retreat. And as you know, there's only the tapes. And he says, go deep. And then you basically are sitting there without any guidance. And then there's so much confusion, confusion. And coming back to my question from the start, he was the first person who I heard saying, I have the purest teaching of the Buddha. It's it's really pure. And so that was the first time that I heard that coming.

**Speaker A:** Really, that's interesting. I have never heard Goenka himself say such a thing.

**Speaker C:** He says it's on the tapes, like they play every day a tape, like a talk after the meditation. And he said, he, in his tradition, in his line, that's the purest teaching of the Buddha. And so that's the where I first heard that actually.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, he wasn't in Burma long enough to find out what the real teachings of the Buddha were, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just mentioned that to coming back to my point from the start to my question that I heard it so often that people say that.

**Speaker A:** And well, there is, you know, I.

**Speaker D:** Got mad with Bhante for Goenka. Do you, you, Dharma, uh, Dharma Morato?

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thank you. Do you respect, um, uh, Goenka?

**Speaker A:** He was a great teacher for me, but I left. Let us put it this way: in Western education, you have first grade, second grade, middle school, high school, going into university. Yeah, and you will have sometimes new math teachers that have just gotten their PhD, and then you'll have the old professors. So the new professors will say, oh, I know math a whole lot better than the first grade teacher. But the old professors will say, oh, I'm really glad for the first grade teachers, because if I didn't have first grade teachers to teach all of these students about numbers and arithmetic, my job would be really.

**Speaker D:** Hard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Okay, with that context, yes, we can say that there are many teachers who are useful and valuable to get started, but they are not Professor Emeritus of Buddhism. Yeah, you need to go to find someone who has devoted his whole life to the Buddha, someone who was ordained, somebody who's been a monk for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. These are the ones that you're going to get your PhD in Buddhism from. And I find it really amusing, by the way, on the side is that Harvard and other universities in the United States offer PhD in Buddhist studies, and not one professor on those boards of those departments have ever been a monk. In fact, they've never even been Buddhist. They've been philosophers and religious people and all of that kind of stuff, and they put them together in a department and call it Buddhist studies, and not one of them know anything about Buddhism So, what are they going to make the PhD candidate do? They're going to make him read! Maybe learn a new language! And so, I would say that Goenka has great value, but he also has a possible disadvantage, because it may be years after someone does a Goenka retreat before they ever go back and do another And so a lot of people get some bad taste about Buddhism by doing a Goenka retreat.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I know, you.

**Speaker A:** Know. All right, but I don't want to criticize them. If I was criticizing, that would be like a professor criticizing a first-grade math teacher, or maybe the professor is criticizing a high school algebra teacher. Without a high school algebra teacher, you're not going to have anybody in the department of mathematics doing PhDs in mathematics. You have to have the high school algebra teachers. But the difference is, look how many high schoolers take algebra, and look how many people are doing a PhD in mathematics, and that kind of gives you the idea. But if we can get people started correctly, if we can get people to learn to sing their ABCs of Buddhism, then they'll enjoy it, and they'll get something out of it. Most of the people quit Buddhism because they're not getting any value out of it. Not, let us say, the cost-benefit ratio is such that the amount of work that they put in versus the amount of value that they get out of it, and so they quit. What we would really like to do is to turn around Western Buddhism so that all the new people who come into Buddhism get immediate value right out of it. Then they'll stay, and then we'll have a whole Buddhist country someplace in the West. Oh wow, people change because they could see the value in.

**Speaker D:** It. Okay, what— oh man, what are the three qualities that you would want to encourage in, uh, uh, you know?

**Speaker A:** I'll give you two qualities: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which is another way of saying it is don't worry, be happy. Yeah, yeah. Don't worry, be happy. But you have to keep doing it, because people who stop worrying and be happy, they'll start worrying again. So you have to do it again: Don't worry, be happy. And like the song says, if you're not happy, call me, I make you happy. That's the job of a Dhamma teacher. They come unhappy and they leave happy. Psychologists Not that they don't have that job. You come to them unhappy and you leave unhappy and broke. I love it.

**Speaker D:** You know, I used to work at a till counter and my whole goal was I want every person to come into my counter to leave a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Happier.

**Speaker D:** And I had so much fun doing that.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Yeah, spread our joy. That's what we get from the teaching of the Buddha. That's another point, Philip. That's probably the last thing that I have to say. You run across a Dhamma teacher that's morose and unhappy and complaining— excuse me— but if you run across somebody, a happy old man who just enjoys the Dhamma and enjoys talking about it, That's the kind of guy you want to stay with. Go find a happy monk, not an unhappy.

**Speaker B:** One.

**Speaker A:** All right, guys, well, let's leave this end. Thank you so much, I really appreciate you, Paul, coming.

**Speaker D:** On. Thank you, thank you for being here, man.

**Speaker A:** How do you say it? Anagami. You've been quiet the whole.

**Speaker D:** Time.

**Speaker A:** Alejandro, Alejandro, I've been listening. Okay, call again. We'll see you. Thank you. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Bye. Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker D:** All the best.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Problem: Confusion in Western Buddhism**
The discussion begins with a question about conflicting interpretations of the suttas, where various teachers and traditions all claim to have the "right" understanding. Dhammarato identifies the root of this confusion as the unique development of **Western Buddhism**.

### **Main Critique: The Flawed Foundation of Western Buddhism**
Dhammarato argues that unlike Buddhism's historical spread to Asia—which was always led by ordained monastics (Bhikkhus)—Buddhism in the West was largely introduced by **laypeople, psychologists, and authors**. Many of these Western teachers:
*   Were never ordained or were monks for only a short time.
*   Lack long-term training under a senior monastic.
*   Often mix Dhamma with psychology or other systems.
*   Frequently operate as **businesses**, selling books, courses, and retreats.
*   Rely on poor English translations of the Pali suttas.

**Advice:** Be skeptical of lay teachers selling Dhamma. Instead, seek out teachings from **long-term ordained monastics** (20+ years), particularly those from respected lineages like Ajahn Chah's, which traces back to Ajahn Buddhadasa.

### **The Essence of the True Dhamma**
Dhammarato repeatedly emphasizes that the Buddha's core teaching is simple and practical, not conceptual or academic:
*   **The Heart of the Teaching:** **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"** (Suffering, the Cause of Suffering, the Cessation of Suffering). The practice is about **ending suffering *here and now***, not attaining something distant in the future.
*   **The Wrong Approach:** Much of Western Buddhism focuses on analyzing dukkha, "going deep" into past traumas, or striving for distant attainments (like "enlightenment" as a far-off goal). This creates more suffering.
*   **The Right Approach:** Use the **Eightfold Noble Path** as a moment-to-moment practice:
    1.  **Right View/Investigation:** Look to see if there is dukkha (unwholesome mind states) right now.
    2.  **Right Effort:** Make the effort to abandon that unwholesome state *immediately*.
    3.  **Right Mindfulness:** Remember to do this practice again and again.
*   This cycle builds **Right Attitude/Confidence (Samma Sankappa)**: the knowledge that no matter how hindered the mind becomes, you can always free it *in the present moment*.

### **Key Practical Instructions**
1.  **Deal with Surface, Not "Depth":** When a hindrance (anger, fear, etc.) arises, deal with it **right then**. Don't get lost in backstories or believe you must excavate "deep" trauma. The problem is present now; fix it now.
2.  **Practice for Comfort & Happiness:** The goal is to become **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied (sukkha)**. Meditation postures should be comfortable. If sitting is painful, use a chair. The practice should feel relieving, not like a punishing "boot camp."
3.  **Clarify Misunderstood Terms:**
    *   **Nibbana:** Means to "cool off" or "chill out." It's the peaceful, satisfied state when the mind stops "heating up" with craving and aversion. It's accessible now.
    *   **Enlightenment:** Means to "shine a light" on the present moment (see things clearly) and to "lighten up" (drop mental baggage). It's a momentary experience of freedom, not a permanent, distant status.
4.  **Recommended Practice:** **Ānāpānasati (Mindfulness of Breathing)** as outlined in the suttas, as it systematically cultivates the factors of the Eightfold Path and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (body, feelings, mind, mind objects).

### **Final Guidance for Finding a True Teacher**
*   Prefer **long-term ordained monastics** over lay teachers.
*   Be wary of anyone **selling** Dhamma (books, expensive courses).
*   Avoid teachers who speak of problems as "deep," require long, arduous striving, or promise distant attainments.
*   **The best indicator:** A teacher should be **happy, joyful, and relaxed**. The Dhamma's result is visible as peace and satisfaction. If a teacher is morose or severe, something is off.
*   In the West, visit **traditional temples or monasteries (wats)** founded by monastics, rather than secular meditation centers.

**In essence:** The talk is a call to return to the simple, present-moment heart of the Buddha's teaching—the immediate cessation of suffering—and to be discerning about the modern marketplace of Buddhist ideas, which often obscures this simplicity.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate his points about the Dhamma and the problems he sees in "Western Buddhism." Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **The Snake Simile (from the Suttas):**
    *   **What it is:** He references the "simile of the snake" from the Majjhima Nikaya (Sutta 22). Grasping the Dhamma incorrectly is like grabbing a snake incorrectly—it will bite you (cause suffering). You must grasp it correctly by the head.
    * **His use:** He uses this to criticize approaches that focus excessively on *dukkha* (suffering) itself. The "head of the Dhamma" is **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"**—seeing suffering and *ending it right now*. Grabbing the snake by the middle or tail (e.g., endlessly analyzing suffering) is dangerous.

2.  **The Tree Roots:**
    *   **What it is:** He challenges the common idea that a tree's roots must go deep. He argues roots spread out wide to find nourishment, they don't go uselessly deep into barren soil.
    *   **His use:** This counters the Western Buddhist tendency to believe defilements (*kilesa*) are "deep" and require "deep" meditation to excavate. He says problems surface to be dealt with *now*; they aren't buried mysteries needing years of digging.

3.  **Nibbana as "Cooling Off":**
    *   **What it is:** He gives the literal, mundane meanings of *nibbana*: 1) a dog stopping its frantic barking and lying down (cooling off), and 2) hot food cooling down to an edible temperature.
    *   **His use:** To demystify the ultimate goal. Nibbana isn't a distant, mystical heaven but the natural result of stopping the mental "heating up" (craving, aversion). It's about chilling out *now*.

4.  **Enlightenment as "Light":**
    *   **What it is:** He breaks down the word "enlightenment" into two aspects of "light": a) **Illumination** (shining a light to see things clearly) and b) **Lightness** (becoming unburdened, dropping baggage).
    *   **His use:** To make enlightenment immediate and practical. It's the moment you see a hindrance (light shines on it) and let it go (you lighten your load). It's not a distant, grandiose achievement.

5.  **Academic vs. Practical Learning:**
    *   **What it is:** He compares learning the Dhamma to the education system: first-grade teachers (introductory methods like Goenka's) are necessary, but you don't get a "PhD in Buddhism" from them. For that, you need a "Professor Emeritus"—a monk with decades of dedicated practice.
    *   **His use:** To explain that while some Western teachers have introductory value, the profound, complete understanding comes from long-term, ordained monastics, not academics or short-term practitioners.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Layman Teacher:**
    *   **What it is:** He tells a story (referencing the suttas) of a specific layman who was so adept he could correct others in debate, even more effectively than monks, because he was close to the Buddha but unconstrained by monastic rules.
    *   **His use:** To show that deep understanding is possible for lay followers, but to contrast this with modern "ill-trained Western teachers" who lack that deep, traditional training and connection.

2.  **Anathapindika the Banker:**
    *   **What it is:** The story of the wealthy lay disciple Anathapindika, who financially supported the Sangha, bought Jetavana Grove by covering it in gold coins, and acted as a banker for the monks.
    *   **His use:** To humorously justify monks having bank accounts today and to illustrate the proper, supportive role of a lay follower, contrasting it with laypeople today who set themselves up as primary teachers.

3.  **The Angry Man and the Therapist:**
    *   **What it is:** A joke about an angry man who, after therapy, traces his anger to a spanking at age four. The punchline is: "His mama gave him a spanking when he was 4 years old **because he was already an asshole.** They didn't dig deep enough."
    *   **His use:** To mock the Western therapeutic (and Buddhist) obsession with finding root causes. The point is to deal with the present manifestation, not endlessly dig for origins—which aligns with the Buddha's teaching on the "imponderables."

4.  **Westerners Introducing Buddhism:**
    *   **What it is:** A historical claim that when Buddhism spread to Asia, it was always introduced by monks. In contrast, in the West, it was introduced largely by laypeople, often psychologists, who were monks only briefly or never.
    *   **His use:** To explain the root of the problem he calls "Western Buddhism": a lack of proper lineage and training, commercialized by people "in it for the money."

5.  **Goenka Retreats as "Boot Camps":**
    *   **What it is:** A personal anecdote. He spent nearly three years with S.N. Goenka and describes the 10-day retreats as "boot camps of Buddhism."
    *   **His use:** To acknowledge Goenka's value as a "first-grade teacher" that introduces discipline (like learning to sit), but to distinguish it from the simpler, gentler, and more immediately joyful practice he advocates.

### **Summary of Core Messages via Metaphor:**
The metaphors collectively argue that the true Dhamma is:
*   **Immediate:** Deal with suffering as it arises (*like a surfaced seed, not deep roots*).
*   **Simple and Practical:** It's about cooling down (*nibbana*), lightening up (*enlightenment*), and grabbing the right part (*the snake's head*).
*   **Joyful:** The result is satisfaction and happiness (*sukkha*), not just grim endurance.
*   **Accessible but Often Distorted:** It's been turned into a commercial, overly complex, and arduous project in the West, unlike its traditional transmission through a trained, renunciate Sangha.
