### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So when you have those thoughts, don't buy into them. Oh, Dhammarato's angry. Oh, that's ridiculous. You can throw that out. You can in fact laugh at what a ridiculous thought. But the one that's a little more worrisome would be, oh, I'm sick. I should feel bad. Because the body is sick.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Or the body is not strong. And as I said before, that's probably an old bad habit you picked up in diapers. If when you were sick as a child, your mama— oh, poor baby. Oh, we got to rush you to the hospital. Oh, this is so worrisome. And so she sent her worries telepathically right into your brain. When you feel bad, you're supposed to worry and feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** When the body is sick, you're supposed to be sick mentally also. And that's a bad habit that you picked up. The question is, can you catch that Can you see that in the process and say, hey, I can feel good while I'm sick? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I was just like, people say like when the kid, you know, when children are running around and they fall down, usually the first thing— I'm not sure how accurate this is— but they try to look at their caregivers, their adults. To see if they are worried. And if they are worried, they'll start crying. But if the parents are looking at them like Anagami, non-reactively, then the children just clamps on and happily start running again.

**Speaker A:** Like, like, well, in that regard then, laughter is the best medicine. If the doctor starts walking into your hospital room with the chart, looking at your chart, laughing You're going to like that. But if the doctor working at your chart walks into the room all glum and everything— no, this is worrisome— then you're going to feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Huh?

**Speaker B:** I have to confirm some details, but I got to the step.

**Speaker A:** You got to set Yeah, it's just—.

**Speaker B:** It'S not confirmed yet.

**Speaker A:** Okay, can you have it set up? That's the return shipment details from— from us.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Return method, select pickup. That's the right way to do it. Okay, pick up. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So back to what we were talking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the doctor.

**Speaker A:** So be your own doctor. Look at your own chart and say, wow, we've got cancer.

**Speaker B:** That will be a very high level.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that means that you need to practice for that time.

**Speaker B:** I agree.

**Speaker A:** That's what takes practice, is if you can say aha for the little things, then you can say aha for the big things. But if you say poor me for the little things, and guess what you've got yourself set up for?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like The practice here, I've been more and more paying attention to the small things, you know, in a wholesome way. I realize how the little ways I react to things says a lot about whether my mind is— how quickly it goes to the unwholesome. Um, yeah, it happens a lot.

**Speaker A:** Uh, but, but yeah, it does, like every second or so for most people.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** One little unwholesome thought after another after another, one little unwholesome thought after another after another after another, and then they get used to it, and then they think that's reality, where in fact they invented that reality.

**Speaker B:** It— so that's like a subjective reality, right? Like, like we create this— what we.

**Speaker A:** Mean by subjective reality, you made that subject up. It's not an object, it's not real. That's what the word object actually means. When we say objective, like objective reality means there's something real there, there's an object there. There's Rupa. Yeah, because objective means that you made it up. It's the subject of your story. Yeah, if you can understand that, then you can tell the difference between object and subjective. Yes, either the object is real or it's a subject of your story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because objectively it's never ours, right? Like this, I made it yours.

**Speaker A:** It's your subject. You made it up. It's you who makes it up. Reality is just real, no self there. But when you make up a story, it's about you and a sick body in, in this, uh, example.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I was also thinking, like, making— I was just thinking about how you often say Making every day, seeing through every day through the Dhamma perspective, like every day is the Dharma practice, something like this. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So keep the object, keep reality in the mind as opposed to allowing subjects of stories coming into the mind.

**Speaker B:** Stories coming into the mind. It's like seeing that story coming out and say, I see you, Mara. Like that, I'm creating, entering a new mind state, right? Like, yeah. Yeah, because, uh, it's really wholesome. It feels very wholesome when I can catch that over and over. Uh, it— I'm starting to get a hang of, uh, because I still feel that sometimes, like, I catch it and I start to feel sorry for myself. Oh, that is like— it's like, wait.

**Speaker A:** Why do you hear that phrase? Come back to that statement. Say it again.

**Speaker B:** Uh, catching myself feeling sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, you said sorry for myself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, now listen to that, that you're sorry. Now what does the word sorry mean? Does it mean great? Does it mean wonderful?

**Speaker B:** No, it's not wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Does it mean good enough?

**Speaker B:** No, it doesn't. I don't think so. I don't think so.

**Speaker A:** Sorry and sorrow and sorrowful. Okay. Those are downers. The next one is is for yourself. You feel sorry for yourself. Now, the you that feels the sorrow is different from the self that you feel sorrow for, because the you that has the feeling is a different you than the one that you feel sorry for, because the one you feel sorry for does not exist.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** You made that one up. The self that you feel sorry for is a made-up— that's part of the story. It's also— story is a subject, and the subject is, guess what, me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Now let's phrase it like this: oh, some old man in Thailand is sick. Well, guess what? There may be thousands of some old men in Thailand sick. How about just old men who are sick? How many old men who are sick all over the world?

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe millions, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, are you going to feel that that kind of depth of sorrow for each one of them, or are you going to feel sorry for one of them in particular that is a self?

**Speaker B:** Yes, one of them.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we can also then put that— how about a young man in Asia or in Malaysia? Okay, how many young men in Malaysia are sick? Hundreds, huh? So why do you feel sorry for one of them in particular?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now let's think off into the future. Let's think about 300 to 500 years from now, to where YouTube is down, no more videos. The world has changed completely. It's been 300 years since anybody heard of Ivan, and it's been 300 years since anybody heard of Dhammarato. And now you hear the story, oh, Dhammarato got sick, he got old, and he died. Are you going to feel sorry for a story that's 500 years old? Do you feel sorry for Socrates because he was poisoned? In 390 BC?

**Speaker B:** A little bit, just a little bit. I mean, I mean, for Socrates, and like, I mean, any characters, right? Like even someone that you know and.

**Speaker A:** You read one half, but you don't know Socrates. You never met him. He's always been just a story to you. And in a way, Dhammarato is just a story to you. Yes, especially a story 500 years from now. It's just a story, just a subject, not an object anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so whenever you start to feel sorry for yourself, start thinking about that self that I'm sorry for now was sick 300 years ago. And then it's hard to get sorry for it. Yes, everything is temporary. That's an important quality that a lot of people miss out on in Western Buddhism. Okay, they think that enlightenment is a place that you reach and that you never leave. Achan Po was very, very clear for me. In fact, he teased me about it, saying that becoming a Sotapanna, and then you could become ordinary again. He congratulated me for being a Sotapanna, and then the next time I talked to him, he says everything is temporary. It don't last.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you've seen my, uh, thing before. Let's do it again. Okay, how does one beat a drum?

**Speaker B:** Uh, you just hit it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you— okay, so here's the drum and here's the mallet, and you hit it like this. Yeah, right. And every time you strike the drum, it makes a sound, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** So let's call that sound enlightenment, right? And this is what Westerners do.

**Speaker B:** Oh, they don't really hit it.

**Speaker A:** They never hit it. And if they hit it one time, then they think that they've arrived. They think that they've hit it one time, it's like this, and it's not like that. Yeah, they're back waving their brain in the air. Okay, so we have to practice hitting that drum over and over and over again. In your case, hitting the drum of everything is okay, hitting the drum of wow, this is good. Yes, hitting the drum of wholesome. And when's the best time to hit that drum? As soon as you recognize, oh, I'm sorry for myself. And then you say, no, I'm not. I'm really happy that I'm sick. And you hit it again and you hit it again. Harder, harder. Hit that thing. Take some effort. Put some energy into it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, yeah, it makes more and more sense, uh, the more I practice this. Like, like, it's so interesting because, uh, you know, sometimes I hear people say stuff like, oh, that's, uh, which I disagree, but you know, some people say, oh, that's toxic positivity because you're ignoring the problem.

**Speaker A:** But then I don't There was never a problem anyway. Let's go ahead and ignore it. There was not a problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, because, yeah, it's like this understanding of impermanence, no-self, and the Buddha, Dharma is like, yeah, yeah, it's just seeing all this subject and all these stories is coming. Yeah, yeah, it's just coming to reality. Seeing things really clearly. Yeah, I don't know what happened, it just makes more and more sense to me.

**Speaker A:** Every time you hear the Dhamma, you say, wow, look at how much time I felt sorry for myself. A big waste of time feeling sorry for myself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I remember the Buddha, there's one in the sutta where he say to a woman, like, the amount of anguish or pain you have, the tears could fill up 7 seas or something like that. Like the tears, like, could fill up a sea. And he's very direct with that. And like, through that sharing, the woman somehow come to an understanding and come out of her suffering.

**Speaker A:** There was another one that he let her figure it out for herself. Oh yeah, the story of, uh, uh, uh, what's her name? Uh, something like, uh, uh, Hasi Gotama, something like that. I've forgotten her name, but anyway, she's the story of that her baby died and she couldn't tolerate that. She couldn't stand it. She felt really sorry for herself. And so she carried that dead infant around to every doctor she could find and nobody could do anything. And so she carried it to all of the magicians. She carried it to the religious people. And finally she came to the Buddha. Do you know what the Buddha told her to do? Because he knew that he couldn't tell her. He gave her a job to do, and he says, go collect an anna seed. It's generally translated as a mustard seed, 10 of them. Go get 10 seeds from 10 different households. That have never known death. And she went to house after house after house, but she had to reject their seed because they had known death, probably being pretty sorry for themselves when Grandpa died, feeling pretty sorry for themselves when their child died. And so she, after so much work and effort, could not get even one seed. But what she did get was the knowledge that babies die. She got the knowledge that shit happens. And here Ivan starts to feel bad for himself, and you haven't even had a baby die. Your shit's just little.

**Speaker B:** Shit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's true, isn't it? All your shit's little shit and you still feel sorry for yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, uh, they call it the main character syndrome, like, like in the West, I say. I think they say like, yeah, you're.

**Speaker A:** The main— you're the main character of your life, right? Yeah, yeah, all right. But you're not enjoying that main character. That in fact, if you stop having a main character is the best, or if you start making other people your main character. This is why, uh, very wealthy people— a good example of this is Bill Gates in this century and this time, but before there was, um Henry Ford, Rockefeller, and some of the other barons, robber barons, that after they amassed all their wealth, they were still unhappy. But what they started to do was give the money away. They started philanthropy. And so I mentioned Bill Gates because he started giving away a lot of his wealth, and that's where his joy comes from. Why? Because he's not focused on what he can get anymore. He's focused on sharing with others. So a way to start is go to the hospital, go visit people. Okay, I'll tell you a story about that. In fact, I did that. It was Christmas time, and Christmas is a great big deal in South Carolina. Okay, and so I had access to a Santa Claus costume. Oh, and I put that Santa Claus costume on with a great deal of help from others and went to the hospital and went to the children's ward and made a whole lot of kids happy. They weren't feeling sorry for themselves. If I'd have gone in there as a nun— oh, poor you, oh, you're such a poor kid— then they would have felt sorry for themselves because the nun felt sorry for themselves. But here I am, a fat guy in a costume for Santa Claus, having a ball, giving each kid a gift, bringing joy. And you know what I did after I did that? I went to another floor and did that with adults and got the same reaction. In that regard, laughter is the best medicine, because it didn't matter how many pills those patients got from their doctor, they weren't laughing. All right, so this is one of the ways, and we call that diversion. So instead of having unhappy, unwholesome thoughts about myself— oh, I feel sorry— you can go spread joy to those people who actually have some sorrow. They're actually sick. But there's a step beyond that. The second step is, is that there is nothing. There really is nothing. Did, by the way, did you see the, uh, uh, the image, the, uh, the drawing of the Japanese poem by Ruku?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's actually on the, uh, uh, our Skype Uh, oh yeah, yes, yes, I know that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and what did he say?

**Speaker B:** Uh, both legs stretched out, something like that. Not caring the world.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the things he said in there was let the world take care of itself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S a big one. Okay, to let the world take care of itself. Now here's an example of that. Here we are on the internet making videos, putting up a video channel, having Skype groups, having Discord groups, and having an open Sangha Foundation website. Guess what? How would most people who had that feel? They would feel successful if they got more and more and more and more people.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if nobody joined the website, and if nobody came to the Discord, and nobody was on Skype, what happens? They feel sorry for themselves. So their joy comes from the world. Not from the inside. But when you let the world go and recognize that you've got your own thing going, and the best thing to have is nothing at all, then the next line of that poem says that I've got 10 days of rice and I've got enough sticks for the fireplace. Yes, right. And then he says, I'm just going to listen to the rain. On the roof.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And then he says, and I'm going to sit and relax with my legs out. Now that one I think is a slap in the face of the Zen posture, but it could be all of those cross-legged Asians.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** He's just going to sit happily with his legs out. He's got 10 days full of rice and he's got Nothing but the rain to listen to. Okay, he's got nothing now, literally. And that's where his joy comes from. That's a really, really powerful little poem. Sometimes the entire teaching of the Buddha can be summed up in a little poem like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And like, to go back to what you said about, you know, people feeling sorry for themselves if like no one's joining. It's so interesting because I usually think, from my experience, I've seen it again and again, people that just enjoy doing it and not caring for whether people come or go is usually where a lot of people stay. It's like, I don't know, that's just how I've seen it again and again. Like It's really hard to imagine no people will come. I mean, maybe that's a mundane way of viewing things, but it's just really hard to imagine.

**Speaker A:** But well, who knows what the future is going to be?

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** The question is, can you stop feeling sorry for yourself right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you find enough joy to go spread it to others so that they don't have to feel sorry for themselves. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, it's so interesting because when you're saying like, uh, you know, spreading generosity, helping people, uh, it's like over here in my practice sometimes I could have like some dissatisfaction And then maybe, you know, when I was helping people, right, and I see they are like— I can see really clearly they are the one who's creating their own Dukkha. And, you know, maybe I was just helping them, just talking about it, not really like judging. It's like— and then as I'm spreading the maybe Dharma or something, I'm also just spreading it to myself. Like, because I can see, like, yeah, that person right now is me. Like, it's the same thing. And then I was able to instantly, when I was talking about the Dharma, I instantly remember that, like, the refuge, the joy in this practice. I, like, in the process of helping them, I just feel good myself. Like, not because whether they got help or not, I just remember, like, the effort of generosity itself. I was just remembering. So it's like I'm helping myself. Ultimately, I was thinking about that.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you don't need help. When you say you're helping yourself, listen to this: helping yourself is just the opposite of feeling sorry for yourself. And so you go, sorry, helping myself, sorry, helping myself, sorry, helping myself. The real way of looking at it is, is that you need not help yourself in that way. You need not feel sorry. You're already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Another word that they use, and I've heard this often from members of my own family years ago and in many other places. Oh, you deserve a reward. Oh, you deserve to treat yourself. Here, fat woman, have another ice cream. Yes, go shopping, buy stuff you don't need, treat yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, like, why, why treat yourself? You're already successful, like, like satisfied, like you— everything is already here.

**Speaker A:** And so you're sick, so what?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** In fact, getting sick is a good test. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of when you're sick That's a really good time to practice. Because what's your option? When you're sick, you're either practicing or you're feeling sorry for yourself. What's your choice?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. It also got me remembering, like, you know, I read a lot of this sort of cases where people who have serious illness, either they— well, there's only two options— either they become, like, happier because during their illness they realize how dumb they are, like they're attached to so many unnecessary things, and then it's become happy. Like, they just— like, I hear this so often, like, people say, like, oh, cancer is the best thing that ever happened to me, which is like a crazy thing to say, uh, from a, uh, from a mundane, uh, view, I guess. But it's like, they're really happy. Like, like, they, they discover the joy of just stop caring.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can hear the phone ringing. I pick it up and say, hey boss, I can't come to work today. I was just diagnosed with.

**Speaker B:** Well, let.

**Speaker A:** Me say, hahaha, I got out of that one. I don't have to come to work today because I'm sick. Yeah, so that's wonderful. I'm not feeling bad and not feeling sad and not feeling sorry for myself because I'm sick. I've got a perfect excuse. To not fix the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was looking at the old video because I do it so much. I think it was the second or third call I talked to you. I was like looking at the old video, I was feeling sorry about what I was saying. Like, oh, it was something about like, because, you know, I got laid off from work or something like that and I have so much free time. And I feel sorry for myself, and then you say how nice it is because I got nothing to do, like I can be just so free. And like, well, I was just laughing because it's so true. It's just like, yeah, and then it helps me so much. Like nowadays when I lost an opportunity or something, instead of feeling sorry, I was just immediately, wow, like I can relax right now. I can stop caring. It's just so much joy. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, look how much joy you've gotten now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's true. I feel like this year was so much relief, so much happiness. Sometimes it's scary to say to people because people might think I'm crazy, so I keep my mouth shut. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When you're out in the world, Why not keep your mouth shut? Because you're not going to be able to help them. And if you smile and laugh at them, they'll get angry and start to feel sorry for themselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I have a quick question again about, uh, because you say making every day like a Dharma practice. I was wondering, I know the answer is no, but like, can it be too much? Like, I guess that's a mundane view, right? There's never too much of Dhamma practice because I can't help but to think of like, you know, some like religious nutcase people where, you know, they're talking about Jesus all the time. But I know Dhamma is not religious. So I'm curious.

**Speaker A:** Well, Jesus is not religious either. Listen to some of the things that he has said.

**Speaker B:** I agree.

**Speaker A:** Behold, the kingdom of God is within you. Another one is, behold, the kingdom of God is right in your hands. The kingdom of God is here, it's in your hands. He's also said things like, um, Uh, those who are poor in spirit, which means that they're not prideful, yes, will inherit the Earth. Why? Because all the prideful people are out there fighting with each other, killing each other off, leaving the meek and mild with everything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, one of my favorite from him is like when he said, unless you become like the children of God that you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. And I was like, I keep thinking about it sometimes. Yeah, it's really beautiful. But yeah, since we're talking about Jesus, I have a quick question because this thing really is so interesting because I read something about— because inside, like, his disciple asked him about like why when he every time you know, you're in a crowd of people, you speak in parables. And then he said something about like, uh, uh, I don't know, like, I, I, he, I guess he said, uh, people are not ready for the, this, uh, the kingdom of God, the words, the teaching. So he's speaking in parables.

**Speaker A:** They don't understand direct language is another way of saying it. Well, guess what? Did not the Buddha speak also in parables?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's why.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, every sutta, in fact, in the Majjhima Nikaya is a story behind it, and in that story he tells a parable. And then, and one of the parables, uh, one of the, uh, suttas, I think is number 22, when he says, didn't I tell you the, uh, the metaphor Or the simile about this and that and this one and that one. And I think in that sutta is listed about 100 of them. Simile of the snake, the simile of the raft, the simile of the honey ball, over and over and over and over again, one simile after the other after the other, little stories. Now let me ask you this question. And this one you might have to think about. Do I not also speak in parables?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you do. That's why I like listening to you.

**Speaker A:** Wasn't the story of the Santa Claus costume and in the hospital, wasn't that a parable?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, now that you mentioned that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's how the Dharma is taught. Jesus used it. Now Socrates had a slightly different approach, and sometimes, in fact quite often, I use the Socratic method. And what was his method? Of making people think by guiding them with questions.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** That they would make a statement, he says, well, what about this? And they'll have to move. And then they'll say, what about this? And they'll have to move. And then they'll say, what about this? And they'll have to move. And pretty soon he gets them to the point of understanding.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so have you seen that I ask a lot of questions? Yeah, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, oftentimes it's like halfway through the question, at least for me, it's like I realized, oh, okay, like, yeah, like, okay, I was wrong, like, somewhere. It's like, like, immediately.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so let's cover another point. Jesus, uh, I'll go ahead and tell you a little bit in there. Jesus really screwed up. He did not follow his own teachings at all. When he walks into the temple and he saw the money changers, he didn't like that a little bit, and he started overthrowing the tables. And you can imagine, they're counting their coins and putting it in stacks like that they were at a poker table. Yeah, yeah, okay. And he turned the tables over. Can you imagine somebody at a casino that's got a big stack of, uh, chips in front of them and the table gets turned over and their chips get all over the place with other people picking them up? They don't like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker A:** He drove them out with a, uh, a rope that he used as a whip. He was pretty pissed off, wasn't he?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** How dare you screw with the house of the Lord? Well, guess what? The high priest wanted them in there because he was getting a piece of the action.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So within a week, they, they strung him up. Well, all of those people who had listened to him before and didn't understand his stories, they began to make him— in other words, every time a story is, is told His cross gets higher, and every time the story gets told, it gets higher and higher until he's floating off into the air. All right, and so they've made him into a special kind of Son of God rather than recognizing that you too, and everybody here, is the Son of God, a son of nature. Yeah, without this environment, without all of God and all of God's laws, which includes gravity, it includes the nuclear force, it includes electromagnetic, it includes chemical reactions— all of that stuff is part of nature, part of God, and you're the son of that. So you're a special kind of son of God, just like everybody else. We're all children of God. But oh no, they wanted him to be special. They wanted his cross to grow right up into the air. And that's what made Christianity— that's what made it into a religion. Yeah, a perfectly wonderful Dharma teacher, Jesus, was destroyed, and a Messiah was put in his place. A magical Jesus.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's also— it also feels like the moment they make it special, that it is discarded. That it's almost like, like, you know, once you make it magical, the, the, the, the real core of that, that the— I guess in Dharma they call this the super mundane, right? Like, like that, that real— exactly.

**Speaker A:** Here's something that a lot of people don't understand is that is magic and supernatural are actually mundane.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Where the supramundane, yeah, is above all of that. Why is supramundane? Supramundane is above the mundane and it's going towards reality, where supernatural is just mundane. And so it would be quite natural for ordinary people to treat Jesus as special. But if anybody had actually understood what Jesus was saying, then we would have a Bhikkhu Sangha of Christianity. Yeah, but Jesus was not around long enough, nor did he tell parables well enough to where his message actually got through.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the Buddha was around teaching for 45 years, and he got a lot of people who understood his parables. And because of that, we've had a real Bhikkhu Sangha that's lasted 2,500 years, and the teaching of the Buddha is still alive. Yeah, to be transmitted to those who can hear. And so many of them want to worship their guru instead. They want to make their guru magical and special.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's kind of like an insult to the teaching once you make it magical, because people get attached to the magical, you know. But at least for me here in Malaysia Like, surprisingly, like, I was a Buddhist for the first 17 years of my life, but I never heard of the Four Noble Truths or the Eightfold Path, or like, like, oh, like, you know, at least here a lot of people attach to the magical things, right?

**Speaker A:** And guess what? Nobody gets any real magic, so everybody wants magic and nobody gets it. Leaves them in the state of wanting something they can't have, and they're dissatisfied with that. Yeah, when you stop wanting things that you can't have, like for instance, you're sick and you want to be well— oh, poor me, I feel sorry for poor me— because you want to feel well. But if it's okay that you're sick, then you don't want something that you can't have. You're quite satisfied with what you do have, and that's the real thing that takes you above the ordinary into the supramundane. The ordinary mundane world wants things they can't have, and the supramundane is stop wanting things that you can't have and really enjoy the things that you do have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what is here, right here, right now? Just keep being more immersed.

**Speaker A:** So can you remember that you're okay? You've already got everything you need.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, yeah, that's definitely true. I just keep practicing. It's so funny, sometimes I have questions, right? Then I go practice and suddenly the question just goes away. It happens so much lately. And then I was like, I was like, I need to understand this. But then when I sit down, right, I just relax. It's like, wait, what's the question again? It's like, it's just a thought. It's like so fast. It's so fast. Dhammarato, there's a quick one. You know, like your Skype status, you say any mood will do now. I was curious, you often talk about, you know, we have a choice in how we feel. Is that the same thing, or is it different?

**Speaker A:** It depends upon how you translate the word mood. Now, okay, uh, many, many years ago, they, uh, they had a kind of a stone or a chemical rock that would change colors upon temperature.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** And they would put it in a ring and sell them for a high price. And it was called a mood stone or a mood ring.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And the people would look at the ring and say what kind of mood that you're in. And the reality is, is that it doesn't matter what color the ring is, you're okay. So that's where that real point about the mood came from. Any mood will do.

**Speaker B:** Because it's not important, right?

**Speaker A:** I guess because what mood you're in is not important. And in fact, most people get moody when they think that, oh, I have to feel sorry for myself, and that's just another mood.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, I just realized, like, the word moody is not good. People say they are moody. It's never It's never good. Why is it associated with bad feeling? Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so it's a joke. Any mood will do is just a joke.

**Speaker B:** I see. Okay, okay. Wow. Well, it's kind of deep, but at the same time there's nothing there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, there's nothing to it. Any mood will do.

**Speaker B:** Any mood will do. Kind of empty, like everything.

**Speaker A:** I've only been asked about that 3 or 4 times, and it's been up on the, uh, on the Skype group for 10 years or so.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I'm the fourth nosy one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, any mood will do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Still, I have to investigate this, like, after this call. Like, all right, so much good stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's go ahead and finish now so that you can go do that with that great big smile you're wearing right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, how nice it is.

**Speaker A:** All right, Ivan, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. See you. Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** Anyone will do. Anyone will do.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B, Ivan), centers on **how to stop creating unnecessary mental suffering by identifying and abandoning unwholesome thought patterns, especially self-pity.**

Here is a structured summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: The Habit of Self-Pity**
*   The discussion begins with the common tendency to mentally suffer *because of* physical illness or discomfort. Dhammarato identifies this as an **old, conditioned habit**—often learned in childhood—where we feel we *should* be mentally distressed when the body is sick.
*   This creates a "subjective reality"—a personal story of "poor me"—that is mistaken for objective truth.

### **The Practice: Catching and Changing the Story**
*   **Awareness (Catching It):** The first step is to recognize the moment the mind begins to weave a story of self-pity ("I'm sick, I should feel bad").
*   **Investigation (Seeing Through It):** Examine the thought. Who is this "self" you feel sorry for? The talk deconstructs this by pointing out:
    *   You wouldn't feel the same depth of sorrow for millions of other sick people.
    *   In 500 years, your current situation will just be an impersonal story.
    *   Therefore, the "self" in your story is a mental construct, not an enduring reality.
*   **Substitution (Hitting the Drum):** Actively replace the unwholesome thought with a wholesome one. This is compared to **striking a drum**.
    *   When you notice self-pity, consciously think, "Wow, this is good. I can be happy even while sick."
    *   This requires effort and repetition to build a new habit.

### **Key Insights and Methods**
1.  **Start Small:** Practice on minor irritations. If you say "poor me" for little things, you'll be set up to do it for big things. Catching small reactions trains the mind.
2.  **Use Impermanence & Not-Self:** See your situation as temporary and impersonal. This undermines the fuel for self-pity.
3.  **Generosity as Antidote:** Shift focus from your own story to helping others. The example of visiting a hospital as a joyful Santa Claus illustrates how spreading joy dispels one's own sorrow.
4.  **The Joy of "Nothing":** Ultimate peace comes from needing nothing extra, like the poet who finds contentment with just rice, firewood, and the sound of rain. Happiness is internal, not dependent on external conditions (like website traffic or followers).
5.  **Sickness as Opportunity:** Physical illness is a prime time to practice, as it starkly presents the choice: practice wholesome mental states or indulge in self-pity.

### **Broader Philosophical Points**
*   **Objective vs. Subjective Reality:** Objective reality (*rupa*) is just "what is." Suffering arises from the **subjective stories** we layer on top of it.
*   **Supramundane vs. Supernatural:** True Dhamma practice is **supramundane** (seeing ultimate reality: impermanence, not-self, suffering). Getting attached to magical thinking or making teachers into gods is still **mundane** and misses the point.
*   **Parallels with Other Teachings:** The talk draws parallels with Jesus's parables and Socrates' questioning method, noting that all true teachings point to an internal freedom, which is often lost when the teacher is worshiped as a magical figure instead.

### **Conclusion: The Takeaway**
The essence of the practice is to **stop wanting what you don't have (like perfect health) and fully appreciate what you do have.** By repeatedly "hitting the drum" of wholesome understanding, you can see through the stories of self-pity and discover that **you are already okay**, regardless of circumstances. The final playful note—"Any mood will do"—reinforces that no mental state is inherently an obstacle; freedom comes from not being troubled by any of them.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speakers use several powerful metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about mental habits, suffering, and perspective. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Chart" and Being Your Own Doctor:** Speaker A suggests you should "be your own doctor. Look at your own chart." The "chart" represents your thoughts and self-narrative. By examining it objectively (like a doctor), you can diagnose unhelpful thought patterns and choose a different, more wholesome reaction instead of blindly identifying with the "diagnosis" (e.g., "I'm sick, so I must feel bad").

2.  **Hitting the Drum of Enlightenment:** This is a central metaphor for practice. Enlightenment is not a permanent state you "arrive" at. Instead, it's like the sound made by striking a drum. Westerners are depicted as never hitting it or hitting it once and thinking they're done. True practice is "hitting that drum over and over and over again"—consciously choosing wholesome states (like "everything is okay" or "wow, this is good") each time you notice an unwholesome thought.

3.  **Objective Reality vs. Subjective Stories (Object vs. Subject):** The speakers distinguish between objective reality (what is real, "Rupa," without a self) and the subjective stories we create. Our suffering arises from the "subjects" we invent—the stories about "me" and "my problem." Letting go of the story and returning to the bare "object" (reality as it is) is the path to freedom.

4.  **Main Character Syndrome:** Speaker B introduces this modern term, which perfectly encapsulates the earlier discussion. We cast ourselves as the "main character" in a dramatic story of suffering (e.g., "poor me"). The practice involves seeing through this self-centered narrative.

5.  **Little Shit vs. Big Shit:** Speaker A bluntly contrasts Ivan's worries with profound suffering (like a child dying), calling them "little shit." The point is that the mental habit of "feeling sorry for yourself" is the same whether the trigger is small or large. If you practice with the "little shit," you'll be prepared for the "big shit."

6.  **The Mood Ring:** In closing, Speaker A explains his Skype status ("any mood will do") with a reference to mood rings. The color (mood) is irrelevant because "you're okay" regardless. It's a joke underscoring that we don't need to be controlled by or attached to any particular emotional state.

### **Stories & Parables**

1.  **The Child Falling Down:** Speaker B offers the common observation that a child looks to a caregiver's reaction after falling. If the adult is worried, the child cries; if the adult is calm ("like an Anagami, non-reactively"), the child gets up and keeps playing. This story illustrates how we learn and internalize reactive habits from others.

2.  **The Doctor's Demeanor:** Speaker A extends the idea: Imagine a doctor entering your room laughing vs. looking glum while reading your chart. The doctor's attitude directly affects the patient's mental state. This reinforces the power of external influences and, conversely, the power of being your own "doctor" with a good demeanor.

3.  **Kisa Gotami and the Mustard Seed:** Speaker A recounts this famous Buddhist story (though he forgets the name). A woman, Kisa Gotami, whose child died, is asked by the Buddha to fetch a mustard seed from a home that has never known death. She cannot find one, and in the process, realizes the universality of death and overcomes her personal grief. The story teaches the liberating insight of impermanence and shared human experience, breaking the spell of personal sorrow.

4.  **Santa Claus at the Hospital:** Speaker A shares a personal story of wearing a Santa Claus costume to visit sick children and adults in a hospital on Christmas. By bringing joy and laughter, he "diverted" their attention from self-pity. This story is a parable for the practice of **diversion**—replacing self-focused sorrow with outward-focused generosity and joy.

5.  **The Japanese Poem by Ryōkan (likely referenced):** Speaker A describes a poem (attributed to "Ruku," likely the Zen monk **Ryōkan**) about having "10 days of rice," enough firewood, and just listening to the rain with legs stretched out. This is a parable for **contentment with simplicity** and "letting the world take care of itself," finding joy in having nothing and wanting nothing.

6.  **Jesus and the Money Changers:** Speaker A uses this Biblical story as a cautionary tale. He argues that Jesus, a potentially great Dharma teacher, failed to follow his own teachings (non-anger) when he overturned the money changers' tables, leading to his execution. This story illustrates how a teacher's message can be distorted after their death, turning them into a magical figure (a "Messiah") rather than leaving a practical, practice-oriented community (like the Buddhist Sangha).

7.  **The Robber Barons and Philanthropy:** The story of wealthy industrialists (Rockefeller, Ford) and modern figures like Bill Gates finding joy in giving away wealth is used as a parable. It illustrates the shift from **self-centered acquisition** to **other-centered generosity** as a source of true happiness.

### **Overall Narrative Arc:**
The talk itself is a **metaphor for Dharma teaching**. Speaker A explicitly notes that he, like the Buddha and Jesus, teaches in parables and uses the Socratic method (asking guiding questions). The conversation models the process of using everyday examples, personal stories, and classic tales to guide someone from a state of identifying with suffering ("feeling sorry for myself") to a perspective of freedom, choice, and contentment.
