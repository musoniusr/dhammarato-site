### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, looks like it's recording.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so Marcus, it's really good to see you again. It's been a while and I'm glad to see you. So you've got a— you started off with a question talking about your— first off, you're talking about how good your practice is, and I wanted to say that I note that. So go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so on the Dharma Discord, there was someone who, you know, there's this question section. And so someone had posted a question about listening to music on the path and whether that's something that's good or whether that's something that's not good. And a bunch of people gave their responses. And then I kind of started thinking like, how I view this thing, because I sometimes also— well, I don't listen to too much music, but I do listen to music when I go running, because I found it sort of, you know, distracts the mind from some uncomfortable sensations. And whether that's good or bad, I guess we'll get to.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's a question for you: why is it even or ever a question? What's the point? I mean, why are people out pointing fingers and saying other people are bad and this and that thing, like music is bad? I mean, where do all you guys come from? All of this, it sounds Christian, except the Christian churches are generally pretty musical. So where does all of this come from? I'm teasing you, of course.

**Speaker A:** Course.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but give me an answer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. So, so I think where it's coming from is, you know, this idea of, of sensual pleasures and craving for sensual pleasures.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, well, is craving and listening the same thing?

**Speaker A:** Well, not inherently, but, uh, Okay, so.

**Speaker B:** We can at least start there, because remember, the teachings of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, not music and no music. That's not what's there. That in fact, what we know of music did not exist in the time of the Buddha. That as a musician, going through college and all of that and getting exposed to the history of music, as well as Disney did their best to try to point it out about where percussion and where reeds and where stringed instruments came from and what are octaves and fifths and all of that. And none of that information was available in the time of the Buddha. The best that they could do is have— and I've heard it because I've been to Asia— stuff, some tinky-tinky-tinky where none of the musical instruments are tuned and they're mostly just banging around, but they do it in great celebration. All right, so the first thing that we can say is whatever we think of as music now did not exist in the time of the Buddha, just like automobiles and cell phones. So there's a whole lot of questionable things because there's a whole lot of questionable people asking questions instead of thinking things through and figuring out what the Buddha would actually do. And generally, cell phones are no problem. Most of the monks have them. Basically, I would say that the monks who were monks before cell phones don't have them, and the monks who became monks after they had already gotten a cell phone kept them. That's also true for automobiles, and I've seen that happen, that there are some monks that because of inheritance or family, or that they had the car before they joined the Sangha, and then in the West they keep it. And so a lot of the monks drive cars, they maintain them. Including the license and all of that kind of stuff, and drive around. But most monks in the US don't, because they never learned to drive and they came from Asia without a driver's license and without a car. And so now that they're in the Sangha, they kind of, okay, so they're beginning to build up this idea of status quo. That what was there before, and then becoming a monk, is going to continue to be there unless there's actually an injunction about it. There's also the issue of the automobile from the perspective of that the Buddha had an injunction against abusive animals, including riding on them, or riding in a cart that's being pulled like one. However, the Buddha quite much allowed, and in fact there's quite a bit of the situation back in the time of the Buddha, small boats, rafts, even talks about building rafts. There's a simile of the raft, or a boat, or something. This is what Hinayana and Mahayana is all about, the big boat and the little boat, right? So we've got it pretty well that the Buddha was not against boats, but he was against riding on animals. So when the automobile comes along, just because it replaced the horse doesn't mean that it's now a new kind of a horse. But rather it's much more like a boat. And because it's like a boat, it would be more permissible than if it were actually like an animal. But unfortunately, the automobiles don't have pumping hearts and eyes like a horse. Sometimes a horse will keep you out of trouble to where the boat and the car are not.

**Speaker A:** That's true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so we're going in the right direction. Right now, let's talk about— actually, it's in— we know about this kind of stuff from two particular places. One would be in the precepts, especially the higher precepts, as well as the Pātimokkha itself. And yet, believe me, almost all, without maybe one exception, All of the people who are asking about music are not even ordained. Why are they asking these questions? That's a good question, you know. Why are they asking about this? Because they're not even ordained. But let's go see now under the issue of being ordained, or at least in the higher precepts. The precept is: Nacha gita vattita vi Sukkha dasana wei Rāmānī Sakābadhamma Samadhi ��mī. Okay, let's do it again. Nacha, dancing. Gita. Now what is Gita? Okay, well, let's just leave it as singing. And then we have to learn that the nacha and the gita are about the vasukidasana. Now what is the vasukha? We know the vi, like in Vipassana and other things like this going into. And then you have the word sukha. That's your sensual pleasures. And then Dasana, or Dasa, like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that's the word for slavery. So, what it's really saying is, the Vasukha Dasana, or the Vasukha, is actually public performances, where you go into, in order to get your pleasure, for dancing and singing. Okay, so let's look, for instance, at the— at an opera, because operas have a whole lot of dancing and singing, right? So the situation with the opera is— and this is actually, um, a video on YouTube to where at the beginning of the video, before the opera starts, the Pope And a large retinue, including cardinals and whatever, come parading, literally parading, into the balcony in their area with a great big fancy seat for all of that. And everybody in the audience stands up, turns around, and gives the Pope respect. I guess this is in India, in Italy or something. Okay, and then the Pope sits down and gives the nod that he can give the attention back to the director of the orchestra so that the show can go on. Right? There are several problems with all of that.

**Speaker A:** One.

**Speaker B:** The Buddha, if he's going to go to a show, a public performance, he's the one who's going to be on the stage. In this situation, the Pope was not on the stage, and he should have been. If he was a real Pope, he would have not visited an opera, because that puts him out of the Pope ship, down to just an ordinary gawker. He becomes a gawker. He's— that's what he is, okay? And this is what the Buddha did not allow was for the monks to go to public performances where they are not the center of attention. Wow, that kind of turns things on its head, doesn't it? Not only that, but the whole point about these public performances of dancing and singing that was done way back when was almost always sexually oriented. Okay, but music by itself is not either sexually oriented, nor does it have to be, as you and I were talking before, about addicted to it, or a slave to it, or a requirement. Because in fact, I have seen some kids do get addicted, that they've got the headphones on all the time and they're not paying attention to anything else, other than being selective about when they're listening to music. So, now we can say, well, there's also the quality of, are we going to add wisdom to it and figure out what kind of music is worth listening to? What's worthy of our attention? And the answer to that would then be how we feel. So if we've got exciting music, we're going to feel excited. If we're listening to sexual music, we're going to get sexualized. In fact, that whole idea of the sensual. But there's also, let us say, things that can be soothing. A lot of stuff would be like that, but I would give you, um, uh, old Brahms' Lullaby as an example. Why? Because that's one that's famous for putting kids to sleep, settling things down, right? But, uh, there's a whole class of music that is like that. So the question is, well, what kind of music are we listening to? There's also the kind of music that in fact it just came to mind, and that is the Village People, YMCA. Do you know that one? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. It's got a very— I know some people because of other things have turned it into a gay thing, but actually the lyrics is really, really upbeat in the sense of giving young men a place to go and meet friends and all of that kind of stuff is built into the lyrics. While, to be honest with you, it's got a really fantastic bass part. Because I was an old bass player before, so. And so we can find things like that, and find value out of it. And that there is a great deal of value in music, that in fact the whole study of it had to do— an example of that was that a number of the old musicians were or let us say, at least in their day, and now the people who do remember them, remember them as their association with the church. Franz Liszt, for instance, was almost a monk and lived in a church. And he spent his time either meditating, or practicing piano, or writing stuff. And he became known in those days as possibly the best keyboardist alive. Another one would be John Sebastian Bach, also a church boy. I mean, who else has got an organ for him to go play on? All right, so there's this whole religious quality to it that does have uplifting qualities to it, as well as consolation for the ordinary people. When they're grieving. So there's a lot of music that's built around— that's actually called soothing, but it's funeral music. Go to any funeral home, and in the old days they had this long, long tape on this long, long tape recorder so that they keep it playing for hours and hours and hours of church music and religious music and church and Funeral music, right? And so we have that whole— we've got all of these various genres, and we can have the wisdom as to which one is appropriate for the time, because that's what the music is all about, is that it can. Now, the next thing is, is that everything is music when it's in tune and in rhythm, and everything is noise when it does not guard its frequency doors, nor does it check its rhythm. And that's the thing that we don't like, like noisy neighbors or noise in general. We don't like noise, but the quality of music is, at least if it's gotten recorded and put out in the internet, that the guys who did this music bothered to tune their instruments together before they started to play. Play, that that's absolutely essential, is to get in tune with musical instruments. Guess what? That's the whole point of the Dharma anyway, is for us to get in tune with nature, to get in tune with reality, to become one with it, to harmonize, as opposed to being in discord, disharmony. And so music does have spiritual and/or Dharma value. It can actually help. There's actually meditation music. You hear that in Asian music with the flute. There's a drawing at Wat Soan Mu that has the caption that the music of the flute returns to the forest. With the music. So they go into the forest, they cut the bamboo down, they turn it into a flute whistle, and now the music goes back to the forest. Everything's in cycles like that. So when you see those kind of things like that, you don't hear this, "Oh no, no, no, no, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad," because that's the way that the Western mind works. We've been told to shun things, that if we don't know and we don't understand, we should at least hate it, or generally at least be afraid of it, rather than be curious. And so this is why so many of the Western Buddhists have gotten all, let us say, their musical instrument out of tune, or their nose out of joint. Over is music allowed or not, when in fact there's nobody setting any rules, they're not even ordained. Why are they, you know, playing these games with themselves? Is it because they're trying to do the right thing? Would that be the case?

**Speaker A:** I think the thought process has something to do with this idea of whether when they engage in, you know, activities through the senses, would it be like music which you hear, or food, or anything like that. I think the worry they would have is whether they are sort of, you know, feeding this cycle of desire if they engage in these activities. Okay.

**Speaker B:** In other words, they don't have a clue about what they're talking about. All right, let's go for food for just a moment. Okay, and that one of the places where the food is actually talked about is in the sense of the four requirements, that food is an actual requirement. Now, one of the things about these four requirements is, is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, in his wisdom, added on his own for modern times, not for the time of the Buddha, but in modern times, he added one. So that he sees that there's 5 requirements. He used the word, because it was translated wrongly, as "entertainment," and I would use the term "time structuring." And then, I will go so far as to add a 6th item of requisites, and that is right transportation. Because in the time of the Buddha, the feet were all the transportation he needed. Times have changed. All right, so going back then to these four requisites, food being one of them, we say it— in fact, in the sutta it says, with wise reflection, we will eat this food, not for beautification or aggrandizing the body, but only for the nourishment and the upkeep of the body. So that we do not bring on new bad feelings and we eliminate old ones, that we can in fact get rid of, because we can get rid of the hunger by having something to eat, but if we eat too much, now we're going to be bloated and over-full. So that's a quick example of that. So, the wise reflection also goes into the sense of the way that the monks eat. They always eat in silence. Monks don't talk while they're eating. And I recommend other people, when they're around the house here— the Thai people, when they're talking in Thai, they can go do what they want to do, but they generally do it also because it's part of the culture. But Westerners tend, when they come in to eat, they tend to not keep their mouth shut. They've got to talk often, even while they've got food in their mouth, which is a big no-no, uh, in the Patti Mokk etiquette. That basically the etiquette is to not have too big a thing. In other words, you don't fill that big spoon all the way up. That it's got to be a small or a middle-sized morsel. You put it in and then you pay attention to and chew it properly, moving the parts of the food around in the mouth, sucking the juice out and swallowing it, and continuing to pound with your teeth on the pulp or onto the fibrous parts until there's not even one grain of rice left. And after we clear the mouth out, checking it with the tongue to make sure that nothing is left, then we put the hand now finally back in the bowl. You see, most people when they're eating, they're playing with their food rather than eating, or they're talking rather than eating. But here we've got this clear example of that. When you're eating, let's make sure that we're eating. Oh, this is interesting. Hungry.

**Speaker A:** Okay, sorry.

**Speaker B:** About that. We'll take care of that call later. Um, because of technical difficulties, the, the ringing of Skype on the other computer was just pounding in the ears and you can't hear anything. So I turned the connection— I turned the connection between that computer and this one off. Oh, okay, okay. All right, so That way I can think again. So, anyway, back to this point about the music and the people who are looking for issues. We can use this issue of food as a very, very clear example for music, as in a form of entertainment. All right, now possibly the way that I would start with is in Buddhism we tend to teach the people to stay out of politics, to don't go off into politics. Why? Because there's great dangers there. In fact, all of the people who are talking politics are talking about it from the perspective is that they want you to believe their crapola and to feel the same way that they do, so that you'll join their cause and go make trouble big time. That's the whole point of politics. You see the Republicans and Democrats, you see the Romanians, and everybody's doing that. That's what politics is all about. In fact, you could think of politics in the sense of poly means the word many. And what that means is, is that do you really want to have many bloodsuckers all over you and go into politics. So in that regard, that's not the same thing as saying don't hear any of it. It means don't go into it. Ah, Jesus said something like being in the world but not of the world. So that in fact, you can allow your ears to hear the politics, you just know that it's all crap, and you don't buy any of it, you don't carry any of it, you just enjoy the show, because that's all they are, are just actors on a stage. And then we can do that same thing to music, that music is really just a bunch of actors on a stage. And that you can enjoy and appreciate it, but you don't have to get stuck in it. You can see the value and the meaning, you can see exactly which direction the music is taking in a feeling sense. And in fact, almost all of the music has exactly the same perspective as the politics, and that is that it's designed to make you feel a certain way. In fact, we've already covered this earlier, so now we're back full circle about being careful about what kind of music that you're listening to, because of how it affects you. So in that regard, that also means that when it does affect you, know how the music itself is affecting you, because it can be quite spectacular. Here's an example of that, is that recently I was listening, just by chance, a young Asian woman on stage playing Rhapsody in Blue. Now, a little history of that: I had a friend who was doing the piano part, and he wanted me to play the orchestral part on the piano, and so he and I performed that thing a lot. I know every note about it. And in fact, I recognized, because it's just how I am, I noticed 5 mistakes she made. But nobody cares about the mistakes that she made, because the joy was that she was really enjoying what she was doing. She was well-rehearsed, well-practiced, and she was animated. She actually enjoyed what she was doing. She was beyond the getting every note right. And that can be sane. So, is the musician actually vibing with and thriving on the music that they're playing, being in touch with it, in tune with it, in fact playing the music, as opposed to knowing it well and carefully performing it? Because there's a big difference between a performance and a play. Because the whole world is a play. The whole— they call it Sila in the Hindi language, that everything is just dancing. There's a great big dance going on, except for humans. We think that it's a march, and in fact the world is working in a waltz. The trees flow with the wind and everything just moves in in harmony. It's the humans that have gotten ourselves out of harmony. And so actually getting back into some music would be advisable. To start really listening and paying attention, to start learning how the— by watching the videos you can see how the orchestras work together, that they cooperate. You can see that also on stage bands like we mentioned YMCA. Those guys, they practice, they rehearse, and while they're on stage, they're enjoying the heck out of it. And so you can enjoy that along with them. You can share that joy. This is Mudita, or the sympathetic joy. But you can also just turn the YMCA off. You don't have to get addicted to it. All right, we don't have to become a slave to entertainment. We could just enjoy it, pay close attention to it, especially close attention to how it makes you feel. And then it's Dhamma. Watch closely now. Whatever sensory input comes pay close attention. But this has been greatly, greatly confused in the Western mind about, "Oh, Nacha Gita, Vajrayana, Sukkha, Dhammarato, that means thou shalt not listen to music ever." Just remember this: there was a monk named Brian who was at Wat Soi Monkh, and he left shortly after I arrived, and one of the things that he said to me is that he actually let us say, tricked Achan Po in the sense of, please listen to just one full piece of music. Achan Po never heard music before, he'd been a monk his whole life, from childhood. And so, Brian got Achan Po to actually listen all the way through Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, one of the longest pieces of music. In fact, when the CDs first were arriving, The standard was, we got to be able to put Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one side of one CD. If we can't get it, it's not going to do, because, you know, in the 78 world, there's like 8 or 10 records you got to change to get through the whole symphony. Okay. So, you know, like an hour, an hour and 10 minutes, maybe 90, you know, something like that. And the Dachanpo listened all the way through it, especially the part of The road to joy. And then the conversation between Ajahn Po and Brian was, is that this is wholesome. This is not what the Buddha was against. This is what we can bring right into the wat, but you could not bring that whole orchestra, nor would you want either Ajahn Po or any other monk They've got a symphony orchestra in Bangkok; I bet you there has never been a monk at any performance that has ever occurred by the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. Never would a monk be there, but I bet their music is heard by monks. That's the distinction, you see, that we have now in my lifetime. In fact, when I was 4 years old, my daddy got the first tape recorder in town, in order to tape the preacher's sermons. You know, 1950, we're talking about way back when, because before that they were all wire recorders and there were only a few of them because of the war. So, and before that they only had vinyl, or they also had— it's a kind of video. In fact, in the movies, the talkies, when the talkies came in, they would have a photocell that would go along a piece of film that was moving. And then later they could move that film along the same thing and get a photoreceptor and connect it to a speaker, and you could actually hear it. It works exactly the way physically that.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker B:** Vinyl needle systems work, right? So before that, for hundreds of years, if you wanted to listen to music, you had to go to a live performance. That's the only place that it was available. You could not go— it's only in your lifetime that you can walk around with a set of headphones. Back in the day, you had to have a boombox. Back in the day, you had to carry around something like this to get anything out of it. Now you've got it with those new magnets that are so powerful. The new rare earth magnets are what makes those headphones that you've got sound so gorgeous. Before, it took big heavy magnets, and so everybody in the old days, they had great big speakers in their house, and they don't have those anymore. You know why? Magnets are better now. You don't have to have a magnet this big with a voice coil that big and then a big speaker that big, that you can do all of that right inside the headphones. So, look at the fact that we've got a technology now that didn't exist in the time of the Buddha. We even have SD cards and all kinds of ways of transmitting music, and there's been basically a music explosion. Because up until recently, Hollywood controlled all of the music and the radio stations and all of that, but now that the web has come out, there's been an explosion. Of artists, explosions of music, explosions of recorded music, even with the video. And so very, very rarely, only occasionally— in fact, it's a big deal when a band goes on tour because it's a lot of work, and most of their profits are made by just people listening to their music rather than going to their concerts. So when you understand it like that, you can say, well, of course the Buddha would have been against monks going to any kind of concerts. And that's what this is all about, not the music itself, because the music that you're listening to, the Buddha never heard that. He don't know what it is. And the circumstances that's in the Vinaya is also the circumstances of the guys getting caught going to the musical. Going to the show and coming back and getting questioned, "Well, where you been tonight? What are you doing?" You know, that's the whole— and it had nothing to do with music. So I hope that that gives you a fairly complete answer to this, so that you can begin to figure out what you're going to do about music on your own. As you can probably tell, I have not given it up, and to be honest with you, I did. That in fact I was still in India when the guitar got in such bad condition with the neck glued back together and all of that, that I finally gave it away on my way to Thailand. And so I kind of gave up on the music as I was becoming a monk. And it wasn't until 20, 30 years later when all of that musical stuff that I'd had as a child ripened, that now I can see the beauty, the joy, etc., in the music. Without having to have the rule system in place. And that's the problem with the Westerners, is they want to write a rule about things so that they'll know what to do. "Oh, it's sensual desire, let's write a rule about you can't listen to music," when in fact you can get into a really, really nice state if you listen to the right music, and you can get into a really bad state if you listen to the wrong music. So I would say that not the music as a general quality. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I think maybe the thing that sort of— the reason why this doubt arose in me is because, well, in the past, I mean, like, you know, years ago when I was in a much less wholesome state, one might say, I remember that, you know, my relationship with entertainment was sort of always this sort of escape from the bad feelings I was feeling. And so I kind of feel like there is still this sort of pattern or attitude inside me where I feel like I'm sort of used to using these things in an unwholesome way. And because of that, I've been sort of, I guess, avoidant, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I can understand that. Because if you go back to music and you go back into those unwholesome states, and of course you want to avoid that. But the other possibility is, take a good look at it, take a close look at how you feel with particular music. Go get some new music, go get some happy music to listen to. Much of the modern music that we have today has roots in what? Gangster rap, hard metal, hard this and that, um, explosions on stage, visual, um, uh, ridiculousness and all of that. Gotten quite a lot away from the music. But back in the day, let us say Elvis, a lot of the Elvis music would be wholesome. A lot of the Beatles music would be wholesome. But you got to pay attention to figure out whether it's wholesome or not. Yeah, I.

**Speaker A:** Think it's like even then I don't know if it was necessarily— well, I guess yeah, the content of some of the entertainment I was consuming was definitely unwholesome. But I think like the bigger sort of issue I was having was like I remember pretty clearly that I couldn't stand being without some kind of external stimulation. So even this idea of waking up in the morning, sitting behind a table, having a meal without watching something or listening to something would make me so anxious I couldn't stand it. And so I sort of used it as an escape or sort of as a distraction, I would say.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but then there came a time when either you saw that or the circumstances changed, and now you're not doing that anymore. You don't wake up now thirsting for music or thirsting for some sound. And when you were saying that, by the way, I can imagine that it really doesn't have anything to do with music per se as music, but rather that people have to have something going on. Like the television, the background, or having the internet play something even though they're not listening to it. At least it's there in the background because they're used to it and comfortable with it. And so when they do without it, they're missing something. So that's the other thing, is that when you come to not listening to music and you're missing it, check out that missing. That feeling of missing it. Because it's not so bad to put music on if you're missing it. What's the problem is missing it and not knowing and blaming the music, rather than missing is missing. So paying attention to what's going on within your own mind is the important thing, not the music itself, but yet the music, like any sports, or any news, or any television, is all designed one way or the other to make you feel in a certain way. Do they have the ability to control your feelings, or do you control your feelings? Because this is kind of a test. I can watch Donald Trump and not even get angry, not even a little bit, and I think that that's an actual talent. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S a good challenge. So.

**Speaker B:** That'S the way that we can look at it, is to say that we don't depend— see, when you were talking about it that way, you depended upon that music. Now you don't depend upon it, that you can rise right above it, that the strength comes from not being attached to it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I think sometimes, sometimes still there are these times when there's sort of a restlessness in me, and, and I think, I think the concern that comes up then is like me not wanting to sort of depend on external things in order to create a wholesome state. So we're sort of this— well, you.

**Speaker B:** Talk yourself into it whether you've got the music or not. You've heard the story about music that salves the savage beast. Have you ever heard of that phrase?

**Speaker A:** No, I don't think so.

**Speaker B:** It's an old one. Okay, but think about it like that. Okay, the music that soothes the savage beast. Is what you're looking for. You're looking for music that's going to, you know, fix you and make you feel a certain way, rather than recognizing you're the one who chooses to feel that way with that particular music. So back to the point is, is that you are in charge of your feelings. Pay close attention to that so that you don't feel the way that the music tells you to feel. You've got a choice about how you feel, and you can experiment with that. That basically, when I'm listening for music, to be honest with you, I'm looking for Dhamma. I'm looking for the Dhamma. What kind of lessons do we see in this music that I can pass on to my students? Or look at that particular guy doing that particular thing. That's the kind. So, we can do that also, listening to music with kind of a Dhamma eye. What is the goal of this music? Why does it do it the way that it does? How does the artist respond to the music that they're playing, etc., like that? I mean, we're talking about a deep psychological investigation of the music and all the with this doing, as opposed to just getting lost in it with your own pleasure and not looking at what's going on. Investigate. Investigate your mind with the music and investigate the music and the effect that the music has on the mind. And if we can do that, and then now this is a beautiful Dhamma instrument. Why would we rule it out just in general, make some stupid rule about something? That's almost like the Mormons making rules against tea and coffee, but that was done 100 years ago, and now they're all Coca-Cola addicts because there's no rule against it. So that's the way— don't go for rules, go for experimentation. Go for observation, go for noticing what the effects are. Become wise, become the boss of the music, rather than the victim of the music. So what do you think about that? I.

**Speaker A:** Think it's a good point that like in terms of we sort of, that like in actuality, like it's not the sensual objects that make us feel a certain way, but it's us sort of creating our own state, but we just associate them, or we associate it with a certain thing. So when we're ignorant or when we're unconscious, we will think that, well, this thing made me feel that way. But actually, we're sort of simply, we're doing something with our mind while we're exposed to something, right? So if it's quote-unquote unwholesome music, what's actually going on is that we are using our mind in an unwholesome way while we're having that experience. And so likewise, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so you've got it. All right, so now whenever this kind of question comes up, you've got good answers for it. It just might take you an hour to write, because it's not an easy position when we're taking it out of the rules and putting it into investigation. So that's the thing, is that don't make rules about music, make investigations of it. So that could be the way to say it in short. That's a one-liner. Okay, Marcus, well, I think we've had enough. You have any— no burning questions, I suppose?

**Speaker A:** No, no, I'll leave the other questions for the next time.

**Speaker B:** Yes, call again. It's been a while. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** All right, to discuss the Dharma. Yes, everyone, it is excellent.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll see you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student (Speaker A), explores the question of whether listening to music is compatible with Buddhist practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Argument: Investigation Over Rules**
Dhammarato strongly argues against creating rigid, blanket rules (like "music is bad") from the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha's framework is about **Dukkha (suffering) and its cessation**, not about banning modern phenomena. Since modern music didn't exist in the Buddha's time, we must apply wisdom and investigation, not blind prohibition.

### **Origin of the "Music is Bad" Idea**
*   The concern stems from a misapplication of the monastic rule (*Pātimokkha*) against attending public performances (*"nacca gīta vādita visūkadassana"*).
*   This rule was specifically about monks **going to shows** (often sexually charged performances) as spectators, which was seen as undignified and a potential slave to sensual pleasure. It was **not a condemnation of sound or music itself**.
*   The rule also addressed a specific historical context: in the past, to hear music, you *had* to go to a live performance. Today, technology allows private listening, changing the context entirely.

### **The Role of Wisdom and Intention**
*   **Music is Neutral:** Music itself isn't inherently good or bad. Its value depends on how we use it and how it affects our mind.
*   **Investigate the Effect:** The key is to observe *how different music makes you feel*. Does it agitate, soothe, inspire, or sexualize? Become the "boss" of your reaction.
*   **Choose Wisely:** Just as we choose healthy food, we can choose music that supports wholesome mental states (e.g., calming, uplifting, or harmonious music) and avoid music that promotes unwholesome states (e.g., aggressive or addictive music).

### **Music as a Potential Dhamma Tool**
*   Music can have **Dhammic value**. It can teach harmony, cooperation (like an orchestra), and joy (*muditā*). It can be used for investigation, observing how sensory input affects the mind.
*   Listening can be done with a "Dhamma eye," analyzing the intention behind the music and our psychological response to it.

### **Addressing the Student's Concern**
The student (Marcus) shares that he used music/entertainment as an **escape or distraction** from unpleasant feelings, creating a dependency. Dhammarato reframes this:
*   The problem isn't the music, but the **mind's habit of dependency and avoidance**.
*   The solution is to investigate that feeling of "missing" or "needing" stimulation. The goal is to reach a point where you can enjoy music **without being attached or dependent** on it.
*   The practice is to **cultivate internal stability** so that your mental state is not controlled by external inputs.

### **Key Takeaways & Practical Advice**
1.  **Don't Make Rules, Make Investigations:** Replace the question "Is music allowed?" with "How does this music affect my mind?"
2.  **You Are in Charge:** Your mind creates your feeling state. Music is a condition, not a controller. Practice choosing your response.
3.  **Context Matters:** Mindful, private listening is fundamentally different from a monk seeking out sensual public spectacles.
4.  **Use Wisdom:** Apply the same "wise reflection" used for food (eating for nourishment, not pleasure) to music: listen for support, not for feeding craving.
5.  **The Real Practice:** The ultimate goal is freedom from dependency. Whether you listen or not, the work is to understand and master your own mind.

In essence, the talk shifts the focus from external prohibition to internal wisdom. The path is about developing discernment and freedom, not about creating a new set of restrictive rules for modern life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explore the question of whether listening to music is compatible with spiritual practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Automobile as a "Boat," not a "Horse":** Speaker B uses this to challenge rigid, literal interpretations of ancient rules. The Buddha had rules against riding animals (like horses) but allowed boats. A car is more like a modern "boat" (a permissible tool) than a "horse" (an animal that could be abused), so the spirit of the rule, not its ancient form, should guide us.
2.  **Music as Being "In Tune" vs. "Noise":** This is a central metaphor. Good music is "in tune and in rhythm," which parallels the Dharma goal of getting "in tune with nature, to get in tune with reality, to become one with it, to harmonize." "Noise," in contrast, is disharmonious and what we dislike. Thus, music can have Dharma value.
3.  **Politics as a "Show" / Music as "Actors on a Stage":** Speaker B compares politics to a performance designed to manipulate feelings. The wise approach is to be "in the world but not of it"—you can hear it but not buy into it. The same applies to music: you can appreciate it as a performance without being enslaved by it.
4.  **The World as a "Dance" or "Play" (Sila):** Speaker B contrasts the human tendency to see life as a rigid "march" with the reality that the natural world operates in a harmonious "waltz" or "dance." Music can help us reconnect with that natural, harmonious flow.
5.  **Music as "Food for the Mind":** The discussion about eating with wise reflection is used as an analogy. Just as one should eat food with mindfulness—for nourishment, not indulgence—one can listen to music with the same wise reflection: paying attention to its effect and purpose, not just consuming it mindlessly.
6.  **"Salving the Savage Beast":** Speaker B references the old phrase "music salves the savage beast" to suggest that music can be a tool for soothing and calming the mind, implying a positive, therapeutic use.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Pope at the Opera:** Speaker B recounts a YouTube video showing the Pope attending an opera as a member of the audience. He argues the Buddha's rule was against monks being *spectators* at sensual public performances, not against music itself. A truly elevated figure (like the Buddha or a "real Pope") would be the *center* of attention on stage, not a "gawker." This story reframes the rule from being *anti-music* to being *anti-passive, sensual spectatorship*.
2.  **Brian and Achan Po Listen to Beethoven:** A monk named Brian had the lifelong monk Achan Po listen to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (specifically the "Ode to Joy"). Afterward, Achan Po declared it "wholesome" and not what the Buddha prohibited. This story directly challenges the notion that all music is forbidden, showing that even an esteemed monk found profound spiritual value in classical music.
3.  **The Flute and the Forest (Wat Soan Mu):** Speaker B references a drawing with the caption: "the music of the flute returns to the forest." The story is: bamboo is taken from the forest to make a flute, and its music is then returned to the forest. This illustrates a cycle of natural harmony and suggests music is part of nature's cycle, not separate from it.
4.  **Personal History with "Rhapsody in Blue":** Speaker B shares a personal story of recognizing mistakes in a performance of *Rhapsody in Blue* but realizing the joy and connection of the performer were more important than technical perfection. This illustrates the difference between a sterile "performance" and truly "playing" music with heart—a metaphor for engaged vs. detached practice.
5.  **The Evolution of Music Technology:** Speaker B tells a brief history from live-only performances, to his father's early tape recorder, to modern headphones and streaming. The point is that the Buddha's context was *live public performances*, which is fundamentally different from today's private, recorded music. The rule addressed a specific social context, not the intrinsic quality of sound.
6.  **Giving Up the Guitar:** Speaker B shares his personal story of giving away his guitar when he became a monk, only to have his appreciation for music's beauty "ripen" decades later. This story warns against making rigid, lifelong rules based on a stage of practice, advocating instead for ongoing investigation and wisdom.

### **Overall Narrative Metaphor:**
The entire discussion uses the metaphor of **navigation**. The Dharma is not a set of rigid **rules** (maps to follow blindly) but a call for **investigation and wisdom** (learning to steer your own ship). The stories and examples are like landmarks showing how to navigate the specific terrain of modern life with ancient principles.
