### Transcript


**Speaker A:** you're happy. Try to find that happiness so it's more subtle, more like more pure in a way.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, yeah, I really relate to that a lot, like, because there are some moments, but it's so tricky. It's so tricky because there are moments where I'll be like, I'm able to sort of relax, and I guess the Piti, like the feeling like a winner and stuff, will and like the bodily euphoria will decrease and I can kind of just relax a bit into it. But then there'll be a time after that where like it's like I just get like angry at myself or something, like some anger comes up and I just go and then I go into anger, but I'm enjoying the anger because anger, like we talked about before, it's like so tricky because it makes you, it like sucks you in, it makes you like really in, like anger is like kind of pleasant in a way. Because when you're angry, you don't want to stop being angry. And then I'll get really angry, and then that'll turn into like the happiness. And kind of, yeah, but thank you though. Thank you. Yeah, I, I, that's sort of what I've intuited as well. It's like just try to relax, just relax and stuff, instead of like feeling like— I think, I think a lot of it is just like trying to relax. That's kind of what I got from what you just said.

**Speaker C:** At least. Yeah, like kind of coming— oh, sorry. Yeah, like coming back even to the basics, like even like the first four, like sort of aspects of Anapanasati and being more just focused on like the long in-breath and out-breath and then like the paying attention to the bodily sensations and then relaxing those. And that even can go because I was practicing this a bit like with my morning sit. I was like feeling like, okay, I kind of want to go more into relaxation. And, and not want, you know what I mean? But just like, that's kind of where I'm going to take this. And so it was more just that very, you know what I mean, just sort of basic things and just relaxing the sensations, you know what I mean? And just going more into that rather than like a really far out there like investigation, but just, yeah, going into like, okay, this is just nice and, you know, relaxing. Yeah. And just being satisfied too with that, right? Like, it's just Yeah, that's really the satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like being able to be satisfied without being this like super energetic person, being able to be satisfied with just like slowing things down.

**Speaker D:** In the Seven Factors of Awakening, tranquility comes after Piti. So that's the order, you know. So just to like a reminder, it's like investigate— it's mindfulness, investigation of states, energy and Piti. And this is where you're at, you know. And then you get to Tranquility, and then Samadhi and Concentration. Although Samadhi really is gathering up all the other factors together, so kind of Samadhi could come last. But in the order, it's— sorry, Equanimity is the the final one, Samadhi, equanimity. And, um, yeah, so it's tranquility is a natural result of the practice, you know. It's, it should naturally arise, uh, when you get, when you get tired of the Piti, basically. Um, and then you just allow that.

**Speaker B:** Do you think that will happen on its own eventually? Like, I'll eventually just get tired of it? Because it feels like itself, it's like it's once this is like a weird way to say it, but it's like it's self-generating. Like, I'll relax, it's addictive, and then I'll relax and I'll feel kind of sad because I lost like the Piti, and then like I'll feel— I won't let myself feel sad and I'll like become angry again, and then I'll spike that back into like feeling like I'm like really all-powerful being, and like, well, I can cancel any negativity I want, I can do whatever I want now, I got the Dhamma. And I go back to Piti. And then when I'm in Piti, it's like, yeah, yeah. I'm also like more impulsive as well. I have less self-control. I'm talking, interrupting people, not caring what people think of me, which I honestly, I don't care. I'd rather be socially anxious than not care what people think of me. I feel like that's healthier and it's healthier for others because I feel like I just, in some of my relationships, like with my boyfriend, like I've just been like an asshole, you know, like just like ignoring his messages and stuff. And just, it's not good. It's not good to be that detached, I think. It's like, yeah, I don't know. But I think I really like what you said.

**Speaker D:** Okay, but you're in a hindrance right now of like judging, you know, like, because you're just sitting there like, oh, it's not good, I want the change, you know, and like It's okay, like it's just what it is. We're not perfect, we're humans, right? And like just accepting, like fully accepting like ourselves and like being okay with being imperfect, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, right now, but we always aim to like to remove the defilements. That's the goal of practice, not like pessimistic, okay, we're imperfect, we're going to be imperfect forever. No. We're imperfect, but we aim high. And something that I want to point out, Joe, is you said like tranquility will arise naturally. And we got to understand something, that nothing really arises naturally. That's not how things work. It arises because we want it to arise. Like there is the desire for it to arise. Like deep inside in the mind, like deep inside, we want these things to happen. So they happen, that's why. It doesn't arise naturally and tranquility also. It doesn't arise naturally.

**Speaker B:** I think of it like deep down I really do want to be like equanimous and peaceful and conduct myself in a manner that's correct.

**Speaker A:** So you should create the environment that allows these things to happen. And do some effort for that. You can relax your body. In everyday practice, you don't engage in conflicts. You do good stuff. You help others do merit, be generous, helping others, that kind of stuff. That makes your mind tranquil. It helps to practice a lot. There's the effort that we put in. And in meditation, in tranquility, tranquillity, you can make your body tranquil, and if you're sensitive to your mind, you make it tranquil. That's also, you do it, it doesn't arise naturally. Don't sit and wait, oh, where is tranquillity, when is it going to arise? No, effort.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's what you said actually, be sensitive, when you're sensitive to your mind, I noticed in myself that I'm actually not that sensitive. To mind. I'm kind of— because I'm so focused on just doing the technique and sustaining my happiness and not falling into like really bad hindrances where like I feel like I'm like a bit like I'm like really, really feeling some negative emotions and stuff. Like, but being able to like have like still tap into like the same, like being sensitive to myself and stuff and like what I'm feeling, even You know, like, I feel like I go to, like, block my emotions, or I'd be too sensitive. It's like, I want to be here, like, not feeling the hindrances, but also when the mind is sensitive, like, that's kind of like, that's gonna like sort

**Speaker D:** of

**Speaker B:** reveal that I do really want the tranquility, and then I'll like go towards it. That's kind of like what I've concluded.

**Speaker D:** But the tranquility is like is like super mundane, you know. So the Anicca and the Equanimity are both like super mundane. So it's like you're wanting emotions to have this stability or this constancy, but you're looking at things that are not like of the same nature of what you're looking at. So that's what I'm hearing. And I just know because I've been there too, like too focused on the emotions and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, emotions is like, if it's an egg, The emotions is the shell, it's outside, it's like the drawing, it's not the essence of it. The essence is the clinging. Emotions are created by, it's fabricated. And if you stay on the emotions, you don't go deep into your meditation, it stays on the surface. If you want to go deep, where is the clinging? You should ask yourself, where is the clinging? Where am I attached? Where my mind wants to go, what my mind likes, what does it like, what does it dislike. Maybe you had an argument in the day and like in the back of your mind you're still thinking about it. Maybe you have homework, you're stressed over exams and in the back of your mind you're not really relaxed and you're thinking about it. That's an attachment, right? Maybe like you have something that you want to do, that's the attachment, that You really, that creates the emotion. Like, what does it create the emotion? You should ask yourself that.

**Speaker B:** So it's not just like I'm creating emotions myself.

**Speaker A:** That's the real deal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. You think it's like I'm kind of like these things that I'm unaware of are creating emotions. I'm ignoring it. And then I think it's me creating the emotion. But really it's like these attachments, but I'm just like, I'm just not aware that it's actually those attachments, like kind of like a psychotherapy-ish thing. Do you know what I'm trying to ask? Like, because I feel like it's me creating like these emotions, like I, I choose to feel happy.

**Speaker D:** I would answer, but I want to hear Muhammad's answer because he feels like an awesome Dharma teaching right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he's giving me good advice so far.

**Speaker A:** I honestly could not catch with you because you really speak Very fast.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So the question is like, I feel like I'm responsible for creating the emotions. Yes, of course you think like I'm actually like attached to something, but I don't know I'm attached to it, and then that attachment is creating the emotion, and it's not just like me making it because I want to feel good,

**Speaker A:** or

**Speaker B:** It's kind of confusing, I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, the first part is true. We all create our emotions. We created ourselves, whether we are aware of it or not. And we should bring light to how we create these things so we can create good emotions, create good emotions and get rid of bad emotions. Okay, like, I don't know what's in your mind, like what's your life and these things. But like some general guidelines, for example, if you're feeling guilty, you did something bad and you're feeling guilty about it, so you're going to think that that bad deed that you did in the past is going to arise and it's going to make you unhappy. That's an attachment. You should forgive yourself, say, okay, it's in the past, and you should accept also, that's a very important part, you should accept the consequences of what you did. You did something bad, okay, you should be okay with whatever consequences is possibly going to happen in the future. And that thing is going to go away. When you do it right, it's going to go away. And different attachments, you deal with them in different ways. And you should see what is it in your life that is creating the emotion. What's the problem in your life?

**Speaker B:** That's what I'm trying to do. I think I'm just— And you should deal with it. That's what I was ignoring. I'm gonna do it anyway. I'm gonna answer my own question and just see for myself, like, what's actually, like, creating all this stuff. Start, like, linking up the cause and effects and stuff.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, that's true. That's truly looking into karma, you know, is that, like, when the conditions— well, it's— but it's not— I'm not saying karma, like, you know, but, but that's what it means is cause and effect, right? Is that— yeah, I didn't think about the conditions. When the conditions arise, I never really

**Speaker B:** think about karma at all.

**Speaker D:** Like, something manifests. Ignore that. When you have the conditions for sadness, then it arises, you know. And the whole of dependent origination that Muhammad is getting at is trying to break this chain and look at it and see it, you know.

**Speaker A:** What it is?

**Speaker B:** I know Daniel Ingram talks about this in Mastering Proximity Buddha, even though I don't experience it the way he describes it, because I think he talks about like extreme versions of it. But it's kind of like a cycle of I get really happy for a couple of weeks and then I go back to like, like sad and afraid.

**Speaker D:** But you're just in storytelling mode right now and you're not in touch with like the present, you know. Because like, we all do this to ourselves, is that we create this story and this idea and this like permanent sort of internal dialogue of like trying to inherently make something permanent that is like a constantly shifting target.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh dude, this is so complicated, man. Like, I relate to what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** Like, I know you're saying when you, when you are happy, you say you're happy for a while, then you get sad. When you're happy, are you attached to that happiness, that state of happiness?

**Speaker B:** No, it feels natural. But I actually, actually, no, no, no, no, no. I only notice I'm attached to it after I come out of it. But when I'm in it, I don't—

**Speaker A:** But you were attached to it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When I'm in it, I don't feel like it.

**Speaker B:** And I've been trying to notice this. Like when I'm in it, I'm like, I'm not attached to anything right now. I'm chilling. But then when I'm out of it, it feels like I'm attached to something. Like I'm somehow resisting something. But when I'm in it, I don't

**Speaker D:** actually feel like I'm attached to something. You have to look deeper though, because it's like this. It's like when you're at the bar and you see everybody and they're all laughing and smiling, if you really look a little bit deeper underneath the surface, there's definitely clinging underneath there. Even if you're in the moment, Yeah,

**Speaker B:** I feel like the perfect metaphor is like those, you know, those like rap music videos where the rappers are all like, you know, we shot your gang, we are the best gang, everything's lit in our gang, your gang sucks. You know those like rap songs and they're all like super happy and like confident? That's like exactly kind of like how I feel.

**Speaker D:** Well, we all feel that, we all get lost.

**Speaker B:** But when I'm out of that state, it feels like I'm— when I was in that state, like that wasn't like the true like happiness. Even though like I'm sad now, this is like more relaxed, even though I'm like sad, but then I get angry again. I'm actually realizing this as you're explaining it, by the way, guys. So this like, even though I'm not like technically like replying to what you're saying, you're helping me understand.

**Speaker D:** So the best tip that I would have is the next time that you're in that state, when it just happens to arise, is just look at the impermanence of that state, you know, of like, because you can be in that state, and you can— it's the same of like when a lot of times when like we're giving advice on like, okay, invite in your darkness, uh, and you can maintain sort of equanimity with it and, uh, and be okay with the darkness being present within you. The same can be true of like an overly exuberant state where, you know, naturally you're in a party situation and you just feel good, right? That's just how it is. You're in this sort of like flow state or whatever. But if you actually like examine that too, there's going to be a subtle part of yourself that is going to say, I want this to continue permanently, you know.

**Speaker B:** But then I know the teaching, but then I recall the teaching and I say, oh, that's an attachment. And because I'm already so happy, it's so easy for me to just let it go. And then I don't want it. Or I just don't feel that way. I don't know,

**Speaker D:** that's confusing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, the thing that's kind

**Speaker B:** of interesting— Sorry for like arguing with what you're saying. I'm just trying to like get to an understanding, I guess. It's kind of how I learn.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But anyway, go on.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, yeah, I was going to say, like, even with the aha, I see you, Mara, right? Or ex-hindrance, right? You're kind of getting into a thing of the impermanence because it's like shifting, right? Already the thought shifted. But also, I mean, because these are all connected, the Anatta, like the understanding of non-self. I am not that hindrance. I'm not that thought. That thought is something which has arisen within, like, you know, experience, enjoying the show, right? It has arisen. It will pass away. And I've already spotted it. It's glad now, right? And so I don't think— I think you don't have to go super deep when you're just like, okay, you know what, I don't have to worry about that.

**Speaker B:** But this is the time. As soon as I do that, I'm glad now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, exactly. I'm glad now.

**Speaker B:** Nothing matters. I don't have to care about like if PJ likes me. And then like, I just like—

**Speaker D:** well,

**Speaker C:** yeah, no, you don't have to care. You don't have to care if I like you. Like, that's just it. That doesn't— yeah, but I don't have to like you. Now you can— yeah, I mean, Well, like, you don't have to care, you know, necessarily what I think about you, but I think, yeah, definitely there is a thing where you can still be careful. You can still be courteous. You can still— but you can do—

**Speaker B:** yeah, it's like one or the other. It's like, yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you can do that from a place of like, it's okay, like, you know what I mean? And I might mess up here or there or whatever, but it's okay, you know what? Because we're coming back to be here now. We're coming back to the breath. And because again, you were talking about like, you know, perhaps difficulties like relaxing or like sleeping or what have you at times, right? Or perhaps being like on more of the Piti end. And also to Joe, I must admit that was really good advice as well, or just a really good point, right? Because this is the thing too, it's not just for like Robert, it's for all of us. It's just, hey, this is good reminders, right? This is good stuff, you know, just to remember. And so The idea that you don't have to fight the pity when it comes up, right? And it depends on how— again, being like, oh, pity is just that sensation. And it's like, not like— that's the interesting thing with Dhammarato. I believe he pointed out, well, it's not just the sensation, it like, you know, bodily sensations of it, right? Like, it's not just that, right? It's kind of the attitude, right? But when those sensations come up, you can just notice them. But then I think there can still be kind of an intent, a will to relax it a bit, but not through fighting it.

**Speaker B:** Just like, yeah, well, listen to what you were saying about not fighting with the Piti. I sort of was practicing, I was practicing the technique, and specifically I wasn't just trying to always gladden the mind, so I was going back in between like the two sort of states, because there's like these two sort of states that I get into where one is like— and what I sort of came into, an insight, maybe this can help you guys help me out here, and I appreciate that a lot, thank you very, very much. Taking the time out of your day to answer my really sort of bizarre side effects of practice problem thing. But it was kind of like, I'm glad in the mind, and it's sort of like I lose like my humanity a little bit. Like, and by that I just mean like caring about things.

**Speaker D:** It's like,

**Speaker B:** like, I'm just cool, I'm just chilling. And then

**Speaker D:** Well, you start— okay, so it feels perfect.

**Speaker B:** It feels like perfection, you know what I mean? Like, I'm perfectly happy. No hint. Like, I don't sense that I'm subtly unconsciously resisting something when I bring that up.

**Speaker A:** Something that we should— the only time

**Speaker B:** I feel like that is when I, like, let it go, either by forgetting, or just now when I was sort of trying to consciously let it go and consciously start caring what you guys think of me, which was kind of like my cue to, like, reintroduce Hindu texts.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Arahant, something that should be clear. The notion of happiness, we speak about happiness, we've spoken about it for a while, but what is happiness? What's the Buddhist perspective about happiness? The true happiness, underline the true, the true happiness is peace. And that's it. No other happiness. Other than peace. I think it's a line in the suttas. There is no other happiness than peace. So I don't know if you read the book of Buddhadasa, Hunger and— is it Happiness and Hunger?

**Speaker B:** I skimmed it. I skimmed all of them. I never really went deep with the text. I just skimmed them all because I wanted to get an overview really quickly.

**Speaker A:** That's a very good book and it speaks about that happiness. What is it, the happiness that the Buddha speaks about? Is it the happiness, I don't know, getting drunk or I don't know. It's happiness, people who do it, they say they're happy, right? They say they're happy. Is it the happiness that the practice does? No, it's not. The true happiness is peace, the satisfaction that you are already satisfied. The absence of craving is the third noble truth, the cessation of suffering, the cessation of Dukkha, Nirodha. The absence of the clinging. There's no clinging, you're satisfied. Like you're thirsty and then you're not thirsty anymore. That's it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but like let's say like

**Speaker A:** I

**Speaker B:** have like an urge to hit my vape and that's like wrong because it's like nicotine, it's addictive and I need to quit eventually. But like, I can resist that urge, and then that creates dukkha, or I can just give into it, and technically there's like nothing wrong with giving into it because I'm just feeling happy. And then it's like, I'm sort of like, I don't really have much like self-control, but I don't care, and I'm still perfectly happy. So like, which is it? Like dukkha, but I have to overcome these like things, or just like be happy and not care about these things? Like, which do I pick?

**Speaker D:** It's still the mundane. As long as you have the appearance of a choice, it's still the mundane. It's when it literally doesn't matter and when it's— Yeah, but when it literally

**Speaker B:** doesn't matter, I do all the wrong shit and I run my mouth.

**Speaker D:** No, but it changes because there's a

**Speaker A:** point where you see— You don't give a shit, but are you satisfied? You can don't give a shit, but you're not satisfied and being miserable. You don't give a shit, right? It doesn't matter whether you give a shit or not.

**Speaker D:** But there's nothing— Yeah, there's nothing. Yeah, there's nothing to give a shit about. That's the key at the bottom of it. There isn't anything. It's just like, it's empty at the bottom of it. We create our own meaning.

**Speaker B:** Then why do I care about overcoming like the subtle desire to hit my vape?

**Speaker D:** Well, that's how you— I can stop

**Speaker B:** caring about it and hit it.

**Speaker D:** Things like that, like mundane things, like they just sort of, you know, like Yeah, I mean, it's difficult because you have to put effort forward in the correct wholesome direction, but you can't do it like the Catholic Church, basically. And yeah, it just doesn't really work.

**Speaker B:** I don't even know how to be an Anicca without suffering, man. That's, I think, what I was realizing. Like, it was funny because I feel like I kept saying this because I was saying to DJ that I'd like figured it out, but when I was saying that, that was after a week of being in this jargon, like, I'm the king of the world state. So

**Speaker D:** I was like the leader. There's nothing to be motivated for. That's, that's the key. It's like, there's nothing to be motivated for. It doesn't matter. Like, it's, it's all pointless, you know. You have to get to the point where you like realize that though, and that you're creating like your own meaning, uh, and like that's the point, you know. But you're gonna get to the point, I think, uh, at least I did, where like everything was very clearly pointless and meaningless, you know. And I was like, holy shit, how freeing that I can create my own meaning, uh, you know. And, uh, yeah, it's— I don't know, it's, it's different.

**Speaker B:** But it's definitely— I want to create my own meaning if it's— if it's— yeah, why would I want to?

**Speaker A:** Unless I induce a perfect— everything doesn't have really meaning that it's true. Like, really, there's no meaning. Like You create the meaning. So every meaning that you think is important, there's an attachment in that meaning. There is suffering in that attachment. So what you want to do, that meaning does not really matter. So there's really no meaning and you're kind of free. You don't really have to add meanings. The meanings that we put is in terms of the practice. We give meaning to virtue and to renunciation and generosity. Because it leads to the goal. But meanings in themselves, really there's no meaning. I don't know if you can really put it into practice or not. Like, I don't know. But yeah, it's true. It's kind of liberating. I don't know if you try it, maybe it can help.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and what Dhammarato says about this is, I've heard him often say that, like, just like don't make too many, like, I think when I was discussing this with him a little bit, and he was like, you know, just, just don't create too, too much, you know. Like, it's— you're, you're just okay right now, you know. Like, you don't have to, you don't have to like sit here and like, yeah, come up with all these strategies. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** I think that's a good, a good thing to bring up because it's like You know, the smallest amount of satisfaction is good enough, right? It doesn't have to be like— that's the problem.

**Speaker B:** That's the problem is it's good enough. I feel good enough. I feel good enough not like quitting nicotine and not like reaching tranquility. Like, I feel— but there's no problem.

**Speaker D:** There's no problem.

**Speaker B:** But then like,

**Speaker D:** but you have to just keep telling yourself that, you know, that like I think a lot of

**Speaker B:** it is wanting to do things. It's wanting like people to like me, and it's wanting to take right speech, and it's wanting to take right action and right livelihood.

**Speaker D:** And they all come, all of them, and all of those things, they come out of right view. And coming, and to get right view is to understand the Four Noble Truths. So all of those come like by looking at the Four Noble Truths, you know. So you can't have right speech if you haven't like fully looked into it. And like, you know, that's just part of it. You know, it's a big problem that a lot of people, they take up Sila and they like try to fix their Sila till it's like perfect. And they're a person that like they want everybody to like them and they want to become passionate and they want to be all these things. But then like you haven't got the right view, you know, and the Buddha says right view comes first. You know, that's, that's just how it is, you know. And, and it's a result of wisdom, you know.

**Speaker B:** And by right view, you mean not being Anicca?

**Speaker D:** Understanding the Four Noble Truths.

**Speaker B:** Understanding. So that there's suffering. So suffering is going to come up again in the future, right? There's a way out of dissatisfaction.

**Speaker D:** There's dissatisfaction. Every way out of dissatisfaction is caused by clinging.

**Speaker B:** By clinging. And there's a way out of this.

**Speaker A:** The Dukkha is the tension. I don't have any better word to say it. It's the tension. That's the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** But what if I feel tension and I'm not suffering the tension? And what if I feel tense but I still feel fine? Like, I still feel fine even if I'm tense. Like, because I can say good enough. It's good enough that I'm tense. And then I'm fine. But I still feel tense. And I'm still restless. But I'm not resisting the restlessness.

**Speaker A:** And I'm still— What do you mean by fine? Are you enjoying it? Yeah. That's Dukkha. You should be sensitive to it. And the right view tells you that you don't have to. You're like taking happiness from it. You don't have to. You don't have to really. You don't have to enjoy it. You can be happy without it. You can be like, you enjoy it to get satisfied. You enjoy the tension to get satisfied. But you can be satisfied without enjoying the tension. I don't know if you get it. You understand it. You can be satisfied without like— Yes,

**Speaker B:** yes, yes, yes, yes. No, I understand what you're saying. I think I understand what you're saying. So with the the vape example, I want to take a hit, I stop myself. And even though I know that I can be an addict and still be happy, I'm actually like a level up. So I'm like more like, like, like I'm a level up. So even though I know I can, I choose not to, which induces suffering. And then I enjoy that suffering as well. So I'm still doing the right thing. But I'm also like enjoying.

**Speaker D:** You're still phrasing it in terms of right and wrong though. I think that's kind of— I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, man, it's just, it's just tricky because my brain has this simple thing now from doing this technique for so long where as soon as I feel any form of suffering, I just Nirodha it.

**Speaker D:** I don't care.

**Speaker B:** So I'll just be like, nope, it's out of here, and then I'm chilling. But then like, I don't care about— I don't know, man. That's why it's confusing. Like, I know I'm doing a lot of like thinking in black and white and stuff, but I don't know how not to think. It's like, well, I mean, some said when I— this, like, Kishon said, like, this is one of the really big turnaround moments that for me as well was like, Kishon said, like, I learned that putting my hand in this fire, like, sucks, so I took it out. And then I was like, oh yeah, I'm purposely causing myself to suffer, so I stopped doing that. But the, like, you know what I mean? It's like, I It's, it's, it's— I'm thinking maybe I should— I'm thinking actually lately, like, maybe I should do like a sort of like a home retreat or something where I just like cut off all my technology and I like lock myself in my room and I just have like no like stimulus to go to. Maybe that'll just heal it.

**Speaker D:** Just not having it. Come visit me at my farm. I can— I can't, Panna. It's a lot more pleasant.

**Speaker B:** Yours takes like 10 months to process. I mean, it's in process, so I could in 10 months, but— Okay, well,

**Speaker D:** it's a lot more pleasant than like sitting in your room and we can do that, we'll take the technology away thing.

**Speaker A:** Well,

**Speaker C:** I was gonna say though, I don't think it necessarily like has to be though, right? Like, I mean, to a certain degree, right? Because I mean, there it's like, okay, like if we go to this, it's gonna be, you know, better, right? And so it's just like, I don't know, sometimes it's just like, take that deep breath, just enjoy and be satisfied with that, you know, here and now. And I think, yeah, I think through that satisfaction though, you do kind of like more, yeah, like the right actions and all that.

**Speaker B:** You kind of get this arrogance, like, I can be satisfied anyway, so I don't have to care about things.

**Speaker C:** Well, but then I think the thing's also like, you know, I can be satisfied anyway. So like, why, why not do this thing if it seems beneficial, right? Like, why not? If it seems beneficial, I might as well do it because I can be satisfied doing it. It's like, you know, like earlier this week when there was a massive snowstorm or whatever, and it's like, oh, okay, now I got to, you know, go out and shovel the driveway.

**Speaker B:** You put it up to Anicca. It's like, why not do it if I can satisfy anyway? And so I start doing the right thing, but then like I'm not feeling like really like sad or afraid, but I have like— and I feel still like kind of good overall, but it's not like proper like Jhana or anything because I'm super angry. That's what I mean, where it's like— that's exactly what I mean. You just said exactly what I mean, even though I didn't understand how to explain it. It's like I just feel angry. It's like do the right thing, but I have to feel this like anger and tension. And it's like I know like I don't have to do this to feel satisfied. But I should still do it, and therefore I'll try and make myself feel satisfied while I'm still doing it. And then it's like I'm all like angry and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, about anger, sometimes it comes out of habit, you know. Your habit is to get angry, so it's kind of tendency to get angry, but it's just a tendency. It arises, but you continue it, and you have the choice when it arises to say no, stop there.

**Speaker B:** That's it, man, that's it.

**Speaker A:** It's like, it arises, but you cling to it and you enjoy it. That's it. So you should notice when that, like, a pic or that stick of anger, when it arises, you see it, it's just a habit. It's my mind doing it by itself. So this is— At that moment you choose, no, I'm not going to do it because it's stupid. And you should reflect, also on the situation of that anger. Like, reflect on the situation, what are going to be the consequences. Imagine if someone could see you and you're getting angry, maybe you're ashamed of yourself getting angry. Do these types of reflections. And when you see it and you're mindful when that anger arises, you catch yourself before you actually cling to it.

**Speaker B:** I think what I'm getting from what you said is that I need to be more nuanced in my approach because my approach before was always suffering, no suffering, suffering, no suffering. Whereas now I think I should be able to use like the letting go muscle that I built from letting go of suffering to actually let go of like the emotions. Like on the whole, I think this might have been my spiritual bypassing because I thought it was something wrong.

**Speaker D:** Do you remember what I was saying

**Speaker B:** to Alex all the time? I was saying like, oh yeah, that's really good progress how you're able to feel your negative emotions but like not suffer them and stuff. That's really good. Because that's what I was going through at the same time as he was going through it. And I thought that was progress. But now I think I need to like progress more to actually be able to— like, if I'm so good at letting go and I think I'm this big man in my head, I should be able to let go of that and let go of the anger emotion as a whole and let go of the sadness as a whole. Hey, Robert, I'd be like more nuanced to be able to let things go.

**Speaker D:** I think like this sort of like strategizing and the part of you that that wants to come up with like the final solution. Like, that's, that's what you got to look at, you know, because like our minds like also cling to that. And it's like, okay, I'm just trying

**Speaker B:** to think about that. It's not a final solution. I never said it was a final solution. I don't believe in any of that.

**Speaker D:** I know, I know, no, I know you do. I know you don't, but, but you're gonna get my head, but maybe you're clinging to it still, you know, because like That's just human nature. It's like, we're like, okay, I have this new thing and yeah, yeah, I'm

**Speaker B:** going to develop a new, more advanced approach.

**Speaker D:** And then this is going to be it.

**Speaker B:** It's more like multifaceted.

**Speaker D:** It's just, it just needs to come. You just need to come back to the present moment and come back to the breath and just enjoy, you know. That's all that it is. And find freedom and ease and comfort.

**Speaker B:** That's what, that's why I'm going to do a retreat now. I'm going to do like a not a retreat retreat, but like a just like sort of like a home retreat.

**Speaker D:** What about right now?

**Speaker B:** Just force myself to just learn to enjoy just breathing.

**Speaker D:** But what about, what about right now? I mean, like, we're all together. I mean, it's not— it again, like, we, we tend to cling to this retreat idea, and that's going to be the, the thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's another like solution, right? It's like idol worship.

**Speaker A:** I've done this a lot.

**Speaker B:** It's like I'm worshiping the idol of, oh yeah, if I just do a 10-day retreat my brain will automatically like stop wanting like stuff.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** And I don't need the treats. I never did any retreat.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you don't. Yeah. And, and it's just, it's just another thing that you can cling to because then all of a sudden you're going to do a retreat and then you're going to tell everybody about your retreat and then you'll be thinking about the next one and you'll be thinking about the retreat for the next— that's exactly

**Speaker B:** what my brain was doing. I was like, oh yeah,

**Speaker D:** right now is the time to be on the retreat, you know, that it's always going like 24 hours a day whenever we wake up to it, you know, that it's always available to us.

**Speaker B:** And I love that idea, man. That's so empowering.

**Speaker D:** It's like, but it's sort of— especially if you're into like Ingram and that, like, the big— like, one of the big problems with his approach is it's very like retreat-oriented, and it's like time on retreat versus time off retreat. And integrating it into your entire life and remembering over and over again that it's always available to us. And there's not this like special thing. If you go on a retreat, there's not going to be any like special teaching that you're going to get. And like, sometimes the conditions, as you heard from Dan, he's like, the conditions were better for me to practice in a hotel in Thailand than they were at the retreat center. You know, like, that's the actual reality. That's— this actually happens. I've had a retreat that I left you know, like this is the actual reality of how it actually is, you know, but our minds cling to it as another idea. And it's another attachment point.

**Speaker B:** I think I've kind of grasped a little bit of what's happening with what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** It is.

**Speaker B:** It's like, I have these really big let go moments where I make these huge jumps in progress because I let go of this huge attachment that was running my life. Like productivity is one that I let go of recently. Like I just stopped caring about doing work and stuff like other than my day job. And even though that like makes like no money, but like I just let go of it. And then my automatic tendency is just to like do whatever I want and stuff. And I don't create a problem with that. Like I know I'm saying it like it's a problem. I'm not actually like suffering over it like in my day-to-day life because I just do it and I don't care because I'm doing the good enough technique.

**Speaker D:** Right?

**Speaker B:** But it's like, it's like, what's the next one? What's the next attachment that I haven't dropped, you know? Like, what's the next— like, yeah, what's

**Speaker D:** the next— well, you can't prepare for the future either.

**Speaker B:** I'm not trying to have the future.

**Speaker D:** I'm trying— I know, but that's— but you can't jump, you can't jump into the future. You only have— but you only have right now, you know? And like, you can just see what's happening with your mind right now and see the patterns it's about. But the helpful thing is, is the reason I know that you're attached to this is because I get the same thoughts, because our minds all work the same, like they have the same function. And so when we're talking to each other, we're giving each other advice, but it's like we're talking to ourselves, you know. I'm just laughing when Alex is talking because he's saying out loud what we all have thought at one time or another. Because he's just like, he's able to just say everything that comes into his mind that we've all had a thought at one time or another. Because our minds— yeah, I was like laughing.

**Speaker B:** He was like, that's like exactly what it's like for me. And I had a week where everything was fine.

**Speaker D:** It can change, but it can change though. Like, the key is, is to see that like, like, it can change, you know? And like, we have the choice to wake up to it whenever we want to, you know? That maybe you have like a couple of those thoughts and then you, and then you wake up to it. And like, the time period between waking up to it gets like shorter and shorter.

**Speaker B:** I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that.

**Speaker A:** I like that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, I think that was put like, yeah, excellently, Joe. Like again, yeah, it's like you're kind of familiar because it's like, yeah, that thought came up you know, at one point for me too, like it arose, you know, like that's, that's just the thing. Like, and I know, like, with the Daniel Ingram stuff, right, and that sort of like, oh, you need to kind of get something or whatever, like, can come up. I mean, like, at least if you— because I, like, read Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I've read it too.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. So it's like, oh, okay, like, oh, you need to go on a retreat. I mean, I, I I was always kind of skeptical about the retreat thing, to be honest. But like, not always, but you know, I was like, hmm, you know, like, do you really need it, like, necessarily, right? If we're coming back to here now, it can be beneficial.

**Speaker D:** Like, you need it, you need a period, you need a period of seclusion. And Dhammarato talks about this all the time, is that you need seclusion and you need to be able to create seclusion for yourself, uh, but you don't need a retreat. And a lot of times you can get really, really hindered on your practice if you go to a retreat and it's just the wrong teaching, you know. I mean, there were a lot of like times where I was really locked into the Guenka thinking that was very harmful because some of the thoughts there are sort of like, stay with whatever is present, just be aware of whatever is going on right now, don't try to change reality. And I now see that that is not a helpful teaching and probably not like in line with— actually, it's not in line with what the Buddha taught. But that's how it's taught in retreat centers. And then you go to one of these things and then it's shoved down your throat for 10 days. And then you like spend the next couple of years trying to break out of that. So yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, having that period, yeah, of like seclusion or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Like, again, that wrong Dharma teaches you bad habits to be okay with the suffering, which really is not what the Buddha taught. The Buddha taught there is suffering, there is the end of suffering.

**Speaker B:** See, this is exactly what I was doing. I thought that I was doing the right teaching because I'd hear like all these like enlightened people say that, oh yeah, I still experience negative emotions. But my relationship to it has changed. And I thought, oh well, that's what I'm tapping into. I'm able to experience suffering without suffering. But like, that's actually like another— it's another like trap.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. What did you say, Mohammed?

**Speaker A:** Sorry, enlightened people, like, like, should they— should not get these negative emotions?

**Speaker B:** Or like, Daniel Ingram is a big fraud. I had someone say that, man. I read like an article.

**Speaker A:** That's not the goal of the practice, to be okay with the negative emotion. The goal of the practice, to be beyond these emotions. Like these emotions, there's no reason for them to arise.

**Speaker B:** I like that, man. Let's bring in the high standards.

**Speaker D:** I don't think you have to say that Daniel Ingram is a fraud either. You don't have to go that far because like obviously his book is pretty awesome for like citing so many other books and it's an awesome reference point. It's just to be aware of where his teachings are not in line with the Buddha's teaching discussion. And the easiest way to do that is to stick with like reading the suttas. And just comparing what they actually say to what he's saying, you know.

**Speaker B:** Can you send me all the good suttas? Because there's like hundreds of them now, like I'm not gonna read all that.

**Speaker D:** Right, and so that's the thing.

**Speaker B:** I read a couple yesterday and like half of them weren't even like relevant to my practice. It was just like some random ass story. I was like, what am I doing?

**Speaker C:** Oh, excuse me.

**Speaker D:** I would say, I would ask Dhammarato because he will give you a list of which ones will be relevant for you. Oh, perfect.

**Speaker B:** That's perfect.

**Speaker D:** Because he did that with me and he said, I'll read this one and this one and this one. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Oh, excuse me, it's just, uh, it's time for me to leave, but it has been like an excellent conversation. It's been so much fun. And just, yeah, yeah, thank you so

**Speaker B:** much for the help.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Joe. And yeah, Muhammad. And yes, talking to you again, Robert. It's been, yeah, great. Like, so yeah, thanks so much. And yeah, we hope to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, see you soon.

**Speaker C:** Bye.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, guys. You guys have really, really helped reshape my understanding a lot.

**Speaker D:** Just— and I know that you're sort of beating yourself up because you're like, oh my God, I'm like, I like did the wrong practice because like I have done that too, you know? But like, that's not helpful. It just, you know, like, you know what not to do.

**Speaker B:** Okay, guys, I have a very specific question.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Relate completely to this present moment.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So I'm kind of hungry right now. So I can go down and eat like candy or I can eat like some like fruit. They're both like sweet. Okay. So it's kind of similar. Actually, fuck, that doesn't work because I actually want the fruit more than candy. Never mind. But okay, forget it. Forget it.

**Speaker D:** Forget it.

**Speaker B:** My question is stupid. I want the fruit anyway.

**Speaker D:** Well, one thing that's interesting. Okay. So one thing that's interesting about food specifically at this time of night is to look into whether your body actually needs the food or not. Because from what I understand, it's probably like 10 o'clock at night where you're at, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's 12 o'clock this time.

**Speaker D:** And like, does your body— your body's getting ready to go to sleep. Does it really need to eat right now? That can be kind of interesting. Or is it habit?

**Speaker B:** I'm a Bhikkhuni channel sometimes.

**Speaker D:** I know, but okay, but this is the thing, and I'm the same way, and my mind talks to me the same way. So, but the nighttime snacking thing, it's a lot of times it's just a habit, you know, and like we know like our bodies tend to not really need like food right before going to sleep. That you're not going to wake up hungry. Like that's just, I don't know, my experience with it is like just realizing that it's it's another— it's, it's just another thing there, you know, of like— I, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** I think you do know. I think you just can't explain.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but you can't explain.

**Speaker B:** It's just not going in because I don't know.

**Speaker C:** That's the problem.

**Speaker D:** It's hard to explain because like, okay, so you see the bodily sensations of the, the eating and, you know, and you just eat for like the, the nourishment of it you know, but at this time of the night, you really like— I mean, of course, just eat if you want to. Like, it doesn't really matter. I mean, it's, it's fine, whatever. But I, but I'm just saying from a perspective of like looking, like looking into it is like, what is my body like doing requesting food right now, you know? Like, what are the actual sensations like within me? Um, how much of it is mental and how much of it is actually physical? You know, that's the interesting portion for me because often it's habit energy and it's mental and it's not so much physical, you know. But this is as somebody too who I like, I work outside and like a lot of times I just like forget to eat and I, you know, that's like, so I'm used to periods of like not eating. But actually our bodies are kind of like designed for this because as like hunter-gatherers traditionally, we would have come across a lot of food, eaten a lot, and then had periods where we like didn't eat so much. If you like study like other cultures and things like that, like generally they don't do this sort of like small lots of meals thing, you know. There's a reason that like the big meal of the day was always lunchtime for people, you know. Pretty much universally. This is just kind of like how our body functions. And so yeah, it's just kind of interesting to look at and, you know, be like, yeah, I'm also this like nocturnal sort of thing. But how much of the nocturnal thing is like the fact that I have access to a computer and I have access to light, you know? Because naturally when you're out camping or something like that, I can guarantee you that you're not nocturnal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd be tired if I didn't.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, I think—

**Speaker B:** yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** And so getting— and, and I don't know, I mean, I'll be honest, my

**Speaker B:** sleep and wake schedule is not consistent. I think that could be important.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it can be good to work out.

**Speaker B:** Just go to sleep when it's— and

**Speaker D:** I'm— it's an ongoing process for me too, but I heard from, uh, a teacher one time where he was like, okay, after 11 o'clock at night you need to stop thinking and just shut down the thinking part of your brain because like that's just going to be helpful for you.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's cool. That's like a sleep app. I'm going to try that.

**Speaker D:** I mean, I'm not doing it right now because it's after 11 o'clock at night, but you know, yeah, but he thought it would be helpful. For me. I don't know, just when I described— if you look, so the reason that he said it to me, I think, is he was like, if you look at most of the problems that you've had in your life, like what time of the day, like in relationships and things like this, like what time of the day did it occur? And he was— he did have a point there that like, yeah, late at night tends to be when a lot of conflict happens in relationships. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker D:** But it's also good to just not be too hard on yourself and make like new rules and new regulations and things like this. And then, well, that's the thing. And look into like— if I make

**Speaker B:** that a rule, then I'll like introduce more people to the system.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** It's helpful, man. It's helpful. It's helpful. It's like it's a complicated sort of problem. It's weird. It's because I have the skill to stop suffering and also to stop caring, because I've recognized clearly the connection between desire and suffering. And now that I've recognized that, my brain has the ability to just like kind of not care about things that it used to not be able to not care about. So I used— it was impossible for me to not care about the future except for temporarily by gladdening the mind. Now it's possible for me to just like kind of tap into that, like whenever I kind of want to. So it's like that. It's like I've developed— you gotta keep

**Speaker D:** looking into it though. Sometimes, sometimes our minds can like think like, okay, I've already had this realization, I've had this point of wisdom, like time to not have to look into the First Noble Truth anymore, you know. Uh, like, and that's like a constant reminder to like constantly come back to it and like not view it as like baby teachings or something like that, you know. But like It's just, you have to just— that's good. That's good. That's not like you can make this

**Speaker B:** like more complex system of like a method, but it's like, that's like that, like you said, that was me sneakily sneaking. And like the baby teachings that I thought that, oh, I'm beyond that now, I need the more complex teaching. It's like, no, we return again, again, again. Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker A:** That's good, dude.

**Speaker B:** That's good. That's really helped me. That's really helped me come up with more clarity. And the biggest thing that it's helped me with is because exactly what I was trying to do, like unconsciously without recognizing it, which I didn't call, was create a more complicated system for neurodoing individual specific emotions. So this is how I'm going to neurodo sadness, but no, return to just the basics.

**Speaker D:** You don't need to focus so much on emotions, you know, like you just don't, you just don't have to. Like, like, like it's, it's one of the main faults that I've seen in my own practice is putting like way too big of an emphasis on my current emotional state, you know, and judging my practice based on what that emotional state consists of.

**Speaker B:** That's gold. That is gold, dude. That's the whole thing with Anagami and Hinayana that sucks. He's like— and this is like kind of what led into my whole like thing of like, like my first 3 calls with Dhammarato I was trying to put together a model of how the whole thing was going to play out and look, because Daniel Ingram's model had zero correlation to my actual experience until I started doing Dhammarato's technique, funnily enough. But like with his thing, he's like, when you're in this Jhana, you do this, and when you're in this Jhana, you do this. And then you have this whole other problem with which Jhana I'm in, and then you don't ever notice them because you can't notice them until you're already like happy. Like you don't notice them until you're kind of clapping.

**Speaker D:** But the answer is always the same, and it's come back to the present moment and just come back to your breathing and see what's going on in your body and investigate from that point and investigate from a point of ease and freedom, you know. So it's the same instructions over and over again, no matter what, like there's no difference, you know. Um, do you guys— I just want to ask, do you know if, uh, Dhammarato is like okay again with his neck?

**Speaker B:** He said 2 to 3 days, about actually 2 days ago. So he might be, he might be. I was going to call tomorrow.

**Speaker D:** He hurt his neck. I guess it's an ongoing thing and he just hasn't been taking calls for the last week.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, he might be available today. If not today, tomorrow. I was going to do tomorrow, but yeah.

**Speaker D:** I decided to check in because I haven't talked to him in a while. That's cool, man, that's cool. But I should check in.

**Speaker B:** It's tricky, man, because my mind is so tempted to just use— Sorry, go ahead, go ahead. I'm sorry, I'm going on about the same thing. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, no, like no scheduled time. I talk to him when I have something in mind to talk about, once a month, something like that.

**Speaker D:** I always like your calls. Yeah, I've watched a lot of your calls.

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna start watching them. I want to take your advice, Joe. I like Kishon's calls. I watch tons of his. Um, actually, I haven't seen any of, um, Muhammad's. Yeah, do you guys relate to what I mean when it's like, it's kind of difficult when you have the skill to stop like suffering? It's difficult not to use it and like a wrong way, not to use it to justify being lazy or taking wrong speech and stuff. Like, it makes, it makes it difficult.

**Speaker D:** You got to get over this worry about being lazy and this, like, worry about being unproductive.

**Speaker B:** And like, it's not about productivity. I don't give a shit about that.

**Speaker D:** Okay, but there's nothing wrong with being lazy. Like, there's nothing wrong with, like, you're, you know, it's, it's okay. Like, you know, is As long as you're sitting there and you're safe and at ease, like, that's all that matters, you know? Like, that's like— you just have to keep coming back to that and keep reminding yourself of that over and over again, because your mind, your mind is going to jump to like, oh my God, what's my future going to be like? What am I going to get for a job? What am I going to get for a career? How am I going to get enough money? And Oh my God, like, like, you

**Speaker B:** know, actually that's true, dude, that's true. I was doing that softly and I was ignoring it and I was pretending it wasn't a problem because I wasn't like in the hindrances. But that's true, you can, you can have like negative thoughts without it being in the hindrances. That's true.

**Speaker D:** I mean, it's, it's always ongoing because it's been shoved down our throats that if we don't have a job and if we're not productive, we're gonna starve to death. And that's not reality, you know, it's not reality-based. Your reality right now is you're not starving, you're fine, perfectly fine the way that you are, and you've made it to the point where you're at right now, and you don't need to worry so much, you know. And it's the main problem that we all struggle with is just over-worrying, you know. And like, you just have to catch it, and it's— and it can be sneaky at times, and catch up with you in different ways, you know, of like— like you were getting at that when you were like, is it okay to like use my ability to tap into Sukkha, uh, in like bad ways? And like that, but that's not— it's not possible if you're satisfied, like, and you're actually feeling Sukkha and not Dukkha. Like, it's— it's not possible to like use it for— for bad or whatever, because Harm, because it's harmlessness, you know, like this is like one of the key things in Buddhism is like is harmlessness, you know, is friendship, like, you know, being friends with ourselves first, you know, and then being friends with others, wishing well for others, you know. Yeah, thank you, thank you, because why not? Because why not? We have the choice right now. We can feel really great or we can be sort of stuck in a state of worrying.

**Speaker B:** Don't you know which— I feel great, I feel great, like whenever I want, literally done, done. That's the problem. Look, it's like I have like zero self-control, and I don't mean that in like some spiritual, like no-self way. I just mean like I, I don't control what I do because that's great.

**Speaker D:** That's great. So like the next time, because it's

**Speaker B:** not a problem, it's not leading to anywhere wrong.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah, but you said earlier today, you were like, oh, after I like am sad and cry for 2 hours. So the next time you're in one of those things and are crying for 2 hours, yeah, do that, you know.

**Speaker B:** Oh dude, this is like so complicated, man, because I get this ability to be able to do this, and then all of my negative shit— it's complicated because I get the ability and then I might lose it for 2 hours. I don't know, man. I'm gonna call you back.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you could, you could lose it for a couple of years and it wouldn't have gone anywhere because it's always still there, you know? Like, the ability to feel okay in the present is always there. It's always with us, right? Like, and you wish that for others. Like, that's the main thing.

**Speaker B:** You're correct, you're correct. I can't, I can't do it under all conditions. I can only do it if I lose all my self-control and, you know, whatever.

**Speaker D:** Like, I just want to say, so you, so you're very aware of like what how much it sucks, like, to be stuck in a bad state of mind. So, and you also know what it's like to be in a good state of mind. And you know, most people are really, really stuck in this other state of mind. So you're wishing them well, you know, like, you're wishing for everybody. And as much as you can, you try your best to help them out because, like, you know what it's like. And this, and this is the, the sort of thing, you know, but it doesn't turn into trying to save the world.

**Speaker B:** I get it. I get it.

**Speaker D:** I get it. It's just you're just wishing everybody well

**Speaker B:** because it's for yourself.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So I think, I think that actually you do need to kind of believe in the future because hear me out. If I feel satisfied now, I'm thinking that this is perfect and that might be true, but I could make it more perfect if I introduce Metta practice like you just described. And so let's say in this moment, in this present moment, I'm not talking about future, I'm just saying in this moment, for me to start feeling goodwill towards others takes a little bit of effort. But because I believe it's going to lead to something even better, then I do it. And so, and then at least something better. And then my mind retrains itself to get like to the next level.

**Speaker D:** And then they're like, the best way to rewrite your future to be awesome is for it to be awesome right now. Because your past will be made up of memories that you're making in the present exactly right now. You know, so the best way to make an awesome future is to— I love that, man.

**Speaker B:** It's like how Arahant, the Arhat, was building it.

**Speaker D:** It's so great being able to spend time with my two friends here and chat about the Dhamma and not be doing whatever else I was normally doing before this, you know. How awesome, you know? And I can look back at this and have some good memories to write, you know, in my subconscious, you know? And isn't that nice? And, you know, that's— I don't know.

**Speaker B:** No, no, I think what I think it is, I think it is— I was kind of hoping that I'd get like some quick easy answer that would resolve my problem. I think this is going to be like a time bomb teaching where I'm going to— what we've said here, I'm going to release into it, and then over the coming days and weeks it's going to become relevant because I'm going to be trying to implement what you said, and then I'm going to start to figure it out. Like, it's not going to be like, I'll just figure it out now.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. So we have to, we have to be patient with where we're at and allow the process to just go like as it's going. But that doesn't mean that we're not doing anything. Uh, like Muhammad was pointing out earlier to me where he was like, you, you have to actively aim for the tranquility, you know. That's a good thing to remember. Because you can't just sit around and wait and be like, hey, I'm gonna meditate.

**Speaker B:** It's not good enough.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and that's going to automatically do it, because if I'm meditating with the incorrect attitude going into it, then it's not going to. But then at the same time, having faith that like if I just keep continuing with this practice, there are some natural conditions. I'm rewiring my brain to think in a super mundane way. In a way that normal people do not think, you know. Like, that's— if you want a sutta to read, read Sutta 48, okay? It lays out, uh, 7 different ways that, uh, Srotapanna thinks in a super mundane way compared to a non-Srotapanna, or whatever.

**Speaker B:** Stop touching me.

**Speaker D:** So, so it's perfect for you.

**Speaker B:** My ego loves that. He's like,

**Speaker D:** yeah, permanent, permanent. Dhammarato says that about the Sutta. He's like, I've heard him talk about 48, and he's like, the people on Reddit should be all over Sutta 48. It lays out exactly what you have to do to be a stream-enterer. For some reason, everybody's on Reddit talking about God knows what, and it lays out right there perfectly, Sutta 48, in like 7 lines. These are the 7 things that separate you.

**Speaker B:** I was on BHO, and there's like so many threads there where people are talking about their Dark Nights and stuff and how they're like they think it's like a good thing that they're suffering because it's a dark night, and they're like using that book to justify it. And I'm just like, y'all need Dhammarato. Like, get out of the dark night and then, you know, you know, get somewhere good and then start strategizing, whatever the hell.

**Speaker D:** But you also have to have balance and see where that comes from. And so like, a lot of times it comes from people having like negative experiences when they have improper meditation technique and not understanding why.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's like it's partially correct, but it's missing a lot.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And so it's like, hmm, so I'm doing this a bit wrong, and I'm getting like this result from it. Like, why is it— and everybody's getting the same result. Like, if you— if like, I've been involved in the Goenka tradition, so I've seen it, you know, and it's like everybody's stuck in the exact same spot. And you're like, how is this all leading to the same spot? We all have these stories about this awesome experience, but then you talk to people and they are like just completely not functioning right in the exact same way. Well, imagine that we're all imbalanced in the exact same way. We're all striving way too hard, you know, like that's the main thing with Goenka's thing is he's like, you know, meditate 12 hours a day or 16 hours a day or whatever stupid thing that he tells you to do. And it's totally imbalanced.

**Speaker A:** I never watch the clock when I meditate. I never do.

**Speaker B:** I like that. I

**Speaker A:** don't think it doesn't help the practice. It stresses you out. It makes you stressed. Oh, what time is it? Should I meditate more or less? No, you should enjoy it. When you play a game, do you catch the time when you play a game? You don't. Just enjoy it. That's it, that's the attitude of meditation.

**Speaker D:** And what Dhammarato, I've heard him say that I've really been trying to take in recently, is he's like, when your attention span is no longer there, and you know for yourself when it's no longer there, that's just it, that's how long your meditation should be.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe push yourself a little bit to see how you— Yeah, of course. When you're frustrated, then yeah, let go.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. You know, like, it's like, yeah, of course you can't sit there and be like, my attention span is only 5 minutes. But I'm talking more to people who, like, I mean, for me, like, I've generally gone the other direction of like sitting way longer than realistically I should have been at that point for myself, you know. Whereas like, now I can just sit because it's not actually like meditating really. It's just kind of like sitting there. I can do it for like as long as my body like can do it because it's just enjoyable, you know? Like that's the reality of it versus before it was like, I knew exactly when it was 55 minutes because like the last 5 minutes were so difficult to make it to that 1-hour mark, you know? And like, it's like, man, I could have just relaxed. Like, you know, how many of those 5-minute periods that I waste of just like waiting for the bell to ring, you know, it's like, yeah, it's so stupid.

**Speaker A:** Meditation is fun, really it's fun. I mean, yeah, you can do a lot of things in meditation, a lot of types of concentration, a lot of types of insights. I mean, when you really get good at it, I mean, it's gonna be your personal thing, you know, your meditation. But there are a lot of things that like you could investigate.

**Speaker D:** Do you have any tips for things that are interesting that you enjoy? Concepts. Do you have any tips, Mohammed?

**Speaker B:** Oh, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Do you have any tips for different things that you've enjoyed doing?

**Speaker A:** Well, there's the body. I mean, just get in touch with the body. You can do a lot of stuff with the body. I mean, you can heal yourself, you can relax yourself, you can imagine. I think Goenka does that. I'm not sure, I didn't really look. But I mean, you can start by touching yourself, but you should get to the point where you mentally visualize your legs and that kind of stuff. And make things open, make it relaxed. I mean, you can really relax a lot internally, be fine being inside the body. You know, when you are inside the body, you can cut off the five hindrances very well. Be fine with that. And yeah, I mean, you can get really good insights with that, like when you get deeper in the meditation, you can feel a little bit of space, and you can get insights into perceptions and becoming. I mean, these are the trickiest things. I mean, don't get lost if anything happens, because they can be really tricky insights of perceptions and becomings, and you know, you can get your senses, they get sharp.

**Speaker D:** What do you mean by becoming?

**Speaker A:** Your state of, you know, we create the sense of I, right? The becoming, it's always happening, really nonstop, and you really can't direct it. You see the becoming happening, and to stop it is really difficult, but you can like put it in a certain direction. It's kind of changing the future a little bit. That's the tricky thing. It's like creating yourself the way you want it to be.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's so helpful for me. Like I can create myself that way

**Speaker A:** by holding some different perceptions. And take hold of even more stuff. There is clinging in it. I mean, this is why these insights, they are a little bit tricky because there is clinging in it. So there is going to be suffering. It's okay. It's fun, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but you got to think of it as like you're suffering willingly, so it's good suffering, right?

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, I mean, that's almost incorrect. You should not, no, no, there's no good suffering.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** No, that's a red line, that there is no good suffering. Suffering is always bad. But you kind of understand how these things happen, how you get perceptions and that kind of stuff. And how your body works, how you see your consciousness works. And you can do a lot of healing. I mean, I don't know, if you don't feel well, or if you have some pain in your body, you can make it go away. You can do Metta meditation. I mean, Metta meditation is really awesome. There's one time I really, it was so sweet. One time I did Metta meditation, it worked so well, really, really well. It was so sweet, that Metta feeling. It was so sweet and it spread to everyone around. And I think it's mentioned in one of the suttas, the experience waft of goodwill. It was so strong that it's really amazing. And you can see these things affecting yourself and affecting people. I mean, I got people telling me, why are you always happy? I told them, I'm just happy. You know, why would I be not happy, right? Why would I be suffering? I just choose to be happy. You can do a lot of things with meditation. How you speak to yourself, how you speak to others, and how you shape your personality kind of thing. I mean, just investigate it, discover it.

**Speaker B:** That's what I want. I want to have the happiness of me. Not caring about anything of what anyone thinks about me, but still being like a good— like having morality, being a good person who has right speech. And, and, um, and as— and to be fair, there's a lot of ego in this as well. There's a lot of like ego in this as well. And, and like, is the way that I want to be, you know?

**Speaker D:** Well, you want to be— so let's see, going there, you want to be perfect, so to get there you have to accept that right now you're not perfect. You know, like that you have to like accept the imperfections that you have like within you and work towards that and realize it's an ongoing process that you're working at. That's really awesome because I've had people tell me that before, like they're like, I'm kind of like annoyed that you like smile so much or something, or they'll be like, oh, that's like essentially Anagami.

**Speaker A:** I'm so annoyed.

**Speaker B:** Or if I'd like start like giving someone advice, I'm only like 22, you're like, you're not really allowed to know how to meditate and stuff. And I think they think I'm some like arrogant asshole, which I am, but like, you know what I mean? Like, I'd be like so concerned.

**Speaker D:** I'll get it sometimes that people are like, because I'm in France and they're like, oh, all Americans, you guys are just so fake happy. And I'm like, I'm like, no, I'm actually like just happy, you know? Like, I'm just happy to see you. Like, you know, my neighbor He's like annoyed that because every day I'm like, bonjour, and he's like, it's like, bonjour, like every day, you know. And I think he thinks I'm like making it up or something, and I'm like, no, I'm actually like, I'm glad to see you again, you know.

**Speaker B:** That's so cool though, you're so happy that people think you're faking it because you're just such a happy guy. That's amazing, man. That's amazing progress.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And then you're just like, whatever. I mean, that's fine. I, I mean, I've had people literally tell me that it's annoying. They're like, oh, it's like annoying that you're smiling in situations situations where you shouldn't be smiling. I'm like, okay, I'll like, I'll do the opposite, you know. But it's, it just becomes easier, it becomes a habit. It's like, why not? Why not smile, you know? All right, I gotta get going, guys. I'm getting a little bit tired.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's cool, that's cool, man.

**Speaker D:** Okay, thank you so much. I really think you should be a Dhamma teacher, Muhammad. I, I think it's awesome, like, listening to your advice and stuff. That's cool. So I really, I hope we can, uh, talk again soon.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I really enjoyed this, uh, talk after.

**Speaker B:** You're so pure, man.

**Speaker C:** I love it. Like, it's so pure.

**Speaker B:** Like, I have all this, like, ego and stuff. All right, good night, guys.

**Speaker D:** See you, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Ciao ciao.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and involving several Sangha friends, centers on a practitioner (Speaker B, likely Robert) grappling with the side-effects of his meditation practice — specifically, a cycle of intense energetic happiness (*piti*) followed by anger, emotional numbness, and interpersonal difficulties.

Here is a structured summary of the core themes and advice given:

### **Core Problem (Speaker B's Experience)**
*   **The Piti-Tranquility Cycle:** He describes getting stuck in a loop: he achieves a state of energetic, euphoric happiness (*piti*), but cannot settle into the deeper, peaceful tranquility that should follow. When he tries to relax, he feels a loss and then gets angry.
*   **Emotional Bypassing & Impulsivity:** In the *piti* state, he feels "all-powerful" and detached, leading to poor self-control, interrupting people, and being inconsiderate (e.g., ignoring his boyfriend). He recognizes this isn't true peace but a kind of spiritual bypassing where he uses meditation technique to suppress suffering without addressing root causes.
*   **The "Good Enough" Trap:** He has developed a skill of instantly gladdening his mind to eliminate any discomfort. This leads to apathy about personal conduct ("Why not vape if I can be happy anyway?") and a lack of motivation for virtuous action.

### **Key Advice and Insights from the Group**

1.  **Return to Basics & Relax the Body (Speakers A, C, D):**
    *   The advice is to stop over-complicating things. Go back to the fundamentals of *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing): focus on the long breath, notice bodily sensations, and consciously **relax**. Tranquility (*passaddhi*) is not something that just happens; you create the conditions for it by relaxing the body and mind.

2.  **Look Beyond Emotions to Clinging (Speaker A, Muhammad):**
    *   The group advises not to get fixated on emotional states (happiness, anger). These are superficial "shells."
    *   The real work is to investigate the **underlying clinging and attachments** that fabricate those emotions. What unacknowledged stress, desire, or guilt is fueling the cycle? True practice involves bringing light to these hidden conditionings.

3.  **Redefine True Happiness (Speaker A, Muhammad):**
    *   A crucial correction is offered: The Buddha's "true happiness" is **peace** (*santi*), the satisfaction of the cessation of craving. It is not the exciting, euphoric *piti* or a state of careless indifference.
    *   The goal is to be **beyond** the tug-of-war of negative emotions, not just to be "okay" with them while they rage.

4.  **Right View Comes First (Speaker D, Joe):**
    *   The discussion highlights that trying to perfect moral conduct (*sīla*) without **Right View** is putting the cart before the horse. Right View—a deep, experiential understanding of the Four Noble Truths—is the foundation. Without it, efforts at right speech or action can become just another ego project or source of tension.

5.  **Avoid the "Final Solution" Mentality (Speaker D, Joe):**
    *   Speaker B is repeatedly cautioned against his mind's tendency to seek a new, complex technique or a "retreat" as a final solution. This is just another form of clinging.
    *   The answer is always the same: come back to the present moment, the breath, and a gentle investigation from a place of ease. The practice is available **now**, not in a future ideal setting.

6.  **Integrate Practice into Life, Don't Force It (Various):**
    *   The talk warns against the grim, striving approach of long, forced meditation sessions. Meditation should be **enjoyable**, like playing a game. Sit until your attention naturally wanes, not against the clock.
    *   Create seclusion in daily life, but don't idolize formal retreats as the only path.

### **Conclusion**
The talk serves as an intervention for a practitioner who has developed strong concentration but is misapplying it, leading to hedonistic and detached behavior. The collective guidance steers him back to the core principles:

*   **From *Piti* to Peace:** Aim for tranquil peace, not exciting euphoria.
*   **From Bypassing to Investigating:** Use mindfulness to uncover clinging, not to suppress symptoms.
*   **From Complexity to Simplicity:** Return to relaxing the body and breath.
*   **From Future Solutions to Present Moment:** The Dhamma is to be practiced in the fabric of daily life, right now.

The underlying message is one of course-correction: moving from a self-centered, pleasure-seeking application of meditation toward a genuine, integrated path grounded in Right View, leading to true peace and harmlessness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key metaphors and stories used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Egg Metaphor (Speaker A):** Used to explain the relationship between emotions and clinging.
    *   **Quote:** "You know, emotions is like, if it's an egg, The emotions is the shell, it's outside, it's like the drawing, it's not the essence of it. The essence is the clinging."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that emotions are superficial manifestations of a deeper attachment (clinging). To go deep in meditation, one must look past the "shell" of the emotion to the "yolk" of the attachment.

2.  **Rap Music Video Metaphor (Speaker B):** Used to describe a state of ego-driven, aggressive happiness.
    *   **Quote:** "I feel like the perfect metaphor is like those, you know, those like rap music videos where the rappers are all like, you know, we shot your gang, we are the best gang, everything's lit in our gang, your gang sucks."
    *   **Purpose:** To vividly convey a state of piti (rapture) that feels powerful and euphoric but is also arrogant, divisive, and lacking in care for others.

3.  **Fire Metaphor (Attributed to "Kishon") (Speaker B):** Used to explain learning from suffering.
    *   **Quote:** "Kishon said, like, I learned that putting my hand in this fire, like, sucks, so I took it out."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the simple, cause-and-effect wisdom of the First Noble Truth. Suffering (dukkha) teaches you what to let go of, just as fire teaches you to remove your hand.

4.  **Idol Worship / The Retreat as an Idol (Speaker D):** Used to warn against spiritual bypassing and clinging to concepts.
    *   **Quote:** "It's another like solution, right? It's like idol worship... It's like I'm worshiping the idol of, oh yeah, if I just do a 10-day retreat my brain will automatically like stop wanting like stuff."
    *   **Purpose:** To caution against the mind's tendency to cling to future solutions (like a retreat) as a "magic bullet," instead of practicing in the present moment.

5.  **Leveling Up / Video Game Metaphor (Speaker B):** Used to describe the ego's view of spiritual progress.
    *   **Quote:** "So I'm like a level up... I'm going to develop a new, more advanced approach."
    *   **Purpose:** To critique his own tendency to see practice as a linear game of achieving higher "levels" of technique or understanding, which is another form of clinging and strategizing.

6.  **Hunter-Gatherer Eating Analogy (Speaker D):** Used to investigate habit vs. physical need.
    *   **Quote:** "Our bodies are kind of like designed for this because as like hunter-gatherers traditionally, we would have come across a lot of food, eaten a lot, and then had periods where we like didn't eat so much."
    *   **Purpose:** To frame a late-night desire for food not as a bodily necessity but as a modern habit, encouraging investigation into the mental vs. physical origins of craving.

### **Stories & References**

1.  **The Story of Being "Stuck" in a Tradition (Speaker D):** A personal anecdote about the Goenka retreat tradition.
    *   **Content:** He describes how a whole group of meditators, following the same intense (and imbalanced) technique, all end up "completely not functioning right in the exact same way." He links this to striving too hard and misinterpreting the instruction to "be aware of whatever is going on right now, don't try to change reality."
    *   **Purpose:** To warn that improper technique, even in a popular system, can lead to widespread, predictable suffering ("Dark Nights") and stagnation, and to contrast it with the active, gladdening approach being discussed.

2.  **The Story of the Hotel vs. The Retreat Center (Speaker D):** A reference to someone else's experience (likely "Dan").
    *   **Quote:** "Sometimes the conditions... were better for me to practice in a hotel in Thailand than they were at the retreat center."
    *   **Purpose:** To de-mystify the idea of retreats and emphasize that ideal practice conditions are internal (the mind's attitude) not external (a special location).

3.  **Reference to Sutta 48 (Speaker D):** A specific scriptural reference.
    *   **Quote:** "If you want a sutta to read, read Sutta 48... It lays out exactly what you have to do to be a stream-enterer."
    *   **Purpose:** To ground the conversation in the Buddha's teachings and provide a concrete resource that clearly outlines the factors of a "sotapanna" (stream-enterrer), contrasting with over-complicated modern models.

4.  **The "Aha, I see you, Mara" Story (Speaker C):** A reference to a common Buddhist story where the Buddha recognizes a hindrance as a manifestation of Mara (the tempter).
    *   **Quote:** "Even with the aha, I see you, Mara, right? Or ex-hindrance, right?"
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the moment of mindfulness where a hindrance (like anger or pride) is recognized for what it is—an impersonal, passing phenomenon—and thereby loses its power.

**Overall Purpose of These Metaphors and Stories:** They serve to make abstract Dharma concepts (piti, clinging, right view, impermanence) relatable and tangible. They are used for **diagnosis** (the rap video shows arrogant piti), **instruction** (the egg teaches where to look), **warning** (the idol worship and Goenka stories highlight pitfalls), and **encouragement** (the fire metaphor simplifies the path). The dialogue itself becomes a story of someone (Speaker B) grappling with the side-effects of his practice, using these metaphors to understand his experience.
