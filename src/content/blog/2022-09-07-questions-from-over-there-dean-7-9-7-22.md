### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and turn the recorder on. All right, it depends upon— After losing your video, Dhammarato. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I'm after losing your video, I just have a picture of you.

**Speaker A:** How about now?

**Speaker B:** There you are, big man.

**Speaker A:** Okay. There is a way or a form of sense restraint that the Buddha talked about, and some people grab it like a puppy with a ball and run all over the yard with it. Okay. And so, in the sense of sense restraint, the Buddha talks about guarding the eye door, guarding the ear door, in the sense of paying attention to what you look at, and take control over that. To pay attention to what you hear, and take control over that. So that you avoid going into situations where you have to hear things that are not appropriate, unwholesome, derogatory, hateful. And so you avoid that. And in the practice for the monks going around, Bhante Pat, that the way that the Buddha taught was to keep the eyes focused where you're going. All right, and he recommended about 2 bow lengths, which is about 2 heights of a human. An ox cart length is another way of saying it. In other words, you're watching where you're going so that you can easily walk around and avoid things that may enter your path. Like for instance, potholes or stickers or extra heavy rocks or humans or animals coming into the road, all of that kind of stuff is only that you're using your eyes to watch where you're going so that you can proceed safely. That the monks, while they're on Venerable Arhat, do not gawk and look around. And see what there is to see, finding some legs to stare at, or some piece of cloth, which is what people do in ordinary life. But the Buddha says, "No, pay attention to what you're looking at. Pay attention to your sense restraints." Now, the puppy that grabs that teaching and runs off with it, means that he's supposed to think that he's supposed to guard his senses so well that he closes them down, so that he's not watching where he's going, and he's not paying attention to anything that he's listening to, rather than paying close attention to what he's listening to. Right? That's the difference, is that many people get the wrong idea, they go really overboard. Does that answer your question?

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, it does. Yeah, it does. Um, um, and is virtue then tied into sense restraint? What is— sorry, what virtue?

**Speaker A:** What is— that's a good question. What is it? Is not virtue any and anything, any and everything you want it to be, and it is not what you don't want it to be? I mean, that's a very, very difficult word to define correctly.

**Speaker B:** Well, I would say someone who is selfish wouldn't be virtuous.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I would say that someone who's selfish would not be virtuous.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. That would be true in the sense of people taking things that are not given, because that's what selfishness is. Okay, and so he's taking things that are not given, which means then that he is actually creating Dukkha or dissatisfaction in other people. Right. Okay, so is not then, as we're beginning to define virtue, really a good place to start and maybe even to end up, is back to the teaching of the Buddha? Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now, often in the West, because of the Catholic Church, in many different situations, virtue is assumed to be good behavior, that's specifically good behavior. Where the Buddhist teaching is, is that good behavior is the avoidance of transmitting Dukkha in word, speech, or actions. That if you're harming things by the way that you speak, and harming things by the way that you're acting, then that would be the issue. Right? But in the West, we've got a double duty. You've got to do good things in order to be virtuous. So, virtuous actually is not even the issue at all. The real issue is what state of mind are you in? If you're in the state of mind of being selfish, then you'll do selfish things and harm people. But being in a state of selfishness is actually being in a state of Dukkha anyway. So all you're doing is spreading your Dukkha. If you have no Dukkha to spread, then you're not spreading any Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's why I suppose I was asking. I can see how self-restraint is kind of tied into virtue, because like you said, it's about transmitting Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** And you're using a new word now, self-restraint. You recognize that's a new word.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, senseless. I suppose like the more you keep grabbing for things, that's causing suffering for yourself, is it not? If they're unwholesome things and if you overindulge, is that going to cause you more suffering?

**Speaker A:** No, you're wanting something. Is the creation of the suffering. Ignorantly wanting something that we don't have, that's the whole show. The results of all of that may be just another event of suffering or Dukkha, dissatisfaction. But wanting something you don't have is a dissatisfying state right then and there. And it puts us into actions. And those actions that we go into may in fact be unwholesome actions based upon the unwholesome feelings that we had because of the unwholesome thoughts of wanting something that we don't have.

**Speaker B:** Okay. He also talks about that, Dhammarato. I know you said Dhammarato, you're catching on.

**Speaker A:** Wait a minute, don't go to where I've said you're talking about him. Go ahead and please talk about him.

**Speaker B:** Okay, he often says, he talks about endurance of the suffering sometimes, and sometimes then you, like where you, what we're learning from you is when you look at what you're doing, if it's unwholesome, throw it out. But he sometimes is talking about enduring the suffering?

**Speaker A:** Well, there is a sense of having to endure things when not enduring them will create a whole lot of suffering. An example of that is that if a child has broken their arm, they need to let it rest for a few weeks and keep it in a cast. And then they're going to endure having that broken arm in its healing process, which has a whole lot of itching inside of it, as well as the cast itself is uncomfortable. And the child has to learn to deal with that for the duration. And one of the ways of dealing with it is to actually— and some doctors are doing it— actually cast up the hand also, to the point that the child can't use their hand. Normally when they break their arm, they still want to hold the arm still, because that's what's broken, and using the hand to do all kinds of things, not recognizing that the hand can't move without the muscles around that broken area moving. So you have to sterilize the hand also, and keep it still, so that the arm will heal. That's a way of talking about it. Now there's more to it than that, so hang in there with me. Have you ever heard of AA, Alcoholics Anonymous? They have a prayer, all right? The prayer is, grant me the serenity to endure the things that I cannot change, and the courage to change the things that I can change, and the wisdom to know the difference. Okay, so we're talking about then, we cannot often change the things that are on the outside, but we can change the things on the inside. And in that regard, whoever there is that's teaching perhaps is not talking about enduring the things that can be fixed. Why should we do that? Let's get some wisdom in there and figure out that we can fix that one and fix it. And those things that we can't fix, we can handle it, we can endure it. This is in fact the teaching of Upekkha. So let me give you this example, and that is of the Brahma Viharas: the Metta, Mudita, Karuna, and Upekkha. And the example is a medical doctor. He has friendliness and a desire to help And so he becomes a doctor. And then with his patients, he has great compassion. He wants them to not feel so bad. If he's got a good side manner, then he's going to be cheerful and help those people get over it with Mudita. But every one of his patients is going to die. Every one of them. Maybe not this year, but every doctor's patient, every one of them, dies. How can the doctor handle the fact that he's having his patients die right in front of him while he's trying to cheer them up? What's the point? This is what often happens with people in those kinds of professions, and they call it burnout. What is the burnout? They're not actually capable people are wise enough to recognize that they can't do anything about it now that the person is dead. Can't do anything, except continue with the cheer and the joy, because you can't fix it. Now, in that regard, that's even wiser than enduring something, like the doctor enduring the fact that his patients die. No, he needs real wisdom to recognize that he is a failure, but he's a marvelous hero of a failure, because he can, in fact, get over the fact that his patients die, and continue practicing medicine happily. So, in that regard, we can come back to this idea of enduring Dukkha, or enduring dissatisfaction. Is that, are we going to find a way of coming out of our dissatisfaction with what we're doing, or what's happened, or what the event is? And let it be, that we don't have to continue being dissatisfied. That's the issue. The real Upekkha is getting over your dissatisfaction with the things you can't fix, and government's one of them. You can't fix government. No one can. And everyone who tries gets trapped in it, and winds up becoming one of the crocodiles in the very pond that they wanted to drain, the very swamp that they wanted to drain. They become one of the crocodiles. Knowing that, staying out of politics is good restraint of the senses. Stay away.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Okay.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Arhant] You cannot fix things on the outside, so why should I be dissatisfied with this or that politician? I can't fix it anyway, so why just not be satisfied that politics is a mess? No matter what country you go to, politics in that country is a mess. And we can be satisfied with that. We don't have to endure bad politics. We can get over that. Okay? So, in this regard, it almost winds up, in every case, mental. Even the child who has the broken arm can eventually get over it, and say, "All right, I'm resigned to leaving my hand still, my arm has to heal, and I can keep it still." And by doing that intentionally and enduring that, the arm actually heals much quicker. Okay. Okay? So, does that answer your question about enduring? Okay.

**Speaker B:** That was— yeah, um, uprooting suffering rather than management. What is meant by that?

**Speaker A:** Sorry, what?

**Speaker B:** Uprooting rather than managing?

**Speaker A:** Well.

**Speaker B:** Is that further.

**Speaker A:** There's several techniques with that. I don't think that there's anything that the Buddha ever said about uprooting. Let me give you this example. Imagine that you were going to be weeding your garden. You can, in fact, if the weed is the correct size, you can grab it and pull it up. But you got to dig down to see what the root is and grab it and pull it up. You can do that. But now there's the possibility that you're trying to remove a weed that's out on the sidewalk with the cement that the government has put up. And their government, that government is not going to be happy that you're digging up their cement just so You can grab a root of a weed and pull it out. So how are you going to manage that weed? The way to handle that management of that weed is every time it comes up with a shoot, you whack it off. You don't ever let the root of that weed get a leaf. So that it can get some daylight, some sunshine, get some energy, get some growth. You want to whack it off before it gets to that state. And when that happens over and over and over and over, day after day, month after month, year after year perhaps, what's going to happen to that root that gets no nourishment? Is it not going to die out? You didn't have to dig up concrete, didn't have to make a great big mess. Okay, this is the teaching of the Buddha, the Anapanasati, to where I would say often that there's other meditation techniques, perhaps the Mahayana method, to where they want to go root hunting, and so here they go digging looking for things, hoping that they can find something that they could, you know, take as a prize, or dig it up and pull it out. But Anapanasati talks about it in the sense of, in this moment, to remember to look at what you're thinking, and if it says— if that's that unwholesome weed that's popping up into the mind, whack that off and get back into Osho, whatever you want to grow in your garden. It's the same teaching. Just keep doing that over and over again, and the weeds will die out. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** It's safe to say though, that the weeds can always grow back, and I'm— the weeds, no matter how much you whack them off.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's true for the beginner.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because I have heard stories of people who have progressed down the Jhanas, and when they got to the fourth Jhana, and whatever way they worked the fourth Jhana, they were able to dissolve something in their brain, or in their mind, and they changed from that part on. And that, I know you don't really like to talk about, but that's how—.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole thing about waking up. If you're you're in— actually, if you're in the fourth Jhana and you know to remove unwholesome thoughts— see, it's quite possible for people to be in the fourth Jhana and don't know that they have to remove unwholesome thoughts. That's the problem with the fourth Jhana, that you've got to enter it correctly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But what I'm saying is, you don't— here's the point right now, is that you do not understand at all what the fourth jhana is. It's just a mental concept for you. So all the questions that you— so all of the questions that you have about it are going to be based upon that concept.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, people often have entered the fourth jhana, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** How do you know that?

**Speaker B:** Because I believe them.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and they're out there advertising it.

**Speaker B:** Well, I've heard it on some podcasts, Dhammarato. Yeah, I've heard people went looking for suffering, or they've watched their rising and passing away on Vajrayana, and something happened, and when they were finished, they were just different. And that's what they call a Srotapanna, is it not? Or a stream-enterer, when that happens.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point. How do you know what to call it.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm just saying what I'm— what I heard.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole— right, I, I know that. That's the whole idea, is, is that you've got a whole lot of questions based upon a very limited understanding of the words that you've heard of people using on podcasts. And, um, one of the more important things is that the people who are saying that kind of stuff have never been Bhikkhus, they've never been ordained within the Bhikkhu Sangha. Where the situation goes is that you can discuss what you have done with your teacher, but that you don't advertise it in the community of the monks, and you don't advertise it to lay people. You don't say what attainments that you have. Okay, that this is just not something that's done. It's impolite to do so, and it's also quite harmful. And then one of the ways it is harmful is it makes some of people in your audience jealous of things they don't even know what it is.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, yeah, well, look, yeah, that's no problem. But it is safe to say, I suppose, then, that not all of those people are lying.

**Speaker A:** I didn't say that they were lying. I'm saying that they're saying things that should not be said. Okay, here's one who said that statement too. Perhaps you've already heard this before, in the sense of the 'don't spread your pearls to the wine. Have you ever heard that phrase?

**Speaker B:** I don't think so. I— maybe you have mentioned it before.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, this is one— this is a quote from Jesus.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, but what I'm saying is maybe you mentioned it in some of your videos, but I don't know that I've ever heard it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is a point of wisdom that you don't spread your pearls to the swine. You don't advertise or brag about what attainments that you've had. This is something that's just not done within the Sangha. Only people who have weird experiences, perhaps because they've read some books and now they feel really good, and then they'll go out and say that. And there's a number of people out there on the internet, and I've seen that, okay? But I would not normally trust anything that they have to say because they've got no foundation for it.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, what was your name? I'm not saying that they're wrong. I'm saying that they're not worthy of being trusted.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And what about discernment, Dhammarato, when you're—.

**Speaker A:** This is exactly what I'm talking about. This is exactly what I'm talking about, to have the discernment to recognize that many of these people that are on the internet have no foundation for what they're claiming, okay? And therefore it's automatically suspicious, okay?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but does— when you're mindfully breathing in and you're mindfully breathing out Does discerning things— what does that mean? Discerning how you're feeling?

**Speaker A:** Discerning— okay, are you thinking— what are you thinking about? What are you in this moment thinking about? Are you thinking about what some dude said on the YouTube? Is that what you're thinking about? If so, recognize that you can think of something better than that. You think about how nice it is right now. How this deep breath that we're taking in this moment feels really good. That's the discernment. The discernment is, is this thought a happy, wholesome, healthy thought? Or is this a thought of attainments and jealousies and bragging and all of that kind of stuff? That's the difference, the discernment. What are you thinking about? Are you thinking about something right now, or are you thinking about something that you heard last week or last month or yesterday?

**Speaker B:** Okay, and also you can do that with feelings. How you're feeling right now as well, right?

**Speaker A:** Right now, precisely. How are you feeling right now? And normally how we're feeling right now is the way that we were feeling because of what we were thinking about, which something said last week or last month. So because I've been thinking about what was happening last week or last month, I'm feeling the way that I felt last week and last month until I wake up to that and says, hey, I don't have to feel the way that I felt last week, last month, when I was listening to something that I didn't understand. I can shove all of this stuff aside and come into this present moment and be here now. Take a deep breath, says, wow, I'm glad I don't have to think about that stuff. I'm glad I don't have to remember that video. I can just be happy right now. Wow, that guy was claiming to be something special, then I wanted to be that special, and now I recognize that I don't have to be anything other than satisfied with this present moment. Ah, what a relief that is.

**Speaker B:** But when you're doing that, Dhammarato, from my experience, it doesn't happen straight away. It takes quite a while of talking to yourself before you start.

**Speaker A:** You have to keep remembering it, right? That's what the repetition is, over and over and over and over and over and over again. Anicca is like that. One note does not make music.

**Speaker B:** For me, I didn't take your teaching literally enough at the start because it is simply talking yourself into feeling good. But you need to— it's like having a conversation with yourself all day, in my experience.

**Speaker A:** Having a conversation, let's not say with who it is, but myself. Having a conversation, that's right. Having a wholesome, healthy conversation inside rather than having an unwholesome, unhealthy conversation inside.

**Speaker B:** And you know what I noticed once or twice as well, that I didn't even realize it, I wasn't that conscious of it, but all of a sudden I seen, oh Jesus, I'm actually talking to myself wholesomely. I kind of forgot that I was talking to myself wholesomely, but when I looked at it, I was like, I could see that I was talking to myself in a wholesome way. Like, it was kind of on a subconscious, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Well, do you know what the difference between conscious and subconscious is? No. Well, the difference between conscious and subconscious is that when one, you're asleep, and the other, and you're awake. That's why it's sub. It's subconscious because you're the one who is sub in the sense that your conscious is not up to what's really going on. That's what Sati is all about, is to wake up and start looking at what's going on. Don't be subconscious, be conscious. Wake up, wake up to these thoughts. Recognize what you're thinking. Recognize and with discernment decide whether this thought is worth having or not. And probably it's not.

**Speaker B:** What's your definition, Dhammarato, of mindfulness? Because I've heard kind of different definitions.

**Speaker A:** I don't even know the definition of the word mindfulness. I do know that almost everybody who hears the word hears it in context of Buddhism and that the word doesn't exist outside of a brand new usage, which means it doesn't even have an established definition yet. Well, if you— by the time that Webster's or whoever gives a definition for it, that definition may begin to stick. But I would recommend that we not use the word at all.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, if I was looking for some help in that kind of direction, What would you give me other than just talk to yourself?

**Speaker A:** Sati is the Pali word. Sati is the Pali word. And the English words that I like to use is wakey wakey, wake up, look at what's going on, get into your senses rather than in your head. And when this happens in school— now wait a minute— when this happens in school, the child that is not paying attention to the teacher and his mind has wandered away, perhaps he's looking out the window or something right there, and the teacher looks at that child and says, "Wake up and pay attention!" Or they may say, "Stop daydreaming!" That daydreaming is what we're talking about. That's the subconscious, is letting the mind wander and daydreaming. Because we're not paying attention to what we're thinking about. Discernment is to wake up and look and judge this. Is this daydream worth having or not? And almost always the answer is, well, we could make some improvements here and there. So that's a daydream.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's something.

**Speaker A:** Let's come out of the daydream. Let's come out of that daydream. Let's stop being subconscious. Let's start being conscious. Let's wake up so that we can see what's going on.

**Speaker B:** What about the word peripheral awareness? Have you heard of that one?

**Speaker A:** What's that word?

**Speaker B:** Peripheral awareness?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's being in your senses. You are aware of what's surrounding you. In fact, you are what's surrounding you. You're in a soup, you're in a stew, and there's all kinds of stuff rubbing up against you. There's all kinds of odors in the air. There's all kinds of things happening. Anagami. You can experience things like barometric pressure and changes of temperature and the wind and the touch of the cloth, that in fact most of the day you walk around in the clothes that you're wearing and you're not even aware of the touch of the cloth of those clothes. But when you're sitting in meditation, you will intentionally pay attention to the touch of the cloth. Because we're now looking at the breathing and the sensations of the breathing. So you were subconscious to all of the touch and the weight of the cloth of the clothing that you're wearing, but when you sit down for practicing Anapanasati, we begin to subtly aware of that touch of the clothing. All day long we go around subconscious to it, we don't even know it's there. We're not paying any attention to it at all. But you can. Guess what? We also go around all day wearing a kind of a suit of thoughts, the daydream that we're in. We're not paying attention to that daydream until we sit down, Prajna, Anapanasati, and then we start waking up to it. And we also wear a suit of feelings that are associated with those thoughts. And we don't wake up to that. People will say, "Oh, well, when I sit down to meditate, I can feel that anxiety," rather than, "Hey, I can dispel the anxiety when I'm sitting in meditation." But the reality is that they've already gotten uptight before they sat down in meditation, but they don't even know it. So we wear all kinds of clothing subconsciously. We're not aware of the feelings, we're not aware of the thoughts, we're not aware of the deep longing that we have, or any of that kind of stuff. And so Anapanasati is beginning to pay attention to how we feel and what we're thinking and what the body is doing. What's the experience of it? This is the issue of the periphery. The question is, what's the core? The answer to that is, we don't know because the core keeps moving. All there is, is periphery. Let's pay attention to the periphery, because that's what's in motion.

**Speaker B:** I know you speak about— and I'm sorry for saying that again, you told me to stop saying that— I didn't.

**Speaker A:** Say to stop it, I said denote it. We'll get into what's needed to be stopped soon enough.

**Speaker B:** You're advising to only meditate for 10 minutes a day, 6, 10 minutes, 6 times a day. But when I have my, when I have my best meditations and when I can make my mind the most wholesome, it's after about 45 minutes of meditation. Uh, but no, I don't do that. Just watch.

**Speaker A:** What a waste of time. What are you doing for that 45 minutes? I don't know, but that's not actually practicing meditation immediately. Sit down with the full intention that you're going to watch the thoughts and that you're going to modify the thoughts and that you're going to put yourself into a really good state. And do that within a couple, 3, 5 breaths.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, it takes me about 45 minutes before I can really say, wow, I really feel good right now.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is that it doesn't take that long. So if you have to, do it in 35, then do it in 30, then do it in 25, then do it in 20, then do it in 15, then do it in 10. This may take you 6, 8, 10 weeks to do it like that if you want to. Or you can go from 45 down to 20 this week. Then you can go from 20 down to 10 next week. Up to you, depends upon your attitude. The attitude that you want to have is, I can do this, I can feel good right now. I can take a deep breath and just relax. Say, wow, it feels good. Just, just let it all go. Why do you have to sit 45 minutes before you do that? Why can't you do that within 5 seconds?

**Speaker B:** Well, I try.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is that this is not a trying kind of effort. This is a different kind of effort. The effort is, first off, is to remember and be glad that you can see this stuff. Become glad, happy, that you can in fact see what's going on in your own mind. It's almost like the sewer repairman after a certain amount of time, comes pulling his hands out of the sewer with a great big dead rat. And the, uh, the sewer mechanic man is really, really happy that he's found this great big dead rat. Why? Because that's what he was looking for, and he found it. And now he doesn't have to dig in the sewer anymore because sewer works properly because he got that dead rat out. Okay, and we can do that with every thought that we have. This is dead rat, throw that turkey out, we got him! I see that dead rat, throw him out, and now I can just— everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** So, um, I see, I have, I heard Dhammarato, you're living in an island off the coast of Thailand. How did you end up in a little island?

**Speaker A:** By wisdom, by choice, by investigation.

**Speaker B:** And were you— you were obviously on the mainland before that, were you?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Were you on the mainland of Thailand before you moved to the island? Were you living.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And do you help out any locals there on the island like you help us out, like with your teachings?

**Speaker A:** I don't understand your question.

**Speaker B:** Is there people, locals where you're living, do you teach them like you teach?

**Speaker A:** I teach about 12,000 on the island here. Oh, do you mean do I have any schools? Students on the island.

**Speaker B:** Yes, students on the island.

**Speaker A:** Well, I— Tun is a permanent resident here of the island, and he's a student. And, um, Eric just arrived, then he went over to, uh, uh, Dhamma TM and found a senior monk that took him under his wing and took him back to Wat Suan Mokkh. So I'm very pleased about what's happening with Eric right now.

**Speaker B:** That Eric is— Eric is one of the guys who often calls into the group chat, is it? On Skype?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Eric Zonker, he said yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, brilliant, that's excellent. Yeah, cool. Um, deadly, that's good stuff to hear. Fair play to them.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I've had many students, but we haven't had any students because of COVID because the Thai government was very strict about COVID including the fact that there were no planes. I mean, that's how strict as they've been for quite a while. But then they wanted a 2-week quarantine, which nobody wants to do.

**Speaker B:** Do you do anything, Dhammarato, that you— no, I know you obviously enjoy teaching the Dhamma and that, but would you ever, the likes of yourself, do you have any hobbies or anything?

**Speaker A:** Actually, I've got a hobby, and it is, let us say, Very, very high-tech, 20 years ago.

**Speaker B:** I think I heard you say— A.

**Speaker A:** Lot of high-tech today.

**Speaker B:** Movies, you watch movies or something, and.

**Speaker A:** There'S— I have, right, right. I have literally dozens and dozens of hard drives, most of them quite massive. And when I say a massive hard drive, that means that it will contain up to about 10,000 movies, and I've got about 20 of them. So we're talking about 200,000 movies. Now, how do I manage all of those? Well, I have 3 servers. Actually, I've got 6, but I've got 3 of them permanently offline because they're not fast enough anymore. They're too old of technology, but the hard drives are still good. Um, but, uh, actually two of them are down. Two of the three servers are down right now, but I keep one of them up all the time to gather movies. I also have another server that runs a cloud. And the cloud that it runs is these 20-something 8 terabyte drives.

**Speaker B:** I don't know what that means, but anyway.

**Speaker A:** Well, megabyte, gigabyte, and terabyte. So, uh, a mega— a megabyte is 1 millionth of a terabyte, more or less 1 millionth. It's actually because it's binarity, even Anagami. You.

**Speaker B:** Like watching movies, so— No, I don't watch movies.

**Speaker A:** I'm not a movie watcher. If I was only a movie watcher, I'd just watch them online. Well, not the movies, the good ones. They don't put those online. The top movies of this year we get off the internet. But I'm not, I don't get them to watch them. I don't watch movies often. Probably one a month or something like that.

**Speaker B:** And are you still, because you obviously ordained as a monk, are you still considered a monk that you live at a house.

**Speaker A:** With your family? Let us say it this way, that I don't wear the robes, and I don't live with other monks. However, there are a lot of fully ordained monks who don't do those two things. They don't live with other monks, and they don't always wear monk's clothes. But there is a disrobing ceremony that's done. It's quite formal and whatever like that. And so the last thing that I had done with them was that I took that disrobing ceremony. That's the proper and appropriate thing to do. It's a big ceremony, lots of people there.

**Speaker B:** And for someone like yourself, would you ever go for a beer or out to for a bite to eat in a restaurant or anything like that?

**Speaker A:** First off, I don't like beer. It doesn't taste good. Wine is not delicious things to drink. I do not understand, in fact, how people do get used to and start to like both the taste of alcohol and the effects of it.

**Speaker B:** So, what's the answer to the question?

**Speaker A:** Okay, well the answer to the question is, I would not go out with anyone for a beer, no matter what the invitation.

**Speaker B:** Would you not? No, no, but I'm just saying, even if you're in a restaurant with your wife, would you have a sip of wine or anything, or even?

**Speaker A:** Is that— Well, for one thing, the restaurants in Thailand don't sell alcohol.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right, okay.

**Speaker A:** But the second thing is, is that why should I go to a restaurant? Why should I do that? What's the point of going to a restaurant? Always restaurant food is more expensive than ordinary food, and it's generally not as good. My wife's a cook. She's the head cook in a well-known French restaurant here on the island.

**Speaker B:** Brilliant.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I get all the good food that I want.

**Speaker B:** Happy days.

**Speaker A:** What you want, I don't know, I don't care. I'm not interested. I don't go and think about a food and then want to eat it and then go to a restaurant to have it. I don't have those kind of thoughts.

**Speaker B:** That's no problem. Well, look, it's nearly time for me. This place is gonna start getting a bit busier there now. But if you're speaking to Eric, give him my regards and tell him he might come online sometime and let us know how he's getting on.

**Speaker A:** Actually, his computer is left here at the house, and he took his cell phone. But at Wat Suwan Mok area, he probably will not have much opportunity there. It's out in the wilderness, and cell phone signals are not good there.

**Speaker B:** So just quickly before I go, what kind of stuff would he be doing now, Dhammarato? Would he be just left on his own to meditate?

**Speaker A:** He would be learning to do nothing. And be satisfied with doing nothing. What's there to do? Why do you— why are you so busy is the way to answer it. I asked the question, but you asked that, not me. You ask yourself, why are you so busy? What is it that you keep wanting over and over again? You keep doing things over and over again. Why can't you just sit down and just be relaxed and happy and content in the moment? Not wanting anything. Well, that's what you can practice, just sitting with and enjoying that 45 minutes rather than getting yourself into a state for 45 minutes so that now you can enjoy 1 minute. Why don't you enjoy the whole 45? Just sitting there doing nothing.

**Speaker B:** I'll try. I do, I do enjoy Morse, but I love it.

**Speaker A:** All right, now that's the difference between 'I'll try' sounds like a failure, but now you're saying, 'But you can do it, and I know that you can do it. You have been doing it, keep doing it.' And whenever you catch yourself not doing it, do it. And I have many people, when they catch themselves not doing it, they fuss at themselves for not doing it, which is just more unwholesome thoughts. When you see an unwholesome thought, change it to a wholesome thought, not fuss at yourself for having unwholesome thoughts. Fussing at yourself for having unwholesome thoughts is even more unwholesome than having unwholesome thoughts. Congratulate yourself for seeing that unwholesome thought and say, "Yeah, I caught that dead rat!" Then you've changed your attitude and your mood, and now you can set that dead rat down and just enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** That's no problem, Big D, and hopefully I'll be in touch again. Thanks very much for taking my call.

**Speaker A:** Dean, enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** I will, I will.

**Speaker A:** Just enjoy the moment. Everything is right, right now. Everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Cool, thank you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the key Dhamma points discussed in the talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Themes of the Talk:**

1.  **Sense Restraint (Indriya Saṁvara):** The talk begins by clarifying the Buddha's teaching on guarding the sense doors. It's not about shutting down perception or becoming unaware of your surroundings. Instead, it's about **wise attention**—consciously choosing what to look at or listen to, avoiding unwholesome inputs, and using the senses purposefully (e.g., a monk looking at the path to walk safely, not to "gawk"). The warning is against misinterpreting this as a rigid, repressive practice.

2.  **Virtue (Sīla) Redefined:** The discussion moves away from a Western, rule-based notion of virtue as "good behavior." Instead, Dhammarato defines it through the lens of **dukkha (suffering/stress)**. Virtuous action is that which avoids creating or transmitting dukkha through body, speech, or mind. A selfish mind state is itself dukkha and leads to actions that spread dukkha to others.

3.  **Enduring vs. Uprooting Suffering:** The difference between managing and uprooting unwholesome states is explained through analogies:
    *   **Enduring:** Sometimes necessary for external situations that cannot be changed (like healing a broken arm), akin to the Serenity Prayer. The goal is to develop **upekkhā (equanimity)**—not just enduring, but finding peace with what cannot be changed.
    *   **Uprooting/Managing:** For mental defilements, the preferred method is not a grand "root hunt" but the persistent **"whacking" of weeds**—continuously abandoning unwholesome thoughts the moment they arise (as in Ānāpānasati). Through constant denial of nourishment, the underlying tendencies wither away.

4.  **Practical Meditation & Mindfulness:** The core instruction is **"wake up" (Sati)** to your present-moment experience.
    *   **Discernment (Paññā):** Use it to evaluate your current thoughts and feelings. Ask: "Is this thought wholesome? Does it lead to peace or stress?" Then, consciously choose wholesome thoughts.
    *   **Technique:** It's framed as a continuous, friendly **internal conversation** where you "talk yourself into" a good, relaxed state. The goal is to be able to cultivate well-being **quickly** (in a few breaths), not through long, arduous sessions. Short, frequent practice (e.g., 10 minutes, 6x/day) is encouraged.
    *   **Key Attitude:** When you notice an unwholesome thought, **congratulate yourself for catching it** (like finding a "dead rat" in a sewer), then gently let it go. Do not berate yourself for having it, as that adds more unwholesome mental chatter.

5.  **Warnings on Attainment Talk:** Dhammarato cautions against being overly concerned with or trusting public claims about deep attainments (like jhānas or stream-entry). He notes that within the traditional Sangha, such attainments are not advertised, as public discussion can lead to jealousy, misunderstanding, and distraction from the core work of watching the present mind.

### **Overall Tone & Method:**
The teaching is pragmatic, down-to-earth, and focused on immediate application. Dhammarato consistently redirects the questioner from abstract concepts ("What is virtue?") or speculative topics ("What about fourth jhana?") back to the **direct investigation of one's present-moment mind and feelings.** The ultimate aim is to learn to "do nothing" — to be content, relaxed, and free from wanting in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate his points about Buddhist practice, sense restraint, and dealing with suffering. Here are the main ones:

**1. The Puppy with a Ball (Misapplied Sense Restraint)**
*   **Metaphor:** Someone who misunderstands the teaching on sense restraint is like a puppy that grabs a ball and runs all over the yard with it.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how people can take a teaching (guarding the senses) to an extreme, wrong conclusion (shutting down the senses entirely) instead of understanding its balanced intent (paying wise attention).

**2. The Monk Walking (Proper Sense Restraint)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:** The Buddha instructed monks to keep their gaze focused about two bow-lengths ahead while walking.
*   **Purpose:** To exemplify correct sense restraint: the eyes are used attentively and purposefully (to walk safely and avoid obstacles) rather than being shut down or allowed to wander and grasp at enticing sights.

**3. The Child with a Broken Arm (Enduring Suffering)**
*   **Story:** A child with a broken arm must endure the itch and discomfort of the cast to allow the arm to heal. Some doctors even cast the hand to prevent movement that would disturb the healing.
*   **Purpose:** To explain the wise form of endurance—accepting short-term discomfort for long-term healing, and the importance of fully immobilizing (restraining) the source of the problem.

**4. The AA Serenity Prayer (Wisdom in Endurance)**
*   **Reference:** He cites the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer: "Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."
*   **Purpose:** To frame the discussion on endurance (*Upekkha*)—distinguishing between what should be endured (unchangeable external conditions) and what should be changed (one's internal reaction).

**5. The Doctor and the Brahma Viharas (Equanimity)**
*   **Extended Metaphor:** A medical doctor embodies the four "divine abodes" (*Brahma Viharas*): friendliness (*Metta*), compassion (*Karuna*), sympathetic joy (*Mudita*), and equanimity (*Upekkha*). The doctor must use *Upekkha* to accept that every patient will eventually die, preventing burnout and allowing them to continue helping others joyfully.
*   **Purpose:** To teach that equanimity isn't cold detachment, but the wise ability to engage compassionately without being crushed by things beyond your control (like death or dysfunctional politics).

**6. The Swamp of Politics / The Crocodile**
*   **Metaphor:** Trying to fix government is like trying to drain a swamp. Those who try often end up "becoming one of the crocodiles in the very pond they wanted to drain."
*   **Purpose:** To advise wise sense restraint (staying away from futile, corrupting external struggles) and to cultivate internal peace instead of dissatisfaction with unfixable external systems.

**7. Weeding the Garden (Uprooting vs. Managing Defilements)**
*   **Extended Metaphor:** Unwholesome thoughts are like weeds.
    *   **"Uprooting" (Mahayana-style, in his description):** Digging deep to pull out the root, which can be disruptive (like breaking concrete).
    *   **"Managing" (Anapanasati-style):** Repeatedly "whacking off" the weed (the unwholesome thought) every time it sprouts. Without nourishment, the root eventually dies.
*   **Purpose:** To advocate for the moment-to-moment practice of recognizing and abandoning unwholesome thoughts as they arise, rather than an obsessive, introspective "root hunt."

**8. The Sewer Repairman and the Dead Rat**
*   **Metaphor:** The meditator spotting an unwholesome thought is like a sewer repairman who finds a big dead rat clogging the pipe. He should be **happy** he found it, remove it, and then enjoy the clear-flowing sewer.
*   **Purpose:** To encourage a positive, celebratory attitude when noticing negative thoughts. The correct response is not self-criticism ("I'm bad for having this thought") but joyful discernment ("Great! I caught that 'dead rat' and can now throw it out!").

**9. The Suit of Thoughts / Clothing**
*   **Metaphor:** We wear a "suit of thoughts" and a "suit of feelings" all day, much like the physical clothing on our body. We are usually subconscious to these mental "clothes."
*   **Purpose:** To explain how meditation (*Anapanasati*) is the process of "waking up" and becoming aware of these ever-present but unnoticed thought and feeling patterns (the "periphery" of our experience).

**10. The Student Needing 45 Minutes to Meditate**
*   **Implied Metaphor/Story:** The student's long meditation to feel good is contrasted with the possibility of achieving that state in a few breaths. This becomes a story-in-the-moment about training attitude.
*   **Purpose:** To challenge the idea that peace requires long struggle. He advises "training down" the time—from 45 minutes, to 20, to 10, to 5 seconds—to cultivate the immediate ability to "let it all go" and be happy now. The effort is one of joyful remembering, not grim striving.

These metaphors and stories are central to the speaker's teaching style, making abstract Buddhist concepts like sense restraint, equanimity, and right effort concrete, memorable, and practical.
