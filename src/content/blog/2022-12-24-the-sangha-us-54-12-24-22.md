### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome to the Friday evening talk. I think that Christmas is on Sunday this year, right? So we're coming right up to it within the next few hours or so, um, and so I'm really surprised to see so many of you here today. And we've been enjoying the moment for a while, and then it stumbled across the idea that, you know, everyone is racist. It's part of our nature. It has to do with instinct. In fact, the instinct would be the territorial instinct, that you see that in many, many animals. That in fact, one example that's very, very interesting is that they reintroduced wolves into Yellowstone and that they put radio collars on quite a few of them and started to track. And what they found out was, is that these wolves collected themselves into tribes and that they had natural boundaries or natural borders between the tribalism. And it only took them one generation to set that stuff up. And that was kind of amazing, that that's how deeply territorial we are, that in fact the territory, that instinct is very close to the issue of what we would call ownership or control, the instinct of this is mine, I own this, okay, so this is my place. Go ahead, David.

**Speaker B:** That's rooted in survival though, ultimately.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** What's fascinating, like most of the things we condemn as shadow fundamentally are disassociated instinctual intelligence, fundamentally. And it's like we believe we have to castrate these things. There's a great quote by Jung actually that says, "I would rather be whole than be good." And I think fundamentally that means that goodness, as he's kind of responding to Nietzsche, is a phenomenon based on cultural identity and it changes all the time. Whole, integrated whole is the Dharmakaya. It is the way of being. It is the wholeness. It is Gautama under the tree, unifying neither towards nor away any further, like total unification. And like, it's not to condemn tribalism. To incorporate tribalism into a larger sense of tribe, right? You don't remove an instinct.

**Speaker A:** You don't remove— You expand the borders. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's Jung as well. You create yourself. You do not limit. You do not come in. You get greater. You get larger. Hold the darkness as well than just staying in the little light, right?

**Speaker C:** You're talking very good Dhamma, David.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's good. Right. Okay. That means then that the self-preservation instinct is the basic instinct.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And that the other instincts follow along in support of that. Now, one of the things that we get messed up with in our culture is the procreation instinct, because we immediately go to sex. But in fact, that's just one of the many kinds of procreation that we do. We make things, we have concepts and ideas, and that the mind is the forerunner to all things. The example that I use is that the first car was an idea.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Gautama says, "From all things proceed from mind, from the mind all things proceed," or come, right? One of the Dhammapada. All— yeah, and that's where ideology and philosophy— our time is a war of philosophy. It's a war of meaning, first within our own relationship to reality, fundamentally, right?

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Well, 2,500 or 2,650 years ago, I mean, the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So there are four basic instincts. The procreation instinct is number two. Number one, the big deal is self-preservation. Now, I would say that that could be better stated as organism preservation instinct, that is trying to keep the organism alive. And the basic communication of that is fear, that if we did not have fear, we would have been dead long ago. We would have walked into the principal's office and hit him, or we would have done something really stupid, we would have walked into the road, we would have jumped off a cliff, we would have done anything like that if we were completely fearless. And yet, fear winds up being the number one problem that we have in the world, and we manipulate each other through propaganda to make people afraid.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, it impacts us. [Speaker:Rick] But it's not the seeker that's the problem. It's not libido that's the problem, it's not violence that's the problem, it's the disuse or misuse of these qualities, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** The neglected child of our own souls that then screams back at us and says, "Where am I? Where are you?" And then we become afraid of fear. If you go into some communities, there's afraid of aggression. It becomes so pacified that if you were to go into the wild, you'd be dead in a day.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker B:** I mean, that cannot be the way of being. That cannot be the highest Dharma.

**Speaker C:** And we can see that even in superficial conversations. If you look at psychiatric students, something like this, perhaps they'll tell each other, oh, your aggression is so well sublimated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're like, basically you push it all into this weird, like.

**Speaker C:** Freudian Instead of integration, they look to chop, like you're saying. And we can chop and chop and chop and chop, and it can be helpful along the way. But just like we saw with what you were saying about violence, when they reintroduced those wolves in Yellowstone, one of the things that they noticed is that the shores of the waters that ran through there started to hold together better. And this is because wolves, they didn't sublimate aggression. Instead, they took proper action to do their jobs as part of the system that they were integrated within again. When they were taken out, they would eat too much from the shores, and these soils would become loose. It wouldn't be able to hold. And yet when the wolves were reintroduced, they did their thing, and those little geoengineers, those little beautiful bastards, they went about eating and doing what they needed to do to help, you know, whatever. And what we were doing, we thought by killing them all, bam, bam, bam, that we were doing something that was helpful for us, which for a time it was. But this is one of the ways in which we see that we all inter-be. Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** I mean, the river regained its original shape. It actually changed course, right? And so then it's almost, you know, as the Christian, the Bible would say, what is without, so too within. And like, you can then see that even the qualities of being, the ultimate dharmakaya of reality, require the violence to sustain the river herself. I mean, fuck, that is like— if.

**Speaker C:** That doesn't blow you out, I don't know what would.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I was in a retreat once, and I was, you know, doing a lot of meditation, and there was this moment where I began to be like, oh my God, the Dharma is quite literally speaking from every single angle if you just perceive it the right way. And it was all— I mean, it felt psychedelic to the point where This cascade of meaning is falling off of a single blade of grass or of a snake moving through, as Thich Nhat Hanh beautifully— well, I'm not going to quote him, but the point being is like you can look at everything and see that interbeing, that dependent origination, and that fundamental, even archetypal aspect of all qualities moving through the fabric of this existence. I mean, the wolves, that's one of the most eloquent examples of the need to reintegrate the disassociated qualities of mind. That is like, if you can't see that, if Nietzsche didn't kind of prove his point in that one moment, like— How beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much, David.

**Speaker C:** That was so beautiful to share with you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad I answered the phone. This is cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Ah, excellent. And this is what I want to see promoted too, is this sort of Sangha of people getting together and understanding that you're not alone in the world, that we've And so, right, there's something very interesting. Not just something. This whole topic of instincts is extraordinarily powerful because it describes human behavior. But all animals, especially mammals, but not just mammals, ducks and geese and fish and everything, has these four instincts. Okay, and so we've talked about two of them just a bit. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about the procreation instinct as materialism, wanting to own and control things. That the example that I use is once, way, way back when, this guy was getting the marrow out of the bone of some big carcass that the wolves had finished. Couldn't get it, and he picked up a rock. And this particular rock had a kind of an edge to it, so it made the bones break easy. Well, otters use stones. They will go and get a clam at the bottom and a stone, and then they'll go to the surface and swim on their back and then use that stone to break open the clam. But what does the otter always do with the stone after he gets the thing open? He just drops it. So what made us human is the fact that someplace along the line somebody picked up a rock and he thought it was a nice rock, it did the job, and he kept it. Oh, maybe a generation or so later somebody wrapped twine and a stick around it, and now we've got the first hand axe.

**Speaker C:** And that's it.

**Speaker A:** And we use those things for protection and for tools. That in fact there's very little distinction between a tool and a weapon, because we use them for the same thing. We use it for making our life better and for self-protection. That in fact, that original stone that we're talking about is now the modern-day cell phone. Yeah, it used to be a gun. Before that, it was a dagger or a knife or a sword, and very few people went around without being armed. That in fact the Sikhs, part of their religion is you've got to have a particular kind of dagger with you.

**Speaker C:** I saw the other day a small snippet in a cartoon that I like to watch sometimes, and I swear, you know, I never know where they get these things from, but it sure does come back around. It said something along the lines of, you know, it's really great that we do all these things, but as soon as a being is able to extract enough sugar from something using a machine to give itself diabetes, it needs to start looking beyond conflict.

**Speaker A:** You know.

**Speaker C:** And I thought that was a very interesting idea with what Dhammarato was talking about with the weapons and such too, because for a long time that was needed in order to get to where we are.

**Speaker A:** But even that's because it was a widespread belief. Yeah, if everybody had the belief this is a safe place and we can get along together, then there would have been no need for the knives. It was the fact that it was mass area that other people are dangerous.

**Speaker B:** But, but just like, just like the world. Because. Because also similarly, like within, within mammalian and well, I mean, not even just mammalian, there are violent conflicts and. And rights of land. And so that that instinct transcends into consciousness itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker C:** And we see people talk about this when they talk about the development of the human throughout evolutionary psychology, when they use the term self Domestication.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker C:** I used to be like a tiger as a young boy, and I think someone else said something about it, you know. Now I'm a house cat.

**Speaker B:** And wait, say that again. I missed what you just said.

**Speaker C:** I said I used to be like a tiger when I was younger, and now I am much more like a house cat, and I much prefer to be more like a house cat.

**Speaker B:** We are animals that can no longer, for the most of us, walk barefoot upon the earth. I had a moment, it was one of the most religious moments of my life. I was riding a motor— I was.

**Speaker A:** In this— okay, I'm not riding a motorcycle barefoot.

**Speaker B:** Other than that, I crossed this mountain peak, a pass on the Tibetan Plateau actually, and as I crested, this pack of 4 wolves walked over at the same time. And I kid you not, we were less than 20 feet from each other, and they looked at my eyes. I could see the color— well, they were blackish, but I could see like straight into their fucking pupils. And this animal had been so hardened and perfected by its environment. There was no coddling. There was no pug in it at all. All of that was a nightmare to the dogs that came from them 10,000 years before. And like, these beings were as close to something holy as I had ever seen. And they moved on. They looked at me and I wasn't afraid. They didn't give any territorial kind of stances. But they never single broke a stride, never broke a single stride. And they just looked. Kind of like amused almost, and just kept walking or kind of trotting up this mountain that must have reached at its peak like 18,000, 19,000 feet. And they're just going up, and there's these little farming villages where yak and yak will graze, and they'll hunt them, they'll take down these animals. And just seeing this being in like 0 Celsius on a mountaintop walking far higher up without ever slowing down, no hint of exhaustion. And I'm looking at it, and it was like everything that had been tamed in me realized had been a slight small sin to a degree. I had given up something, I had forgotten something. Not that we should be worrying— connecting to nature.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like, like, you're connected to nature. Yeah, like, I think a lot of times you can see enlightenment in a lot of animals and even babies because they haven't like developed the critical thinking interpretation mechanisms to separate themselves out from reality as an individual entity.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker D:** So they're like constantly— they don't really have the ability to mentally proliferate. So like, which makes them enlightened to an extent, but like humans are kind of different because a human has the ability to mentally proliferate and discern reality and discern the nature of reality itself and the rules by which it operates. But they also have the capacity to return to the non— the no-mind of not mentally proliferating about any of it. And just being it. Like, this is it. It's like you're saying about with the Dhammakaya before. If you think there's any difference between spiritual and physical meditation and not meditation, you're still in an illusion because all of it is the Dhamma. There's nothing else.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah. But you know, there have been, um, there's a, um, Several times in history, one would be Tarzan. Romulus and Remus are two other examples of where human beings were not raised by human beings. They were raised by animals. And they became much more natural.

**Speaker D:** Return to monkey. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** We— yeah, this human baby was born an ape and stayed an ape. It didn't get socialized.

**Speaker B:** Well, I just want to add, I'm not saying that like to return— okay, there's a great quote by Hermann Hesse that goes something like, it is not back to the child nor back to the wolf. It is deeper still, further yet into sin. It is deeper back into the human complexity that we then find God. And I'm not trying to say that we should go back.

**Speaker D:** Actually, it's not that deep.

**Speaker B:** What? What I was just going to say.

**Speaker D:** It'S more about like lightening up. Like, the deeper you're going, the more confusing it's getting.

**Speaker B:** I was just going to say, I'm not saying that the wolf was enlightened. I was saying that its complete perfection of the environment had coddled it in no way, so it was hardened. But in Buddhist philosophy, it is only through the human life that one can actually enlighten. And so it's like, it's not the kind of born-into non-dualism It's the return back, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. So what you're actually saying— yeah, I.

**Speaker C:** Hear Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it. He says when you're a young, young child and your mama has you cradled and the little dog comes over and she kicks at the dog, this is the moment, this is the first hindrance, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly so.

**Speaker C:** Then the child walks around and stubs his toe and says, ah, and kicks the chair thinking the chair is separate and can have a self, you know. And then this goes on forever and ever and ever and ever until one day we either hit our head hard enough and something physically changes and we go, oh fuck, this is it. Or sit long enough and we go, oh, this is it. And I like the second one better, you know, because then I don't have to have a rock in my head.

**Speaker A:** All right, we can sum up then We can sum up what we're saying here. Go, sorry.

**Speaker D:** No, go for it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we can, we can, we can sum this up then by saying that humans, as well as all the other animals, have a whole lot of equipment we are born with, that programming of instincts. And what human society has done is warp our instincts, layering them, using them, misusing them. And the example that I would use is the nesting instinct or the herding instinct, because that keeps us safe if we have a nest to sleep in. But then there are nest rules, there are house rules. And our society has so misused that one that we wind up, every one of us, doing what we're told to do. Without knowing it. We just go along to get along because we're social. That nesting instinct is that social system that we have, and we just go ahead and just do what we're told to do, and then we resent it. And we do it sometimes or do it poorly.

**Speaker C:** Isolation.

**Speaker A:** And so one of the most important qualities of the Dhamma then is to understand that the Buddha had these things to these four basic instincts. Can they've got analogies to them? And one of them is the four modes of clinging. Now, originally, people will think that all that means that the instincts are bad. No, it's that we cling in four ways according to the misuse of these instincts. And one of them is, is that humans go around being afraid. Of things that there is no fear inherently in, but it once did, so we remember it from the past and we're socialized into seeing things as dangerous, where in fact they're not. Another thing that humans do with the territorial instinct is we start using concepts and ideas and belief systems and things like that as our territory. Okay, yes, Scott.

**Speaker D:** I was going to ask the question about the underlying tendency for craving for being, and then the one— Look at.

**Speaker A:** That, the Buddha knew that the underlying tendency, the instinct of craving for being, the self-preservation instinct. I mean, listen to that. The Buddha knew about this stuff scientifically 2,500 years ago. Go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker D:** So I wanted to say that, like, yeah, like once you realize that the let go of the underlying or change or transcend or whatever you want to call it, the underlying tendency for craving for being, which is essentially is the animal instinct to the fear of death at the end of it. Just the fear of, of this body dying. And then, so like, that's why the Buddha always took people to the charnel grounds and showed them dead corpses and said, hey, look at those, this body will be like that too. So once you let go of the craving for being, the craving for birth, the craving for being somebody like a person, being alive, then that leads to the realization of non-being, or the cessation, or the Nirodha. And then once you experience that, it's so profoundly good that you crave for that too. So the next underlying thing is the craving for non-being. Because so a Buddha goes the middle way. He doesn't crave to not exist. Or he doesn't crave to exist either. So it's like, it's like he's like escaped the cycle of it all, the cycle of birth and death. That's what, that's what that means by the wheel of Samsara. It's like coming into existence and coming out of it. Once you let go of both of that, you see the divine in the mundane, or the emptiness in the form, and the form out of the emptiness. Like it's all the Dhammakaya, like it's the one reality.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let's expand upon that, Scott. Wherever we are, if we want to leave that place and go someplace else, there's both a death and a birth involved with that. We are dying to the place that we are in when we leave it, and when we go someplace else, then That's a new birth. And so we go through that life-death cycle that is the big deal at the bottom of the instincts. Actually, we play that out with every time that we move around. We play that out. Okay. And you can see, in fact, there's an old Jimmy Durante song. That the Coneheads did when they were about to go back to their original planet. Okay, have you ever had the feeling that you wanted to go, you wanted to go, and you wanted to stay, stay, go, go, stay? Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do. I go, I stay. Now that's really, really profound. I mean, it's a silly little song, but when we recognize that, we recognize that We do sometimes have bad feelings over, am I leaving? Am I going? I mean, this is all about the rituals of goodbyes and hellos. Yeah. And we have those rituals. In fact, this— it happens from time to time when somebody's cell phone cuts off and they're gone from the talk, and then they have bad feelings because he didn't go through the goodbye ritual that we were, you know, killed. Instantly, unnecessarily, by a dead battery. And so, we can actually see then, that the four modes of clinging that the Buddha was talking about, were rediscovered by science in the form of these instincts, and that they call them underlying tendencies, and these are the four modes of clinging, that if we cling in that way, we wind up in one of those woeful states. Like hell. And the one that we use the most is that woeful animal. We're all born as an animal. And what do we mean in that? It doesn't mean a worm or an insect or a snake or whatever. We're talking about the animals that were draft animals— elephants and horses and domesticated animals. Why? Because we humans use an animal to do what we want to do with unconcern for the horse. So I've got two examples. One, I saw this in India, a donkey that was tied on his back to a pole that ground, that had a grinding wheel on it. And this donkey was around this path and the owner was putting the sugarcane in and making sugarcane juice and selling it out on the street. Guess how much of that sugarcane juice that donkey got? Not much. He might have gotten the husk, and that might have been enough.

**Speaker C:** But him, it might have been— he might have just been playing his position, huh?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he might have been. Uh, but the donkey didn't look too happy to me when I was there with him. Here's another example that the, the horse is in the pasture with all kinds of pastoral foods to eat. And the pasture and the horse are bought by a new guy, and he puts a harness and a plow on that horse and makes the horse plow up his own pasture.

**Speaker B:** That is an amazing symbol. Wow. Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah. Yes. So that's what we do in our lives. We are taught to do what we're told to do. You got to go get a job, you got to go do this, you got to go do that. We've got obligations, and all of that comes out of that being, you know, a dumb animal. And then humans are smart enough to recognize, wait a minute, I'm doing something and I don't like to do it. But then we make the mistake is I don't like to do it because he made me do it. My boss made me do this. Okay, now we— so we resent our job. Most work that's done in the world is make-do work, unnecessary work. An example of that is all they would have to do is change the tax laws in the United States and every accountant in the country is out of business. About half the courts get cleaned out. Actually make stuff to do that is completely unnecessary to do. Yeah, yeah. Yes, Scott.

**Speaker D:** Oh, I just wanted to give a testimonial of before I started practicing meditation as taught by Dhammarato. Um, I used to have like a problem with authority. Like, I would either be afraid of them or really angry, angry and resentful towards authority. So no matter who it is telling me what to do, or a boss, I would either be scared of getting their approval or I would like hate them on the inside. So I'd be like suffering on the inside. And then it wasn't until I realized like the the joy of the Dharma and like the power in it, like there's something powerful in it. When I started to realize like the transcendent peace and love that came all only from within and right in between my two ears, that destroyed all fear of authority. Now I just see them as my friends and I treat them like my friends. Yes, that whole— so that's My friends, thank you.

**Speaker A:** The reality is that every human being is a human being, period. That's all we have to do. But our society teaches, oh, this one's big, this one's little, this one's rich, this one's poor, this one's bad, this one's good. And we bring in all of these judgments about people that we're better than or less than, which is a comparison or a competition. We make our whole lives a competition for no reason at all. We don't have to compete with each other, or if we do, we can do it in a win-win situation to where everybody wins.

**Speaker C:** Everybody eats.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but we have a culture that's set up about winning and losing. Now, I can understand instinctually where that comes from, because in the old days, the winners had dinner and the losers were lunch. Yes, sir. But we don't live in that kind of society anymore. That we used to live in a jungle, it was dangerous. Now we have cities, but we call them concrete jungles because everybody there is still afraid.

**Speaker C:** And you know what's funny about that? When they have to be grouped in such a way, we hear phrases come out of those areas that are so beautiful, like we all we got. It is what it is. That's another great one. Oh, it's amazing, you know. Yeah, that phrase, when I see that phrase pop up, I love to see it because I recognize it as a quick reminder from whatever Bodhisattva dropped it there for me to just take a nice breath.

**Speaker D:** I was going to ask you, Dhammarato, can you talk about Samma Sanghappa, because we're talking about competition and winners and losers. But another thing that you— that I started training my mind to do is be a winner. So like, that's what you teach about Samma Sanghappa, if I understand that correctly. So it's like being a winner in your own mind is like number one thing to do because like from being a winner, you're going to be more compassionate to others because you're not competing with them. So it's like, let's say, oh, your girlfriend. Yeah, yeah. So let's say, oh, your girlfriend cheats on you, leaves you. You can in your mind think of yourself as a loser, or you can think, oh, well, she just filtered herself out of my life for me. And I need wholesome friends around me. So it's a blessing in disguise. So like you think about it in a way that makes you a winner. And then you feel like a winner. Okay. And that's so.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's look at two things then, or two different ways. Let's look at it from the ordinary position versus the noble position. Now, in a relationship, in an ordinary position, the winner is the one who leaves, who quits, and the loser is the one who lost something that they wanted. And so in that regard, uh, part of the, you know, tending to or going towards the noble— it's better to quit a job than to get fired, right? It's better to leave on your own rather than getting kicked out of whatever it is, because that really, really hurts our social, our nesting instinct. We don't like to get kicked out of the nest because it's dangerous. Okay.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the reality is many relationships are more dangerous than getting out of them. But we don't use the wisdom for that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now let's look at it from the perspective of the noble. And the noble that you were mentioning, Scott, is, is that we threw Anapanasati and getting our own internal success going. That will give us that attitude about how to deal with the rest of the people. That in fact, we deal with other people the way that we deal with ourselves on our own inside anyway. So if we're cranky and controlling and critical of ourselves, then we'll be exactly that way to others on the outside. And so we actually do need to do that noble training on the inside first through Anapanasati, is to really get our own mind together. In the 1960s or '70s, they had the expression, you got to get your shit together, man. Right. And then the joke is, is, yeah, I got all my shit together and now I can't move it, it's so heavy. But the idea of the unification of mind, which basically means we make friends with our own internal system, which means we wisely deal with these instincts. We're not trying to get rid of them because they keep us alive. If we didn't have any instincts, our wisdom wouldn't be sufficient. But what we do with Anapanasati practice is by developing the wisdom, We let the wisdom now guide the instincts. An example of that would be fear. If you know that you would feel fear if you go into that particular bar, then don't go into that particular bar. Let's use our wisdom. Let's not charge in there and then wind up in danger. And so this is— but children, we can't teach them that, but we can adults. So we give children rules. And now we all grow up as adults using rules as a substitute for our own wisdom. And so what we need to do then is to start looking at what's going on and figuring out what's going on so that we'll know how to deal with things wisely. We can see how things are tending, see how things are going that way. So this is part of that getting your mojo together, getting your Samma Sanghappa. Everybody here has probably had enough mathematics to know about an equation with an equal sign, they're common. And then a little bit later in there, then you learn about greater than, equal, less than, greater than or equal, less than or equal. And then a little further into math, you learn about equal. Equivalencies, which take into consideration errors. But what we're going to do here is we're going to change that sign, because most of them, we go around greater than or less than. That's what our culture operates on: I'm greater than you, or I'm less than you. And we can only make friends with those that we think are equal. But we can change that equation sign into a heart shape. That's the way to go, is to stop comparing ourselves to others and treat them as friends. The Dhamma is all about friendship, but the first place that it comes in is within our own minds, which means that we learn to control these instincts, make them our, let us say, our allies or our companions. Rather than our masters, because mostly we are driven by our instincts ignorantly. And now it's time to wake up. And how we do that waking up is by this thought that comes to mind, sitting there silently, and this thought comes up: what am I going to do with it? Well, in Anapanasati, we're going to examine that thought. Is this thought worth having or not? Because often we're thinking the thoughts that are repetitive, going over and over again. Every time we have the thought, we feel bad, we feel like we've got work to do, we feel uptight and upset. And all we have to do is change those thoughts in the moment. I could see that thought and I can make a change to it. So if we can do that over and over and over and over again, we become successful at being able to control what kind of thoughts that we're going to have. That's an amazing quality, to be able to know that you can in fact control the thoughts that you're having. You've learned to control your breathing, you've learned to control your thoughts. Guess what the next item on the list is? What Scott was talking about, that Samma Sanghappa, which is get our feelings in line with our thoughts. And our body. We get the body relaxed, we get the mind wholesome, and we do this over and over again. And then we actually, instead of just knowing that we're comfortable and safe and secure in our posture, we can actually feel safe and secure. We can get down to that point that right now the self-preservation instinct can become a lapdog. He does not have to be a barking Anagami, Arhat, and Anapanasati are masked on. So, we learn to control these feelings by the reality is getting ourselves in a real, safe, secure, comfortable environment, and then capitalize on that reality, so that we actually think about being safe, secure, comfortable, relaxed, secure, and satisfied. That right now what I'm doing is okay. And so we do that over and over again, and pretty soon we add that additional point about success. Success— that's where the winner starts to build in. I can do this. I can control my mind. I can throw out all of those woulds and shoulds and coulds and all of that kind of stuff and just be comfortable right here, right now. And so go ahead, Alex.

**Speaker C:** I wanted to share two things, also say thank you to both of you, of course. Let me figure out how to make the technology hand go away.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** One, there's something I had been reading in the Dhamma as of recently, and it really intrigued me because what it talked about is something Dhammarato has talked about often, which is we don't know what is or is not present in another's mind in a direct way. We must observe behavior over a long time. And Dhammarato has talked to me about Arahantship in the past, and I've learned a great deal from it and looked into it myself to understand better. For even an Arahant, Nibbana is not annihilation. Nibbana is a cooling off. Nibbana is Realizing, not caring anymore.

**Speaker A:** You just don't care about anything. Everything is all right. I can handle anything.

**Speaker C:** We still have Sankhara. We still have mental formation take place upon, you know, sense contact. But the difference is we don't have Samskara. We don't have strong contact in such a way that a strong mental formation arises. This is an Arahant. They still have it. It still comes. But they understand it'll also still go, and they've been doing it long enough that this is a very nice response.

**Speaker A:** That they have programmed.

**Speaker D:** Yes, Scott, another way to point out Arahants is they have no quarrels with anyone. So they're not quarreling with anyone in the world. So like, they don't have conflicts with other people because they.

**Speaker C:** Because they don't care.

**Speaker D:** They're too busy.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Now here's something that's kind of interesting, that I'm seeing something play out that I knew a long time ago and watched it play out then, and that is the Arahant does not make a good Dhamma teaching because he doesn't care whether you get the Dhamma or not. And that the examples of that would be that the Arahant will just sit there for a long time and let people just go on and on and on and on, and then he'll do a one-liner, he'll do a zinger, and that's the only Dhamma you'll ever get out of him is a zinger. But the better teachers are those that in fact there's a kind of a standard, and the standards, there's several of them. One is, in order to be a teacher of the Dharma, one should have the fruit of the Dharma, the fruit of the Sotapanna, the joy, the enthusiasm, because that stuff really rubs off. So that's the best kind of teacher to have, is one who is really enthusiastic about you becoming enthusiastic about the Dharma. The next level down would be the the path of Srotapanna, not actually the fruit, but he's far enough along that he can impart correct Dhamma. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has a standard that's a little bit lower than that, and that is that even though he's not Srotapanna yet, he at least understands Paticcasamuppada, that that's really the bottom line, that if someone does not understand how the mind works, works, then he should not be teaching Dharma, and yet you'll find that in the West a lot, that people teach the Dhamma just because they like it. They think they can make some money off of it, but that they really don't quite understand how the mind works. Yes, Scott, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Another thing about teaching that brought something up for me in my mind is I heard a past spiritual teacher say this, and it seems pretty true for— I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems pretty true for most authentically awakened people who are quote-unquote teaching. It's less of a trying to teach someone else as it is like a bird sitting on its branch singing its song just for the sake of singing its song. Like, it's just the beauty of doing it and the enjoyment of actually doing it. It's not like— it's not for the motive of, uh, what's going to happen or if they're going to get it or not, or what's— if it was going to work. It's because in the teaching, when they're giving the teaching, they're telling you their current experience. So they're just singing along, like, they're just happy. It's so much fun to do. It's so much fun to talk about.

**Speaker A:** Like, you probably heard me talk about that. Yes, because people say, well, why do you teach so much? And thank you, and all of that kind of stuff. And my answer to that is, is that I'm doing this because I like it. This is fun, sharing the Dhamma and watching you guys share the Dhamma and grow with each other. That's just the best part.

**Speaker C:** It was one of the reasons I came back over and over, Dhammarato, is you said, I don't do this because of duty to Dharma, I don't do this because that the other thing, I do this because I get a kick.

**Speaker A:** Out of it, right? That this is enjoyable, just like that bird sitting on that, uh, singing his song.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's why I do the Wednesday calls.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you enjoy doing it. Exactly.

**Speaker D:** And since starting doing those calls, that my practice is also like accelerated, like it like increased it because like the best way to learn something is to teach it. Like I think Einstein said that something is like if you can't teach it to like a 5th grader, you don't really understand it. Like you have to be able to teach it.

**Speaker A:** You have to be able to speak the Buddhist teaching.

**Speaker D:** There is actually— Oh, sorry, I'll just stop real quick. Um, the— that's another thing about the Buddha is that he spoke the language of the person he was teaching to. So the Dharma was explained in like different ways depending on the person. And probably one of my favorite stories was a not so intelligent guy who's— he's not going to understand all of the, um, links of dependent origination and all the Jhanas.

**Speaker A:** He couldn't even learn the chanting. So yes, I know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, he gave him a rock and a cloth and he said, rub this rock and as you purify the rock, you purify your mind. So it's like incredibly simple, but also there's so much detail and like there's so much nuance to it. Like there's so much— I feel like I'm learning something every time like I'm reading another sutta. Like It's always something else to learn.

**Speaker C:** And especially if you contemplate it afterwards, oh, it can be almost immediate. You know, you take it in, you let it soak and suffuse, and come back and read it again. You go, oh, how'd I miss that?

**Speaker D:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** So there's a sutta that talks about this. It says, in fact, that there is 5 ways to learn the Dharma. One is to listen to the teacher. Number 2 is to share it with your other friends. Number 3 is to mull it over. Number 4 is to recite, like with the sutras, read them over and over again, or recite it, because that puts us in the mind state. And then the 5th item on that list is the big one, and it's well known within the Sangha, and that is that we have to put ourselves in the position of teaching the Dharma, especially if we're around people who are discerning and know something about the Dharma. And so we want to make sure that we're teaching it correctly. You see, when we're just thinking about the Dharma, we can think about most anything, but when you go out there to teach, you want to make sure that what you're teaching is correct. So my own practice has greatly, greatly improved over the the fact that I've been teaching. And I'm really, really proud of you, Scott, for doing that. Your Dharma will really grow because of that, as well as just taking that time to voice it and to speak it. So this is part of the practice, is to share the Dharma with others, that everybody can be a teacher if they understand what they're teaching. And the best way to understand what we're teaching is by teaching it. And, and so, uh, in fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po had me teaching before I was ordained.

**Speaker D:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And, and, uh, that's a, that's a great thing, uh, because in Thailand there's a tradition that only monks can teach the Dharma. But that's not the case at all. Even in the time of the Buddha, there were lay people who were very famous teachers. There's in fact one— go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I went to a Thai wat recently, and the abbot there, he wasn't fluent in English, but we're talking about the Dharma because it's not really in the language. So like, he— I understood the Dharma, but he didn't understand English. So he was like, oh, Yeah, please come teach the Dharma in English because the only Dharma talks they give are in Thai. And he was completely happy, he was completely encouraging of me to come and teach it in English.

**Speaker A:** Me too.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And yes, Dhammarato is such a sign because it's hard to find, it's hard to find the real Dhamma, the noble Dhamma in English. So it's like really lucky to find Dhammarato on here teaching on the internet. A thing I wanted to say is like once you do find a good teacher, like I approached the interaction with the teacher the same way. Like I was pretty good at sports, like I went Division 1 in college, but when I had a good coach, like I listened to what he told me and I did it and I didn't just argue with him. And I didn't say, oh, but that's not gonna work, or that's not the right way to do it. I listened to what the wisdom, the, the, the good coach was telling me, because he's been around the block a couple times. So he's been doing this a lot longer than you have. So you can take the wisdom from the old guys, and if you apply it diligently, now you're like, oh, now I see why he was saying that. Like, now I know experientially that it works. So that was the transition. Like.

**Speaker B:** All right guys, thank you so much. It was great meeting you guys tonight.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Before you go, before you go, I think that in fact this is probably a pretty good time to finish this. So does DJ, do you have anything to add to this conversation that we've had tonight? We've covered instincts and mojo and all kinds of stuff.

**Speaker D:** Just come on back to that mojo, baby, and chill.

**Speaker C:** I love it.

**Speaker A:** David, Matt, how do you go? How— what do you— you have any thoughts about it before we leave? Uh, yeah, it's interesting.

**Speaker C:** I thought you mentioned that this talk was going to be on racism at the beginning.

**Speaker A:** It has been, hasn't it? If you think about it, all of this territorial instinct and all of this one better than that, and we wind up being in competition. We're racist for everybody. That's what the competition is all about, is to come out of that territorial instinctual thing that things are dangerous. So thanks for remembering that so that we can tie that back together. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Oh, another thing is, uh, the whole concept that anything that this is me, mine, or I is racist.

**Speaker A:** It's racist.

**Speaker D:** So that's what is like making a self, a continuous self that isn't there. And saying and giving it privilege over the others, that's what racism is, just on a bigger scale. So like, it's the same thing of getting rid of the— it's like a form of clinging, saying this is mine, this is me, this is I, this is my country, this is my land, my people, or even my body, my.

**Speaker A:** Thoughts.

**Speaker D:** My body, my thoughts, my feelings. My intentions, my Anicca, Anapanasati, everything. None of it is me, my Arhat, myself.

**Speaker C:** So that's liberating.

**Speaker A:** Right. So basically racism is nothing but the fact that we think that we belong to the human race. And all we need to do is stop the race. We're not racing, we're not in competition. You know, those other people out there, they can win too. We don't have to be that competitive, that that's what really is at the bottom line is that we're already okay. We've already run whatever races that we were in, and now it's time to just sit and relax and enjoy the fact that we're winners, that we can't control our own mind. So thanks for bringing that up. Yes, we are all racist. And yet look at how they do it. You know, one political party accuses the other one of being racist, and we're all racist. So stop racing.

**Speaker D:** I love it.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much, guys. We'll see you all later. See you, David. See you soon.

**Speaker B:** Take care. Nice meeting you, Alex. Take care, guys.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for coming, Scott.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Have a wonderful Christmas time.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Happy holidays. Every day is a holiday.

**Speaker D:** Every day is a holiday, actually. Yeah, always cause for celebration. All right, bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye, you guys. Bye-bye, Gigi.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, explores human instincts, their relationship to suffering, and the path to liberation through Buddhist practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Theme: Instincts, Integration, and Liberation**
The discussion begins with the observation that traits like racism and tribalism stem from deep-seated **instincts**, not inherent evil. Using the example of wolves in Yellowstone, they illustrate the **territorial instinct** as a natural, survival-based behavior common to all animals.

### **Main Points**

1.  **Instincts Are Not the Problem; Disassociation Is:**
    * Humans share four basic instincts: **self-preservation, procreation/creation, territoriality, and social/herding**.
    * Suffering arises not from the instincts themselves, but from their **misuse, distortion, or disassociation** by societal conditioning. The goal is not to eliminate instincts but to **integrate and wisely guide them** with mindfulness and wisdom.

2.  **The Path of Integration vs. Suppression:**
    * Drawing on Jung ("I would rather be whole than good"), the talk emphasizes **wholeness (Dharmakaya)** over a fractured "goodness" defined by culture.
    * Just as removing wolves damaged Yellowstone's ecosystem, suppressing natural instincts (like aggression) weakens our wholeness. The path is to **expand the circle of care** and integrate these energies skillfully.

3.  **Fear and the Self-Preservation Instinct:**
    * The fundamental instinct is **self-preservation**, communicated through fear. While essential for survival, it becomes a major source of suffering when projected onto non-threatening situations.
    * Modern society and propaganda often manipulate this fear. The practice involves transforming this instinct from a master into an ally.

4.  **From Animal State to Noble State:**
    * Unchecked, our conditioned instincts keep us in a "woeful animal state"—like a draft animal compelled by others, doing work we resent, living in comparison and competition ("greater than/less than").
    * Through **Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and **Sammā Saṅkappa (Right Intention/Resolve)**, we train the mind. We learn to:
        * Examine and choose our thoughts.
        * Cultivate feelings of safety, comfort, and success from within.
        * Shift from a mindset of competition to one of **friendship and equivalence** (symbolized by replacing the "greater than" sign with a heart).

5.  **The End of Craving and the Nature of Awakening:**
    * The Buddha's teaching on **craving for being** and **craving for non-being** is linked to the self-preservation instinct and the fear of death. The Middle Path transcends both.
    * An **Arahant** (fully awakened one) doesn't annihilate instincts or feelings but ceases to **cling** to them. They experience Nibbāna as a cooling, a profound peace where sankharas (formations) arise and pass without creating samskaras (volitional knots) or internal conflict. They "have no quarrels with the world."

6.  **The Joy of Teaching and Sangha:**
    * Authentic Dhamma teaching is compared to a bird singing its song—it springs from **joy and natural enthusiasm**, not duty.
    * Teaching is a powerful practice that deepens understanding. The Sangha provides essential support, reminding practitioners they are not alone.

### **Conclusion: The Root of "Racism" and the End of Racing**
The talk circles back to its starting point, redefining "racism" broadly as any **clinging to "me" and "mine"**—whether to ideas, territory, identity, or even one's own body and thoughts. This is the ultimate expression of the territorial instinct.

The solution is to **stop the inner and outer "racing"**—the competition and comparison fueled by instinctual clinging. True liberation comes from integrating our nature, cultivating inner peace through meditation, and realizing we are already "winners" when we gain mastery over our own minds.

**In essence:** The talk guides us from being driven by distorted instincts to becoming wise, integrated beings who meet life with friendship, joy, and unshakable inner peace.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about human nature, instincts, and spiritual practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**
1.  **The Wolf Tribes in Yellowstone:** Used as a central metaphor for the **territorial instinct**. The story shows how wolves naturally form tribes with borders, illustrating that tribalism and territoriality are deep, instinctual behaviors shared by humans and animals. This is linked to racism and the concept of "this is mine."
2.  **The House Cat vs. The Wild Tiger/Wolf:** Represents the **taming or domestication of human instincts**. Speakers contrast the "house cat" (modern, pacified, perhaps disconnected from nature) with the "wild tiger" or the hardened, perfected wolf on the Tibetan plateau (in touch with raw instinct and the environment). This explores the tension between natural instinct and socialization.
3.  **The First Stone Tool (The Hand Axe):** A metaphor for the **procreation/materialism instinct**. The story of the early human who kept a useful rock (unlike an otter that drops it) symbolizes the birth of ownership, tools, weapons, and materialism—extending to modern cell phones and weapons.
4.  **The Donkey Grinding Sugarcane & The Horse Plowing Its Own Pasture:** Powerful metaphors for **exploitation and ignorant labor**. They illustrate how humans (and society) use beings (including themselves) as "draft animals," forcing them to work against their own interest, symbolizing unwise living and societal coercion.
5.  **The Bird Singing Its Song:** Represents **teaching Dhamma (Dharma) out of joy, not duty**. A good teacher shares like a bird sings—naturally, happily, and without ulterior motive for the outcome. This contrasts with teaching for gain or from a sense of obligation.
6.  **Mathematical Comparison Symbols (>, <, =) transformed into a Heart:** A metaphor for **shifting from judgment to friendship**. The culture teaches us to see others as greater than, less than, or equal. The Dhamma encourages replacing that with a "heart shape"—seeing others with friendliness and without competitive comparison.
7.  **Lapdog vs. Barking Guard Dog:** Describes **transforming the self-preservation instinct (fear)**. Through practice, the raw instinct of fear can become a manageable "lapdog" rather than a threatening, out-of-control force.
8.  **Rubbing a Rock with a Cloth:** A story (attributed to the Buddha) about a simple teaching method. It's a metaphor for **tailoring the profound Dhamma to the learner's capacity**—purifying the mind through simple, repetitive action suited to the individual.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **Reintroduction of Wolves in Yellowstone:** The extended story details how wolves, by acting on their natural instincts (including predation), inadvertently became "geoengineers" that restored riverbanks and ecosystem balance. This story is used to argue for the **integration, not removal, of instinctual qualities** (like aggression) into a larger, harmonious system.
2.  **Personal Encounter with Wolves on the Tibetan Plateau:** Speaker B shares a vivid personal story of encountering a pack of wolves. The wolves' hardened perfection and unbroken stride in a harsh environment evoked a sense of the "holy" and made the speaker feel the "sin" of being overly tamed and disconnected from raw nature.
3.  **Romulus, Remus, and Tarzan:** Referenced as examples of **"feral children"** raised by animals, who remained in a more instinctual, unsocialized state. This highlights the role of human society in warping natural instincts.
4.  **The Child Kicking the Dog/Chair:** A story from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa used to illustrate the **origin of dukkha (suffering)**. The child's mother kicking a dog (introducing aversion) and the child later stubbing a toe and kicking a chair (mistaking an object for a separate self that can be blamed) shows how ignorance and ill-will are socialized from a young age.
5.  **The Simple Man and the Buddha's Teaching:** Referenced by Speaker D, this is the story behind the "rubbing the rock" metaphor. The Buddha gave a simple, actionable instruction to a man who couldn't grasp complex doctrine, demonstrating **skillful means in teaching**.
6.  **Jimmy Durante / Coneheads Song ("Stay Go"):** Used as a lighthearted but profound illustration of the **life-death cycle in everyday moments**. The ambivalence of wanting to "go" and "stay" mirrors the constant mini-cycles of birth and death (ending and beginning) we experience with every change.

### **Overarching Narrative**
The talk weaves these metaphors and stories into a larger narrative: **Human beings are born with primal instincts (territoriality, self-preservation, procreation/materialism, social/nesting). Society and ignorance warp these instincts, leading to suffering, racism, and conflict. The path of Dhamma is not about eliminating these instincts, but about integrating them with wisdom—expanding the "tribe" to include all, transforming fear into security, and finding joyful freedom within.** The stories from nature (wolves, Yellowstone) serve as powerful mirrors for this process of integration and healing.
