### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, here we go. So this is our Sunday afternoon Sangha call. For the UK, it's in the morning. Cat's actually here on the porch with me. And Carl, you were making the point about the telephone cords or the headphone cords that are use the curly stuff like this. And you were talking about how it's hard to get it untangled sometimes. And as you can see, for me, it just pulls right apart. There's nothing to it. In the old days, telephones, you know, the kind of telephones that had a receiver like this, and there was a cord that goes down, and some of those would be very, very long and have these curly cords in it. And that I have been around phones in businesses and whatnot that looked like it was a complete mess. And there's an easy way to do it, and that is that you hold it by the cord and just let the phone dangle, and what it'll start to do is unwind itself. Let the gravity kind of do it for you. And this is kind of an analogy of how the mind gets all tangled up like that, and that if we try to untangle it the way that you're talking about, it can sometimes make it worse. Okay, so what we're talking about here is actually that we're trying to figure things out We want to know, that desire to know is built into us in instinct, because if we know whether something is dangerous or not, we'll know how to behave around it. And so, there's an instinctual component that has that quality of the self-preservation. But in our society, we really, really take and put a lot of work into that so that the kids, when they're growing up, are put under pressure to know. And so when we get into the practice of Anapanasati and start doing some meditation, that desire to know comes in, and that's why we're madly trying to untangle it. Is because we want to know. We don't like it when we don't know, and so we put a lot of effort into it, to where the really easy way to do it is just to let things dangle, watch what's going on, maybe let it roll around, spin around a little bit, and it'll untangle itself. So the mind will actually kind of do that too. And the pulling on it, like the gravity that is pulling on that phone handset, does all the work for us. So true, we can say that right noble effort is to let things kind of unwind all by themselves, and that the average beginning meditator puts a lot of work into trying to straighten that out. Rather than merely just cutting right through it. There is the story of the Gordian Knot. This is a very, very ancient story, probably 3,000 years old or so, and that there was a rope that was all tied up in a very, very big fancy knot, and that everybody who would try to unravel that thing, and nobody was able to unravel it until Gordian came by, and he took his sword out and he cut the knot with the sword. That unraveled that knot pretty well. Okay, so this is the kind of way that now we can say that, well, really, the idea is that we really don't have to unravel that knot. We don't have to take it apart. That way, that in fact we can cut right through it immediately. And the way that we can say that in practice of Anapanasati is to just drop it, to just cut it loose, to let it go all by itself. It'll unravel itself on its own, but the important thing for us in the practice is to put the right effort in it to gladden the mind. So never mind what it was, that problem that I was trying to solve and figure out, put all of that work into it. Maybe it's this, maybe it's that, and all of that is just to say, hey, I don't have to solve that problem right now. We just cut right through it. It's not really a problem until we thought it was, and now we're making it a problem. When in fact there was no problem to it ever. So the practice then is not trying to figure things out. That's an amazing point, because a lot of people think that what practice of meditation is all about is to figure things out. And we're not here to figure things out, we're here to observe instead. There's not much of figuring to it. In fact, figuring is the same thing as cogitation, conceptualization, and whatnot with the mind that way. And the better thing to do is to say, oh, I don't have to have that, I don't need it right now, I don't have to unravel that telephone cord, and just leave it the way that it is. And so if you also understand that due to the fact that most people are right-handed, they tend to wrap the cords in a certain way, that if a left-handed person is using the telephone, often he will keep it naturally unraveled and unmessed up. Because the right-handed people keep turning the phone in the same circle direction, and the left-handed person is turning it in an opposite direction, kind of unraveling the thing. And so that's the way to do it, is to just let the thing dangle, that telephone just dangle, and it will kind of unwrap itself, because it was wrapped up in a certain way. And the mind is exactly that way too, that it will unravel itself when we stop spinning in a certain direction and start spinning in the opposite direction. Now, what does this mean is that normally when we're spinning, we're spinning in an unwholesome direction. Whether it's clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't matter, that's depending upon the position. But when we wrap things in one way, they tend to get all in a ball. And so when we unravel it or go in the other direction with wholesome thoughts, then things just kind of unravel by themselves. So we really don't have to put our time and effort into unraveling things or trying to figure them out. Better still, just cut it through it, just to drop it, say, "That's not a problem that I have to solve right now." This is the way to handle it, because the human mind is such that we'll find all kinds of things that need to be unraveled. The mind is often filled with doubt, and that in fact, that unraveling it when we're sitting in meditation trying to unravel it, the reason for it is because we think that we'll be better off if we can get get it unraveled, not recognizing that we're not very well off while we're trying to unravel it, that we're creating the problem by trying to unravel things. We don't need to unravel it. We can just forget all about it, leave it the way that it is. So Martin, good to see you. Thanks for joining. Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Hi, hi everybody.

**Speaker A:** Everything is good.

**Speaker B:** Great.

**Speaker A:** Carl just asked an easy question that was an easy answer. Took only 10 minutes to answer. Don't bother unraveling it. Go ahead, Carl.

**Speaker C:** I was going the direction as well as far as like seeing how the mind gets tangled up in first place. Because I was using analogy, if you put your headphones like the AirPods like kids would have, you would put them in your pocket and you're not looking, they get tangled up throughout the day. Because you're not looking at what's going on. So getting caught up in that entanglement is what happens to majority of people. But I was seeing my mind rising, my mind, my thoughts just coming up and they're trying to tangle me up throughout, distract me from the present moment constantly by trying to tangle me up into that state of entanglement. Which was kind of Pretty fascinating because this whole analogy kind of clicked. It's like, I don't have to get tangled up in the first place. I don't have to untangle anything, but because I don't have to get tangled up in the first place at all.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, there's another way of looking at it, and that is that most of the tangles that we find are actually really old. The things got tangled up a long time ago. And that there's no reason to try to untangle it, rather just drop it. Those old things, we don't need to unravel it, we don't need to understand it. That in fact, an example of what we're talking about now would be the concept of psychological archaeology. A lot of psychologists and psychiatrists, they want the plant to talk about their childhood and that kind of thing, with the idea that, "Oh, if we can find out how the tangle got started in the first place, then it will be easier to untangle it." And the Buddha says, "No, that's not correct." That in fact, we don't need to know the first cause. What we need to see is what's happening right now. And basically what's happening right now is not a tangle. What's happening right now is that I'm stuck in trying to untangle it. There's a difference between things being tangled up versus being caught up in trying to untangle it. And so here's where the real practice comes in, is that, hey, we don't have to untangle it. Hello, Daniel. We're talking about the tangles of the mind and how the fact that we don't have to untangle things. I don't hear you.

**Speaker D:** Oh, sorry, I was muted. But I was saying my headphone, I'm trying to connect them, but you can go on without me.

**Speaker A:** So we could also go so far as to say that when we're trying to untangle things, this is the same thing as the hindrance of restless and worry, and it has a sister component of doubt. The doubt comes in is, oh, I think I need to know this in order to be happy. And then we get in trying to figure it out, trying to untangle that stuff. You know, a lot of people will do that with the phrase of, well, why did I do that? Why do I do those things? Then we try to figure out why we do those things, and we get lost in those untangling And the right way to practice instead is, never mind, I don't have to untangle that. I could be happy while that thing is all tangled up. I can sit down beside it and just be happy. I don't have to untangle it at all. Which leads me into the story that my dad taught me. One of the things that I remember really well about him, he was actually a— he worked really hard. He did a lot of meter reading and pipe laying and that kind of stuff, a very active blue-collar kind of job. And yet, he was the one who said, "Work? I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside work and go to sleep. I'm not afraid of it at all." So this is the way that we need to start thinking about it, is that we don't have to put in all of the work of figuring things out. We can leave it undone, because it's not dangerous, and just relax. We don't have to put in that work of figuring it out. What we need to do instead is to figure out how to be happy, and that's easy enough. All we have to do is stop trying to figure stuff out and just let it be undone. Let it be a mess, it's okay. I could be happy while there's a mess. I don't have to untangle it. Even if that mess is in the mind, I don't have to untangle that. I don't have to figure myself out. That in fact, this is several points about that that are in the suttas. The one that I'm thinking about now is the Saba Asava Sutta, where people get into the Buddha's word for word that we're using for tangle, he calls it a thicket of views. The kind of views, the thicket of views would be like, who am I? What am I? What was I in the past? How did the past get here? What's in the future? Who am I now that's going to be in the future? Etc., like that. Or we try to unravel the concept that The favorite one, by the way, that the Western Buddhist is, is trying to figure out the knot of anatta. OK, does the self see self as self, or does the self see self as no-self? Or does no-self see no-self as self, or does no-self see no-self as no-self, etc.? You could get all kinds of twisted up, all kinds of questions. That don't need to be answered, that are only, let's say, intellectual questions that we spend a lot of time on, that are kind of useless. Here we could just be happy instead of trying to figure out who I am, that in fact you probably never will figure out who you are, because you're a moving target. The example that I would give is, just sit down, maybe everybody today after the talk, Sit down and write down everything that you know about yourself that's true. And then next week, do that exercise again. And then the third week, compare those first two and recognize that you're not the same, that over that course of the week, even who you think you are has changed. Everything's set up to change. And if we try to straighten everything out, That's just a lot of work, and we're not ever going to straighten anything out. Better just to be happy the way things are, which means we don't have to figure it out. That's back to that idea of the Gordian Knot— is just cut it in half, just drop it, we don't need it. So Carl, does that answer your question? Oh yeah.

**Speaker C:** The question is— the question doesn't even arise anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm sorry, did you say that again?

**Speaker C:** I said the question does not even like come up to my mind. I, I can see it, I can see it, I can see the— I can see it clearly.

**Speaker A:** Right? But those hindrances are persistent. And we have to see the hindrances as hindrances so that we can throw them right out. Doubt is a major hindrance. Am I doing it right, Daddy? Am I supposed to do a count of 4 on the in-breath or count to 5 on the in-breath? I mean, we can just get all balled up about how we're supposed to do things exactly right according to some standards or some set of rules. And the better thing to do is just to play with it.

**Speaker C:** Well, that's just trying to figure out again, should I count to 4 or should I take this breath or should I do this? That's just like you trying to figure out like another thing, like trying to figure out meditation, which is again, you're playing a game on yourself.

**Speaker A:** Right. We're making troubles trying to answer questions that we don't need the answer to, that everybody knows what it is to take a deep breath. And just relax. Everybody knows how it is to relax. We just don't relax often enough because we're too busy trying to figure things out. And so now we've got to figure out how to relax. Well, we don't have to figure it out. We just relax. We don't have to figure out anything. We can just drop all of those doubts, all of those worries, recognize that that's what's preventing me from being happy. And then I said, "Wow, I don't have to figure it out. I don't have to figure out who I am. I don't have to figure out what is self and no-self. I don't have to figure anything out. I can just simply relax and be happy." Because all of that figuring out is a hindrance. And not only that, but if we actually did wind up figuring it out, we wouldn't get the kind of satisfaction that we could if we just dropped it. Because now we still have the doubt, "Well, did I figure it out right?" And there's no end to second-guessing. Which leads to another point, is that in our civilization, in our society, the kids are taught to guess. And a much better way is, is that if you are unsure, to figure out that you're unsure and be satisfied that you don't know, you're unsure. This is why ignorance is actually— they call it the higher fetters. There's 10, 5 of the lower fetters and 5 of the higher fetters. Ignorance is the last item on the list, not necessarily in chronological order, but it's the last on the list in the sense that we eventually get to the point that we can be comfortable and satisfied, even though we have very limited knowledge. It's OK to be ignorant about so many things, because I'm not ignorant about the things that I actually need. I've got enough of that knowledge. What knowledge do I need? The knowledge to be happy. That's all the knowledge that I need, is the knowledge to just drop all those problems and just sit and enjoy life. Be in the present moment without any problems or worries. And so we don't have to figure things out, we don't have to create a thicket of views. We can just recognize all of those kinds of things are Dukkha, all of those kinds of things are hindrances, and we say, "I don't need that. I can just throw it out and just be happy instead. I don't have to untangle anything." But we want to untangle it, we want to know, we want that knowledge of where things come from. And we're not ever going to figure out where everything comes from. It doesn't even matter. We can be happy without that knowledge, and we will be miserable if we have to have it, because we'll never figure it out. So that comes all the way back to that one point about enough. You already have enough to be happy. You have the ability to remember, to look at the Dukkha, see what it is, take the effort to change it, and then congratulate yourself. That's the only 4 things that you need to know. We don't even need to know the entire Eightfold Noble Path, just 4 points of the Eightfold Noble Path is enough. So does anybody have any questions about this? I mean, this is a whole teaching of the Dharma, and look, it doesn't take but about 10-20 minutes to talk about it in this video. That's all there is to it.

**Speaker C:** I think once you have like good, good ways of connecting it, as, as you do, like with analogies, then it becomes very simple to teach, doesn't it?

**Speaker A:** I see that Daniel has left. Maybe he's coming back in. Oh, that's why the screen is flashing back and forth.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, for some reason my, uh, my camera keeps tripping the application. But, uh, I do have a question.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker D:** Um, is this how you have always you practiced under Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, under Buddhadasa, or has your style of practice changed over the years?

**Speaker A:** Oh, for sure. Yes, I started out in psychology in Ann Arbor, Michigan, University of Michigan, and it was basically most of the students were in psychiatric nursing. The University of Michigan had a big psychiatric nursing thing. They had their own state hospital, Ypsilanti State Hospital, close by. So that's where it all started. And from there, I found that Muktananda had an ashram way, way back when, you know, in the middle '70s. Muktananda had an ashram in Ann Arbor, Michigan. So I stayed there and I stayed in the dorm, I also stayed in my van during the better part of the weather. But that's what led me by 1976 to go to India. So I left. I was actually teaching college, and because of that I had the summers off, so I spent a summer in India, and then another summer, and then another summer, until I was spending a lot of time in India.

**Speaker D:** You've had so many jobs: engineer, computer programmer, teacher, psychologist. Well, what do I miss?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what happens when you get old, you've got a long past. So it was from there, basically I was interested in two things in India. One, in fact, they work together, and that is, what is meditation and what's the uses and properties of it? And the other was magical powers. I wasn't so much interested in rebirth and reincarnation, but you had an awful lot of swamis who could sit in mid-air. You had an awful lot of swamis who could generate Rolls-Royces and not Rolls-Royces. Osho, they say he had 95. I don't know whether he got them magically or whether he stole them. There's another guy, Satchidananda Sai Baba in Bangalore, who would manifest Rolex watches until I came to understand that he manifested the same Rolex watch to the same guy in a big ceremony every time. The guy actually owned the Rolex. He was the only one who knew that it was all a scam. Everybody else was so impressed when Sai Baba would come up with yet another Rolex. Another thing that he would do is he would take ash out of a fire and turn it into a paste and then roll them into small balls like the shape of a grain of rice and then lodge them between his fingers. And then while he was doing all of his magical ceremonies or whatnot, he would rub that stuff and get it all into a ball, and then he would poof, like that, and spread holy ash all over half a dozen young Indian girls, and they would all giggle because they thought that it was magic. So that was one thing, and I did travel around. I mean, everybody who was famous enough got a visit from me. So I went to Amma in Kerala and Mother somebody or another in Pondicherry, and Satchidananda. The only place that I didn't really get to was Dharmasala, but I was kind of on the way there when I stopped in— I was staying in Bodhgaya. I had finally, because of Goenka, changed out of the Hindu magical, all of that kind of stuff, into actual the teachings of the Buddha, and Goenka was the first teacher. But then I kind of began to figure out that he was— there was something missing, that this is not enough, there's something missing here. And so I left and I was staying then in Bodh Gaya when I met a monk that was from Thailand. In fact, he was from Wat Phananachat, and he was the one that basically— not Wat Phananachat, sorry, Wat Chulapatthan in Bangkok. Who was the abbot of Wat Chulapatthan, was a very, very close friend of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Now, Wat Chulapatthan is a huge wat in Bangkok, so this guy was very, very famous, but he always saw himself as a student of Bhikkhuni. So from there, I went to Wat Suwan Mokkh. But I had a lot of teachers. I had Goenka and Muktananda, and I wouldn't say that I was a student of many of the others. I just stayed long enough to recognize that, nope, this is not what I'm looking for. Sort of like the Buddha, he had one thing in mind: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And he went to a whole lot of different teachers, and whatever they were taught it would not come down to that this is the end of suffering, that even the guys who were practicing meditation in the high Jhanas and neither perception or non-perception and nothingness and boundaryless, all of that kind of stuff, they did that before the Buddha became enlightened. He was doing that kind of stuff and it wasn't satisfying. Why? Because when the guys would come out of those Jhana states, they would go right back into the hindrances. This is when he found out that all the real point is, is that we have to develop the first Jhana to the point that we can stay in it. This is why it needs to be sustained and sustained and sustained. And yet all the Westerners, when they hear about Buddhism and they hear about all of these Jhanas, wow, they get quite a list of things that they want. Oh, I want poor Jhana. Oh, I want to see magic. Oh, I want to have spiritual powers. Oh, I want to be a Srotapanna. Oh, I want to be an Arahant. Oh, I want, I want, I want, I want Nibbana. And all of that desire is preventing them from being happy. They think that they'll be happy when they get any of that stuff, but in fact they don't have it. They're not happy. And so they're actually not developing the first Jhana, because the first Jhana is don't worry, be happy. Don't try to untangle any knots, you don't need to untangle. Oh, hello DJ, wow. Hello. So does anybody else have any question? I think that that's enough on old history. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** My question was more about your time under Buddhadasa. Like, has your practice, your style of practice changed under Buddhadasa? Because he was still practicing one-pointed concentration up until somewhere in the 1980s. And I was wondering, like, your practice seems to differ a bit from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. So did you develop it more or less on your own, or how did it come to be?

**Speaker A:** Well, I would say that mostly, though I did spend quite a lot of time with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, it was almost always arranged by Achan Po, that he would find a time when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa didn't have anything, and then he would be like a matchmaker, and he or the secretary to make the appointments. But most of the training that I got was from Achan Po himself, and just being around him was the training with many, many tiny little things. Like, he was very, very good at sneaking up on me. I don't use the word sneaking up correctly because he wasn't sneaky. He just would walk up to me while I wasn't paying attention and surprise me. Okay, this is, this is actually an excellent training tool, but Westerners don't have it, and, uh, they don't have the master around to be able to do it. Here's an example of that would be that Achan Bhikkhu, Achan Po, would stand outside of my kuti, either on the path or in the front yard if it had a front yard, and just stand there and wait for me to figure out that I need to check up on what's happening. That was a great deal of be here now. Okay, and so I began to start watching for him so that I'd know when he would show up. And sometimes he would come up when I was not in the kuti, that I would be out, you know, ceremonies and whatnot like that. And then he would sneak up right behind me and say something and then trot along off. He didn't have good English, but he sure knew how to— he was quite a Zen master with his Zen stick. But his Zen stick was just a couple of words. He'd come right up behind me and he'd say something, and that would wake me right up, come into the present moment. And he had two things that he would say on a regular basis. One was, 'Not sure.' He'd just come up and say, 'Not sure.' Okay, which is actually his teaching doing those two little words over and over and over again, "not sure, not sure," was actually the basis of today's talk, in the beginning of it. Right? "Not sure." What does that mean? It means we don't have to unravel all of that stuff. We can just leave it unraveled. I'm not sure about it, so what? I don't have to fix it, I don't have to figure it out. I can leave myself in the state of 'I don't know.' Isn't that marvelous? But you see, most of us in the Western tradition, when we don't know something, we feel bad because we're supposed to know it. Look how many years you spend in school to where you were expected to know stuff, and now you're in a foreign land and everything, you don't know anything. But that's marvelous, that's not a disaster. The next thing that he would say to me often was, "Tathagata," which is the Pali word for "be here now," "wakey wakey," "be in the present moment." And he would just come by and just say that. There was another occasion that I remember quite well. There is a particular kind of hornet or yellow jacket or wasp that is huge, big dude, about 3 or 4 times the size of an ordinary hornet. It's got black and yellow markings, so I think you would call it like a yellow jacket, but they're about this big, got a wingspan on them. I mean, when those things are flying, they make a ruckus in the air. These are big dudes. And here, one of them, while I was standing with Achan Po out in the woods, one of those things landed in the top of his head over on the left-hand side, right in the top. And that thing started crawling around while he was continuing to talk. He had quite a focus of mind, and he was testing me with that. I don't know if he'd have been off in the woods by himself with that wasp, what he would have done to it. But with me, he let it crawl all over his face. Well, not completely all over his face. It did come down to the left eyebrow down in this area, and that's when I made my move, which was only just a gesture, just raising my hand, and he was ready for it because he put his hand out. I mean, he was really fast about that. He was kind of anticipating that I would do something about that wasp, and he wasn't about to let me do it. And those are the kinds of things that are split-second. They happen really, really fast, and there's a very good deep teaching in there. And this was the kind of teaching that Ajahn Po was. Now he did know suttas, and in fact I checked him out on that, and he does know them by the Pali word. He's much better with that than I was, but he doesn't talk about the suttas at all. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa does, but Ajahn Po, he's more of a Zen master, the way that he behaved. And his stick that I got hit with so much was just a word here and there.

**Speaker D:** Interesting. And the gladdening of the mind, like as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, what did he say about that? Because I've read the books. And the description is very limited. It's basically like, force your mind to be happy, like do anything to make your mind happy. And but it doesn't say much beyond that.

**Speaker A:** Well, I heard him say it, I got it, and now that's what I talk about to the students. Very, very rarely do I ever find something that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has said recently, and I would disagree with it. I would go so far as to say that if you ever hear anything that I say that disagrees with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, go with Bhikkhuni Buddha Dasa until you figure out that he and I are actually saying the same thing.

**Speaker D:** Well, actually, the one point that's concentration, you— he never really stepped away from that, right?

**Speaker A:** Say again?

**Speaker D:** That he never really stepped away from the one-pointed concentration for the Jhanas. We were still using the old, or the old, the Visuddhimaga, Visuddhimaga Jhanas, like the absorption jhanas?

**Speaker A:** Well, remember when I just told the story about the monk that I met in Bodhgaya who was from Wat Chulapatthan? He did some very strange things. One of the things that he did was that he, when he saw me one time, I was in the room, he came into my quarters there at the wat And here I am reading the Visuddhimagga, holding it in my hand. And I don't remember exactly what happened, but I do know that he immediately took it out of my hand and threw it across the room onto the bed, which monks don't take things out of people's hands. So this was definitely a Dhamma lesson, to take that book out of my hand and throw it across the room to land on the bed. I don't think the book itself— I've still got that same book here, and it's not too much worse for the wear for what he did. He didn't hurt it or damage the book, but that's when he kind of insisted that I got to go to Thailand, I've got to go meet Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Well, you see, what I have come to understand is, is that though Bhikkhuni Buddhadasa in his early times He, like all of the other monks, were very much into the Visuddhimagga, and in fact, in his first book on Anapanasati, he takes a lot of the stuff in there, in his writing, he took that out of the Visuddhimagga. And so over a period of years, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa became more and more, let's say, completely knowledgeable about what was in the Visuddhimagga and recognized that it just wasn't right, that there was something askew about everything there. And that's been known for centuries. In fact, one of the old arguments was that Buddhaghosa, the monk who did that, was a wise fool. In other words, he never practiced, he didn't know anything, all he did was gather data and gather information from all kinds of places and put it into a book. I would say that that's the way that most books are written in the West anyway, is they just go get stuff all over the place, cram it into a book, and publish it. Well, guess what? There is more to the story in the sense that knowing that Buddhaghosa's background and knowing some of the other literature, it looks like that he did know what he was doing. And that what he was doing was subterfuge. He actually intended to ruin Buddhism by bringing in all of that magic and all of that other stuff and obscure the real teachings of the Buddha. And as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa figured that out more and more and more, he changed to the point that when he was very old, very late in life, one of the things that he was quite famous for saying was that you can take the Vasudhi Marga Upadana, and all of that stuff, and the Abhidhamma, and throw it into the ocean. And Buddhism would be better off without it. Buddhism would be better off without the Abhidhamma, it would be better off without the Vasudhi Marga. But in that regard, the way that he taught Anapanasati, he continued to teach Anapanasati the way that he had practiced it through the Visuddhimagga, so that even the later students get hung up on that issue about the nose tip. But in the actual information there, and I had conversations with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa about this, was he said, "Let's go with the Anapanasati Sutta, let's go with the actual Suttas, because there It says the long breath, the short breath, the in-breath, the out-breath, and then examining the body and relaxing the body. This is the first quadrant, first four of the Anapanasati Sutta. No nose tip mentioned anywhere. But in the time of the writing of the Visuddhimagga, there was another word that was commonly used in the Pali And that actually translates to cave. Well, we can say something about the cave with the nose, but basically the cave would be the nostrils, the mouth, the throat, all the way down into the lungs. Just like some mammoth caves, they've got an entrance and then they've got some tunnel and then the cave opens into a real cathedral kind of place. Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico is like that, and the new one that they found in Vietnam is remarkably this way. So you can think of actually the way that caves operate, the human body operates like that too. So we actually have more evidence. But where did that cave then get attached to the nose. Now there is a good reason for bringing it down to the nose tip at a certain period of time in the practice, but remember that the Anapanasati Sutta, the way that it's constructed, is primarily just for first Jhana. And yet the nose tip can be used to get the mind strongly focused enough to get into the second jhana. But I would not recommend the nose tip for the students ever, because who needs second jhana? When I'm happy, I can be just happy enough without second jhana. I don't need second jhana. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's really remarkable to figure out that, hey, the mind is just not talking, it's completely silent. So that's a point about the Visuddhimagga, was that even though Bhikkhu Bodhidassa was in his old age strongly against the book, still the way that he had been teaching on Anapanasati over the years and had written it down in so many places, that he still taught out of the Visuddhimagga. And that's one of the things that I would say, that that would be a One of the differences between Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and myself is that I don't ever hardly ever mention about the nose tip. It's not necessary.

**Speaker D:** You never practice that at the nose tip?

**Speaker A:** Well, I know a lot of guys who talk about it. In fact, almost all of the teachers that have been trained under Bhikkhuni will talk about the nose tip. Sati Kara will. Dhamma Vipassana in his retreat said deep of Bhavana, he talks about the nose tip sometimes. So you've done retreat there, so you know what I'm talking about.

**Speaker E:** I learned Anapanasati from Tanha Sarabhikkhu.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** He kind of said that has to be full body. It's very much like your teaching. You have to keep your awareness on the full body and you have to relax it. And he said that he got it from his teacher's teacher. So his teacher was Ajahn Fuang, and Ajahn Fuang's teacher was Ajahn Lee.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the Arhat Nidhamma. Dhammarato. Yes, yes.

**Speaker E:** And Anagami, I mean, he was maybe at Bhikkhu Buddhadasa time, and he figured it out himself. So he, Anagami, never talked about focusing it on the nose, but like, uh, trying to, trying to bring your awareness, uh, in all your body and relaxing. Okay, so I think this knowledge, this knowledge was there, uh, at least in Thailand for very, very long. To learn directly from the sutta and not to go to the Visuddhimagga.

**Speaker A:** Well, I think that all of Thailand is beginning to get that, that that was one of the profound things that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had on the entire culture of the monks in Thailand, was to come out of the teachings of the Visuddhimagga and go back into the suttas. There was actually a movement that was almost political. The name of it is Anicca Sok or Santi Sok. It's a big movement in Thailand, and that there's some controversy because of its original political stuff. But it's just one of the groups of the monks. And the whole point is, is that we only teach before what happened with Asoka, because in the time of Asoka, which is about 150 years after the Buddha, because it was a royal patronage, anybody who wanted to become a monk, yeah, they'd get a free robe, they'd get a free bowl, they'd get a free room. And so many of the Brahmins became Buddhist monks during that time so that they overwhelmed and overpowered the actual Sangha of monks who knew what the Buddha actually taught. This is where the division came between the Mahayana, or the Maha Sangha at the time, versus the Hinayana Sangha, or the smaller group of Arahants. And so they called a council, and the wrong place to have it was in the capital city of Rajagriha. They should have had it out in the woods so that none of those new monks could get in. But when they found out about it, they said, well, if you're not going to let us into the old boys' club, we're going to have a new boys' club because it's going to be a whole lot bigger, a big council of beginners rather than a small council of old established monks. And so that was where that division kind of thing happened.

**Speaker D:** I mean, Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Maha.

**Speaker D:** That literally means big, right? Yeah. In Pali. Is that where— Ah, so it's the big council and then the other one means small council.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker D:** Is that what you said?

**Speaker A:** Right. And there's two words. One is chula. And so you'll have the Maha The Large Sangha of the Lion's Roar, and then there'll be the Chula Sangha, or the Small Lion's Roar. I think it's 11 and 12, but there's a lot of suttas that start with the word chula, which means it's a short sutta, as opposed to maha, like the Mahatanga Subbhatta Sutta, number 38. Okay, that's a big one, and it's pages and pages long. So the Maha Sangha are the— what Mahatath means, the great element, the great one, just like Mahatma Gandhi, Maha Atta. So the word Hinayana, um, I have always thought let us say, over the years, that the word Hinayana was a put-down from the Westerners who were in Tibetan Buddhism, and that they were trashing the Theravada by calling it the Hinayana, until I met Thai monks and Sri Lankan monks which readily said, yeah, this is the Hinayana, no problem. It's not a derogatory word. At all, then in fact, here's the point, is that if you've got a great big— let us use the possibility of a cruise liner, you know, Carnival Cruise Line, right? And you have to stand in line and pay a fee and board up, and they'll feed you well. And they'll take you to places that you don't have any choice over, but you're on their big boat. Now, oppose that to a canoe. You're going to have to paddle the thing yourself, but you can go anywhere you want to. You shoot right across the lake. And so in that regard, everyone has to practice the Hinayana in their own seclusion and their own private practice. But once they begin to make friends in the Sangha, Anicca, now it becomes the Mahayana. So Theravada has both the Hinayana and the Mahayana, but guess what? The Tibetans also have both the Hinayana and the Mahayana. And so, making the distinction is just an ego trip: "Ah, we're better than you are, because we've got a great big boat here, we've got a Carnival cruise liner, and all you've got is a canoe." How you going to get on that cruise liner? I'm going to canoe right up to it. So, um, there was a great division in the time of Asoka, and that's when so much stuff got added into the teachings of the Buddha. It was fairly pure until that time. That we also know, for instance, that the Dhammarato wasn't written until the time of Asoka, and the reason that it was written was that it was sort of a bait and switch of trying to get the Brahmins to come out of their Hindu Brahmanism and come into the teachings of the Buddha. But the doorway has to be marked magic. And when you write magic over the top of the door, a whole lot of people are going to come into Buddhism, and then they find out that there was a subterfuge there, that this door is actually the door to reality. It's just got the label magic on it. And so that's where a lot of people come into the teaching of the Buddha. The question is, do they ever figure out that the teachings of the Buddha is not magical, it's real. It's real. Why? Because it's this mind that we don't have to untangle it. Magical thinking is that, oh, I have to untangle all of this stuff. And the noble part, the real part, is no, you don't have to untangle that mess. Just set it down, it's not important. Just sit down right beside it, go to sleep already, enjoy your life, stop trying to fix things that you think are broken, or let your sleeping dog lie, don't go around kicking your dog. And so this is the real teaching of the Buddha, and that we all start into Buddhism from our own magical thinking. Everybody's got magical thinking. The number one magical thought that people have is, who can I get to help me come out of my misery and suffering? I need a doctor, I need a psychologist, I need a guru, I need a— oh, I need a cathedral, I need all kinds of things. And the reality is that ain't none of that stuff going to help you. You're going to have to do it yourself. And so the next point is, is that, well, can I do it myself? The magical thinking is, oh no, I can't do it by myself. I'm too stuffed up. My childhood was too miserable. I've got too much PTSD. I mean, that birth canal was quite a trip and I never got over it. And so this is the way that we normally have the magical thinking. But the reality is, is that every one of us can clean out our own mind, and nobody else can do that for you. No one can clean out your mind. Only you can do that, and you can only do that when you remember to do it. And so that's the whole practice right there. And this is all about the doubt. So we have that first level of doubt is, who's going to do this for me? The second level of doubt is, am I up to the task. The third level of doubt is, is that now for sure, because we've been practicing, that we know for a fact that the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths works beyond a shadow of a doubt. This stuff works. And it is stated in the Sutta 24, knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. Knowledge and vision of what is the path is real; what's not the path is all of our magical thinking. And so that's the way that we approach it, is that we have to recognize that we can't figure it out. There's no reason to figure it out. I mean, look how much time and effort the astronomers have. I mean, starting with Copernicus and then Galileo and telescopes, and you've got radio telescopes, and you've got great big mountain telescopes. Mount Palomar, in fact, was a very famous scope because Mount Whitmore, which was in Central California, they got too much light pollution, so they built the Palomar, which, by the way, is very close to Wat Metta. That's how desperate out in the wilderness Wat Metta is is because it's out there where Mount Palomar— guess what? Mount Palomar, they can't use it much anymore because now there's still too much light pollution. So we get a Hubble and then we get a James Webb and there's just no end to it. And guess what? All we need to do is to look up and marvel at how nice the sky is. We don't need any telescopes to do that. We don't need astronomy. We don't need astrology. All we need is to just sit down and be happy. Let us stay ignorant of all of that stuff and figure out what needs to be known. And the only thing that needs to be known is, "Hey, I can remember to wake up, to take a look, to make a change, and congratulate myself." And we keep doing that, and we get into that state called the first Jhana. That's accompanied by happiness, Sukkha, Piti, and is free from the hindrances. And we keep applying and sustaining and applying, sustaining. That's the teaching of the Buddha. We don't need to concentrate on the nose tip, but it's handy if we're going into the higher Jhanas. But the higher Jhanas are, let us say, something like time structuring. You see, in the time of the Buddha, unlike now, In those days, they didn't have television, they didn't have radio, they didn't have cell phones, they didn't have newspapers, they didn't even have writing, they didn't have electricity, they didn't have cars to ride around with them. If you didn't have any of that stuff, how miserable would your life actually be? [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] It would be quite good.

**Speaker D:** It would suck for a while, but then it would probably get much better.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that. Say again.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, computers and cars and all that stuff, like it's a lot of fun, but it also, I think for a person living in the time of the Buddha, it would be much easier to go on retreat than for a person nowadays because we're used to so much stimulation.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Exactly. You know, there is a sutta that we can end with. It's in the '80s, I think it's maybe '82, and the story is about deer will go and eat the food that is part of the trap that the hunter sets out. And foolish people will go and eat the food. And in the time of the Buddha, the way that this is stated, it's not a trap that ensnares like a bear trap where you step on it and then it's caught you, but rather it's the food is laced with chemicals so that the deer become drowsy and are easy then to catch. And so then the next statement is, is that, well, there's going to be a few, a new herd of deer that are going to see that and not eat that food, but they still hang around it. And because they hang around it, the deer hunter can still catch them. And that the point is, is that we need to get as far away from that poison food as possible, because the further away we are from it, the less effect it will have on us. Now, in the time of the Buddha, they didn't have hardly any distractions. Basically, the only thing that they needed to do is just take a hike, go into the woods, and nothing's really changed except that you're not around other people. And so now you can begin to practice. Westerners are weighted down and laden up And I would say that the biggest burden that we carry is a clock. Time is money. Look at the clock. You can't be happy now because look at the time. Look at what's going on with the time. I mean, you got work to do. You got to hit 2, 3, 4. You got to go do it. OK, so that's part of it. And the other part of it is, is that look how many tools that we have that help us with time structuring that didn't happen in the time of the Buddha. And so in the time of the Buddha, it was fairly easy to stay away from the things that are actually dangerous, that are poison, that in fact will make us drowsy with desire and wanting things. Cell phones, porn, all kinds of stuff on the internet. I mean, CNBC, MSNBC, and Fox and CNN, they're poisoning your mind on a regular basis if you watch the news. Every one of them's got their own point of view, and they want you to have their point of view, which means that they're poisoning your mind. So another example of that is someone who is on a diet. If they go to the grocery store and they avoid buying the donuts, avoid buying the sugar, avoid buying this, that, and the other thing, then when they come come home, they put the groceries that they bought away. Now tonight I sneak in there, I want to know donuts in the refrigerator, or I can't have a donut, it's not here. Why? I've secluded myself from donuts. Get away from donuts as far as you can if you want to be on a diet. Don't have donuts in the house. If you're trying to quit smoking, don't have cigarettes in the house. If you want to practice Anapanasati, don't have any computers or laptops in the house. Why? Because they will distract you, just like the food. So this is one of the main differences between modern times, is that we've got so many more poison piles of entrapping goodies. And so, it's good to get away from that, good to go on retreat, good to go to a place where they don't have doughnuts under your mattress.

**Speaker D:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] The one I was staying at actually had like a 7-Eleven kind of shop inside the ward. And every day I was like, oh, I'm not going to go in there. I'm not going to have a brownie or whatever. But quite often I would fail. And now I'm wondering, like, is it a good thing that they have such a shop? Because on the one hand, it kind of keeps me going because when I feel really bad, at least I can get something to eat.

**Speaker A:** All right. The answer is that when you go into 7-Eleven, you must seclude yourself from the unwholesome things and buy the wholesome things. And I imagine that a 7-Eleven inside of a wat would have a whole lot of wat-related stuff and not have so much of the garbage that would be in other 7-Elevens.

**Speaker D:** There's a lot of garbage in there.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Got a lot of stuff in there, huh?

**Speaker D:** In fact, I don't know— a lot of garbage.

**Speaker A:** Lot of garbage, okay? So that means that you're going to have to keep yourself secluded from that stuff as best you can, even when it's right in front of you. In fact, it may be in your grocery basket. Can you seclude yourself by putting it back onto the shelf and only buy the stuff that's wholesome and not buy unwholesome stuff? That we could seclude ourselves from the unwholesome. We can do like the Buddhist teaching of the dear, is to stay away from the things that are unwholesome, because the closer we are to them, the more likely we are to jump right in on it. And also look at the way that we structure our time. How do you spend your time? Do you spend your time looking for something to do, looking for entertainment, or do you spend your time being very happy that you don't have to have any entertainment? Anicca, Arahant. You could just sit here, just, ah, this is so nice, I don't have to do anything, I don't have to go anywhere, I don't have to turn that cell phone on, I could just sit here and enjoy the moment.

**Speaker D:** I guess depending on the time, and sometimes it's quite subtle because I will start watching like a Dhamma talk on my phone, but then I'm thinking, do I actually— am I actually learning about the Dharma, or do I just want to have something to watch? So sometimes it's quite subtle.

**Speaker A:** Yes, there's a whole lot of stuff that appears one way. We've been taught that it's that way, and in fact The reality is that it's upside down. It needs to be turned over. An example of that would be a timepiece that has the sand, you know, that it's got an hour— I think they call it an hourglass. All right, okay. Most of the hourglasses can only tell time when you turn it over upside down. Most of the timepiece Most of them, though, have all the sand in the bottom and it's not telling time. And that's just how they are. And people don't bother to say, wait a minute, let's turn this thing upside down. Okay, so this is the way that we can think of the mind too, that we could turn the mind upside down just by remembering that we can turn it upside down. We don't have to figure things out. We don't have to go get what we want. We could just sit here and be happy instead. Now, that's quite turning it around. Then I'm already okay. I don't need that donut. I don't need whatever it is that I'm in 7-Eleven to buy. And so we can begin to recognize that— wait a minute, that teaching about the deer— let's stay as far away from the sensual desires as we can, because then the hunter can't catch us. The hunter doesn't know where we are because we're not around the bait. That's real freedom. Hanging around that bait is dangerous.

**Speaker E:** And hunter is a hindrance in this example.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker E:** The hunter is a hindrance in this example.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. The hunter here is Mara, it's the world, It's the hindrances, it's the unwholesome thoughts. It's an analogy for that hunter, and that the hunter is not out to do the deer any good at all. The 7-Eleven is not out to do you good, Daniel. It's not there to help you. It's there for its own business, to trap you, to get your money, to get your desire. In fact, that 7-Eleven wants you and everybody else in that lot in that store buying stuff. That's what they want. And the same thing with the news organizations, that we have to be careful about what we listen to because everything's got its own agenda. Everything out there is that hunter. And it's better to stay away from the poisoned bait that is set out for us. Now, there's one more sutta in there, and that is the sutta about Rahula, where Rahula was caught telling a lie, because Rahula, the son of the Buddha—I think that he was really quite young then, probably still under the age of 10 years old, and he went out for the afternoon to the store. He went to the supermarket. And while he was there, some of the monks saw him and come back and tell his daddy. And then Rahula gets confronted by it, and he lies to his dad: "Oh, I wasn't out there, I didn't go to that department store. Oh, I wasn't in that 7-Eleven. But in our case, the point is, is that the 7-Eleven itself was unwholesome for Rahula, and he knew it. That's why he was lying about it. If he didn't see anything wrong with being in the 7-Eleven, he said, yeah, Pop, I was in there, I bought all kinds of things, you wouldn't believe how much fun I had in there. But no, he didn't say that. He lied about it. And so the Buddha gave him quite a lesson about lying. That's when he talks about cleaning his bowl, and then he says that a liar is not even worth the droppings that come out of a dirty bowl. And then he throws the stuff into the garbage, and he says a liar is like this garbage. Not worth being around. But the point was in the beginning is, is that Rahula was not where he was supposed to be, if you think about it that way. That in fact, it's not a matter of supposed to, it was the fact that he was in a dangerous place and he could not see the danger until he was confronted with it, and then he lies about it. So you can also do that for yourself too, is to figure out when you're actually there rubbing that poison bait all over your face, about to take a great big bite of it, and say, wait a minute, is this dangerous or what? And then we don't have to eat into it.

**Speaker D:** Well, then I usually see that it's dangerous, and then I take it anyway.

**Speaker A:** Away with it, right? That's what we do, isn't it? We see the danger, but we don't really see the danger, that we lie to ourselves about it. Yeah, it's not that dangerous, I'll get away with it.

**Speaker D:** And that I can convince myself not to do it, but then the thought keeps coming back and back and back, and then eventually I'm like Okay, I'll just get it.

**Speaker A:** Right, this is why we have to practice over and over and over again, is because that poisoned meat looks delightful to us until we begin to see, wait a minute, it causes heedlessness. I'm not really watching what I'm doing. I can't tell the difference between what's wholesome and unwholesome. And when we keep practicing that way, we begin to see, wait a minute, That's unwholesome, let's stay away from it, let's get secluded from it, let's put some distance there. Let's not have those doughnuts in our refrigerator. So does anybody else have anything? I think this is a good time to stop. What do you think, Martin? Have you gotten something out of this talk today?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was great, thank you. And that's important, I think, that we apply what we read and what we see in the sutta to what we do in our daily life. And so it's very great to be around people that are that are having the same objective and that are willing to share even their mistakes. So, that's great. Thank you all.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. DJ, I'm really glad to see you again. I've been getting a good report from your work on Saturday. Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's been a joy. It's a joy showing up here too.

**Speaker A:** Axel, I'm glad to see you. So does anybody else have anything to say? Amrit, how about you?

**Speaker E:** Uh, thanks a lot. I got a lot from today's teaching and I will try to apply it now. Axel, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, Daniel, we'll see you later.

**Speaker D:** Uh, just one question, what is the name of the temple again that you— Wat Chulamani, something like that?

**Speaker A:** What temple name?

**Speaker D:** Um, the one in India, he came from a word in Bangkok. It was called— what was the name?

**Speaker A:** Oh, the one that I was talking about, Wat Chulapatthan. In Norteberry. Wat Chula Pathan. Okay, there's that word chula, small. Okay, Wat Chula Pathan, which you can see— maybe you could translate it as the wat that has a little wisdom.

**Speaker D:** I'll take this.

**Speaker A:** All right, guys.

**Speaker D:** All right. Thank you so much.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, centers on a core principle: **the mind's tendency to create and then struggle with "tangles" of thought, and the radical solution of simply letting them be.**

Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### Core Analogy: The Tangled Cord
The talk begins with an analogy of a tangled telephone cord. The instinctive approach is to painstakingly pick at the knots (overthinking, analyzing), which often makes it worse. The effortless solution is to **hold it up and let gravity unwind it naturally**. This symbolizes the mind's ability to untangle itself when we stop forcing it.

### Main Teaching: Stop "Figuring It Out"
*   **The Problem:** Our societal conditioning and survival instinct create a powerful **desire to know and figure things out**. We apply this to meditation and inner states, trying to intellectually "untangle" our doubts, past traumas, and existential questions (like "who am I?" or the nature of anatta). This struggle itself *becomes* the problem—it's the hindrance of restlessness and doubt.
*   **The Solution:** The practice is **not about figuring things out, but about observing**. Instead of engaging with the tangle, we can:
    1.  **"Just drop it":** Like cutting the Gordian Knot, we can immediately let go of the problem. We recognize, "I don't need to solve this to be happy right now."
    2.  **Change Direction:** Tangles are created by habitual, unwholesome patterns of thinking. By cultivating wholesome thoughts (gladdening the mind, relaxing), we spin in the opposite direction and the tangles unwind on their own.
    3.  **Be Happy Amidst the Mess:** We can learn to be content and relaxed even when mental or situational "messes" are present. We don't need to fix them first.

### Practical Application to Meditation (Anapanasati)
*   The goal is **happiness and gladdening the mind in the present moment** (the first jhana), not achieving special states or intellectual insights.
*   **Doubt** ("Am I doing this right?") is a major hindrance. The answer is to stop trying to "figure out" the perfect technique and instead just relax and enjoy the breath.
*   **You already have enough to be happy.** The practice is remembering to: 1) Wake up (be aware), 2) Look at what's causing stress (dukkha), 3) Make a change (let go), and 4) Congratulate yourself.

### Additional Insights from the Discussion:
*   **On Teachers & Tradition:** Dhammarato shares his journey through various teachers (Hindu gurus, Goenka) before finding his primary training with Achan Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in Thailand. He distinguishes Achan Po's Zen-like, present-moment "stick" (words like "Not sure" and "Tathagata") from Buddhadasa's more scriptural approach.
*   **On Buddhist Texts:** He criticizes the later commentarial tradition (like the *Visuddhimagga*) for overcomplicating practice with concepts like intense nose-tip concentration, advocating instead for a return to the simpler instructions in the suttas (awareness of the whole body and breath).
*   **On Modern Challenges:** Today's "poisoned bait" (endless digital stimulation, news, entertainment) is far more potent than in the Buddha's time. The practice requires **seclusion**—consciously distancing oneself from unwholesome stimuli, just as a wise deer avoids a hunter's trap.
*   **On the "Hinayana" Label:** He reframes "Hinayana" (small vehicle) not as an insult, but as the essential, personal practice of paddling your own canoe, which is the foundation for everyone before engaging with the larger community (Mahayana).

### In Essence:
The talk is a powerful exhortation to **stop the exhausting inner labor of problem-solving your mind and to start the simple practice of allowing, observing, and gladdening the heart in the present moment.** Happiness is not the reward for untying all your knots; it is the means by which they dissolve.

### Metaphors and Stories

The talk uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate key points about meditation, mindfulness, and the nature of the mind. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Tangled Headphone/Telephone Cord**
- **Metaphor**: The mind is compared to a coiled or tangled telephone/headphone cord.
- **Key lesson**: Trying to forcefully “untangle” the mind (through overthinking, analysis, or effort) often makes things worse. Instead, if you let it “dangle” (i.e., step back and observe without interference), it will naturally unwind itself.
- **Extended analogy**: Just as gravity helps the phone cord untangle when held up, allowing the mind to settle through gentle awareness does the work for you.

---

### **2. The Gordian Knot**
- **Story**: An ancient legend about a complex, tangled knot that no one could untie until Alexander the Great cut through it with a sword.
- **Key lesson**: Sometimes, instead of trying to unravel mental knots (problems, doubts, overthinking), it’s better to “cut through” them by letting go, dropping the issue, or shifting attention away from solving it.

---

### **3. Psychological Archaeology**
- **Metaphor**: The tendency to dig into past traumas or childhood experiences to “understand” present problems is compared to archaeological excavation.
- **Key lesson**: The Buddha’s approach is not about uncovering “first causes” but addressing what is happening in the present moment. The real issue is often the *attempt* to untangle the past, not the past itself.

---

### **4. “Laying Down Beside Work”**
- **Anecdote**: The speaker’s father said, “I’m not afraid of work. I can lay down beside work and go to sleep.”
- **Key lesson**: We don’t need to solve every problem or figure everything out. We can be at peace even when things are unresolved or messy.

---

### **5. Thicket of Views**
- **Metaphor**: The mind’s tendency to get entangled in questions like “Who am I?” or “What is the self?” is compared to a dense thicket.
- **Key lesson**: Such intellectualizing is a hindrance. Happiness comes from letting go of these questions, not answering them.

---

### **6. Deer and the Poisoned Bait**
- **Story**: From the suttas, deer that avoid poisoned bait set by hunters are safe; those who linger near it are caught.
- **Key lesson**: In modern terms, we should “seclude” ourselves from unwholesome distractions (e.g., excessive news, entertainment, junk food) that poison the mind and hinder meditation.

---

### **7. Hourglass**
- **Metaphor**: An hourglass only works when turned upside down.
- **Key lesson**: Similarly, we can “turn the mind upside down” by shifting from a mode of wanting, figuring out, and consuming to one of contentment, observation, and letting go.

---

### **8. Rahula and the Lie**
- **Story**: The Buddha’s son Rahula lied about visiting a place he shouldn’t have gone to.
- **Key lesson**: We often lie to ourselves about engaging in unwholesome activities. The first step is recognizing the danger and avoiding the “bait” altogether.

---

### **9. Left-Handed vs. Right-Handed Phone Use**
- **Analogy**: Right-handed people twist phone cords in a direction that tangles them; left-handed people naturally twist the opposite way, keeping them untangled.
- **Key lesson**: The mind tangles itself through habitual patterns (unwholesome thoughts). Changing direction toward wholesome thoughts allows it to untangle naturally.

---

### **10. The Telescope vs. the Naked Eye**
- **Metaphor**: Astronomers build bigger telescopes to see further, but we don’t need all that to appreciate the night sky.
- **Key lesson**: We don’t need excessive knowledge or complexity to be happy. Simple awareness and contentment are enough.

---

### **Overall Theme**
The talk emphasizes **non-striving** in meditation: rather than trying to “figure out” the mind, we should observe, let go, and allow natural clarity to arise. The metaphors consistently warn against over-efforting and intellectualizing, pointing instead toward ease, presence, and selective engagement with experience.
