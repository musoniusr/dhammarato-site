### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so Alex, you're asking a question about basically the definition of formal practice, right? And it's actually easy enough to describe. That in fact it's too easy and we keep thinking there's more to it. But in fact, in a way, there is more to it. But that means then that what we say you do, we don't do it. And so we have to keep repeating it over and over again about this is what we have to do. Okay, so Here's part of the question, is that the first thing that we're going to do is to remove hindrances. That's the number one thing. If we can't remove the hindrances, we're not going to make much progress at all. We're going to, in fact, be in Dukkha for a long time. We have to remove the hindrances. So the very basic skills that we need to have then is to recognize this hindrance as a hindrance. So let's define what the word hindrance means first. And what a hindrance is, is anything that is going to prevent you from feeling the way that you want to feel. Anything that's going to prevent you from feeling the way that you want to feel. Okay, so in a way then, part of the removal of the hindrances is to figure out how we want to feel rather than examining how we do feel, because examining how we do feel has Dukkha in it. And now we're going to be kind of overshooting and going for how do I want to feel. Okay, now we actually have a fairly long list of things of the way that people want to feel and have it defined. And when we define those things, people will say, yeah, that's good enough, or that description that you're given is close enough to how I actually want to feel. Okay. And that we can— it's actually then when we describe how we want to feel, it winds up being taught or told in concepts anyway.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So a concept then that the way that we would want to feel would be an expression of on top of the world.

**Speaker B:** Yes, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** To feel like you're on top of the world, right? Not that you own the world, right, but that you're on top of the world. There was actually a song out of the 1950s about that, 'I'm living on top of the world.' Okay, so this whole idea, there's another quality to it. And that quality that I use is, everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. The problem is, is that most people feel suffocated under their pile of dirt. They're like Atlas, carrying their own pile of dirt. And the whole point then, is with the idea of Ayn Rand with Atlas Shrugs, is that we are either under our pile of dirt, we're trying to crawl out of our pile of dirt, which is what Atlas is doing, he's trying to shrug it, or are you going to be just sitting on top of the world, sitting on top of your pile of dirt? This is all a matter of attitude, okay? And that attitude that Atlas has of shrugging it, That's like he's wanting to crawl out. Yes, he hasn't actually set it down. He's still in the process of letting go and setting it down and being on top of the world. Okay, right. So now let's look at it as individual levels. But we've got this kind of idea on top of the world. In fact, I'll add a few things to it. We can also talk about being on top of the world is also being supramundane. Lokottara, exactly, on top of the world. That's what that means, is the knower of the world. Lokottara, being on top of the world. Now, um, later literature really goes strange with that when they say that the Buddha knows the name of every fish. That's not what we're talking about here, okay? That's way, way off into too much concepts. What we're talking about is the knower of the world means I know my world, the world of our senses. That when we talk about the names of fishes and things like that, that's all concept, because all of those fish out there are all concepts. Yes, you don't have a fish in your hand, and if you do, you can name him and then let him go. Hey George, bye-bye. Okay, so we're not talking about that kind of on top of the world. We're talking about the feeling of being released, on top of it all. It's a sense of being a winner. Lokottara, being on top of it. So how do we get to that state? Is there little steps along the way? And so the little steps that we're talking about is, can you feel safe? Can you feel secure? Because you can't be on top of the world if you're not safe and secure. That means that you're still carrying the Atlas's world.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So we have to feel comfortable also. If that world is heavy, then it is not the way we want to feel. We don't want to feel like our world is heavy. We want to be on top of the world and not under it. So we need to feel comfortable, safe, secure, and comfortable. You've heard me talk about this before. And then we get from that, we get to the level of satisfied, that I am satisfied with my world, which means now I'm on top of it. I've got a handle on the situation. I know what's going on. This is the basic feeling of being out of Dukkha, because Dukkha is that burden, the world we're carrying, all of our crap, which means that we're the emperor. Yeah, but we're buried under all of the weight of all of our world. Right, so this is all speaking in concepts, but if we talk to ourselves in the sense of, yeah, I can feel safe and secure— this is part of the reason why it's actually important that the Buddha talks about getting into seclusion, because when we're around other people, we don't feel safe. I know for sure the way that students feel when they're in their meditation classes or in those retreats: am I doing it right? Am I sitting up properly? Who's looking at me? I wish that woman would stop coughing. I wish that girl would take off some of her clothing. I wish that girl would put more clothing back on, you know. And so here's all of this stuff that we have, and the Buddha doesn't talk about it in the sense of going to retreat where you're not really in seclusion, to actually go to the woods. That in fact, I highly recommend to the Westerners that if you're going to spend some money on a retreat, go get some camping gear. For $200 or $300, you can get tents and sleeping bags and all kinds of stuff, and then you've got everything you need to go off in the woods so that you can feel safe and secure and comfortable. Perfect. Okay, that's the way that we're looking at it, is to go away. Now, we can also— not just to the woods, but to an empty hut, an empty room, are just in a safe parking lot. I mean, there are some places that you can park your car and sit and feel comfortable and safe, and in other places, no. Okay, an example of that is a McDonald's parking lot. You wouldn't feel safe and secure, but perhaps a Walmart would be okay. Yes, some church parking lots would be a good place to park your car, and other churches would not be a good place to park the car. Need some wisdom with that, okay? But we got to find a place that's actually physically in reality safe, right? We have to create that reality. Why? Because how could we feel safe if we haven't created a reality of safe? So when we know that we're safe and secure, then we can talk ourselves into actually feeling safe. And secure. Because the reality is, is that we are safe and secure, right? This is an important point now. So this is the preliminaries, but now let's get back to the hindrances. Once we're sitting down, we have to make sure that none of the thoughts that we're having are going to be thoughts of, am I safe or not? And change those into, certainly, of course I'm safe. I planned this well, and this is safe and secure. Wow, I'm glad that I'm secure. Okay, that, that, that in fact, that's the whole point of these five hindrances, is that we don't feel safe and secure when we're in the hindrances. Now, one of the things that you mentioned, and in fact this whole preliminary thing that I've been talking about for the past 15 minutes or so, is the hindrance of doubt. Does not make us feel safe and secure. Asking questions about how I'm supposed to practice is not practicing. Yes, it's making us feel insecure because I don't know what I'm doing. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So we can have full faith in the teachings of the Buddha yet still have doubt as a hindrance arise?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Because that full faith is not really full yet. We have to practice it to make it full.

**Speaker B:** Understood.

**Speaker A:** And so we want to know, and that's part of our society, we want to get it right the first time. We want to make sure that we're getting it right. Guess what? That doesn't happen. Got it.

**Speaker B:** That's not how we learn.

**Speaker A:** That's not how we learned. But what we can do then is say, okay, well, I am going to be on guard for making myself feel insecure by asking questions about how to practice, because I already know how to practice. It's a very simple thing to do, is to stop doubting what I'm doing and just enjoy it instead. And we have to keep doing that over and over again, because all of those doubts, all of those worries, all that restlessness, and all all of that agitation will keep coming back because we're in the habit of being in that state. And in fact, part of the waking up process that happens within Anapanasati is more Dukkha, not less. Why? Because if you don't know that you're in Dukkha, then you're kind of not in Dukkha, it's underneath, it's sort of like Um, being uncomfortable. Here's a— here's an excellent example. You've been eating in bed and you've got bread— you've got not breadcrumbs but cracker crumbs. Okay, and here you are laying in bed getting comfortable, and you can begin to feel those cracker crumbs after a while. They're no longer comfortable because they're giving us that data. Okay. And so what we have to do then is to move up just a little bit and brush those cracker crumbs out of the bed. A very worst-case scenario would be sitting in a chair and there's a shoe in the chair and you're sitting on that shoe. Okay, well, that's not going to take you very long to figure out that that shoe is there, but it could be something else. Okay. Like maybe a small screwdriver. Or a piece of wood or whatever. We sit down, we don't quite notice it. But after a while, we recognize that that's there. We need to do something about it. That's also the hindrances, is that we will start in hindrance and not recognize them as hindrance. But then we do recognize it as hindrance. And so now we wind up having to sweep the bed out really, really often.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I got it. Okay, because you keep seeing this stuff come up in a way that you didn't see it before. But now that we're getting peaceful and quiet and comfortable, now we're beginning to look, well, where is the discomfort now? And it's layer after layer after layer after layer of stuff that keeps coming up. That's— and so every time that it does, we gotta eventually see it and then throw it out. The doubts, one at a time, throw them out. I'm okay, I don't have to know that answer is the way to handle the doubt. I don't need that answer. I've already got everything I need to be happy and comfortable. I don't have to have an exact practice. Okay, wanting to do it right is a hindrance. Enjoying that it's good enough is correct practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I can see that.

**Speaker A:** And so that's what we do, just keep coming back. Am I comfortable? Am I safe? Am I secure? Am I satisfied? And.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, the core teaching is about **the purpose and method of formal meditation practice, centered on removing hindrances by cultivating a specific, positive feeling.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Goal of Practice: "On Top of the World"**
The ultimate aim is to cultivate a feeling of being **"on top of the world" (lokuttara)**—a sense of release, lightness, and being a "winner," not burdened by your problems. This is the opposite of feeling like "Atlas," crushed under the weight of your own world (dukkha).

**2. The Essential First Step: Remove Hindrances**
Progress is impossible without removing the five hindrances. A hindrance is defined simply as **"anything that prevents you from feeling the way you want to feel."**

**3. The Method: Cultivate the Feeling You Want**
Instead of analyzing your current negative state (which is dukkha), you should focus on generating the positive feeling you desire. The talk outlines a progressive feeling to cultivate:
*   **Safe & Secure:** This is the foundational step. If you don't feel safe, you cannot be "on top of the world."
*   **Comfortable:** Your world (body, mind, situation) should not feel heavy.
*   **Satisfied:** This indicates you have a "handle on the situation" and are moving out of dukkha.

**4. Practical Application: Create the Conditions**
To feel safe and secure, you must **create a physically safe and secluded reality**. The Buddha's advice on seclusion is emphasized. Examples given include going to the woods, an empty room, or a safe parking lot (e.g., a church, but not a McDonald's). This external security allows you to internally talk yourself into feeling safe.

**5. Key Hindrance Addressed: Doubt**
A major part of the discussion focuses on **doubt** (e.g., "Am I doing this right?"). The teacher makes crucial points:
*   Doubt is a hindrance because it makes you feel insecure.
*   Asking questions about *how* to practice is often not practicing; it's a manifestation of doubt.
*   The antidote is to **stop doubting and just enjoy the practice**. "Wanting to do it right is a hindrance. Enjoying that it's good enough is correct practice."
*   Faith in the teachings isn't full until you practice it.

**6. The Process of Awakening Brings More *Initial* Dukkha**
As you become more peaceful and quiet, you become more sensitive to subtle discomforts and hindrances (like feeling crumbs in a bed you didn't notice before). You see "layer after layer" of dukkha you must clear out. The practice is a continuous process of recognizing hindrances and "throwing them out."

**In essence:** Formal practice is not a complex technique, but the simple, repeated act of setting up a safe space, settling the mind by removing hindrances (especially doubt), and actively cultivating a progressive feeling of safety, comfort, and satisfaction until you reach a sense of being unburdened and "on top of the world."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the concepts of formal practice and hindrances:

**1.  The Primary Metaphor: Being "On Top of the World"**
*   This is the central, positive goal state. It represents feeling released, victorious, and free from burden (Dukkha). The speaker clarifies it does not mean owning or controlling the world, but rather having a transcendent, "supramundane" (Lokottara) perspective on it.

**2.  The Contrasting Metaphor: The Pile of Dirt / Atlas**
*   **Emperor of a Pile of Dirt:** This story illustrates the human condition. Everyone has their own "world" (pile of dirt), but the problem is one's relationship to it.
*   **Atlas Shrugging:** The speaker references the mythological figure Atlas (and Ayn Rand's novel) to describe the common state of suffering. Most people feel like **Atlas**, crushed *under* the weight of their world, trying to "shrug" it off. The goal is to stop carrying the burden and instead sit *on top* of the pile as its emperor. This shift from under the weight to on top of it is framed as a "matter of attitude."

**3.  The Sensory Metaphor: Physical Discomfort as Hindrance**
*   **Crumbs in the Bed:** This is used to explain how hindrances become noticeable. When you first lie down, you might not feel the crumbs. Only as you get still and seek comfort do you become aware of the subtle irritants. Similarly, as meditation brings peace, subtler layers of mental "discomfort" (hindrances like doubt) become apparent and must be "brushed out."
*   **Sitting on an Object:** The example of sitting on a shoe, screwdriver, or piece of wood reinforces the same idea. A hindrance might not be obvious at first, but over time, its disruptive presence is felt and must be removed.

**4.  The Practical Story: Creating a Safe Physical Space**
*   The speaker tells a pragmatic story about applying the teaching. To feel safe and secure (a prerequisite for being "on top of the world"), one must create that reality physically. The recommendation is to avoid crowded retreats where social anxiety arises ("am I doing it right?") and instead go into true seclusion—like the woods with camping gear, an empty room, or a wisely chosen safe parking lot (e.g., a Walmart or certain church lots, but not a McDonald's). This story grounds the abstract goal in a practical, actionable step.

**In summary, the metaphors work together:**
The **Atlas/pile of dirt** metaphor describes the problem of suffering.
The **"on top of the world"** metaphor describes the goal of release.
The **crumbs/shoe in the chair** metaphors describe the process of recognizing and removing hindrances that keep us under the pile.
The **practical advice about seclusion** is a story about creating the external conditions that support the internal shift from burdened to sovereign.
