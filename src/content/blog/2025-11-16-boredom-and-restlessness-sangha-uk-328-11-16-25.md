**Speaker A:** All right, friends, welcome. This is Sunday afternoon in Thailand, Sunday morning in the UK, and today we're going to be talking about the hindrances, the five hindrances, and how the hindrances actually hinder us being in the state of mind and in the state of feeling that we want to be in. That in fact, the hindrances is a universal human situation that was in the time of the Buddha, and that you could say that the hindrances are in fact part of the primary teachings of the Buddha. And yet Most people will perhaps learn the Five Hindrances, but they never learn how to actually apply it. It stays as kind of book learning and it doesn't have much value. And then when it's time to practice, they don't know how to deal with the hindrances. And so today We'll talk about how to deal with the hindrances. Now, there's not a lot of verbiage to it, but it's much more a situation of repeated application over and over and over again, and that the value comes in being able to see the hindrances. Now, recently someone posted that Arahant Samatha had said something about welcoming these hindrances. Now, I wouldn't use the word welcoming because welcoming has quality of if they're not there, we want them to come in. But It's not that we want them to come in, it's that can we see them when they do come? The example that I would use would be a mouse in the house. That let us say that a new mouse has come into the house and we don't have any evidence. We just have suspicions, maybe some scratching here and there, and that once we see the mouse, Then we say, aha, now I see you. If whenever you see the mouse in the house and you say, oh no, we've got mice, that's the wrong attitude. You want to have the attitude that, yeah, I'm really glad that I can see that mouse because now that I know for sure he's here, I could do something about it. Now, several years ago, we had two dogs, a mother and a daughter. One named Poonpui and the other one was Lucky, and they were mousers, except that they were very noisy about it. And I don't think that they ever caught a mouse, but they would make a huge ruckus in the kitchen, not just barking, but tearing into things and doing whatever they could to catch the mouse. And I think that they scared them all off. But after we lost Lucky and Poonpui, the mice would come. Now we've got cats, and cats do it completely differently. They don't make a lot of ruckus chasing the mice, they just catch them, and then they make a ruckus by playing with the mouse. And so this is the style that we want to develop, is not the style of the dogs making a big fuss about it when they find a mouse, but doing it the way that the cat does it. We just see that mouse and we catch it. So we're not welcoming these hindrances, but what we are is going to be on guard for them in order to be able to see them. Now, there is a list of 5 in most suttas, but some suttas have a much longer list, and in the longer list they have things like fear, which is a hindrance. It's a major hindrance, in fact, and I'm surprised that it didn't make it in the top 5. But you can see, in fact, that in the top 5 you have the hindrance of doubt. Well, doubt is not just a second cousin, it's a twin of fear, that if you don't know, then, uh, there is the fear of the unknown. And so doubt almost always brings up fear, and that is quite common and quite possible for somebody to have the hindrance of doubt and not know it. They don't know it. Why did they not know it? It's because, one, it's a familiar territory. They think they know what's there when in fact they're not really doing a clear investigation. Another hindrance, and the one that we're going to speak on today, is the hindrance of restlessness. Now, the word restlessness in the translation— actually, we use different language in English. We don't use the word restless or restlessness. That's a very uncommon word to use. What we normally use is the word boredom. But boredom and restlessness are basically the same thing. Now there's akin to that, or a twin to restlessness and boredom, and that is worry. In fact, you could go so far as to say that worry is the primary hindrance. This is why it's so commonly said, "Don't worry, be happy." because the "don't worry" is actually referring to all of the hindrances. Because when we're worried, generally that means that we want something that we don't have, which is another hindrance— wanting something that we don't have. In fact, a good example of that is what is called the Vipassana romance. Has anybody here ever heard of the Vipassana romance? Okay, this happens in retreats where people go. Sometimes they dress in special clothing, in white pants and white tops, and they go to these retreats and they separate the men and the women. The women are nearly looking at the altar, are on the left, and the men are on the right. And sometimes they reverse that, doesn't really matter. It does to the Hindus because they're very superstitious, by the way. But in Thailand, they don't much care. And so the Vipassana romance is that the young man, he has seen one of the young ladies in the retreat and now He's got a plan. And so he plans and he plans and he worries about introducing himself and what he's going to say to her. And he waits until the last day when the silence is over and he goes looking for her, only to find that she left the retreat early. That's the thoughts of the romance. What happened with that was, is that instead of practicing correctly, he's planning and scheming because he wants that girl, he's actually worrying about that girl, he's spending a lot of time, and you could also say that he's quite restless about it. Now we can take an opposite example of that, and that is that we've got a retreat in such situation, and there's somebody in there who is ill, and they're coughing a lot. And when that person coughs, A lot of the other people, they don't like it. They want him to shut up, or he's restless and moving around and making a lot of noise, and everybody gets irritated by that. Which means then that when the people are wanting something, when they are restless, when they are worried about something, or when they're annoyed by somebody's behavior, All of those are excellent opportunities to not practice. And yet the correct practice would be to see, aha, that copying is there, can't bother me. Okay, so this is what Ajahn Samadhi means by to welcome those hindrances. But he's not talking about welcoming in the sense of creating them anew, going out and shopping for them, hoping to catch a new hindrance, but rather to deal with the hindrances that do come up in a healthy, wholesome fashion. How do we do that? Well, the Buddha had a term that he used And in fact, there's an entire section in the Samyutta Nikaya. I think it's number 22, but I'm not sure. And in that section is when a lot of Mara comes, one sutta per session of Mara. And in all cases, the Buddha would say, aha, I see you. I'm not welcoming you exactly, but I am really glad that I can see you, just like we would be really glad to see that mouse. We've been suspecting that there's a mouse, and now when the mouse shows up, I got you. So that's the same is true then with these hindrances, is that we are not out shopping for new ones, but we are on alert for the new ones when they come up. Because they will. In fact, you could say that the average ordinary mind is actually dealing with one hindrance or another with every thought that they have. And so these hindrances should be actually fairly easy to catch. The question is, is can you catch it and label it? Aha, I see you. And as we label that hindrance, you possibly even could go so far as to say, "Aha, I see you boredom. Aha, I see you restlessness. Aha, I see you worry. Aha, I see you doubt. Aha, I see you wanting something that you don't have"— the Vipassana romance— "or aha, I see that guy making a lot of noise and I don't like it." Okay, so these would be the five hindrances. But like I said, there's a longer list in some suttas, but these are enough. That's enough, in fact, to annoy you right through an entire retreat, as well as leg pains and other things like that. New situations. I mean, people who go to retreats for the first time would do the whole retreat with hardly ever having any correct practice going on. Throughout the entire retreat, which kind of makes the retreats not only expensive but irrelevant. In fact, you could go so far as to say, because a lot of people say, oh, I did a retreat and it was hard, which meant that they're actually adding the Dukkha to their, uh, self rather than gaining liberation from from it, which reminds me of Sutta number 22 in the Majjhima Nikaya, which is referred to as the snake simile, where the Buddha talks about someone who is catching a snake. If they catch it in the wrong place, it'll turn around and bite them. Now, snake handlers, they know how to handle snakes in almost every way possible. And still not get bitten by the snakes. But a whole lot of snake handlers think that they know that snake pretty well now, and then they wound up getting bit anyway. So the way to actually catch a snake is by the top of the throat so that he can't open his mouth. If a snake can open his mouth, he can bite you. So We can actually then take that as the simile for the Dharma. If you grab the Dharma by the wrong end, or even by the throat but not high enough on the throat, if the Dharma can open its mouth, it's going to bite you. This is a sutta of the Buddha. I didn't make this up. So take it seriously. If you grab the Dharma by the wrong end, If you don't grab it carefully enough, it's going to bite you. And so basically what we're saying then is, is that the right way to catch the snake is by dealing with the hindrances correctly, because if we don't grab these hindrances right by the throat, they're going to bite you. That's why they're called hindrances, is because— or obstructions is another word that's used. They're obstructing your ability to be happy right now. And so correct practice is actually the correct practice of being on guard for these hindrances, and that we want to remember to be on guard for these hindrances. And another use of the word for the guarding would be investigation. So remember to look, remember to investigate. Now I'll take a point, and that is, is that many people when they hear Right Noble View, they think that it's a viewpoint. And the Buddha mentions two opposite viewpoints. One is nihilism and the other one is eternalism. And generally One person or another is caught in one of those two extremes. But the real right noble view is actually not a view in the traditional sense of a concept, a worldview, or a way of looking, but rather it is actually looking. To look directly at what the mind is doing. Directly at what the body is doing. Look directly at what the feelings are doing. Look directly at what kind of mind state that you have. These are the four areas of investigation, because we have the ability— once we see what's going on, we have the ability to do something about it. Once you have seen that mouse, now you have let us say, the determination to do something. If you kind of suspect that there may be a mouse here, but you have no evidence, you're not likely to go get a trap. But if you've seen that mouse, you know he's there, then you're going to, like the cat, lay in wait or get a trap and trap that mouse. This is an important quality then, is that you can see these hindrances We can see then that these hindrances, whichever one this is, is in fact a form of Dukkha in the mind right then and there. And that in the sutras it talks about that the Dukkha is a prerequisite for commitment, for determination. In other words, if you can't see that hindrance as a hindrance, you're not probably going to do anything about it. But if you can see that hindrance as hindrance, then you will become determined to do something about it. This is an important quality. You have to become determined to change, because if you don't have the determination, you're not going to take the right noble view to actually do the change. So we have to be on guard with these hindrances. Now, one of the hindrances that was mentioned recently is the hindrance of restlessness and worry, which was spoken of in the form of boredom. Now, boredom has the quality of being, let us say, dissatisfied with the way things are right now. And if you can see yourself as bored, you could do something about it. Now, the ordinary mind that does something about it says, oh, I'm bored. Let me play a game on my cell phone. Let me have some sort of challenge. 'Let me do something so that by doing it, I take my mind off of the boredom.' And guess what? The boredom keeps coming back over and over again. In fact, you can go play a game because you're bored, and while you're playing the game, you get bored with the game because it's taking too long. You wanted the challenge that you could win. You want that good feeling of winning the game. But you don't want to play the easy version. You want to play the hard version so that you can win and get a big benefit from it. So these hindrances actually are best dealt with by dealing with them, each one by its opposite. An example would be that if you're tired and sleepy, then we want to practice in an energetic way. So that means that if you're tired or sleepy, then you would do it by not becoming peaceful and quiet. Instead, what you would do is you would rouse your energy by doing the investigation and making the changes. But with boredom Basically what that means is that you're actually kind of putting yourself to sleep, and that the right way to deal with boredom and restlessness is— in fact, with restlessness as the primary word that we're looking at— is rest, peace. So you don't go, when you're bored, to go challenge yourself. Instead, what you would do is you would practice relaxing. Everything is all right. This moment is in fact good enough. Aha, I see you, restlessness, and I'm going to put that restlessness to rest. This is the way that we would deal with restlessness, is by being peaceful, calm, take a deep breath, Relax. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. This is the way that we would deal with restlessness. How would we deal with Vipassana romance? Is changing the subject, getting away from that. Don't put any energy into that. Put energy back into the correct practice. So these various hindrances have various tools. You could say that what is the antidote for doubt again is investigation. Look closely, look, because if you look, you can see. If you can see, then you don't have that doubt anymore about what you see. You can see that, aha, doubt is a hindrance. Once we see that doubt as a hindrance, we can say, "Oh, I'm just making myself afraid because I don't quite understand about how to practice, but I can practice correctly anyway because I know how." And how do we do that? By start having wholesome thoughts that will in fact change that doubt into everything is okay, not a problem in the world. I see that doubt. Aha, I caught you. And now I can relax. Now, once we have the ability to do that, that generally means that we can change our state of mind, we can change our attitude. We do that with the thinking, by gladdening the mind with happy, wholesome thoughts. But once we are able to do that over and over and over again, we begin to change our attitude. Now, one of the things about hindrances is that we are— whenever there's a hindrance there, which is almost all the time, we are a victim to that hindrance. But when we change our attitude about the hindrance, the attitude becomes, I can handle that hindrance. I don't have to hide from it. I can deal with it directly. And so we have the right noble attitude. To deal with these hindrances. And by doing so, by changing that attitude from, oh, poor me, I can't deal with these hindrances, into, aha, I can deal with them, guess what? We begin to feel better. The doubt that creates fear kind of melts away so that we begin to feel safe and secure. We begin to feel comfortable. We begin to get results, in fact immediate results. The more you practice, the more immediate the great benefit becomes. So that you begin to feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. Over and over and over again we feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied every time we see that hindrance. We deal with it. So as we do that over and over again, right noble effort then begins to change into the sense of we begin to change that attitude. And that attitude then changes from successful— I mean, from satisfied into feeling successful. That's the real attitude, is that I can do this. No matter what happens, I can catch those hindrances and I can deal with them. Now, the Buddha in Sutra 48, in the Kasambhyan Sutta, talks about the hindrances that I've just talked about. And then he makes a statement that once one comes to the point that no matter what kind of hindrance is there, No matter how obstructed the mind is, we have the attitude because it's been developed. We have the attitude of I can deal with this no matter what hindrances there are. I can throw that hindrance out and come back and feel good. I can actually see things the way that they actually are, rather than seeing things through the filter of my old poor me. From the hindrances. So this is the value that in fact the Buddha says that this state of mind, when we have that right noble attitude, in Nepali is Samma Sanghappa, when we have that right noble attitude of I can do this, he says that this is the first step on the path until people change their attitude from, oh, poor me, Those hindrances are too much for me. Let me go do this, that, and the other thing because I can't deal with the hindrance into that state of I can deal with this. I have dealt with it so many times before. I am successful now at dealing with this. And the Buddha says that this is the first step on the Noble Path. He also says that this attitude is a noble attitude. It's not a poor me, it's not a victim's attitude, it's a winner's attitude. He also says that developing this way is actually a part of the path. Then he says, as the last one, is that most ordinary people do not have this quality. Most people are a victim to their hindrances. But when we develop through right noble view into right noble effort, into right noble change of attitude, where we feel good and we have the noble attitude, that's actually a step onto the Noble Path. Congratulations. Congratulations, you're on the path now. So This is actually the way that we can look at these hindrances, is that they are something that we want to be able to see so that we can do something about them. And then we take the effort to do something about it. And when we do take some— take the right noble effort to do something about these hindrances, that means that we begin to brighten the mind for sure. You begin to have that winner's attitude. And in fact, this would be the time that we could say it's time to congratulate yourself. You can do this. You can deal with that hindrance, whatever the hindrance is, especially boredom. You can see, aha, I see you, boredom, and I'm not bored now simply because I can see you. I can take a deep breath and say everything right now is okay, okie dokie. Wow, what an improvement that is over being bored. So does anybody have any questions about this? Amrit, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So Dhammarato, once I was listening to a talk by Arahant Brahm, and he was saying that the hindrance are actually— it's a relation between your mind and your experience. And if you change the relation, then the hindrance is also kind of— you are changing the hindrance. And I think this is also what you are saying here, right? So if I change my attitudes to a hindrance, then it's not a hindrance at all.

**Speaker A:** I would go so far as to say that the hindrances, by the time that you're adults, is just an old habit. And so it's an old habit way of dealing with the world. And so now, in fact, what that actually means is, is that we have become numb to them. The house— your house is full of mice and you haven't bothered to check to see that you can catch them. You can see that mouse, because if you can't see it, you can't catch it. So this is, uh, I wouldn't say it's a relationship between the mind and the world. It's not at all. In fact, it's what the mind is doing, no matter what the world is doing. You could be in a parade and be bored. You could be at your own execution and be bored. "Will you get on with it already?" So it's not the situation that creates the hindrance. It's the mind that creates the hindrance out of old habits. Does that make sense for you, Amrit?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely it does.

**Speaker A:** So, Katherine, do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** I think that rings really true for me. I definitely like the analogy of having the house full of mice that I just haven't bothered to do anything about. But I do have like an attitude that I can do something about it. I can change. I mean, change is inevitable anyway, but I can change in a positive way. But I just need to guard against, you know, that conditioning, that laziness of just, okay, just carry on as before and let everything distract me. You know, I can be much more proactive than I am really about clearing my house up.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the encouragement that I want to give, is to give you the encouragement that once you begin to see these hindrances, and when you really do see them, that gives you the energy, the effort, the determination, the conviction to do something about it. Because it's the fact that we don't really see— we get used to the way things are, and so we kind of piddle and puddle our way through life. Full of unhappy moments rather than being able to do something directly about it. So Agnes, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much. A great teaching. It's been with me for a long time and it changed my life. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** So Mr. Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** Great talk. Thanks, Dhammarato. Yeah, the amount of effort compared to the amount of benefit is really— the amount of effort is really small compared to the amount of benefit that one can get when they actually put in the little bit of right effort needed to change.

**Speaker A:** A little bit of right effort gains great benefit. But you won't ever know that. In fact, everybody is going to say— when I— when they hear me say that, they're going to doubt it. Why? It's not going to be that good. Why should I bother? And so they're already got doubt. That— in fact, I will say this, Ben, and that is, is that that point that I just made is the main reason why so few people actually do benefit from the Dharma, is because of their doubt that they're going to get any benefit out of it. And so they don't try it, they don't see. And so congratulations to each one of you by actually doing the practice, because you're not going to see the benefit until you do the practice. That's like watching the stock market but not owning the stock. You can see it go up and up and up, or up and down, or whatever, but you don't own it, so you're not gaining any benefit from it because you're not doing it. Don't have skin in the game, so to speak. So right noble practices actually putting the effort in so that you can actually get the benefits from it. And I assume, Mr. Ben, from what I've seen from you, you've actually been practicing and gaining those benefits. Is that not true?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Let'S hear some enthusiasm from you then.

**Speaker D:** It is really, really beneficial, but as you say, you don't know until you try it. Yeah, I remember the first time I sort of practiced, I was like, oh, I actually had immediate benefit, and that was what kept me interested. Kept me watching the videos, kept me practicing. And then, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** If you do something and you don't get any benefit of it, the likelihood of you doing it more is less. Then in fact, you could say that there's two kinds of people in the world who start to practice meditation and they don't get anything out of it. One kind of person is just going to quit and the other one is being determined. I'm going to get something out of this no matter what. And so they work really, really hard and they still don't get any benefit out of it. And so then they really work hard and they still don't get anything out of it. Why? Because they're not practicing correctly. And what is that? Actually, you practice in order to get the benefit out of it. So practicing and not getting any benefit out of it is wrong practice. Correct practice is doing it and getting the benefit immediately. And then we can say, aha, I can see that too. I can see those hindrances, and then I can take the noble effort to remove them, to take those unwholesome thoughts out and have wholesome thoughts in. And then I can see the benefit and the result. So, Amrit, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, I am definitely getting a lot of benefits. I think this means I am also practicing correctly, and thanks a lot. And I see this very well with the talk from the last last Sunday. Last Sunday you said that first we have to see the suffering and then we gladden the mind and then there will be a power to this gladdening the mind. If you do it without seeing the suffering, then there won't be much power. So this is like what you said today is seeing the hindrance first.

**Speaker A:** That's right.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so that will help each one of you to redouble your effort and your benefit is because you're looking for those hindrances, you're looking for that Dukkha. We're not welcoming it, but we're happy to see it, because then we could do something about it.

**Speaker B:** So we are welcoming the seeing of.

**Speaker D:** It.

**Speaker A:** So Christina, what do you think?

**Speaker E:** I had a question. Something came up today that came up in the US Sangha call, and it was about having like an eternalist or a nihilist view point. And I guess I liked the distinction that you made today about viewpoint being a concept rather than really the right view. And something that I'm trying to figure out how to handle is when talking to someone about, you know, what, for example, like what the meaning of life is. And if my response is, you know, that question's irrelevant, There's, there's like a.

**Speaker A:** Lot of results and feed that back to them. What you need to do, okay, is again, and in fact a good place to begin with that is, uh, ask them the question, do you know for sure? If they're an eternalist, you can say, do you know And they'll have to admit that they don't know.

**Speaker E:** Okay. Yeah, because it creates friction.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker E:** No, yeah, because it creates friction, and then I feel like I have to kind of work through, and then doubt comes up for me.

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker E:** Okay, yeah. Arya. I like that.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you. Because that will actually work for everyone who is going to be honest with you. Now, a lot of people will say, well, I don't know for sure, but I believe. And there, that's, that's a cop-out. So you go back again to them and says, but you don't know, you just believe. And keep hammering on that point about they don't know. And then you can go to the next step: nobody knows. Nobody knows, because that's what makes it irrelevant, is the fact that nobody knows. If half the people in church knew that God exists and half of the people don't know that God exists, then you got no place to go. But the reality is, is that nobody knows God exists or not. They've got no evidence, and that's what makes gods irrelevant. That's what makes rebirth and reincarnation and going to heaven and going to hell irrelevant, is because nobody knows now. And if nobody knows now, all we have to deal with is what we do know about what is right now. So let's deal with right now, right now. And let's not deal with things that we have no clue about. That's why they're irrelevant. It's irrelevant only because it's not here now. Let's deal with what's here now. Does that help you with that?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, absolutely. Yes, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good. I'm glad we got that straightened out. Karwan. Hello, Karuna. Hello, Dhammarato. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** Good, good. I'm just enjoying it, Dhammarato. Not much to say. Yeah, just practicing being okay, practicing being satisfied, and practicing acting and feeling like I am.

**Speaker A:** Yes, just being here now. That's all there is to it. So, Yanis, did I answer your question?

**Speaker F:** I'm still very much confused because it's, yeah, like that attitude of not being bothered. It's like, why should I catch the mouse? Why am I bothered by the mouse? Why can't I just let the mouse? Be in the house. That's, that's what makes me— what this makes me think.

**Speaker A:** You'll think about it differently when that mouse ruins your supper, when that mouse chews the cord to the refrigerator, when, when you actually see the damage. So you haven't seen the damage yet. You're not seeing the Dukkha.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, because like the question that I had is like, okay, the boredom is what makes me bring the mouse inside the house, but then it's like maybe I'm handling the practice wrong, like I'm holding the Dharma wrong, like you mentioned of Sutta number 32, and I'm like saying, oh, I should not be bothered by a mouse being in the house, you know, like wanting to get rid of the mouse. Is an unwholesome thought. That's pretty much what I do. It's like I get myself in these situations out of boredom and then I stay there.

**Speaker A:** An analogy, and I'm using the analogy for the mouse in the house is dangerous. It's unwholesome. It's dangerous because the mice may be polluted with some illness and it bites you.

**Speaker F:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So let's look at that mouse as something that's dangerous and unwanted in the mind. The boredom is in the mind and it's dangerous because it prevents you from feeling good right now.

**Speaker F:** Yes. But my question was more about what comes after the boredom. It's like the boredom will get me into those situations where like more hindrances come up. It's like I invite the hindrances and then it's like I kind of force myself to stay with them because I'm like, oh, I should be stronger than this. You know, it's like the boredom makes me grab the hot coal.

**Speaker A:** This is okay. So now I'm beginning to understand. So you should get rid of the mouse, you should get rid of the boredom. Is just a rule. Can you see that those rules that you've made are preventing you from dealing with reality correctly, that the rules themselves now have become a hindrance?

**Speaker F:** Maybe that could be it, but I see it more as sometimes the best wholesome action is to just like leave and like leave the situation.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's always the right thing to do, is to go away from that hindrance.

**Speaker F:** Yes, but like going away feels like, oh, I'm just like being weak and giving in. It's like trying to escape the situation.

**Speaker A:** That's— no, if you stayed, that would make you weak because you can't get away from it, you can't deal with it. But if you can get up and go That would be the same as being in an argument with someone. The weak person will stay in the argument. The strong one will leave the argument, because arguments are almost always unwholesome, unsatisfactory, unproductive. Nobody changes their mind in an argument anyway.

**Speaker F:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so getting, getting away from it. So getting away from that hindrance would, uh, of restlessness— the best place to go to get away from it is into peace and quiet. Get rid of the restlessness and go into a state of rest. This is what the Buddha recommends, is become restful. How do you do that? Every time you see a restless thought, you say, aha, I see you, and right now I'm just going to take it easy, I'm going to rest. And pretty soon you can get yourself into a state of rest because it's exactly opposite. But when you say I should be at rest, now you're adding to the Dukkha rather than removing it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and I say that while I'm in argument because, yeah, like the boredom makes me go out and like have an argument, and then the argument makes like other hindrances come up, and I'm like, okay, now I should stay and like surmount all these hindrances that came out instead of like just seeing how I got there and leaving. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** I won't confront you on that, but it— because you're actually now going in the right direction. And the right direction is, is that you can deal with these hindrances by removing them. So you're not leaving them and leaving your mind, you are actually changing your mind and getting rid of the hindrance, which is the way to look at it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** So maybe this is like an example of handling the Dhamma, like holding it in the wrong place, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. You're getting bit by the Dhamma snake because you're making a bunch of rules about what should be.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Rather than saying, oh, I see that hindrance of restlessness, let me just relax. I'm so glad I saw it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, Tim, what do you think?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I think it's just very good news.

**Speaker A:** You can just basically just let go of all hindrances and bad habits and be happy. I think there couldn't be better news. Very good. How about you, Robert Q?

**Speaker G:** Hello, Dhammarato. Thank you. I have one question conceptually. When in sitting practice looking for the differences, thoughts that are like planning in the future, if this would be falling into the restless category versus thoughts that are just like daydreaming, not really planning anything, if that would be more sloth Sloth and torpor, if that's the right understanding.

**Speaker A:** All right, let me give you a rule of thumb, and that is a plan is just a thought, generally, maybe one or two thoughts in a row, like getting this, that, and the other thing. Like, I've got to get my bank book and I've got to get the receipts, and then I'm going to take them to the bank and deposit the money. Okay, so, but the point is, is that how many times do you make that plan? After you've made the plan twice and it's the same plan, and then you have it a third time, now that's beginning to get restless. It's beginning to get worried because you're having the same thought over and over and over again. And so by the time that you wake up, you can say, aha, I see that I'm worried about going to the bank, or I see I'm worried about writing an email to the boss, or I see I'm worried about going to the police to turn in my father because he raped me. Now that one would be someone that gets really worried. You can imagine that people are on big, tough, decent situations like that get a lot of worry in and no results. And so I don't have to think about my dad. I don't have to think about the police because I'm not going to the police about my dad anyway. And I use that as an example because my dad died in 1973, so I don't have to worry about that. So This is the thing. Once you have the same thoughts repeating over and over again, you called it a plan, but now it's just restlessness and worry. It almost might have a bit of boredom into it because you're not satisfied with not going to the bank.

**Speaker G:** Just feels for me like sometimes when I'm sitting The mind is more into planning all the time, can't get silent because I'm planning all the time something. And other times it's also doing something else, but it's not really planning, it's just doing bullshit, just thinking about stuff. And I was wondering if that's like different states of mind that I can then counteract differently.

**Speaker A:** Yes, once you see that, once you see that these are just bullshit thoughts, you can say, I can have better thoughts than that. I can have the thought that everything right now is really great. I can have the thought that, wow, this is so nice. Wow, I could relax. So you can begin to have wholesome thoughts as a counter to all of these restless thoughts. But you're in the habit of having all those restless planning kind of thoughts, and so you're prone to have them. Be on guard for them. So that you can see that in fact they are Dukkha. They are not of any value or benefit. In fact, they are hindrances because they keep you from being relaxed and joyful and playful.

**Speaker G:** Okay. So if I understand correctly, you classify them as restless anyway, both of them, and sloth and torpor would be more sleepiness or you just don't— you just feel without any energy. Okay, thank you. May I add one more question?

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker G:** That is on desire for, I don't know, pleasant sensation that I struggle to get rid of when I'm sitting.

**Speaker A:** Wanting something that you don't have is Dukkha. So wanting pleasant sensations is different than having pleasant sensations. I need to take— In many places, especially Wat Soi Mokkhindipavawan, they will recommend that if you are sitting and the body begins to be unpleasant, then do something about it. Stand up, rub your face with your hands, rub your arms, stand up, walk around, do something to get the body comfortable again. In other words, take the comfort, do the comfort rather than wanting the comfort and doing nothing about it.

**Speaker G:** It's more a problem for comparing, comparing to previous experiences and how it should be right now and letting that go. That's a rule.

**Speaker A:** All you have is right now. Don't compare the past. Compare right now. I can stand up right now. I can feel good right now is the right now kind of feeling, and I don't have to compare it with an old feeling. Then in fact, the likelihood is, is that you will hyperinflate the old feeling. Let us say on a scale from 1 to 10, it was a 4, and here you are at a 2 looking up, and you'll say, wow, that must have been a 10, when nope, it's just a 4.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So don't compare to the past.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just feel good right now.

**Speaker G:** When I see it, it's difficult to let it go completely. I can tell myself, don't compare, don't look back. That's stupid, right? Just be right now.

**Speaker A:** Just be good enough.

**Speaker G:** Some Anagami is craving for that, and that's the tricky thing.

**Speaker A:** Me? So we have Aslanor. Is that how you say your name? Aslanor. Catherine, do you know how to pronounce that name?

**Speaker C:** I think it's Aslan, like the lion in the Narnia books, and then noir for black. Aslan Noir.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Is he on? He may be feeling too good to talk.

**Speaker D:** Sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, I am here.

**Speaker D:** Sorry, I was just trying to— trying.

**Speaker A:** To get your hair good.

**Speaker D:** Mute off. Sorry, was— did you have a question? I was listening, but I didn't hear the question.

**Speaker A:** Yes. What do you have to say about today's talk?

**Speaker D:** Um, I found it very interesting. I didn't have any particular, um, comment about it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so it didn't grab you by the throat and shake you down, huh? All right.

**Speaker D:** No, no, it didn't.

**Speaker A:** Yes, because if you can't see those hindrances, you're not going to do anything about them. So does anybody have any last remarks? Okay, Maki, why don't we take this thing home? Happily.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, so glad to not be bothered by the practice and instead enjoy doing it. Can just, yeah, practice having peace, practice having joy right now. No need to want it. Thanks so much, friends, for being here today. We welcome you to stay on. We welcome you to come back again.

**Speaker A:** Stay on the call.

**Speaker H:** Let's keep hanging out. Dhammarato is going to go lie down, but we can keep chatting for a bit.

**Speaker A:** Yes, make some friends here. Remember that the Buddha and the Dharma are only two out of three, that the Sangha winds up making the Buddha-Dharma work. You have to have friends, noble friends. So I recommend that you have a lot of calls, and in fact you can invite people onto these calls. On the Dharma Friends group.

And we'll see you. Please stay on so that you can connect with each other.

**Speaker E:** Thanks, Dhammarato.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Theme:** The practical application of the **Five Hindrances** (*nīvaraṇā*)—not as mere theoretical knowledge, but as a direct practice for cultivating a happy, peaceful mind.

**Main Teachings:**

1.  **The "Mouse" Analogy:** Hindrances (like doubt, restlessness/worry, desire, aversion, sloth) are like mice in your house. The goal isn't to *welcome* them, but to develop the alertness to **"see" them clearly** when they appear. Seeing them is the first and most crucial step, just as you must see a mouse before you can deal with it.

2.  **Attitude is Key:** The correct attitude is not one of a victim ("Oh no, a hindrance!") but of a capable practitioner ("Aha! I see you. Now I can deal with you."). This shift from a "poor me" to a **"winner's attitude"** is the foundation of Right Intention (*Sammā Saṅkappa*) and the first step on the Noble Path.

3.  **Specific Guidance on Hindrances:**
    *   **Restlessness/Worry/Boredom:** These are presented as essentially the same. The antidote is **calm and peace**. Instead of seeking distraction, practice relaxing, taking a deep breath, and affirming "everything is okay right now."
    *   **Doubt:** The antidote is **investigation** (*Right View* as direct looking, not a philosophical viewpoint). Look closely at the doubt and the situation. Seeing clearly dispels doubt and its twin, fear.
    *   **Sensual Desire (e.g., "Vipassana Romance"):** The antidote is **changing the subject** of the mind. Withdraw attention and energy from the fantasy and redirect it to the wholesome practice.
    *   **Aversion/Irritation:** See it as a hindrance. Recognize that your irritation is your own mind's creation, not the fault of the external trigger (e.g., someone coughing).

4.  **The "Snake Simile" (MN 22):** The Dhamma must be grasped correctly. If you grasp it wrongly (e.g., with rigid rules, or by trying to "tough out" hindrances instead of skillfully replacing them), it will "bite" you and cause more suffering. Correct practice yields **immediate benefit** (feeling better now).

5.  **Practical Method:**
    *   **Guard/Investigate:** Be continuously on guard, investigating the mind's state.
    *   **See & Label:** Clearly see the hindrance and mentally label it ("Aha, restlessness").
    *   **Apply the Antidote:** Apply the specific opposite quality (e.g., apply calm to restlessness, apply investigation to doubt).
    *   **Gladden the Mind:** Replace the unwholesome state with wholesome, joyful thoughts. This proves you can change your mind state and builds confidence.

6.  **The Role of Sangha:** The talk emphasizes that the Buddha and Dhamma are supported by the **Sangha** (spiritual friends). Practicing in community, discussing, and encouraging each other is vital for making the Dhamma work in daily life.

**Conclusion:** The hindrances are not obstacles to a distant goal, but the **very material of daily practice**. By learning to spot them and skillfully replace them with their opposites, we can immediately cultivate a mind that is safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. This repeated success builds the noble, confident attitude that defines the path to liberation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to explain the Five Hindrances and how to work with them:

**1.  The Mouse in the House**
This is the central, extended metaphor.
*   **The Mouse:** Represents a hindrance (e.g., boredom, worry, desire).
*   **The House:** Represents your mind.
*   **Suspecting but not seeing the mouse:** Represents being vaguely aware of dissatisfaction but not clearly identifying the specific hindrance causing it.
*   **Seeing the mouse clearly:** Represents the moment of clear recognition or mindfulness (*"Aha, I see you, boredom!"*). This is not "welcoming" the hindrance but being glad you can now identify it, as that is the first step to dealing with it.
*   **The Noisy Dogs vs. The Effective Cat:** This story within the metaphor contrasts ineffective and effective ways of dealing with hindrances.
    *   **The Dogs (Poonpui and Lucky):** Make a huge, noisy fuss trying to catch the mouse but never succeed. This represents getting overly agitated, frustrated, or identified with the hindrance, which scares it away (i.e., prevents clear seeing and resolution).
    *   **The Cats:** Catch the mouse quietly and efficiently. This represents the ideal meditative attitude: seeing the hindrance clearly and dealing with it skillfully and calmly without a big internal drama.

**2.  The Snake Simile (from MN 22)**
This story, attributed to the Buddha, is used as a warning about misapplying the Dharma (the teachings).
*   **The Snake:** Represents the Dharma itself.
*   **Catching the Snake by the wrong end/place:** Represents practicing incorrectly or with the wrong attitude (e.g., with rigid rules, without understanding, or by adding more suffering).
*   **The Snake Biting You:** Represents the Dharma backfiring—practice leading to more frustration, doubt, or suffering instead of liberation.
*   **Catching the Snake correctly by the throat:** Represents practicing correctly, which in this talk's context means skillfully dealing with hindrances through clear seeing and appropriate antidotes.

**3.  The Vipassana Romance**
This is a cautionary tale/story illustrating multiple hindrances in action.
*   **The Scenario:** A man on a silent retreat becomes infatuated with a woman he sees.
*   **The Hindrances Demonstrated:**
    *   **Sensual Desire (Wanting):** He wants a relationship with her.
    *   **Ill-Will (Aversion):** Implied frustration with the rules of the retreat that separate them.
    *   **Restlessness/Worry:** He spends his time planning how to meet her, scheming, and worrying about it.
    *   **Doubt:** Possibly doubting the practice itself in favor of this romantic fantasy.
*   **The Punchline:** His planning is futile because she leaves early. The story shows how hindrances obstruct correct practice, wasting the opportunity of the retreat.

**4.  The Person Coughing on Retreat**
A brief illustrative scenario.
*   **The Scenario:** Someone on retreat is ill and coughing.
*   **The Reaction of Others:** Others become irritated, wanting the person to be quiet. This reaction *is* the hindrance of **ill-will (aversion)**.
*   **The Point:** The external event (the cough) isn't the problem; the mind's reaction of aversion is the hindrance. A correct practice would be to see that aversion arise: *"Aha, I see irritation."*

**5.  Playing Games on the Phone (Modern Example)**
A metaphor for the cycle of restlessness/boredom.
*   **The Cycle:** You feel bored (restlessness) -> You play a game on your phone to escape it -> You get bored *with the game* if it's too easy or too hard -> The underlying restlessness remains.
*   **The Point:** This is the *wrong* way to deal with the hindrance of restlessness. It's seeking distraction rather than addressing the root mental state. The correct antidote is to cultivate its opposite: peace and contentment with the present moment.

**Summary of Core Analogies:**
*   **Hindrances are like pests** (mice) in the mind-house that need to be spotted and dealt with.
*   **Dealing with them requires the skill of a cat,** not the bluster of a dog.
*   **Misusing the teachings is as dangerous as** mishandling a venomous snake.
*   **Hindrances play out in relatable stories** like retreat romances or irritation with noises.
*   **Our modern coping mechanisms** (like phone games) are often just ways of feeding hindrances, not solving them.

These metaphors and stories make the abstract concept of "hindrances" tangible, memorable, and practically applicable.
