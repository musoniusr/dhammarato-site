### Transcript


**Speaker A:** You'll see, here it says, "Start recording." And it says something blue.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see it.

**Speaker A:** What is it?

**Speaker B:** I see, "Stop recording," black with a blue circle inside.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and there's no clock on your— I don't see a clock, no. All right, okay. Well anyway, I like— Welcome.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to meet you. This is your first call. You're in Germany, transported from one or the other of the Macedonias. True. And you have been practicing what you've been reading in books.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And the practice is turning in, or has turned into striving, or wanting, or having a list of attainments to attain. That's very typical of Western Buddhism. But there are Zen masters that will tell you that you've already gotten it, you're already enlightened. Why are you trying to gain something that you don't have?

**Speaker B:** When you've already got it, right? Right. This Zen kind of mindset of nothing to do, nowhere to be, stuff like that, basically.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, that's the teaching of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Not the teaching of Western Dharma books.

**Speaker B:** Right. I do have one question though. Because I've realized this over-efforting in my practice early on, and I've been trying to find the right balance, like when to give a little bit of effort and when to not give any effort at all.

**Speaker A:** And I think I've also been under-efforting sometimes, like— [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Well, that would be the way that the student would do it. That's just like Little Red Riding Hood. She goes to the porridge that's too hot, then she goes to the porridge that's too cold, and then she goes to the porridge that's just right. And we all do that. We either practice too hard or we practice not enough. That, in fact, you could go so far as to say that the Mahasi method that's practiced in the West is working too hard. Some even call it hardcore Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it is called like that.

**Speaker A:** And then there is the other part which could be called Vajrayana, which is not working enough, just accept all the crap that you're doing. And so they're not putting enough effort down.

**Speaker B:** So how to find this, this balance? I mean, I've heard your advice of like taking a deep breath, relax, everything is okay, everything is fine. This is when there is over-efforting, but like what to do when there is under-efforting, when my awareness gets kind of fuzzy or something?

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not that your awareness gets fuzzy, it's just that you're bringing fuzzy thoughts into the mind. And it's not guarding the mind to keep the fuzzy thoughts out. I see. Um, all has to do then with one's right effort is the right effort of having— in the beginning, one's right effort is just to have some thoughts right from the very beginning. The right effort is to throw the unwholesome thoughts out of the mind and bring wholesome thoughts into the mind. Right. And the thoughts that are worth having in the beginner's mind— see, here's the thing, that what is an unwholesome thought is easily defined when they are totally easily to be seen as unwholesome. But what is absolutely all the time wholesome is a little bit more difficult to see. And then there's a huge, huge gray area in between of sometimes they're wholesome and sometimes they're not. And we have to then have even more discernment. And so the way that we can see that what is surely an unwholesome thought are thoughts of greed, wanting something, that in fact, this is also one of the things that called a hindrance. So if you want something like some attainment, if you want something like some feeling, if you want something like some concept like Jhana or enlightenment or Nibbana, anything that you want should be a sure sign that you're in a state of wanting. Yeah. Okay. And that possibly the better way to start this is to understand it completely from the top down. In the sense, the Buddha said that he only teaches one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is the only thing that the Buddha said that he taught. And when we get off that topic, then we're out of the Noble Dharma into the ordinary world. The Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is in fact the Noble Dhamma in the sense of being able to see what is unwholesome, what is unsatisfying, what is Dukkha, and then take the effort to throw that out or avoid it or to step aside into a state of satisfaction. If we can define then Dukkha as being unsatisfactory, then satisfactory is Dukkha-Nirodha. And so what we need then to practice is the practice of becoming wholesome by getting our mind into a wholesome state, means that now we're satisfied. And we have to understand that satisfaction is satisfaction, is like A girl who is pregnant is either pregnant or she's not pregnant. She could have been pregnant and miscarried, okay, but for a while she's pregnant. And she's pregnant in the beginning, she's pregnant in the middle, and she's pregnant in the end until delivery time. And now she's not pregnant, okay? The same thing can be said for satisfaction. That you're either satisfied a little bit, and a little dab will do you, and then you're satisfied, or you can be satisfied as the satisfaction grows. But if you've got satisfaction and it's not satisfying enough, that is not being satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I'm not being satisfied with the under-effort thing as well.

**Speaker A:** So the whole point again of taking the right effort is that you can see that the right effort that you have immediately a half a second ago is actually working, then you've taken the right effort because you were satisfied with the results of the right effort that you took. Okay, so let's look at this in the sense of a balance point, and that imagine that there was a— let us say the road that you live on, or the highway, and you're standing out in the road for some reason or another and a big truck, big lorry, comes barreling down on you, honking its horn. Now, there's several things that you can do about that. One of them is to be the Popeye, the hardcore meditator, taking the can of spinach called noting, and stand up to that truck with your fist out and try to stop it, and you get run over. The other one is the Vajrayana, of that you see the truck coming and then you just stand there and let it run over you. Choiceless awareness. But there is the third option, which is the noble right effort, of just stand aside. And let it pass.

**Speaker B:** Don't resist it, don't fight it, just let it pass.

**Speaker A:** Don't fight it and don't ignore it, but you have to do something to get out of its way, which means to change the object that's in the mind right now and let that truck pass into the past. Let that unwholesome thought Go and put in a new wholesome thought. And the new wholesome thought would be— well, how do we know what's a wholesome thought? Well, anything that has to do with what actually is right here, right now, is much more likely to be wholesome than if you're thinking about something in the past or something someplace else. If you're thinking about something someplace else, and that's probably because you want something someplace else, and you've got to now go, go to that someplace else so that you can get what you want, right? And so a wholesome thought is more likely to be wholesome if it's right here, right now. So when we're thinking about what's happening right here, right now, then you're much more likely to be out of the hindrances. And that when we're thinking about what's here, right here, right now, we're generally not worried Normally we're worried about something that happened or something that's about to happen, or worried about something that's happening someplace else. But when you're just sitting here, there's no worries. There's no— there, everything is safe and secure right here. And so if we're thinking about right here, we can actually see the absence of danger. And this is one of the wholesome things that we can say. Right to now, there's no danger. Right now there's nothing. There's no snakes on the floor, there's no alligators, there's no crocodiles, there's no boogeymen in the closet, there's no adult yelling at us telling us what to do. That we're just sitting here. Isn't that marvelous? That we're completely free from anything that would be dangerous. That in fact, the only thing now that we have to do to stay alive is to breathe. And if you don't breathe, you're going to be dead in about 3 to 5 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Maybe even sooner.

**Speaker A:** Even sooner if you don't have any skill at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Well, I actually just wanted to mention that this advice that you're giving me now and that you've given to others, I've really taken to heart. With just taking a deep breath, everything is fine. I don't need this. If there is some unwholesome thought, specifically yesterday I had this interview And I had these very intense emotions where I would get excited and start overthinking, and I could immediately see it like, nope, I don't need this. I'm just going to take a deep breath, relax, everything is fine. When it comes, it comes. I don't care. And then it would come over and over and over again, and I would do this over and over and over and over again. Just take a deep breath. Everything is fine now. When the interview comes, it will come.

**Speaker A:** So, Anicca, you have heard the phrase that a hero dies but once, and a coward dies a thousand times. Yeah. Okay, so in the sense of the hero, it's okay to fail. It's okay to fail that interview. That would be the hero's death. But here you are thinking about the interview before it happens. Exactly. Yeah. And so the coward is going to fail that interview many, many times before the interview actually happens. Yeah. But if you don't have any thought about it And in fact, every time that you do think about the interview, you can dismiss it with, oh, I've got that word, I don't have to prepare, everything's going to be okay, anything that needed to be done has already been done, and I can handle that interview fine. And then we can just drop it. Yeah, no worries. Okay, so the thought then of the interview would then be something that we could nourish and then dispose of. It is okay to have the thought that I've got the interview coming, but the next thought should be, yeah, and it's okay, I can handle it, everything is fine. Never mind what's happening right now, start again.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** No, we have the thought about the interview and then we have a feeling, fear. Exactly. And we have another thought of the interview and more fear. And we're not actually then waking up to this thought, fear, thought, fear, thought, fear, Samsara cycle that we get into working ourselves up.

**Speaker B:** True. That's what I noticed also. First, there is the thought, and immediately after the thought, there is the feeling. And after this feeling, there again the thought comes back, and this continues. And I've been able to notice this with strong emotions and strong kind of thoughts like yesterday, for example, but not so much with more subtle thoughts like having a conversation in your head with a colleague about some topic, for example, and throwing that out. Like, it's not important who's right or who's wrong. I don't care. I don't need to think about this person, this colleague. I just have to be now and enjoy.

**Speaker A:** But this is what we would then practice while we're not in the face of the colleague. This is the whole point about getting away from all of that stuff, getting away from it all, so that we can find some peace and quiet in the reality of the environment that we're in, so that now we can practice the peace and quiet on this end, on the inside. And so seclusion is one of the primary ingredients of a correct practice, is getting away from it all. The Buddha gives an analogy of a log and a bog, that logs get saturated and then they fall to the bottom. If a firemaker from ancient times, if he came to that log, let us say that it was just floating on the surface of the water, just barely exposed like an iceberg, could he set that log on fire with primitive firemaking equipment that our primitive, let us say professional firemaker in the time of the Buddha had back actually people who had equipment to make fires. That was their job. Now we have machines to do that for us, so we don't have to work so hard. So imagine that you had to work really hard to get a fire started, but you were expert at it. Could you set that log on fire, the one in the bog?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it will— it would be very, very hard, I guess.

**Speaker A:** And it would not be possible. In fact, it would not be. You're thinking about using a blowtorch, right? A modern piece of equipment. But in the old days, no. But what if you took the log out of the bog and put it up on the shore? Could it now be set on fire?

**Speaker B:** If it's, if it's dry, I guess.

**Speaker A:** No, it's still wet because you just took it out of the bog.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And so now that means that it can't. But if you leave the log up on dry land in a place that's secluded from the bog, then both sunshine and gravity will do the work for the log so that the gravity will pull the water out the bottom of the log and the top of the log will then become dry enough for it to be set on fire. This is exactly how dugout canoes are made. It's like setting the top of the log on fire and then digging it out and setting more fire and more fire until you get a dugout canoe. Then you can take that dugout canoe and put it back in the bog after it's dried out and hollowed out And now it's a boat, not a log saturated with water, which means that occasionally you have to take the boat out of the water to keep it too from becoming waterlogged.

**Speaker B:** Right, but these thoughts happen when I'm home, when I'm secluded, when I'm making lunch or something.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the time to practice.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. I know this is the time to practice, but And I'm— but these thoughts are more subtle, and I'm saying, okay, be mindful.

**Speaker A:** No, they're not subtle. You're just not watching.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Not paying attention to what the mind is doing. This is a skill to be developed. This is— this is Sati, the skill of remembering to look.

**Speaker B:** I have questions about Sati in particular. In regards to Anapanasati as taught by Buddhadasa, but also with TMI as well. Like in TMI, Sati or mindfulness as the Western term is described as the optimal interaction.

**Speaker A:** That's one of the things that we'll have to talk about. On a regular basis so that you make sure that you understand.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** 90% of the problem with Western Buddhism is bad translations, and Sati is wrongly translated into mindfulness. In fact, you probably never heard of mindfulness except in Buddhist context. It's almost an invented word.

**Speaker B:** That's true. Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** And so If we use the word Sati, we can use it in the sense more of wakey-wakey, or to wake up, or to remember to be here now rather than lost in the fog of the dream state. I understand. Is either dreaming at night when you're asleep, or it's dreaming in the day, which we call daydreams, which means that we're not paying attention to what's happening. In the present moment. So we need to wake up.

**Speaker B:** My question was, is there like another component of Sati? I know one component is waking up to what you're supposed to do. So let's say watching the breath.

**Speaker A:** It has 3 components.

**Speaker B:** That's what I wanted to ask. I know the first component, but I feel like something is missing. I remember what I'm supposed to do, but I feel like It's not— it's kind of weak. It's allowing stuff to pass by without noticing.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to tell me what you believe.

**Speaker B:** No, okay.

**Speaker A:** Listen to what I'm saying.

**Speaker B:** Please.

**Speaker A:** And that is, there are three kinds of Sati. One is just in general to remember And this is a skill that we have to practice to develop, is just to remember to wake up. So that would be the frequency— how often can you remember to wake up? The second one has to do with the intensity of the waking up. All right, that intensity can be seen in this regard of when you first wake up in the morning What's the very first thing you do?

**Speaker B:** I note getting up, turning.

**Speaker A:** You note that you're conscious, that you become consciously aware that you're conscious. That's the waking up. But there's a whole different waking up, and that is the getting out of the bed. So people can wake up to the thoughts that they're in, and then they just wallow in those thoughts. Knowing that they're thinking about robbing the bank or beating up the teacher or throwing the book at the author or, um, going on to Reddit and trashing this, that, and the other thing. So, uh, there's a— there's an intensity to waking, and that is to actually wake up enough to have the right effort. Or another way of saying it is, is that effort— when we have very little Sati, or when it's not strong, then it takes a lot of effort. And this is for the beginners, because the beginner's Sati is weak, therefore the effort that it takes is strong. But once the Sati becomes really strong, the wakey wakey is a really loud wake-up. I mean, it's actually possible for in one second, from fast asleep to standing at attention.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So the Anicca, can you wake up and get up immediately? Okay. When Dukkha comes along and wakes you up, can you wake up enough that you can get right up for it? That would be then a combination of the effort right effort and right wakefulness, that you take the effort and get up immediately rather than the struggle. And you've seen how it is when you feel tired and you wake up in the morning and you say, well, I don't really want to get up right now. And so we don't take the effort. Okay, so that's another kind of Sati, is how intense it is. The more intense it is, the easier it is to take the right effort. Now, the definition of right effort would be the very least amount of possible action, effort, to get the job actually done. And yet most of the people, when they're not getting the job done, they think, oh, I need more effort, and I need more effort, and I need more effort. And now it's a struggle, now it's hardcore. Dharma, because they're working way too hard to get something that they want instead of not working at all because they've already recognized that they've got what they wanted.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** That's the job that needs to be done, is to see that the job is finished, that it's done. What was the job that needed to be done? Stop thinking that there was a job to do.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** And to recognise the job is finished now. Once the job is finished, you can relax.

**Speaker B:** I see. So the second component of Sati depends on the first one, where you constantly get into this kind of habit of remembering there's nothing to do, nowhere to be, and in time— Anagami, the strength, and the strength in truth.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it also improves with success, which I'll talk about in just a moment. All right, so basically what this is, is that there's 4 things. One is right view, Sati, to wake up and to look, and then to take the effort to make a change. Now, a lot of people have the idea that they can't change, that they are who they are. Christianity promotes this big time— original sin and all of that kind of stuff, right? And so, um, that's why they want to get forgiveness. And forgiveness is also, uh, not just forgiveness for what you just did, but it's also implicit in getting forgiven again and again and again and again and keep screwing up and getting forgiveness and keep screwing up and and getting forgiveness. That's what modern Christianity teaches, which is not at all what we need to practice, nor is that what Jesus or the Buddha were teaching. Both of them talked about wakefulness, to wake up, to witness, to look at what's going on, and then to make a change. And the change then would be to coming out of the unwholesome into the wholesome. That would be one's right effort. If we then look at it this way, that those three things run in circle around each other, building up a skill: right effort, along with right Sati, and right investigation, to keep looking, keep noting, keep watching. And that's where the Mahasi system in the West—not Mahasi himself, because Mahasi's literature talks about grabbing the object, seizing the object, control of the object. And the way that Westerners practice is, oh ho hum, I'm just going to note it. I'm going to note that dragon while it's swallowing me whole. I'm going to notice that lorry as it runs right over me.

**Speaker B:** The analogy of the dragon swallowing me whole, is that getting caught up in the content of the thoughts and feelings? Okay, right.

**Speaker A:** The note that you are, uh, thinking, and that in fact this is how then the Mahayana method sees that Dukkha, Dukkha, and Nirodha, is Dukkha. Oh really? Well, let's look at that Dukkha and see what it is. Oh, I see that. I see it again. Then I see this Dukkha related to that Dukkha. Let's dig a little deeper, a little digger into the bottom of this. Let's go right down to the bottom of the sewer. In order to clean out the sewer. That's the Mahayana method, is— and do they wind up being covered with their own sewage? This is the dark night of the soul. Yeah, but you're drowning in your own sewage. Or another one is that you're in your own city dump looking for all the Dukkha. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha, Nirodha immediately. See the Dukkha and get out of it. See that thought and change it immediately. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** It's not something that will happen in the future.

**Speaker A:** It's not something that you're going to be rid of. It's not going to— I have the idea that it's going to rot away eventually if I keep looking. It's like watching paint dry or watching a pot boil. Are watching the grass grow. All right, and this is the idea that if I keep watching, like, in fact, is my watching that makes the paint dry? Is my watching that makes the pot boil? Is my watching that makes the grass grow? Oh no, oh no. And so watching in order to hope that the Dukkha is going to be diminished— no, when you're watching Dukkha, it's just going to get more and more and more. You're multiplying it almost intentionally. Ignorantly but intentionally making it more and more. That's why there's those phrases in the, uh, 16 Stages of Insight that are called fear, misery, disgust, despair, and a strong desire to get out of it. If you're familiar with that document, you can see I'm listing them one after another. Yeah, well, that's what people do before they ever start meditation. So they're just doing more of it and deeper while they're meditating. The right thing to do is when you can see enough fear, enough misery, enough dissatisfaction, enough disgust, enough despair, to get out of it before it gets too deep. Doesn't have to get piled higher and deeper.

**Speaker B:** You don't need a PhD, right?

**Speaker A:** Just remembering to get out of it immediately when you see it. Immediately, as soon as we can catch it. Okay. Which brings upon the third quality then, which is of Sati, which is directly related to the first quality, and that is the frequency. But now we're talking about it in the sense of speed. How quick could you wake up? Okay, so if you do wake up frequency but it's only a little bit, it's weak, then it's also going to be very slow. But if you wake up strongly, the frequency is strong, then you can have very quick response, right? So the components build up on each other, I guess, right? Exactly. And so this is why we call Sati a skill to be developed, as well as the point of taking the right effort is a skill to be developed. In the beginning, the effort is strong because the Sati is weak and the investigation skills are weak. But as those other two things get rolling, the effort becomes easier and easier. The effort then is taken in the sense of two things. One is to gladden the mind. Whatever level of wholesome you're at now, you can be a little more wholesome than that. So gladdening the mind would be like a ladder of coming out of your own sewer, one step at a time. At least I'm better off now than I was before. At least I've got my head above the sewage. Now I can breathe. At least I've got my torso above, and I can feel the sunshine on my chest. Okay, so that's the way that we look at it. Keep gladdening the mind, bringing it up out of our own mental sewer one step at a time. That's the stages that we're going in. And so that would be one's right effort. To change the unwholesome into the wholesome, gladdening the mind. So that's one side of the right effort. The other side of the right effort is to start changing directly the way that you breathe, so that you take the long deep in-breaths that the Anapanasati Sutta calls for. But, and this is something also that Mahasi taught in the sense of seizing the object, falling upon the object, confronting the object, that's also to be done with the breath, because it's one of the objects that we're looking for, one of the stages or steps of Anapanasati, and it's actually better to call them 16 objects of meditation. One of them is long, deep in-breath, and the other one is long, deep out-breath, and we need Sati, to remember to take a long deep breath rather than being an ordinary breath, so that seizing of the object is done with Sati and with the right effort to take a more wholesome in-breath and to take a more wholesome out-breath. So we learn to control the breathing.

**Speaker B:** I do have one question regarding this, since I managed to find Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Anapanasati book. So I've read through the first tetrad, I think.

**Speaker A:** And don't make any conclusions.

**Speaker B:** I'm not making conclusions.

**Speaker A:** Read the whole book. And in fact, it's very much later. You see, the problem with those books, and actually with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, he teaches exactly the way that it's taught in the sutta. But the sutta was doing it in an organized way to make sure that the stages were understood this way by an audience who already knew the correct practice. That's not the way to teach a beginner, because the beginner gets the idea that you do the first tetrad first because it's first in the book, then you do the second tetrad second because you read that second in the book, etc., like that. In fact, in one of the books on Anapanasati, it's on page 213 of the book, where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says, this is the first thing that you need to do. Practice this from the very beginning. And you've been practicing all of this months by reading the book a little slowly and doing a little bit, and then it was one step at a time. Like an instruction manual. No, it's not an instruction manual like that, even though it says that it's for serious beginners. And the serious beginner, that's actually not a good translation out of what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually meant. A better word would be Anapanasati, a practice for enthusiastic beginners. I see. Eager beginners, those who are really going to go into it without that serious quality of working too hard. Then when you're serious about something, it's a whole lot more work than when you're doing it enthusiastically. So this is a word that has a lot to do with one's right effort. Is do it enthusiastically, doing it eagerly, rather than doing it seriously. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** To be fair, my practice hasn't felt like a chore in a long time. Like, I enjoy sitting.

**Speaker A:** I'm looking forward to each sitting as well.

**Speaker B:** I have a very specific question regarding the first two kind of steps. I know they are not steps as in you need to complete the first step to get to the second step and the third step, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says making the breath long and making the breath short, is this done intentionally or are you waiting for the breath itself to become like that? Like, are you intentionally changing the breath and the longitude of the breath?

**Speaker A:** The language that you're using indicates the answer is already there in front of you. Change— I don't see it— got to be done. It's got to be making it. It's that— how is the breath going to change to a long breath just because you're thinking about long breath, hoping that the breath is going to become long?

**Speaker B:** No, you've got to do something.

**Speaker A:** You have to mindfully breathe in long. You have to seize that object. Now here's something quite interesting, and that is, he said, in order to take a long deep breath, you're training not the body, you're training the mind, because it's the mind that's controlling the breath, and it's also the mind that's controlling it when there is not much to it. Or let us say subconscious or ignorant breathing. So if we're going to be mindful of breathing, we're not going to breathe the same way that we were breathing when we were breathing ignorantly. If mindful breathing and ignorant breathing are the same thing, then what's the bother? What's the point? Another interesting issue is that when you are just watching the breath or just noting it, then the mind will run away to go note something else. The monkey mind will just jump and jump and jump and jump. But if you are mindfully applying, when you're taking the effort to stay with that Sati, to continue to investigate, is this a long deep breath or not, putting those three things together into one operation, right? Effort, right view, or right looking, and right Sati, to remember to look, over and over again, is an action, it's an activity, it's changing the way that we used to do it. And when you're practicing that way, now the mind is in gear to watch the body, breathing, right here, right now. So now our thoughts are wholesome because we're looking at something that's happening right here, right now, in front of us— this breathing. Where the ordinary meditator who's watching the breath, his mind is going to go off into the future or into the past, and he is not able to see that happening. That jump is done mindlessly. Why? Because he's watching his breath mindlessly. If he is mindfully watching his breath, which means controlling the breath, then if the mind wanders away, it's easier to catch it. I see. And it's not so likely to wander away. Now, the other point is, is that when we are watching the body breathe we're in the here-now. We're not in the past, we're not into the unwholesome futures and other places and other things and other problems that we worry about. There's no worry because all we're doing is watching the body breathe right here, right now. And by now using these two features of mindfully breathing long, in-breaths and mindfully breathing long out-breaths while we're talking and thinking about what the body is doing, we're also intentionally going to be gladdening the mind or perking it up in the sense of finding what's useful, valuable, and wholesome about the breathing that we're doing now so that we can begin to experience the body. So that's the third step of Anapanasati, is watching what the body is doing. And what we're actually going to be watching and looking for is tensions, sensations, what's happening with the body, what's happening with the hands. And so when we're just sitting there still, we can feel the sensations of the hands. But when we're out in the world, we can still pay more attention to what the hands are doing than the object that we're holding. Almost always when we're carrying something, we're thinking about the object that we're carrying. So if you've got a suitcase by the handle, you're thinking about the suitcase and how heavy the suitcase is, rather than paying attention to the hand carrying the suitcase.

**Speaker B:** Okay, to the sensation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right, the sensations of the fingers, the sensations of the hands. So this now is the Anapanasati, is paying attention to what the body is doing. And so the more often we're practicing what the body is doing and paying attention to it, the more in the present moment that we are. When we're thinking about the suitcase as being heavy, then we often think about where we're taking the suitcase and how heavy it is and all kinds of contents in the suitcase and all of that. But when we're thinking about the hand and holding the the suitcase. Now we can feel the touch and the sensations. If the hand is getting tired, maybe we can set the suitcase down for a second. We don't have to be in a hurry to go anyplace. We can be relaxed. And so this also is what we could do, is we can, uh, if we're mindful of the thoughts that are carrying, or the mind that's carrying these thoughts then we can set those thoughts down. And so this is what we're looking for, is to gladden the mind, to set these objects down, to pay attention to the gladdening of the mind, and to recognize that we do gladden the mind, that we can gladden our spirit. And by having gladdening, wholesome thoughts, we begin to feel the way that we're talking. That in fact, a good thing, a good way of looking at it is, is that we people have been talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lifetime. Now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good. That's the gladdening of the mind, Step 10 of Anapanasati. As we're looking at the body, and as we're looking for the body, we're also looking at the gladdening in the sense of softening We're relaxing the tensions in the body so that the body will relax. We're also softening the tensions on the mind so that the mind will relax. And then the mind and the body operate in a pincer movement of both sides to start working on the feelings. So that's the fourth one. We're gladdening the mind and relaxing the body so that we begin to feel good. We begin to feel safe, begin to feel secure, especially if we're talking ourselves into right here, right now, everything is safe, everything is secure. I'm looking at the body and saying, and it is comfortable. So safe and secure and comfortable. Brings on that feeling of satisfaction, the feeling of liking. So we're beginning to control the way that we feel. I see. By talking ourselves into it and by relaxing the body. So we work together on these two things.

**Speaker B:** It's a positive feedback loop, so to say.

**Speaker A:** It is a positive feedback loop. And so as we're doing this, by having positive, wholesome thoughts and gladdening the mind, the mind in that point of time is free from the hindrances. While we are applying the mind to the wholesome and then sustaining those wholesome thoughts, we're adding another couple of factors in to keep applying to the wholesome, to keep applying to the safety and security, and keep sustaining that. And as we continue to do that, applying and sustaining the wholesome we begin to feel safe and secure and satisfied, which now means at this point in time we're actually free from Dukkha. And we know that because we can see it, because we're paying attention to it, and we tell ourselves about it. This is nice. I can do this. I am in fact feeling pretty good right now. Ah, that feels so good. And here's where we add another ingredient that's on the Eightfold Noble Path, and that is the Samma Sanghappa, or our attitude. Because we spend our lives starting in childhood, the child is a victim. The child has to be nurtured and taken care of or it will die. The child has to do what his parents are telling him to do or he's going to get a spanking. And so we're victimized by our society. The reason why mothers hold a little child's hand and the child's got his hand up in the air like that. When you're an adult, you don't need someone holding your hand to help you to steady. You could do that on your own, and as you're practicing Anapanasati and it gets steady, we come out of our victim's attitude into the attitude of the winner, the lion. I can do this. I can do this. I can feel good. I can be satisfied. Not satisfied 99% with a little bit of dissatisfaction. No, I can actually just let that one satisfaction, dissatisfaction go and come back into a state of satisfaction. As we practice that over and over, a kind of a wow sensation comes on. The sense of not just satisfaction, but the sense of success. Success. "I can do this." That is Samma Sanghappa, that's the right intention. So we're changing our intention from the intention of getting what we want, into the right, noble intention of, "I can do this. I can do it again. No matter what happens, I can do it." that in fact there is a state in the student's mind that's in Sutta 48 in the Kasambhyan Sutta, is where the Buddha talks about that when the student comes to the point that he has the position or the intention or the winner's attitude, that no matter what comes up in the mind, no matter what obstructions, no matter what hindrances are, I can throw those out and come back and see things the way that they really are, no matter what it is— sick in the hospital, getting busted by the cops, riding in the back of the cop car, in the, uh, in the courtroom, at the interview, in jail. Whatever obstructions that come into the mind I can handle that too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this kind of attitude doesn't come that hard to me personally, as I've been doing martial arts for like 10 or 12 years, and even in that kind of environment, they are cultivating this: who cares, I can take this, I can do this, like I can take care of it. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** So absolutely, That's it. Yeah, that, that, uh, let us say that that's the Zen influence on the martial arts from Japan and China, the Chan and the Zen and the Shaolin. You've heard all of these words. That's where this attitude is added to the skill of the martial arts. When it's being taught. Because as you probably understand, there's right now a whole lot of Russian soldiers who are in the Ukraine that don't have a good attitude about what they're doing, and they're not going to be very good at it. Yeah. And it doesn't matter how well trained as a soldier they were, they weren't trained in the right attitude, that winner's attitude. We can do this. Okay, that's what's instilled in the martial arts, is I can do this, I can handle that. Okay, sometimes you got to get your butt beat to recognize that, hey, I can get my butt beat and I can still stand up, get it beat up again. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** You have this feeling like, so I get beat up, so who cares?

**Speaker A:** I can continue, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** It's this self-perpetuating kind of mindset, like all the time. You can do this.

**Speaker A:** You can figure it out. Yes. Once it gets on a roll.

**Speaker B:** Once it gets on the roll. At first, you are the victim.

**Speaker A:** So to say, you're making yourself the victim. Right. Exactly. And so that's where the right effort is strong effort. Yeah. It needs a lot of effort, but it's still right and correct because it's getting the job done. Later, when we attitude change, now the effort is easier because we've got that intention, we've got that attitude, we've got the skill, and also the skill of the Sati of being quick and strong as well as frequent. And so these are the four points that we're putting in together. This right attitude then brings on the step 5 of Anapanasati, or let us say object number 5, and that is that wow feeling. Wow, I can't do this. Imagine at the Olympics in the 100-yard dash, the winner is 3 to 5 steps before the finish line and he is well ahead of the pack. As he's going across that finish line, what's the first part of his body that's going to touch that ribbon or that finish line?

**Speaker B:** I would say the foot, but I think it's a trick question.

**Speaker A:** Right, in fact, he's going to cross that thing with his chest. He's going to be already with the winner's mentality. No. Okay. Many of the races are so close that you got to keep going even right to the very end because you got that competition. But once you're ahead of the pack, then in fact that last step or two may be a slowing down kind of step rather than a continuing to speed up step. Yeah, because you've already gotten the win. You know that you want— that's what we're talking about, is that knowledge of the victory. And you already begin to experience that. So when a football player makes a touchdown, what does he do? He has a victory dance. Yeah, okay, that victory dance is the dance of success, the dance of the victory. That's what we're going to be doing while sitting there quietly on the floor having a victory celebration. Yeah, the word for that in Pali is Piti.

**Speaker B:** Piti, yeah, I see.

**Speaker A:** It's translated wrongly as, um, rapture, I think. Was it? Okay, yeah, but you can see that, yeah, you might be able to use the word rapture for that, but the Christians have stolen that word and have their own use for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, since English is not my native language, I— it doesn't ring a bell to me. Like, rapture is the first time I've seen This word, first time I've seen it is in Buddhism. So yeah, it doesn't have a meaning that's related to Christianity specifically for me.

**Speaker A:** Think of it then as wrapped in the victory. Wrapped up in the victory for that moment. It feels so good that it's almost overwhelming.

**Speaker B:** This is when you get to the first Jhana, basically.

**Speaker A:** That's the first Jhana. Okay. When you have all of these factors together that I've been mentioning in order of freedom from the obstructions and hindrances, because we've applied the mind and sustained the mind on the wholesome, giving the body to relax, allowing the feeling of safety, security, comfort, and success to arise, and we do that over and over and over again, and then success and the knowledge of success and the Piti arises. And this is the qualities of the first Jhana. These are the gathering of the factors together. This is why it's called Samadhi, not because we're concentrating. We're not— not once have I talked about concentration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, uh, I've read somewhere that the value put on concentration specifically in TMI, but also in probably another Samadhi kind of books, is that it's overblown. Like, you don't need to have this.

**Speaker A:** Not just overblown, but it is actually an act in some ways just the opposite of what we're trying to do, because concentration means that we're really working to focus on. Right. An example is that the teacher gets really angry at the kid, grabs the kid by the arm, and hauls him off into the principal's office. The kid is struggling, but the teacher is concentrating on holding his hand so he can't escape. Right, that's concentration. Yeah. Another example of concentration is concentrated frozen orange juice. Okay, but nobody drinks frozen concentrated orange juice. They take the water out of it for transportation. You want the orange juice to be not concentrated when you drink it. You want to put water and ice in it, which now makes it more complete. That's when it's Samadhi. So in this way of using concentration, concentration is exactly the opposite. Samadhi. Another way of looking at it is concentration means that you're taking— that you're ignoring a whole lot of stuff and focusing on just one object or just one thing. Right. Well, Anapanasati has a whole lot of objects and we've got to seize them all and put them together.

**Speaker B:** But there is no order in seizing them.

**Speaker A:** Well, I just gave you the order. Yeah. Because it's a natural order, not an order that's listed in the sutta, in the Anapanasati Sutta.

**Speaker B:** So could we link this to dependent origination, where one thing depends upon the other thing to happen? And for example, Piti can't arise if there is a hindrance.

**Speaker A:** For example, right, right. And Piti can't arise if there's no Sukkha, and Sukkha cannot arise when the mind has unwholesome thoughts and there's no gladness. Okay, okay, I see. So yes, there are dependencies here, and if that dependency is ignorant, then whatever we feel— if, for instance, if we, if we have the feeling of liking but it's an ignorant liking because we're not practicing at all then the mind, ignorant mind, will go to, I like it, therefore I want it.

**Speaker B:** I want it. I want to keep it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I want to keep it. And so this happens with meditation students and they get a first Jhana and then they lose it. And now their feeling is, I liked it, I want it, and I don't have it. So instead of going back to liking, they're now in a state of not liking because they don't have what they want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we are not taught, I guess, to just relax into it. We are taught to bring in more effort to the table, try harder. If something doesn't succeed, try harder.

**Speaker A:** All right, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Yeah, I actually said that to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa when I was very new at So I'm looking, he laughed at me, and he says, "No." Because this is probably the first time he'd ever heard that English statement, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." And he says, "No. If at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing." Look at what you're doing. If you look at what you're doing when you're trying, then you'll figure out a way of getting it correct. Taking the right effort. Once you see what you're doing is not correct, now you can make corrections to it, which is your right effort, and then you can enjoy the success of having done it correctly rather than the failure of trying and trying and trying again. But that's not taught in these books. It's not, though TMI does mention to have this kind of not judgmental mentality where you, if you see the mind caught up in something— All the good stuff is in the book, all the good stuff is in the book, but neither the guy who wrote the book nor the people who read the book quite understand the process. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, it's in the book, but the students read right through it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly, exactly. Like, I've been returning to it and I see, well, why I wasn't doing this at all. Like, I was being judgmental, I was being pushy, like I was wanting things and experiences and stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** And the book can't correct you.

**Speaker B:** It can't, exactly. So yeah, like, or a good friend. Or a good friend, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Who knows what's going on. So that's how you want to see me. Yeah. See me as a good friend who knows what's going on. Exactly. As opposed to a teacher. I don't fit the teacher model very well.

**Speaker B:** This was really, really nice talk, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Well, let's finish now and you can go practice this. And then call me back. Awesome.

**Speaker B:** Right after or next day or how?

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say once to twice a week would be a good thing.

**Speaker B:** Once to twice a week. All right. All right.

**Speaker A:** Awesome. Every few days. You need to practice a few days before you report back. Kind of.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I understand. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Awesome.

**Speaker A:** Cool. And then call me when you need me. Yeah, or call me when you don't, because then it'll be even a better conversation. I agree. Okay, Alec, well, it's been nice to meet you, and I hope to see you again soon.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Have a nice day. Take care.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you have a nice moment right now.

**Speaker B:** This will be right now. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Have a nice moment. Awesome. See ya. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a practitioner (Speaker B) focuses on correcting common misunderstandings in Western meditation practice and outlining a more natural, effective approach based on the Buddha's core teachings. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: Over-Efforting and Goal-Oriented Practice**
*   The practitioner identifies a common trap in Western Buddhism: turning practice into a striving for attainments (like Jhana or enlightenment).
*   Dhammarato contrasts this with the Zen-like (and truly Buddhist) view that "you've already got it." The fundamental error is wanting something you believe you don't have.

### **Finding the "Middle Way" of Right Effort**
*   The practitioner asks how to balance over-efforting and under-efforting.
*   **Dhammarato's Analogy:** Imagine a truck (an unwholesome thought or hindrance) coming at you.
    *   **Over-efforting (Mahasi/"Hardcore" style):** Like trying to stop the truck with your fists—you get run over.
    *   **Under-efforting (Vajrayana/"Choiceless Awareness" style):** Like just standing there and letting it run over you.
    *   **Right Effort (The Middle Way):** Simply step aside. Don't fight it or ignore it, but **change the object in the mind.** Let the unwholesome thought pass and replace it with a wholesome one.

### **What is a Wholesome Thought?**
*   A thought focused on **"right here, right now."**
*   When you are present, you can see the absence of danger and worry. You can recognize: "Right now, I am safe. I am breathing. Everything is fine." This is the foundation for gladdening the mind.

### **The Central Framework: Dukkha and Its Cessation**
*   The Buddha taught **Dukkha (unsatisfactoriness) and Nirodha (its cessation).**
*   Practice is not about analyzing Dukkha deeply (which can multiply it, leading to the "Dark Night of the Soul"). It's about **seeing Dukkha and immediately stepping out of it into a state of satisfaction (Nirodha).**
*   Satisfaction is like pregnancy—you either have it or you don't. The job is to recognize and cultivate that state of "already being satisfied."

### **The Role of *Sati* (Mindfulness)**
*   **Sati is mistranslated as "mindfulness."** It's better understood as **"remembering to wake up"** from daydreams (past/future thinking).
*   **Sati has three components:**
    1.  **Frequency:** How often you remember to wake up to the present.
    2.  **Intensity/Strength:** How fully you wake up. Strong *Sati* makes right effort easy and immediate.
    3.  **Speed:** How quickly you can wake up and respond. This improves with practice.
*   With strong *Sati*, you see the thought-feeling cycle (e.g., interview thought -> fear -> more thought) and can interrupt it by waking up and changing the object.

### **Practical Application: *Ānāpānasati* (Mindfulness of Breathing)**
*   It's not a passive "watching" of the natural breath. It's an **active, mindful cultivation.**
*   **You intentionally breathe long and deep** (as the sutta says). This trains the *mind*, not just the body. Actively controlling the breath keeps the mind engaged in the present moment (a wholesome thought-object) and makes it easier to notice when it wanders.
*   The 16 steps are **not a linear checklist.** They are interdependent factors that develop together in a feedback loop:
    1.  Mindfully breathing long/short.
    2.  Feeling the bodily sensations (calming the body).
    3.  Gladdening and steadying the mind with wholesome thoughts (e.g., "I am safe now").
    4.  This leads to pleasant feelings (*sukha*) and a **"winner's attitude"** (*sammā saṅkappa*)—"I can do this. No matter what, I can return to this wholesome state."
*   This positive feedback loop culminates in the joyful, victorious feeling of *pīti* (rapture/bliss), a factor of the first *jhāna*.

### **Crucial Attitude Shift: From Victim to Winner**
*   We are conditioned from childhood into a victim mentality.
*   Through this practice, we cultivate the attitude of a **winner or a lion:** "I can handle this. I can find satisfaction regardless of circumstances." This is the right intention on the Noble Eightfold Path.

### **Critique of "Concentration" (*Samādhi*)**
*   *Samādhi* is **not concentration** (which implies exclusion and force).
*   It is a **unification** or **collection** of wholesome factors (gladdened mind, relaxed body, pleasant feeling, victorious attitude). It's like reconstituting orange juice—bringing all the good elements together, not narrowing down to one.

### **Conclusion & Advice**
*   **Practice:** Actively cultivate wholesome, present-moment thoughts. Breathe deeply and intentionally to gladden the mind and relax the body. Look for the feeling of safety and success *right now*.
*   **When you fail:** Don't "try, try again." Instead, **"look at what you're doing."** Investigate, then apply the *right* effort.
*   **Seclusion:** Practice this in quiet times to build the skill, so you can apply it in daily life.
*   **Guidance:** Books contain the right information but can't correct you. Regular dialogue with a knowledgeable friend is essential.

The talk ends with an invitation for the practitioner to apply this and check back in regularly.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to illustrate the teachings:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Three Bowls of Porridge (from *Goldilocks*)**  
    *   **Used to explain:** Finding the right balance of effort in meditation, avoiding both over-efforting ("too hot"/hardcore) and under-efforting ("too cold"/permissive).
    *   **Quote:** "That's just like Little Red Riding Hood. She goes to the porridge that's too hot, then she goes to the porridge that's too cold, and then she goes to the porridge that's just right."

2.  **The Oncoming Truck**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The three possible responses to an unwholesome thought or "hindrance."
        1.  **Popeye (Hardcore/Noting):** Fighting it directly and getting "run over."
        2.  **Vajrayana (Choiceless Awareness):** Ignoring it and letting it "run over" you.
        3.  **The Noble Right Effort:** Simply stepping aside and letting it pass.
    *   **Quote:** "Just stand aside. And let it pass."

3.  **Pregnancy**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The state of satisfaction (*Dukkha-Nirodha*). You are either satisfied or you are not; it's a binary state that can grow, but "not satisfied enough" is not satisfaction.
    *   **Quote:** "A girl who is pregnant is either pregnant or she's not pregnant... The same thing can be said for satisfaction."

4.  **The Log in the Bog**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The necessity of **seclusion** for practice. A waterlogged log (a mind saturated with worldly thoughts) cannot catch fire (achieve insight). It must be removed from the bog (secluded) and allowed to dry (through gravity and sunshine/time) before it can be ignited.
    *   **Extended to:** The process of making a dugout canoe, which must also be taken out of the water periodically to prevent it from becoming waterlogged again.
    *   **Quote:** "This is exactly how dugout canoes are made... you have to take the boat out of the water to keep it too from becoming waterlogged."

5.  **The Sewer / City Dump**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The error of certain meditation approaches (specifically some "Mahayana" or heavy noting practices) that focus on exploring *dukkha* (suffering) in depth.
    *   **Metaphor:** Digging through a sewer or dump to clean it, which results in being covered in sewage. The correct method is to see *dukkha* and get out immediately.
    *   **Quote:** "Let's go right down to the bottom of the sewer... That's the Mahayana method... you're drowning in your own sewage."

6.  **Watching Paint Dry / Grass Grow**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The mistake of passive observation with the hope that *dukkha* will fade on its own. Observation alone doesn't cause transformation; right effort is required.
    *   **Quote:** "It's like watching paint dry or watching a pot boil... Is my watching that makes the grass grow? Oh no... watching in order to hope that the Dukkha is going to be diminished—no."

7.  **The Ladder Out of the Sewer**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The process of "gladdening the mind" through right effort. It's a step-by-step process of moving from unwholesome to more wholesome states.
    *   **Quote:** "Keep gladdening the mind, bringing it up out of our own mental sewer one step at a time."

8.  **Concentrated Orange Juice**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The difference between **concentration** (*focusing*, which excludes things) and **samadhi** (*unification*, which integrates things). Samadhi is the complete, diluted, enjoyable drink, not the concentrated syrup.
    *   **Quote:** "Concentration means that you're taking— that you're ignoring a whole lot of stuff and focusing on just one object... Samadhi [is] more complete."

9.  **The Teacher Dragging a Child**  
    *   **Used to explain:** "Concentration" as a forced, effortful, and restrictive action, which is the opposite of the unified, relaxed state of *samadhi*.
    *   **Quote:** "The teacher is concentrating on holding his hand so he can't escape. Right, that's concentration."

### **Stories & Cultural References**

1.  **The Hero and the Coward**  
    *   **Used to explain:** Anticipatory anxiety vs. dealing with the actual event. Worrying about a future event (like an interview) is "dying a thousand times" (the coward). Facing the event itself, even if you fail, is "dying but once" (the hero).
    *   **Quote:** "A hero dies but once, and a coward dies a thousand times... you are thinking about the interview before it happens... the coward is going to fail that interview many, many times before the interview actually happens."

2.  **The Olympic Sprinter / Football Touchdown Dance**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The phenomenon of ***piti*** (often translated as "rapture" or "joy"). It's the embodied feeling of victory and success that arises from correct practice, akin to an athlete's moment of triumph.
    *   **Quote:** "When a football player makes a touchdown, what does he do? He has a victory dance... that's what we're going to be doing while sitting there quietly on the floor having a victory celebration."

3.  **Martial Arts Attitude**  
    *   **Used to explain:** ***Samma Sankappa*** (Right Intention or Attitude)—the "winner's attitude" of "I can do this." Speaker B connects this to his martial arts training, and Speaker A affirms it, linking it to the Zen influence on martial arts.
    *   **Quote:** "That's the Zen influence on the martial arts... That's where this attitude is added to the skill... I can handle that."

4.  **Anecdote about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**  
    *   **Used to explain:** The error in the common saying "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." The correct approach is to investigate and adjust, not just repeat the same effort.
    *   **Quote:** "He says, 'No. If at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing.'"

### **Summary of Purpose**
These metaphors and stories are central to Dhammarato's teaching style. They serve to:
*   **Demystify abstract Buddhist concepts** (like *piti*, *samadhi*, *right effort*).
*   **Critique common misinterpretations** of Western Buddhist practice (over-efforting, passive noting, misdefining mindfulness).
*   **Provide memorable, practical instructions** for how to relate to thoughts, effort, and the present moment.
*   **Ground the teaching in everyday, relatable experiences** rather than specialized spiritual jargon.
