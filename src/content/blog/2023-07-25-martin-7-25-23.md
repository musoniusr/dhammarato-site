### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so continue with that, Martin.

**Speaker B:** Oh, can you re-pot your video, Dhammarato? I can't see you.

**Speaker A:** All right. Did that do it?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we've been talking about concentration for a minute or two, so continue on with that.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so I was saying that I was, these last months, I was trying to do this concentration practice to see by myself if it was of value or not. And what I was seeing is that it's not very useful. I think sometimes it's not useful. Unless I find sometimes it's good when I have a sharp pain to be able to concentrate on something and forget the pain. But otherwise, it's— I don't see how you can learn really something when you are so much concentrated on something. And I think you're right, it can be done because sometimes I was so concentrated that sometimes when I woke up, I wasn't very, you know, aware of my surroundings, and there was a stair, and I almost walked on my rabbit. I have a bunny.

**Speaker A:** Great, okay. All right, well, I assume based upon a lot of evidence that The word concentration that is so common in Western Buddhism is actually based upon a bad translation of the word Samatha.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That the word Samatha actually in some cases translates to be exactly the opposite of concentration. That the word Samatha, what it actually means in the Suttas, Actually, to be honest with you, because it was so common a word in the Pali language, we don't find often an actual definition of the word Samatha in the Pali, but we do have a lot of evidence including Naropa and some of the later writings where they're trying to describe the Dharma to people who were speaking in other languages. And there you'll find actual definitions or descriptions of it. And that the actual definition or description of it in the Pali, but not part of the Suttas, it's in later literature, it says that Samadhi is like a yurt. Now the yurt is a tent that's used still in Mongolia, exactly. And that it's got a ridgepole in the middle. And at the top of that pole is where all of the other side poles are tied. This is also similar to a teepee or wigwam, or the kind of thing that was used in American housing for the American, let us say, Native Americans before the white people came. And that wigwam or teepee, it's got a lot of ridge poles, but they're tied together at the top to support one another. That you can have those poles just laying against each other and the teepee is going to fall apart. They have to be structurally tied together, and then they will support each other. Now there's two places where we can use this word Samadhi. One of them is in the Eightfold Noble Path, where the Buddha actually makes sure to talk about it in the sense of a unified mind, okay, when the mind is collected together. So let's talk about a unified mind for just a second. And that is, is that we can define a unified mind by talking about a not-unified mind. So a not-unified mind could have doubt. Is it this? Is it that? We're all over the place. Another usage of it would be that we are lying, that we don't like the truth, that we're divided with the truth. But when the mind is unified, that means that it's structurally sound, it's based in the truth, there's no doubt about it. Okay, so these are two ways of looking at the unified mind. Another way of using the unification of the word Samadhi is in the sense of the Jhana, or bringing the Jhana factors together. And what are the factors? One would be the removal of the hindrances. Number two, to have the kind of talking and language that brings upon a state of Sukkha, a state of well-being, so that we feel safe, secure, comfortable, relaxed, satisfied. And also with that, if we keep doing that over and over again, then that will bring a point of confidence to where we know that we can bring the mind and the body back into a state of Sukkha. And then we apply that and sustain it. Applied, sustained, Piti, the sense of "I've got this," Sukkha, the sense of well-being, and freedom from the hindrances. When we bring all of those things together in Samadhi, that's the first Jhana, and this is why it's called that. Also, Samatha, Samadhi, in that regard, are used together. Now let's look at the word concentration. There are various ways of using the word concentration, and That's not it. One example that I use is frozen concentrated orange juice. Why do they concentrate it? It's to get the water out of it, to make it easier to transport. But once you bring that frozen concentrated orange juice home and put it into a glass, you don't drink it like that. You want to make it actually no longer concentrated, you want to add the missing ingredient, water back to it. So you drink it as Samadhi, but you transport it as concentration.

**Speaker B:** And I was really trying that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's find another word, or another way of looking at the word concentrate, is that when we tell the kids to concentrate on their homework, what that means is, is that they need to pay attention to it and keep doing that. Or the way to talk about it is to repeat it. Once you do example 1, now you need to repeat and do example 2, and now you need to repeat and do example 3. So concentration has the quality of staying on something, like concentrating on staying on the beat. Can you hear my hand going? Okay, I'm going to change it a little bit, and that's going— I'm on the second beat, I'm going to put a triplet. Yeah, this is bolero. And now on the third beat, we're going to actually occasionally put three triplets. So we go Okay, so in order for that song to finish, the snare drummer who is giving that beat has to concentrate on doing that beat. But really, he's not concentrating. What he's doing is just repeating that same beat over and over and over and over and over again until the end of the piece. Okay, but we can use the word concentration like that if we're wanting to use the word concentration in meditation. What that means is paying attention to this thought, pay attention to this breath, pay attention to this feeling, pay attention to this thought, pay attention to this breath, pay attention to this feeling, etc., over and over and over and over and over again, rinse and repeat and rinse and repeat. However, most meditators use the wrong definition of the word concentration. And look like it in the sense of, oh, oh, here's an example. The young man is coding. He's sitting at his laptop computer writing PHP or C code or something like that, and his dad comes into the room and says good night, and the kid doesn't pay attention to his dad at all. He ignores his dad. He doesn't really ignore him. He's just concentrating on the code. His dad gets angry at him and slams the door, or maybe his mom comes into the room and he's concentrating on his code and she wants to wake him up. She wants to say goodnight to him and he won't pay attention to her and she slaps him in the back of the head. Okay, so another example of that would be the meditator who was sitting concentrating and a snake like a cobra or rattlesnake comes right up in front of them. Looks them over, and then bites them. And while the snake is biting, the guy doesn't move at all because he's too busy doing what he would think of as concentration. Now, I'll give you another story to emphasize this. This kid that we were talking about that's concentrating on his code, that is, let's say that he's 18 or 20 or something like that. Let's go back to a time when he was 6 or 7 years old, and he still is on his computer. But he knows his dad and his mom want him to go to sleep, and it's past his sleep time or past his bedtime. So the kid's there working on the computer, and he hears his dad come down the hall. He immediately turns the monitor off, jumps into bed by the time that they get to the door and open the door, and it looks like that he's asleep. Okay, so in one case, the first case, an older child who is concentrating, he's not paying attention to reality. Because he's too busy concentrating on his code.

**Speaker B:** It's exclusive.

**Speaker A:** But at the younger age, he was awake, he was wise, he was able to hear his folks coming down the hallway, and that was enough for him to jump. Okay, that would be more of a Samadhi mind, to be able to see what something's coming. And the guy who was writing the code at a later age, he's the one in concentration. So that'll give you the distinction between what is concentration and what is Samadhi. So what we're actually practicing now for Anapanasati is we're not practicing concentration, we're not practicing getting so stuck in something that we're missing everything else, that in fact we're going to be awake and aware for everything that happens so that we can deal with it wisely and happily.

**Speaker B:** And you know, the thing with concentration is that when I was trying it, I was very in a bad mood if someone was disturbing me, you know. I think of that as a disturbance, but when I'm doing what we do, together, when someone disturbs me, it's not a disturbance, it's just— It's not a disturbance, right.

**Speaker A:** The concentration is a disturbance because it pulls you off of what you want to do. So if you're just sitting there ready for anything, then when that happens, it's not a disturbance, it's, "Hi, how you doing? Glad to see you.".

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. And when I was doing the concentration, I was grumpy because I was, "Hey, you 'You fucked up my concentration, I'm concentrating, hey, hey!' And I was in more bad mood than before. But to be honest, I am not very good at it, so I think the guys that doing it, they do it for like 10 years before they can do something with it, I don't know. It's too hard.

**Speaker A:** Let's put it this way, the society that we live in, is a grumpy society. Okay, that grumpiness is common, and when people get old, they're called like grumpy old men. Now the grumpiness is already there, but when Western people come into Buddhism and they hear about concentration, they start concentrating, they get even more grumpy, not less.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this grumpiness is, first off, it's an already developed habit. Yes. And so, being distracted from your concentration is grumpy, or one gets grumpy because they're already in the habit of being grumpy.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That if they're practicing correctly, then they're concentrating on being happy, Even when they're distracted, they can become happy. They don't have to be grumpy. And so in a way, we're actually practicing the wrong thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And that was the thing that helped me to see it, is that it's Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And when I was doing the concentration, I was where is the end of suffering, where is the end of dissatisfaction? I'm more in Dukkha than before, so it's not worth it for now, it's not worth it for me. I don't want to talk for anybody else.

**Speaker A:** I would say that this mistake, this number one mistake, is the number one problem of why people don't get get the real benefit, they don't get the real Dharma, is because they're full of desire, they're wanting things, they're wanting Jhanas, they're wanting Srotapanna, they're wanting Arahant, they're wanting freedom from suffering without even understanding what that means. And so here they are concentrating in an unwholesome state, making things even worse.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I have a question about that, Dhammarato. What is the right attitude? Oh, you are froze. Okay, it's good. When you change an unwelcome thought to a wholesome thought, okay, how do you do it without wanting the unwelcome thought to go away? How do you do it? What is the right attitude to not be in aversion?

**Speaker A:** All right, the answer to that is that when the aversion comes, or when the thoughts, the unwholesome thoughts, we can say— and the Buddha actually used this term, this is the one from the Buddha, this is how he practiced— he would say, "Aha, I see you, Mara." "Aha, I can see that unwholesome thought and I'm very happy that I can see it as opposed to being disappointed that it's there." that we were disappointed when it was there all along. That's our old habits. That's the way that we've been concentrating on it. And now we're going to make a change so that I can see it and be happy that I can see it rather than being disappointed because it's there. Be happy we can see it. Aha, I see you. Aha, I can see you, Mr. Wart. Aha, I can see you, Mr. Ouch. Aha, I can see you, Mr. Grumpy. Because if we can see it, then we have a chance, a choice to change it.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Arahant] But if we're concentrating on it, we've got no choice, we're just concentrating on it. Now you mentioned a point a while back, in the sense of, because you've got a particular pain, you decide that you want to, concentrate on something else so that you can deal with the pain better. That's a typical way that people do it because they've heard of the word concentration and they're practicing Buddhism and all of that. But there's a much, much better way to do it, and that is by intentionally and happily get distracted getting distracted by something else, like for instance, your leg hurts, and instead of concentrating on something else, like the other leg, or looking at the pain or the sensation itself, watching a video will distract you, and the pain is not there. "Oh, it doesn't hurt now, because I'm being distracted by something else." Okay, and if I will stay on that distraction and continue to watch the movie, continue to repeat, repeat, repeat, I'm in the movie, I'm in the movie, I'm in the movie, all of that time we're not paying attention to the pain in the leg. But if we are there concentrating on something to avoid the pain in the leg, we still keep going back to the pain in the leg. And we're not happy. Yes, we're not happy. So the way to do it is by becoming distracted. Well, one of the things that the Buddha recommends to get distracted on is the breathing, because it's a very interesting story, this in-breath and this out-breath, and this breath is different than that breath, and it's kind of got a story to it. We can make it long and we can make it short and we can make it easy etc., like that. And while we're playing with or being distracted from the pain by the breathing, we don't have to deal with the pain. And so being distracted is much better than concentrating on something else.

**Speaker B:** It's the intention that is different.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the happiness. Oh, I don't need to worry about the pain. I've got a movie to watch. Let me watch this movie. I'm having fun here.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right.

**Speaker A:** And so this is an easy way to look at it, is that we don't need this word concentration in our vocabulary at all, but since it's there, I could just distract from it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but you know, it was worth it to try it and to see by myself, because now I have a better understanding of what it why it is wrong. So before, when I was sitting, sometimes I was in my head saying, oh, maybe I should do that, I should do that, I should concentrate more, maybe I should concentrate more. But now that I try, really try for a month, I can see that now for myself it's not working. So it's— I don't know what to say, I'm very bad sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, no, you're saying it very clearly, very clearly. This would be a good video for those people who were, let us say, practicing the Mahasi Method or practicing some sort of concentration meditation, that they're not getting the better benefits out of that practice. Yeah, yes, in fact, they're missing a lot of stuff. Another example that I would use would be the whack-a-mole. Have you ever seen the whack-a-mole machines? They have them in arcades or the lobbies of restaurants— not restaurants, but grocery stores and places like that. Okay, so the young kid is learning to play whack-a-mole, and he's decided that he's going to concentrate on one of the holes so that every time that mole comes up out of that hole, he's going to hit it every time. He's concentrating on it. But he's missing all of the other 15. If we concentrate too focused on that— the example is this whack-a-mole machine— he's going to only get a few of them. His percentage is going to be very low. No, you've got to expand your awareness so that you're ready for that one up there and this one over here and that one over there and this one over here, and you can get them. Because you're watching what's going on. No concentration necessary, but the repetitive kind of concentration is needed to keep hitting this one, and then hit that one, and then hit this one, and then hit that one, and stay on it, and keep doing it. That's the only use of the word concentration, and it would be much better to use the word repetition rather than concentration. Because concentration means to take a whole bunch of stuff out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, an exclusive focus.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm glad we got that one straightened out. That was easy to do.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so now where do we go? Oh, back into repetition. There's no place to go. We just keep coming back and doing it over and over and over again. But in fact, that's a common question that students ask, is, "Well, what do we do next?" The answer is, don't do something different next, repeat next. Keep coming back to it and coming back to it. There is no place to go. Don't think that, "Oh, after I've gotten no place to go, what's next?" Because that's going someplace else. No, we can come back to no place to go. It's a very easy way to look at it, is that there is no place to go, there is nothing next, just repeat, just keep doing it over and over again, and soon by doing that, we get into now a new habit, and the new habit is awareness, paying attention, and also the new habit is the feeling of success, "I can do this, I can repeat." Originally, we were talking about Bolero and the beat of the full piece of music. Actually, this is broken down into— oh, I forgot how many, but I do know that the flute, the oboe, the trombone, and several other instruments will take the lead and repeat the same thing over and over again until the end of the music, where the whole orchestra is playing that thing together. And then they are. They end the piece in a great big. And then it stops. Okay? Now, the point is, is that the snare drummer keeps that beat going, that bump. And he has to keep repeating repeating that over and over and over again. If he stops, the director of the band will stop and say, "What happened? You didn't keep going!" And the "keep going" is the repetition, the repetition. And many meditators say, "Well, I'm the snare drummer, we're in the middle of Bolero, and now I want to play Beethoven." No, we don't go to Beethoven, we're going to finish this piece. We're going to stay with this one, we're going to repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. This is the way of thinking, not concentration, but repetition. That's why I say it several times, I'm doing the same thing. In fact, I've said it, it's 25 minutes into our talk, and I've only said one thing that I could have said in about one minute, and I've repeated it 25 times. One topic, repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. That's the value of repetition, and that's the value of concentration, is to bring the mind into repeating it, is that it brings great joy. I keep going, I keep doing it, I can do it, I can do it, I can do this, I am the winner here, I can do this. Is the feeling that's built up through that repetition.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But in concentration practice, "Oh, I'm a failure," "Oh, I lost it," "Oh, I've lost my concentration," "Oh, I've got to go get it again." And so concentration is actually based in failure, and repetition is based in success. And you've just proved to yourself that. You took a month to figure it out, huh? It took me about 15 years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but you helped me a lot. I saw your video and I— In fact, the thing was, I have a rule, and my rule was no concentration, you see? So I have to see for myself. It's not a rule, it's just that it doesn't work.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't work, not the way that it's been taught. In Western Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the way I have understood it doesn't work, but the way you talk about it works.

**Speaker A:** It works, it works, and that's what we're looking for. We're looking for, "Hey, this works!".

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That feeling of, "Wow, this stuff does work, the Dharma is good.".

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Now I know what there is to do. I understand what is and what is not the path. Concentration is not the path, repetition is the path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was really great to feel it for myself, to say, no, concentration is not the path. I was like, okay, okay, now I can, now I have no doubt about it, you see.

**Speaker A:** Without a doubt.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Loss of the doubt, and now I know that repetition of coming back to the wholesome, coming back to the wholesome, coming back to the wholesome. That gives joy, that gives satisfaction, and eventually that gives success. But concentration always brings us back into, oh, this is hard.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And yet the mind can get naturally concentrated.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** In fact, in the story that we were telling about the kid doing the code on his laptop in the bedroom, he was actually in a natural state of concentration, which means the house could have burned down and he wouldn't have known it. He was too concentrated. That in fact, what a good computer scientist needs to do is the same thing that everybody, all mothers do. Mothers are good mothers when they can take care of this distraction happily, and then come back and repeat whatever they were doing—washing the dishes—and then they can be distracted happily, and then come back later and keep doing it. If she's concentrating on washing the dishes and that distraction, like her kids having a fit or maybe dying, and she doesn't want to stop washing the dishes, she wants to concentrate on that, that's why we call it in that way, a distraction. But when we have real Samadhi, it's not a distraction, it's just part of the show. There it is.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's true, even the word distraction has Dukkha in it. Distraction is something you don't like, so if you look for distraction or you try to not have distraction, you are in aversion, you don't want.

**Speaker A:** You are in aversion, exactly. Exactly so. That's another way of pointing out that concentration doesn't work as a meditation practice.

**Speaker B:** So I was calling you to say that concentration doesn't work, right?

**Speaker A:** And we spent 30 minutes repeating that same thing over and over and over again, and there's been no concentration here. It's all been just repetition, happy repetition. Teaching, over and over again. And so now we've got it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, actually.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for calling about this, this is really great.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. So, call again soon and we'll continue. But I'm glad that you've finally gotten concentration out of your system. You recognize it doesn't work.

**Speaker B:** It's liberating.

**Speaker A:** It is liberating, that understanding of, oh, I don't have to be confused. Do I practice repetition or do I practice concentration? You now know that concentration has a disadvantage.

**Speaker B:** Yes, clearly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you, Dhammarato. Bye-bye, have a great day.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend named Martin (Speaker B), centers on a critical examination of the concept of **"concentration"** in meditation, contrasting it with the authentic Buddhist concept of **Samadhi**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Problem: The Misunderstanding of "Concentration"
*   **Martin's Experience:** He shares that after trying dedicated concentration practice for months, he found it unhelpful and even counterproductive. It made him grumpy when disturbed, less aware of his surroundings (almost stepping on his pet rabbit), and generally increased his suffering (*dukkha*).
*   **Root Cause:** Dhammarato identifies the issue as a widespread **bad translation** of the Pali term **Samatha** (calm, tranquility) and **Samadhi** (unification, collectedness) as "concentration" in Western Buddhism.

### The True Meaning of Samadhi
Dhammarato explains Samadhi using two key analogies:
1.  **A Unified Mind (Like a Tent):** Samadhi is like a yurt or teepee, where all the poles (mental factors) are tied together at the top, creating a stable, unified, and structurally sound structure. A unified mind is based in truth, free from doubt, and not divided against itself.
2.  **The First Jhana:** Samadhi in this sense is the bringing together of specific factors: removal of hindrances, applied and sustained attention, joy (*piti*), happiness/well-being (*sukkha*), and a unified mind. This is a state of collected, aware ease.

### "Concentration" vs. "Repetition" vs. "Distraction"
The talk carefully distinguishes these concepts:
*   **Concentration (The Problematic Kind):** This is an **exclusive, narrow focus** that shuts out the world. It's likened to:
    *   A programmer so absorbed in code he ignores his parent.
    *   A meditator so focused he wouldn't notice a snake biting him.
    *   **Result:** It creates aversion to distractions, increases grumpiness, and is based on a feeling of **failure** ("I lost my concentration").
*   **Repetition (The Helpful Practice):** This is the **joyful, relaxed return** to an object (like the breath) again and again. It's likened to:
    *   A snare drummer steadily repeating the beat throughout Ravel's *Boléro*.
    *   The core of the practice: "there is no place to go... just repeat."
    *   **Result:** It builds confidence, joy, and a feeling of **success** ("I can do this").
*   **Skillful Distraction (A Useful Tool):** Instead of *concentrating* to avoid pain, it's more effective to **happily get distracted** by something wholesome (like a movie or the breath). This reframes the event from an unwanted interruption to part of the flow of experience.

### Right Attitude and Key Insights
*   **Attitude Towards Unwholesome Thoughts:** Don't meet them with aversion. Instead, adopt the Buddha's attitude: **"Aha, I see you, Mara!"** Be happy you've noticed the thought, because seeing it gives you the choice to change it.
*   **The Grumpy Society:** The talk observes that modern society already cultivates grumpiness, and wrong "concentration" practice often amplifies this habit rather than alleviating it.
*   **Liberating Realization:** For Martin, experientially proving to himself that forced concentration doesn't work was **liberating**. It removed doubt and clarified the path: the path is **the joyful repetition of returning to the wholesome**, not the strained exclusion of everything else.

### Conclusion
The talk concludes that the term "concentration" should be largely abandoned in meditation vocabulary in favor of understanding **Samadhi as a unified, aware, and happy mind**, and the practice as **gentle, confident repetition**. This approach leads to well-being (*sukkha*) and reduces suffering (*dukkha*), while the common misinterpretation of concentration often increases suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Yurt/Teepee Metaphor (for Samadhi)**
This is the central metaphor. Samadhi is compared to a **yurt** (or a teepee/wigwam). The key point is that the structure's stability comes from all the poles being **tied together at the top**, supporting one another. This represents a **unified mind**—where various mental factors (truthfulness, absence of doubt, well-being) are integrated into a single, stable, and supportive structure. It's the opposite of a scattered or conflicted mind.

**2. Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (for Misunderstood "Concentration")**
This metaphor critiques the common Western interpretation of concentration. Like **frozen orange juice concentrate**, which has the water removed for transport, this type of concentration is a condensed, dehydrated state. To be useful (to drink it), you must **add water back**—i.e., you must expand awareness and reconnect with context. Meditation should be the "drinkable" state (Samadhi), not the cramped, exclusive state of transport (concentration).

**3. The Bolero Snare Drummer (for Repetition vs. Concentration)**
The speaker references Ravel's **Bolero**, where the snare drummer plays a simple, repetitive rhythm throughout the entire piece. This isn't about intense, narrow focus, but about **steady, unwavering repetition**. The meditator's task is similar: not to clamp down on one thing, but to patiently and consistently return to the object (like the breath) again and again.

**4. The Programmer and the Parent (Two Stories Contrasting States)**
*   **The Older Programmer:** A young man is deeply absorbed in coding. His parent says goodnight, but he is so "concentrated" he doesn't respond, leading to frustration. This illustrates **bad concentration**—exclusive, unaware of surroundings, and causing conflict.
*   **The Younger Child:** As a boy, he hears his parent coming down the hall past his bedtime. He quickly turns off his computer and jumps into bed, feigning sleep. This illustrates **Samadhi**—a unified, aware, and responsive mind that perceives the situation and skillfully adapts.

**5. The Meditator and the Snake**
A brief, hyperbolic story of a meditator in deep "concentration" who is bitten by a cobra or rattlesnake and doesn't react. This starkly illustrates the **danger of wrong concentration**—it creates a state of obliviousness that is the opposite of mindful awareness.

**6. Whack-a-Mole (for Awareness vs. Narrow Focus)**
A child playing **whack-a-mole** who decides to concentrate on just one hole will miss all the others. To succeed, you need **broad, flexible awareness** to see all the holes and respond skillfully. This contrasts narrow concentration with the expansive, ready awareness of true Samadhi.

**7. The Mother Washing Dishes**
A good mother can **happily be interrupted** by her children and then return to her task. This represents the ideal meditative mind: engaged but not attached, able to handle "distractions" without aversion and seamlessly return to repetition. If she were "concentrating" on the dishes and refused to respond to her child, it would be a failure.

**Core Narrative & Contrast:**
The entire talk is built on a **master metaphor of contrast**:
*   **Concentration (Wrong Practice):** Illustrated by frozen juice, the oblivious programmer, the snake bite, grumpiness, failure, and aversion to "distractions."
*   **Samadhi/Repetition (Right Practice):** Illustrated by the yurt, the snare drummer's repetition, the alert child, the responsive mother, joy, success, and liberating understanding.

The speaker's goal is to replace the common cultural metaphor for meditation ("concentration" as laser-like focus) with a more accurate and fruitful set of metaphors centered on **unification, repetition, and open, joyful awareness.**
