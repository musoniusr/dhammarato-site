### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so we had started, guys. By the way, welcome and thank you for coming on our— for me, Saturday morning call, for you guys, mostly Friday evenings. Yeah, so if you know any flat earthers, show them this video. With the sun shining right behind. So, uh, and by the way, do you hear the birds? No, I don't.

**Speaker B:** Oh no.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so we, we have a forest setting here. Actually, in Thailand, it's not a forest so much, and it's not a farm so much. It's an intermingling of the two, where the forest was never really cleared. People just came in and planted stuff and then cleared a little bit and then planted some more, and now it's half wild and half cultivated. So we've got banana trees over there and papayas over there. We just lost an Anagami tree. We've got coconut palms, fan palms. This is a naturally occurring sim tree right here.

**Speaker B:** Are there avocados there?

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, absolutely. We have fresh avocados grown, I mean, within 24 hours of picking, we have them open and eating. They're grown right here on the island. And not only that, but they're cheap.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, here in Mexico they should be, they should be cheap, but because of the narcos and all of the organized crime, they are so expensive. But they, they taste so sweet.

**Speaker A:** Which organized crime that are you talking about? The one that people run away from or the one they vote for? Yeah, no, the one that everyone run away from. Is this recording— does it go on YouTube? Yes. Do you mind?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess, I guess not.

**Speaker A:** I'll be more, uh, careful with what I say then. Oh, well, that's it. That's exactly— and look how many videos have been done. Look how careful I have to be. That, in fact, another way of saying careful, which sounds like a lot of work is to be, let us say, to pay attention. But even paying has that quality of work. So the real easy part is just to be here now, which is also paying attention and being careful because you're watching what's going on. So all we have to do is take the work out of it and sure, be careful, but be careful easily and happily. Be careful with the toy because you're going to break it anyway someday if you play with it enough. Scott, what do you have?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was going to say, like, the only reason you feel like a little bit like you might be a little bit embarrassed if something you say goes on YouTube is because you don't realize that everyone who's ever going to watch that video, including yourself, is going to die. And it's not going to— it has no inherent— it's not like you're dooming yourself to the permanent record of what you said in this video. Most likely, most of the people are going to watch it are going to forget about it in like 2 minutes right after they saw it.

**Speaker A:** Anyways, precisely so. Uh, probably less than 2 minutes. But the, uh, another part about that is, is that when this video that is being made now is actually physically published on YouTube, all of the participants who were on that YouTube video are already dead. Sure, something new has come by. In fact, there may be some dying and rebirthing right here on this video. And so the topic that we have for the day is about— you use the word dependent origination, Scott, and the word dependent origination has to really be picked apart in order to even understand what it is, when in fact it's really something very simple, and that is cause and effect. Everything that is affected is affected because— and there's the word— because there is a causality, and that it is so deep into our language that the word because is a very common word. Looking at the idea of cause and effect, well, there's something a little bit more complicated with it than that. And that is, is that things are not necessarily cause, or there's a, let us say, a spectrum of the word cause that goes from hardcore causing down to conditionality and even down to catalyst. Now, what a catalyst is, is a catalyst will set two other chemical reactions off while maintaining its own stability. And that's what the job is of a catalytic converter. If a catalytic converter got eaten up by the fumes of a car and we had to replace the catalytic converter very often, then that would be a no-brainer. We wouldn't buy them, right? But we do have catalytic converters in the car because they are, in fact, stable. But they do cause a chemical reaction. In other chemicals that are part of the smoke. Does that make sense? Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So 3 levels of cause and effect. There's direct cause and effect, like let's say I roll a marble and it bangs into another marble, like that marble.

**Speaker A:** Right. The domino. Right. Yeah. Right. And this is in fact, when we get the idea of the domino, we lose much of the complexity of the situation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Because we think that it's just a direct cause and a direct effect, and that's all there is to it, where things can be much more complicated and sophisticated than that when we get down into causality and catalyze it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So then the second one, conditions, that opens up a multiplicity of dimensions in which things are affecting each other. So There can be one condition for something to happen. There could be two, or there could be up until an infinite amount of right conditions for something to happen.

**Speaker A:** For example, in order for— Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** In order for, yeah, in order for like ice to melt, the surrounding atmosphere needs to be a certain temperature. That's one condition. But also, there's multiple conditions in order for ice to melt. There has to be a certain pressure. If it's the right temperature, but the pressure is too hard, the ice won't melt.

**Speaker A:** Right now you're getting into science and we're talking about the conditionality of things rather than— okay, there's many, many examples of that. One of the little simple examples I have is you've got lemonade and all you have to do is add sugar, water, and ice. And so now you've got lemonade. Yeah. Okay. What that means is, is that we add whatever lemon that comes by in the moment. We can add joy to it. That's the sugar. We can add Nibbana to it. That's the ice. Just cool off. And then the water we add to it, which dilutes it, which makes it not as important as it was when lemon juice is raw. It's really an important taste, but when it's got mixed with water, it's diluted. So that's the whole way then of dealing with the, uh, uh, lemonade is the same way we deal with the lemonade in the mind. Okay, we cool off, we put some, uh, wind energy in it. That would be also the water to dilute it. Take them some deep breaths, cool off, and, um, As we cool off, that's the Nibbana. So we add the ice, we add the sugar. So though, but neither of those three things directly caused lemonade. It took all four things, right? Otherwise you got just sweet water without the lemon. So if we look at it from that perspective, we can see that all there are these all kinds of conditionalities that occur. And this is the thing that we have to look for in the mind, because when people look at the teaching of the Buddha that is called Paticcasamuppada and then translate it wrongly as dependent origination, that dependency sounds like it is a hard cause. And it's not. These are conditionalities, not causes. And it's important when we understand Paticcasamuppada, how things interrelate that way. That if we think that is a step-by-step, exactly series of events, then we will not understand the teaching very well. Because the mind has various components that interact with one another as to form a whole or a unit, very much like— oh, you can see that in the body, that there is a whole huge session called digestion, there's a huge section called cardiovascular, there's a huge section called brain. There's a huge section called breathing apparatus and all the muscles that are associated with holding all of that stuff together. And then we got a waste and byproduct system called the kidneys and the liver and pancreas and all of that kind of stuff. And you see that all of these various components fit together to make a human being, that you can't just take many pounds of intestines and arrange them around in a way to make a human being. You can't do it like that. You've got to have all of these various components. And that's another way of looking at Paticcasamuppada, is that there are various components that fit together. Now, if that's the case, then that means that we don't have to consider it, even though it's taught in a certain order, that this causes this, causes this, causes this. Doesn't mean that we have to keep seeing it that way. Now we can see that these things fit together. So the way that Paticcasamuppada starts off is in fact broken down into two major groups. One group is called the aggregates. There's five of the aggregates, and then the result of those five aggregates coming into combination gives the rest of Paticcasamuppada in the sense of when something contacts us, We have feelings about it. Those feelings will attract us or repel us. And then so we start to wanting and grasping to get rid of it or to get a hold of it. And then we really want it. So it goes from want to need and from the need, that's when we are reborn into a deprived individual because we're in a state of need. Okay, so that's basically the sequence of events that happened. That's the rebirth process, is where we are reborn as something needy. And so those are known as the woeful states. One of the woeful states is hell. Another woeful state is a hungry ghost, and that's the place that many people wind up. Another place, the most frequent for Westerners is the dumb animal. They don't even know what that dumb animal is. But I can express it in the sense of going along to get along. You do what you're told to do. You don't like it, but you do it anyway. Maybe there's going to be a reward someplace in the future. But right now, in this present moment, this is work and I don't like it, but I got to do it. Okay, so that's the state of being deprived. And then the other one, the Asuras, is the warriors who are all dressed up for battle with no place to go. They don't want to go to battle. I mean, what warrior actually wants to go to battle? Very rarely is that true. Maybe 1 or 2 warriors out of 100 or so. Maybe a centurion wants to go to battle. Everybody else doesn't want to go to battle. Okay. And so this is the state. That we were in. In some ways, that would mean that if you are very close friends with someone who has done something wrong, rather than coming clean, you would cover for him. That's an example of Yashura. Another example of that would be the stage fright that a young child has when he walks out on the stage dressed as a tree And his only line is, I am a tree, and he forgets. Why? This is called stage fright, butterflies in the stomach, agitation, worry. That sort of thing is the state of being afraid, which is different than anger. Then in fact, you can see that they're close together in the sense that that hell is being desperately trying to get out of a situation that you're in right now and you can't stand it. Really, what you're wanting to do is to say, I want you to give me what I want, or I want you to agree with me. All right. And I cannot stand it if you don't do that for me. So this is what anger is, is it actually is a state of desperation. Which is what it would actually be like if you were in real hell. If you were in real hell, wouldn't you be really desperate to get out of there? Yeah. So it's a state of real desperation that works us up into that very heavy-duty survival instinct. It's really all based upon fear. Fear is the primary motivator down in there. So let's go back to the Paticcasamuppada and look at the sequence of events, both the basis that it has and then the ending of it. Or I'm on a call.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Basically what we're talking about is, have you ever heard of General Systems Theory? General Systems Theory. Right, with closed systems and open systems. Yeah. Okay. And one of the qualities of a system that makes it a system is that the sum is greater than— or the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, you have something that these parts don't mean anything, but when you put them together, a clock or car— clocks have functionality. And when you put these things together, then they function in a certain way. And if you put them together in another way, they'll function differently. This is what the whole concept of transformers are all about, is that you make the thing so that you can bend it and twist it and wheels come out. And the next thing you know, you twist it and now you've got a giant gorilla-like tall dude. And all of that kind of stuff is because of the way that things are put together. And so let's look at those components and the way that we're going to put them together normally winds up in unhappiness and Dukkha. And so the five constituent components that the Buddha talks about, the five aggregates, is the body, the feeling, the mind, and broken down into three ways. That is consciousness, perception, and memories. Now, these are English language. In Nepali, it's kaya, Vedana, Sanyata, Vinaya, and Samskara. And the word Samskara is actually the word for all of our memories or all of our stored stuff. And that when we start off the sequence of Piti, Samuppada, you've probably seen enough of it to know that it starts with ajiva, or ignorance. And what that really means is, is that our ignorance conditions us in the present moment because we don't know everything. And therefore this memory now is conditioned by that ignorance. So when I pile one memory after another after another on over and over and over again, by piling that stuff up, that's the— that's the whole story of the Samskara. That's what that is. We can easily refer to it in English language as a set of habits, a set of memories, and one of the important points is that we actually feel generally the way that we have developed our habits of feeling. In other words, instead of actually paying attention to how we feel and choosing how we feel, we just let the old habit run our feelings. This is the way that I felt last time. I'll do it again because that's my normal reaction. My action is just an old action that I've taken before. The pathways are cut in the mind to do all of that. Subroutines are already written, so to speak. We don't have to write a new subroutine. And actually then the whole Buddhist teaching of the Buddha would be how to write your own code, how to write your own subroutine so that you can put the code in that you want to have, put up some new stuff rather than using the old software. Need a software upgrade is a way of saying it. OK, so this is now the way of looking at the five aggregates, the body, the feelings, the Samskara, the perception, and the consciousness, is that there is no self in any of it. Many people identify who I am is my past. Okay, who I am is my past. Well, yes, if that's true, then what we're actually saying is, is who I am is the sum total of all the lies I've been told. And a few bits of truth sprinkled in that I've had to figure out on my own. So, um, the fact is, is no, everybody's a moving target, that that's a delusion to think that we are who we used to be, but we're all moving targets. Hello, Ron.

**Speaker B:** Hey, how's it going?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I didn't know it was playing with rituals again there, guys. Yes, glad to see you. We were talking about dependent origination and how, um, that The Five Aggregates fit in exactly into dependent origination, which is basically what we're talking about, is that it's not a cause and effect, but it's more of mutual conditionalities. And when we understand it that way, it's much easier to work with because in fact you can think of it like this, that the Five Aggregates that we're beginning to discuss are just an adaptation of the four foundations of mindfulness, the Satipatthana, which is the body, the feeling, the mind, and the mind's objects. But here we're not working with the mind objects because the mind objects are the product of the other three, which are real things, and that these three things are actually— one of them is broken down into three groups. We're still talking about Paticcasamuppada and the Five Aggregates and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness all at the same time, because we're talking about all of the— you know, this is it. It's just three different ways of looking at it, sort of like good in the beginning, the Satipatthana, good in the middle, the Five Aggregates, and good in the end would be the Paticcasamuppada and how all of this stuff fits in together. So these five aggregates, there is the important point is, is that individually there is no self there. Let's use the example of the self being transportation. That is what a car does. And this is an adaptation with in the suttas where Nagasena was taking a chariot apart, but we're going to take a car apart because a chariot, the quality of a chariot or a car is, is that it has a form of transportation. But if you take that chariot apart, where is the chariot? If the charioteer is the transportation itself. Okay, so then now we're talking about the distinction between structure and function. There is the structure, in fact, the structure of the brain. And then there's the functions. And the functions have to do to do with the structure of the brain and how they interrelate. Just like the functions of all of these components, the structure of the automobile come together in certain ways to create transportation. Okay. And so when we put these five aggregates together, the outcome then is the self, me. But the constituent components, there is no self in there anywhere. That's the important point. In other words, I am not my memories. And many people confuse that. A lot of people say, oh, well, when I was 5 years old, not recognizing, no, that was just a child. You just happen to have a lot of memories of that child right in the present. But you are not that child. Not one molecule in your body, not one cell is the same Not one neuron is still existing. Nothing about you. I'm sorry, you froze there. Can you say again?

**Speaker C:** I said it's just the brain that remembers.

**Speaker A:** Ah, it's just data.

**Speaker B:** The brain is a concept. Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, no, the brain is physical. The mind is just a concept.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Brain is physical, but you experience the mind. You don't experience the brain. Well, you, you can look at a brain. You can look— isn't that interesting? Right.

**Speaker A:** Here's something really funny. Can a camera take a picture of itself?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Well, not without a mirror, right? But now you've added a distortion. You've added a reflection. It's not— so the answer is cameras can't take a picture of themselves. It doesn't matter what you do. Well, that same thing with the brain and the mind. You— the mind cannot see the brain. It cannot see the structure in which it lives in, is just the function. That's almost the same as the ticking of the clock is unaware of the clock. All it's doing is ticking, and it thinks magically that there's no clock there. Or in the case of the humans, we think magically that the ticking of the mind is me, which is the body. And a lot of people get confused that I am the body. And you can see, in fact, that I am the body makes a lot of business, a lot of money. Look how many industries are in business simply because of people under the delusion I am the body. How about the cosmetic industry? How about the shoe industry? How about the bag industry? How about the fashion industry as a whole? And cosmetics and hair salons, and the list goes on all the way down to, in many cases, medical doctors and pills. And dieting and food supplements and yada yada yada yada. I would say maybe 30 to 40% of our entire economy is based upon I am the body delusion that people have. All right, now we can see instead that it's not I am the body, but rather I, whoever I am, which is not the point, am the custodian and the guest in the body. And it is my job to take care of this body.

**Speaker C:** You know how I like to see it? It's like a— experience taking place in awareness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, say it again. You broke up.

**Speaker C:** I said awareness is not an experience happening in the body. The body is an experience happening in awareness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** That's very Hindu, but it's very true. The body is actually nothing but a concept.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my body, that's what I said.

**Speaker A:** There is a physical body, but most of the time we think of it conceptually. So, we also see that the feelings that arise are not me. People will go around in our community saying, "I am angry," or "I'm frustrated," or "I'm sad," or "I'm joyful," but in fact, sadness just comes and goes. Why does it have to come with a self? How about anger? When I am angry, what does that mean? That the 'I' is just sitting there and whatever emotion comes up, the 'I' just becomes that emotion. If that's the case, then the emotions run the show, not the 'I.' And so that's delusional to say, 'I am angry.' You couldn't possibly say that. The more correct thing to say is that I see anger. Or there is anger is even more correct. There is anger. Yeah, I know what to feel like when I feel angry. When I feel angry, you hear that? So the point is, is that there is no I in the feelings. There's no I in the body. And then the one that's the kind of tough one for most of us is the I am not the consciousness. That in fact this is a major sutta, number 38, that is actually a major teaching on the Paticcasamuppada. Starts off with Sati, son of a fisherman, confusing that it is consciousness that runs and goes from place to place experiencing the results of good and past actions from the past. So The Buddha actually called him— I forgot the word in Nepali for it— basically a doof or an idiot. And then he asked the monks around, does Sati have even a shred of wisdom? And the monks all said, not a shred, he's off. No, that in fact the consciousness is not who I am. And yet this is actually a major teaching in Christianity. Who is it, or what is it, that goes to heaven? Well, they'll say immediately and write off it's a soul, right? But a soul by itself, if a soul is what it looks like it is, it's got no eyes, it's got no ears, it's got no legs, it's got no walking around abilities at all. How would a soul know that is in heaven if it arrives there? It's a very interesting question. Ah, it's because in my mind perceiving heaven now, I perceive that me has ability to see, which is this sight consciousness, or the ability to hear, or the ability to feel. I know that I'm in heaven because I can see it, feel it, experience it. Right. Okay. Well, here's the point is that that's just merely a concept that whatever a soul is, it's got no eyes. Now, before satellites and still even with satellites, because in satellites they've got no eyes, satellites have cameras. We need to know the difference between a camera and an eye. But they talk about eyes in the sky. There's no eyes in the sky. There is nothing watching. Your location. Not a god, at least not a Kamma machine for sure. That in fact, actions and reactions happen because of the way of the mind functioning. And the reality is, is that consciousness itself is dependently arising. What do we mean by dependently arising is that eyes require light, it requires an object. And that is what we mean by eye consciousness is seeing. That's something that a camera kind of simulates. But this camera can't go any further than that kind of seeing. In other words, now it takes basically AI to interpret, is this a face? And if it is, who in my database Does this face closely match? And so I can come up with an identification. Okay. Once that identification is made, that's a new kind of consciousness. Now I know what it is. So an example of consciousness in this regard is, is that I look out and I say, I see a tree. And when I get a tree in my mind, that's already processed. That what I saw with the eye of sight, the consciousness was just an object. The eyes did that seeing. And now a new process has to occur. And that new process is what we call perception, or making sense out of it, or making it a name. We name an object, we put a handle on it. Okay, the handle that we put on things is actually not actually on that thing. And these handles is how we store our memories. And so much of this is actually mental creations. And, uh, this mental creation system that we have is called perception. And perception requires input from consciousness— the ear, the eye, the nose, all of that stuff. And the memory base, the Samskara, to make sense out of it based upon our past, and we come up with something new. Well, that's something new that we have in the Paticcasamuppada is called the Salyatana, but that's a product of all of these five aggregates: the body, which houses the eyes, the feelings, which is the chemistry of the body and chemistry of the brain. That's all feelings are, is just whatever chemicals you got going on. You got some acid or you got some base or you've got some water. Up to you. OK, and then the Perception is just a mechanism, but it's not you. You're not consciousness. Consciousness is dependently arising. Sometimes we're looking at the house, sometimes we're looking at the car, sometimes we're looking at the girls, sometimes the laptop. At each one of those is a different consciousness. But when we're asleep at night or when the eyes are closed, we have no eye consciousness going on. Interesting. So there's just nothing there. There's no self, there's no essence to it. It's just a process. And so now we have all 5 of those areas, not one self in there, but when we put those together, it creates a mental image or a conception or a thought or whatever like that in the mind. And that thought then is what affects us. Okay.

**Speaker C:** The brain's reaction to the raw sensations.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** That's what we're attached to.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so that is that Salyatana or that internal representation of the external thing that we get. That is then called Pasa. Or contact, and often that contact is strong and sometimes it's weak. It depends upon how we react to our internal image, but how we react was based upon the Samskara, our past anyway, so that the way that we're going to react to this is more than likely how we had reacted before, because that's how the Samskara was fed into the Salyatana through perception.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I thought of something that's kind of Hindu, but you— what it kind of reminded me of it, that Samskara is the belief or trying to get happiness from Nama Rupa or name and form. So anything that can be viewed as having a form or a name, including consciousness, is ultimately like a mirage or an illusion that's made out of emptiness, where the happiness is the emptiness that all the names and the forms are arisen from. So it's kind of like all the names and forms are already imbued with the happiness that you're searching for. But if you try to get it out of a specific thing, like in the world or a specific mind state or specific desire, it'd just be endless. It'll be endless cycle of suffering that just goes on forever.

**Speaker A:** We can call that doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a new result. Or another way of saying it, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. All right, that keeps us sad and depressed and unhappy, expecting new results and never getting them, because we're not looking at what we're doing. And so this is why this teaching is there, so we can begin to see how the mind works so that we can look at what we're doing and recognizing that, oh, everything that ever has contacted me was something that I invented from scratch. Very, very little real input and a whole lot of processing and a whole lot of storage going on. And what we need to do is to reverse that process so that we have a whole lot of input going on, not much processing, and not much results, just enjoying the show. Be surprised at the end of the murder mystery. You don't have to figure it out through the book, just enjoy it. Just enjoy the murder mystery.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's usually going to be the person who seems the least likely to do it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole reason that they do the books like that, is to make it hard for people to guess, so they really get into trying to guess really hard. It's a game between the author and the reader. And the answer is, is that if you don't play that game, then what's the point of reading the novel? So after a few of those, and we just wait to the end and watch the show, we recognize that show's not much worth watching. Let's go find better shows. And so we actually increase or improve our mental state, whether you're getting trapped in trying to figure out whodunit, which is actually a game that we play often without the novel. We play the blame game, we play whodunit in our own minds. We're trying to find a villain who has victimized us, because we feel like a victim, we feel like a loser. But every child starts off as a loser, every child starts out completely dependent. And in fact, when that is driven home strongly for the child, they get a very heavy dependency that is called abandonment issue. Okay. They feel like they're going to be abandoned. Well, all of us feel abandoned a little bit because when we were born, we were nurtured. But then about age 4 to 6, Mom had put us to work. Told us to go to school. Mommy abandoned us. She took a job, that kind of thing. And so we all kind of feel abandoned a little bit, and we're always looking for how to fulfill that. That's one of the driving forces for finding a mate, is because we're trying to find and plug that hole that happened when we were kids. And that hole is actually another way, or a conceptual way of looking at that hole, or that loss, or that dependency. Is that we've been in the attitude of a victim. I'm missing something. I need something. And so that whole neediness that happens in childhood is the Samskara that we build up. And so the practice that we're going to perform is to make new Samskara so that when we process newly, we come up with new results. This is why we have to practice it over and over and over again. It's basically like saying that we want to make hamburgers, and the only way we know how to make hamburgers is by throwing hamburgers in the sewer. Well, guess what? If you throw enough hamburgers in that sewer, you're going to have the whole top layer of the sewer as hamburgers, and you don't have to worry about the sewer that's underneath it. You can just deal with a big pile of hamburgers that you've thrown in on top of the pile. So therefore, when you go after into that sewer to get something, the first thing you're going to come up with is a delicious hamburger. Does that make sense? In other words, we have to reprogram it, but we have to actually then cover over our sewer of childhood with a new layer of memory. And so we have to keep adding that layer and adding that layer and adding that layer so that pretty soon it's a good, healthy mix. And then later than that, the whole top layer is nothing but hamburgers.

**Speaker B:** Hamburgers.

**Speaker A:** This is the way of looking at the Samskara, that we're going to be using all of our past in order to perceive this moment. And the better material that we use to help facilitate our perception, then the more likely we're going to have a delicious outcome. Because what we normally do is we see a hamburger and we wind up experiencing sewage. Now we're going to start seeing more and more hamburgers, and this time we're going to start layering the hamburgers of the memory into the top of the sewer so that we have more and more hamburgers. This is how our memory base works. We're going to layer the top of it with good wholesome thoughts and good, wholesome feelings and good, wholesome ways of doing things over and over again so that whatever the moment brings to us, if we can remember, oh, I'm going to get hamburgers, not sewage, out of this memory system. And so this is why I talk about the The way that the mind works is wind up in the feelings. If we have wise feelings, then we can choose what to do with this feeling. But if the feeling is ignorant, in other words, we're getting old past stuff up, then those feelings that arise are going to lead us because of their ignorance into wanting, into needing, and right back down into the same sewer that caused all of the garbage in the first place. But if we are wise at that point of contact, when we can see that, oh, I have a choice about the way that I feel, in the sense of I can like it but I don't want it, or I don't like it but I can put up with it Or another way of saying, uh, which we worked with Alex yesterday, was the idea of I can be satisfied even if I don't get what I want. That's the place to change it. If we can't change it at the point of liking, to just like it and let it go, and it doesn't matter whether I get it or not. Because I don't really want it. But if I do want it, I can still be satisfied with the fact that I'm not going to get what I want. I don't have to keep going after it. That keep going after it is what we call the Upadana, or the trying too hard to get something.

**Speaker C:** What about if you're not satisfied, accepting that you're not satisfied?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a little bit of satisfaction to become satisfied with the fact that you know that you're not satisfied. At least find a little bit of satisfaction in there. Yeah, I don't like it at all, but that's okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I can handle that because I feel like, at least for me, a mind trap would be almost like I wouldn't be satisfied and I would try to tell myself that I was.

**Speaker A:** Ah, yes, but then you can say, oh, I see you, mind trap, too. Let's actually have some real satisfaction. Yeah, I can see those mind traps. I can see myself lying to myself. I can see myself doing those, uh, um, what do they call it, uh, affirmations. Yeah, I'm so good. I'm so gorgeous, you know, I'm the best runner at school. All of those kind of I, me's, and mine's that are in there. Yeah, you want to cling to those ideas rather than— yeah, affirmations are just another pack of lies like politics. Or the fashion industry, just a pack of lies. That in fact clothing is a pack of lies. Why are you guys wearing clothing? Don't you know how expensive it is? I mean, especially look at the people who work really hard and not get very well paid. And how long do your clothes last? When I put on a shirt, I can't put one on that's more than— or that's less than 10 years old. I bought some shirts when I disrobed, and I haven't bought any shirts since then. Don't wear them much. So that's the point.

**Speaker C:** Okay, it could be fun dressing up sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's the point. Well, wait a minute, not necessarily.

**Speaker C:** What if you can appreciate them without attachment to them?

**Speaker A:** Ah, that's another point. But the point is, is that you wear that clothing because you're supposed to. That's just it. All right, it's a rule. You're supposed to wear clothes. But just because I'm supposed to doesn't mean I can't enjoy it. Now that's wisdom. But many people wear clothes and then they have to get more clothes and then they have to go fashion shopping. And I am the clothing. That's the trap that they want you to go down to. Okay. And so congratulations, Ron, you are not your clothing. You're not even the body that wears the clothing. You're just a concept. Descartes. Missed the point. You know Descartes? I think, therefore I am. Yeah, okay, actually he missed the point. A better statement would be, I think, therefore I think I am.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, there's problems. He associated thinking with being.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, exactly. He's missing— he's making the mistake of the distinction between thinking and the being, the self that does the thinking. So, so this is, this is the whole practice of Paticcasamuppada. Hello, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Hi, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Hey guys, good to see you.

**Speaker A:** So Scott's been drilling me on Paticcasamuppada for the past 40 minutes or so. And so to go back for a little review now that we're not talking about causality, let's back up. In fact, one point about causality, and that is, is that when that, you know, the often used example of the domino that falls on the other domino. Right. Well, that's because of a whole lot of conditions. One of the conditions is gravity, that if you kick this domino, it may not in fact go hit that other domino. It may float off into the air. Let us say that it does hit that other domino and then that domino just floats off someplace. No, gravity is a condition that is necessary for one domino to hit another one. Isn't that interesting? Yeah, there's a whole lot of conditionings in there. And so when we recognize that the mind has multiple conditionings and multiple feedback loops— go ahead, Scott, you got a question.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, so I was— that was making me think, like, so the importance about this understanding of causes and conditionings is to understand ultimately that consciousness and perception arise because of certain causes and conditions, and that they can disappear or have a cessation if those causes and conditions go away. And then what's even more important about that is that when consciousness and perception comes back, that suffering is also seen as an aspect within these other phenomena that also has causes and conditions. So you can reprogram the causes and conditions for suffering. So you don't have to— so you can enjoy life.

**Speaker A:** Ah, exactly. And the funny part about it is that we can change the cause and conditions on every particular step of Paticcasamuppada. Okay, that a bar fight, people will eventually wake up in the anger stage before they get into physical contact. And sometimes after the brawl starts, other people will break it up. But if you don't ever break it up, somebody's going to die. Okay, when does it get broken up? Someplace along that stage of Paticcasamuppada, that things will escalate and get worse and get worse and worse until somebody finally wakes up. A really good example of that is, is that the boyfriend and the girlfriend are having a great big fight and argument, and he says something, and then he recognized what a stupid thing he said.

**Speaker B:** I did that.

**Speaker A:** And then he runs to the door, walks out, and slams the door on his way out, right? He wants to break it off. He's recognized he's gone too far. That happens in every argument. We eventually recognize that we've gone too far, we've escalated it too far. That's one of the reasons why psychotherapists know how to over-escalate in a way that puts a stop to the escalation. In other words, you can't just let the client continue to escalate, because that's just going to cause an argument or whatever like that. So that's why the psychologist will do things like take a hike or break it off in some other way. So, uh, it's— Hello?

**Speaker B:** Is he frozen?

**Speaker D:** I think he's frozen.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Are you— is he frozen for you guys too?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Um, what should we do?

**Speaker D:** How's your night going?

**Speaker B:** Oh, mine, uh, good. How about you? How about you?

**Speaker D:** I'm pretty good. No, we just got back from a hike, so that was great.

**Speaker B:** Oh, cool. Nice.

**Speaker D:** What are you guys up to tonight? Oh, we're here on Whidbey Island in Washington State. So it's like this really nice rural island. So there's some trails nearby. So it was just really great. We took our two dogs, my girlfriend and I, and it was just awesome.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Topic: Understanding *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination)**
The central theme is a practical, non-dogmatic exploration of Dependent Origination, moving beyond a rigid, linear "cause-and-effect" model to a more fluid understanding of "mutual conditioning."

### **Main Teachings & Insights:**

1.  **Beyond Simple Causality:** Dependent Origination is not a strict domino-effect chain. Instead, it's a system of **conditional relationships** (like ingredients making lemonade) and **interdependent components** (like the systems of a body forming a functioning whole). Understanding this makes the teaching easier to work with.

2.  **The Five Aggregates & The Self:** The talk connects Dependent Origination to the Five Aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness). The crucial insight is that **there is no permanent, independent "self"** to be found in any of these aggregates. The "self" is a functional concept that arises when these aggregates operate together—like transportation arising from the parts of a car. We mistakenly identify with the body, feelings, or consciousness.

3.  **The Cycle of Suffering (Dukkha):** The standard sequence was outlined: ignorance conditions mental formations → which condition consciousness and perception → leading to contact with sensory experience → which gives rise to feeling → leading to craving and clinging → resulting in becoming and rebirth into states of "neediness" or deprivation (the "woeful states" like anger, fear, or blind conformity).

4.  **Reprogramming the Mind (Samskara):** Our habits and memories (*samskara*) are the stored software that automatically shapes our perceptions and reactions. The path involves **writing new code**—consciously creating new, wholesome mental habits through repeated practice. This is likened to covering a "sewer" of old, unwholesome patterns with a top layer of "hamburgers" (wholesome thoughts and feelings) until the wholesome becomes the default response.

5.  **The Point of Intervention:** The key to freedom is **wise attention at the point of feeling (*vedana*)**. When a feeling arises, wisdom allows us to choose our response: to like something without needing it, or to dislike something without being overwhelmed by aversion. The trap is when ignorant feelings lead automatically to craving and clinging.

6.  **Practical Applications:**
    *   **Language:** Shift from identifying with emotions ("I am angry") to observing them ("There is anger").
    *   **Perspective:** See yourself as the **custodian of the body**, not the body itself. Much societal suffering (consumerism, vanity) stems from the "I am the body" delusion.
    *   **Freedom:** By seeing all phenomena—consciousness, perception, suffering itself—as dependently arisen, we see they can be ceased by changing their conditions. This allows us to "enjoy the show" of life without getting trapped in the "blame game" or endless cycles of reaction.

### **Overall Tone & Method:**
The discussion is informal, conversational, and filled with modern analogies (software, cars, catalytic converters, hamburgers). The emphasis is on **de-mystifying core Buddhist concepts** and making them applicable for understanding and reducing suffering in daily life. The goal is to move from being run by old, conditioned software to mindfully reprogramming one's experience toward happiness and ease.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly **dependent origination (Paticcasamuppada)** and the nature of self. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors for Dependent Origination & Causality**
- **Catalytic Converter Metaphor**  
  Speaker A compares a catalyst in dependent origination to a **catalytic converter** in a car—it triggers reactions in other elements without being consumed itself. This illustrates how some factors condition outcomes without being direct "causes."

- **Lemonade Metaphor**  
  Making lemonade (water + sugar + lemon + ice) is used to explain **conditionality**—all ingredients are necessary, but none alone causes lemonade. Similarly, mental states arise from multiple conditions, not single causes.

- **Domino Effect (as a *misleading* metaphor)**  
  The domino effect is mentioned as an oversimplification of causality—it implies direct, linear cause-and-effect, whereas reality involves complex, interdependent conditions (like gravity, surface friction, etc.).

- **Hamburgers and Sewer Metaphor**  
  Speaker A describes reprogramming the mind (**samskara**, or mental habits) by "layering hamburgers over a sewer." Old negative patterns (sewage) are covered with new positive mental habits (hamburgers) through repeated practice, until the mind retrieves "hamburgers" instead of "sewage."

- **Software Upgrade Metaphor**  
  The mind’s habitual patterns are compared to **old software subroutines**. Buddhist practice is like **writing new code** or installing a "software upgrade" to change how the mind operates.

---

### **2. Metaphors for the Self and the Aggregates**
- **Car/Chariot Metaphor**  
  Referencing the Buddhist parable of Nagasena and the chariot, Speaker A explains that a **car** (or chariot) is a functional assembly of parts—wheels, engine, etc. Similarly, the "self" is a temporary functioning of the **Five Aggregates** (body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, consciousness), with no permanent essence.

- **Camera Metaphor**  
  The **mind/consciousness** is compared to a camera that can’t take a picture of itself—just as the mind cannot directly perceive the brain or its own origin. This illustrates the limitations of self-awareness.

- **Clock Ticking Metaphor**  
  Consciousness is like the **ticking of a clock**—it’s a function unaware of the clock’s machinery. Similarly, we mistake mental phenomena for a solid "self."

---

### **3. Metaphors for Mental States & Suffering**
- **Murder Mystery Metaphor**  
  Life is compared to reading a **murder mystery**—if you try too hard to "solve" it (control outcomes, blame others), you suffer. Instead, you can "enjoy the show" without attachment to the result.

- **Bar Fight / Relationship Argument Story**  
  Speaker A describes an escalating argument as an example of **dependent origination in action**—each step (anger, speech, action) conditions the next, until someone "wakes up" and breaks the cycle.

- **Stage Fright Example**  
  The anxiety of a child in a school play ("I am a tree") is used to illustrate one of the **"woeful states"** (asuras)—a state of fear and agitation based on self-identification.

---

### **4. Metaphors for Perception & Reality**
- **Clothing and Fashion Industry Metaphor**  
  Speaker A critiques the **"I am the body" delusion** by pointing to the fashion industry—clothing as a "pack of lies" we buy into, mistaking appearance for identity. Wisdom is wearing clothes without attachment, not identifying with them.

- **Ice Melting Example**  
  Speaker B uses **ice melting** to explain conditionality—multiple conditions (temperature, pressure) must align for the effect to occur, similar to mental phenomena.

---

### **5. Metaphors for Impermanence & Non-Attachment**
- **YouTube Video Metaphor**  
  Speaker B jokes that worrying about what you say on a recorded video is pointless because **every viewer (and you) will die**—the video, like all phenomena, is impermanent and will be forgotten. This underscores non-attachment to a "permanent record."

- **Avocado Story**  
  The casual exchange about avocados in Thailand vs. Mexico (and organized crime) subtly introduces **interdependence**—how economics, geography, and social conditions affect simple things like food cost and taste.

---

### **Key Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors:**
- **Dependent origination** as a web of conditions, not linear causality.
- **Non-self (anatta)** as a functional assembly, not a fixed entity.
- **Reprogramming the mind** through mindful practice.
- **Impermanence and non-attachment** as keys to reducing suffering.
- The **danger of identification** with body, feelings, thoughts, or social roles.

These metaphors make abstract Buddhist teachings relatable and practical, emphasizing that understanding the mind’s mechanics can lead to freedom from suffering.
