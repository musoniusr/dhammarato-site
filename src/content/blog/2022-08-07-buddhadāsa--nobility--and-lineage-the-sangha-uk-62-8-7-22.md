### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, uh, welcome to Sunday, uh, Dhamma chats with the Sangha. I'm glad to see all of you here. It's getting to be a regular kind of group. I like that a lot.

**Speaker B:** I like it too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that you know each other and you're beginning to find friends. And when you smile and nod, you know that smiling and nodding is rubbing off, and somebody else will start to smile and nod. And so Marcus is interviewing for a job at a wat right outside of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. And we already know that there's a kind of a famous important wat there that's famous and important not only for the very, very ancient architecture, but also for the fact that they're really into Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Okay, and so that wat— I forgot the name of it, sorry— Wat Umong. Umong, okay. They do retreats and all kinds of things like that. And that the likelihood of temple abbots knowing about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is kind of profound in the sense that it, I believe, in fact it seems logical to say that it's hard to become an abbot at a wat without also becoming noble in that 20 years. But it can be done, and this is the test. This is the easy test, because if he drops the name Bhikkhu Buddhadasa on an Abbot in a remote wad in Thailand, he can get the immediate reaction of, 'Oh, I don't know,' or, 'Oh, I don't want to talk about it,' or, 'I'll see you later.' Or, hey friend. Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker B:** One question though, because the Thai people, sometimes they don't know the name Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. They know him as like Indrapasso or something like that. I can't remember now.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's another point that we have to straighten out. I've actually been slapped with that one before, that it took them 20 minutes to figure out who he was talking about. Yeah, because the Thai name is Tanha, Chan, Puttatat, Bhikkhu. Tanha, Chan, Puttatat, Bhikkhu. So the Tanha, Chan, actually the Tan is very much like the word 'oo' in Burmese, and it has to do with generally uncle. And we would go around calling each other Tan all the time, have to watch. But Tanha-Chan put together means that he's the great big friendly sort of uncle who happens to be named Puttatat. In the Pali, being squished by the Thai tongue, the B becomes a P, Uh, the D's become a T and the tail end is left off, right? Yeah, after it was cremated, from a T to an S. Okay, so Buddhadasa or Puttatata, but the ta is left off at the end, so it just winds up being Puttatat Bhikkhu. Gosh, I've said it enough. I hope everybody remembers that if they're around a Taiwán.

**Speaker B:** It makes sense to me. I, I didn't, I didn't really know that actually, so thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And often he will respond back with just merely the Tan or the Tanha Chan. That's the familiarity that people feel with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that form actually is very infrequently used because the most often way would be the Puttatat because it's most often used in Thailand. That Bhikkhuni Buddhadasa hasn't really caught on in the West. We'll do something about that now, won't we?

**Speaker B:** What about the title Luang Por? Like, I think it's like It's basically dad, kind of like, you know, Luang Phor is like one used for many monks in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Luang Phor is actually Uncle Daddy. Pa, and many Wat abbots are named Luang Phor. But in fact, Ajahn Po slapped his face one time when he asked me, well, who was the name of the abbot what Washington, DC, where you stay? And my answer was Luang Prabang. And he says, the last I heard, Luang Prabang Sarawak is still alive. And that's probably 10-year-old information, but I mean, he was already so old he was mummified when I did see him. And he sort of sat there behind the— in the small room behind, you know, the kind of dais where you keep plastic Jesuses or giant Buddha statues and things like that. And so he stayed in a little room behind there. And that was, I think, like 2003. A whole bunch of us monks went up to Washington, D.C. To sort of hang out. And that's where we met. In fact, that's where I personally met Achan Tiwan, who— he's the acting abbot. Achan Po Luangpo Sherlock is still the abbot, but he's so old that he doesn't do anything anymore. And that happens a lot. And then in fact, that's exactly the right way for it to happen, because as he gets older, other people take on the duties. And that right now at Wat Soan Mokkh, they have 3 monks that are sharing the duties, and one of them will probably will probably be the one who is elected as the abbot after Ajaan Po dies, and that's not happening anytime soon. He's only 93. And so, it really is in a way, the most noble kind of an old boys club that you can imagine. And they do get around. And at the top level of the nobles and the old monks, generally they know about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. But that doesn't mean that if they don't know, that they're not noble. But in fact, that's how I found out about it, was running into it in the Lao community when I kind of was invited to take a road trip that wound us up in the the Wat Denver, the big Wat in Laos, and the abbot there was the number 2 monk in the United States. And then later, I got to go visit the number 1, who is Ajahn Boonmee, at Washington, D.C., of all things. They've got a Wat Lao Washington, it's right outside of town, but it is huge piece of property. He had so many monks, or Lao monks, stay in and out in that place. So anyway, back to the Denver story. The monk there was the brother of another monk and also the uncle of another monk. Those two guys were brothers, and that this guy, the young one, was this the son of the third brother who was not a monk. Okay, so you see all three generations except that this one's the son, and he was my friend, and he was born and raised in Amarillo, Texas, in the Lao community there. And he spoke English mostly, but he knew a bit of Lao. But I became his student teaching him the Dharma in English, not knowing that he now goes and rants to his uncle about the stuff that I'm telling them or telling him, and they get blown away. And so I get invited to go to, uh, to Denver to find out that it's also the Lao are noble also. And there's kind of the right kind of questions to ask and things like this, where you get it. And I was kind of surprised, because I was still under the illusion at that time that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was unique, to where in fact he was not unique at all. That he had a teacher, and his teacher's teacher is famous enough. He was the one who reformed Thai Buddhism around the times of the early 19th century, and then he disrobed to become the regent while Chulalongkorn's son became of age and then took over the throne in 1920 or something like that. And this monk was then the Patriarch, and he gave that to this other monk whose name Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Jhana, who then in the 1930s became Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's teacher. And so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has quite a royal lineage back with, I mean, his number one teacher, is Somdet Sangharaj, the patriarch of Thailand from like 1920 to 1950 when he died. And there's, uh, at Wat Tat in Bangkok, there is a huge number of manuscript handwritten documents between the two of them, back and forth, because Bhikkhu Buddhadasa stayed in southern Thailand and, uh, his teacher actually visited him one time, and that was hard doings back then. In the 1930s, probably the only way he could get there easily would be by boat, because Chaya was a port, but there were no good roads. There was certainly a whole lot of foot traffic, but I do not expect an elderly patriarch to go all the way by foot to Wat Soan Mokkh. Because it's what, 600-700 kilometers, something like that. But he did go to visit, and within 2 hours, they decided that it would be beneficial for Bhikkhu Buddhadasa to become the Patriarch's student. I really like that story. The reason is because it makes Bhikkhu Buddhadasa ordinary, and that what he has is attainable, but it has to be passed down in the lineage. That's why I'm so glad to make friends with you guys. I've got something that I've got to share with you. It comes through the lineage. That's how old, we don't know. But we do know that it's been associated with the royal family of Thailand for 100 years or more. In fact, Achan Muecha was born in 1860, and he was the younger brother to the Longhorn, and the king was King Mongkut. And the whole story there is in The King and I, the movie, which the Thai people love, except they don't like Yul Brynner as the king because the King Mongkut was nothing like the authoritarian SOB that was in the movie, because they needed a big transition at the end of the movie, I suppose. But it was very clear within Thai history that King Mongkut also was noble. And there's a lot of people in the West that kind of think that becoming enlightened is rare. That no one's been enlightened for hundreds of years, those kind of things. Or that we've lost the practice, we've lost the friendship, or we've lost the techniques. And that it's just history. And that there's even a whole group of Buddhists that are in the intention of, "Oh, we've got to regather. I mean, we should have all the evidence that we can to put it back together, that which has been lost. They don't recognize that it hasn't been lost. It just hasn't been transmitted to Western Buddhism very well. But when we have a group of people who are beginning to understand the teachings of the Buddha, they can help each other and start to build a Sangha right here on the Internet. That the Buddha was not against technology at all. So we can use this technology, that's easy and freely available, to share that noble friendship that is part and parcel of this old boys club that is so profound. Because it's so full of nobles. And it takes one to know one.

**Speaker C:** I got a question, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go right ahead.

**Speaker C:** Sorry. I recently went to like one of the monasteries around London, Citta Vecchia or something like that, like by Ajahn Chah, was established I guess. I went there and I was like very— surprised how closed off it felt. It did feel— I could see that there's noble teachings there, but it did not feel like very welcoming to strangers, at least during daytime. There's like a whole—.

**Speaker A:** Sure, let me ask.

**Speaker C:** I felt like— Let me— Do you.

**Speaker A:** Do you, uh, were you there long enough to know, uh, at least a few of the monks? Enough to know whether they were Asian or whether they were Western?

**Speaker C:** I've only seen Western monks there and it did— I didn't get to talk to any of them because there was like a structure to the system. You can only talk to them after 5 o'clock and it felt really weird because I got there in the morning and the whole day is like scheduled into like gaps and you can only talk to them during the evening.

**Speaker A:** How Christian of them. I know at Wat Suan Mokkh or any of the other wats that I've stayed where there was a schedule, that this is all part of that Western mentality. This is Western Buddhism. You in fact gave it away when you said Achan Chah. That's why I asked what was the mix. If these had been all Thai monks, then I would have been surprised. But since you said they were all Western, I said, "Yeah, I know all, been there, done that.".

**Speaker C:** But I did find like the practices is still like noble. There were like books and stuff like that they're studying, which is noble. I'm not sure if they're understanding the teachings. You will never know.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps you should know this, maybe you don't, but Achan Chah was most specifically a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, even though he lived in the Northeast, in Udon Ratchasima, and had Wat Phra Bong, and then eventually Wat Pañña Cha. The times. In fact, the only time that I have spent time with Achan Chah was at Wat Soan Mokkh. And I spent quite a lot of time with Achan Samadhi also, kind of because they each one individually went to see Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and while they weren't, they were with me. And so I've spent quite a lot of time with Achan Chah and Achan Samadhi, and then later spent about 6 weeks in Himmelhangstad at Amaravati.

**Speaker D:** I was there recently.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I might be going to Amaravati next Friday for a while to stay there. I'm not sure what— I really didn't even look into it so much, but it seemed very interesting.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's— I would say that's surprising that that's your experience at Citta Viveka, and it might just be because you were there for a day visit. I stayed a week at Amaravati, and Amaravati is a big place with a lot of monks and nuns.

**Speaker A:** And even there, I think there they should have a mix of Thai also. Yes, Ajahn Chah is well known. Yeah, and the important point that I want to make is, is that because Achan Chah was also a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that meant that Achan Chah was within that noble group anyway. That, that's the way you kind of understand it, because there was a wide number of very senior monks throughout Thailand who considered Bhikkhuni their their teacher and their elder brother. He was that high of a status, and the only reason why that was true was because he opened the bag and let the cat out, the Thai people in general. And in fact, that's what happened. He got in trouble for doing that in the 1930s, and the trouble that he got into was severe, in the sense of, Someone, uh, in a public talk that they heard of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was so, um, let us say upset about what he was saying that they made a big deal of it, got a lot of friends. I mean, they didn't have, uh, TikTok or, uh, Twitter back then, but they certainly knew how to talk, and they got a whole bunch of people against Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Because what they were accusing him of was a Sangha decessa. Now, a Sangha decessa actually has a particular point to it that these lay people didn't understand. And that particular point of a Sangha decessa is that it's when you are using malicious gossip, when Bhikkhu A is talking to Bhikkhu B about the problems with Bhikkhu C, in order to get Bhikkhu B to side with you against Bhikkhu C. That's the Sangha de Sesa, and it's based upon malicious gossip. And so that's why both of those are in the Pātimokkha. So it was basically an issue of them not understanding that in fact the teachings of the Buddha is in layers. This guy just didn't like it and made a big deal out of it, and so they wound up— because this was in Bangkok, because Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was in Pali studies, there standing and arguing with the teachers about what the definitions of words meant when this Sangha Dassesa happened. And so, because of the interest and all the kerfuffle it wound up having, most of the Sangha Dassesa was made up of very senior monks, mostly the abbots of all of the temples around the royal area of Bangkok. Including the ones I know. I'm not sure about who was on the council, but Wat Bhavana, Wat Mahathat, Wat Phra Arahant, Wat Arun, Wat Atthit, Wat Siddhet— I mean, they've got enough just royal wats around that area to come up with 20. And the Sangha, Samadhi Sangharaj at the time, Achan Bhikkhu Bhuddhasatthajananda that I just mentioned before, he was on that council of 20 that tried Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa defended himself with the Pali, and that caused quite a kerfuffle at all of these places, because this was the most scholarly, uptight group of monks in Bangkok, and literally in the world. And so they went through a major scurry through the Pali to back up everything or to deny everything that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had to say. And he came out like a shiny penny because of this literature search, and they had to put away a lot of their points. So as always with the compromise The Sangha dissesa ended with that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is teaching the right thing to the wrong people, which means letting the cat out of the bag so that everybody could see what's going on. And he continued with that, because he'd already been tried and proven guilty of it, and so he became guilty of that big time. With all the public talks and everything that he gave, and Wat Soen Mook was already mostly forest, and so they built— I think at its height there was like 400 monks staying there, and that would have been— half of them would have been there all the time, full-time, and the others were there for pancha, for about 4 months of the year. So including the abbots that were already in the old boys' club, and they flocked to him. And so, very famous monks like Ajahn Pañña�����ha, who was the Chao Wat, which means the abbot, of Wat Chulabhaton in Nortebury, north of Bangkok. And it was known at the time to be the largest wat in the world, because of the number of monks there: 3,000! Can you imagine 3,000 monks in one monastery? They were going out for pindapat. You know where they went to pindapat? They went to the slums, which was right across the road at the time. And so, they fanned out and they'd go around, because this is a very deeply, heavily populated area. One of the things that happened was, these monks were given so much food that they collected it by great big buckets full, every day, and took it to the school. After a while, this became kind of the ritual, so that when they— we don't know what your child's going to eat today, but because you're contributing to the monks of 3,000, all the schools in this neighborhood are going to get to feed their kids too. And that's the kind of thing that happens in Thailand around these kind of noble monks that can set stuff up like that. And so, Ajahn Pañña Nanda was a very famous, high-quality monk that was a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, so that's where Sankhara was sent for ordination. And so, he spent quite a lot of time at Wat Chulapatthan. And so he got really deeply into the Thai community in Bangkok. I mean, he was a shining Anagami, knew Thai better than anybody that we know of, as well as a Western monk. And so he fit right into that Thai community in Bangkok very, very well. And that's where he spent most of his time after he became a full Arhat, after his 10 years. So that's an interesting side point. And now, in Bangkok, there's a huge facility that actually can be seen by Google Maps, by going to Chatuchak Park. There's a big park in northern Bangkok, and just above that is a huge piece of property that is Wat Suwan Moo, Bangkok. It's so big that they've got room for a lake, that's how big it is. And people like to walk around the lake. It's a very interesting facility, and they're keeping the archives of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, because he was very prolific, not necessarily in writing so much, but in speaking and in having it recorded. And so they were keeping a big library of cassettes, and I think that they've been going through a process of digitizing all of that stuff. The problem is not the speed of the digitizing. The problem is that you have to run those cassettes through a cassette machine and record. And so it's a long, slow process. They've got so many, um, and then it's all in Thai. Getting it from, uh, the tape to the, uh, to, um The digital is just one step. Now you've got to go through maybe with some AI and get it translated into— that's something that would be an interesting project, is get AI to listen to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's voice and translate it first into Thai and then into English. That would be a problem. I hadn't even thought about that. That would be a really good project, do it all with computers. Got any volunteers here? Yeah, you can go stay in Bangkok at around the nobles at Vajrayana.

**Speaker D:** Well, you're— if you get a computer to do it, then you're robbing someone of the chance to get enlightened while transcribing it all.

**Speaker A:** Uh, based upon the experience from the past, that's a no-go anyway. I mean, look how bad the translations are because they have the attitude of the translator. So maybe we can tweak the AI into giving a really noble translation. So Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that right now the translations that we have are mostly done by guys who were scholars in the first place, laboriously learned the Thai language, and now are taking the very simple, down-to-earth, dirt language of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and translated into really, really high-class, hard-to-understand English in the style of the suttas. Because that's exactly what happened with the suttas. That they were absolutely dirt-class ordinary Pali in the time of the Buddha, and they've been mistranslated. Don't get me started on my long list of words that are so poorly translated, wind up not understanding the sutras at all. Words like Nibbana and awakened, and, um, enlightenment is another, whatever that is. The Jhanas, monk, nun, and in fact, someone just mentioned about the Achancha having a schedule. That's what monks and nuns do. They see themselves as monks and nuns, not Bhikkhus, who are too free. Bhikkhu's not going to bother to go to something because they were invited to go do it. Not unless they're in charge of the place. That, in fact, is one of the qualities of the Buddha. The only invitation that the Buddha ever accepted was when he was the one in charge. He was the big dude. No matter what it was, that he got the royal table or wasn't there. This is actually in the Suttas. Wherever he went in public, he was— I mean, all the attention of room just goes to him. He was the star. But those kinds of people are not so rare. That was true of Bhikkhu Buddhadasi. Everywhere he went, he was the star of the show. And so monks showing up because they're supposed to show up, and they're all showing up because they're supposed to show up— who's in charge there? Somebody who made the rules, I suppose. Goes. But a real lion's not going to go, says, because he was told to go. That's, by the way, part of that, uh, it takes one to know one kind of thing. The nobles are noble, and they know what nobility is, because they've been kind of playing with it and working on it for so many years already. And so, it takes one to know one. And that answers all of the questions about what happened in the Second Council at Ridesbury. What happened was, is that the Buddhism became known by King Ashoka, who was already close to it anyway. I mean, his great-great-grandfather or something was King Bimbisara, a fellow of the Buddha. But he got it big time. And not only that, but he did it kind of with— and by the time he had conquered most of India, and then he put up all of these edicts all over India, and then sutras were gathered later by his son from all over India, because Buddhism had kind of spread all over the place. And so this was all gathered together so that they could take it to Sri Lanka. And Sri Lanka became kind of the library of Buddhism because all of it was snatched by the king during the time of King Ashoka. And so, uh, they were left with all of these pillars and everything and other copies. Uh, Nalanda, by the way, but much, many centuries later was when the entire library that they had at the time was destroyed. But the point is, is that Buddhism became very popular in the time of Asoka. He gave free monasteries, free food, free robes, anything; and so, all of the people from all of the other religions, especially Brahmanism, flocked and became monks. Student monks, too many for the original cadre of nobles to handle. It's sort of, kind of like, imagine that a university that could handle 10,000 students, with a faculty of say, 1,000, all of a sudden grows by 10 times, and now you've got 100,000 students and you still only have a faculty of 1,000. And facilities for 1,000, except that facilities were added by the king, but not the education itself. This is what caused a schism in Buddhism that wound up with the Theravada and the Mahayana. But that schism didn't really cause the loss of nobility, that nobility continued within each of the groups. And so that's why we can understand that the Dalai Lama, the guy who is in charge of the monks kind of in one group of the Tibetans, is a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. We've got a little film someplace on our channel that shows that they were there. Okay, so that kind of proves that at that time of the schism that happened in It went kind of like this: that the students had to educate themselves, because there wasn't any noble teachers to go around. And so, a conference was called. Unfortunately, the conference was called in the capital, because the king was going to support the conference, instead of having it out in the woods where they should have had it; they kept it on the QT. It was a big whoop-de-doo in town. And they only let in the nobles. And the question is, what questions did they ask, or how do they know? The answer is it takes one to know one, and that's easy enough to figure out. And a lot of them didn't get in, and so they got uptight and they went off and had their own Maha Sangha, they called it. They had their own council. And that was the beginning of Mahayana. And this happened in 300 BC. And that split kind of stayed there. But at the local level of the monks who lived together, that was only politics. Still, the issue was, are you going to learn the noble teachings of the Buddha? And so those things kind of grew apart like that. I think that that's kind of interesting history. To understand why Buddhism actually has become a religion, is because too many monks were let in, all of a sudden, in that kind of classical sense. And so, the other side is to see, why did it stay so small? Why were there so few nobles? And so few non-nobles? The answer to that came from the point of— they got to the point of saying, when the student asks the right question at the right time to the right teacher, then he's given the right answers. But that only happens occasionally. Someone already has to hunger and thirst after the Dhamma to be able to to find the kind of teacher. And so it kind of was rare. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa blew the lid off of that. It needs a lot of thirst. A lot of what? Thirst, hunger. Well, that is what makes a Sotapanna. That's another way of raising it is when you hunger and thirst after the Dharma to the point that that's the only thing that you care about. That's when you're in the stream. Why are you in the stream? You're just drinking all the water there.

**Speaker D:** Is.

**Speaker A:** Taking it in. So, uh, a lot of people think that becoming Srotapanna is a becoming based upon an experience. But you nailed it, it's the hunger and thirst after the Dhamma, want to see the Dhamma in everything. And then not only are you hungry or thirsty, but you've gotten your fill, and so the eager turns into delight. And I'm tracing down— these are, by the way, in Sutta number 48 in the Seven Knowledges. But that hunger and thirst for the Dharma is definitely there. I think that's the one that starts at step 5. And so this is the process of one becoming noble, is that they have to have that hunger and thirst even if the actual teachings are widespread. But that hunger and thirst is there even though the people are only getting magical answers to 2 important questions. But if they keep hungering and thirsting and they're around the right guys, then they're going to get in. They're going to get into that old boys club. However, if you're in a society like Thailand is currently now, when you have that hunger and thirst and there happens to be guys out hawking for— here's the Dhamma guys, the way that it has been with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. That's why he's caught on so much. Now, here's another point about it, is that Bhikkhuni Buddhadasa by name is not worshiped. And since he's been dead for 30 years, the younger type people have never heard of him. It's only the older guys that know about him because he died in 1993. Many of you were not even born then. And so this is why, uh, you know, um, we, we want— we wind up worshiping the dead when in fact he left a living lineage. But we still in that lineage want to pay homage to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa because he's the one that opened the doors to this thing. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Dhammakaya, like the body.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, yeah, the whole Dhammakaya, the whole body of knowledge that in fact the universe, or, um, uh, let us say God's creation in the Pali would be Dhammakaya. It's the whole show. And is open. In fact, there's a joke about it, and that is the young magical-thinking dude flew all the way from the US to the Himalayas and then climbed up because he had heard that there's this old monk way up high in the hills that knows all about it. And so he hungered and he thirsted and he crawled and he begged and he got his way up there, and he says 'Oh mighty Guru, please tell me one thing I have to know, and that is, what is the key to the universe? What is the Dhammakaya? What's the key to the universe?' And the old monk answered, and he says, 'I don't know.' And then he said, 'The universe has been left unlocked.' The key to the universe is that it's been left unlocked. It's available to everybody. All you have to do is walk right in, make the effort, get up off your broken ass, your bad attitude, and walk right in. To the reality of the moment. Here it is. It's been unlocked and we didn't know.

**Speaker D:** I have a question on this actually. After staying at Amaravati and after staying on a retreat recently, I've kind of gotten fed up I mean, in some sense I'm glad that I read about Srotapanna and Anagamis and Arahants and all that sort of stuff, because it, you know, it got my mind interested, you know, it got that kind of craving going and got my butt on the cushion. But after my butt's been on the cushion for a while and my mind's been a bit, you know, more tamed over the past year I just noticed that this is just getting in the way of me being in the moment. And so now, you know, I was trying to practice on these retreats and these thoughts would keep coming up of getting somewhere, trying to go somewhere, going.

**Speaker A:** Someplace, setting a goal, getting something, getting a list of things to lay them down as planks in the mind that you've got to crawl over.

**Speaker D:** It's just like in some sense, it's like, you know, obviously if you want to take a nice walk in the park, you got to like go to the park. But once you're there, you can't, you can't think about the park like you're there. Like, just, just enjoy the, you know.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? It is hard to not think about the park when you're in the park. But humans are good at doing that. Dogs are not very good at it. When they're in the park, they know they're in the park. Humans can go to the park and they don't have a clue.

**Speaker D:** Like kind of this thing that people say of, you know, if you're in the forest and you're walking, obviously the aim is to kind of get out the forest, but the objective is to watch each step, right?

**Speaker A:** We wouldn't be here if— Enjoy the moment while you're in the forest.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. And we wouldn't be here if we didn't care about getting our minds out of the muck in some sense.

**Speaker A:** But the next part of that though is to take the easy way out. And this is the part that most people don't understand, is just take every step but take the easy way out, which in the— when you're lost in the forest means go downhill. If you keep going downhill, you run across the creek and then you just follow it downhill, and pretty soon you're going to meet somebody, have a simple debate somewhere. So take the easy way out.

**Speaker D:** And this is my kind of question now, which is— I mean, it's not even a question, it's just like.

**Speaker B:** First.

**Speaker D:** Is, why does practice kind of always seem to go like, you know, a few months ago I could sit for like more than an hour, and now like my mind's just like, I can't even focus for a few seconds. Like, why does it seem to vary?

**Speaker A:** Because when you were sitting there for an hour, you were figuring out that you couldn't focus for a few seconds. You were ignoring what was going on. Now you're beginning to see what's going on. Congratulations.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, okay. Um, and then the other one is.

**Speaker A:** Look at what the mind is doing. It's quite a jungle in there, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's— yeah, it is a jungle. I thought I got through the first jungle, and then there's another jungle now.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, another word for jungle would be tangled.

**Speaker D:** Tangled here.

**Speaker A:** A thicket of views is what the Buddha refers to it, a thicket. So we could use that word thicket as a jungle because we keep getting scratched on our own thoughts.

**Speaker D:** What did Bhikkhu Buddhadasa say about like—.

**Speaker A:** Well, many things. One of the things he said was Uh, because I asked him, yeah, in English there's a phrase, at first you don't succeed, try, try again, which is what you're doing. And he— and I said that to him and he really laughed and he says, no, if at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing. And now you're beginning to look at what you're doing. And so that's what the whole 8-fold noble path is about, is remember to look at what you're doing, and then take the effort to straighten it out.

**Speaker D:** Which is usually just drop it because this is a useless thought and I don't know how it crept in, and.

**Speaker A:** Try and watch for the next one. Just throw it out. That's an easy way to deal with it, is just throw it out. But you have to see that that's the thought. That's why I said look at what you're doing, and when you see that that's the kind of thought you had, yeah, Go it out. Be here now.

**Speaker B:** I like how Tanestra said the breath is there first, you know. The breath was there before all this nonsense came up in the mind. It's still there.

**Speaker A:** It is so important to add the breathing to this because the breathing has many benefits, including to help us remember to be here now. With each breath. That's why the Buddha talks about Sati, to watch, to make sure that this breath isn't a long in-breath, and to watch and make sure that this breath is a long out-breath. And that generally we make the long out-breath and then the holding of the long out-breath longer than the in-breath. So there's many different ways that we can get started on that. We can talk about breathing techniques right now, but I'd rather just play around with other stuff. Other than to say that play with your breath, experience it, recognize how your body chemistry changes by changing your breathing patterns, look at where the tensions are, and relax. These are the first 4 steps of Anapanasati.

**Speaker D:** So this is the other question I have, that I'm assuming you don't want to have an overly long breath for too long, because then like, like kind of forcing it— Well, then it's not—.

**Speaker A:** If it's overly anything, it's too much. Yes, we're looking for balance. Sure. Find out what your balance is, play with that. Get really comfortable so that you can relax. So, there's no rules in there, other than Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, come to the relaxation. Remember my story about getting lost in the forest, in the woods? You take the easy way out, just keep going downhill. Watch where you're going, go downhill, and you'll find your way out. But we've been taught in our society to climb, climb every mountain, ford every sea. Follow your heart. Soon you'll find a rainbow with a pot of gold at the end to it. I mean, this is the whole story. Climb every mountain. Sure, right.

**Speaker B:** I love how all these stories and analogies come together. So, um, going downhill is so easy because gravity is helping you anyway. Gravity is helping every every step. And naturally, that's where water would be, so that's where life would flourish. But also, just reminds me of so many other similes, like the stream and grasping at straws. And why grasp at these views when you can just like relax and enjoy it?

**Speaker A:** Just go with the flow and drink your fill.

**Speaker B:** I like that one about drinking the stream you're into. It's quite funny.

**Speaker A:** You can thank Vedana for that one. That's his idea. Thirsty. That's what we are. We're thirsty. And all we have to do is just drink and jump in the stream of life and drink our fill. Nothing new. Nothing new. Nothing new. Yeah, this is old. Buddha's been around for 2,500 years, and he even said that he just rediscovered an old path. There's nothing much to it except that you meet a lot of good friends along the way to nowhere.

**Speaker E:** Or you must be like— you must become children to enter the kingdom of heaven kind of thing.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, exactly so. And I tell you, the age precisely so, and that's the age of 3. We have to go back and become 3-year-olds again, where everything is interesting, everything is exciting, and we are able to do anything and go anywhere and get our way every time. That's the age of 3, it's the marvelous age. And we also are getting all the nourishment from Mommy that she can handle. By the time you're 4, when she's had another baby, and now you're Anagami, Anapanasati, Anicca, and your whole world falls apart again. So yeah, it's funny, you must become a 3-year-old child again in order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, which is just right here. Here it is.

**Speaker C:** I was just observing— sorry, I was observing a family like walking by, and you can see that like a kid behind them is interested in everything surrounding, like the scooters in the city, the tiles, and the mom is just like, "Come on, we gotta go be somewhere, we gotta go, we gotta go," and the kid is just like enjoying himself. You have like plenty of examples of that, like pure Anicca.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. There it is, that's the Dhamma. He's enjoying the Dhamma and she is going someplace. Doing something, climbing the mountain called Sotapanna or something like that. To where the real quality of Sotapanna is being thirsty enough to jump in. Well guys, this has been a really good conversation. I've enjoyed this one. Real tearjerker for a while. I love it. Me too. Does anybody have anything to say on the way out?

**Speaker D:** Stay present.

**Speaker E:** Watch your step.

**Speaker A:** Have the best way out you can. Yeah, go. Yeah, take off downhill. Take the easy way out. We'll see you guys next time. Wow, this has been great. I've really enjoyed this. Great, great, great. See ya. Thanks, everybody. Thank you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, is a wide-ranging, informal discussion that weaves together personal stories, historical context, and core meditation advice. Here is a summary of the key themes and points:

### **Core Themes:**
1.  **The "Old Boys' Club" of Nobles:** A central idea is that genuine understanding (nobility, or being a *Sotāpanna* and beyond) has been preserved in an unbroken, informal lineage within Thai Buddhism, particularly among monks connected to **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**. This isn't about institutions but about direct transmission from teacher to student ("it takes one to know one").
2.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Role:** He is presented as the pivotal figure who "opened the bag" and made the profound Dhamma accessible to the public and to many influential Thai monks (like Ajahn Chah), moving it beyond scholarly circles.
3.  **Critique of Institutional/Western Buddhism:** The talk contrasts the free, inquisitive spirit of the "noble" path with the structured, scheduled, and sometimes closed feeling of some Western monastic settings (using a visit to an Ajahn Chah monastery as an example).
4.  **The Simplicity of Practice:** The ultimate advice is to stop striving for complex goals and simply **"look at what you're doing"** in the present moment. The path is about relaxation, ease, and drinking from the stream of Dhamma that is already available.

### **Key Discussion Points:**

*   **Historical & Lineage Context:**
    *   Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was part of a noble lineage tracing back to Thai patriarchs.
    *   He faced early criticism (a *Sanghādisesa* charge) for teaching profound truths to laypeople but was vindicated.
    *   The schism between Theravada and Mahayana is simplistically explained as a result of rapid growth after King Ashoka, diluting the teacher-student ratio, not a loss of the noble essence.

*   **The Path and Attitude:**
    *   **Entry Point:** Becoming a *Sotāpanna* ("stream enterer") is framed not as a mystical experience but as developing a **"hunger and thirst" for the Dhamma**.
    *   **Core Instruction:** When stuck, don't just "try, try again." Instead, **"look at what you're doing"** and adjust. Drop useless thoughts.
    *   **The "Easy Way Out":** Use the metaphor of being lost in a forest: stop climbing mountains; just **go downhill** (the path of least resistance, relaxation, and ease). Follow the breath, which is always present.
    *   **Childlike Mind:** To access the "kingdom of heaven" (enlightenment/Nibbāna), regain the curious, present-centered, and delighted mind of a three-year-old child.

*   **Practical Meditation Advice:**
    *   Use **ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) as an anchor to be here now.
    *   **Play with the breath** to find balance and relaxation; observe how it affects body and mind.
    *   The goal is not to force anything but to **observe and relax** tensions.

*   **Anecdotes & Tangents:**
    *   The correct Thai pronunciation of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's name (Tan Ajahn Puttatat).
    *   Stories about large Thai monasteries and their social roles.
    *   The challenge of translating Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's vast archive of talks.
    *   A joke about the "key to the universe" being that it's "unlocked"—already accessible.

### **Overall Tone & Message:**
The talk is conversational, humorous, and digressive, embodying the friendly "Sangha" environment it promotes. The ultimate takeaway is **demystification**: the noble path isn't lost, rare, or overly complex. It's about cultivating a sincere thirst for truth, finding noble friends, and simplifying your practice down to mindful, relaxed presence—taking the easy way out by going with the flow of Dhamma already here.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and the transmission of teachings. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Old boys' club"** – Used to describe the informal, interconnected network of senior, enlightened ("noble") monks in Thailand who recognize and transmit the true teachings.
2.  **"Letting the cat out of the bag"** – Describes Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's act of making advanced or "secret" teachings available to the general public, not just monastics.
3.  **"Takes one to know one"** – Repeated to explain how enlightened individuals (nobles) recognize each other, such as in the story of the council that tried Buddhadasa.
4.  **"Jump in the stream and drink your fill" / "Hunger and thirst for the Dhamma"** – A metaphor for becoming a *Sotāpanna* (stream-enterer), characterized by a deep, consuming desire to understand and embody the teachings.
5.  **"The key to the universe is that it's been left unlocked"** – A joke/metaphor illustrating that enlightenment or understanding reality is always accessible; one just needs to "walk in."
6.  **"Thicket of views" / "Jungle" / "Tangled"** – Describes the confused, suffering state of an untrained mind caught in its own thoughts and opinions.
7.  **"Going downhill" / "Take the easy way out"** – A metaphor for the path of least resistance in practice: relaxing, letting go, and being present rather than striving and "climbing mountains."
8.  **"Become a 3-year-old child again"** – To enter the "kingdom of heaven" (enlightenment/nibbana), one must regain the wonder, presence, and lack of burdened self-consciousness of a young child.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **Marcus's Job Interview Test:** The story of using the name "Bhikkhu Buddhadasa" as a litmus test to gauge a Thai abbot's spiritual understanding and alignment.
2.  **The Transmission Lineage:** The story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's teacher, Somdet Sangharaj (the Patriarch), visiting him and accepting him as a student after just two hours, emphasizing that enlightenment is an attainable, transmitted lineage.
3.  **The Sangha Disesa (Accusation):** The story of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa being put on trial by a council of senior Bangkok monks for teaching profound Dharma to laypeople ("the wrong people"). His vindication through Pali scholarship solidified his reputation.
4.  **The Western Monastery Schedule:** A story from a participant (Speaker C) about the rigid, impersonal schedule at an Ajahn Chah monastery in the West, contrasted with the more fluid, relational style of Thai "noble" monasteries.
5.  **The Schism of the Second Council:** A historical story reframed: the split between Theravada and Mahayana is explained as a result of rapid growth under King Ashoka, where too many new monks diluted the teaching, leading to a political split. However, the "noble" thread continued in both branches.
6.  **The Lost Hiker:** The advice for a lost hiker to "go downhill" to find water and civilization is used as a parable for taking the easy, natural path out of mental suffering (relaxation, letting go) instead of striving.
7.  **Personal Anecdotes:**
    *   Visiting the aged abbot Luang Por Sherlock in Washington, D.C.
    *   Discovering the "noble" thread within the Lao community in Denver through a student.
    *   Spending time with famous monks like Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho at Wat Suan Mokkh.
    *   Asking Buddhadasa about "try, try again," and receiving the correction: "look at what you're doing."

**Core Function:** These metaphors and stories serve to demystify enlightenment, frame it as part of a living lineage, contrast institutional "Western Buddhism" with a more essential "noble" path, and illustrate key practical attitudes for practice (like curiosity, ease, and thirst for understanding).
