### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh, good morning, friends. This is Saturday morning in Thailand. Uh, it's, um, what is it, November the 15th. All right, halfway through the month. And that, uh, it's, uh, Saturday morning here in Thailand, and this call is.

**Speaker B:** Uh, for.

**Speaker A:** Um, Friday evening in the U.S. So today we're going to talk about several topics, but the first one that we're going to talk about is something that's not even Buddhist. It's Hindu, in fact. Mikey, help me with that word. Is that cha to sotapanna?

**Speaker C:** Okay. Yeah, not sure how it would have been pronounced all those years ago, but yeah, my reading of it is—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I'm not sure, but I've heard the English translation as the Buddha's Fourfold Rejection.

**Speaker A:** And it's not Buddha's, it's rejection. Okay, so the Chatu Sokhi is in fact 4 questions, or let us say a yes or no question that has 4 possible answers. Okay, and the 4 possible answers is yes or no, and the maybes are that it's a combination or both of them, and then it's neither of them. Now, this kind of question was used in ancient India as a philosophy. You could say that this is in fact the ancient philosophy, and if you want to make a mistake about it, you can call it this is Buddhist philosophy. To where we want to really look at Buddhism and the teaching of the Buddha is not a philosophy at all, it's a way of of life, specifically in this moment, moment by moment. So you could say that it in fact is a lifestyle. So this yes, no, both, and neither, I'm going to give a first example of that in the sense of physics, reality, and then we can go into the way that is generally used. Because the way that it's generally used is to try to answer questions that don't have an answer to them. But physics generally has an answer to it. And so the physics question that I ask is, the color yellow, is it red or is it green? Brett, is the color yellow, is it red or is it green? I see you, but I don't hear you.

**Speaker B:** I haven't said anything.

**Speaker A:** Well, hello, Christina. Hello. All right, now I hear you. So, Brett, in physics, is the color yellow, red, or green?

**Speaker B:** Well, in physics, we might— we could measure the peak-to-peak. Right.

**Speaker A:** Nanometers.

**Speaker B:** And so green is around 532. So, and then red is longer. So that would be a smaller number. So, but I wouldn't venture an approximation at this time.

**Speaker A:** So yellow, we have the ROYGBIV, right? R, right, primaries, orange, yellow, then we have green, and then we have blue, indigo, and violet. So green is in the middle, right? And so what you're suggesting is, is that yellow is neither red Nor green, which is one of the four possible answers, right? Okay, now if you've been using computers, and I'll pick on you because you're a scientist a bit, uh, you have probably heard of RGB— red, green, blue. Is that correct? And we use it in computers a lot.

**Speaker B:** A lot. That is correct.

**Speaker A:** Right, we have red, we have green, and we have blue. And in fact, these three colors have been around since the 1960s with color television. Okay, notice that yellow is not there. Red, green, or blue. Now the thing that's really interesting is, is that RGB, or red, green, blue, really doesn't have much of anything to do with with the colors themselves and why computers use those three. Mikey, do you know why they use the RGB?

**Speaker C:** Has to do with the lights that are used on the screen. They use red.

**Speaker A:** Oh, no.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh, yeah. That has to do with the way the human eye is constructed. That we have cones of red, blue, and green cones in the eyes. So where does yellow come from is that it fires both the red and the green, and that's what gives the perception in the human brain of the color yellow. So in that regard, Brett, guess what? The answer is it's both. It's not red, it's not green, it's yellow, which is neither. But the way the human eye works, to get the color yellow, it has to have both the red and the green. So now that we've gotten that, let's go and start looking at the way that it was actually used way back when. It's used to answer questions that have no answer. This is why we call it philosophy. In fact, that's where Greek and Western philosophy came from, was trying to find answers to questions that don't have an answer. Now, the one that we find quite common in the, in the suttas is: does the Tathagata exist after death, or does he not exist after death, or does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death, or does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist? Okay, we've seen that in suttas. In fact, it's in the Majjhima Nikaya several places. This is a standard kind of question that the Hindus would ask. Now, everybody here, when they hear that riddle, they immediately take the word Tathagata out and put the word me, me, me, me, me, me, me in it, in the sense of do I. I mean, who cares about the Tathagata? I want to know, do I exist after death? Or do I not exist after death? Or do I both exist and not exist? Or do I neither exist nor not exist? Now, there is another place where that question is asked, and in fact, you could look at this one in the sense of rebirth and reincarnation. This is the question, and a lot of people go around answering that question as a yes, that's an eternalist, and when they say no, then that's going to be a nihilist. But the Buddha did not answer that question in either of those yes or no frameworks; he did not also answer it in both and neither. Now, let's get another example: Is the world eternal? Or is it finite? So you could actually expand that based upon modern physics to come to the question of, is the universe eternal or is it finite? And guess what? With all of the physics and with all of the telescopes, including the Hubble and the James Webb and all of the radio frequency telescopes that they've got in Brazil and all over the place, They still don't have an answer to that question. They've got some maybes. Maybe everything just disperses into nothing, and maybe it disperses for a while and then comes back and has a Big Bang. In both of those cases, it's eternal. And yet we don't know whether it's eternal or not. In fact, if we look at it from the perspective of a multi-universe, where it's a pop and then it's a bubble and then it bursts, etc., like that. That would be, uh, the, uh, an example of the universe being finite. And even Jesus said that heaven and earth shall pass away. So Jesus was on one side of that, and some of the physics are on the other side, and some of them— so they're going back and forth. But they always want a yes or no answer. Now here's a question for you, Brett. Is the world finite? Is the universe finite, or is it, uh, eternal? I didn't use the word infinite.

**Speaker B:** Now some have suggested it could be finite but unbounded.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now they're playing with words. Now they're getting into philosophy and all of that kind of stuff. In other words, they still want to know the answer to that question.

**Speaker B:** Curiosity may still exist in the human spirit, but— and I'm here referring to the No Boundary Proposal.

**Speaker A:** All right, Stephen Hawking.

**Speaker B:** So he enumerated this with Data, math.

**Speaker A:** So let us say yes, it could exist. Curiosity does exist, but in this case it's misdirected in the sense of, well, the universe exists right now, isn't that good enough? Why do we have to look off into the future about it all? And now we're getting into—.

**Speaker B:** There'S a moment.

**Speaker A:** Hmm, what?

**Speaker B:** However the nature of the universe, it's that right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the way the nature of the universe is, the way that it is right now. And we— okay, so another question that was, uh, asked in that regard was, well, how did the universe get started? Did it happen in an event like a Big Bang, or was the universe always here? And that has that yes or no kind of thing, and then we have the philosophers jump in and say, oh no, the universe was both finite and had a beginning, and it didn't have a beginning. So these are the various questions that the old philosophers were struggling with, way back in the time of the Buddha. Now, there is a fifth answer to this that I want to introduce to you, but you already know it. And that fifth answer is not sure. I don't know. Mikey, do you know whether the universe is infinite or— excuse me, is finite or infinite? Uh.

**Speaker C:** Don'T know and don't need to know.

**Speaker A:** All right, don't go that far. You just don't know. All right, so, uh, I'll go through it all. Does anybody here know any of the answers to these questions? Does rebirth exist or not? Nobody knows, right? Do you know of anybody who knows the answer, the yes or no answer, to any of these questions? Nobody knows. Well, if nobody knows, then that kind of means that we can live our lives quite well without knowing. Is that correct? In other words, it's unnecessary information, or I'll go so far as to use the word irrelevant. The answer to these questions, does the Tathagata exist after death or not, is an irrelevant question. So that gives us 6 answers. The Buddha generally chose a 7th answer. So we have yes, no, both, neither, I don't know, and I don't care. What's the seventh answer? Anybody? The seventh answer that the Buddha almost always used was to change the topic of conversation. He would redirect. In one of the famous suttas, he says, "I do not declare that the Tathagata exists or not exists." after death. I do not declare that he both exists and does not exist. I do not declare any of that. I declare Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. I declare the Four Noble Truths. In other words, he avoids all of those questions. Why? For one thing, they don't have an answer. Hindus, or the old Hindus, the Brahmins, they worked really hard trying to find an answer to that question, and a lot of Buddhists get hung up on trying to pigeonhole it into an answer, and that's why it's referred to as Buddhist philosophy, to where the Buddha was not a philosopher. He was a realist in the sense that it doesn't matter, I don't care. Whether the world is infinite or not. I don't care what the beginning of the world was. I don't care whether the Tathagata exists or not exists after death. And I don't care whether you exist or not exist after death. I don't even care if I exist or not after death. The only— yes, Brad, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** It seems to me like as I've gotten older and partially matured, that philosophy seems like a game for folks that haven't worked through meaninglessness.

**Speaker A:** Yes, precisely.

**Speaker B:** That's the freedom they're in. I mean, am I wrong?

**Speaker A:** Yes, they're still looking for the meaning of life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Where did that come from? It's been around for a long time. Okay, and that would be one of the imponderables. Now, that's the word that the Buddha used for these kinds of questions, is that they have no answer. It's imponderable. Don't give it a thought. And the meaning of life falls into that, though it wasn't specifically registered in the time of the Buddha. But what is the meaning of life? Christina, what is the meaning of life?

**Speaker E:** Oh boy.

**Speaker A:** You don't have an answer, is that correct? That's correct. Yes, it is correct. That's right, you don't have an answer for that. There is no answer to the meaning of life. However, we have an awful lot of people, most of them associated with some religion or another, who think that that's an important question. And in fact, it has no meaning. Now, they say, well, if we've got a god, then God means something. He's got a God's plan and all of that. So that one would be one of the questions that could be asked in that framework. Does God exist? Does God exist? Yes or no? Or maybe both God exists and not exist, or maybe he neither exists nor not exists. But the reality is, does anybody here know that God exists or not? Nobody knows, right? Which means that our lives, which have no meaning at all, is just fine whether a God exists or not, which makes God irrelevant. That's irrelevant. Meaning of life is irrelevant because we don't know and there's no way to find out. And guess what? The physicists are working really hard. I mean, there's millions, sometimes billions of dollars spent— NASA's and James Webb telescopes and all of that kind of stuff— because people really want to know the answer to questions that have no answers to them. And so long as they want something that they do not have, that's what the Buddha calls Dukkha. So, Christina, if you're looking for the meaning of life, that means that you're going to be suffering because you're not going to get a meaning to life. Does God exist or not? You're going to suffer trying to figure that out. And wow, has there been a lot of discussions on that. In fact, there's the Christians and the atheists have gone tooth and tongue about it. And they normally do it in one of two venues. One is they'll do this debate in a church, or number two, they'll do it in a university setting. Now, when it's in a church, most of the people who are in the audience are Christians, and they're rooting for there is a God. And so they'll listen and take in what the preacher says. And they agree with him, and the atheist in the crowd— so at the university, most of the people are going to be atheists, and in the Christian churches, they're going to be Christians. And guess what? When the debate is over, no one changed their mind. The atheist did not convince any of the Christians, and the Christians didn't convince any of the atheists. And nobody knows. Nobody knows. Which means then, I wonder what would happen if someone, a Buddhist, would walk on the stage and say, I don't care whether God exists or not, that's kind of irrelevant. Let's go find out something that's really worth debating about. I wonder if the Christians would start throwing furniture. So this is the point, is that these questions do not have an answer to them. And the Buddha changed the topic. He would change it to what he did teach, and that was Dukkha, Nirodha. That's all he cared about. Now, here's something that Mikey and I were talking about earlier today, and that was that the Buddha was the first and perhaps only one at that time who ever really asked that question. All the philosophers, all the Hindus, all the Jews, and eventually the Christians and the Muslims, none of them ever asked the question, "What is Dukkha and how do we eliminate the Dukkha?" In other words, dissatisfaction. So in that regard, you're talking about Brett curiosity. All the physicists and all the philosophers, they have this curiosity and it burns. It's unsatisfied, unrequited love. In fact, they want to know the answer, and there is no answer to these questions. So, where does that lead us? It leads us that let's not ask those kinds of questions. Let's stay with the kind of questions that can be answered. And there is definitely an answer to what is Dukkha. We can say that it is satisfaction that is denied. That's why we call it dissatisfaction, okay? Or it's disappointment in the face of expecting or making an appointment with something, and then the appointment is not kept, and so we are disappointed. This is what the Buddha was looking for, was how can we live our lives where there is no disappointment right here, right now. If we are good at finding the answer to that question right here, right now, then all we've got is the now. That's all there is, is right now. There is no past, there is no future, so we don't have to ask the question, how can I permanently get rid of Dukkha? The question is irrelevant because we don't have an answer to the future. But we do have an answer to it in the sense of I can remove that Dukkha right here, right now. Brett, you had your hand up. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** We can turn off that projector because our projection sets us up for disappointment, does it not? Yes, future grasping.

**Speaker A:** We can turn off the projector. Now, the Buddha talks about that. That we can, in fact, the projector, or the projection, or the projecting is the problem. That when we see something and we don't know what it is, guess what? We try to make it into something. So when something meaningless comes by, guess what? We try to add meaning to it. We try to use the word because. And we want to find a source of everything. But we can in fact find that there is a source to Dukkha, and that source to Dukkha is wanting something that we do not have, or trying to get rid of something that we don't want to put up with. But those are really the same thing, two sides of the same coin, pushing and pulling. Are both the same kind of effort. So we push or we pull, and we do this unwisely. We do this ignorantly, because if we were wise to it, we would stop the pushing and the pulling, wouldn't we? We would stop that projection, stop trying to figure stuff out, and just be happy with the way things are, even if we don't understand. The way things are. But we are geared, we are required almost by this particular society that we have to find an answer to a question. This is especially true since schools have started using multiple choice questions. You've got to answer something. You've got to choose either A, B, C, or D. A really, really good, wise Buddhist perhaps would hand that paper in unchecked. Don't answer any of the questions. Why? Because they're irrelevant. The only thing that really matters is my relation to the teacher, and if I love him and he loves me, he's going to give me a good grade even if I don't answer the questions on his damn test. What do you think about that, huh? Well, it depends upon how good your relationship is with the teacher. If it's not good enough, then the test becomes more important. But if your friendship with the teacher is what we've got going— and this is really what the Dharma is all about, is how do we relate to the world given that we don't know nothing. We can stay ignorant and still be happy, that we can in fact use wisdom to see that we don't need the answers to any of these questions, that in fact you could say then that asking these kind of questions— does the Tathagata exist after death or not— is an irrelevant question that has no answer to it. And the more we work on trying to find the answer to it, the deeper into dissatisfaction that we will go. So the correct practice then is to stop trying to figure stuff out and just let things be the way that they are without trying to force an answer onto anything. This is the Buddhist teaching discussion of the Four Noble Truths. The First Noble Truth is, in fact, there is dissatisfaction, there is disappointment. Where it comes from is from our own greed to know. It is from our own greed to have and to hold and to obtain and to control. This is where dissatisfaction comes from. But we can drop all of that and come to the state— the Third Noble Truth is that there is a state that is free from dissatisfaction. Free. It's got no problem with it. And the way that we can get into that state is by practicing the Eightfold Noble Path. And what is the Eightfold Noble Path? Number 1, to remember Sati, to look at what's going on. That in fact, in the Sutra number 117, the Buddha talks about the two extremes that come from that kind of questioning, and that is nihilism— nothing exists— or eternalism— it's going to last forever. The Buddha says we're not going to try to choose one of those two; we're going to instead choose to investigate, to look. The more we look and the more we realize that things are constantly changing. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Sometimes the world is caving in on you, sometimes it's going to last forever. Sometimes you think you're going to live forever, and sometimes you're on the corner of death. So things keep changing. Let's make sure that we keep investigating and we begin to see, in fact, I don't know. Then in fact, we can say then that the I don't know is best, it's the best answer. I don't know and I don't care. Let's change the topic to something that's useful and not try to answer all of these questions. So by investigation, by remembering to look and to investigate— now it's not outside that we investigate so much as the inside. We've been investigating the outside for centuries now, and the physicists and the Christians are still arguing over what's out there because neither one of them are looking for what's in here. And so that's one of the major changes that the Buddha made, was stop trying to answer questions about things on the outside and start looking on it in the inside. What is on the inside? We got the body, we We've got our feelings, we've got our attitudes and mental states. And the fourth is we've got the Dharmas, which come in the form of thoughts, observations, all kinds of things that are quite fleeting. They arise and they pass away very quickly. They rot and they die. And then what do we do? Are we going to carry around the dead corpse, or are we going to drop it? This is in fact very close to the Anapanasati Sutta, the last part of it. The Dhamma Nipassana is that everything is changing. Observe, look, see closely that everything is changing. Everything then that is, is in the state of rotting away and is going to die. Let's not carry around a bunch of corpses. This is something that I found quite amusing about physics, is that the physicists are carrying around corpses of things that happened 200, 300 years ago, and the reality is they don't know. I guess that would mean that that would be the death of the profession of astrophysicists. Is it? We don't know. But there's a lot of stuff we don't know. We certainly don't know about politics. A lot of people voted for something that they thought was going to happen, and guess what? Something else happened instead. Tariffs. So we can say then it's best that we stop looking for the outside world and start looking at what's going on inside the mind. Because if we can in fact see what's in the mind, we can see is it in fact wholesome or not. And that wanting something that we don't have is not wholesome. And being satisfied with the way things are That's wholesome. So this is really the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha, is to forget about the yes and no questions that have no answers to them and just be satisfied with the way things are. That's the real key— satisfaction. Why? Because satisfaction in the Pali is Sukkha. Sukkha is exactly opposite of Dukkha. So let's get the mind into a state of satisfaction, and when you're satisfied, Everything is great. That's just it. Everything is good enough. Now, do we have any questions about that? And by the way, Alex, I am so glad to see you, friend. Thanks for showing. He's not going to show.

**Speaker C:** A second to get unmuted.

**Speaker A:** Sorry. Good to see you though. Good to see everyone. So, um, this is really the real teaching of the Buddha, is let's be satisfied with the way things are. As Brett said, let's stop the projecting, let's turn off the projector and just leave the questions unsolved. There's a joke about that, and that is that the seeker, the looker, was looking all over the place. He went to India first and then to China, and finally he wound up in Tibet. And he crawled up this very, very high mountain asking the guru, because he felt somebody's got to know the answer to this question that I have. And the question, he finally found the guru on the top of the mountain, and he asked the question, "What is the key to the universe?" I guess that's like Christina's question, "What's the meaning of life?" "What's the key to the universe?" And the old guru smiled, stroked his beard, and says, don't know the key to the universe. But the universe has been left unlocked. So that's the way that we can look at it, is that there is no answer to all of these questions. But the point is, is that we don't need an answer to any of these questions. We don't need the key to the universe. We don't need meaning, we don't need a God, we don't need any of those kind of things. We can just be happy the way things are. So does anybody have something to say? Oh, Arahant, let's see, you just came on. Thanks for showing up, friend.

**Speaker D:** Um, I get a lot of joy and amusement of talking about existence. Um, and I think it's different if you're coming at it maybe from like Dukkha, like you're looking to find something. I, to me, I have a theory that feels good to me. Everything we know has a cause and effect. You know, part of even the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Is— but the way things are, we don't have to figure out what the causes and what the effects were. I guess the effects are how things are right now, and that's good enough. We don't have to go back and back and back to try to find some original cause. We just enjoy the way things are now.

**Speaker D:** Are you never, uh, like amusingly think about it? Because to me, I think existence itself is the only thing that doesn't have or never had a cause and effect. It's a no beginning and no end, and it's incomprehensible. But it's amusing. It's like, you know, one of the possible options. And an infinite universe existence, even, you.

**Speaker B:** Know, all.

**Speaker D:** Like 14 billion years, that's nothing to infinity.

**Speaker A:** What a marvelous— that number is just made up.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, what a marvelous— like, you can't comprehend existence always existing, something that never had a start. And to me, that is like fascinating. It's very cool. But I think then people will put in like, what does it mean about me? What am I gonna do when I gotta die? And you know, all the religious stuff that comes after instead of just.

**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker D:** Just like something does exist and something it doesn't. And you don't have to answer this, Dhammarato, but what's your gut feeling or hunch? I'm not going to hold you to.

**Speaker B:** It, but.

**Speaker A:** My gut is okay right now.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** It feels fine, not a problem in the world. I don't have to feel anything in particular. So Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Anapanasati. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Brett, let's go ahead and see if we can spend a bit of time on some of the other issues. You ask a question about how do you handle someone who is full of fear, right? Well, if you had a child— now in the West they make even young children sleep in a a room on their own, and all kinds of stuff will come into the mind of the child, and he will become afraid. So the child comes running into the bedroom and says, Daddy, Daddy, there's an Anagami in the closet, or there's a bear under the bed. What is Daddy going to do for that child who is full of fear?

**Speaker B:** Provide nurturing comfort.

**Speaker A:** Nurturing and comfort doesn't really help, though. Dad's got to go take the child back in the bedroom and go ghost hunting. He's got to stick his arm under that bed and feel around, and then pull his arm back, and the child gets surprised and says, got ya, there is no bear under the bed. You look for yourself. You come look. Turn the lights on and see for yourself. This is really the teaching of the Buddha, is that people have to look for themselves. How do you get them to do that? A child getting him to look— I can imagine that a child would be so fearful about the bear under the bed that he won't even look to see. In fact, he wants the bear to stay under the bed. He wants the ghost or the goblin to stay in the closet, and so You won't open the closet to see that the closet is empty. Under the bed, it's empty. So how can you then deal with an adult who is full of fear? You try to get them to look about what they're afraid of, but many of them won't do it. Christians, for instance, are going to be afraid of hell and afraid of a god, but they won't look to say that there is no God, or that whatever God is, is irrelevant. So the real answer is that no one can solve another person's problems. Every child has to look under his own bed. We can encourage people to look under your own bed to see that there's no alligators, there's no crocodiles there, In fact, I do that quite often with students to say, "What's there to be afraid of right now?" You don't have any crocodiles, there's no alligators, there's no Jewish mafia, there's no Russian mafia, there's no CIA, there's no ICE—that's the big boogeyman nowadays. There's nobody here, so why are we afraid? And yet there's where fear is. Guess what? Where is the source of fear? Is it we make shit up? That's where it comes from. So you were talking about your mother. Speak about your mother being afraid, Brett.

**Speaker B:** No, it's not. It's not fear as much as— well, there's some paranoia, but that's neurological based on the Alzheimer's diagnosis. So, you know, what has helped is reassuring her that she's loved. And at the same time, at the same time, my wife can speak to her, you know, in a way that's—.

**Speaker A:** She can see that there is no boogeyman under the bed, that she's got Alzheimer's and she doesn't remember. She needs to keep investigating. That's the whole point about Alzheimer's, is we forget. But guess what? In that case, we've all got Alzheimer's because we all forget. We all have to keep looking under that bed to see that there is no bear under the bed.

**Speaker B:** I wanted to say something. I want to rewind this back to our discussion about mental proliferation and how our curiosity can lead to that. Something that's useful to remember is that we call it insight for a reason, otherwise we'd call it outsight.

**Speaker A:** Insight in, let us say, Western Buddhist parlance is highly overrated.

**Speaker B:** That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the Noble Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The Noble Dharma is that insight means actually looking and seeing. And we keep doing that over and over and over again. You see, in Western Buddhism that we were about to talk about— I'm going to do it anyway— they're looking for some great big grand insight. Oh, I have the answer to the meaning of life. That would be a great big grand insight. But the real insight is right now I don't know. Right now I don't know. And right now I don't know. But the insight has to happen over and over and over and over again. The insight needs to happen moment by moment. In fact, you could say that insight is nothing more than a wholesome thought: "I don't give a damn. I don't know and I don't care. Let's change the subject." And what can we change the subject to? Sukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. Let's be happy. No problems at all. So this is where we're taking this, is that in fact there's that— you brought it up, Alex, about the drawing that was done by Emmanuel Sherman. And the up in the right— excuse me, left top corner, it's a slogan that says, 'Free is now.' And the F of the word free is actually a salamander. And then on the right side going down is the statement, "Oh, boundless joy to find at last. There is no freedom in the world. There's no happiness in the world." Well, think about that. Oh, boundless joy. To find at last there is no happiness in the world. In other words, if the physicists could figure out the beginning of the universe, how long would they be happy? They might pop the corks and have a drink of champagne, but the next day they're out there with their curiosity looking for something new. Because they're looking for their joy on the outside. But when we begin to see that I don't have to be curious, I could just be happy— oh, boundless joy to find at last! I don't have to go find happiness in the world because there's no happiness in the world. Now, for completion's sake, in that drawing there's a little self-portrait of Emanuel Sherman, and I need to talk about him because he's actually quite instrumental to Wat Sumunmokkha. In fact, it was because of Emanuel Sherman that there's an entire building called the Spiritual Theater, and most of the things in the Spiritual Theater by volume was done by Emanuel Sherman. He did most of the artwork. He was a graphic artist in America. He went to Japan for a while, ordained as a Japanese Zen monk, but then he hot-footed it to Wat Soan Mokkh and spent about 10 years with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, wound up at Wat Khao Tom, which is 2 kilometers from here. And he's the one that made Wat Khao Tom famous. And what he did was, he was bound and determined to become enlightened. And so, he sat down under a tree and drew a great big circle around himself, kind of like the Buddha did at Bodh Gaya, and says, "I'm not leaving this circle until I'm enlightened." Funny thing about that, he died of pneumonia because he wouldn't go to the hospital, because he refused, because he kept that vow. That was not a wise thing to do. I would say, in fact, is that the way that I would look at it is that I'm not going to move from this spot because I already am enlightened. What's the point of going to the doctor? What's the point of going to the hospital? I can die happily right here, right now, pneumonia or not. So Emmanuel Sherman was still looking for something, and he was feeling Dukkha because he didn't have what he wanted. But he did an awful lot of good art that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa not just approved of, but he set up an entire spiritual theater about it. And it's really worth the next time you go to Wat Soan Mokkh is to take a deep tour and read every line on every drawing in that theater. It's really worthwhile going. I remember some of them. One of them is a serpent with a mouth open, and that the monk is sitting on the tongue of the serpent, a very poisonous big snake with fangs. Okay, and so you can see then that in fact the fangs of this big serpent is like the world. Can you sit in the mouth of the world safely and just sit there and be happy in the mouth of the snake? That's the same as being happy in spite of the world. There's a lot of drawings like that. Another one is the drawing of a staircase. In fact, the drawing is a staircase. In fact, it's a full painting up to heaven. And standing at the lowest steps on the ladder is an Imam, a Rabbi, a priest, and a Buddhist monk. And what are they there doing? They're blocking the way. So that nobody can get up. This is what religion is all about. Religion actually prevents people from being in the state of paradise that is naturally available to everybody. So I thought that I would add that to you, Alex, so that you can get an appreciation of— Alex, excuse me, Emmanuel Sharon. Yeah, I like that. I did not know that story. Thank you. What do you think? I like it. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yes, I can hear you. Yeah, I like that. Thanks for letting me know about that. I was wondering about the story behind that one. Well, I have said everything I know, but that's enough. So, Karwan, what do you have to say about today's talk? No Karwan.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Nibbana? What do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Hey, Dhammarato. Yes. Wonderful. Wonderful. It's hard to remember in the morning for me that to look right now. I go straight into projection, right? Right as I wake up. And how do I remember that instant? Do I need to put a second alarm or something?

**Speaker A:** And Anna, you had a question about anger. How do you deal with anger, especially with your clients? And the answer is that you can, in fact, as a psychotherapist, you can deal with the anger by, let us say, going past it. In other words, when they are angry and shouting, your job is to not pity party them or say, "Oh, you're right," and comfort them in that regard, but you can laugh at them instead. Just take on joy. That's a hilarious thing. I hear you're angry about something that I think is hilarious. You can get them to come out of it. Why? Because laughter and joy has a power. And the reason why people get angry is because they want power. They feel like that they are oppressed. They feel like that they're afraid of something that might happen. They're afraid of not getting their way, being put down, they were insulted or whatever like that. And that the right way of dealing with that frustration and anger is by seeing that there's really nothing to it. You could also go as far as to say that people, when they're angry, they're looking for some sort of meaning in life. They're looking for the meaning of all this. The answer is it don't mean a thing. Let's just have fun. Their anger, in fact, is of no value. It doesn't gain them anything. It just allows them to feel a little bit of power. But you can gain a whole lot more power through joy. So you can mention that to them. Now, this may take a little bit because they really— people, when they're angry, they really cling to that anger. And then in fact, when you're joyful, they may get even more angry, which would make you more joyful. And when your joy outranks their anger, they'll begin to see through it and begin to recognize, and may even burst out in laughter, seeing that their anger doesn't mean anything. It's just an attempt to feel powerful. But joy is power. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Joy sits in the guts from my last experiences.

**Speaker A:** Oh, yeah.

**Speaker E:** And it's very difficult to get people to the guts because they're so used to being in the heads and many maximum in the heart. So to drop even, I mean, I cannot do it. I kind of like bumping in diaphragm and I cannot drop it down. So because I cannot drop it down, I'm not able to make others joyful because I can't produce it myself.

**Speaker A:** So I'm kind of— You practice being joyful.

**Speaker E:** Looking for something. That's why I guess I'm still not joyful.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's an idea, and that is that certain clients that you have will almost always express anger. They're angry by habit. So when their appointment time comes, you can say, "Ah, Mr. Angry Old Jew is coming. Let me lighten up and be happy so that when he comes, I can spread some joy. Or when the angry old black man comes, you can say, "Aha, he's coming. Let me be joyful. Let me be happy so that I can spread my joy to that angry old black man," or whoever it is. I'm not sure. But be ready for them.

**Speaker E:** I do it already, but then looks like my joy is— They steal it, huh?

**Speaker A:** They rob you of your joy.

**Speaker E:** My joy is gone after I— but I'm able to do what you're saying. The problem is like, where is my joy after? Why I'm not producing like over?

**Speaker A:** Here you go. Once they walk out with their smile on their face, you can say, I got them to be happy after all. And take your bow, take your result. Or if they walk out angry, then you can say, wow, what a relief it is, he's gone. But if you want him to do something and he's not doing it, then that will rob you of your joy. But so you be joyful no matter what happens.

**Speaker E:** This part you taught me 2 years ago. I learned this lesson, so I'm not doing that. But I'm still kind of picking something that's just sitting inside.

**Speaker D:** One thing I found that helped is that you can't really get in trouble for anything, like ever. Even at work, they really don't have any actual power over you. Some of my Employees, I don't know, they'll do something bad and they're like, aren't you gonna yell at me? I'm gonna yell at you? If I yell at you and you punched me in the face, I'd be like, yeah, I deserve that. I don't have any actual like authority or power, even though, you know, if I'm their director or manager, it's— they can't really get in trouble. There's no, like, in reality, if we're just two people outside and I started yelling at them or speaking to them negatively, they either walk away or punch me. Those are like the two outcomes. So that's how I think helps seeing work.

**Speaker E:** But you kind of talk about fear. You talk about fear now more than anger. Am I right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. So you deal with somebody's anger right here, right now by making light of it. It's no big deal. Just like he's talking about that his employee has done something wrong, he's not making a big deal out of it. He's being light with it. Lighten up.

**Speaker E:** My problem, that mentally I'm— I'm— it's somewhere else. It's not in my head. I'm fine with this. It's not in my head. It's somewhere else. This is my problem. I don't have anything here. I see, I— but the rest of the teachers who kind of trying to teach me saying that I am very angry and tensed, and I mean, I may produce it if they tell me too much, too much of that. So I can produce some anger.

**Speaker A:** I, I've known you for a long time, Anna. Long time I've known you, and I don't see the anger there, but I do see Eastern European heritage.

**Speaker E:** So it's a kind of like intergenerational pain, something like that, right?

**Speaker A:** You were raised on that. You didn't get a bottle, you got a Putin to suck on, or something like that. So in that regard, I don't see you as angry at all. If you stop seeing yourself as angry and start seeing yourself as joyful, light, and easygoing— that's what the Dhamma is all about. Have some wholesome thoughts. When that angry man is about to come through the door, you can say, 'I can handle him.' have to deal with his anger. I can be light and happier instead. Go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker B:** Well, I was just going to recall, seemed like a couple of Sanghas ago, Anna was so joyful and her smile was so infectious. It just added to the Dhammasukha of the moment. So call that—.

**Speaker E:** I was the happiest person in the world on Monday. Then I get 2 days of my drop. And then on the end of the second, like third day, my one of the Kundalini teachers told me that I am the angriest person in the world. And I get pretty upset about this energy, so I'm kind of confused what's going on. So he lied to me. So what exactly I'm doing with the lies?

**Speaker D:** Good, except being the angriest person in the world. The Eastern European thing, by the way, that's 100% because I'm from there as well. Americans are very laid back compared to us. For us, it's like we're on fire all the time. And I think if we were back home with our people, this would be more normal, right? Everybody's yelling and screaming and it's totally fine. But then I think being around Americans they're all calm and relaxed and we're like, what's wrong with us? Like, why are we— I'm in New York.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't say that the Americans are calm and relaxed. I'd say that their anger is just different.

**Speaker E:** I don't see calm Americans.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker E:** I don't really see the difference anymore. But anyway. I don't want to blame Americans. I kind of just, I don't have any complaints. For me, they're pretty similar, at least to those who I deal with.

**Speaker A:** Right. You stay with that. I don't have any complaints. That's all we need to stay. It's just, wow, everything is okay. No complaints. No problem. Everything is fine. Angry clients come. People say that I'm angry. It doesn't matter. I'm okay. Don't listen to them. Don't gain your joy from the outside world because there is no happiness in the world. You have to generate that on the inside of your own mind.

**Speaker E:** Exactly. Somebody puts on vodka, it's outside. So if they don't know yet, I think I need to comment on it. So vodka is not inside world, it's outside.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So keep it on the outside. Don't let that stuff in.

**Speaker E:** I can't hear it.

**Speaker A:** I know it's— Well, practice. Practice.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. So that's what I'm doing right now.

**Speaker A:** Good. Good. So, Sean, do you have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. Sorry, I'm glad that you're here. You're breaking up, so we'll go on. Ivan, do you have any last things to say?

**Speaker B:** Nothing. Nothing. Happy.

**Speaker A:** Nothing. Got nothing. I don't know and I don't care. Let's change the topic. All right. So thank you, folks. Thank you, friends. Mikey, can you? Sure thing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Bhikkhu.

**Speaker C:** Thanks for being here today, y'all. And don't be scared. No need to leave. In fact, we invite you to stay. Dhammarato is just going to go take a rest and take it easy.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, centers on the **futility of seeking answers to unanswerable philosophical questions** and the **practical, present-moment focus of the Buddha's teaching**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Stop Asking Unanswerable Questions**
The talk begins by introducing the ancient Indian philosophical framework of the **"Chatu Soki" (Fourfold Questions)**—questions that can be answered with: Yes, No, Both, or Neither. The Buddha rejected using this framework for metaphysical questions because they are **"imponderables"**—they have no answer and lead to endless speculation and suffering (dukkha).

**Examples of such irrelevant questions include:**
*   Does the Tathagata (or a self) exist after death?
*   Is the universe eternal or finite?
*   What is the meaning of life?
*   Does God exist?

### **The Buddha's Practical Response**
The Buddha did not entertain these questions. Instead, he consistently **changed the topic** to what is knowable and actionable: the **Four Noble Truths**.
1.  **There is dukkha** (suffering, dissatisfaction).
2.  **There is a cause of dukkha** (craving, wanting things to be other than they are).
3.  **There is an end to dukkha** (nirvana, peace).
4.  **There is a path to end dukkha** (the Noble Eightfold Path).

The emphasis is on **ending dukkha *here and now***, not on solving abstract puzzles. The pursuit of unanswerable questions is itself a source of dukkha, born from a "greed to know."

### **Key Insights from the Discussion**
*   **"I don't know and I don't care" is a valid, wise stance** toward metaphysical questions. They are irrelevant to the goal of ending suffering.
*   **True insight (vipassana) is moment-to-moment**, not a grand philosophical revelation. It is seeing clearly the nature of craving and letting go *in the present*.
*   **Happiness (sukkha) is an inside job**. Seeking joy or meaning "out there" in the world, in answers, or in future states is doomed. Joy is cultivated internally by being satisfied with things as they are.
*   **The practice is about turning off the "projector"** of the mind that constantly creates stories, expectations, and proliferations (papañca) that lead to disappointment.

### **Practical Applications Discussed**
*   **Dealing with Fear:** Like a child afraid of a monster under the bed, we must investigate for ourselves. The solution is to look directly at the fear to see its emptiness. No one can do this for another; each person must examine their own mind.
*   **Dealing with Anger (in a therapeutic context):** The suggestion is to meet a client's anger not with confrontation or pity, but with **steady, joyful lightness**. This models that anger is not powerful or necessary. Joy is a more potent state.
*   **Cultivating Joy:** One must practice generating inner well-being regardless of external conditions. As the artwork of Emmanuel Sherman referenced in the talk stated: *"Oh, boundless joy to find at last there is no happiness in the world"*—meaning freedom comes when you stop seeking happiness externally.

### **Conclusion**
The talk reinforces that **Buddhism is a lifestyle of practice**, not a philosophy. The path is about:
*   **Letting go** of the need for answers.
*   **Investigating** the mind in the present moment.
*   **Cultivating satisfaction** (sukkha) with the way things are.
*   **Following the practical path** laid out by the Buddha to uproot the cause of suffering here and now.

The final exhortation captures the spirit: **"Don't worry about the outside world. You're not going to find any joy there anyway. Just be happy."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Color Yellow (Physics & Perception):** Used as an initial, concrete example of the "fourfold" logic (yes/no/both/neither). The color yellow is shown to be *neither* red nor green in terms of wavelength, but *both* red and green in terms of how the human eye (RGB cones) perceives it. This illustrates how a single question can have multiple valid answers depending on the frame of reference.

2.  **The Projector:** A metaphor for the mind's tendency to project meaning, expectations, and stories onto reality. The advice is to "turn off the projector" to stop creating scenarios that lead to disappointment (dukkha).

3.  **Carrying Corpses:** A metaphor for clinging to past thoughts, observations, and dead ideas. The speaker contrasts this with letting go of what has arisen and passed away, suggesting that holding onto mental "corpses" is burdensome and unwise.

4.  **The Snake's Mouth:** Referenced from the art of Emanuel Sherman, this image symbolizes the world's dangers (like a poisonous serpent). The challenge is to learn to sit peacefully and happily even "in the mouth of the snake"—to find peace amidst the perils of existence.

5.  **The Blocked Staircase:** Another image from Sherman's art, where religious figures (Imam, Rabbi, Priest, Monk) stand at the bottom of a staircase to heaven, blocking the way. This metaphor criticizes institutional religion as something that can prevent direct access to spiritual peace, rather than facilitating it.

6.  **The Bear Under the Bed / Ghost in the Closet:** A classic childhood fear used as a metaphor for all unfounded anxieties. The solution is to "look under the bed"—to investigate the fear directly with wisdom and see that there is no real threat. This is applied to adult fears about God, meaning, the afterlife, etc.

7.  **The Locked Universe:** Used in a concluding joke/story. The seeker looks for the "key to the universe," but the guru says the "universe has been left unlocked." This metaphor reinforces the core message: we don't need a special answer or secret knowledge to be happy; peace and freedom are already accessible.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha's Redirection:** The central story from the suttas is how the Buddha responded to metaphysical questions (like "Does the Tathagata exist after death?"). He refused to answer within the fourfold framework (yes/no/both/neither) and instead redirected the conversation to practical matters: the reality of *dukkha* (suffering) and the path to its cessation.

2.  **The Physicists' Endless Search:** The talk repeatedly references modern physicists and cosmologists spending vast resources to answer questions about the universe's origin, size, and fate. This story is used to illustrate "misdirected curiosity"—the endless, unsatisfying search for answers to imponderable questions that the Buddha deemed irrelevant.

3.  **The God Debate:** The story of debates between Christians and atheists, where neither side ever changes their mind, is used to demonstrate the futility of arguing over unanswerable questions. It highlights that such debates are driven by a need for certainty rather than a search for truth.

4.  **The Story of Emanuel Sherman:** The tale of the artist who drew a circle and vowed not to leave until enlightened, ultimately dying of pneumonia. This story serves as a cautionary example of how even spiritual seeking can become a form of *dukkha* if it's rooted in wanting something you don't have. It contrasts with the message of being content "here and now."

5.  **The Father and the Fearful Child:** A simple, practical story about a child afraid of a monster under the bed. The wise father doesn't just offer comfort; he investigates *with* the child, showing there's nothing there. This story directly models the Buddhist teaching of "investigation" (*dhamma vicaya*) as the antidote to fear and delusion.

6.  **The Angry Client & The Joyful Therapist:** While not a single story, the extended discussion about how a therapist (Anna) should handle angry clients builds a narrative. The suggested approach is to meet anger not with confrontation or absorption but with unshakeable, internal joy, thereby "disarming" the anger by not feeding the energy it seeks.

**Core Narrative Arc:** The talk itself follows a story-like structure: it starts with a puzzle (the fourfold questions), shows how even science can't provide final answers, reveals the Buddha's revolutionary refusal to play that game, and concludes with practical metaphors and stories for how to live a happy, fearless life free from the need for such answers.
