### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Welcome to the Saturday Morning Call. It's 9 o'clock in Thailand and it's Friday evening in the US. Today we're going to continue with our conversations about the Dhamma, and today we're going to be talking about what is actually the Dhamma, what is actually the teachings of the Buddha, and what is not. And that when we say what is the teachings of the Buddha, we're talking about a path that he gave that is easy, it's possible, and it is something that everybody can do. They can come see for themselves. And then there is a Dhamma that is difficult, hard to practice, and yet it's the most common kind of thing. Now, I would like to read you a Pali passage. This is out of the Dhamma Nipasanathi, and it is savako bhagavata dhamo sandictiko akaliko ehipasiko opaniko pachatam Vedibo vinuti tam dharmam saranam gacchami. Now, what that actually is saying is that Svako Bhagavata Dhammo is the Dharma is well expounded by the Blessed One. Sanditiko means that it's visible here and now. All you have to do is look and that you can see it. Akaliko means that it's timeless, that there's not a delay in the benefits that you got, that you get immediate benefits. Ehipassiko means come and see for yourself. And then Anapanasati means that you have to lean inward, that you have to come inside to see for yourself. And then Paticcasamuppada Vedibhavo Vinayati means to be realized individually by the wise. Now we're actually putting it out that the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path does lead to the end of Dukkha. If you're practicing it correctly, it can lead to the end of Dukkha right now. But the next now that you have, you've got to repeat the process until you develop the skills. Now, one of the major mistakes that a lot of people make, and we'll come back and talk about this later, is that an Arahant or a Buddha is perfect in the sense that he never ever has any more unwholesome thoughts. And yet I've defined more than 20 different suttas, 20 more than 20, of where the Buddha still had to deal with his own unwholesome thoughts, but he did so immediately. That's what an Arahant is, is that he doesn't let the house builder actually build the house. As soon as the house builder shows up, Aha, I've caught you! That's what this is all about, is that you're not ever going to get your mind completely clean and completely perfect, but you should be able to develop the skills up to the point that you do not entertain the crap that you used to entertain. That when you're making up stories, you know you're making up stories. And so this is— and know that whether the story-making that you're doing is wholesome or not. That's basically the whole path. However, Buddhism itself has become quite a lot of stories. It's gotten quite complicated, and as this complexity has set in, that setting-in process has brought a lot of stuff from other religions and other places into what is now considered Buddhism, which is where it's not. And that what we're doing today is we're saying that the teaching of the Buddha is specific. It does have a technique, and if you practice that technique over and over and over again, you'll get very, very good at practicing that technique, but you'll never become perfect. But you will become happy almost all the time. Why? Because anytime any unhappiness comes up, you can say, 'Aha, I see that,' and then change it back to happiness again. However, all of this stuff that's come in that's called Buddhism brings an idea of kind of perfection, or a path that's difficult to do, or a Bodhisattva ideal that takes lifetimes and lifetimes times to perfect, to where we're not actually looking for perfection, we're just looking for this moment being a really good moment. So there is actually a sutta that covers this topic that has to do with what happens when counterfeit Dharma comes in, and I've asked Alex to get that ready. Alex, are you ready to read your sutta? Sure, all right, go right ahead. I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** So this is SN 16.13, and the translator titled it The Counterfeit of the True Teaching. So I have heard, at one time the Buddha was staying near Samadhi in Jetta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then Venerable Mahakaspa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more awakened Bhikkhus? And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer awakened Bhikkhus? That's how it is, Kasapa. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing, there are more training rules and fewer awakened Bhikkhus. The true teaching doesn't disappear as long as the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn't appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world, then the true teaching disappears. It's like native gold, which doesn't disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasn't appeared in the world. But when counterfeit gold appears in the world, then native gold disappears. In the same way, the true teaching doesn't disappear as long as the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn't appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world, then the true teaching disappears. It's not the elements of earth, water, fire, or air that make the true teaching disappear. Rather, it's the silly people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear. The true teaching doesn't disappear like a ship that sinks all at once. There are 5 detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. What 5? It's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Sangha, the training, and mental composure. These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. There are five things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. What five? It's when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain respect and reverence for the teacher, the teaching, the Sangha, the training, and mental composure. These five things lead to the continuation, persistence, and endurance of the true teaching. The end.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so let's unpack that just a little bit. One thing that's in the sutta is, is that when the counterfeit comes, the original or the valuable disappears. I would say offhand that that's not actually true. And the example that I would give would be in China right now, a lot of counterfeit gold is being sold. And because of that, it's actually hurt their market, but it hasn't actually destroyed to the point of nonexistence the gold market, but it has devalued it. The same thing would be with counterfeit money. That it is said that North Korea has whole buildings stacked with counterfeit $100 bills, and yet that counterfeit money hasn't actually destroyed the value of the US dollar. There's other things that are doing that. But we also could say that the diamond industry, natural diamonds that were so valuable up into the thousands of dollars per carat depending upon the size, etc., like that, has in fact quite deteriorated because of counterfeit diamonds, which are actually real diamonds that can be manufactured now with heat and pressure that can be controlled in modern times. And so there's some truth to that. But we can say that we're lucky that in fact, the actual teachings of the Buddha have not been destroyed by the counterfeit, but wow, it sure has had a major influence. Now, the sutta also kind of indicates that the counterfeit Dharma actually began during the lifetime of the Buddha, that it didn't actually occur until later, that it actually started to occur in the time of the Buddha. Now, what we would mean by a counterfeit Dharma is that people come in, learn a little bit of Dharma, think they know it all, and then start mixing it with stuff that they've learned from their past and bring that in as if it were the real Dharma. Now, one of the things that we can see that's the difference between counterfeit Dharma and the actual real Dharma, as I said, is that the real Dharma is immediate and you get immediate benefits. But the counterfeit, you don't get those immediate benefits. It may take you a long time and still working very hard and get no results. This would be true of Western Buddhism in particular when they are talking about and practicing things like Vipassana meditation Insight meditation, dry practice of meditation, and other things like this, it is all built upon the Visuddhimagga. Now the Visuddhimagga is a very interesting piece of literature, because it seems like that in fact a lot of the monks throughout the ages thought that this was an addition to or a completion of the Buddha-Dhamma. But if we do a close inspection like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, we come to find out that, oh no, at secret points it makes a turn from an easy practice into a difficult practice. Now, one of the things that they talk about in the Visuddhimagga that way would be like the 16 stages of insight. That's where the Western idea comes from, getting a dark night of the soul. Well, we can see immediately that the teaching of the Buddha has always been called good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. So if there is a dark night of the soul in there, you can tell that that's a counterfeit Dhamma. There's a lot of stuff in the Visuddhimagga just like that. A few weeks ago, we had a talk on the Pāramīs, and there we saw that the Pāramīs actually talk about it takes a long time to develop these. And yet at the same time, these Pāramīs were in fact ordinary things that ordinary people do, that they're actually— most of them are not even noble. Like Dhamma, for instance. Why should that take a lifetime to learn to practice Dhamma when in fact all you need to do is write me a check? Except that there's no place to send it. So the, uh, the point is, is that, uh, there's a lot of counterfeit Dhamma. And the Dhamma that we're going to be talking about today, and I wish that Karuna is here because he's the one that asked the original question about the 10 fetters. Now, the first 3 fetters are in the suttas and they have very valuable qualities to them. The first 3 are personality view, attachments to rights, rules, rituals, and shoulds, woulds, coulds, idealism, etc. And that the third one is the doubt about what is the path, what is and what is not the path. Now, people who are practicing a counterfeit practice will begin to attach to certain words and things like this, saying, oh, that word is a harsh word, without even considering the text or the value of it. They're just clinging to their idealism about what should be. People also will consider that they know what the path is, and in fact they the path that they are practicing doesn't give them liberation right then and there. And so they become attached to a path. So their path that they have no longer doubt for is nothing actually but some set of rules or rituals. Now, today I want to make sure that we talk about what is personality view because personality view is a central core teaching of the Buddha, in the sense that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said that nothing is worth clinging to as I, me, or mine. Now what he actually meant was anything that you cling to, you will be clinging to as it were mine. You can't cling to something without having a clinger. You have the cling-on and then you have the clinger, and the clinger is in fact the one who is selfish at that point in time. And if we understand personality view, we can see, number one, it's not fixed. You are a moving target. Number 2, you can't define who you are, but you could get a profile list. You could say, okay, today I'm going to write down every attribute that I have, and you write that list down. It may take you pages. A month or a year later, you go back and do the same thing, and you'll find it's not the same list, that you've changed, and so has your list of things. And so the only real way that we can look at it is watch the changes and make some wholesome changes. This is the way that you would appreciate it. So we have these first three fetters: personality view, clinging to rights, rules, and rituals, which in Nepali is called Sila, Bhavana, Paramita, And then the doubt about what is the path and what is not the path. And here we're actually referring to the Eightfold Noble Path, which is what we're practicing here. And when you begin to see that the Eightfold Noble Path, when practiced correctly, is actually liberating right then and there, you come out of your Dukkha right then and there. You can be happy right now. That even though the Buddha still had unwholesome thoughts, he could change them immediately. He could see, aha, I see you, Mr. Mara. Aha, I see you, house builder, and I'm not going to give you a chance. In modern language, we could go so far as to say, aha, I see you storytelling, and I'm going to stop the storytelling before the story is finished. We're going to stop the storytelling and see what things are really about, coming back to the reality of the situation. Now, these three fetters are actually in the suttas. The place where you can get a very good idea of them is in Sutta Number 2 in the Saddha Asava Sutta. Where the Buddha points out that if you can see the Four Noble Truths, if you can see that this is Dukkha, that you can see that this is your cause of Dukkha, and you can see that you can come out of it right then, and you can see that you've got a method to come out of it right then, then that's really the entire practice. Now, this practice of removing, or let us say attacking at least, these three fetters is normally referred to as Srotapanna. Now, the state of Srotapanna is a little bit more complicated than that. In fact, it has also elements in not only knowing what is and what is not the path, but also we have the quality— I'll use the word forgiveness— that we can forgive ourselves of our sin in the past and go forward watching to make sure that we're not sinning anymore. I use the word sin because that's the word that Christians use. We can use it in the sense of unwholesome or wrong conduct. We can forgive ourselves for our wrong conduct, get over it, forget about the past, and come along living quite well because we're actually now spending a lot of time, much of the time, most of the time, almost all of the time in looking at what is the Dharma, what is the teaching of the Buddha, and we become delighted in that. And that state of delight, when you are delighted in the Dharma, when you can think, I can't think of anything else that's worth even thinking about other than the Dharma. And so when we have that idea that the Dharma is really the best thing to spend our time with, that would then be considered the fruit of the Sotapanna. Now also, we have not just the Sotapanna, but we have the Arahant, and the Arahant would be like the Buddha, who is so good at catching unwholesome thoughts that he doesn't even let the story finish. These are the two states. We could say the seeker and that, and the one who is no longer seeking because he can see clearly. So you have the Srotapanna and the Arahant. Now, in later literature, much later in some cases, you'll have intermediate stages of, uh, uh, Sotagami and Anagami. And I'm going to put it to you right here that those two states are counterfeit. The Buddha did not teach Sotapanna and Anagami as intermediate stages between the Srotapanna and the Arahant, when in fact the Srotapanna and the Arahant are actually quite close together, that you can make a jump correctly. And the only jump that you're making is instead of seeing your unwholesome thoughts on an irregular basis, now you're seeing your unwholesome thoughts on a regular basis. That's the main distinction. Along with that, there are, they say, 10 fetters. Well, the Fourth and the Fifth fetter are considered greed and ill will, but those two things are also the cause of Dukkha, and we can see then that the Second Noble Truth actually refers to the cause of Dukkha, as a threefold item. One is greed, ill will, and the third one is ignorance or stupidity. And if we can see those first three fetters as the eradication of that ignorance so that it's knowledge, then we've got one out of three knocked out. The second two are actually quite interrelated. That when you get angry, you get angry because you're not getting what you want. And when you don't get what you want, not only anger but disappointment, trying hard, frustrations, and all of that kind of stuff. So what I'm actually saying is, is that greed and ill will are actually two sides of the same coin, and that they are dropped together, that there's not one and then the other, that today I'm going to work on my greed and tomorrow I'm going to work on my anger. That's not how it works. You drop them together, and how you drop them together is right now, not today and tomorrow, but right now. You can just drop it. You can see it and finish with it. So we can also say that not only is the Sotagami and the Anagami part of the counterfeit Dharma, we can see that the distinction between greed and ill will is also counterfeit, leaving us only four fetters. The four fetters would be personality view, attachments to the way things ought to be, lack of knowledge about the path or the knowledge of what is and is not the path, which is the first 3, which would be— let us call it wisdom or knowledge. And then the 4th one would be the greed and ill will that are dropped together. So we've reduced 5 down to 4. Now these first 5 were always considered Rupa fetters. But someone, somewhere, sometime by the Abhidhamma or into the Visuddhimagga decided that they're going to invent 5 new ones. The 5 new ones then are those that are specifically for the Arahant. And I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what all of that was. Now in the Visuddhimagga, it lists them as the 5. Is rupa-raga, arupa-raga, panna or conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Those are the five. Now I'd like to look at what you could call rupa and arupa-raga. The rupa-raga is merely the self attaching to physical form, physical things. I want to live. And the Arupa Raga is, I don't want to live anymore, I want to die. You could even call the Arupa Raga a death wish, wanted to get out, don't want it anymore. This is when people commit suicide, it's because of this death wish of not wanting to deal with reality because they don't have the skills to do it. Now, the point is, is that in the Visuddhimaga, They say, oh no, wait a minute, wait a minute, we've got a better definition of rupa and arupa raga. And that is, is that people who have rupa raga are attached to the form jhanas, which is 1 through 3. And the arupa raga is people who are attached to the formless jhanas, normally jhana number 4. Well, let me ask you this. How many of you I'll pick on Alex again. Alex, when did you figure out that you had a lust and a desire for formless jhanas?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't think I figured that one out yet.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? You may have never ever had any formless jhana desire. So arupa raga, according to the Visuddhimagga, is not correct. But you have had death wishes even as a child. I want out of this, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it makes a whole lot more sense to treat this as a death wish than it is a desire for formless jhanas. Because how many people in the world have never heard of jhanas? They don't have any desire for these, uh, arupa jhanas. But I could bet you this, almost everyone who's ever lived don't like it sometimes and they want out. In fact, the story is, is there I was in this beautiful hot tub. Sometimes it was nice music playing. We got all the delicious food that we needed right into the belly, and all of a sudden the earthquake happened. The bottom dropped out, and the next thing I know, Dr. Young has grabbed me by the heels and is beating my ass. Well, I let out a scream so loud that I didn't even stop screaming until I was 35. Now that scream that the infant gives out is, "I don't like this. I do not want to be alive." That arūpārāga is in fact deeply buried into us in that divide, in that shovel, that we have between do I want to exist or do I not want to exist. In fact, Shakespeare had a whole play built around this, and the name of the play, by the way, was Hamlet. And what is the famous point that Hamlet was at the end of this play? Anna, do you know what Hamlet was saying? To be or not to be, that is the question. So this hardness that we have, this conflict that we have within, is actually a conflict between two different parts of ourself. This is actually just another expression of personality view. Arupa and rupa-raga is not about jhanas, it's about our existence. Do we want to exist or not? And the reason we often don't want to exist is because we don't like what's going on and we don't have any clue about what to do about it. But once we get that third fetter out of the way, once we do know what is the right path, the rupa and arupa raga don't mean much anymore. Now the next point would be Panna. Panna is also translated as to the word conceit, but it also has to do with competition or comparing ourselves with someone else. How am I doing, Daddy? What's it all about? How do I compare? This is the source of all competition, and look how much competition there is between humans. What with wars, with grades in school, chess, gaming, all kinds of things. People want to get that ego hit because they want to win, but they don't like it when they lose. And so mana is in fact a comparison, uh, that going back to that point about Rupa, Rupa Raga, depending upon whether you win or lose the game. And someone who is wise doesn't play games anymore. Why? Because that sets one up to be selfish. Oh, I won, or oh, I lost. So why play games when it's only going to bring you into a point of selfishness again? Now, the next one would be fourth on the list, is called Anagami. Restlessness. Now guess what? Restlessness is also considered a hindrance, and that's something that we do right at the beginning of the path. Why did they put it at the end of the path? That doesn't make any sense at all. But it does point out that when we do have restlessness, it's me who wants to do something. So actions and the being that does the actions are interrelated. It has to do with wanting to do something. Now, in Sutra number 57, the Buddha talks about— the name of the sutra, by the way, is the Dog Duty Aesthetic, where this guy is— it's a form of Hinduism. I actually saw a Dog Duty Aesthetic in Hyderabad when I was in India at one time. They walk around on all fours, they crawl around, they eat their food off the dirt, they don't eat it out of a plate. They pretend to be a dog. The dog-duty ascetic went to the Buddha and says, what happens? And the Buddha says, oh, one of two things. If you fail at being a dog-duty ascetic, you'll feel really bad and wind up in your own hell. But if you do succeed at being a dog duty ascetic, that means you're going to be a dog. The dog duty ascetic, he didn't like that. He was thinking that he would be getting enlightenment from that rather than whatever. And so the Buddha then described to him and the cow duty ascetic four kinds of Kamma. Normally we think of Kamma as two kinds. You do good actions, you get good results. You do bad actions, you get bad results. But the Buddha added two others, and one was almost all your actions are mixed. All actions are mixed and their results are mixed. But the fourth one, the fourth kind of action, he says, is neither bright nor dark. It doesn't have good or bad qualities to it. It's just action. But this action leads to the end of action. It leads to the end of being restless, so that we can in fact stay restful all the time, because it's the self that wants to go do stuff. So the last one, the ignorance, which is in this list of higher fetters, We could say at one time I thought that, oh, that means that we want to know. We want to know all about this, that, and the other thing. We want a PhD in this and a PhD in that. We want to know everything. But actually, that's just an ordinary way of looking at it, and that in that regard, we will always remain ignorant. The question is Are you okay being ignorant? Well, there's another way of looking at it, and that is that the real ignorance is the ignorance of when you are selfish or not. And if you are on your guard, if you are watching, then when selfishness arises, "Aha, I see you, Mr. Selfishness." And when there is no selfishness, then we know that that's true also. So to reiterate, these 5 higher fetters— they call them higher. In fact, in the suttas, or actually in the Visuddhimagga, they're called arupa fetters, where you have rupa raga, arupa raga, Panna or conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Those are all aspects of that personality view. The very first item on the list of fetters. And so these are actually more refined things, but there's no reason to be more refined. What we're going to do instead is develop the skills to be able to see them whether they're refined or not. So with this, we can say that predominantly works like the Abhidhamma and the Vasudhi Marga are actually counterfeit Dhammas because they actually take more time. They slow you down on your path of practice. And sometimes the counterfeit even takes you in the wrong direction. An example of that would be a whole group of people are using a particular word and you come along and say, "Oh, I don't want you to use that word," or, "You're being harsh," and they'll say, "Oh, we're just having fun." 'No, you're harsh, you're harsh, you're harsh,' and you harp on it for 10 days. 'Oh, you're being harsh.' The question now is, who's harsh? The ones who were using the word happily, or the one who's saying, 'You cannot do that word because my, um, Sila, my, uh, set of rights, rules, and rituals says you can't use that word, and I'm going to make you feel really bad until you agree to stop using the word.' That's kind of funny, isn't it? So if you can in fact just let words be, there is no particular word that's good or bad. There's only our own personal aversion to some words based upon our deep past. An example of the word shit— how many people you have aversion to the word shit? You don't like to see it, you don't want it in print, you don't want to have a But then there's a lot of us who see the word shit as a funny word. I like it. It points out things that people don't want to see. All right, in fact, in the Thai language there is the word khee, and they use that word for all kinds of shit. Oh, and I mean that literally, all kinds of shit. An example would be the ash of a cigarette is khee buri. The ash of a fire, uh, uh, they also call that ki. The, um, the, uh, uh, kinam is piss. Uh, kitua, I think, is one of the words that they use for, uh, your own, uh, number 2 doo-doo. So we can use the word shit happily. Or we can say, "Oh, that's a bad word. You shouldn't be using it." How about other words? A lot of the words that we have that we call low-class words are actually sexual words. Now, one of the things about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa that I enjoyed very much is that he was known to use low-class language to teach the Dhamma. He would use that to get people's attention. He would say things like that so that people— and in fact, one of the words that he used was the word 'goo.' Now, in Thai language, the word 'goo' is a very low-class, selfish word for a self, as opposed to 'chan' or 'pom,' which would be high-class words. So he would use low-class words to get people's attention and that we can do that with the Dharma also, knowing that occasionally somebody's going to come along being really attached to that word. Oh, you can't use that, that's a harsh word. Oh, that's a terrible word to use. You can't use the word stupid. You can't use the word shit. You're a Dhamma dude. To where there's nothing really wrong with any particular word. What's the problem is people's attachment. To it and comparison with others. In fact, when somebody says, "Oh, you can't use that word," he's actually in a state of Panna by comparing his set of rules with your set of rules. He's also in his set of rules, and this is also a form of selfishness. So basically, you could say then almost everything that the Buddha taught was about how to come out of our selfishness by being aware of the thoughts that we think that are in fact selfish thoughts, so that we can stop being selfish and start enjoying our life as it really is, free from all of that. So to wind up with this talk, we can say then that most of the teachings of Buddhism is actually counterfeit Dhamma, because it slows us down and prevents us from actually being joyful in this moment. So if you go around judging people saying, oh, you shouldn't talk like that, or you shouldn't be that way, guess what? You're harming your own practice. There's your own form of Mara coming in in the form of an unwholesome thought. Like, aha, I'm better than he is because he's using the word I don't approve of. So this is the real teaching of the Buddha. The real teaching of the Buddha is to see your own unwholesome thoughts right now and come out of them before they get too far deep into storytelling. And that's really all there is to it. The teaching of the Buddha is very, very simple, and the teachings of Buddhism is vast, but it's almost all counterfeit. The Paramitas are counterfeit, the Jhanas are counterfeit, the fetters are counterfeit, the stages of enlightenment, especially those middle stages of Anagami and Srotapanna. They're counterfeit. You can go directly from, aha, I really enjoy the Dharma, into I'm going to watch every thought. You can go from Srotapanna to Arahant in one step. You don't have to wait 7 lives or this, that, and the other thing. And all of these stories about how long it takes is not the teaching of the Buddha.

**Speaker C:** Panna.

**Speaker A:** Buddhist teaching is simple, and you can get simple results by practicing simply, but practicing often. So, Ben, what do you say? Ben, you're not here, huh? Oh yeah, just pick on somebody else. Okay, how about you, Christina? What do you think? Gonna say this is good shit, Dhammarato? Pardon? I hear you talking.

**Speaker D:** I said it's good.

**Speaker E:** Shit.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's not play with counterfeit money, counterfeit gold, counterfeit diamonds, or counterfeit Dharma. Let's do the real thing. Harold, good to see you, friend. What do you have to say? Oh, Mr. Ben, you finally showed up. Harold, let me hear you.

**Speaker D:** Uh, no, sounds good.

**Speaker C:** Uh, good in the beginning, good at the end.

**Speaker A:** So if your Dharma is not good right now, whatever you're in— the beginning, middle, or end— if it's not good right now, it's not Dharma, it's counterfeit. That's a good point. Mr. Ben, what do you think? Yeah, we don't need counterfeit Dhamma. We don't need to make shit up. The actual practice is stopping making shit up. When we just stop doing that, everything's easy. Everything right here and now is easy. Nothing to it. Yes, when we can see that house builder, that storyteller, we can stop it. Ivan, what do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** I'm very happy every time you say the word.

**Speaker C:** Shit.

**Speaker E:** Remember the first few calls I had? I can't remember the context. Pretty sure I was complaining about something. And then you say I made that shit up and I got very upset. But then I realized that whatever I was doing for a long time doesn't work, so let me just listen. And I practice, and I got the benefit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm really glad that you've gotten the benefit. You hang in there, friend. How about you, Scott? I see you've got yet another naked cat.

**Speaker F:** Yeah. This is a talking cat. Yeah, I agree with everything you said, especially about, you know, making the Dhamma too complicated, getting into all these weird esoteric texts and commentaries that kind of.

**Speaker B:** Just.

**Speaker F:** Create all kinds of you know, barriers to practice, where practice is simple and direct and experiential, right? So if it's not immediately accessible, it's not the Dhamma. So I agree, I agree.

**Speaker A:** Good. So Alex, do you have something to say now?

**Speaker B:** Everything sounds good. I really liked it. That's all I've got to say.

**Speaker A:** Kyro or Kroyo. I don't know how to say it.

**Speaker G:** It's Kryo. It just means cold in Greek. I agree with what you're saying about the accessibility of Dhamma. I didn't really catch the whole talk. I just came in for the last little bit of it. But what I would say is people who take the approach to speak in those skills in the unskillful way as a means of skill is a definite version of Upaya. That's Upaya right there, in my opinion. And that's very much what the Buddha taught.

**Speaker A:** Anything else?

**Speaker G:** Well, I'll admit to you, I still practice Tibetan Buddhism, so I understand what you said about the whole counterfeit Dharma stuff. I've seen a lot of things, even when I talked to my actual teacher about it, where he said this is actually lifted from Kashmir Shaivism. This isn't originally from the Buddha, and he said so.

**Speaker C:** So it's just true.

**Speaker A:** Yes, all of the various countries in Southeast Asia or in Asia have a mixture. I'll make this point. The teaching of the Buddha does not interfere contradict, kill off any other religion. What it does instead is saddles up beside it, infiltrates it. So if we have Tibetan Buddhism, what that means is, is that we have the Tibetan culture that has been invaded by the Noble Dharma. And most people, especially Westerners, can't tell the difference. In fact, they confuse completely They think that Tibetanism is in fact the Dhamma, to where the Dhamma is completely separated from the teachings of the Buddha and Tibetanism. You can see that in Thailand. Thailand is not as strong or hard to miss as it is in Tibet, But Thailand also has an ancient religion. We don't even have a name for it. I guess the Thais do, but you can refer to it as animism. And many of the Thai people mix those two religions together, not recognizing that one's liberating, the other one's not. And so they'll often go for the one that's more friendly to them, the one that they were raised on. Even though that it's not actually liberating. So RJ, what do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** I think, yeah, it's every time I hear your talk, it just makes me understand it more. And also like it's really beneficial. I can see it in everyday life. So, and these talks help me kind of keep the Sati. So I'm able to practice it better if I come to these talks.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it helps remind you. And actually these talks help me too.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and one more thing I'm feeling these days is I find myself very lucky and to have found this Dharma because My life has changed for good in many aspects, like the whole happiness and also in worldly things like, you know, success at career, office work, those things also. They all became better, surprisingly, even when I'm less worried about them. So I find it great.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** When we stop telling ourselves stories that make us sad, sad, we have stories that make us feel good.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And the hard work, like the hard work that used to be hard and kind of punishing in the sense I'm so tired, why do I have to do it? It has become much more easier to do.

**Speaker A:** Right. And the easier life. Yes, your life too. Yeah. Until you come to the state.

**Speaker D:** Of Anicca. It's helping me like every day on next step. I can see that all the time.

**Speaker A:** Quite catch what you said.

**Speaker D:** So what I'm saying is I can see the benefit at like every step and every day of my life now.

**Speaker A:** Okay. How about you, Karmakal? Do you have anything to say? Great talk, I just caught the tail end of it. Can't wait to learn more, Dhammarato, thank you. All right. So we have a new person, Zen T. Do you have something to say? Hey, it's just Siri. I don't have anything to say. I didn't catch the whole talk, but.

**Speaker C:** I'm really happy to be here, and I'm just listening and absorbing.

**Speaker A:** And thank you so much. So anybody else have anything to say? Nibbana, have I picked on you yet?

**Speaker C:** Not yet, but Thank you so much. I mean, I resonated with everything you said. I just sometimes cannot believe— I think you're doing magic on us. It's so beautiful. But you know, one of the things you said about competition, it is so strong here in the West. I didn't realize it. Just almost everything is based on competition. The other day I told my manager, I just said, you won, like you were winning. And that just shut her up. She just was like so happy that she won. I don't even know what she won, but she was happy to win and that was it. I was like, this is not the way you want to conduct your life. Winning is— it's not about winning.

**Speaker A:** Well, it is about winning. Winning your life. Winning your own happiness.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Winning your own success. Not these little things. Not competition with other people, but you get this deep sense of Um, I would say confidence. Okay, almost to the point of becoming unmovable. It is really hard for people to sway you and move you when you really do understand that you're okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker H:** Sure thing. Yeah. Thank you, friends, for being here today. Always glad to see new people join this call as well. And yeah, remember to join us here on the Dhamma Friends Discord. If you're watching on YouTube or listening on Spotify or iTunes, you can find a link to join in the YouTube subscription. We also have quite a few different channels on the Discord. Some of them have been updated. I saw recently Alexander updated the Sutta channel. So there's some suttas you can go read. There's also been some cool little things going on with some sort of Dhammarato books. I've read a bit of that, but not sure what all is going on there. But yeah, there's plenty to read, plenty to play around with, and plenty of friends to make. So come make some friends. And there's also been people recently asking about, hey, how do I find a wat? How do I find a real life Sangha? As if this isn't good enough. Well, the answer to that is you can go to opensanghafoundation.org and there's a Sangha map that you can check out. It doesn't have every wat, but you can find quite a few there. And if you're still not able to find one, feel free to reach out to me and We'll see if we can find a wat near you. So yeah, thank you, friends. Take it easy.

**Speaker A:** Take care. Yeah, go ask you also on the website. We have a search page where you can search by city or state and find all the wats that we know of there. All right, well, thank you all for coming. This has been a delightful time. I enjoy talking to you. I'm expecting some feedback about counterfeit Dharma, so if you have some bone to pick or want to compete with me on anything, I'm ready. I'm happy. We'll see you. All right, thank you all.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Dhammarato.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha:

### **Core Theme: Identifying the "Real" Dhamma vs. "Counterfeit" Dhamma**
The talk focuses on distinguishing the Buddha's original, simple, and effective teachings from later complex, diluted, or mixed-in traditions that are called "Buddhism."

### **Main Points:**

1.  **The Real Dhamma (The Buddha's Core Teaching):**
    *   **Immediate & Accessible:** It is "sanditiko" (visible here and now), "akaliko" (timeless, giving immediate results), and "ehipassiko" (inviting one to "come and see" for oneself).
    *   **The Path to End Dukkha:** The practice of the **Noble Eightfold Path** leads to the end of suffering (*dukkha*) **right now**, in this moment. The skill is in continuously applying it.
    *   **Goal is Skillfulness, Not Perfection:** An Arahant (or the Buddha) is not someone who never has an unwholesome thought. They are someone who **sees and abandons unwholesome thoughts immediately**, not letting them develop into "storytelling" that causes suffering. The goal is happiness and freedom *now*, not a distant, perfect state.
    *   **Central Practice:** Watching the mind to catch selfish, unwholesome thoughts (greed, ill-will, ignorance) and the "storyteller" that creates dukkha, returning to a happy, peaceful state.

2.  **The Counterfeit Dhamma:**
    *   **What it is:** Teachings that are complicated, difficult, slow, and mixed with elements from other religions or cultures (e.g., Tibetan culture, Thai animism, Hindu concepts). They obscure the simple, immediate path.
    *   **Examples Given:**
        *   The **Visuddhimagga** (a later commentary) and its complex systems like the "16 stages of insight," which can lead to a "dark night of the soul"—contrary to the Dhamma being "good in the beginning, middle, and end."
        *   The **10 Fetters Model:** Dhammarato argues the traditional 10 fetters are an over-complication. He reduces them to four core issues: personality view, attachment to rules/rituals, doubt about the path, and the paired greed/ill-will. He specifically labels the intermediate stages of enlightenment (*Sakadagami*, *Anagami*) and the "higher fetters" as later, counterfeit additions that slow progress.
        *   The **Pāramīs** (perfections) are presented as another example of a long, arduous path that contradicts the immediacy of the core Dhamma.
    *   **Result:** Counterfeit Dhamma makes practice hard, delays results, and focuses on ideals and perfection rather than present-moment happiness and skillfulness.

3.  **Key Sutta Reference:**
    *   **SN 16.13 - The Counterfeit of the True Dhamma** was read. It warns that the true Dhamma declines when a counterfeit version arises, caused by a lack of respect for the Teacher, Dhamma, Sangha, Training, and Mental Composure.

4.  **Practical Application & Warnings:**
    *   **Beware of Dogmatism:** Getting attached to certain words (e.g., deeming words like "shit" as "unskillful") or rules is itself a fetter (clinging to rites and rituals) and a form of selfish comparison (*māna*).
    *   **Use of "Harsh" Language:** Sometimes, direct or "low-class" language (as used by teachers like Buddhadasa) is an *upaya* (skillful means) to shake people out of complacency and intellectualism.
    *   **The Simple Test:** If a teaching or practice is not leading to a decrease in suffering and an increase in happiness **right now**, it is likely not the true Dhamma.

### **Conclusion from the Talk:**
The Buddha's teaching is profoundly simple: develop the skill to see the mind's unwholesome storytelling (rooted in selfishness) and drop it, returning to peace and happiness in the present moment. The vast, complex edifice of "Buddhism" is largely filled with counterfeit Dhamma that distracts from this immediate, practical path. The real practice is about freedom from suffering now, not in lifetimes to come.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the talk uses several core metaphors and references a few key stories to illustrate its points about "counterfeit" vs. "true" Dhamma.

### **Primary Metaphors:**

1.  **Counterfeit vs. Genuine Goods:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Counterfeit Gold & Native Gold:** Directly from the sutta (SN 16.13) read by Speaker B. Counterfeit Dhamma devalues and obscures the true Dhamma, just as fake gold drives out the real thing.
    *   **Counterfeit Money:** Speaker A extends the metaphor, using the example of North Korean counterfeit bills to argue that while counterfeits harm the market, they don't completely destroy the original (the US dollar).
    *   **Counterfeit (Lab-Grown) vs. Natural Diamonds:** Used to show that counterfeits can severely devalue the perceived worth of the original, making it less accessible or desirable.

2.  **The House Builder:** A classic Buddhist metaphor (from the Dhammapada) for the mind's tendency to construct suffering ("build a house") through craving and unwholesome thoughts. The Arahant's skill is to catch the "house builder" (the unwholesome impulse) before any construction begins. *"He doesn't let the house builder actually build the house."*

3.  **Path/Journey Metaphors:** The talk contrasts two types of paths:
    *   **The Easy, Immediate Path:** The true Dhamma is a clear, accessible path with visible results *here and now*.
    *   **The Difficult, Long Path:** Counterfeit Dhamma is portrayed as a complicated, arduous road that takes "lifetimes and lifetimes," delaying liberation.

4.  **The Storyteller:** A modern, colloquial version of the "house builder" metaphor. Unwholesome thoughts are "making up stories." The practice is to recognize *"aha, I see you storytelling"* and stop the narrative before it causes suffering.

5.  **Medical/Health Metaphor:** The Dhamma is presented as a direct remedy. Counterfeit Dhamma is like an ineffective or wrong treatment that doesn't provide the "immediate benefits" of the real medicine.

6.  **Two Sides of the Same Coin:** Used to describe greed and ill-will (aversion). They are not separate fetters to be worked on sequentially, but interconnected aspects of the same reactive mechanism.

### **Stories and Literary References:**

1.  **The Sutta of the Counterfeit Dhamma (SN 16.13):** The core story read aloud. It provides the scriptural authority for the entire talk, using the counterfeit gold analogy and listing the causes for the decline of the true teaching.

2.  **The Buddha and Unwholesome Thoughts:** Speaker A references a personal finding (claiming over 20 suttas) that the Buddha and Arahants still had fleeting unwholesome thoughts but eradicated them immediately. This story challenges the "perfection" ideal and supports the "house builder" metaphor.

3.  **The Dog-Duty Ascetic (likely a reference to MN 57):** This story is summarized to make a point about action (*kamma*). The Buddha tells an ascetic who imitates a dog that such action leads only to a dog's fate. The speaker uses it to introduce the "fourth kind of kamma"—action that leads to the end of action (restlessness).

4.  **Shakespeare's *Hamlet*:** Referenced to explain the fetter of *arupa-raga* (lust for the formless). The talk reinterprets this not as desire for formless jhanas, but as the existential conflict captured in Hamlet's soliloquy: *"To be or not to be."* It's linked to the primal "death wish" or desire to escape existence when suffering arises.

5.  **Anecdote about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:** A brief story about the Thai teacher using low-class language (like the selfish word *"goo"*) to shock people and teach Dhamma. This illustrates the point that attachment to "proper" words is a fetter, and skillful means (*upaya*) can use unconventional methods.

6.  **Personal Anecdote from Speaker E (Ivan):** He shares how he was initially upset when Speaker A told him he "made that shit up" about a problem, but upon practicing the simple advice, he got benefits. This serves as a modern testimonial story for the efficacy of the "simple" Dhamma.

### **Summary of Contrasts Built by the Metaphors:**
The talk consistently uses these metaphors to build a stark contrast between what it frames as two opposing systems:

| **Metaphor For True Dhamma** | **Metaphor For Counterfeit Dhamma** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Native, pure gold | Counterfeit gold |
| An easy, visible path | A difficult, long road |
| Immediate medicine | Ineffective treatment |
| Stopping the house builder/storyteller | Letting stories build and suffering result |
| Simple, accessible, here-and-now | Complicated, esoteric, delayed |

The core argument, illustrated through these metaphors and stories, is that mainstream "Buddhism" (especially texts like the *Visuddhimagga* and concepts like the *paramis*, elaborate jhanas, and intermediate stages of enlightenment) is a "counterfeit" that obscures the Buddha's simple, immediate, and liberating core teaching.
