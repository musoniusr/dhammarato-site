### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so guys, welcome to the Sunday afternoon call from Thailand on the UK. So most of the folks that are on the call are not in the States because it's the middle of the night in the United States, but it's in the morning in Europe. So Welcome to the call. Wow, we've got quite a crowd today. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 people. That's great. So the first thing that we would like to talk about would be the fact that the suttas have been messed with over the past 2,500 years. In fact, they were being messed with right in the time of the Buddha. Now, how does that happen? It happens because the people who were doing it do not have a pure mind, and so they add their own stuff to it, their thoughts. What they think is correct is going to get influenced. One of the ways that I would talk about it is imagine that there is a shrine somewhere off in the wilderness, down in the woods, a small place, that's got a small door and that you can get into this place if you drop all of your baggage. But you have to drop your baggage. You can't take a backpack in it. There's no room for a backpack in there. Okay. Now imagine that that little small place in the woods has been there for 2,500 years with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of people making their way there. And entering that small place, leaving all their baggage outside. Which means that the entire hillside is covered with other people's baggage. And most of the Westerners are confused what's the baggage and what's the building that we're entering, because you've got to climb over an awful lot of baggage. Then in fact, one of the big points then that you could say is, is that there's a whole lot of Western teachers now who claim that they're inside the room, where in fact they're still out there with the baggage, and they're still carrying their own baggage. So this is the metaphor that we would use to understand that the, their, the suttas have been changed. Another point which we'll cover in detail in a little while is, is that there's another point about the suttas, and that is, is that it's for a wide audience, that some of the stuff applies to some students, other stuff applies to other students, and then there's some stuff in there that applies to only a few students. And yet the way that the Western mind works, we want knowledge, we thirst for knowledge, we want to know step 1, step 2, and step 3. And then we, many of us also, I don't want to know about step 1, I don't want to know about step 2, I only want to know the bottom line. Right. And so when they practice that way, they become confused that in fact there is a progression. You could almost say that there are 4 stages, and the first stage is a major step up. And so in order to make that major step up, you could then say that a whole lot of the suttas are about making that first step. And that first step then would be considered What? What is that first step? Michael, what is that first step if there are four? Remember to wake up. No, we're talking about it in, in stages. And in this case, what I'm talking about is the Srotapanna. Yeah, the stream, right? Yes. Right, okay, and so most people are not in Stream Entry. In fact, very, very few make it to Stream Entry, and then fewer still make it into the higher stages. But I will say this, that Stream Entry is good enough. Stream Entry is considered noble. But one of the qualities of Stream Entry is that the student becomes absolutely dedicated, enthrall, absolutely eager, absolutely— what would be the word— enthusiastic. And when the full Sotapanna comes, the student is delighted, and he doesn't see anything else. Everywhere he looks, all he sees is Dharma, Dharma, Dharma everywhere, and we can drink it in. That's the way of looking at it, that your whole life is around Dharma. Nothing else matters. And so this is the state of Srotapanna. This is basically why it's called entering the stream, is because you're entering the flow of the Dharma rather than putting a toe in. That in fact that's the only way to go, is first you got to get to the stream, you got to start hearing about the Dharma, and then you put a toe in. That's the beginning of practice. And then maybe you put your ankle in, and then you get out, and then you put your toe back in, and then you get out and put your ankle in again, and then you come out again, over and over and over again. But fairly soon If you keep practicing, you get good results. That's an important thing that in fact I can tell that a huge number of people practice what they consider meditation, and they want something, and they want something, and so they keep dedicating to practicing, but they're not getting any much benefit out of it other than the pride of how long they've been practicing. And so they will claim to be a Srotapanna, to where in fact they're not. In fact, the one thing that you can say about a Srotapanna is that the only person who knows he's a Srotapanna because he talks to him is, let us say, a master teacher. That if you think that you have arrived at Srotapanna, guess what? If the teacher that you have is a good teacher, he already knows that. And one of the points about being a Srotapanna is that people do get in the stream and then get back right out again, and then they get in it again, and then they'll float for a while, and then they'll get out again. Okay, that I talk about this often, and the phrase that I use is sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Sometimes you're in the stream and sometimes you're not. Sometimes when you're in the stream, you're drowning, and then you get back off of the shore, "Wow, what a relief it is, I got out of that!" And then, eventually, we get in the stream and we learn how to swim, and we paddle around, and we go all over the Suttas. And then, the best then would be is when you learn to be in the stream and float on your back. And just let the stream do all the work. No place to go, nothing to do. And so this whole point about entering the stream is, let us say, a progression kind of thing, but it's always whether you're in the stream or not, whether you're in the Dhamma right this moment or whether you're not, whether you're in hindrances right now or whether you're not. Now when you start to develop getting out of the hindrances and getting into the flow, that's development of skill. And so sometimes you're in it and sometimes you're not. And when you're not in it, you're just practicing all the old stuff that you always knew. However, when you're in the stream, when you enter the stream, that's the same thing as developing the skills. This is why the Anapanasati Sutta, among many other places the Buddha talks about, thus one trains oneself. You train yourself to enter into Sukkha, and then you train the mind to be able to sustain that Sukkha. And when you can sustain it over and over and over and over and over again, that's like actually putting a toe in. And then when you get the attitude, I belong here, I belong in the stream, there ain't no place else for me. Then that's the next phase of Anapanasati. That would be what they call Piti. So you have the Piti Sukkha. The Sukkha is, I can't get in. And the Piti is, this is where I live. This is mine now. Not in a selfish way, but in the sense that you've got a belonging. This is where you belong. You belong in the stream. There's no place else for you. You don't want to be out in the world anymore. An example of that would be, I've had on several different occasions, in fact, once when I was a monk and also online, when I was a monk, a policeman came and he asked me about the Dharma. And I says, "It depends, you know, if you want a little bit, then you can study a little bit and still be a policeman. But if you want to go into the Dharma and get some real value out of it, Go quit that job. Why? Because if you stay a cop, you're staying in Dukkha. That's what a cop's job is all about, is to cause people trouble. They call it service. What are they servicing? Well, they're servicing the people by arresting. A judge does. That when a judge on the bench puts down a verdict, what he's doing, he's dividing up those who's going to get a little bit of Dukkha and those who are going to get a lot. And that's what a cop does. When a cop intervenes in any situation, he's there to make sure that somebody's going to get arrested, somebody's going to get Dukkha, somebody's going to get a ticket. Somebody's going to get hurt. So if you want to be in the Dharma, you have to come to the point of, "Hey, I'm not going to stay on that kind of side. I'm going to enter the stream. I'm going to be in the sense of finding a way of reducing Dukkha, not causing more of it." So, what has happened over so many centuries is all of these cops, all these policemen, all these would-be's, all these meditators, all these Western Dharma teachers and all the old ones from the past 25 years, 2,500 years, have wanted the Dharma, love the Dharma, but are not really able to enter the stream and paddle around and then lay on their back and relax. So we have had a whole lot of people messing with the Dharma for 2,500 years. One of the little stories about this, by the way, is that Ananda, who was basically— he was a cousin or very close to the Buddha. He was actually raised as his brother. And after Ananda completed his administrator's duties, he came to live with the Buddha. And spent the last 25 years. For the first 20 years, he was not around, and there's a lot of suttas and a lot of information that we have where Ananda was not around. But for the past 25 years of the Buddha's life, one of the deals that they made when Ananda came, he says there's 3 things that I want. One of them is that you cannot send me away. And so the Buddha honored that. And that was basically the downfall for Ananda, was that he was always around the Buddha, which meant that he kept his beliefs. And that he would have been better off if he had gotten Mahamagga or Shariputra or something to crack him over the head, because the Buddha didn't because of their friendship. And so when the Buddha died, Mahamoggala, Mahakaccana, and a few of them that were still left—Sariputta had already died by then—they decided to have a conference where they were going to put their heads together and make sure that they understood the actual full-range teachings of the Buddha. And guess what? Ananda was not invited to that conference. They didn't want him in there. Why? Because he was still an ordinary person, which meant that a lot of the stuff that he had seen and been around, he had been already making stuff up. Well, What happened was, is that when they wouldn't let him into the final conference, he understood what the Buddha had been trying to tell him all along, that he didn't get it. There's one of the suttas where Ananda comes and says that he understands Paticcasamuppada, and the Buddha chastises him in the way that says the teachings of dependent origination are pound. They're difficult to understand. But he didn't tell Ananda right then and there, and guess what, Goode, you ain't got it. He didn't say it that way. And, uh, Mahamoggala did though. After the Buddha died, he told Ananda, hey man, you, you ain't got it. You got to go figure it out. And the, uh, the story is, is that just before the conference started Ananda woke up. He had been able to put the past 25 years of the teachings of the Buddha in place to throw out all of his hindrances, and he made very quick succession, and he was able to get it. And because of that, he was allowed into the conference. And guess what? While he was then in the conference— that conference started about 3 months after the Buddha died, and it lasted for about a year. And by and large, Ananda was the star of the show. Why? Because he had been around the Buddha so much. But still, right from the very beginning, Amit, right from the very beginning, the suttas were polluted by the star of the show, Ananda. And this is why the Majjhima Nikaya is worded the kind of the way that it is. Now there's another point. In fact, I just had a talk with Daniel about Sutta number 54, and in that sutta, a layman comes to discuss with the Buddha, and what he says was that he has renounced, he's living the life of a monk. That he has given away all of his attachments. And the Buddha pointed out that, no, that's not true. You're still wearing fancy clothes. You've got a parasol, you've got fancy sandals. Even though you've given up your inheritance to your children already, you're still acting like a layman. And so that's what he called him. He called him a householder, and it pissed the guy off. So That was also what happened with Ananda. But in this one particular sutta, the Buddha sounds like that he is teaching rebirth and reincarnation to where in fact what happened with the Buddha, that he was in the state of pacing and then leading. In other words, because he hadn't convinced the guy yet, He was willing to talk in the language that this layman understood because the layman already believed in rebirth and reincarnation. And because he believed in it already, the Buddha communicated that way to him. But when the Buddha gets to the higher stages, that's when the students are warned that you do not want to be reborn. It's not a matter of you have no choice. Of course you've got a choice, and you make the statement and you make the choice. You're not coming back. Basically, what that's the knowledge of is that there's nothing to it. It's just a bunch of stories. A modern example of that is the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama, I don't remember when it was. It was probably about 20 years ago, because 25 or 30 years ago, The Panchen Lama, which was some kid that they went through the Toku system and he was, you know, the reincarnated whoop-de-doo. And the Chinese government grabbed that kid and took him to China and put up their own Panchen Lama instead. And the Dalai Lama knew that that was exactly what the Chinese were going to do with him. And so he made a great big announcement. He's not coming back. Which basically will destroy the Tulku system of Tibet. Now the whole point is, is that the Dalai Lama is noble and he already knows he's not coming back, but the belief system of all the people around is, is that he is coming back, that they all believe that kind of stuff. However, belief in magical powers, belief in rebirth and reincarnation, is something, is baggage that almost everybody has. And the reason that we all have that is twofold. One is that we're taught that. Christians are taught about heavens and hells and purgatories. And all of Asians are taught about heavens and hells and animal worlds and things like that. Animal, ghostly worlds and all of that. In fact, the Thai people in general are very, very big into ghosts. You'd see a lot of their movies are horror movies. To where they've got bouncing ghosts, just like in the West. They have a lot of horror movies. They've got devils and they've got ghosts and they've got dead things, you know. Well, guess what? The kids will go to see those movies because they at least half believe that there are ghosts, there are devils. We've taught— we're taught that in our society. I mean, is there anybody here who hasn't heard of devils and ghosts? Is anybody here? I mean, everybody's heard— not just heard about it, you've been trained with that data. And so everybody comes to the teaching of the Buddha believing some of that stuff. Even atheists, when they say there is no God, what they're really saying is, is that I don't want it. But the point is, is that when we believe things, it's hard to get rid of because in fact the other side that I was going to mention is that it's built into our DNA. We have instincts, instinctual behavior, and the instinct that's primarily involved with this is the self-preservation instinct. And dying and being dead for sure goes against our instinct. We want to live forever. We want to live on and on and on. No matter how old you are, everybody wants just one more breath, one more minute, one more day, one more year. And if you can't get it, then at least one more lifetime, or maybe over and over and over again. So we've got both of these things. One is just built into our DNA, the self-preservation instinct to preserve our life, and then we get a whole ton of it from all the other people who believe in all of that stuff. So when we get to that point, we're going to bring all of those kind of beliefs with us to the Dhamma. And all of that business stays hanging around, and it becomes actually part of Buddhism. Let's see, who is that? Somebody's got their hand up, and I can't tell. Like, yeah, Ross. Ross, okay, go ahead, go ahead, Ross.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, um, but in terms of the Buddha, did Wasn't the path of the Buddha— it wasn't his aim to find the cure for death? No.

**Speaker A:** No. His whole point was to find the cure for Dukkha. And what is Dukkha? It's best defined as dissatisfaction. The reason why people want another life, by the way, is because this one's not good enough. They want a do-over. How many times have you heard about people going and making merits so that they can have a pure land to go to, so that then they can practice easy? And rather than in this very life— it's pure enough. Practice right now. Come out of all of your beliefs and all of your craps. When is your last life going to be your last life? Because that's the point of it. The Buddha don't come back. The Dalai Lama not coming back. If you're not coming back after the next 20,000 lifetimes, does that mean that there are 19,999 lifetimes when you finally figure out that you're not coming back, and so there's no reason to want to? Or can you do that in this life? Maybe this one is the $18,999 in life, and you can do it now. Okay, but all of this comes back to that question of where did all of that crap in the suttas come from? But you can also say that the same thing exactly happened to the Bible. How much of the stuff gets screwed up because of translations and They want to take this book because they like it, and they don't want that Apocrypha because they don't like it. And so they kind of manufacture the Bible. They say that it's the word of God, but how many gods have had their fingers in all of those words? And that's the same thing that's happened with this, the suttas. So Anicca, Now that we know that the suttas are highly polluted, what do we do about it? The answer to that is that we begin to understand what the teachings of the Buddha really is, and then we know what to do with the crap when we find it. Basically, that's what my job is, is to help my friends to understand how to understand the suttas. And that is, you got to get picky. You got to read the suttas with wisdom, just like we got to deal with the world. There's a lot of good stuff in the world, but a lot of crap's out there too. How do you tell the difference? Is with discernment. You have to have wisdom. You have to be able to see things clearly. And that's also true with our thoughts. We have to start seeing our thoughts clearly. When we start seeing our thoughts clearly, we begin to recognize that, hey, I'm making this stuff up. It's not real. It's what I want. So that happens on a lot of occasions. Let's say that the automobile mechanic is trying to fix his car, but it's in the middle 1950s and car parts are hard to come by in rural South Carolina. So we make stuff up and we put that, that made-up part in our car. They do that a lot in India, by the way, and they've gotten fairly good at it. But they're not putting original parts in, they're putting parts in that they think will work, because they're making them up. We call it shade-tree mechanic, or fixing our car with baling wire and barbed wire, sometimes even some bubble gum. To try to fix the car, to get it going. Okay, so that's how we've been living our lives. We're not using original parts, we're making stuff up on our own. And like I said, this happened right from the very beginning. However, there are some places that we can go to. There is a couple of works. One is called the Sutta Nipata Upadana, and the other one is called the Udana. And in these works, it's fairly well understood that these were written by monks who knew what they were talking about, and they wrote these things down before the Buddha died. That this is actually stuff that happened during the lifetime of the Buddha, and that many of the suttas that you'll find in especially the Dhammanakkaya, but also even in the Mahayana, actually is based upon And a great deal of the Dhammapada is based upon the Sutta Nipata and the Udana. And so if you really want to know what the teachings were like before all of the stuff that was added to, the way to go is back to the Udana and the Sutta Nipata, because they're probably the purest things that have not been messed with. But you can all see the magic and the rebirth and reincarnation stuff that is still in the Majjhima Nikaya. But if you know how to read the Majjhima Nikaya, you can just see that stuff and understand what it is. I'll give you an example of that. In fact, the best example is to talk about the Piti Samuppada, because that's one of the main things that the Buddha did right after he went to Bodh Gaya on his own, part of his waking up process was to figure out exactly how the mind worked. And yet, if you read about the Paticcasamuppada coming out of works like the Visuddhimagga that were done 2,500 years later, it winds up getting it really screwed up. They divide the Paticcasamuppada into 3 lifetimes. The lifetimes of the past, the lifetimes to the present, and then the lifetimes of the future. Well, guess what? That's actually correct, except that the lifetimes in the past were something that happened 10 minutes ago, 5 minutes ago, 5 years ago. It happened when you were a kid. That's one, that's the past. And then you've got this present moment And then your next life is what's going to happen next week, next month, next year. You have 3 lifetimes right here, right now. You have your past lives, you have the present life, and you have the future lives. And you don't have to do it with the breakup of the body and all of that kind of stuff. That's just magical thinking. Another one is, is that people really like magic. That in fact rebirth and reincarnation are magical stories. How about flying through the air? How about having a fire come out of your finger? How about risen from the dead? How about babies born without sex? How about sky daddies with binoculars watching what you're doing? All of this is just magical thinking, and all religions are based upon it. Even the Buddhist religion is based upon a lot of magical thinking. Now, here's a question for you: does someone who has magical thinking, can they actually practice the teachings of the Buddha and get out of it, out of their magical beliefs, and get value from the Dharma right here in this life? The answer to that is yes, but the sooner you come out of your magical beliefs, the easier your practice will be. That I even know monks here in Thailand that are very, very good monks. They do everything that you would expect a monk to do, but if you get him in a corner, he'll talk about, oh well, this lifetime is not good enough, I'm going to be better in my next life, that what I'm doing in this life is getting ready for my next life, when there, that's when I'm going to actually do it. And so in fact, even some very good monks in Thailand are postponing going into that stream, because they still believe in rebirth and reincarnation. However, he has made enormous progress. In the sense that he is able to remove most of the defilements, but he is clinging to some defilements because he still wants to be reborn so that he can postpone getting rid of the defilements in this lifetime, keep them around for a while, get another life, and then I'll finish the job. The reality is you can finish the job this afternoon. You can finish the job tomorrow. You don't have to wait for the next life. And so this is a major problem. This is one of the reasons, in fact, you could say that this is the primary reason why there are so few nobles in the world, is because everyone says, well, let me hang out on the beach for a while before I have to go surfing. 'Let me hang out on the beach for this life. I'll wait until the future life when the waves are just right.' And we do that. You do that in this life a lot. And so that magical thinking actually prevents people from making real progress. But if you have the attitude, 'Hey man, this is it.' I'm going to do it now. Why? Because if I do it now, I won't have to suffer for the rest of this life and a few more— 19,998 lives. I can stop my suffering right now. If it starts up again, I'll stop it again. That's the kind of attitude. That's the attitude that you have that would be considered noble. It doesn't mean that you are completely free of the defilements. What it means is, is that you're on watch, and when you catch one you squash it. That's the way to go. All right, so in this process that we've been talking about, we also recognize that there are certain stages along the way. We've talked about it in the metaphor of hanging out on the beach where all the bugs and all the ticks and all the heat is, but at least we're comfortable enough that we don't jump in. And then we have those that are jumping in and drowning, and then you have those that are jumping in and learning to swim, and then you're working with those who become a master at riding that surfboard, or maybe just floating on their back. But all of that has skills to be developed. So one point then, that was mentioned, is, "Well, what about thoughts?" That some monks will say, "Oh, you've got to be able to get rid of the thoughts." Well, nobody can do that from the beginning. That's not possible. You've got no skill. So the first skill that we have to gain is the ability to control our thoughts. And the way that we develop the skill of being able to control our thoughts is learning to control this and then for a while we don't control the thoughts, and then we get a hot dog, I can do it now, and control this one again. And the more often you're learning to control a thought, the more skills you have in being able to control the thoughts. And when you get very good at being able to control the thoughts— and what I mean by controlling the thoughts, by the way, is being free from Dukkha, to be free from the hindrances, to be free from unwholesome thoughts And a lot of people have demonstrated that they are coming there, and then they'll have an unwholesome thought, and they don't know that it's an unwholesome thought. And so this is part of the training, is to be able to recognize Dukkha when you see it, or to be able to recognize Sukkha because you're looking for it in that way. And so we will have a wholesome thought, and then an unwholesome thought will happen. And when we see that an unwholesome thought, we'll say, oh no, I've had an unwholesome thought, oh poor me. And now Now you're having a whole bunch of unwholesome thoughts. How do you handle an unwholesome thought is, "Aha, I see you, Mr. Unwholesome Thought. Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I'm playing a game here and I'm winning that game. I see you." This is how we learn to control the thoughts. And once we learn to control the thoughts, then we can start setting them aside. But only after you learn to control them. And in fact, the whole point of learning to control the thought is the first Jhana. Now, the Buddha actually came to the station of recognizing that in fact enlightenment is the first Jhana. You don't really ever have to get rid of your thoughts altogether in order to be enlightened. All you need to do is just have some nice, happy, wholesome thoughts most of the time. Like the preponderance of the time, a great deal of the time, you just keep coming back and having happy thoughts. Then you stub your toe and you laugh. Oh, I stuck my toe. No big problem. There's a story about that, by the way, and that is, is that imagine that there are two groups of teenagers, a group of teenagers in the West and a group of teenagers in Thailand. And imagine that both groups of teenagers are going down the road, and in one group, in fact in both groups, somebody slips and falls down. Now, what happens in the West if you've got a bunch of teenagers walking along and one of them slips and falls down? Amrit, what happens when one of the kids falls down? Everybody laughs. Well, that's a whole lot more Asian than it is Western. No, the Westerners is going to be divided into two groups. One is going to be the bullies that laugh away that a bully would, and the other one is those, oh please, let me help you. Oh, you're injured. Oh, let me help you get up. It's more in Thailand is when the kid falls down Everybody laughs. Guess what? Who laughs even the most? It's the kid who falls down. But in the West, when a kid falls down and his other friends are there, oh, he wants to be picked up. Oh, poor me, I've fallen down. I need help. Okay, so this is actually a change of our attitudes. And the culture of Thailand has a better attitude in general than the culture in the West. The culture in the West sees trouble when some event happens, like a kid falls down. There's nothing wrong with a kid falling down. Every kid that I know of have ever fallen down. Does anybody here ever not fallen down their whole life? No, everybody falls down. Can you just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and just boogie on down the road? Or do you have to lay there face down in the mud saying, "Oh, poor me. Oh, I need an ambulance. Oh, I need help." So this is the way that we were raised. And so when we have those kind of thoughts that we can say, then an unwholesome thought is a kind of falling down. When you see that falling down kind of thought, can you just pick yourself up? Aha, I see you fell down. Aha, I see you, unwholesome thought. Pick yourself up and boogie on down the highway. That's the way to live. And that would be the first Jhana. You don't have to sit down and contemplate it.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker A:** Yet, when someone is actually able— let us continue with that analogy and go in a kind of a different direction, because this would be something that's more— let us say an advanced position, that whenever you see somebody falling down, you can recollect, "Oh, well, I've fallen down too. I know what falling down is all about, and I know when I fall down, I feel bad. Look, those people have fallen down." So I can reflect upon the fact that when I did fall down, I felt bad. But now, if I fall down, I can feel good. This is what the senior monks— this is in fact Samatha was the one, Ajahn Samatha was the one who's the most famous for talking about recollection, to recollect what's happened in your life. Now, most people, when they recollect in their life, it's like, oh, well, I fell down. I remember that falling down. Boy, it hurt. And I didn't like it. And then I fell down again and I didn't like it then either. Okay, this is what an ordinary person does, and for those people I would recommend don't recollect the past, because if you recollect the past, you're going to wind up bringing the old Dukkha right here, right now. But an advanced student can recollect, oh, I fell down, and say, ha, I remember I fell down. Boy, what a scene it was. I was in such a pity party. But now I'm not. So this is what we would mean then by recollection, is can you recollect the past and get a big kick out of it, even knowing that at the time that it happened you didn't like it so much? But now we can reflect, oh, look how much I have changed, because in the old days when I fell down, I felt bad. I wallowed in the mud for hours. I had a pity party for 19 days in a row. I got drunk. I went to gamble. I went to watch the porn. Oh, I felt so bad. But now, now I've come so far along in the Dharma that I can remember that when I fell down, that I got drunk, or that I went to porn, or that I went to gambling, or whatever. And we can say, "Hot dog, I don't have to do that stuff anymore." "Hot dog, I can see that I was in Mara, but now I'm not." So I can congratulate myself and pat myself on the back and say, "Hey, I don't fall down like that anymore." This is why it's such a good idea to reflect, because then you begin to understand that when you see out in the public, you see somebody fall down, you don't go with compassion and say, "Oh, poor you." 'Oh, let me help you.' No, what you do is in fact you laugh. You say, 'Hey, you make me get back up. You don't have to be there. Come, let's have some sympathetic joy together.' This is what Metta and Karuna and Mudita are all about, is to invite people out of their pity party into joy. But you can't help somebody come out of their pity party into joy when you're more than likely going to join them in their pity party. No, you got to have your mind actually pretty cleaned out. And when your mind is clean and clear and pure and you see somebody else suffering, you help them out of it. Maybe you have to point out to them, look, you have fallen down. No, I haven't fallen down. No, I'm okay. No, I'm not angry. No, I'm not having suffering. Well, if you don't know you've fallen down, then you're going to be laying there face down in the mud and you don't even know it. And so it takes a good skilled Dhamma dude to come by and sort of point out that you got mud all over your face. Why don't you get up? Why do you— and an example of that is, hey, you're arguing with me instead of listening to what I'm saying. This happens on every first call, by the way. Everybody who calls me the first time argues with me. It happens every time, doesn't it, Ivan? This is why it's a good idea to have a good Dharma friend who knows, because he's going to point out, hey, you're lying in the mud there. Why don't you pick yourself up and dust yourself off and have a minute of joy? And so that's part of the job that we have as a good friend, is when people call the first time, is to point that out. And then by the end of the conversation, they're laughing and joking and like the fact that they have been shown that they have been screwing up right here on the call. In other words, we are in Dukkha and we're ignorant. Of being in Dukkha. We don't know it. We don't know that we're in the ditch. We don't know that we're lying face down in the mud. And so we keep telling ourselves mud is sweet. We like to argue. We like to fuss and to fight. It makes us feel strong. And the point is that we can in fact make a big change. And that big change is first off to see that we're face down in the mud with these thoughts, and then we can pick ourselves up. Aha, I see that I'm laying in the mud. Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see you, unwholesome thought. And by having that kind of attitude, it's actually quite easy to get up. But if you have the attitude, oh, he's right, I am face down in the mud, oh poor me, then you'll stay in the mud. So you have to have somebody to come along, not kick you in the ass, but to point out happily and joyfully that you're full of crap. Get up! So, we can begin then to control our thoughts so that we don't have these kinds of thoughts anymore. And there may come a time when we are so good at controlling our thoughts that we can begin to put some gaps in it, that we have a wholesome thought and a wholesome thought and a wholesome thought. But most people will have a wholesome thought and then 3 or 4 unwholesome thoughts, and then a wholesome thought and then 2 or 3 more unwholesome thoughts. That's the way that the beginners are. For the normal people out there, it's unwholesome thought thousands in a row, and then they'll have one wholesome thought followed followed by another 1,000 thoughts of unhappiness. But when we begin to practice, we can get it down to about maybe 25% of our thoughts are wholesome, about 75% are unwholesome. But when we can get it to where we can go wholesome thought, wholesome thought, wholesome thought, wholesome thought, then we can put a gap between this wholesome thought and the next wholesome thought. Now normally for the beginners, when they put a gap between the thoughts, the next thought that comes up is going to be an unwholesome thought, something like, oh, look at me, I was thoughtless for a minute, but now the thoughts have started back up and I don't like that. Instead of saying, hot dog, the thoughts have started back up again, and I see that, so that we can begin to have wholesome thought, wholesome thought, nothing. And then another wholesome thought, and then another wholesome thought, and then nothing. And begin to put some gaps in those thoughts, and pretty soon the gaps can grow so that there's a whole lot of nothing interspersed between wholesome thoughts. This would be the kind of progress that an advanced student would make. This would be, in fact, the state that I would say then would be the Srotapanna, to where the Srotapanna is the one who knows that this is an unwholesome thought and can do something about it; to where the Srotapanna is the one who can have wholesome thought, wholesome thought, and then a gap, and very rarely does he have unwholesome thoughts, and when they do, he can see those. He can come right back out of it. And so this is the kind of progress. And for that reason, there are teachings for more advanced students. And so we actually, because we have a group of people, we have to begin to mix those beginners' things and the more advanced things kind of together. Because people will be at various points in time. Then in fact, when I say people at various points in time, back again, sometimes you're an advanced student and sometimes you're a beginner. Sometimes you're getting quite good at it, and then you're no good at all. Achan Po, by the way, was very good at pointing out to me when I was in Srotapanna and when I was not. And he would make that point, that it's not an all-or-nothing. And yet in Western mentality, they think that, oh, I've had a big experience, and I go talk to my teacher who's had big experiences, and he says I'm a Sotapanna, so I must be a Sotapanna. And then I go all over the place advertising that I'm a Sotapanna, where in fact, a lot of the time you're back out of it again. We go in and out, and in and out, and in and out, and in and out. And so when we're practicing correctly, we get back into it, and then we fall out, and then we get back into it again. So, Amrit, you've had your hand up for quite a while. Please.

**Speaker D:** Yes, I have two questions. So the first one is about For instance, when I'm taking a long, long breath in and I'm feeling the breath kind of moving through my body and I'm calming my body, so this is also you would consider a thought? Because this is also like manufactured, right?

**Speaker A:** I would say that we should have a way of defining the word thought. So let's do that. Because everybody generally, when they say the word thought, what they're actually meaning is a certain kind of thought called discursive thought, where there's actually words involved. But there are many, many kinds of thoughts that have no words to them. An example of when you stub your toe, how many words are you going to use? Maybe one. Ouch! But what we're going to do instead with our mind is we're going to, let us say, think about the fact that the toe hurts. And so when we're experiencing pain, that's the kind of a thought, but it's got no words to it. When you see a pretty girl out there on the street, you just look at her. That's not a thought. And in fact, the thought of, oh, she's a pretty girl, means I'm not looking at her anymore. I'm thinking about looking at her, but I'm not looking at her. I'm thinking. Okay, so we can now begin to understand that we can better define the word thought by how we spend a mind moment. Are we going to spend our mind moments in sensory input of the eyes, the ears, the touch, the taste, the smell? Are we going to spend our mind moments thinking about sight, sound, touch, taste, smell. But in fact, for humans, the smell seems to be the weakest one of all. For instance, how many of you can accurately describe what the smell of a rose is, other than using the word rose? Do you actually— can you remember and recollect what a rose smells like? And that smell that you remember is exactly the kind of way that a rose would smell if you had one under your nose. This is a kind of training. Very, very, very few people do this. One would be like a wine taster, maybe some chefs. They actually spend their time smelling. Most people don't. It's a very weak one. And yet, if you recollect and remember that dogs are very good, much of their life is spent on smelling. They've got good sense of smell and they know what things smell like and they remember smells in a way that humans just don't. However, humans are very good with sight. We can see things and then remember it, but it's still not well trained. That in fact, in the old times of the Buddha, and we still have some of this, and that is to be able to remember quite well. An example of that would be the Kasina meditations, and one of them is a mud pie or maybe a group of leaves that are stitched together. And so you look at it and then close your eyes and try to remember exactly what it looked like, and then open your eyes again and then close them. Another example of this is in the Tibetan system when they have mandalas, when they have thangkas, they know exactly what that mandala is going to look like. And so you can have 5 or 6 months sitting on the floor with various colored sand, and they can all do that same Mandala. They know exactly what it's going to look like, and they pour that sand so that it looks exactly like that. The same thing is true with an artist. They train their eyesight so that they can remember what something looks like, and then they can reproduce it. But most people don't have that kind of training, and so when we see something, we really don't see it very well because we haven't really trained our eyes for it. Well, here's something: that skill, by being an artist or being able to do a Mandala, that might be a nice skill, but it's not going to make you happy. The question is, can you develop the skill of looking at what your thoughts are? Now, that's a much better skill to have, is to be able to see exactly the kind of thought, what it is, how you're using it, so that you can do something about it. Just like an artist will use paint or a pencil or an ink pen or something, they know exactly what something is going to look like. You've seen some of them perhaps on the internet where somebody is just, you know, they may be writing a number and then they'll draw this line and that line and it looks like they're just doing things randomly and pretty soon it winds up an exact image of something that you've seen before. So how do they do that? The question really, though, is, is that how can you begin to see your thoughts the same way, so that you know exactly the kind of thoughts that you're having, and you begin to have the kind of thoughts that you want to have? And when I'm using the word thought in this regard, I'm talking about visual images, I'm talking about didactic or discursive thought, and I'm also talking about feelings, which is a kind of thought. So you see something, and then you process it, and then you don't like it. And all of those are different kinds of thoughts. I see it, I process it, I think about it, I come up with a conclusion, and I don't like it. These are all different kinds of thoughts. So can you actually begin to control those various kinds of thoughts so that when you see something with your eyes, you actually see? And when you're processing data, you know that you're actually processing data. You can begin to understand what perception really is, and you can actually perceive and watch yourself making shit up. And then you can see your own reactions and begin to recognize that you do have control over the way you feel, because you do have control over the way you process data. But most of us don't ever have those kind of skills. Some people will develop marvelous skills on the computer, but they'll spend their whole life miserable. So can you take those kind of skills that we need and start applying them so that you can begin to see things clearly, see yourself processing that data clearly, and come up with a clear solution that is wholesome so that you can have the kind of feelings that you want to have? So, Ross Let me go back to you. Oh, Amrit, you still got a question. You got your hand up. Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I have one another point. So I think it's more etymological. So when you— so there are people who say Samadhi means concentration, this means no thought, right? And you always define Samadhi is like a wholesome state of mind. And then you also define instead of no thought, you want like wholesome thoughts. I think this wholesome thought is connected to the Samadhi as like a whole mind, as a whole.

**Speaker A:** Right, that we begin to integrate. For instance, when we have this random thought and that unwholesome thought and that thought over there, the mind is scattered. A clear example of that is we have a thought about things should be this way, and then we have another thought, oh, I like it this way, and then we have another thought, oh, this is how it actually is. Okay, so that makes us a crowd inside, and that we can become unified in the mind, but the place that we become unified is not what we like and not how things should be, but we become unified in reality of this is how things actually are. Okay, and the word concentration is almost always misapplied. That in fact, when you use the word concentration, use instead the word tight, struggle. When you tell a kid to concentrate on their homework, they knit their brows, they look like they're working really hard. But the word Samadhi doesn't mean working hard, what it means instead, is, let's bring things together. Let's get real and stop making stuff up. And so I caution everyone to be careful with the word concentration, that in fact a much better use of the word would be repetition, to keep doing something wholesome over and over and over again, just like we have been concentrating on and repeating unwholesome things over and over and over again. That's what makes us tight, is because we keep doing unwholesome things over and over again. But if you start doing wholesome things over and over and over again, that's what brings on Samadhi integration. And so the word concentration is often misleading, and the students wind up with maybe 20,000 hours of meditation practice, and they haven't gotten anywhere, because they were just repeating what they've been repeating their whole life, and not actually investigating the thoughts, and start recognizing that this is an unwholesome thought, let's change it. The whole point that I've heard about the word noting, the Mahayana method of noting, and they note the Dukkha, and then they note the Dukkha, and then they note more Dukkha, and then they see how this Dukkha is connected to that Dukkha, and then they're going down the rat hole of Dukkha. All unwholesome thoughts, one after another after another, but at least they're noting unwholesome thoughts. The question is, can they change those thoughts? And the answer to that is, they haven't been taught to do that. They've been taught to note. This is why you've heard of the expression "the dark night of the soul." The dark night of the soul is when everything falls apart, because everything becomes Dukkha. But at the end of that, people get the idea that, "Wait a minute, I do have to make a change. I've got to redouble my effort. Back on the Eightfold Noble Path and actually make a change. And so noting Dukkha is actually a skill that they've learned, but they need to learn another skill, which is to change that unwholesomeness. So, Ross, are you there? I'm here. All right, you had your hand up there for a moment.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, it was, um, it was just more around what Amrit was saying. Um, it's more of an observation than a question. I just find that whenever I— like today, I sat down on the beach, I was looking at the ocean, and as far as I can recollect, I didn't have any thoughts. I was just enjoying the experience. Yeah, and I find, and I find that whenever I'm in nature, if I'm going for— if I go for a walk, I sit in a forest. I've got a couple of, you know, forests not too far from where I am. I sit down, there's no thoughts. As soon as I come back into, uh, you know, get in the car, there's traffic, I'm talking to people, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, the thoughts come back again. Yeah. Okay, so again, we have to define what we mean by thought, because when you are out in nature, you were observing nature, right? Well, that's a kind of a thought. It's a pretty wholesome thought too, not having the discursive thoughts. You don't have to talk to yourself, 'Oh, there's a bunny rabbit. Oh, there's a flower. Oh, I see the sky. Oh, there's a cloud.' You don't use that kind of language. You just look at the bunny rabbit, you look at the flower, and you're just enjoying the flower, and you're not having a conversation with yourself about the flower. But when you go to the car, where's my car keys? And the thoughts, the discursive thoughts, start back up again. That's right. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** It was just more of an observation.

**Speaker A:** So maybe continue to observe. That's the whole point of this practice, is observe so that you can make changes to it. All right. So by the way, you had a question originally. What was your question?

**Speaker B:** It was about the Buddha advising some of his students to recollect death at all times and whether that was an effective practice.

**Speaker A:** I would not say recollect death all the time, but I would say here's an example of what I'm getting at. Is it Goenka? When I was with him, he had an old VCR recording. You know what the VCR, the tapes? Way back when, of an autopsy. And the students would watch that autopsy. Also, the Buddha did. In fact, there's a story that we can tell about that. In the early, early days, before Ananda was around, he would give the Bhikkhus the job of going to the charnel ground and watching bodies rot. And on one occasion he took a hike and was off for a couple of months. He comes back and he asked one of the attendants, where is everybody? And he says, oh, well, they've all killed themselves. They're all right here in the charnel ground. Okay, you become what you think. And so I would not recommend doing a charnel ground meditation or watching dead bodies all the time. But going to a morgue occasionally, going to a funeral home, even learning to do embalming, that would give you the idea and the understanding that you're going to die. Now, the joke is, is that when medical doctors or new medical doctors, the advanced students of medicine, they are actually put into a situation to where they've got a master old doctor that's going to perform an autopsy while 8, 10, 12 students are standing there. And his job is to have that autopsy done so perfectly that every one of his students passes out or throws up right in front of him. Why is that? Because they identify with that corpse. I am that dead body when they take that knife and slit it this way. I am that body when they take the knife and slit it this way. I am that body when they grab the heart and pull it out. I am that body when they open the skull and pull out the brain. That's my brain. Okay, here's an example of that. Is that— have you ever been around someone who was sick or injured, like they've got a bone sticking out? Yeah. One of the qualities of a good doctor is, is that while he is setting that bone He has the mentality, I'm setting this bone, it's not my bone. So the whole point about the charnel ground recollections has two qualities of it. One is stop identifying with every corpse you find. That's not you. But the second part of it is also, um, is that You are going to die in a foreign kind of way. This is an example of what's going to happen to you. You someday will be on an autopsy table, or having fluid, formaldehyde, embalming fluid, pumped through. You are going to be in a a casket or maybe burned. That happens to every one of us. We're all going to die. And so being around dead bodies is actually a good idea so that we can begin to understand that. But don't spend too much time in it because then you really will identify with that corpse and you might want to lay down beside them and die with them. Carl, you had your hand up there for a minute.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was gonna ask you about when you say, "You are gonna be there." We're talking in a sense of a body. But that is also very futuristic in the sense that we practicing for the future in a way, right? But the future is not really known, so there is no you in that future yet, and there can never actually be. So what's the purpose of actually contemplating on the body, the dissolution of the body in this present moment? It's not, it's not ever going to be in the future.

**Speaker A:** Here's the answer to that. Have you heard of the expression that there are only two things that are certain? Death and taxes. Michael, have you ever heard that before? Dhammarato, you and Rhett, you've heard that before, right? The only two things that are really certain is death and taxes. Guess what? That's half wrong. Taxes are optional. Donald Trump is a good example of taxes being optional. But death, that you're not going to be able to avoid. You are going to die. That is in fact why people get sad at funerals. They're not sad because grandma died. They're sad because grandma dying reminds them that they're going to die. That's that self-preservation instinct again. We don't like being around death. In fact, in the West, they would rather the grandma die in a hospital rather than die in her bed, the same bed that you sleep in. You don't want to be, you know, wake up in the middle of the night and Granny's stone cold dead right there on in your bed. I've had that with dogs, but I haven't had it with a person, but it's the same feeling. You don't like that puppy dying. Why? Because it's so attached to our own. We don't want to die. It's terrible that the puppy died. It's terrible that Granny died. That's why we want to put her in the hospital to die so that she's way over there at a great distance to us. So going back to the point that Ross was making, it's a really good idea to get over that. Just like for a doctor, it's really good idea for him to not be squeamish when he's setting a bone. He's got to do that professionally. He's got to come out of the identification of it. So can you begin to come out of your identification with death and see that right now I'm alive? Whoop-de-doo, I'm alive! I'm going to die someday, but when I do, I'm going to be able to say, "Whoop-de-doo, not yet! I've got 2 breaths left, maybe 1." Yes, but— But I am ready to die. This breath may be the last one. Let me enjoy that completely. "Oh wow, what a good breath this is, it's my last one, I'm going to really enjoy it." So this is the way that we do. We can prepare for our own death. Why? Because if you can die happily, you can live happily. Because your death is the only important thing that you've got. In fact, you could say that about the breath. The only thing important is you keep breathing. If you're taking this breath Oh wow, at least I got another one. Wow, isn't that a sweet breath? I really like this breath because I'm still alive, I'm still breathing. However, there's going to be a last one. Can you make sure that you're ready so that when you have a last breath, that you enjoy that breath? When you have a last thought— this is actually quite a lot in Buddhism, to be able to control your mind and train yourself so that your last thought is a happy thought. Well, finally it's over. Goodbye, cruel world. Kachunga.

**Speaker C:** That's exactly what I was talking about, is even you, when you say death, it's like it sounds scary, but can we transition that into like, oh, death?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like, here it is, I've been waiting on you.

**Speaker C:** That's what I meant by body.

**Speaker A:** Oh, body.

**Speaker C:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** I've never died before. I really haven't. I've been pretty close. Thomas, have you ever actually died before? No. So you don't know what it's like. That's one thing that I cannot say, been there, done that, because I have not been there and I have not done that. But guess what? I'm going to do it, and I'm going to enjoy the hell out of it. I'm going to be there for it. Now, one of the ways that you can train yourself with that is by sleep, because sleep is very much like dying, and dying is very much like sleep. Can you lay there in the bed at night and watch yourself go to sleep? Sweet, sweet slumber. I like it. Can you recognize that and see yourself actually going to sleep? Rather than one moment you're thinking about blah blah and the next thing you know it's the next morning and you don't even know that you went through a process called going to sleep. Because there's also going to be a process called dying, and I really want to be there for it. So the way to know how you— that moment of death when you are dying is because you can actually observe going to sleep. And you can go to sleep happily. In fact, the problem that most people have going to sleep is that, oh, I've got so much to do tomorrow. And a better thing to do is Anapanasati. Oh wow, it's so nice. Oh, I'm just so comfortable. Let me just watch myself falling into slumber. And if I can watch myself going to sleep, I'll be ready then to watch myself to die. Now, I go to sleep every night. I get absolutely a lot of opportunity to watch myself go to sleep so that I could prepare for that one event. I'm only going to die one time. I want to be there for it. I want to watch what happens. So that's the basic attitude that you can have is that you look forward to death. Now is not the time, you don't want to force it, but someday it's going to come. Are you ready for it when it does? Because if you're ready to die at any moment, that means you're ready to live this one. If I can handle death, I can handle life. So be ready to die. This is the reason why the Buddha recommended the charnel ground, to get ready for it's going to happen. But it doesn't mean that you want to axe yourself. You don't want to bring it on early. You want to let it happen naturally.

**Speaker C:** Contemplating on death can also help us get rid of the little other fears that we have throughout the day. That we still withhold and we don't live out fully, like little fears, little moments. I'm afraid to do this. I'm afraid to text my boss. I'm afraid to do this. And those are like little deaths that happen.

**Speaker A:** Those are little deaths. Exactly. Anytime that you become afraid, remember that the fear itself comes from that part of the brain, the amygdala and the medulla oblongata and all that kind of stuff there in the back of the brain is a self-preservation mechanism. Every fear you have, the base of it is fear of death. So when that bully comes around the corner and that 14-year-old kid, he's scared to death of that bully. That's literally what they mean, scared to death, because in fact what we are is we're afraid to die. So all of your fears— I mean, you open that bank statement and it's got $100 less than you expected, and you become afraid. Why? Because that $100 is a matter of life and death. And when you recognize that, no, it's not, it's just a bank statement. I'm still alive. I used to have $10,000 in that bank account, now there's only $400 in it, but I'm still alive. Why should I be afraid because the bank account is empty? I'm still alive. Okay, so this is the way that we can handle this, to recognize that every fear that you have is stupid. Every fear we have is ignorant. Every fear you have— because look how many times you've been afraid in your life and you haven't even died yet. Arahant. So all the fears that you've ever had have been worthless, useless, unhappy, unwholesome thoughts and feelings. You've been lying to yourself all of those times when you've become afraid. There's no reason to be afraid. Now, in fact, the way that we use it is, is that we want to punish our children. We want to make them afraid so that they'll behave themselves. So when a little kid rushes out into the street to catch his ball, Daddy's going to yell at him, and the child becomes afraid, and so he stops. It would be much better for Daddy to take him out to the curb and says, you look this way and you look that way, and you train that self so that you don't have to become afraid about running into the street. You don't have to become afraid because Daddy's yelling at you. We don't train our kids that way. We make our children afraid, and we grow up afraid, and we live our lives afraid, when in fact, mostly, we're not in any danger at all. So this is a big part of Anapanasati practice, is to recognize right now you're not in danger. Don't be afraid right now. Yeah, I've got to write the boss an email. I'll do it later. Right now I'm feeling too good. I'm not going to write it right now. But most of the time when we think, oh, I've got to write the boss an email, oh me, oh, I'm gonna die, when in fact an email doesn't kill anybody. So this is why we work with it in the sense of become patient. Stop having goals, stop having deadlines, because if you have a deadline, that means you're going to die if you don't get it done in time. And so a deadline is an actual production mechanism for fear. And a big part of Anapanasati is becoming safe, feeling secure, come out of those feelings, that in fact now we can even think of death and I'm not afraid of it. It's going to happen, but why should I be afraid? We can train ourselves like that, train to become fearless, train to become having the feeling of safe and secure. And then at the moment of death, you can still feel safe and secure. I'm okay. Yeah, I'm dying, but that's all right. You can have a peaceful death, happy death, but you got to train for that with Anapanasati. Whatever happens, it's not a reason to become afraid. Yeah, I gotta write the boss an email, but I don't care. I'm still alive. Finding that email is not going to kill me. So this is the way that we begin to practice Anapanasati, is to look at the fact that we become afraid. Remember that part when I was talking about being face down in the mud and not even knowing it? That happens because of fear. We're afraid. That's what we mean by falling down, is that we fall down into fear. All negative feelings come from fear. They've got a base of fear at every one of them. For instance, anybody that becomes angry already has fear. Somebody becomes angry because he's insulted? No, he's become angry because he was afraid that that insult is going to harm him, maybe even kill him. So fear brings on anger, frustration, panic, stress, fatigue, sadness, guilt, grief. All of those feelings all have fear. And ultimately the fear is, is that whatever it was that we're afraid of is going to kill us. And so the real practice of Anapanasati is coming out of that stupid ignorant lie that we tell ourselves that this is dangerous, when in fact it's not. It's not going to kill us. Getting a spanking when we're 4 years old generally doesn't kill us. Child abuse doesn't kill the child, but it sure messes him up. Why? Because now he's afraid. But if the child is not afraid, then he can live his life happily. But I don't know of anyone here who has actually never become afraid and started the habit of being afraid. Everybody here is in the habit of being afraid. And we'll just go around finding things to be afraid about. We feel the fear and then you say, well, what was it? Oh, it must be because I didn't write that email. Oh, I feel terrified. Why? Maybe the flight tire, whatever it is. So we make up excuses about why we feel afraid when we're in fact just in the habit of having a thought of fear. So now we're going to practice having thoughts of everything is okay. Everything is fine, not a problem in the world. Even if I'm dying, that's still not a problem. Got no worries, no worries, nothing. Everything's got no place to go and nothing to do, and everything is hunky-dory, everything's okay. This is how we practice so that we could come out of that state of fear, come out of the one who is a victim to his fear and become fearless. This is a major teaching of the Buddha. There's several suttas about coming out of our fear, to confront our fear, to recognize that what we thought was danger, not danger at all. This is part of the reason why going and looking at an autopsy, either on a video or standing right there when the body's being cut open, is to recognize that that body can get cut open, but it's not going to be dangerous to you. That what's dangerous to you is your feeling of being afraid. So we've been droning on and on for a while now. I hope you guys are going to be afraid that this talk is over. So Thomas, do you have any remarks? I've seen you smiling there. You've been smiling and nodding a.

My Skype hasn't crashed in a few minutes now, so all good. Everything— I don't want to risk turning my camera on though. Okay, well, does anybody have any last words? Any last thumbs up? Any last smiles? All right, guys, well, we'll see you later. Have fun, everyone. I've had fun. This has been a good talk. Excellent. Thank you, folks. We'll see you. All right. Wow, what a big crowd.

**Speaker D:** The.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on **critical discernment in studying the Buddha's teachings, the goal of Stream Entry (Sotāpanna), and practical meditation as a path to happiness and fearlessness.**

Here is a structured summary of the key themes:

### 1. **The "Polluted" Suttas: Discernment is Required**
*   The core teachings (suttas) have been altered and added to over 2,500 years by individuals who, lacking a "pure mind," inserted their own beliefs and "magical thinking."
*   **Key Metaphor:** The true Dhamma is like a small shrine in the woods you can only enter by leaving all baggage (personal views, cultural beliefs) outside. Over millennia, the hillside is buried under others' baggage, and many mistake the baggage for the teachings themselves.
*   **Sources of Corruption:** This process began early, even with Ananda, the Buddha's attendant. While knowledgeable, he was not yet enlightened during the Buddha's life and may have influenced the oral tradition with his own understanding.
*   **Advice:** Students must read the suttas with **wisdom and discernment**, learning to separate the core Dhamma from later additions. The **Sutta Nipāta** and **Udāna** are suggested as among the purest early sources.

### 2. **The Central Goal: Stream Entry (Sotāpanna)**
*   The primary aim of practice is to become a **Sotāpanna** ("stream enterer"), the first stage of enlightenment.
*   **What it is:** It's "entering the stream" of Dhamma. Life becomes centered on Dhamma, characterized by **delight, enthusiasm, and seeing Dhamma everywhere**.
*   **What it is NOT:** It is not a permanent, fixed state one "achieves" and then claims. It's a **skill** that one moves in and out of—"sometimes you're in the stream, sometimes you're not." A true teacher would recognize it; self-proclamation is a red flag.
*   **The Practical Path:** It's a progressive training in happiness (*sukha*) and rapture (*pīti*) through practices like **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing). One trains to enter a wholesome, joyful state, sustain it, and increasingly dwell there.

### 3. **Rejecting "Magical Thinking" for This-Life Practice**
*   A major barrier to Stream Entry is belief in **rebirth, reincarnation, and supernatural powers**. These are cultural baggage and "magical thinking" stemming from our self-preservation instinct and societal conditioning.
*   **The Buddha's Pragmatism:** The Buddha's goal was to end *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction) **in this very life**. He sometimes used the language of rebirth to communicate with those who already believed in it, but the ultimate teaching is about ending the cycle of suffering now.
*   **The Danger:** Believing in future lives can become an excuse to postpone earnest practice. The message is: **You can end suffering now. Don't wait for a "better" future life.**

### 4. **Practical Meditation: Working with Thoughts**
*   **The First Skill:** The goal isn't to eliminate thoughts from the start, but to **learn to control them**—specifically, to replace unwholesome, suffering-based thoughts with wholesome, happy ones.
*   **The Process:** Recognize an unwholesome thought (e.g., fear, anger) with a playful, watchful attitude—"Aha, I see you, Mara!"—and then let it go, returning to a wholesome thought. This is the essence of the **first jhāna**.
*   **Integration, Not Just Concentration:** *Samādhi* is better understood as **unification and integration of a wholesome mind**, not as strained concentration. It's about repeating wholesome mental states until the mind becomes unified in clarity and happiness.
*   **Dealing with Fear:** All negative emotions (anger, sadness, stress) are rooted in **fear**, which itself is rooted in the fear of death. Ānāpānasati practice cultivates a sense of safety and security, realizing that most perceived threats are not matters of life and death. By learning to face small fears, we prepare to face death itself fearlessly.

### 5. **The Role of a Good Friend (Kalyāṇamitta)**
*   A good Dhamma friend or teacher helps point out when we are "face down in the mud" of our own suffering and ignorance, often without realizing it. They do this not with criticism, but with joyful encouragement to "get up" and return to happiness.

### 6. **Contemplation of Death (Maraṇasati)**
*   Reflecting on death is recommended not to be morbid, but to **undermine fear and prioritize present-moment practice**.
*   **Purpose:** It helps put daily worries into perspective (e.g., fear of texting your boss is a "little death" rooted in the same instinct). By becoming ready to die peacefully, we learn to live fully and fearlessly now.
*   **Practical Training:** The transition into sleep is a good analogy for practicing awareness of life's transitions, including the final one.

**Overall Message:** The path is about **joyful, diligent practice in the present moment**, using discernment to find the Buddha's core message of ending suffering, developing skill in cultivating wholesome states of mind, and moving toward the joyful, fearless freedom of Stream Entry.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to illustrate key points about Buddhist practice, the corruption of teachings, and the path to enlightenment. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1. **The Shrine in the Woods / Baggage Metaphor**
   - **Description:** The Dharma is compared to a small, ancient shrine in the wilderness that can only be entered if you leave all your baggage outside. Over 2,500 years, the hillside has become covered with the baggage (personal interpretations, cultural beliefs, ego) of thousands of visitors.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate how the original teachings (suttas) have been obscured and distorted by people’s personal biases and cultural baggage. Many modern teachers mistake the accumulated baggage for the Dharma itself.

2. **Entering the Stream / River Metaphor**
   - **Description:** Becoming a *Sotāpanna* (stream enterer) is compared to entering a river. Beginners may only put a toe in, then retreat. With practice, they learn to swim, float, or even lie on their back and let the current carry them.
   - **Purpose:** To describe the progressive, non-linear nature of spiritual development. It emphasizes that stream-entry is a fluctuating state of being “in” or “out” of the Dharma flow, not a fixed achievement.

3. **Beach and Surfing Metaphor**
   - **Description:** People hesitate to enter the “stream” (Dharma) like someone lingering on a bug-infested, hot beach instead of jumping into the ocean. Some jump in and drown (struggle), others learn to swim, and masters learn to surf or float effortlessly.
   - **Purpose:** To depict the stages of practice—from reluctance, to struggle, to skillfulness, and finally to effortless mastery.

4. **Shade-Tree Mechanic / Making Up Parts**
   - **Description:** People trying to fix their lives are compared to a rural mechanic in the 1950s who invents makeshift parts (baling wire, bubble gum) because genuine parts are unavailable.
   - **Purpose:** To explain how we use our own fabricated beliefs and “magical thinking” to patch together an understanding of reality, rather than using the “original parts” of the Buddha’s true teachings.

5. **Falling Down in the Mud**
   - **Description:** Having an unwholesome thought is compared to slipping and falling face-down in mud. An unskilled person wallows in self-pity, while a skilled practitioner laughs, gets up, dusts themselves off, and moves on.
   - **Purpose:** To teach how to handle unwholesome thoughts without identification or judgment—acknowledge them (“Aha, I see you, Mara!”) and quickly return to a wholesome state.

6. **Thoughts as Gaps and Unification**
   - **Description:** The mind’s progress is compared to moving from constant discursive thought, to having more wholesome thoughts with gaps between them, to longer periods of silent clarity (“nothing”).
   - **Purpose:** To map the advanced stages of meditation where the mind becomes unified (*samādhi*) and peaceful, interspersing wholesome thoughts with expansive stillness.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Story of Ananda and the First Council**
   - **Description:** After the Buddha’s death, the enlightened disciples held a council to preserve the teachings. Ananda, the Buddha’s attendant, was initially excluded because he was still an ordinary person (*puthujjana*) and had likely mixed his own interpretations into the teachings. He attained enlightenment just before the council and was admitted, but his earlier influence had already “polluted” some suttas.
   - **Purpose:** To give a historical example of how distortions entered the Buddhist texts early on, even from a devoted follower who was close to the Buddha.

2. **The Layman in Fancy Clothes (Sutta 54)**
   - **Description:** A layman claims to have renounced all attachments, but the Buddha points out he still wears fine clothes, carries a parasol, and wears nice sandals. The Buddha calls him a “householder,” angering him.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate the difference between intellectual understanding and genuine renunciation, and how the Buddha skillfully taught people at their own level—sometimes using concepts like rebirth that they already believed in.

3. **The Dalai Lama and the Tulku System**
   - **Description:** The speaker references the Dalai Lama’s announcement that he will not reincarnate, which undermines the Tibetan Tulku system. This is compared to the Buddha’s true teaching of non-rebirth.
   - **Purpose:** To contrast popular “magical thinking” about rebirth with the enlightened perspective that sees no substantial self to be reborn. It shows how even high-level figures use skillful means within cultural belief systems.

4. **The Autopsy / Charnel Ground Story**
   - **Description:** The Buddha sent monks to contemplate decaying corpses in charnel grounds. Once, after returning from a trip, he found many monks had committed suicide because they over-identified with the corpses.
   - **Purpose:** To warn about the danger of misapplying meditation on death (leading to morbidity and identification) and to highlight its proper use: to understand impermanence without fear, and to prepare for one’s own death with mindfulness and joy.

5. **The Policeman’s Career Choice**
   - **Description:** A policeman asked the speaker (when he was a monk) about Dharma. The speaker advised that to truly enter the Dharma, he’d have to quit his job, as a policeman’s role is to distribute *dukkha* (suffering) through arrests and enforcement.
   - **Purpose:** To emphasize that deep commitment to the Dharma (*stream-entry*) often requires a fundamental life reorientation away from professions that cause harm, towards those that reduce suffering.

6. **Western vs. Thai Teenagers Falling Down**
   - **Description:** When a teenager falls, Westerners often react with either bullying laughter or pity, while in Thailand, the whole group—including the fallen teen—laughs it off easily.
   - **Purpose:** To contrast cultural attitudes toward adversity. It models the ideal Dharma attitude: seeing a stumble (or an unwholesome thought) as a minor, laughable event, not a tragedy.

### **Overall Function**
These metaphors and stories serve to:
- **Demystify complex doctrines** (like stream-entry, *samādhi*, and non-rebirth).
- **Critique religious corruption** and cultural baggage.
- **Provide relatable imagery** for mental training and meditation.
- **Encourage a joyful, fearless, and practical approach** to practice in daily life.
- **Distinguish the Buddha’s core teachings** from later accretions of “magical thinking.”
