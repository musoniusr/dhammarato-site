### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so let's start the recording. Yes, Nike?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just wanted to announce for the people watching this on YouTube to go check out the Dharma Friends Discord. There'll be a link in the YouTube description. Skype is closing down, so for now we'll be moving over there. And please be sure to send a friend request to Dhammarato and myself once you're on the Discord. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Hello, Ivan, good to see you. Hello, Dhammarato. All right, so this is Saturday morning in Thailand, uh, and, um, we will be talking about, um, uh, fear and craving and those kind of things. But the way that we're going to start is by talking about Paticcasamuppada. Now, there are 12 steps in Paticcasamuppada, and feelings like feelings of fear is actually step 7, and then craving would be steps 8 and 9. So with that as a reference, what we can say is that when you see something, hear something, feel something, taste something, watching a video, etc., like that, what you actually see in reality is not what impacts you. What impacts you is your own, let us say, memory base, and that For instance, the eyes can only see colors, shapes, and movement, and the ears can only hear sound waves. The interpretation of those images that come in through the eyes go through quite a filtration process. And that it happens very, very quickly with several different parts of the mind. And one of the parts of the mind, in fact, the thing that's most interesting is that the eyes physiologically, neurologically, they break into two groups so that one set of pieces of information come into the cerebellum in the back for processing, and the other one, uh, eye goes directly into the frontal cortex. Now, uh, with that, what we mean is, is that some things that we see, we react to instantly, and then others need to be processed. And that is almost always the processed data that impacts us. So going through the cerebellum means then that we do a processing step, and that processing in the Pali is referred to as nama-rupa. But in our language, we can call it perception, or almost you could say it is preception in the sense that we don't see exactly what the eyes see. What we see instead is something that is processed to try to make sense of it, so that when you see, let us say, a coiled snake, all you see is the coil. The word snake is what we add to it because we've seen snakes before. Arahant. And the same thing is true on YouTube. When you see some politician, some snake, all you see is a face and an image, but what you process it into is snake, so that we become fearful of what we're seeing and hearing, when in fact it takes a whole lot of processing before we get to that point. And now the processing turns into then the result of the process, which we can call a story, we can call it a concept, we can call it an understanding, etc. In the Pali, this is called salyattana. Now, saleyatana actually means the internal sense base. So the external sense base, the actual eyes and the mechanism of seeing, is part of the atana, one of the senses. But the processed data then is called saleyatana. Hello, Vinaya, good to see you.

**Speaker C:** Hi, I'm driving.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, um, when we then have something processed, that's what impacts us, and the impact then generally leads to feelings. Now, there are three kinds of feelings. One is a feeling of I like it. You see a picture of a cheesecake, oh, I like that. We see a picture of something really ugly, "Oh, I don't like that." Or the third one is kind of a mixture that has both the liking and the not liking built into it, and this also can be considered or be called confusion, and that confusion then is normally what leads to fear. In other words, you can see a politician on YouTube and you can have the feeling of disgust, you can have the feeling of repulsion, you can have the feeling of 'I like him, I like this politician,' or you can have the feeling that's based in fear, that you become afraid when you see something. So this is a built-in system. It's actually part of our DNA. And another way of talking about it is that it's part of our instinctual system, and the instinct is primarily based upon self-preservation, that we're trying to preserve the life. Except that that self-preservation instinct was started.

**Speaker C:** Way, way back when we were all.

**Speaker A:** Jungle bunnies and monkeys traveling through the jungle. And that in those days, that self-preservation instinct often would save us from getting eaten. That you hear the rustle in the grass, and we immediately become afraid. We don't know what it is, and so we climb up a tree or run away. Now, here's a reason for that, is that false positives generally don't hurt us so much as negative responses, false negatives. Now, here's what I mean. Imagine that you were, um, let us say, with another person way back when. We probably didn't have much of anything called clothing. Maybe we had a spear, and that we're walking down an ancient pathway, and behind us we hear a rustle in the grass. Now, we don't know what it is, But if it brings up fear immediately, one of those guys who is fearful is going to run. The other one is going to turn around in curiosity to see what it was rustling in the grass, and it's.

**Speaker C:** Quite possibly he got eaten.

**Speaker A:** The time that it took to turn around to see what it was was just the amount of time that a leopard or a tiger or whatever would pounce. And so what that means is with natural selection, it's more likely that modern generation is going to respond to something that they're not sure about with fear, as opposed to just idle curiosity. So this is built in, it's part of the DNA, is part of our self-preservation instinct. But the problem nowadays is that almost all of our responses are false positives. An example of that is that you're watching on your PC, or you're watching on a television cable, watching on your cell phone some video And we have been kind of programmed that these newscasts are real, just like a real snake or a real rustle in the grass, to where in fact they're not. They're just an image. But we process those images and those sounds as if they were real, as if that politician that is disgusting or fearful is going to jump right out of the telephone or right out of your cell phone and bite you right then and there. Well, of course that's not going to happen logically, but our feeling systems aren't logical. They're instincts. They're natural reactions that have saved humanity from being eaten, everyone. And so you can say then, the very false positives that saved us way back when now really interfere with our lives because we don't take the time to really look. We just react. And so this is where the teachings of the Buddha comes in, in the sense of what we can do instead of immediately reacting is that we can go back and look again. An example of that would be look.

**Speaker C:** And see, this is just an image on the cell phone, or pornography is just a piece of paper.

**Speaker A:** It's not a real sexual item, it's.

**Speaker C:** Just a piece of paper, it's just.

**Speaker A:** An image on the cell phone, it's just an image of a politician. Now one of the things that really is interesting about news is that especially nowadays, but even in the old days when we actually had newspapers, the headlines generally of the newspaper, the front page of the newspaper, was what sells newspapers. And so journalism for the past more than 100 years has had the point.

**Speaker B:** Of.

**Speaker A:** If it bleeds it leads. In other words, humans are interested in danger. If we had the front page of the newspaper that would have a headline.

**Speaker C:** 'Today is a good day,'.

**Speaker A:** People will.

**Speaker C:** See that headline and not buy the newspaper.

**Speaker A:** But if they see the front page.

**Speaker C:** Headline and it says the courthouse is.

**Speaker A:** Burning down, then people will buy the newspaper. So our news nowadays is based upon that perspective, based upon that point that they want to keep their audience. And so much of the information that.

**Speaker C:** We have— you say things actually happen.

**Speaker A:** Pretty slowly But if there's a blow-by-blow description— let's take the example of a prize fight— that every time that your man gets hit, we say, "Oh no, we've lost the battle," and every time that the opponent gets hit by our guy, we say, "Yay, we're winning!".

**Speaker C:** And that bout may go 15 rounds.

**Speaker A:** Before the actual end. And so what we're doing is we're making up the end game based upon things that are just part of the process. Oh no, things are terrible because of tariffs is one of the things.

**Speaker C:** Well, guess what? We don't know the final outcome of that. In fact, we don't ever know the finality of anything.

**Speaker A:** But what we can do instead is recognize that, oh, the game is not over.

**Speaker C:** Why should I feel like that the.

**Speaker A:** Game is over now? That in fact, if we can see.

**Speaker C:** Reality, the actual reality is not the.

**Speaker A:** Image on the cell phone or the YouTube broadcast, but rather that you're sitting.

**Speaker C:** In your chair holding the cell phone, and that the chair that you're sitting in is in a room that's relatively safe.

**Speaker A:** But we don't do that.

**Speaker C:** We'll get focused on that cell phone.

**Speaker A:** And see the news broadcast, and then.

**Speaker C:** Live as if that's our only reality.

**Speaker A:** We get sucked in, is a way of talking about it. Another way of talking about it is that there used to be, I think back in the '80s, a bumper sticker that was quite common that life is shit and then you die. Or another way of saying it is.

**Speaker C:** Is that life sucks.

**Speaker A:** Well, guess what, Simon?

**Speaker C:** Life sucks only because we're sucking. If we would stop sucking, if we.

**Speaker A:** Would stop slurping then life wouldn't suck. That we're sucking on something, and the.

**Speaker C:** Way that that can be interpreted is.

**Speaker A:** That we want something because we want to feel safe and secure. And we get confused that the cell phone or some advertisement and getting what's being advertised, etc., like that, is going to make me feel good, make me feel comfortable, make me feel secure. And the reality is, is that if you would stop sucking on stuff, you would recognize that you're already safe, you're already secure, you're already comfortable. That we make stuff up and then we react to that stuff that we've made up, and we make that stuff up based upon the input that we have that's not fully processed. And so this is where the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha really begins to get valuable for us, in the sense of remembering to look clearly at what's going on, to take in more input than just the broadcast on the cell phone, more than just Fox, more than just NBC, more than just MSNBC more than CNN. But the fact that the CNN is.

**Speaker C:** Actually just something very small, it's right here in front of you.

**Speaker A:** And look at your reality around you. And so we often get sucked into these videos, we get sucked into the.

**Speaker C:** News, we think that right now that's.

**Speaker A:** The only thing that's real. And the news broadcasters trying to stay in business want you to be afraid. They want to keep you tuned in. They want you to feel bad, because.

**Speaker C:** If they can get you to feel.

**Speaker A:** Bad, then you will continue to be.

**Speaker C:** On guard, to be in a sense.

**Speaker A:** Of danger, and you'll keep tuning into.

**Speaker C:** Their broadcast to find out what's next, what's next, what's next.

**Speaker A:** And that's almost delusional. That's almost delusional that they would do that to us. They're trying to stay in business. They're trying to get you to become part of their audience in the sense.

**Speaker C:** Of part of— in other words, you.

**Speaker A:** Really care about what they're doing, what they're talking about.

**Speaker C:** And yet that is actually a very, very small part of your life.

**Speaker A:** For instance, your hand is bigger than the image on that cell phone. Your arm, your leg. How about the chair you're in? How about the room that you're in?

**Speaker C:** Everything in that room is probably safe.

**Speaker A:** Except what you're seeing on that cell phone looks dangerous. And so it's almost as bad as seeing a picture or a photograph of a snake and mistaking it for an actual real snake.

**Speaker C:** Where in fact it's not a snake at all, it's a piece of paper, it's a page out of a book.

**Speaker A:** It'S just an image.

**Speaker C:** But we've been trained to see those.

**Speaker A:** Images as not only real, but it's.

**Speaker C:** The most important thing that we're doing because that's what we're looking at right now.

**Speaker A:** And so With the Buddhist teaching, he.

**Speaker C:** Says, 'Ah, remember that reality is a whole lot bigger than what we get.

**Speaker A:** Stuck into, we get sucked into.' I've actually heard it explained this way by— I'm forgetting the comedian's name, but it's an old saw— and that is.

**Speaker C:** Is that what we see up close is tragedy.

**Speaker A:** But when seen from a distance, it's comedy.

**Speaker C:** And yet here we are, really sucked right into that image on the cell phone, and we see that what's close.

**Speaker A:** Up and right there as dangerous. It's a tragedy, not recognizing immediately that the news broadcast networks want you to feel that way. They've trained you to feel that way.

**Speaker C:** And all of the other people around you have been trained that way.

**Speaker A:** And so they're continuing to train each other and you to feel bad when they put something— bad news on the television or on the cell phone. If we can begin to see that our actual reality is much bigger much broader, and in true reality, not nearly as dangerous as what we're seeing on television. And so I would suggest for people who are beginning— and I'm talking about people who are beginning the Dhamma, is people who have not spent 20 years in it If you spent 20 years in the Dharma and are really, really practiced in the Dharma, then that means that you can now look at broadcast television and YouTube videos and not care, because it doesn't mean anything to you.

**Speaker C:** Because you are living in reality.

**Speaker A:** But for beginners, folks like yourselves on Skype and on Discord, I would highly recommend that you stop watching the news, or watch very little of it. Because something that's actually important happens in the world, you're going to hear about it anyway.

**Speaker C:** So why look at the blow-by-blow?

**Speaker A:** In other words, you'll hear about the end of the boxing match after the.

**Speaker C:** 15 rounds; let's wait for the actual.

**Speaker A:** Results of that fight, without having to go through a blow-by-blow description of it. That in fact the whole quality of the whole concept of blow-by-blow was done way back when, before we had television, we had radio. And so the radio announcer would sit there on the ringside and give a blow-by-blow description of it, hoping that people would be willing to listen to all.

**Speaker C:** Of the dangers, all the good shots, all the bad shots, uh, all the blows, etc., like that. Because that gives the radio announcer a job.

**Speaker A:** Well, when television came in, we didn't.

**Speaker C:** Need any announcers anymore. The game is being played.

**Speaker A:** We can just see the game.

**Speaker C:** Why is it that these games have these announcers rehashing instant replays and all of that, when it just showed you right what was happening in the first place. All you have to do is pay.

**Speaker A:** Attention to the game and you can see what's happening.

**Speaker C:** Well, that's actually what now has turned into the news. So what started out in radio, uh.

**Speaker A:** Having a blow-by-blow description, turned into then, uh, television sportscasters doing a blow-by-blow, and.

**Speaker C:** Now the news You see, in the.

**Speaker A:** Old days, newspapers only came out once a day, but now the news broadcasters.

**Speaker C:** On the cell phone, they're at it 24 hours a day.

**Speaker A:** You can go on to YouTube and.

**Speaker C:** And see 15 or 20 different broadcasts about what Donald Trump is doing right now or did yesterday, because they're all trying to make a living off of it. And so they're doing everything they can to keep you tuned into their station.

**Speaker A:** Including lying to you about it.

**Speaker C:** And so if the radio broadcaster is.

**Speaker A:** At the boxing match and he's giving.

**Speaker C:** His blow-by-blow description, if he has a.

**Speaker A:** Favorite fighter in that ring, he's going.

**Speaker C:** To talk up that fighter that's his favorite and talk down about the fighter that he's supposed to. So you're already getting his version of.

**Speaker A:** The fight, not the actual fight. The same thing is true. And then in fact, one of the things that I have noticed about YouTube.

**Speaker C:** Is about 90% of it is not correct. You've got to go through 100 videos before you'll get 5 or 10% of actual reality.

**Speaker A:** The rest of them are influencing, putting.

**Speaker C:** Their vision and their version on it.

**Speaker A:** And then adding on and piling on the danger. They want you to feel like you're in danger. And so for this reason, I would highly recommend that you don't bother listening to the news. Don't bother with it. It's dangerous.

**Speaker C:** It's dangerous only because it's dangerous in.

**Speaker A:** The sense that you'll get sucked into it thinking that what they're saying is real, when in fact it's only their opinion of it. Well, guess what? We're using the example of YouTube on cell phone, and that's just a small.

**Speaker C:** Part of your life. That in fact, much of what we have in life, all the people that.

**Speaker A:** You are dealing with— your moms, your dads, your families, your co-workers, students, Discord friends, etc.— like that are almost always putting their own spin on things and giving their own version of reality. And if we believe them, if we take that in, then we feel the way that they want you to feel. An example of that would be when someone is angry, they want you to be angry too.

**Speaker C:** They either want you to be angry.

**Speaker A:** At what they're angry at— like if.

**Speaker C:** A guy is angry at the bank, he's going to trash the bank and make sure that you feel as angry about the bank as he does. But if you find somebody that's angry.

**Speaker A:** At you, he wants you to come back and be angry at him, and.

**Speaker C:** You'Ll almost always oblige.

**Speaker A:** Oh, he wounded me.

**Speaker C:** Oh, he hurt me. Oh, I'm going to get him back.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to retaliate. I'm going to take revenge.

**Speaker C:** There's also the possibility that if somebody.

**Speaker A:** Feels unhappy and miserable They will have.

**Speaker C:** A pity party and they want you.

**Speaker A:** To join their pity party.

**Speaker C:** Misery loves company. So when we give the advice of don't worry, be happy, they say, oh, I can't, I, I have to worry, I've been worried all my life and I want to continue to worry.

**Speaker A:** They want you to believe them rather.

**Speaker C:** Than being frivolous and saying don't worry, be happy. When worry thoughts come up, just drop them. Because that's in fact what the teaching.

**Speaker A:** Of the Buddha is really all about, is to see what's real by observation, and mostly especially understand that your own thoughts are often unreal. They're unwholesome. Our feelings are often unwholesome.

**Speaker C:** Our attitude is almost always the attitude.

**Speaker A:** Of a victim, which is unwholesome.

**Speaker C:** What do I mean by a victim's attitude? That, oh, when we see what's on.

**Speaker A:** Television, that television sucks us in. We're victims of the television. We're victims of other people's feelings.

**Speaker C:** We're victims in the sense that we want help, we need help, I can't.

**Speaker A:** Do it on my own. That's 99% of the reasons why people are on Discord. Is because they want somebody to fix them, because they don't feel correct all by themselves. So the teaching of the Buddha, basically we can say, is based upon the Four Noble Truths. And we've been talking quite a bit today about the First Noble Truth, that there is bad feelings, there is discomfort, there is disatisfaction.

**Speaker C:** And it comes from many places, but mostly it's made up inside of our own mind. This is where it comes from.

**Speaker A:** The Second Noble Truth is that it's your own greed, your own desires, your own, um, uh, disliking, and it's your own confusion. It's your own ignorance, it's your own delusional systems that actually impact you and bring up feelings. And they mostly just made it up through the input of the cell phone.

**Speaker C:** Instead of seeing the whole reality that.

**Speaker A:** You'Re in, you get focused on a little piece of it, the cell phone.

**Speaker C:** And then you think that the cell phone is all of your reality.

**Speaker A:** For the moment, and that we can broaden our scope. We can draw back from that cell phone.

**Speaker C:** When the cell phone is really close, it's a tragedy. When it's, um, a half a world away— what's happening, I live in Thailand, and so the stuff that happens in the United States is pretty far away, which means it's quite a show for me is actually quite entertaining. It's a comedy.

**Speaker A:** It's not real.

**Speaker C:** And so unless you're actually living, let us say, in the White House, or if the story is about New York, unless you're actually living in that tower, then it's far away. Everything that you see in the news is actually someplace else. It's not here. So don't make it close.

**Speaker A:** That's a delusion.

**Speaker C:** Let it be far away so that it's not dangerous. For instance, a lion that's rustling in the grass right behind you is dangerous, but the lion that you see standing on top of the mountain, he's not dangerous. He's too far away.

**Speaker A:** And so if we can begin to.

**Speaker C:** Get distance from all of these events and all of these things that are happening, if we can get away from.

**Speaker A:** It mentally, if we can actually look.

**Speaker C:** And see that we're not close to.

**Speaker A:** It at all, we're actually quite far.

**Speaker C:** Away from it, then it really is not distant.

**Speaker A:** It's not here, it's someplace else.

**Speaker C:** So why should Michelle, we feel afraid. Why should we feel afraid when that stuff is not close at all? It's far away. Donald Trump is not there in the room that you're in fussing at you. Okay, so this is the way of looking at it, is begin— is actually beginning to observe, beginning to see that almost all the stuff that you feel bad about is because you've made the mistake of drawing it in and making.

**Speaker A:** It close to you.

**Speaker C:** That's why it's unwholesome, is because it's not really real.

**Speaker A:** And so this is what we mean.

**Speaker C:** Then by an unwholesome thought and an unwholesome attitude.

**Speaker A:** The attitude is, I'm a victim, and.

**Speaker C:** The thought is, oh, it's dangerous what's happening.

**Speaker A:** And then That's where the fear, the.

**Speaker C:** Anxiety, the craving comes in, is because of these ignorant feelings that we have. And so if we wise up so that what contacts us is contacted wisely, that means that now we have a choice about how we want to feel. If you see things at a great big distance, then it's just entertaining, it's just part of the show. It's a comedy. But if it's— if we perceive it, if our perception is, is that it's very close to us, then it's going to be dangerous. Just like the snake that we see that's in a tree that's 50 meters or 100 meters from here, that snake is not dangerous. But the snake that you're about to.

**Speaker A:** Step on, that's dangerous.

**Speaker C:** So this is the way that we can begin to see things, is let.

**Speaker A:** Everything be distant from you.

**Speaker C:** Begin to observe that in fact the reality is, is most of this stuff really is distant. Let's take an observation and recognize that.

**Speaker A:** The unwholesome thoughts that we are having.

**Speaker C:** Is because we have misperceived the closeness and the real danger.

**Speaker A:** But if we keep looking keep observing, keep noticing, then we'll recognize that actually.

**Speaker C:** I'm okay right now. How about you, Michelle? Is there any Donald Trumps in the room you're in? Are there any Vladimir Putins? How about alligators, huh?

**Speaker D:** No, but I mean, they're in your mind, huh? Well, some of the policy changes have affected my life. But I get you, what you're saying. Like, I still have shelter, I still have— like, I'm safe in this, in this very moment. I'm safe.

**Speaker C:** All right, let's say it like this then. You were on Social Security and now you didn't get your Social Security check. Is that a reason to feel bad? Because here's the thing about the Social Security check: you can't eat that Social Security check. You're probably going to be all right. Even if you don't get the Social Security check, which means now you can happily deal with reestablishing the Social Security check rather than having to do the work while you're feeling bad, full of fear, trepidation, anguish, despair. So this means then that what you can do is if you can get yourself into a happy state, then you can go do the things that you want and you need to do, but you can go do them happily. Yes, but the danger is still far away. That's the way to look at it, is that yes, some of the things that the government is doing is going to affect you, but it really is more an affection of your mind. What they do is going to more affect your mind than your actual reality. So all those people that were in Vermont protesting against, uh, JD Vance, they could have said, hey, JD Vance is in town, so what? He's not bothering me right now. But yet they were all out on that thing, and all of them in that protest were feeling bad right then and there. And guess what? They did not change J.D. Vance's opinion at all. They were under the delusion that if I yell at him enough and hold up a big enough sign, I can get him to change. And you're not going to change. What we need to do is recognize we in fact can't make those changes on the outside. The only thing that we can do is change our own inside, so that we can begin to feel good about no matter what happens. Another example with that would be J.D. Vance is not in the room you're.

**Speaker B:** In.

**Speaker C:** And if he were, he probably wouldn't be able to take any bad actions. He has to go back to Washington to make a mess. So if we can recognize then that the things that we are told that are so terrible and so bad, we buy into it. And we're buying into a lot of stuff that comes from the outside instead of just sitting and relaxing and saying, wow, right now everything is okay, right now Michelle, you're okay.

**Speaker A:** There are no politicians, there are no.

**Speaker C:** Snakes, there are no tigers, there are.

**Speaker A:** No Putins, there are no Trumps in the room you're in.

**Speaker C:** Wow, what a relief! What a relief it is to come back to reality, to see that those things are far away. They're not close. And if we can do that, then we can say, never mind that stuff. And so anytime that you begin to think about a politician and begin to feel bad about what he's doing, you can say, hey, right now I don't have to feel bad about it, because if I'm feeling bad about it, it's not going to change that politician. Let me make the changes inside. Let me have a good happy thought about right now. Everything is okay. The future will take care of itself.

**Speaker A:** And here's why.

**Speaker C:** No matter what happens in the future, if you can train yourself now to feel good and you have control over the way you feel, then whatever happens in the future, you can handle that and say, I can feel good when that happens. What we do instead is say, oh no, if that happens, it's a disaster. I'll feel bad when it happens, and I'll feel bad now thinking about it. And so in fact, we go around feeling bad about a lot of stuff that never happens. Most of the problems that you've ever had in your life didn't happen in reality. They only happened in our own mind.

**Speaker A:** The what-ifs.

**Speaker C:** And then we check it out and we say, oh, nothing to it. And so this is where we can begin to handle those feelings, is by looking closely at the thoughts, the feelings, and the attitudes that we have. And also look at the body in the sense that when we have these attitudes, when we have these thoughts and feelings, the body gets all tensed up. Anger and fear are actually, um, bodily things in the sense of, um, uh, fight or flight.

**Speaker A:** All right, to be able to fight.

**Speaker C:** To be able to flee, requires energy. It requires adrenaline.

**Speaker A:** And so we normally are going around.

**Speaker C:** Leaking adrenaline all the time, which keeps us uptight, tense. It keeps us stressed out. It keeps us, uh, in a let us say, a lingering chronic low-grade, um, anxiety, that every negative, every unhappy thought.

**Speaker A:** Every unwholesome thought will leak a little drop of adrenaline.

**Speaker C:** And every happy thought, every okay wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Thought will leak a little bit of dopamine.

**Speaker C:** Which would you rather have, a leaky faucet of adrenaline or a leaky faucet of dopamine? Your choice. That's the brilliant part, is that we've got a choice about this. Now, most people are so ingrained in the habit of having thoughts, unwholesome thoughts, fearful feelings, victim's attitude, with a body that's stressed out. We get into the habit, we do it so much over and over and over again that when people hear that, oh, you can change, they say, oh, it's hard. Oh, I'll try, but I don't think that I'll be successful. Well, that's just another unwholesome thought. If we could see that those are unwholesome thoughts, it's just part of our habit pattern. We can say, wait a minute, I don't have to have that thought. I can have a thought of I can get over that. I can have the thought that no matter how bad I feel, no matter what kind of negative thoughts I have.

**Speaker A:** I can stop them and come back.

**Speaker C:** To reality, see things the way that they really are, and be okay with it. That's the way to practice over and over again. In fact, that's the Eightfold Noble Path right there. Sati, to remember, to look, and then to look. Now, uh, we probably all heard about the Buddha has a thing called wrong.

**Speaker A:** View and right view, but, uh, noble.

**Speaker C:** Is not a noun, it's not a view, it's not an attitude, it's not a.

**Speaker A:** Um, a concept of worldview.

**Speaker C:** But it really is a verb saying, 'I can see, I can look.' It's a verb.

**Speaker A:** I'm looking, I'm looking at reality.

**Speaker C:** And if you have right noble viewing and look to see what's going on, you can see then that the thoughts.

**Speaker A:** That you're having are unwholesome.

**Speaker C:** The attitude that we have is of.

**Speaker A:** The victim's attitude, and that these unwholesome.

**Speaker C:** Thoughts and a victim's attitude winds up.

**Speaker A:** Giving us feelings, which are basically either dopamine or adrenaline. Your choice.

**Speaker C:** If we can make a change— we.

**Speaker A:** Need to be able to make a.

**Speaker C:** Change, and we can only see— make a change if we can see that the thought that we're having right now is unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Let's change that to a wholesome thought.

**Speaker C:** Ivan, you got your hand up. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Uh, sometime late, uh, every time I remember to look, I already feel wholesome. Like, it's almost like a kill lately.

**Speaker C:** Like, well, you're getting fast at it. Yeah, yeah, you're getting fast. As soon as you recognize, oh, this is an unwholesome thought, We can say that happily. Oh wow, I see that unwholesome thought. Oh wow, I see that fearful thing. I can see that fear. We can see the fear happily. You see, normally when we see feelings, when we see fear, when we see aversion, we see— and in fact, even if we like something, we want it. It's desire, it's clinging, it's craving. And when we can see the craving, when we can see our resistance, when we can see our fear, let's see those things happily. Oh wow, I feel fearful. Well, I'm glad I caught it. If I hadn't caught my fear, I would have remained fearful. And that's almost an instantaneous change. To change those thoughts means that little valves in the brain change.

**Speaker A:** Uh, this.

**Speaker C:** Is in the amygdala and in the pituitary and pineal glands that control the.

**Speaker A:** Way that we feel. And we can turn those negative chemicals.

**Speaker C:** Off and turn new ones on quite easily in the brain. It's the attitude that I can't change that prevents us from actually changing those faucets from hot to cold. And so, um, Ivan, congratulations, you're getting quick at it to be able to see— aha, I see that fear! If we can say, aha, I see that fear, we've already started dealing with it correctly, just by being able to see it. And then we can say, guess what, there's really nothing to fear. Vladimir Putin is not in the house. He's in Moscow, and that's a long.

**Speaker A:** Way from here, and he's got his own problems.

**Speaker C:** Let him deal with his problems, and I'll deal with the fact that I don't have any.

**Speaker A:** And so we can make that change quickly, instantly.

**Speaker C:** So congratulations that you're getting pretty good at this, Ivan.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's all— it feels really nice because back then I had the thoughts of, oh, I have to sit for 30 minutes and all those, like, it's like really complicated. I mean, I still meditate, but it's like I don't have to rely on.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker E:** To make myself feel good. It's like I remember I can, I'm already okay, which is, yeah. Thank you, Dhamma.

**Speaker C:** So basically, there's another point to it, and that is, is that when we get stuck in craving, when we really want something, we've got it on the mind, we have thoughts about it over and over and again, and we don't look to see that we've created ourselves a state of unhappiness and disappointment because we don't have what we want. You could also say it like this, that when you are okay, you're whole, you don't want anything.

**Speaker A:** But if you want something, if you're.

**Speaker C:** Craving something, if you're delighted in something and want it to continue, or it's gone now, then the craving means that I want it, means actually that now I have a hole in me. I'm not whole anymore. I would be better off if I had that which I'm craving. If we could see that in fact our craving creates a hole in us, and that hole, by the way, is just the size of that item. So if I crave a bicycle, that means I've got a bicycle-shaped hole inside, and that bicycle will come right in and fill that hole, right? That's the way that we can look at it, is that we have a hole.

**Speaker A:** We're not complete because we're wanting something.

**Speaker C:** That we don't have. If we can see that— aha, I see that I crave that then we can say, aha, I'm already whole even if I don't have what I want. So if we've missed the Social Security check and we're craving that we get.

**Speaker A:** The Social Security check, or we're craving.

**Speaker C:** That payroll check, or whatever it is, then we're miserable. We've got a payroll check hole inside of us, and we think that that payroll check then is going to fill that hole. And the reality is, is that we made that whole up. We don't need that payroll check to feel good. That whatever bad thing is going to happen because the payroll check didn't come is probably way off in the distance. Let's keep it off in the distance. Let's say I can handle no payroll check when it actually affects me. Right now, the only effecting that it has is that I'm feeling bad because I think about that I didn't get the payroll check. So we can deal with what we need to deal with, but we can deal with it happily without having to deal with it with trepidation and fear.

**Speaker A:** And disgust, anguish, despair. We can see all of that stuff.

**Speaker C:** Any Anicca, I see anguish, and I be anguished. If we can see that despair, we can say, 'Aha, I see that I'm depressed,' and we can come out of that depression simply by changing our attitude about it. 'Yeah, I'm depressed, so what? I'm okay with it even if I'm depressed, and I'll have depressing thoughts again, but I'll catch them, I'll see them, and I can cackle with joy when I do see my thoughts and feelings of being depressed, being sad, being angry.'.

**Speaker A:** Being uptight.

**Speaker C:** Ben, you're going to check out, huh? All right, so, uh, Simon, what do you think about what we're talking about?

**Speaker F:** It's great. Um, have a question though.

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker F:** If I catch a thought, but I'm having trouble changing my mind right away.

**Speaker C:** No, you don't have trouble changing your mind. That's a thought. Oh, I'm having trouble changing my mind. Can you see that thought? It's just another unwholesome thought. Say, aha, I see that thought. Oh, it's hard to change my mind.

**Speaker D:** Gotcha, gotcha.

**Speaker C:** If I can see that thought, aha, I see the thought, it's hard to change my mind. Guess what you just did? You changed your mind from, oh, poor me, I can't change my thoughts, into, aha, I see that I have just changed my thoughts because I've changed my attitude about the thoughts that I'm having. Aha, I see you, Mara, is what the Buddha said. Aha, I can see the thought of, oh, it's so hard. Oh, I can't change my mind. That's common. Everybody starts with thoughts like that. But you can in fact change. This is actually an easy practice. It is so easy to do that we get immediate results when we do it. But then we got to do it again because we're in the habit of feeling bad. We're in the habit of, I can't change my thoughts. And so we need to start looking to see those thoughts rather than just letting them spin on, oh, I can't, oh, this is hard, oh, I need my Social Security, oh, Donald Oh, Trump's terrible. Oh, there's a war in Ukraine.

**Speaker A:** Oh, poor me.

**Speaker C:** Life sucks. Oh, everything is terrible. And we just drone on and on and on with that stuff without actually taking a look and recognizing that, oh, that's just a habit pattern that I've developed. Let me have a new habit pattern. Let me change that stuff. I can change it from being, uh, feeling bad into saying, 'Aha, I see that I'm feeling bad,' and immediately we're making a change. 'Wow, I am so glad that I saw that. Well, I'm so happy right now I don't have to feel bad.'.

**Speaker A:** But we have to keep doing that over and over and over again.

**Speaker C:** This is why I would say that the almost the entire teachings of the Buddha is on the back of a shampoo bottle. Every shampoo bottle is on the shampoo bottles at 7-Eleven. It's on the shampoo bottles at, uh, Piggly Wiggly and Safeway, uh, Aldi's, whatever grocery store that you go to. You find the shampoo bottles and they have the entire teachings of the Buddha right there on the bottle. And what is that? The shampoo bottle gives you the Dharma of rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Rinse your mind out and then repeat rinsing your mind out. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. That's the, um, the story of the shampoo bottle. So we can give ourselves another rinse. Aha, I see you! And then we have to do it again. Aha, I see you! Aha, I see you, negative thought! And as we do that, we begin to interrupt those mental patterns.

**Speaker A:** So that.

**Speaker C:** We have them less often, and you have more often the thought of, 'Aha, I see that. Oh wow, what a relief it is I don't have to go down that path anymore.' Then we can start to have a little series of really wholesome thoughts like no place to go and nothing to do The spring comes and the grass grows all by itself. Wow, there's no place to go. Everything is okay right now. Wow, what a nice moment this is. And then I can take a deep breath. Oh, oh, what a relax. Just relax. Everything is okay. But we need to practice that over.

**Speaker A:** And over and over and over again.

**Speaker C:** And if the thought comes Why do the negative thoughts keep coming back? That's just another negative thought. That's just another unwholesome thought. That 'I want permanent relief'— we're not.

**Speaker A:** Going to get permanent relief.

**Speaker C:** Then in fact, 'I want permanent relief'.

**Speaker A:** Is actually just another unwholesome thought.

**Speaker C:** And so when you see yourself, 'Well, I wish I didn't have this problem,' we say, 'Aha, I see that.' I see that I'm messing up again. I'm trying to talk myself down by saying that things are not good enough right now. So this is the way that we practice. What do you think, Michelle?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's very helpful. I mean, I have a lot— yeah, I mean, I think ultimately it's like a pattern, right? It's a habit, this worrying and fear. It's like a habit that— and it kind of— I mean, I've heard you say this on a previous talk, but it's all kind of coming from this, like, the essential fear, like a fear of death, right? Or a fear of annihilation. And I guess if I'm honest, I don't really know how to deal with that fear.

**Speaker C:** You deal with it by saying, "I see it. I see that fear." Okay, because that changes our attitude right then and there. I see it. Aha, I could see that fear. And sort of instead of saying, I don't know how to deal with it— that's what all the beginners say, oh, I don't know how to do this, oh, it's so hard. And the answer to that is, aha, I can see that thought that I'm making it hard because I've been making things hard my whole life. That's just a pattern. That's just a habit of making things hard, when in fact I can make them easy just by saying, "Aha, I see that thought." But we have to practice, and I would recommend people take time out throughout the day. You've heard about people who meditate, oh, they sit for an hour, mostly they're thinking and they're rehearsing their bad feelings. Most of the Westerners who practice meditation actually make their life worse.

**Speaker A:** Because they're.

**Speaker C:** Not actually seeing those feelings and then changing them. They don't come to, oh, never mind, be happy, don't worry, be happy, everything is all right. And so they sit in meditation saying, oh, I wish the bell would ring. Oh, I'm too uncomfortable because the bell is so— oh, where's the bell? I want it to ring. And I got to sit here in meditation waiting for the bell to ring instead of, wow, right now I have nothing to do. I could sit here and just enjoy my moment, and when the bell rings, that's okay. And so this is the problem with Western meditation systems, is that they are not trained to make that change, to take in right noble effort to make a change, to really look at the kind of thoughts that we're having. The Mahasi system, the Western Mahasi system, talks about noting— to note your feelings, note your thoughts. And that's not what the Buddha teaches at all. He doesn't teach noting, he teaches change. To note it and fix it. Let me give you this little example. Imagine that you're walking down the sidewalk and you see a dog turd right.

**Speaker A:** There in front of you.

**Speaker C:** What are you going to do with it? The right thing to do would be just to step around it. So the right thing to do with those negative thoughts is just step around them. But many meditation systems, the two big ones would be what they call choiceless awareness, which means I see that dog turd, but I'm going to step right in it. I'm not going to change my gait. I'm just going to go plow right.

**Speaker A:** Through and get dog doo all over me.

**Speaker C:** But the Mahasi system is different than that. The Mahasi system wants us to pick up that dog turd, take it into the kitchen, powder it, fry it, um, uh, garlic it, put stuff on it, and make a great big shit pie. And then they eat it. All right, that's what the— that's what noting does, is you keep noting the Dukkha, noting the unhappiness, and we don't actually get out of its way. We don't make that change. And so the Mahasi system will note, oh, I feel bad, oh, I can't change. Yeah, I'm right, I can't change. All my life sucks because I can't change. You'd be better off if you didn't even think about it, didn't even see those thoughts. Just let them roll, at least for an ordinary person then. But if you get caught in this Mahasi system— they're the ones, by the way, that talk about having a dark night of the soul. That's because they fill their life with.

**Speaker A:** The thoughts of dukkha.

**Speaker C:** They're not making a change. So I recommend that when you see.

**Speaker A:** Those negative thoughts, those unwholesome thoughts, those.

**Speaker C:** Thoughts of I can't change, those thoughts of wow, this is really screwy, really dangerous— instead of changing, they get stuck in it. But we have an opportunity to change. So when those fears come up, we can say, aha, I see that fear. Aha, I can see it. And so start looking at the fear as a toy to play with.

**Speaker A:** Not.

**Speaker C:** Something to avoid, but just a new toy. I see that fear come up. When you see the craving, Simon, you can say, aha, I see that craving. I'm okay without whatever it is that I want. Let me just relax and be happy right now and stop thinking about what I want. That wanting something you don't have is Dukkha. It's one of the direct specifications.

**Speaker A:** Is.

**Speaker C:** Wanting something you don't have. Well, that wanting is craving. You're only an inch away from full Dukkha. And if you can see I want something and you don't have it, you can say, aha, I'm okay right now even if I don't have what I want. Edward, do you have any comments to make?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, um, isn't aha, I see you, a form of noting?

**Speaker C:** No, it's a form of change. It happened right after you noted it.

**Speaker F:** Like, aha, fear.

**Speaker C:** Aha, I see that fear is because you've already seen it, you've already noted.

**Speaker A:** It, you've already taken note of it.

**Speaker C:** And so the next thing we do after we see it and note it is to change it.

**Speaker F:** Okay, so see it, note it, and then change it by what?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker C:** Aha, I see you. And then that, you can follow that with, but I'm okay, I'm all right. Wow, what a relief it is. I do not have to feel like that thing exists.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the key word there is aha. It's congratulatory. It's like, hooray, I see that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, wow, I'm so happy I can see how afraid I am.

**Speaker F:** So the noting in this case would have the change because you have the energetic, uh, like, aha.

**Speaker C:** You really changed it to wholesome. And by the way, that's also a change of attitude, a change of attitude.

**Speaker A:** Of poor me, I'm afraid into, aha.

**Speaker C:** I can see that fear. Because in fact, you are not the fear. And so you can say, I see the fear. And you can say that then by changing that attitude of being an attitude.

**Speaker A:** Of a victim who is fearful into.

**Speaker C:** The attitude of being a champion, that you've seen that fear and you have, by seeing it, changed it. You've conquered it. Santiago, go ahead. Oh yeah, I was gonna say, it's like when you use the imagery about making the shit pie, it's like, aha, I don't gotta put on a bib and pull out the fork and the knife. I don't have to eat this stuff. Exactly, exactly correct. Samatha, do you have a comment?

**Speaker D:** No, I guess not.

**Speaker A:** All right, I like that little chuckle at the end.

**Speaker C:** That's the important thing, is to have that chuckle. I don't have anything to say. All right, Michael Swift, how do you think? What's your idea? Um, I don't think anything.

**Speaker A:** Not sure. Aha. Okay, not sure.

**Speaker C:** No, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** This was a very good talk.

**Speaker C:** All right, does anybody else have anything to say? All right, Mikey, why don't we take this thing home?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so again, please go ahead and visit the Dharma Friends Discord to keep in touch with us as Skype begins to shut down. And please send a friend request to myself and Dhammarato. If you are having any issues with getting things set up on Discord, you can also reach us via Open Sangha Foundation or send an email to Dhammarato.

And yeah, we're always welcoming new volunteers as well. So thank you, everyone.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Thank you all for coming. I'm really glad to see you.

**Speaker C:** And Ivan, especially to you, congratulations.

**Speaker A:** You're really making some good progress.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato. All right, so we'll see you. Bye everybody.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Bye.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.


### Summary

Based on the transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk led by Dhammarato:

**Core Theme:** The talk focuses on how we generate **fear, anxiety, and craving** by misperceiving media and external events as immediate, personal threats, and how to use Buddhist practice to break this habit.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Process of Suffering (Paticcasamuppada):** Fear and craving are late-stage results (steps 7-9) in the chain of dependent origination. They arise not from raw sensory data (sights/sounds), but from our **mental processing** (*nama-rupa*, *salayatana*). We interpret images (e.g., a politician on screen) through memory and concepts, creating a "story" that triggers instinctual feelings.

2.  **The Evolutionary Mismatch:** Our **self-preservation instinct** (e.g., fear of rustling grass) was evolutionarily advantageous but is now misfiring. Modern media (news, social media) exploits this by creating constant "false positives"—presenting distant, processed information as imminent dangers to keep us engaged. We react to a news image as if the threat were in the room.

3.  **The Fundamental Error: Making the Distant Feel Close.** We confuse the **small, mediated reality** on our screens (the "tragedy") with our **broader, actual reality** (the safe room we're in, which is the "comedy" from a distance). This creates a victim mentality and chronic low-grade anxiety.

4.  **The Practical Solution: The "Aha!" Practice of Seeing and Changing.**
    *   **Step 1 - See It:** Use mindfulness (*sati*) to catch the unwholesome thought, fear, or craving as it arises. *"Aha, I see that fear!"*
    *   **Step 2 - Change the Attitude:** Immediately change your relationship to it. Congratulate yourself for seeing it. Recognize you are not the fear; you are the one observing it. This shifts you from a **victim** to a **champion**.
    *   **Step 3 - Recontextualize:** Put the trigger in its proper place. Remind yourself: *"This politician/snake/news event is not in my room. It is far away. I am safe right now."*
    *   **Step 4 - Rinse and Repeat:** This is a habit-retraining practice. Like the instructions on a shampoo bottle, you must "rinse and repeat" constantly to weaken old neural pathways of reactivity.

5.  **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome:** Unwholesome states are characterized by a victim attitude, believing stressful thoughts are real and close, and leaking adrenaline. Wholesome states come from seeing reality clearly, knowing you can choose your attitude, and cultivating a sense of present-moment safety, which "leaks dopamine."

6.  **Specific Advice:**
    *   **For Beginners:** Consider drastically reducing news consumption. You'll hear about truly important events anyway. Avoid "blow-by-blow" coverage that amplifies fear.
    *   **On Meditation:** Critiques styles (like some Western "noting" practices) that dwell on negative states without actively changing attitude. The goal isn't just to note suffering, but to see it and skillfully let it go or change your relationship to it.
    *   **On Craving:** Seeing craving creates a sense of lack or a "hole." The practice is to see the craving and realize, *"I am already whole without that thing."*

**Conclusion:** The path is about **empowerment through observation**. By repeatedly seeing our unwholesome mental habits and choosing to re-frame our perception—drawing back to see the bigger, safer picture—we can stop "sucking" on manufactured fears and discover that we are already okay in the present moment. The transition is simple but requires persistent practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the talk uses several key metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and how to deal with fear and craving. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors:**

1.  **The Snake (and the Politician):** This is the central metaphor.
    *   **The Coiled Snake:** When you see a coiled shape, your mind *processes* it into "snake" based on memory, triggering fear. The speaker argues we do the same with images of politicians on screens—we process a neutral image into a fearful concept ("snake").
    *   **The Picture of a Snake vs. a Real Snake:** This extends the metaphor to modern media. Getting upset by a news report is likened to being afraid of a *photograph* of a snake, mistaking the paper/image for reality. The danger isn't present in your room.

2.  **The Rustle in the Grass (Evolutionary Fear):** This is a story/metaphor for why fear is instinctual.
    *   **The Story:** Two ancient humans hear a rustle. One runs (fear/false positive), the other turns to look (curiosity) and gets eaten. Natural selection favored those with a quick fear response to ambiguous threats.
    *   **The Metaphor:** Our modern anxiety over news is a **"false positive"** from this ancient wiring. We react to media "rustles" (alarming headlines) as if they were immediate physical threats (a leopard), even though they are distant and processed.

3.  **Sucking / Slurping (The Source of Suffering):**
    *   The phrase "life sucks" is reframed: **"Life sucks only because we're sucking."** We "suck" or "slurp" on external things (news, desires, opinions) hoping they will bring security, which creates internal lack and anxiety. If we stop "sucking," we realize we are already safe.

4.  **The Boxing Match / Blow-by-Blow News:**
    *   News media is compared to a **blow-by-blow radio broadcast of a 15-round boxing match**. Reacting to each punch (every news update) as if it's the final outcome creates emotional whiplash. The wise approach is to **wait for the final result** (or recognize you may never know it), staying emotionally detached from the intermediate "punches."

5.  **Tragedy vs. Comedy (Psychological Distance):**
    *   **"What we see up close is tragedy. But when seen from a distance, it's comedy."** This metaphor advises creating **psychological distance** from problems. A political crisis in another country is a "tragedy" for those involved but can be seen as a distant "comedy" or drama by an observer. The practice is to mentally place anxieties "far away" where they lose their power.

6.  **The Hole and the Object (Nature of Craving):**
    *   Craving is pictured as **carving a hole inside yourself** that is the exact shape of the thing you want (e.g., a bicycle-shaped hole). You believe only that object can fill it. The insight is that **the hole itself is the problem you created**; you were already whole without the object.

7.  **The Leaky Faucet (Neurochemistry of Thought):**
    *   Unwholesome thoughts are likened to a **leaky faucet dripping adrenaline** (causing stress). Wholesome thoughts are a **leaky faucet dripping dopamine** (causing well-being). You have the choice to "change the faucet" by changing your thoughts.

8.  **The Dog Turd on the Sidewalk (How to Handle Negative Thoughts):**
    *   This story critiques other meditation styles:
        *   **The Right Way (The Buddha's Way):** See the dog turd (negative thought) and simply **step around it** (let it go, change focus).
        *   **"Choiceless Awareness" (Wrong Way):** See the turd and **plow right through it** (dwell in the negativity without change).
        *   **"Noting" Meditation/Mahasi Style (Critiqued as Worst):** See the turd, **pick it up, take it to the kitchen, and make a "shit pie"** (obsessively note and analyze the negativity until you consume and are defined by it—leading to the "dark night of the soul").

### **Supporting Analogies & Stories:**

*   **The Shampoo Bottle Dharma:** The entire teaching is summarized as **"Rinse and Repeat"**—constantly rinsing the mind of unwholesome thoughts and repeating the process.
*   **The Lion on the Mountain:** A lion far away on a mountain isn't a threat. This reinforces the **"tragedy vs. comedy"** metaphor—keep threats at a mental distance.
*   **The Radio Sportscaster with a Bias:** Like a biased boxing commentator, news anchors and people in our lives present **their spun version** of reality to elicit a specific emotional response (fear, anger, pity) from us.
*   **"If it bleeds, it leads":** A journalistic adage used to explain why media focuses on fear—it captures attention, which sells.

**In summary,** the speaker uses the **Snake** metaphor to explain how perception creates fear, the **Rustle in the Grass** story to explain its evolutionary origin, and the **Boxing Match** and **Tragedy/Comedy** metaphors to teach detachment. The **Hole** and **Leaky Faucet** metaphors describe the mechanics of craving and thought, while the **Dog Turd** story vividly prescribes the correct method of release. All are framed by the simple, repetitive practice of the **Shampoo Bottle Dharma**.
