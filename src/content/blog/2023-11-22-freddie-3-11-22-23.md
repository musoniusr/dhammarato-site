### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, I wanted to talk a bit about being creative, for one. I don't know, there are a few things maybe, but yeah, and meditation, you know, composing. I don't know, I just haven't felt creative recently. I just thought, you know, I don't really hear about creativity from a Dharma perspective.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I would say offhand that most of the reason why the amount of literature in the Dharma is so vast, a whole bookshelf full of stuff. And that's just the Tripitaka, or the Tipitaka, or the Tathagata. It depends upon what country you're in as to how you pronounce it. The Three Baskets take a whole bookshelf, bookcase full of, full of books. And the reason for that was because the, uh, the old monks way back when were quite creative. The Buddha would have never figured out the path unless he was able to have that as an aspect of creativity, which is basically the art of research. By looking at something one direction and then another, and then another. Now, in music, I'll give you several examples of that. Have you ever heard of Steve Allen? Steve Allen ran The Night Show, or The Tonight Show, on television, uh, many, many years ago, like back in the 1950s.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like before Johnny Carson.

**Speaker B:** Before Johnny Carson, precisely. And that on one of his monologues, he was also quite a magician, and that he was talking about creativity. And so what he did was, he took a photo of a skyline of a city that had high-rise buildings, and he would then paint a note on each of the buildings, And then he played that on the piano, and that was a brand new song, right? Okay. Another way of thinking about it is, is that taking, um, all of Beethoven's music, you probably know, is because he is based upon a very short theme, that he doesn't have long extrapolated melodies, that it's just the same few notes over and over and over and over again. Okay, yeah, very— you can hear that in the Sixth Symphony, but the most obvious place is in the first movement of the Fifth Symphony. That's just— that's the whole symphony, it's a whole movement. Yeah, but he does it over and over and over and over and over again. And so creativity does not necessarily mean that it's got to be something big and complex. It can be something very simple, and that you build upon that or grow from it. But it also has a lot to do with confidence, that in fact, uh, what I'm mentioning now would be what is called writer's block. When they're working too hard to try to come up with the next paragraph, instead of just stopping and getting away from it, and having easy thoughts about it, and then an idea will come. And then they can expand upon that. So, creativity is in fact a kind of a letting go, as opposed to working it out or struggling with it. Edison had the concept that invention is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. You probably heard that. All right. Actually, the 'prespiration' part was when he was working too hard, and the 'inspiration' was all that it was. An example of that was when he was making the light bulb, the filaments kept burning out. And all he had to do was to come up with the right kind of filament in the right kind of atmosphere. And so he found out, I mean, by just experimenting, just by playing with it, He found that the filament had to be something that could get hot and stay hot and keep its shape. And then you put it into a gas that is what is called a noble gas. And he found— he actually experimented and found that argon was the gas, that even if you put it in carbon dioxide, if If the heat of the filament is too hot, it will break down the carbon into carbon dioxide, into oxygen, and then the oxygen that's freed up will eat the filament. And that if you put nitrogen in it, nitrogen is not a noble gas, and so nitrogen at high temperatures will interfere. So you had to come up with— that's so logical, but it took him so long because he was working too hard at it. And so the story about Beethoven is that he would often just go on a walk and just hum to himself, and that was how he would come up with his short melodies. Is just by walking, not trying to compose. If you're trying to compose, you'll have writer's block. You want something. But if you let your mind just wander easily, happily, it can come up with creativity. But when you say, oh no, I've got to be creative right now.

**Speaker A:** Then.

**Speaker B:** You'Re going to feel bad because you can't.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the creativity is, um, just like a natural thing.

**Speaker B:** Well, in a way, it's a kind of a freedom. And yet we think that we can put creativity in a box, we can force it. Many examples of this, like the scientist who is working out a mathematical problem and he can't get it, so he gets tired and he goes to sleep. Einstein was actually famous for this kind of stuff, that he, during the sleep or during the dream, or he would wake up with the solution. It was already there for him. Yeah, he just worked too hard to get it.

**Speaker A:** I'm finding that I can't really— I'm thinking about it like music, you know, all day, because I'm going into uni and stuff and, you know, getting lessons and stuff. And then I find, you know, I'm switching off at night, but then I'm like, when I'm going to bed, you know, trying to get to sleep, I just like, my mind is kind of going into this weird state of like, I don't know, just thinking about like tasks I have to do and notes, thinking about some melodies or like songs I've heard. So it's like, um, maybe that's going.

**Speaker B:** To be the source of your creativity. One of the famous things that they do, um, is play a song backwards, playing it in a different tempo.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Changing it from major to minor and playing with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Just, just experiment and playing with it rather than putting the pressure on yourself of you've got to come up with something.

**Speaker A:** Also, there's a struggle with like, struggle, there's a thing, a thought, but there's a thing with like, I don't know, I question the path of of like being a musician, you know, when I think about, you know, it will be just easier to just like probably just ordain or something like that. Oh, or I don't know, I just sometimes feel like, I don't know, maybe sometimes I think that I'm wasting my time, I guess, with it.

**Speaker B:** If you did ordain, then what?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, I don't think that would be good either, but I just think.

**Speaker B:** That— well, it might be that in fact ordination is something that.

**Speaker A:** For the.

**Speaker B:** Westerner it happens way too often of, oh, I've got to get away from this and that's my escape route. Yeah, yeah. In Thailand, many of the young men who become monks become monks because their family expects them to do it. It's part of the culture. But possibly the best way of all to do it is to come to the conclusion that what you've been doing is not fulfilling, but that has to come from real wisdom. The example would be that when somebody does not like their job, and they want to quit, that's not always a very good idea. In fact, it's almost never a good idea. But the right thing for them to do instead is learn to be happy and joyful on their own in seclusion, and then go and learn to do that job happily and joyfully. And after they learn to do the job happily and joyfully, then they can begin to see it with real wisdom, that they're no longer trying to escape from it. They can see that actually what it is. And then they begin to see all the job itself is not wholesome, right? Selling stuff is not a very wholesome profession.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Manufacturing of articles that people don't need. Is not a good profession. So that's the right time to ordain, is when you recognize that you've already gotten to the point of seeing that the world itself is not a good environment for anyone. But we can't see that because we are in fact seeing it from the position of I don't like it. Okay, so in the job that you're creating for yourself, the right thing to do is to get yourself into a happy mood first with the confidence, oh, I'll compose later because I really know how to do that and I'm really good at it. And then the melodies will come.

**Speaker A:** Because.

**Speaker B:** You'Ve got the background. But if you put pressure on yourself, oh, I've got to get this thing into the benefactor or to the Screen Guild or to the teacher or whoever it is, putting ourselves under pressure Yeah, that in fact that often happens with, uh, very, uh, let us say modern musicians who become celebrities, is that they learn to play with it. They're sitting in their bedroom and they come up with this riff, or they come up with this song or whatever like that, and it becomes famous. And then now they put their, the real pressure on themselves for side B. That's in the old days when you had 45s where you had one tune side A and another tune side B. But anyway, the point is, is that we, we put pressure on ourselves to come up with something just as creative as we came up with when now we're in a different mood. The same thing happens actually in meditation, in the sense that somebody is practicing correctly, they're relaxing, they're getting their mojo together, and they really get into a really good state. And then they go out of that meditation, they come back for meditation later, and now they've added a new ingredient. They remember what they did and they want it again. So now they've got great desire built into their practice of meditation, and that's why they're not having a good session this time, is because they're trying to repeat what happened in the last time. They put pressure on themselves, etc., like that, rather than coming back to the point of just relaxing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, just be in the moment.

**Speaker B:** So that's where a lot of the creativity is going to come from, is by not putting pressure on yourself.

**Speaker A:** Putting ease upon yourself, putting something else on yourself.

**Speaker B:** Right. You get really easygoing and then things will just pop up naturally.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I start something and then, um, just I won't be able to get past, you know, past it because it's, it's just, you mean I can hear like what I want, or like I have a kind of radar of this isn't powerful, you know. So yeah, and I sometimes I can get into being swift and creative. I think it's maybe just thinking about it, being surrounded by music. And yeah, um, it's just, it's, um, there is an element that I need to get good at, which is just that the environment seems to be a source of big pressure, you know, people and just assignments. And we're all talking about like, oh, have you started the thing for the competition, stuff like that? Because there's the thing we were writing for you know, orchestra basically. And there's just, you know, a lot— I'm just— go every— I just go to bed thinking about that, you know. And this is so bad because, I mean, when I was, you know, out of uni at home, I was like just so able to live that kind of simple Einstein life, you know, just go to sleep and then be able to just put something out, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, you were mentioning that you would get started on it and then you— and then you get stuck and you can't go any further, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, in that case, let's play the Beethoven game in the sense of, okay, you've gotten so far with it, what are we going to do now? We'll just repeat that. Speed up the tempo, give it various instruments, you know, like da da da da. That's all there is to that Fifth Symphony. But wow, look what he was able to do with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just repeating it over and over and over again. That in fact, this is much of what music is all about. Um, here's something just very interesting that a lot of people don't quite realize, and that is a tempo. Like, let us say 2 beats a second, all right? 120. If you double that and then double it again and then double it again, you've got a low C. And you double that again, you get a middle C, and double that again. And so tempo and tonality are the same thing, just at different frequencies.

**Speaker A:** Nice, I didn't know that actually. That's pretty cool.

**Speaker B:** And so, uh, playing with tempo, playing with syncopation, and then you can play with the tones also. That way. But you can just start with something very simple, like the Knuckle Song. I'm sure you know the Knuckle Song. It's all played on the pentatonic scale, the black keys. Oh right, yeah. See, it's a very simple thing.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. I think we call that chopsticks in England, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Right, well, chopsticks. There's chopsticks.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, I think I'm thinking of a different one. I think chopsticks is maybe different things. I'm thinking of the black piece. I thought that was Chopsticks.

**Speaker B:** Well, different words, but anyway, it's very simple music and the kids can learn to play. And the point of it is, is that if you're playing that kind of music and really enjoying yourself, then music can become your career. Yeah, but if mom buys a piano and sets you down with a teacher and now you've got to take piano lessons— yeah. That doesn't work.

**Speaker A:** I'm finding that with this experience as well, is like, I'm finding that a lot of the stuff that they're giving you, they just want you to feel like you're learning. So they're giving you history lessons, but it's just honestly, I mean, to get good at composing, you're not like— it's not going to help studying all these varied things, you know. So you should— you need to just be composing. So I find that, like, I need to just kind of stop going to some classes of just, you know, just— I feel like it's too much school. I'm becoming, like, schoolified. Yeah, I'm getting— I'm getting— I don't know what you call it. Like trained to be trained. So yeah, I think, um, maybe I need to kind of stop, just engage, just engage with myself a bit more. And that because I, I feel like there's also a kind of satisfaction in being in that kind of a university or school environment. You're around people and it's like you just feel kind of like your needs are kind of catered for. And you could just totally just stop thinking about your personal goals and just.

**Speaker B:** Be.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just amongst the— I don't know what you call it— hubbub. Hubbub, is that a word?

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure, but what I'm thinking is, is that school often gets very competitive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** There is an element of that, yes.

**Speaker A:** But it's a really great environment. Like, people are really nice and lovely. It's not competitive, but it's just, you know, it's just school. It's just going to class, whereas I feel what would be best if I have more time to kind of meditate, sleep enough, and then just write, and then you know, be healthy and stuff like that.

**Speaker B:** Learning to take it easy, because in fact school teaches us using language like you got to be on your toes, or you got to work, or do your homework, or put in that assignment, get into a hurry. I remember I was very, very much in a hurry when I was in high school. And part of it was that I was way too busy. I had a paper route, not just one paper route, but two. I had two paper routes, one with the Charlotte Observer and the other one was the Columbia, South Carolina State, and I delivered both of them. And get up at— in fact, what I would do is that I would play with my electronics and my recorded music and uh, ham radio and all of that, basically at night, all night. And then I would go deliver my papers, and then I would go to school to sleep.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** And I would sleep in school until about 2 in the afternoon, which is when band practice started.

**Speaker A:** What did you play?

**Speaker B:** Uh, in— well, uh, various things, but primarily this, the sousaphone, the tuba. I actually didn't get a tuba until I was studying in university. Before then, it was sousaphones.

**Speaker A:** Sousaphones? You mean the saxophone?

**Speaker B:** Sousaphone. John Philip Sousa. He took the, the tuba that they carried around on straps when they had marching bands in Europe. He unwrapped the thing and then found a way of wrapping it so it would sit on his shoulder and the bell would sit up here.

**Speaker A:** That's crazy. Oh man, I've never seen one of those, but I've like seen pictures.

**Speaker B:** They're used for marching bands, which we were. In fact, we were a championship marching band, state champion. Oh.

**Speaker A:** That's great. Were you assigned that instrument or did you choose that? Pardon? Like, were you given that instrument to play or did you kind of want to play that one?

**Speaker B:** Actually, that was the instrument my dad played in World War II.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** And it was not my instrument of choice, but I did kind of the best that I could with it. Now, when I got into the US Navy, Because the Navy does both marching bands, but primarily the bands on board ship out at sea. Back in the old days before the guys went around with headphones listening to their walkie-talkies or Walkmans or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** The only music that was available was live music. You guys live in a different world than I grew up in.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So to finish that part of the story about the Navy, was is that you had to be versatile in the Navy to play various instruments. So that if you were in a dance band, some of the guys would play a violin in the dance band, and then they'd play a saxophone out in the marching band. And the tuba players had to play string bass, but you can't take a string bass out marching. You just can't do it. Right, it's true. So, uh, but in the dance band they wanted me to play the, um, the string bass, which was kind of the downfall. But I had a, um, double bass. Very— yeah, you know, string bass, uh, the same thing as a bass guitar with, uh, 4 strings. On very rare occasions they'll have 5. With a very, very low C is the 5th string. Yeah, but normally it's a 4-stringed instrument. Yeah. And they're used with jazz for picking, but in concert they normally do it with a bow. Yeah, just like all the other string instruments. Okay, well then, in the Navy, when I was in the Navy, by the way, it was a long time ago, we're talking about back in the 1960s. But the Navy still hadn't gotten out of World War II. They were still stuck in World War II music, which would be like Jimmy Dorsey and that kind of stuff. Swing, they call it now. Yeah. Take the A Train, that kind of stuff. Okay. Which was all a lot of bass.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So would you be doing that? You'd be walking? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no. That's the whole point, is that you cannot carry a string bass and play it at the same time.

**Speaker A:** No, not back then.

**Speaker B:** Can't do that. And so basically what happened was, is that I, at those days, I didn't have the emotional maturity that I have now. But I had an out, and that was because I was really into electronics on my own. The Naval School of Music had a sound recording laboratory that was world-class. I mean, the best of Hollywood, we had that kind of equipment, but I had already had that kind of equipment, expensive tape machines. When I started with tape, the first one was actually a wire recorder right out of the 1940s. My uncle had it, and then my dad did tape recording and for the church so that they could record the sermons of the preachers. We're talking about back in the 1950s now. So I'd been around taping equipment all of that time, knowing all of the problems with tape the hissing noises, the bumps, what kind of tape you had, what speed you were playing with, whether you had single track at 15 inches per second or whatever, all of that stuff. So I was able to get into the sound recording laboratory and at the Naval School of Music because it was wartime. This was during Vietnam time, and all of the ETs, the electronic technicians they were out on battleships repairing the hardware. And so the Naval School of Music didn't have any pay billets for ETs. They had to be musicians. They had to be musicians that were not only interested in making music but also recording music. And so we had Neumann lathe. A lathe is what you actually cut the disc with. So we cut disc and things like this. Um, we also manufactured our own high-speed tape duplicating system so that you could take regular tape that ran at, say, 3¾ inch per second and run it at very, very high speed and make a copy of it at high speed. And then that high-speed tape would be back at the frequency of the original tape and still be good enough quality for ordinary people to tolerate. But we had to build the electronics so that they can handle those very, very high frequencies when we were running that tape at 10 times its normal speed. But that's how we manufactured tape so that we could give them out. We also had a lot of famous musicians. One was, in fact, I remember specifically Doc Holliday, who played the trumpet on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. And he would come down to the sound recording— actually, he'd come to the Naval School of Music and give trumpet lessons to the musicians. There was also another issue, and that is that all of the very high-quality musicians all over the place who were in schools like Juilliard and whatnot like that. And the recruiter comes knocking on the door with the draft notice. And nobody wants to go hold a gun in Vietnam. And so all the musicians joined the Navy so that they could be musicians in the Navy. And one of my best friends was a violinist from Juilliard. I remember walking down the hall with him while he was playing Beethoven's Concerto in D or Tchaikovsky. I was really impressed with him, but his bane was he had to learn the clarinet.

**Speaker A:** Because he had to go to the Navy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because he was in the Navy and the Navy does both the sitting down music of the dance bands where he could play the violin all he wanted, but when he's out marching, he had to carry an instrument that he could play while he was marching, and you cannot play a violin while you're marching. They do not have stringed instruments. They have only woodwind, brass, and percussion, okay, to go out marching. But anyway, I felt really inferior as a musician when I was in the Navy. Now, when I was in college, I was one of the good ones. I do anything because, you know, I was very good on the tuba, but when I had to pick up that string bass, being around other musicians who were really good also, and I felt really inadequate. And so I really jumped at the chance of going into the recording industry. And so that's when I kind of left music altogether as a musician and got into it in the recording end of it, um, right? And from there, when I got out of the Navy, guess who I got a job with? IBM, repairing computers.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** And so that was an interesting transition from music to electronics and music into high-speed electronics with computing and accounting machines and all of that kind of stuff. So that was my early career. But later, to round out the story, I began to figure out that I had been a musician because that's what my dad wanted me to be, that my real love was electronics and engineering and that kind of stuff, that he was the one who pushed me into music.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I was able to move out of that.

**Speaker A:** Did you enjoy music, like, as a person, from growing up to when you realized that it was your dad's thing?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I still actually enjoy music. Yeah, but I listen— but I listen to it from the sense of listening to the distortion, listening to missed notes. A good example of that would be the Rhapsody in Blue that I had a guy in high school who really wanted to play Rhapsody in Blue, but he didn't have an orchestra, but they had the score for the piano. So there was a piano backup that played the orchestra score, and I played the orchestra score for him playing Rhapsody in Blue. And we used to really practice. And so I know every note of Rhapsody in Blue.

**Speaker A:** On the piano?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, yeah, he— we were playing the piano. Yes, I had 7 years of piano lessons.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** Playing, uh, uh, well, I, I made a big mistake, as we all did, and that is that I was prematurely trying to play piano music that was over my head. Yeah, Flight of the Bumblebee, Revolutionary Etude. I mean, the hardest music in the world I was trying to play on the piano. But this guy that I had as a friend, he could actually play Rhapsody in Blue. And I know that piece, but it starts on the piano without a clarinet. So I know the whole thing. And that recently I was listening to some— actually, she was quite good because she enjoyed what she was doing. And this was on a video on YouTube, but she was making a lot of mistakes and she was just running right through them. And I bet nobody knew the mistakes that she was making because there's so many tritones and weird chords in Rhapsody in Blue, as Gershwin, you know, out of the '30s. And so I could catch that stuff. That's what I can listen to. That's what I can hear now is the technical quality of how good the music is. I would make a very good music critic if I were, you know, if this was 50, 60 years ago. But now modern music, I mean, 4 instruments is all they need and you've got a band.

**Speaker A:** So then how did you get into Buddhism and stuff after IBM? And I think it's a long story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was a long story because I started work with IBM in 1967 and I got really jealous of the— they had two different kinds of engineers. They had what they call customer engineers which went in to repair the hardware on site. And then there were system engineers who wrote software. And I wanted to become a systems engineer. I wanted to get into software. And so the opportunity came when my house burned down, when I was working for IBM. I'd been working for them for about 3 or 4 years. And I decided I'm going to go to university. I went back to the same university. University that I was studying music and was able to get my bachelor's degree in computer science in just 2 years because I'd had a lot of the basic stuff like English literature and that kind of stuff, history and all of that. So I had all of these credits built up, and so I only need another 60 credits or whatever. Yeah, so I was able to get my degree in 2 years and The funny part about it was that the Department of Mathematics had changed their catalog in those years in between, and so I had to repeat some of the courses that weren't in the catalog anymore, but they were in the old catalog. But that gave me the ability to get a double major in mathematics and computer science. Now, I started off as a musician, and in 4 years of college, wind up with a degree in double major in math and computer science. And then I went to University of Oklahoma and got a degree in engineering, in electrical engineering, and had been doing the software. Okay. And I got a job in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was a hippie community. Big time back in the day.

**Speaker A:** Is that the Stooges who lived in Ann Arbor? You know, the Stooges?

**Speaker B:** Oh, the Three Stooges? I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Like Iggy Pop. Iggy Pop.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's after my time, I think.

**Speaker A:** No, that was about the right time, I think. Are they from Ann Arbor? I think maybe Iggy Pop. I don't know. Yeah, sorry.

**Speaker B:** So I was doing database stuff in Ann Arbor and got very much interested in psychology. To be honest with you, I was into women, and that was a really easy place to find women, was because they had a really big school. The nursing school actually had degrees in psychiatric nursing. And so I took some classes there and also got very much into TA. And that's when I began to figure out really that I was unhappy. I was successful but unhappy. And so now I'm off studying psychology, getting so much into it that I get fired from my job. I think in fact it was It was Xerox Corporation, and actually we were using— no, the name of the company was SYSCOM, and we were using Xerox mainframe computers. So in great dejection, I lowered my standards and started teaching university. And so I was a college professor for a while.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And in those days— did you have a master's?

**Speaker A:** You had an undergrad and then you had a master's in engineering?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, master's in electrical engineering.

**Speaker A:** Wow. And how old are you around there, like 30?

**Speaker B:** No, you're talking about— well, yeah, 27, 28 years old by then.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And it was with the psychology that I got off into the really all that New Agey stuff. I went and spent a couple of weeks with the Indians on the Tuscarora Reservation. I knew a witch from Vladivostok who was living in Detroit. All— I mean, really heavy duty into the New Age. I went right to the bottom of it. And also there was an ashram there by a Swami named Muktananda. And so I stayed at the ashram, slept there, had a van teaching university in Detroit and had an interesting life. But I was still not satisfied. And that's when I went to India and I started on a magical mystery tour in India while I was back and forth teaching college and going to India. And eventually got into Goenka and stayed with Goenka for quite a while. And then I got dissatisfied with Goenka and started living in Bodh Gaya. You've probably heard of Bodh Gaya, that's where the Buddha became enlightened in India. And I met a monk there, a Thai monk, who told me that I got to go to Thailand to see Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And that, by the end, it was 1983. And so that's when I was there with Wat Soan Mook that I ordained as a monk. Okay, so that means that I have been fairly deeply into mathematics, into psychotherapy and psychology, into music, into hardware electronics, into programming. And now I go off into Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, into girls.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Into girls as well.

**Speaker B:** Well, I kind of got finished with that when I was in Ann Arbor. Had a lot of women, had, you know, got my fill of that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is the '60s, right?

**Speaker B:** No, this is— that was the '70s, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's still, still a bit, you know, polyamorous maybe these times. Punk rock.

**Speaker B:** I've had a very interesting life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's great. Detroit. Detroit Rock City.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was big Motown. Yeah, that was— you listen to Steve.

**Speaker A:** Khan on the radio? Oh wait, no, sorry, Steve Dahl. Steve Dahl.

**Speaker B:** No, the name doesn't sound familiar. Collins does.

**Speaker A:** He was like a rock— he was like a rock DJ in Detroit in the '70s. Yeah, but, uh, he had this thing about like he was anti, uh, like disco, and he had that— he created that slogan, Disco Sucks. And then they had this like, um, record burning of disco records.

**Speaker B:** Um, and that was like— oh, I remember that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, a lot of anti-war stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, but that was, that was just like, I think it was a kind of rebellion against disco. And at the time, maybe disco became um, uncool. Well, maybe it was never cool, but I don't know. I quite like disco myself.

**Speaker B:** There was a lot of racial stuff in the music back then, you know. Motown was all Black music. Yeah, and they made their own because Hollywood wouldn't, um, yeah, uh, wouldn't accept them.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, that was like disco as well. So there was, there was a racist element to it. Of— yeah, but anyway, that's very cool though. I like— that's a good arc of a life, I think.

**Speaker B:** Well, it was the evolution of figuring out that I was not getting what I was looking for out of all the stuff that I, uh, went into. Then it was only when I got into the Dhamma that I recognized that that's what I needed to be doing, which was a whole bunch of nothing, happily.

**Speaker A:** And did you find it quite easy to grasp the Dhamma? Or was it like very new?

**Speaker B:** Um, it was actually quite easy to fit it into the psychology, but I did very well with the psychology. Then in fact, I had gone far enough into psychology that I was almost at the PhD level in psychotherapy and psychology, where all of the other students had the big problem of if they get their PhD in psychology, how are they going to survive? Because it takes years to build up a practice. And that the insurance companies back then, major, was called Blue Cross Blue Shield in Michigan. They would not pay for it. This is why all the diagnostic codes were invented, just trying to legitimize psychotherapy to make it like the medical model so that the insurance companies would pay for it. They still haven't gotten that problem solved, but I recognized that, hey, I had a fallback because I can make money anytime that I want to through computers. I remember, in fact, when they were having trouble at Detroit Institute of Technology where I was there, that the college professors were worried Because if they lose their job, if they close the school, they're out of luck. And one of the professors, in fact, I remember them having a conversation with me, because they were jealous of me, that I could go to work for any place in anything. In fact, Burroughs Corporation, which was a major computer company, was in Detroit, and I had relationships with them and did some contract work and whatnot like that. And so I wasn't so tied to the university as many of the professors there, because that was all they had. I'd always found a way of having a back door or a way out or making it easy to get out of it. And I still wasn't satisfied, even though I'd found a way of having a very easy, happy life. I still wasn't satisfied. It was only when I'd gotten to watch someone, Moksha, that I really felt at home.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, do you think that having this varied life where you kind of tried everything, was that something that made learning the Dharma easier?

**Speaker B:** Or like, yes, that's what I'm saying, is that I apply electronics, I apply music, I apply martial arts, I apply all kinds of science.

**Speaker A:** But also I was thinking like, because you've you know, you lived in the world doing world-type things and jobs, that you have had more than a taste of it, that you never kind of— you felt done with that, and you felt like when you were ordained and stuff, you weren't thinking like, oh, what if I did this? Because you'd already done that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I remember one time when I was off in seclusion at the back of Wat Soan Mokkh that I was getting bored with nothing to do and no place to go and no books to read and nothing except me in the woods and the kuti that I lived in, and would reminisce about, well, I could go back to the States and make money. Then I would say, yeah, but I didn't want to do that when I was doing it. Why am I thinking about it now? And that's when it dawned upon me really hard. It really hit me. That the reason that I'm here and bored is because I'm not practicing correctly. Let me get my mind back together again. So that was a kind of a major revolution of stop trying to think about how can I get out of my crap? Because I've been trying to get out of my crap now for nearly 20 years and hadn't been able to get out of it. Now's the time to get out of it, to stop thinking that I can be better off someplace else and really get the fact that I've already got everything right here.

**Speaker A:** And you can still— I mean, I can apply that to here as well. I mean, you know, it's not like I have to be in seclusion.

**Speaker B:** No. What you have to do— there is physical seclusion, and then there is mental seclusion. A good example of that was Howard Hughes. Have you ever heard of Howard Hughes?

**Speaker A:** Is he the director?

**Speaker B:** No, he was a manufacturing wizard. He had an airplane company. He was quite rich. He owned hotels and things in Las Vegas, and he had just had enough of it with all the politics and working with the government and big airplanes and all of that. And so he ensconced himself in the penthouse of one of the hotels that he owned in Las Vegas, and he was in seclusion. Nobody could get to him. The problem was, is that he really wasn't in seclusion because he had all of these companies to run.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so it wasn't a matter of physical seclusion. It's a matter of mental seclusion. Which is what we started talking about in the very beginning of this conversation, is that you've got, in order to be creative, you've got to get away from your creation. You got to go walk in the woods like Beethoven.

**Speaker A:** I know there's not enough woods around here. Don't walk in the city, the dirty streets of South London. It's good enough.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's not the dirtiness in the streets, it's the dirtiness of not liking those dirty streets that you've got in your mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's the place that we need to start changing, and we can do that any place. Because believe me when I tell you that the The tropical rainforest of southern Thailand is not the ideal place to be. You got snakes and bugs and creepy-crawlers and hot weather and no electricity and heavy-duty sunshine. And the rainy season comes. And so you can't say that it's a paradise until you start recognizing that it's a paradise mentally. You can find 10,000 things wrong with the place, wherever the place is. But in fact, this is, by the way, the story of Adam and Eve.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Because the story of Adam and Eve is not the way that it's told in the religion. They get all uptight about a talking snake, and the woman did it first, and the apple, and God kicked him out of paradise. But if you read the story correctly— and in fact, I learned to read the story from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, who was quite fond of the story of Adam and Eve because it's all Dharma. Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. Okay, what is eating the fruit? Means they had to put up with the results of their judgmental attitude, and they judged their paradise into a hell. They didn't get kicked out of physical paradise. They got kicked out of a mental paradise. How did they get kicked out of it? By choosing what was good about it and what was bad about it, rather than just accepting the whole thing the way that it is to be in reality. So I can accept the jungle, living in the tropical forest in southern Thailand, And it becomes a paradise because I change my attitude about it.

**Speaker A:** Is it, you know, the sin of Adam and Eve? Like, is in this context, in the context of like with this telling of it, what is the sin measuring good against evil, or is it like questioning in itself? Is it like kind of wanting to get theoretical, like questioning, like, well, what is this? And like, why are we here?

**Speaker B:** Oh, we've already been through this in one of our other discussions, haven't we? Okay, maybe.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker B:** Questioning comes from doubt and unsure. And so we become unsure. And you were asking a whole lot of questions about how to get it right. In fact, that's what you said. Oh, well, I'm asking all these questions because I'm trying to get it right. And trying to get it right, like relaxing in just the right way. Well, guess what? The right way to relax is to stop trying to get it the right way and just relax. They're trying to get it right, and that's the struggle again. Yeah, that's the questioning. It's like, that's the doubt, and the doubt's a hindrance to being actually happy. Let's just be happy and stop asking all of those questions. Going back to that word stop, let's just stop. Stop asking questions. Stop trying to get it right. Stop trying to make it better and just be satisfied with the way that it is.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think what it is maybe is like I have creativity tied to doing things in a methodical way or like figuring things out and like evolution maybe. Yeah, I think maybe I'm tying evolving or something with making things right, and that also to creativity.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And guess what? You'll never get it right. The question is, can you enjoy tinkering with it? Because if you're enjoying tinkering with it, then right and wrong don't mean anything anymore. Now what is important is that you're having fun at what you do. And when you're having fun at what you do, you gain skills at doing it. And so you get better and better at doing what you enjoy doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And what is right and what is wrong anyway? Making that judgment of right and wrong is what throws us out of our own paradise. Yeah, yeah, trying to get it right is hell. Yeah, enjoying it the way that it actually is is just okay. And so when you're right, when you're writing music and enjoying writing the music, the music is good. When you've got to get it done, the quality deteriorates when you put pressure on yourself. So long as what you're doing is fun to do, you'll figure out all kinds of things to do that's fun to do. So start having fun in your life rather than trying to get it right. Yeah, I tried to get music right, didn't get it. Tried to get electronics right, didn't get it. Trying to get psychology right, didn't get it. In fact, that was one of the things that I began to see is that psychology doesn't work. Much of the reason is that the people are not practicing really carefully. They expect the psychologist to do the work for them. Yeah, I mean, they're paying $300 an hour. Why don't you do your job and fix me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Kittu, I have this thought that is not a conscious thought, you know, but it just came into my mind then, so I thought I would just like maybe bring it up. So sometimes I just feel like everything, you know, in the Dhamma or anything that is meant to be this kind of way of seeing life in a true way, like seeing things as they are. Sometimes I just feel like, um, well, I have this thought that tells me that I'm just kind of making the best out of a bad situation. That's the phrase.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So it's like kind of like things are— it's almost like I believe that everything is like pointless, but we're just going like, well, just— All right, well.

**Speaker B:** Let'S go with that. If things are pointless, if things are meaningless, a lot of people get really miserable because they think that they've got to have a point to it. Why am I working so hard? Well, there's a point to all of this. And the answer really is, is that no, nothing has any meaning at all. 300 years from now, you're going to be dead, buried long ago, and nobody remembers you about anything. Yeah, all your music will be forgotten. Very rarely that— in fact, it was only when music was new, from Bach you know, from the Baroque times to Bach. But very few people remember any of the other musicians. And so you've got, what, a handful, maybe only about 20.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Look at all the rock bands that were competing with the time with the Beatles, and only the Beatles are remembered. But they're going to be forgotten. I mean, who plays Beethoven? Everybody knows of Beethoven, but they don't play it much anymore. That in fact most of the Beethoven that you'll ever hear is not being played, it's being— you're listening to an old recording. And so that kind of stuff dies out. Nothing has any meaning, nothing's going to last, everything dies. So why don't we enjoy the moment?

**Speaker A:** So are we making the best out.

**Speaker B:** Of a kind of— you don't have to make the best of it. Why do you want to make the best of it? Let's have fun instead.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but that is kind of making the best out of it.

**Speaker B:** It's like, well, that's the making best of it in the sense of enjoying it rather than having a high score, right? A really good example of that is the Harlem Globetrotters. Have you ever heard of them?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, with.

**Speaker B:** Metal Lark, the star. Okay, they became an exhibition team. They were just an ordinary basketball team. But when they started having fun with it, by giving the other team the score, going and making a basket for them, giving the kid— in fact, they would go to high schools. They came to our high school one time, and it was a ball because all of the high school students were doing their best to try to beat the Harlem Globetrotters. And the Golden Globetrotters were already so good, they were just having fun with the kids. That gives the ball to the kid and take it away from him, then give it back to him.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I struggle with this. Okay, but where are you going with this? You're just going with— okay, so yeah, that's the example of like making— live.

**Speaker B:** Your life as an exhibition. Yeah, not a performance, not a score. They do this, by the way, with Zen archery, that they don't have competitions. They have expositions. In other words, they're not judged. They don't have a competition. They just show, they just demonstrate their skills. Yeah, they, they're having fun at it because there's no real meaning in having a high score. Winning a trophy doesn't mean anything.

**Speaker A:** What is disturbing is just feeling like I can probably deal with having no meaning isn't sad to me, but it's more the feeling of like, if there is no kind of, I don't know, meaning. It just is a sense of like, Yeah, well, no, it's more like not being like kind of, kind of cared for or something. I mean, this is like very probably.

**Speaker B:** Deep in my— right, because a lot of us think that we're going to be well loved and well cared for if we have people who love us and care for us because they like our performance. Fans, right? Like the musicians, they want to have a lot of fans. Yeah, look at the lifestyles and the lives of so many musicians who've made it to the top of their career, right? And they're still not satisfied. Now they go off into drugs. I mean, Elvis Presley is a really good example of a very failed musician, even though his music is still popular. That's because the people like it and they feel good when they're doing it. But he had a tragic life. How about John Belushi? I really love John Belushi and Animal House and all the things that he did. But he died because of a drug overdose, because he wasn't satisfied. The question is, can you be satisfied without being a star? The answer, of course, is yes, definitely can. Yeah, that's the whole point, is that we can lead lives of quiet joy rather than leading the life of quiet desperation, trying to climb the mountain to get to the top because we think we'll get fans and get success and be loved. The question is, can you love yourself? Can you love this moment? Can you have happiness and joy, nurture yourself. But we're taught in our society to be critical of ourselves, to do better and do better.

**Speaker A:** Does this happiness come from recognizing the kind of truth in the middle of all the delusions, or is it like just like a kind of— you're trained to do that? Because that's what is bothering me, is like, are we training ourselves to just behave in this way, or are we like being truthful? You know, I kind of feel like I used to read like— I used to read fucking existentialist shit. So like, this is in my brain from when I was like a teenager, and like I didn't believe in like free will, and I was just like.

**Speaker B:** You know, oh, you want to hear my story about free will? Guess what? There is will, but in order to gain our will, we have to have skill in order to do it. I believe so. The gaining of the skill then means that we have to put in the right effort in order to gain the skill. Right. So in that regard, will is not free. It's expensive. You got to put in the effort.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's good.

**Speaker B:** Okay. That's real freedom, that will and willpower and freedom is a skill development process. So here's the question then. Would you rather gain the skills of being a top quality music performer or composer whose work is in the East End plays or on Hollywood movies, and you're desperate and you got to write another piece and write another piece and you're miserable, but you're very good, very well known.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or the option would be is develop the skills that you don't care about any of that stuff, that you're having too much fun. Just playing with the music, just experimenting, just, you know, life becomes a dance or a joy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's the question.

**Speaker B:** See, well, it's not a hard choice.

**Speaker A:** I'm kidding. I think I'll do it.

**Speaker B:** But that's where we are trained in our society, is to be successful at something And then you can be happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And instead of training that the real skill is to be happy without having to do anything, therefore you don't have to work anymore. You can just be happy. You can just be successful at being easygoing.

**Speaker A:** I think there's— but like, is that Is that— I don't know why I'm relating everything to truth, like, is that because we should be happy, or is that because we want to be happy?

**Speaker B:** Well, what your choice— that's the whole thing, is that here's a way of saying it, is that In our society, the way that the children are raised, they don't have much choice. The example was when I was in music, my dad wanted me in music. I didn't have much choice about it. It was only later when I figured out that I have a choice. All right, so if you recognize that you do have a choice about almost everything How would you choose to feel? You've got a choice. When you don't have a choice, you feel the way that you've been feeling. It's a habit. But once you have a choice, how are you going to feel? Now, that's not a 'I'm going to feel this way all the time,' but every moment you have a choice about how you're going to feel right now. So right now, if you could feel the way you wanted to feel, how would you feel? Sad, miserable, frustrated, under pressure? Or would you rather feel easygoing, light, everything's okay? And a lot of it has to do with whether or not we believe that there is meaning in it. Oh, if I study, work hard, and get all of this done, then I'll get famous, and then I can be happy. When I get what I want, I'll be happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we often never get what we want. So what we can do is wisely choose what we want. And the way that we would wisely choose what we want is by choosing things that are easy to get.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. So we are training ourselves to.

**Speaker B:** Feel the way you want to feel. It's a good— yeah, we're training to feel our way, to feel the way that we want to feel, rather than feeling the way that we were trained to feel and then trying to feel better by getting the stuff that society has told us that we have to do in order to feel good.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** This is called the direct method. The indirect method is the way that society works. An example is, is I'll be happy if I get a girl. I can't get a girl because I don't have a car, so now I got to go get a car and chick magnet.

**Speaker A:** Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so I work really hard and I go get that chick magnet, and then I got to use that chick magnet and work really hard to get a girl. And even after I get the girl and the chick magnet, I'm still not happy. Yeah, because she's a lot of work, because she's not happy either.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, I think that the root of my troubles are more like existential. Like, it's like, why though? It's like, it's more about like, why do I exist kind of stuff. Like, do I exist?

**Speaker B:** Does it matter why you exist?

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know. It does.

**Speaker B:** No, it doesn't. The fact is, is that you do exist. Why don't you enjoy existing rather than pondering why you exist? This is exactly the same issue as the Christians and the atheists talking about the Big Bang. How did everything get started, right? We try to go back in the past to justify the present. We don't need the past to justify the present. We don't even have to justify the present. We can just enjoy the fact that here it is. We become satisfied with the way things are. Let's investigate reality. Rather than investigate causality. Yes, because we will never figure out the causality, but we can in fact enjoy the reality.

**Speaker A:** Oh man, that's crazy. I think this kind of stuff is like where there is maybe.

**Speaker B:** You know.

**Speaker A:** There are a lot of things I need to consider with this, this, this whole issue. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** No, that's the whole point. Stop considering all of that stuff. Well, there's so much I need to consider. No, you don't have to consider any of that stuff. You can say, wow, I am so glad I don't have to consider all that stuff. Oh, what a relief it is. I don't have to consider all of that. I can just sit down and enjoy.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm just not used to it.

**Speaker B:** I know, this is why it takes right effort. Right effort is built right into the Eightfold Noble Path. Well, okay, if I do this and look and see what's going on and then make a change.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, did the Buddha understand what, like, maybe he wouldn't tell me, but did he understand why he existed?

**Speaker B:** He would say that that's an irrelevant question. We don't need to know why we exist. The fact is that we do. How far back in the past? You can say, oh, it's because my mommy and daddy. And then you can say, well, where did they come from? Oh, that's because I had grandparents. Well, where did they come from? Oh, that's because I had great-grandparents. How far back do we have to go until we're lizards?

**Speaker A:** I guess so.

**Speaker B:** Well, the lizards were, you know, they were kind of new on the block. What about one-celled animals? And where did they come from? Just acids and just combinations. So we're back to the elements. So you're nothing but hydrogen and oxygen and carbon. That's all we are.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So do it. I mean, it's not complicated. Why do we keep trying to make it so complicated? It's simple.

**Speaker A:** Because it's like, what was before everything?

**Speaker B:** Before— I don't care, I wasn't there, not my problem. The question is not what happened way long ago. The question is what's happening right now. So much is happening right now, I don't have time to think about what used to be. It's gone, it's dead, it's over. But we have right now, and right now is great.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so if right now is great, then back then was probably great as well?

**Speaker B:** No, right now is great because I see it that way. Before, it wasn't great because I didn't understand it. I was too busy trying to figure out causality rather than seeing right now I've got a reality. Never mind how I got here.

**Speaker A:** Right now is only great because we think it's great.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. The mind is the forerunner for everything. Major teaching of the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** That's crazy.

**Speaker B:** So we're kind of like— No, it's not crazy. That's reality.

**Speaker A:** I just feel like I'm like an AI. That's how I feel. I feel like I'm like just ChatGPT come to life. You know, I'm just like programmed this way.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Okay. Which is another way of looking at it would be that all the things that we think, that we think are my thoughts, I'm thinking this thought, this is my thought. In fact, it's not true. The thoughts that we think often come from someplace else, from before. We're just repeating the past over and over and over again. So why should I bother to do that? Let me just relax instead. Don't have to think about anything. It's just old stuff, doesn't have much meaning.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** What has meaning right now, if anything has meaning, is the meaning that you make right now.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** And so if you make up causality, then that's where you're stuck. But if you can give up making up what happened and how did we get here into, hey, it's nice to have arrived. Once I'm at the train station, does it matter what train I was on when I got here?

**Speaker A:** It's almost like I just, I feel like I need, it's like the purpose of, I think that I believe that the purpose of existing is to kind of figure out something. Like why I exist.

**Speaker B:** Would you be happy when you figure that out?

**Speaker A:** No, it's just that would you be.

**Speaker B:** Satisfied if you figure it out, or would you just be in the state of wanting to figure stuff out? And so once you get one thing figured out, now you got to go figure out something else and you're still not happy. We get in the habit of trying to figure stuff out. And so another way of saying it, we're problem-solving machines. And so one of the biggest problems that a problem-solving machine can have is to have no problems to solve. And so we create problems just to have problems to solve. Until we give up trying to solve problems and say, "Hey, I was solving problems in order to be happy. I can just be happy without solving any problems. Don't have to solve them. Just enjoy." This is why the Buddhist teaching is called profound, subtle, difficult, only for the wise. Yeah, because the ordinary person is still trying to figure stuff out because he thinks that it's got some meaning. This is why the religious cling to their religion, because they think that the religion has meaning. That they think, oh, that we have a God and that God gives meaning to everything. And God don't care. God, if he's as great and as magnificent and all-powerful and omniscient and omnipotent, then he's got so much going on that nothing in particular means anything to him. Then it all becomes kind of meaningless.

**Speaker A:** We exist. What do you think about this idea?

**Speaker B:** Isn't that wonderful? I exist, yes, and I'm going to die. Let me enjoy my existence while I've got it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But do you, not Dhammarato, but will you exist Like, will you exist like after that in any way?

**Speaker B:** Does it matter?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I feel like you're not telling me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, it doesn't matter. That's the whole point. It's irrelevant what, um, you're talking about cause and effect. If there is only the effect and you don't know what the cause is Maybe there was no cause. Yeah, or maybe the cause is completely different than anything that you thought was the cause. But all we have is the reality of what's happening right now. People get stuck up into rebirth and reincarnation mostly because of the fear of dying. The fear of death is the self-preservation mechanism. The self-preservation instinct is built right into our DNA. And the right way to look at it is, let's become fearless. Let's be safe and secure right now and handle the reality of the world right now. If there is a future, I'll handle it just fine. Because I know how to handle right now. I don't have to worry about handling the future, whatever the future will be.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and it's just because we can. It's just because, like, well, we can't—.

**Speaker B:** Because of the confidence. I've got the confidence that I can handle anything no matter what it is, and I don't have to go dream it up so that I get a solution for it.

**Speaker A:** It's quite like absurd. It's quite absurd in a way. Which is why I'm struggling. There's like an absurdity to just— well.

**Speaker B:** And most people are caught in that absurdity. The whole world is caught up in that absurdity. This is why the Buddha talks about the ignorance of it all.

**Speaker A:** No, but I mean, I mean, I mean, um, what's absurd is like being, you know, in the situation and then being like kind of only here and only basing off the idea that you can do things, and so you just do things that you like because you can. I think that's like— feels like an absurd premise. And I don't mean absurd in a derogatory way, I mean like absurd in like baffling sense.

**Speaker B:** It goes against what you've been taught.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it feels absurd to me.

**Speaker B:** Right. And so can you change that feeling of absurd, which actually has the quality of doubt and questioning? Can you just relax with it? Yes, absurd, so what? It's okay that it's absurd. I'll be happy. Absurd or not? Yeah, because if it's so absurd, I'm not going to get an answer right now. And if I get the answer, I'll find something else that's absurd, and then I'll, uh, worry and fret over that. When are we going to bring all of this questioning the absurd to an end and just enjoy it? My dad had an expression that I never really appreciated until years later after he was dead, and that was, as he said, that work, I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside and take a nap. I'm not afraid of work. So here you are with the absurd. Don't be afraid of the absurd. You can lay down and take a nap beside the absurd. The mystery of it all. Yeah, so what is mysterious? That's okay. I'm not afraid of it.

**Speaker A:** It's mysterious to me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so what?

**Speaker A:** It's not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let it be. In fact, enjoy the mystery. Enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** Is the mystery a product of our limitations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's our ignorance. That's what mysterious is all about, is that we're ignorant.

**Speaker A:** Yes, because I feel like I'm coming up against walls of like, you know.

**Speaker B:** And you enjoy coming up against the wall, that it's absurd. Yeah, there's that wall of absurdness there. There's this wall of meaning there.

**Speaker A:** There are things outside the wall No.

**Speaker B:** You don't know that. No, you're hoping, but you don't know.

**Speaker A:** Does the Buddha know that?

**Speaker B:** And the whole point— well, these levels— it doesn't matter. But they all enjoy— where— well, we— it doesn't matter. I don't know. But I do know that the state that I have gotten is much, much more enjoyable than the states that I had when I was asking the kind of questions that you're asking. Yeah, maybe getting beyond the wall is to learn to enjoy the wall.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, classic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or another one is to recognize that you're the one who built the wall. There's no wall there. You're the one who's creating the wall, hoping something beyond it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Trying to keep out the immigrants. Trying to keep out the Mexicans.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they make good Mexican food.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, let them in.

**Speaker B:** Let them in, enjoy.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah. Okay, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, you make that wall. Can you understand that you're the one who's made the wall there? The mysterious wall, the wall of causality, the wall of mystery, the wall of meaning, and you can't get past it. And the reality is that there's no wall there. Yeah, that's just delusional. It's like we don't need to know if it's not here. This is one of the points I started to make a while ago. If you've got no evidence, none at all, zip, nada, then its existence is irrelevant because it's got no effect upon you at all. So whether rebirth and reincarnation or magical powers or any of that kind of stuff exist or not, it's irrelevant because it's not affecting me right now. I don't know and I don't care. Because it can't affect me. That what in fact can affect me is my own mind. And when I get that under control, then when I come across things that I've never seen before, I can handle them just fine. Rebirth, nothing to it, I can handle it. Reincarnation, nothing to it, I can handle that too. Magical power, sure, bring them on, I'll check them out. I can handle that. Um, I can enjoy it right now. I don't have to deal with it. So why, why are you dealing with it in your mind when in fact there's nothing to deal with? You're trying to figure out something without proper evidence. Wait until you get the evidence and then do an evaluation. Until then, deal with the evidence you've got. And the evidence you've got is we're alive, we're real, here it is, let's enjoy it, it's temporary, let's have fun at it. You can enjoy your life right now for the rest of your life, as opposed to worrying about what life is like for the rest of your life without even experiencing life itself, because you're too worried about what it's about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and karma and stuff, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, karma is basically that you don't like what happened, and you don't like the results, and you don't even know the results. That in fact, to be honest with you, a lot of what we've been talking about today, the Buddha did reference under the condition of the Four Imponderables.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Have you ever heard of the Four Imponderables?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** What is the causality? How did it all get started? We'll never know. That's an imponderable. We don't know. We don't have the evidence. How about the results of good and bad actions? The Kamma. We don't know what's going to happen with the Kamma. We don't know what our actions will have in the future, but we do know how they affect us right now.

**Speaker A:** And is this imponderable, full stop?

**Speaker B:** Yes, imponderable. Don't ponder it, but the Buddha, because you You wouldn't come to an answer, so don't try to come to an answer. That's a lot of work that's going to be fruitless. It's got no value to it other than keeping you feeling bad with your doubts, your worries, your curiosities.

**Speaker A:** Just to quench me, if we go to another level of consciousness, Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** But you don't even know what that is. That's an idea, a dream that you have. You're making that up. Well, doesn't the Buddhist teaching actually on one of the other of the Four Imponderables? One of the Four Imponderables is what is the extent of the human mind. You don't know that. Beethoven had no idea that his piano music and his orchestral music will not be played anymore, but it'll still be heard because it's all on recording. He didn't ponder that. He had no concept of it. Yeah, 20 years ago, people did not have any concept of a cell phone until they were invented in 2005. Okay, but you don't know the extent of what's going to happen.

**Speaker A:** These imponderables are related to being a human, this mind. Yeah, maybe, maybe they're not related to if you're like a celestial being.

**Speaker B:** Well, guess what? What is a celestial being? What do they talk like? How do they happen? I want to go, I want to go into this just a little bit, and I'll start with this, the burning bush in Genesis. Yeah, okay. And that Moses was wearing sandals, and the burning bush says, Moses, take off thou shoes, for thy are upon holy ground. You see, Moses was on holy ground. He didn't even know it. You're in paradise yourself right now, and you don't even know it. That in a really, really big and important way, I am a celestial being. And you've met him and you still don't know that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's interesting. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** But because your ideas of celestial beings doesn't fit the reality of what you find right in front of you. And so we live in an idealized ideal world And then we make ourselves miserable because reality doesn't match up to our ideals.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Like, okay, Adam and Eve lost their paradise because the paradise they had didn't match up to their delusions about what was good and bad, right? And wrong. And so they lost the paradise they had. And here you have lost your paradise, that you're right in it. In fact, I go barefoot almost all the time. I would say that I wear shoes less than about 2 hours a month. And I have gone that way for years. When I was a monk in the United States and the Christians would come by and they'd say, "Well, why do you go barefoot all the time?" And I says, don't you know the story of the burning bush? I'm likely to be on holy ground any moment now. I'm going to be ready for it.

**Speaker A:** That's good.

**Speaker B:** And when the mind is whole, when it's unified, when you're not dividing it between right and wrong and good and bad and up and down and confusions and thoughts and lies that we tell, when the mind is unified and whole, That makes it holy. So just relax. You're in a holy place already. You've already arrived. There's no place to go. Stop being a pilgrim and start being a saint right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Stop being on your way to someplace and recognize that you've arrived. You're already enlightened, so the Zen master says.

**Speaker A:** And is it inherently holy? Is it? Is this?

**Speaker B:** It's already holy. And reality is real. That's what makes it holy.

**Speaker A:** Despite what we think.

**Speaker B:** Right. It's our hell of the mind that we make.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Because we judge it.

**Speaker A:** So there's reality in our mind and then there's reality.

**Speaker B:** The reality that we make up, the stories we tell, Okay, I like that.

**Speaker A:** That's good.

**Speaker B:** And let's stop doing that and start living in reality, real reality. Here it is. Wow, we live in a paradise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I think makes me feel much better is because I don't want to just be like, I kind of, you know, Blade Runner, you know, like nobody's like, I feel like Blade Runner guy a lot. You know Blade Runner? And he's like, you know, I know the concept.

**Speaker B:** I know, I know that it's a movie. I know there's a '47 and a 2000 and something. You know, there's several movies about Blade Runner, but you can hear the word blade and you can hear the word runner and put those together and you've got a problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so like the book as well is about, you know, it's like he's a kind of machine who doesn't realize he's a machine. And I'm really quite— I've been scared of that.

**Speaker B:** So, but I— Okay, so you're a machine if that's the reality of the situation. We're a biological electromechanical machine. Well, that's what I've got, a really bad program. And what that program is, is that you're worried about who you are, when in fact who you are is not important.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. But I'm relieved because like I do understand that there is, it's not all just like a kind of, I'm not a freaking, I don't know, robot, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's okay if you're a robot. Are you a happy robot? Are you full of misery robot? Doesn't matter what you call yourself. The question is, how do you feel? Yeah, and one thing about robots, they haven't learned it. They haven't been able to teach the robots how they actually feel. They've only taught them how to repeat what humans have told them. Just like you, in a way, you're much more of a robot because you're just asking the questions that you read out of a book or heard someplace else. Yeah, can you actually be human by beginning to feel the way you want to feel? Relaxed, comfortable, happy, whole, holy.

**Speaker A:** So that's like free will.

**Speaker B:** Except that it's not, because you started off being not free, not having goodwill. And you have to manufacture that. You have to train, you have to practice to come out of your bad habits of questioning everything and just enjoy. That's the effort. The right noble effort is to put away all the questions, all the thoughts, all the worries, all the problems. All the causality, all the original causes, all of what's going to happen with Kamma.

**Speaker A:** That's free will.

**Speaker B:** All of those. Yeah, just put it all aside and just say, wow, I don't have to think about any of that stuff right now. What a relief it is to not have anything to worry about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so doing all of that, you're saying, is like the programming, and then coming out of it is coming out of it.

**Speaker B:** It's just relaxing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, which is like on the computer.

**Speaker B:** Just go into idle mode. You don't have any programs running, so just take it easy. The CPU is cool, it's not working so hard.

**Speaker A:** But we decide to do that? Do we decide to do that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, every moment you have a choice.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good. I'm kind of scared because like in the past with some non-dual teachers who I was learning from, they have a thing about, you know, non-doership, which I get, I totally get that, but it was like too much. And at the time I was like too young and I didn't really get it, so I was just kind of taking it as like anything I do.

**Speaker B:** Is Figuring it out is duality. There's you and the problem. When you don't have any problem, then there's just reality. Yeah, the unity. Yes, that's— I'm very much into the non-dual. In fact, I don't even like the word non-dual and just use the word holy, wholeness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I think with a lot of those teachers, they're just kind of doing their own thing, which is based.

**Speaker B:** Off like They read that stuff, now they're repeating it without fully understanding it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like Maharshi and, you know, I Am That, that stuff. And they go, you know, like, well, there is no one, which I get that, but it's like, you can't really just say that on a YouTube video, you know what I mean? It's like, how is that helpful? I'm just saying like to these people, you know, why? Why?

**Speaker B:** Okay, here's the really funny answer. Why do we think we need help? You've already got all you need. I'm not trying to be helpful. I'm just trying to explain to you that you don't need help. What you need is to stop trying to get help.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And just enjoy. Stop trying to get love. There's a song you know, I know you know this song, Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. Looking for love, that's what you're doing. You're looking for love and you've got it mislabeled. And when you start to love yourself, then you've got all the love you need. But we're looking for love in all the wrong places. We're trying to figure it out. Yeah, just love yourself. Just love yourself. Everything is cool. Just relax. Oh, take it easy. That's when you become unified, is when you just love yourself. It's okay. Everything's all right. Yeah, love yourself, warts and all. Okay, you're already okay.

**Speaker A:** These things that I have will either disappear or be— well, if they disappear.

**Speaker B:** That they don't mean anything. They don't mean anything after they've disappeared. How could they possibly mean anything before they've disappeared? It doesn't mean anything. Just enjoy your life.

**Speaker A:** Oh shit. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Wow, what a relief.

**Speaker A:** It's just the arising stuff, which is something that I've been attached to, maybe. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Attached to how things are supposed to be rather than enjoying the way things are. They're supposed to mean something, you know, so we got to go find that meaning. Guess what? We don't have to find meaning. We can just relax.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just all these movies and stuff, like, like literally, like the movies No, like the Holy Grail stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're looking for something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 3 acts. You need 3 acts, you know, and then you need the film to end.

**Speaker B:** But the actual movie of the Holy Grail, in a way, you know, the Monty Python movie, in a real way, is sending up that Holy Grail issue. Yeah, there is no Holy Grail. Yeah, or if there is, here it is. This is it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and then, you know, at the end, he's being crucified, then he's whistling.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's life of Brian.

**Speaker A:** Oh shit. Yeah, whatever.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the whole thing.

**Speaker A:** Whatever. I mean, I think that that's always.

**Speaker B:** Look on the bright side of life. That I'm Those are movies out of my time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So make your life a comedy. Start enjoying life. Yeah, you're not going to get out of it alive anyway. There's no meaning to your life anyway, so just enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** There's no meaning. Meaning is like a made-up concept.

**Speaker B:** A made-up concept. And guess what? It's made-up concept by those who think that there is meaning, and now they want you to have meaning so that they can exploit you. That almost all meaning is exploitation. An example of that is, God means something, give me money.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh. Oh yeah, shit.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you've got to have a job so that the boss can make money off of it, and so money is the meaning.

**Speaker A:** Jesus. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And money doesn't really mean anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is a very oppressive thing then, maybe, you know, maybe created through these for means of corruption, meaning. Okay, I like that. That's a very good way of looking at it because I feel I can distance myself from meaning now a bit more.

**Speaker B:** Great, good. Because it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing. So let's get that swing. And make your own meaning.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, stop swinging, take the base for a walk.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, this has been a really good talk. I've really enjoyed it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, same. I think it started out with something that I wasn't really— I think I'm more interested in this other stuff than the stuff we were talking about in the latter half, you know. It's more like what is really on my mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what's really— yeah, what's really going on is that we need to relax and just enjoy life. Yeah, everything is okay already. The reality is that we are in a paradise. Stop judging it because we destroy it when we judge it, trying to figure it out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's easy.

**Speaker B:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** See you. I'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, see you soon.

**Speaker A:** So much. Thanks. Bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between a student (Speaker A) and the teacher Dhammarato (Speaker B), explores the intersection of creativity, meditation, and finding peace in the present moment. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Themes and Advice:**

1.  **Creativity as Letting Go, Not Striving:** The central metaphor is that creativity, like meditation, arises from ease and relaxation, not pressure and striving. Examples are given:
    *   **Steve Allen** creating a song from city skyline notes.
    *   **Beethoven** developing symphonies from simple, repeated themes during walks.
    *   **Thomas Edison's** "1% inspiration, 99% perspiration" is reframed; the inspiration comes from playful experimentation, not hard struggle.
    *   **Conclusion:** "Creativity is in fact a kind of letting go... Writer's block comes from working too hard to try to come up with the next thing."

2.  **The Pressure of "Getting it Right" Creates Suffering:** The student's struggle with music composition and existential doubt is linked to a habitual pattern of pressure.
    *   This pattern repeats in meditation: having a good session, then trying to force a repeat, which ruins the next session.
    *   The advice is to **stop trying to "get it right"**—whether in music, meditation, or life—and instead **"have fun," "play with it," and "enjoy the tinkering."** Quality emerges from enjoyment, not pressure.

3.  **Finding Meaning vs. Enjoying Reality:** The student's deeper existential angst ("making the best out of a bad situation," "why do I exist?") is addressed.
    *   Dhammarato advises shifting focus from **causality and meaning** (the unanswerable "why") to **reality and present experience** (the tangible "what is").
    *   He references the **Buddha's "Four Imponderables"** (like the exact workings of karma or the origin of the universe), stating that pondering them is fruitless and leads to doubt. The path is to put these questions aside.
    *   **Key Insight:** "We become satisfied with the way things are. Let's investigate reality. Rather than investigate causality."

4.  **Paradise is a Mental State, Not a Place:** Using the story of **Adam and Eve**, Dhammarato explains that we "eat the fruit of knowledge of good and evil" by judging our experience. This judgmental attitude turns our mental paradise into a hell.
    *   We create "walls" of mystery, meaning, and causality that trap us. The solution is to realize **we built the walls** and can stop.
    *   **"The mind is the forerunner of all things."** Happiness comes from choosing to see the present as "holy" and complete, not from achieving future goals. **"Stop being a pilgrim and start being a saint right now."**

5.  **Practical Guidance for the Student:**
    *   **On Creativity:** Don't force composition. Get happy and relaxed first, then creativity will flow. Use simple techniques like varying tempo, playing backwards, or repeating a simple theme (the "Beethoven game").
    *   **On Life Path:** Don't ordain or make major life changes as an escape from dissatisfaction. First, learn to be "happy and joyful on your own in seclusion," then see your situation with clear wisdom.
    *   **On Existential Angst:** Recognize the habit of problem-solving and questioning. Actively choose to put those questions down and **"just enjoy."** The feeling of absurdity is okay; you can "take a nap beside the absurd."

### **Conclusion:**

The talk is a journey from a specific creative block to the universal human struggle with seeking meaning and control. Dhammarato's consistent message is that **freedom, creativity, and peace are found in relinquishing the struggle,** relaxing into the present moment, and choosing to enjoy reality as it is, without the oppressive need to judge it, figure it out, or give it grand meaning. The path is one of **ease, self-love, and playful engagement** with life, not one of striving for distant goals or answers.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich and wide-ranging conversation, here are the key metaphors and stories used, primarily by **Speaker B (Dhammarato)**, to illustrate his points about creativity, the Dharma, and finding contentment.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Box" of Creativity:** Creativity is described as something we mistakenly try to "put in a box" or force, when it actually requires freedom and lack of pressure.
2.  **Writer's Block as a Universal Hindrance:** Writer's block is used as a metaphor for any creative or spiritual blockage caused by striving and pressure, not just in writing but in meditation and life.
3.  **The "Wall":** The speaker describes the existential questions (why do I exist? what is meaning?) as a "wall" that we build ourselves. The solution isn't to break through it, but to realize we built it and to "enjoy the wall" or see that it isn't really there.
4.  **The "Direct" vs. "Indirect" Method:**
    *   **Indirect Method:** The societal norm: "I'll be happy **if** I get X (a car, a girl, fame)." This is a roundabout, unsatisfying path.
    *   **Direct Method:** Choosing to be happy and relaxed **first**, as a foundation, from which action then flows naturally.
5.  **Programming / AI / Robot:** The speaker agrees with Speaker A's feeling of being like programmed AI or a robot. He reframes it: we *are* programmed by society with habits of questioning and striving. "Free will" or freedom is the skillful effort required to "reprogram" ourselves into a state of relaxed enjoyment.
6.  **Idle Mode:** Related to the computer metaphor, the ideal state is likened to a CPU in "idle mode"—cool, not overworking, simply present.
7.  **The "Swing":** Referencing the jazz standard, he says "it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing," using "swing" as a metaphor for the natural, joyful, relaxed rhythm one can bring to life.
8.  **The Three Baskets (Tripitaka) as a Bookshelf:** Used at the beginning to visually represent the vast, creative output of early Buddhist monks.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Steve Allen's Musical Skyline:** The story of the TV host creating a new song by assigning musical notes to the heights of buildings in a city skyline photo. This illustrates creativity as playful recombination from a new perspective.
2.  **Beethoven's Walks and Simple Themes:** The story of Beethoven humming on walks to generate simple motifs (like the famous four-note theme of the Fifth Symphony), which he then expanded through repetition and variation. This stresses that creativity starts from simple, relaxed play, not complex striving.
3.  **Thomas Edison and the Light Bulb:** The story of Edison's "99% perspiration" is flipped. His struggle (perspiration) was due to working too hard; the breakthrough (inspiration) came from playful experimentation with filaments and gases. This underscores the inefficiency of forced effort.
4.  **Albert Einstein's Dream Solutions:** The anecdote about Einstein solving problems in his sleep or upon waking is used to show how solutions arise when the conscious, striving mind is at rest.
5.  **The Navy Musician's Pivot:** Speaker B's personal story of feeling inadequate as a string bass player in the Navy band and pivoting to his true love—electronics and sound recording. This illustrates discovering one's authentic path versus following an imposed one.
6.  **Howard Hughes in Seclusion:** The story of the billionaire isolating himself physically but not mentally, still consumed by business. This distinguishes between **physical seclusion** and the essential **mental seclusion** of letting go.
7.  **The Harlem Globetrotters:** Referenced as an example of shifting from a competitive mindset (playing for a score) to an exhibition mindset (playing for joy and fun). Life should be an exhibition, not a performance judged by others.
8.  **Adam and Eve (Dhammic Interpretation):** A central, reinterpreted story. They were not kicked out of a physical Garden of Eden for disobedience. They "ate the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil"—meaning they began to **judge** their experience as good or bad. This act of judgment itself turned their mental paradise into a hell. We do the same.
9.  **Moses and the Burning Bush:** Referenced to make the point that any ground is "holy ground" when the mind is whole and unified. The speaker connects going barefoot to being ready to recognize the holiness present in any moment.
10. **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Influence:** The story of being directed to this Thai teacher and finally feeling "at home" in the Dharma after a long search through music, electronics, and psychology. This personal arc embodies the theme of seeking and finding contentment not in external achievements but in inner peace.
11. **The "Knuckle Song" (Chopsticks):** Referenced as an example of simple, joyful music that anyone can play, contrasting it with the pressure of formal piano lessons. The essence of a musical career should be that foundational joy.
12. **Monty Python's *Life of Brian*:** Alluded to at the end ("Look on the Bright Side of Life") to reinforce the idea that life should be approached as a comedy to be enjoyed, not a serious problem to be solved.

### **Core Narrative Arc**
The entire dialogue itself follows a metaphorical arc: it begins with the specific, "small" problem of **creative block**, uses stories about composers and inventors, and then follows Speaker B's personal story into the deeper, "big" problem of **existential angst and the search for meaning**. The metaphors and stories ultimately converge on the same solution: **stop striving, judging, and seeking external meaning; choose to relax, enjoy, and find paradise in the present reality of the mind.**
