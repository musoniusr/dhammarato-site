### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Sometimes what?

**Speaker B:** Sometimes it just— I just kind of forget, and then it goes into like a more subtle type of breath.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is that we keep forgetting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we keep forgetting. And so that's just the reason that of Sati— the Sati actually, even though, um, for some reason, uh, Goenka takes the word Sati out of Anapanasati and just calls it Anapana. Is actually Anapanasati, which is to remember to watch, remember to control the breathing. Remember that in the body scanning also, they kind of miss the point. And the point is, is the body scanning is for relaxing the body, making it comfortable, finding the tensions in the body and releasing them. It's not just a body scan. For body scan sake. They've actually lost part of the intention of the body scan. So I'm curious— The intention is to relax the body. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I guess like, why did Goenka feel that that system worked better?

**Speaker A:** Well, to be honest with you, and a lot of people in the old days recognize it, that while he was training in Burma, the Burmese government threw him out of Burma. Oh, he was deported from Burma, so he didn't actually get his training finished. But luckily enough for humanity, he started to teach what he did know, and that was a good thing. But I spent— did I tell you I spent quite a lot of time with him? Okay. Years in even. And that I left because something inside me kept saying there's something missing here. And it was only when I got to Thailand and was with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa that I began to understand and put and plug in the holes of what Goenka was missing. And then in fact, he's missing a lot. And he's actually— the important thing to say is that he was missing some key ingredients, just like so many of the meditation systems miss. The key ingredient dismissed is Right Noble Effort. You know that the Eightfold Noble Path does have an item called right noble effort.

**Speaker B:** I've heard of it, but I'm not.

**Speaker A:** Fully— I know that's the whole point, is, is that you, you haven't been drilled on it. And the right noble effort can be, uh, correctly defined as the least amount of effort to actually get the job done. That's what makes it noble. Is the least interference possible to actually move that mountain.

**Speaker B:** That sounds kind of like the lazy man's way of doing it, but I like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, the whole teaching of the Buddha is to stop being overly active, doing what you're told to do, chasing around trying to get stuff, and overworking in order to overachieve and therefore overcompensate Anagami, getting overcompensated. That those are the two extremes, is working too hard and then expecting results. And the expectation of the results is gimme, gimme, gimme. I— those results are due to me. Look at how hard I tried. Look how much effort I put in. And so I am due all of this stuff, and when I don't get it, then we start complaining. And we work even harder and complain more. And that's the cycle that we get in— two extremes of working too hard and expecting too much. And the middle path is don't work so hard, don't expect anything. Everything is already okay. The job that needed to be done was stop working so hard, and the benefit of the job well done is nothing. You get a whole lot of happy nothing. And this is part of the problem with Western mentality, is that they try to work too hard at meditation and then expect results.

**Speaker B:** I think that's my problem too.

**Speaker A:** And then explain when they don't get what they're looking for. We got activities here in the yard, but I don't have to do it now. So this is the going back to the point that we were talking about, is that we work too hard and expect too much. And when we stop working, we don't have to expect anything. And this is what begins to be the middle path. And so right noble effort is an effort, and in fact, for the beginner there's more effort. And one of the examples that I use is imagine that you're pushing a child in a swing. Okay, to start the swing off takes work. That first push is the hardest push, and after the swing gets going, all we have to do is keep pushing just a little bit. Pushing a little bit, pushing a little bit. It's easy. But if we stop pushing, the swing comes back due to gravity, due to inertia, and it stops again. And now we got to put in more right effort to get it moving again. And this happens to everybody. Everyone who practices meditation, they'll quit. And then something will happen and they'll start practicing again, and then they'll quit. And then something will happen and they start practicing again. And that, uh, what we, um, should be, um, let us say, remembering to do is a consistent practice, to keep practicing, to keep practicing. Yeah, if you forget a day, that's okay. Remember now to go back to it. Rather than letting it lapse. So this is the way that we do the right noble effort, is keep putting it in over and over and over again. We keep putting in effort, just a little bit of effort. And that's the part, like I said, dismissing. That's the real key. Is to keep putting in the effort, to keep coming back to wholesome thoughts, to keep coming back to taking long, deep, easy breath, and to keep relaxing the body. And when we're doing those things, wholesome thoughts and treating the body well, getting the body comfortable and relaxed, the two of them then work together on the feelings. So that we begin to feel okay, we begin to feel safe and secure and comfortable. And then we start to feel satisfied. Wow, this is good enough. And the anxiety drains away and the frustrations drain away and we can handle things really easily. Why? Because we're putting in the right effort.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] On that point, I just remembered, like sometimes during the sats, I like feel a sense of anxiety within my stomach, which was interesting because I didn't really feel it before. I'm not sure if I was breathing too hard or breathing incorrectly.

**Speaker A:** No, absolutely not. You're not creating. Let's put it this way. Let me ask you this question. Let's start this way. Okay. Do you think that anxiety is brand new and you're creating it? Do you actually think actually, upon reflection, that it's actually old anxiety that you may have not been looking at.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, as you're beginning to relax, you're beginning to notice that anxiety that's there, or that it comes and goes, but that the habit is old. Anxiety is something that children learn. And you're saying, the way that you stated it in the beginning, is that the anxiety is new. And that's not the case at all. You've known anxiety on and off for many years now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Which means that there may be a kind of a low-grade anxiety, and when you begin to relax that old anxiety begins to show itself. Well, there's something to do about it, and what is that? To start breathing in long, breathing out long. Notice that anxiety. In fact, we're back to body scanning now. Start looking at that anxiety, where it is in the body. Can you move it? When you breathe in, does it change? When you breathe out, does it change? And after just a few breaths, because you're paying attention to it, that anxiety will in fact start to change, start to modify, and eventually fall away. I'm glad that you mentioned that. That anxiety does not come up because of the meditation. That anxiety is revealed. By the meditation.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I guess it also sometimes stays with me throughout the day, so do I just keep observing it and taking long breaths?

**Speaker A:** Um, yes, that's the whole point, to keep coming back and taking the long breaths. Let that breath in fact help you to modify the tensions and anxieties in the body so that the body now can come to a state of rest and at ease. But we also have to have wholesome thoughts because the anxiety and the tensions come from having unwholesome thoughts. Mostly, "Oh, I've got to work really hard," and "Oh, I need a reward for all that work I'm doing." Can you in fact start to change that? Just relax. Everything is already okay. Everything is just fine. Okay, that's the way to practice. And it takes some going over and over again. And talking to me about it so that you can begin to get clear. Because the instructions are simple, but we can find a thousand different questions about them. Yes, a simple process. Okay, Anapanasati is not difficult. It sure does seem so. For one thing, it has good benefit right from the beginning. That's one of the qualities, is that you don't see that in the goenka retreats. You've probably heard this statement before, it's in the Dhammapada, but it's also in the Majjhima Nikaya, and it's also in the Sutta Nipata, some of the oldest literature where it's stated that the teachings of the Buddha are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with right phrasing, timing. Have you ever heard that before? Good in the beginning. Yeah. Is Goenka retreats good in the beginning?

**Speaker B:** Not so much.

**Speaker A:** Not so much. Well, how about the Anapanasati that we've been talking about? Is that good in the beginning?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it feels good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's part of the proof right there, is that, yeah, you're getting benefit immediately out of it. But you have to keep practicing. You have to keep going so that there winds up being a middle.

**Speaker B:** I guess when you say that statement, like, good in the beginning, good in the end, and good in the middle, good in the end, does that mean there's like no suffering in between?

**Speaker A:** Or— well, it means no suffering when you are, let us say, mindful enough and skillful enough to remove the suffering right then and there. Okay, to remove those unwholesome thoughts right then and there. Another point about Western mentality is that it's actually seen to be a long-term thing. In fact, they even talk about it taking lives and lives and many eons. That's really the wrong way to practice. The right way to practice is coming out of your Dukkha right now. Get in the habit of keep coming out of it, and pretty soon it gets easy to come out of it. Then after that, it's almost energetic coming out of it. As soon as you see it, out it goes. But in the beginning, it takes some effort. Okay. And so you get immediate relief. You see, that long-term Dukkha kind of attitude is that it's Dukkha in the beginning, Dukkha in the middle, and maybe no Dukkha in the end. And the correct way to practice is, as soon as you see the Dukkha right here, right now, let's get out of it. You see the tension in the body, when you see the anxiety in the body, let's play with it and get it out right now. When we have worries and doubts and frustrations, let's see that and come out of it right now. And when you think it's due and you start complaining, see that complaining and come out of it right now. Winds up being easy, but we have to practice it. You have to get it going, get it rolling.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that makes sense. I've been like trying to do it even outside of my satsang, or I have not tried to do it. Like whenever I remember, I'm like, oh, I'm suffering. I'm thinking about unwholesome thoughts. Let me not do that and think of wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** By the word trying is a victim's word. I am doing— trying has the quality of failing in the end, but remembering to do it has the quality of a winner.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And also you talked about like right noble effort and And I guess one component you said was just always coming back to it and remembering. Like, are there any other aspects of it?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, to do it again and to do it again. That in fact, getting it is getting it, and asking what's next is not really getting it.

**Speaker B:** So the only thing to it is just to keep doing it.

**Speaker A:** Keep doing it, exactly. Keep practicing, keep developing those skills over and over again. What is the skill that we're developing? Success. And as that builds up, the next thing that comes in— and we'll talk about this next time— The Pali word is Samma Sanghappa, and it has a twin word to it, it's called Shraddha or Saddha, and that means confidence. You keep practicing until you get the confidence that you can do this, and you develop the attitude that I can do this, I can come out of my suffering, I can do this job. And that's when the attitude from victimization turns into the attitude of a winner. You're the boss here. You're the emperor of your own pile of dirt. Yeah, you're going to be buried under it like a victim. You're going to be crawling your way out of it like a victim. That's how most people see meditation, is crawling out of it and eventually you get out. Or can you just simply come out of it and be on top of your own pile of dirt right away?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's what we're practicing, is being on top of the world. And clawing our way to the top is not practicing being on top of the world, it's practicing clawing. Very subtle difference. Of getting the attitude, "Hey, I've got this." And that's the Samma Sanghappa. This is also part of the Eightfold Noble Path. It's often referred to as right intention, but when it's translated as right thought, that misses the point. Right intention is a better way of saying it is right attitude, the attitude of "I've got this," the attitude of "We can do this." And then that develops into the attitude of no matter how much the mind gets obstructed, no matter what hindrances are there, we can come right out of it and see the reality as it is. Now that's an actual important point that Buddha makes, it's in Sutta number 48, is that no matter how obstructed the mind, the student has the competence and the skill to come right out of it, to know that he can come right out of it and come back into the reality and see the facts, see the truth, the way things really are. And then the Buddha says that that attitude is the first knowledge, it's the first real step on the path. It is a noble attitude, it is right And it's an attitude that's not held by very many people. It's a very unusual attitude. The masses don't have that attitude. They would rather complain. So that's the Samma Sanghappa. It's the changing of your attitude from being an attitude of "this has got me" into the attitude of "I've got it" by practicing this simple practice over and over and over and over and over again. Repetition. I will make one point. Some places in the sutra, the word "strive" is used, and I think that that's a bad translation by the people who are into striving. A much better word would be persistent. To persist, to keep coming back and keep coming back to do something that's easy, to continue to push it along, to continue, as it were, to kick the can down the road rather than stump your toe on a big heavy can. Yeah, this is not a struggle, this is not striving, but it is something we need to do over and over and over again, persistence. That in fact, this persistence has helped build up by associating with noble Dhamma friends. This is what the Sangha is really all about, is for people to help each other. And so it would be good for you to develop some Dhamma friends.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And in the worldly life, most of the people that you're around, they're not into the Dhamma, they're not into the noble Dhamma. This is one of the reasons why on the Skype group group, we have the Sangha groups, the UK group and US group. And so I would strongly recommend that you go on to these groups and start talking to the people who are on the groups already to get their noble perspective, to hear what they have to say, to hear their quotes. And then you can also start to either ask questions or start to quote your own suttas, come up with your own ideas. And so that's part of the persistence, is to have noble friends that you can share the Dhamma with.

**Speaker B:** And how do I join the— is it like a call, or— well, um.

**Speaker A:** On every one of the videos there's the link. To these groups. Okay, all the original email that I gave you, there's links to these groups. You can also, uh, um, uh, search for them on Skype.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll take a look.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can do that. Easy to find it. Just go to any one of the YouTube videos and click on those links.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Join the group.

**Speaker B:** I will.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's go ahead and finish this call. Okay, and we'll talk to you in a few days.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is that **effective meditation is about gentle, persistent remembering (Sati) and the "right noble effort"—the minimal effort needed to return to a relaxed, wholesome state—rather than striving hard for results.**

Here are the key points Dhammarato emphasizes:

**1. The Central Problem: Forgetting and Striving**
*   The main issue in practice is that we **forget** to be mindful. The purpose of *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing) is to **remember** to watch and gently control the breath to relax.
*   A major error, especially in Western/goal-oriented approaches, is **working too hard** and then **expecting results**. This leads to a cycle of striving, disappointment, and complaint.

**2. The Solution: Right Noble Effort & Attitude**
*   **Right Noble Effort** is defined as **the least amount of effort necessary** to get the job done. It's not about force, but about consistent, gentle persistence.
*   He uses the analogy of **pushing a child on a swing**: the first push requires effort, but once it's moving, only small, timely pushes are needed to maintain momentum. If you stop, you have to start again with more effort.
*   The practice is to **keep coming back**—to the breath, to relaxing the body, and to wholesome thoughts.

**3. Correcting Misunderstandings in Practice**
*   **Body Scanning** (referencing Goenka's method) is not an end in itself. Its true intention is to **find and release tension**, to make the body comfortable and relaxed.
*   **Anxiety that arises during meditation is not created by it; it is revealed.** As you relax, old, stored anxiety surfaces. The instruction is to observe it in the body, breathe into it, and watch it change and dissipate.
*   The Buddha's teaching should be **"good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end."** If a practice causes suffering (dukkha) at the start, it's off-track. True practice offers **immediate relief** by teaching you to recognize and release suffering *in the present moment*.

**4. Developing the Right Attitude (Samma Sankappa)**
*   Shift from a **victim mentality** ("trying" and failing) to a **winner's mentality** ("remembering" and doing). The key is **persistence**, not struggle.
*   Through persistent practice, you develop **confidence (saddhā)** and the **right intention/attitude**: "I can do this. I can come out of suffering." This is a foundational step on the path.
*   This attitude allows you to see reality clearly, no matter how obstructed the mind seems.

**5. The Role of Community (Sangha)**
*   **Persistence is supported by noble friends (kalyāṇamittatā).** Associating with others on the path helps maintain the right attitude and practice.
*   He encourages joining Dhamma discussion groups (like the Skype Sangha groups mentioned) to share insights and strengthen practice through community.

**In essence,** Dhammarato teaches a path of **gentle, confident, and persistent mindfulness** focused on present-moment relaxation of body and mind, leading to immediate ease and the dissolution of old suffering, rather than a future-oriented struggle for attainment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to explain meditation concepts and common pitfalls. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The Child on a Swing**
   *   **Purpose:** To explain **Right Noble Effort**.
   *   **Metaphor:** Starting meditation is like pushing a child on a swing. The initial push requires the most effort to get it moving. Once it's in motion, only small, consistent pushes are needed to keep it going. If you stop pushing entirely (stop practicing), the swing will slow down and stop, requiring another big effort to restart.
   *   **Lesson:** Effort in meditation should not be constant straining, but a **consistent, minimal, and skillful application** to maintain momentum.

### 2. **The Pile of Dirt**
   *   **Purpose:** To contrast a victim mentality with a empowered, "winner" attitude in practice.
   *   **Metaphor:** Your suffering or mental obstacles are like a pile of dirt. You can either see yourself as buried under it (a victim) or clawing your way out (struggling). The correct attitude is to **be on top of your pile of dirt** from the start.
   *   **Lesson:** The goal is to cultivate the attitude that "I've got this"—to be in charge of your mind rather than feeling overwhelmed by it.

### 3. **Kicking the Can vs. Stubbing Your Toe**
   *   **Purpose:** To redefine the quality of effort needed.
   *   **Metaphor:** Practice should be like **kicking a can easily down the road**—a persistent, light, forward-moving action. It should not be like **stubbing your toe on a big, heavy can**—a painful, jarring struggle.
   *   **Lesson:** Correct practice is about **persistence**, not **striving** or struggle.

### 4. **Anxiety as Something Revealed, Not Created**
   *   **Purpose:** To reframe the experience of anxiety during meditation.
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** When anxiety arises as you relax, it's not a *new* creation of the meditation. Instead, meditation is like **turning down the volume** on other distractions, allowing a pre-existing "low-grade anxiety" to become audible and visible.
   *   **Lesson:** The practice gives you the chance to observe and dissolve old, stored tensions, not to generate new ones.

### 5. **The Story of S.N. Goenka's Incomplete Training**
   *   **Purpose:** To explain perceived gaps in the Goenka meditation technique.
   *   **Story:** Dhammarato mentions that Goenka was **deported from Burma before finishing his training**. While it was good he taught what he knew, this story sets up the idea that his system may be missing key elements (like the full intention of *ānāpānasati* and *Right Noble Effort*), which Dhammarato later found with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.
   *   **Lesson:** Suggests that some popular systems may be incomplete, and it's important to seek out the full teachings.

### 6. **The "Good in the Beginning, Middle, and End" Litmus Test**
   *   **Purpose:** To evaluate meditation techniques.
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** He references a classic Buddhist saying that the true Dhamma is "good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end." He contrasts this with the common (and incorrect) experience where practice is **dukkha (suffering) in the beginning and middle**, with hope for relief only at the end.
   *   **Lesson:** A correct meditation practice should provide **immediate benefit and relief** ("good in the beginning"), not just be a long, arduous grind with a deferred reward.

### 7. **The Emperor of Your Own Pile of Dirt**
   *   **Purpose:** To reinforce the shift in identity and authority.
   *   **Metaphor:** Extending the "pile of dirt" metaphor, you are not a victim buried under it, but the **emperor** of it. You have sovereignty over your domain (your mind and experience).
   *   **Lesson:** Cultivate an attitude of mastery and confidence (**Sammā Saṅkappa / Right Attitude**).

### Summary of Core Themes via Metaphor:
*   **Effort:** Consistent, light persistence (swing, kicking a can) is better than hard striving (stubbing a toe).
*   **Attitude:** Shift from victim (buried under dirt) to winner/emperor (on top of it).
*   **Process:** Meditation reveals and heals old wounds (anxiety), it doesn't create new problems.
*   **Evaluation:** True practice feels beneficial immediately (good in the beginning), not just as a future promise.

These metaphors and stories work together to paint a picture of meditation as an **accessible, gentle, and immediately rewarding process** of gaining mastery over one's own mind, countering Western (and common) perceptions of it as a difficult, long-term, and effort-intensive struggle.
