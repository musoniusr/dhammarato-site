### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Does it still say it's recording? I don't know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I see the red.

**Speaker A:** It does. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, good. So what you've been up to today, dude? Brit?

**Speaker A:** Washing blankets.

**Speaker B:** Oh, nice, that's great. Sounds like a nice Nice activity, nice peaceful activity.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, where the dogs have co-opted a couch, and so they, um, they've taken over.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's awesome. Yeah, yeah, dogs are cool. Yeah, I was in, uh, I like to walk to different cemeteries and they're so beautiful. Something about a cemetery, like it's in nature, it also helps us to contemplate death and life and aging and sickness and man, I could walk around those things all day and there's such like beautiful— when the weather's permitting, there's such beautiful places to sit in the nice grass I love those places.

**Speaker A:** How's the weather where you are, Dhamma?

**Speaker B:** In Illinois today it's beautiful. Today it felt like, like, like a nice spring day. It was like amazing, almost a summer day.

**Speaker A:** What was the temperature like?

**Speaker B:** I think it only got to 50, but yeah, it felt like I went for a walk. I just was wearing my jacket. I had like a headband for my ears, but then I was just sweating after 20 minutes in, I took it off and I was like, man, that's like the lightest I've dressed all winter.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like one of the first things after I fed my animals, got going in the morning, did some Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** After that, my mom and I went on a walk, and I've been a little— in a gentle way, I've been kind of been more firm about her getting out of her room. She tends to isolate sometimes, and she enjoys herself in there. And.

**Speaker B:** That'S cool.

**Speaker A:** Two days, which is amazing here in the southern United States.

**Speaker B:** You froze it, froze a little bit for me, but I think you're back now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Can you hear us okay?

**Speaker A:** Did my wife— Yeah, I can hear you guys.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think it was going in and out a little bit. But yeah, that's cool. Self-isolation is nice. Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Yeah, but if you're having fun isolating.

**Speaker C:** Hey, I think, I think though it is nice, like, uh Yeah, to get out though, like, it can be conducive if we have the opportunity to. Yeah, the practice, that's what I'm pointing out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, fresh air, seeing nature, can't beat it. Yeah, I even like going for long walks and exercising because it's like, it makes relaxing even greater when you're tired. Yeah, so if you're lifting weights or doing any type of exercise, especially in nature, and then you come back It makes you sleep better at night. And then you're just so— I don't know, I feel like it's just part of my practice too, even though we never talk about like exercise and stuff. And I'm not sitting here like, oh, I'm some like— No, no, dude, I'm not.

**Speaker C:** Just some like healthy exercise here and there is good. Yeah, I've started actually doing like push-ups and like some back exercises and squats. So like kind of more the calisthenics. And like mixing that in there. And it's, it's kind of nice. So to just work the body out a bit, it helps with resting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. The, the motivation and inspiration to do those activities comes and goes, and we can observe that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And there's a momentum to those activities, and then there's other times where those activities, they might not come. And it's With age especially, necessarily it's the sense of effort in the beginning is it's worth pushing through sometimes with weightlifting. But as far as the restful side, Dhamma, that you pointed out, that's when you get into cardio and you're walking and the experience here, that's where it gets beneficial.

**Speaker B:** Totally.

**Speaker C:** I remember I used to— like, this was before I was practicing Buddha, Dharma, at least so explicitly— and I would go for a walk for like an hour and 40 minutes. And, you know, I was listening to music at the time, but I remember around the 50-minute mark, I would just— I would pretty much be in just like this state of joy and what have you after just walking. And that's without practicing, you know, so explicitly, right? So that was pretty, pretty cool. But yeah, it can be very conducive. I tend to go for shorter walks in the morning, and actually sometimes lately it's been more like the slow walking in the woods, but it's just getting out there is nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like the sound that my shoes make. On like gravel or like concrete, it's like after about 15 minutes of walking, I'll get into this state of just like kind of like the zone. And I'm just like, I feel like this ASMR tingling quality. Yeah, you know what I mean?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. It's like when we're in a wholesome state, like all the different sensations, they become very like almost like heightened and there's this fidelity to them, right? And so it's just like, ooh, just like just hearing the crunching of the leaves or the gravel, you know, it becomes like this really exquisite experience, right? And again, it's the most simple things, right? But it's because we're not clinging, we're not averse to anything, we can just really appreciate. Yeah, just the simple, just the easy. Yeah, just being alive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was feeling great today. I was making some Dharma videos on my YouTube channel, and I made one, but I took it down because at the time I was— I'll get into these like these patterns with myself, and I was getting into like God and expressing my like love for God, and which is fine and everything. And I was talking about vegetarianism because I was practicing vegetarianism for a little bit, but nothing crazy. I was saying you don't need to, and nobody needs to practice vegetarian if you don't want to. It's not necessary in the Dhamma whatsoever. But I was— anyways, I could see myself as I was rewatching the video to see if I needed to add any hashtags or edit it or something. I was rewatching it and I'm like, It was almost like a good practice because I can see where my thought patterns were going and I'm like, oh, you're in this state where you're still like, you're still in this chasing mindset. I could see it. I'm not always in that state, but in the video I could see that I was very much in this like, oh, you know, if I just practice a little harder, the reward is going to be in the future with God and this and that. And I'm like, And then it kind of just like dawned on me. I'm like, oh yeah, I'm like, the problem isn't the belief. The problem is it's yet another thing to chase. It's yet another thing that's taking us away from the moment here and now. Yeah, yeah, there's a wanting of if I just work a little harder, I'll get a little bit more at some future illusion time. But I caught myself after watching the video, I'm like, oh, I'm like, that's so funny how subtle that was because besides that, it was a nice Dhamma video. But when I saw that, I'm like, I'm so glad I rewatched this because I caught myself and I was like, yeah, dude, you're still in this mindset of happiness is around the corner somewhere instead of gladdening the mind here and now, following the breath, waking up to this moment here, and I could be happy here. I don't have to wait for a future spiritual place that involves God and magic and all this stuff. It's like, if there is a God, it would be like the Dhamma. It would be the present, gladdening the mind in the present moment. It doesn't have— like Jesus said, the kingdom of heaven is within you. He even said that. So it's like, I I don't know, that kind of just dawned on me, and I congratulated myself, and I was like, okay, I caught that, you know. I don't think I otherwise would have caught that if I didn't watch that video.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, that's like sound— like, that's good practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so then that state would have as its near enemy restlessness and worry, if we were to talk about that, or was it not yet quite restlessness and worry? Is my question. Or is my Wi-Fi working?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was subtle. It was subtle Dukkha. I don't know exactly what type, restlessness or what, or it was definitely just a desire for something that I didn't have in that moment. And I was using the words of God and all this magical talk, but I didn't recognize it as magical talk at the time. I didn't recognize it as desire at the time. But I'm like, I don't know, it just all kind of hit me when I watched it. I'm like, oh yeah, you were still running after something, but you didn't notice it, but it was clear upon reflection, particularly with the video camera. So I was like, huh, that's an interesting practice. I think more people should maybe just babble in front of a camera and then watch it once in a while and see what you say and be like, oh, that's an interesting thing I haven't caught myself believing or thinking that's not conducive to the Dharma or is causing me Dukkha or dissatisfaction.

**Speaker C:** But anyways, yeah, no, it's interesting because I practice a very similar thing.

**Speaker A:** So I shouldn't stop doing that.

**Speaker B:** Then?

**Speaker A:** No, maybe I should not stop doing that. I thought maybe it was conducive to super identification, but no, no, not really. Yeah, and I know what you mean, and I would like to actually, if it's okay, I'd like to check out some of your videos, Dhamma. I didn't know you had a YouTube.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's public. It's just Dhammarato. I'm reading a book right now because one of my buddies— I didn't know him particularly, but he's a guy I followed on YouTube for years who would read all these esoteric spiritual books about the Dharma, some about Advaita Vedanta, some about Hinduism and Zen, all different types of books. But one day his channel was no longer there. I don't know if it got taken down or what. So in kind of honor of him, I'm starting his like reading classics back. So I'm reading Master of Self-Realization by Sri Sadhguru Siddharameswar Maharaj. And so I just started that. I'm on like the 5th video of that. So I have an audiobook on there I'm starting, and also some Dhamma talks. Oh, hi, bud.

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** How's it going? Good, good, good. Tired, but yeah, glad I met— I just got in from work and I saw that the call was going on, so I figured I'd jump in on it. Oh nice. Yeah, we were just talking about, uh, a YouTube channel that I make with some audiobooks and some Dhamma talks. And yeah, dude, feel free to follow it if you want to, any of you guys.

**Speaker A:** But, um, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no problem.

**Speaker C:** It's good practice though.

**Speaker B:** DJ's YouTube channel is awesome too. I really have been digging your videos, DJ. I watched the second one on the Anapanasati and it was dope.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you. Yeah, it's interesting though, you talk about going back and kind of— there's a bunch of videos I made on that channel, um, where I privated them because I'm like, well, I don't really know how I feel about these ones now in terms of that. So it's like It's interesting though, because it's that practice of actually recording a Dharma talk and then going back over it. It's good practice regardless, because then you can kind of like look at, you know, go back and look at it and see how things line up, you know, and all that. And you can really somewhat, like you said, we're saying Dhamma Das, like see that subtle dissatisfaction. And it does help with the practice of being able to talk about and share it. So that's like one of, that's one of my intentions for doing a YouTube channel like that. But then also too, I'm kind of doing it a little bit of a different style with the VTubing. So that's like where you have the puppet avatar.

**Speaker B:** Anagami.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's really popular. Yeah, that's quite popular. So I'm like, that's kind of like a different sort of maybe, you know, point of being able to share the Dharma, right? So people who are kind of interested in that, kind of doing it in a fun way. But yeah, yeah, no, I'll check out your channel too, Dhammadoss. I think I've seen some of your like YouTube Shorts or what have you. You do TikTok too, right?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. Yeah, I have a TikTok too, but one of my TikToks got taken down for some reason, which is weird because I was never on it. I don't know if it technically got taken down. I still got to do some research on it. But yeah, I have some with some painting and stuff. But my main focus now is YouTube just because it's become more like a Dharma practice than anything because reading that book of Advaita Vedanta It helps me not only stay open-minded to like different types of systems leading to truth, but also it helps share. I think even though it's not Theravada, I think it's a form of Dhamma that's good to help get out there and help people because it's nothing but wholesomeness, whether people like the style or not. And also the straight-up Dhamma talks are good too, because It's also almost like therapeutic in a way too, just to put a camera in front of your face, talk about the Dharma, kind of like we're doing here. And sometimes you need to discover what you've learned so far in the Dharma or what your strengths or weaknesses are and what you could use help in. And it's hard to discover unless you're actually looking, remember to look.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's what friends can help with. Totally true, friends. So yeah, there's something I wanted to express too, um, with regard to DJ's videos. It's— it was a pleasant surprise in the experience here because it literally took me 2 years to barely get to the point where I could explain myself on Discord as far as even know if what I was doing And then to see his videos, and I'd never even heard of that media format combination, and it was calming. And on a day when a subtle hindrance was trying for me for the practice, there was subtle doubt. And really just any opportunity to check in with the breath, to return to the essentials of the practice, because the mind likes to fictionalize complexities and make up things. And often our superstition arises within an encapsulation which we don't recognize instantly. It's like Dhamma was pointing out, it does not always occur in an extreme fanciful form that we've heard about. It will occur in the form of a break that we'll be likely to see as in the guise of wholesome if our mindfulness is not functioning in the here and now, if it's leaning forward.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. If it's not about gladdening the mind right here, right now, right where we sit, then it's of no use.

**Speaker A:** And regarding Advaita Vedanta, something that I did for many years at the same time as the practice of Sila, concentration, Pañña in the Theravada framework, a lot of times the mind would— the Citta would be vibrating. With the efforts of practice or with over-efforting, or if I would get Dhamma top-heavy, I would read I Am That or I'd read Sri Ramana Maharshi, and it would calm the mind.

**Speaker B:** And they're wonderful.

**Speaker A:** The way the substitution of opposites, the way that wisdom is portrayed in those disciplines, is— it's paradoxical. But for the experience here, it was very calming at times.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the only differences that I say between Nisargadatta Maharshi and Theravada and Dhammarato's kind of method style that he teaches us that is my favorite, the only difference is that I find anyway, in my opinion, in Advaita Vedanta, especially from Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta Maharaj, they say there's no self, just like the Buddhists do. But then as far as their true nature goes, they also say there's an absolute self or the Atman. And When I read Buddhadasa's book, Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree, where he talks about Anatta, and he talks a lot about voidness, it reminds me of how the Advaita Vedantins would think of the Atman. Only Buddhadasa Bhikkhu might call it voidness or Anatta. He might use those two words to describe it, but it's just like tomato, tomato to me. Sure, we can find differences in the styles, absolutely. But what good does that do us? Like, let's find the common ground, which there's plenty of. There's plenty of it in real Christianity if you really listen to Jesus's message. There's plenty of it in— yep, plenty of it in Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, even atheism or scientific-minded people. You know, there's all kinds of common ground. And it's basically like compassion. Don't fuck with other people, they won't fuck with you. Try to— try the best you can to be a good person, and that automatically is like the Eightfold Path, kind of automatically gladdening the mind here and now and bearing all the fruits from that practice, whatever it may be, you know.

**Speaker A:** Ultimately, the fruit is the enjoyment Yeah, we're excited for the next opportunity to do good deeds.

**Speaker B:** Totally.

**Speaker A:** We enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Yeah, you become— go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Regardless of the immensity of the mess.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and life can be sometimes messy, but then you enjoy to— you enjoy to be messy and and then it becomes perfect. You know, if you make a mountain out of a molehill, it quickly seems to become a mountain. But if you could look at everything as just a little tiny molehill, like you'll be chilling and then the baby Dukkhas that I like to call them, like Dhammarato says, the baby plants of the little Dukkhas when they first arrive, if you don't pluck them out right away, They grow to be big oak trees, it seems like. So we get in the habit of remembering to look throughout our day and about, "Wait, is there any baby Dukkhas here?" We pluck them out. And then after you do that, you come back to the breath, you come back to the moment, noticing the breath, noticing if it's long or short or whatever. And then you get into a type of Samadhi type state where, oh, this is peaceful, this is nice, whatever you want to call it. You get into a really nice peaceful state, but ultimately it doesn't last because we're humans, partly, mostly. And then the baby Dukkhas come and we rinse and repeat like Dhammarato says. And why do we practice? After I was watching DJ's video, I was thinking about this. I'm like, I like putting things into a little different words. I'm like, why do we practice Anapanasati? What's the point? It's not to get some future pleasure. It's not to change the past, which is impossible. We practice observing the breath because it's reality here and now, and it's wholesome. And when we are focusing on this wholesome aspect of reality, the breath, it's the one last thing we can enjoy that is just given to us freely. And if we're not given the breath, then as Dhammarato says, then our problems are over, then we're dead. If you don't have the breath, then you're probably dead, floating around with Jesus or whoever, Allah, whatever you want to say. Nothing is whatever. But yeah, that's funny talking about metaphysics. It's like, I think sometimes in Buddhism we say like You know, the Buddha, it's not like he was against God or against a soul. He just knew it was yet another delusion that takes you away from being joyous here and now. It's not that he's against these things or didn't— he didn't know, he didn't care. He was only interested in Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, getting rid of suffering here and now.

**Speaker C:** That's it.

**Speaker B:** And you could call it by any name. If we're getting rid of suffering here and now, it could be the way, the Holy Spirit, the Atman, the universe, nature, whatever. And yeah, call it whatever you like. And, uh, that way we're, we're all like, like, uh, Dhammarato said, we're all kings. Of our own pile of dirt we're standing on. You know, nothing to worry— if we're satisfied, there's no enlightenment. The question of if I'm enlightened or not enlightened doesn't even arise because you're satisfied. There's no like, oh, am I an Arhat? Am I an Arahant? Am I this? Am I that? Am I going to go to heaven? Am I going to go to hell? These questions don't even arise because you're satisfied. There's no question of is DJ better than me, am I better than DJ, am I better than Brett, is the Buddha better than me. Doesn't— these questions don't even arise. It's just pure satisfaction.

**Speaker C:** The satisfaction. I do like when, you know, talking about other folks and comparisons is also to come back to the point that, hey, we are all beyond compare, right? We're beyond comparison. Comparison is futile. It leads to dissatisfaction. It also leads to— and this isn't like seeking a future thing, super hardcore— but it does lead to a complacency, right? Because then we say, oh, we're better than this person, and then we, we, we don't actually spend the time, or we don't take that moment to wake up and return back home to the breath. Because that's really the skills that we're developing, is to come back and recognize the end of dissatisfaction here and now, just to do that again and again. But if we're comparing ourselves to others, that's not going to be conducive to that. So it's helpful to come back to, no, we're all beyond compare. It's futile.

**Speaker A:** It's futile to compare. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And the, uh, the Anatta helps with that too, because it's like, who are we comparing ourselves with? Yeah, you know, it's just a fiction.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we have that idea that forms up of that, you know, self there, and it's like, no, even that is not— even whatever, whatever arises, that's not self.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but yeah, I like what you're saying, Dhammarato. I think it's, it's very helpful or very beneficial because you know, people will kind of get into that argument of Anatta versus Atman, right? But, and one way we can look at it is that the thing here with the Buddha, Dharma, is that it's a very, very precise, thorough way of kind of recognizing that. Because I mean, Dhammarato even says we're a moving target, right? So there's that aspect where it's like whatever that self is, we can't pinpoint it down. But like, one of the things that the Buddha aligns is he says, no, none of the five clinging aggregates are self. We're not going to find self, a permanent separate self, in those five clinging aggregates. Well, I think that even with the Vedanta, right, they would— it would be a similar thing. It's neti neti neti, not this, not that. Whatever arises, yeah, is not, not it. So.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, neti neti neti. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, or right now rather, it's just about being satisfied with the way things are.

**Speaker C:** No, that is true, because we can go off on that whole thing trying to— yeah, trying to find like you know, that permanent separate self, or we can try to get rid of that, right? But at the end of the day, the real question is not that. It's like, are we satisfied? So I think the teaching of anatta is helpful in service to that. But if we kind of get too wrapped up in that, we start seeking a mystical experience of anatta. That's when there becomes— where we become dissatisfied, right? Because we want to get something. So that's a helpful thing I find.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and ironically, all the mystical, magical, spiritual bag of goodies that people are after, in a weird way, ironically, can be found when you stop searching for all that crazy shit.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's fun. That's a— yeah, it's funny. It's like, you know, yeah, it's like.

**Speaker B:** The practicality, the realism of it, the simplicity of it, of coming back to the breath in the present moment, knowing that everything's okay right where we sit.

**Speaker A:** Right where we are.

**Speaker B:** If that's not magic, I don't know what is, but that's the real magic. That's the real miracle.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is the Sati, is the Anapanasati, is the Eightfold Path.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is it gladdening the mind?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's— no, but that's the real magic that's free from superstition, free from, uh, you could say the supernatural aspects, like, you know, just gladdening the mind, you know, uh, directing the mind towards— like, if even if we're visualizing as a way to gladden the mind, right? But these are all things that we can do. But if it's like, oh no, I'm going to do this specific— like, you know, people— if people are into magic, like this specific ritual so that, you know, my ex-boyfriend so that his car gets totaled or something, you know. I mean, there's ill will in that, right? We could have a more beneficial thing like I'm gonna cast a spell in.

**Speaker A:** Order to— quite a bit.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, to, uh, to, I don't know, make it so this one orphanage has a lot of money, something like a little bit more, uh, more in that direction. But there's still that thing of like wanting to do something where it's probably not gonna really resolve in that thing, right? But if we're like, oh, okay, you know what, we're going to direct the mind towards the wholesome, then it's like, cool.

**Speaker A:** I have this superstition I have to confess that comes up here in the practice sometimes. I think this is a good time to do so. The superstition that comes up here, it's an insidious one. It's a superstition that I can't do this. And when that happens, that's serious.

**Speaker B:** Can't do what?

**Speaker A:** The practice.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that happens. That happens to you personally.

**Speaker A:** Appreciate this very breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's doubt.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, doubt is a superstition, and it's, uh, it's a horrible fetter, but it's— the good news is it's easily overcome. Because yes, you don't have doubt. Your brain has doubt, and DJ's brain, everybody's brain. If you're a human, naturally doubt, this thing called doubt, will arise. But it's not your doubt, it's not my doubt, it's the body's doubt. It's a natural process.

**Speaker A:** It's ownerless.

**Speaker B:** That ownerless, yeah. And because of that You don't even have to be free of it because you practice coming back to the breath. Sure, that doubt may be in the body, and you could say, "Hello, my friend doubt.".

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Hello. The word may arise in mind, "Oh, I can't do this," but then you just switch it from "I can't do this" to "Oh, fuck yeah, I can do this. I know I can.".

**Speaker A:** That's right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. It's really cool. I find it helpful and beneficial, especially with doubt is to be like, aha, glad to see you doubt. And because we can't doubt that there's doubt, we're already practicing because by the recognition of it, and by putting in something wholesome like that, we're already gladdening the mind. So I find that to be really helpful with doubt. Where same thing with boredom too. It's like we play a game with them of spot them, and that game is, you know, it becomes fun. It's like, oh cool, we can see that there's doubt in the mind and it's already starting to change. We're already practicing. So it's, yeah, but yeah, doubt is one to overcome. Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker B:** Doubt is just nothing more but another beautiful plant. It's another beautiful plant in the mind. And if you don't want it there, you just like you saw it, you remembered to look, you saw that doubt and said, that's not my doubt. That's the body's doubt. Everybody gets that once in a while. And if you come back to the breath, that thing, it just changes. Go back to the breath and it fades away like a cloud in the sky.

**Speaker C:** Goodbye doubt.

**Speaker B:** And it will return. Yeah, it will return. But that's okay. It's nothing to be scared of.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's where the like, I see, you know, like the aha, I see you, because I see you is already distancing yourself from the doubt. It's already being like on top of it. It's like we're seeing it now. We're not the doubt. We're not in the doubt. Where, oh, okay, now we can see that, see that doubt's arising. And because it arises, it'll cease. But also it's already started to break up. There's already been a wholesome change.

**Speaker B:** And not many people can even make it to that step where you've been able to recognize that you have that. And you just told us, hey, I have something to say. Sometimes I feel like I can't do this. So basically what you're saying is sometimes you practice well because you're recognizing Right. And congratulating yourself, hey, I recognize that doubt.

**Speaker A:** It arises as defilement, it arises, it's seen. Even if it makes another go, it's seen as Anicca. That's another way to practice. I was telling DJ an anecdote about that, an occurrence this week, and went ahead and went about my duties in spite of the coming and going of this sense of needles and pins in the body, which eventually revealed itself to be doubt, but not right away. And without telling an excessive story about it, without burdening others, I went ahead and carried out duties of the day. And at the end of the day, it was a victory. Anicca arose. Woke up feeling like, okay, kit in mind. But yeah, I see you, I spot it, I see you, Mara, and it was okay.

**Speaker B:** There you go. Yeah, that's the whole practice.

**Speaker A:** Hot dog.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, congratulations though. Yeah, for responding that, and then also for opening up here, you know, and not being like, oh, you know, I'm beyond that. Just to be like, hey, no, you know what, this does come up up sometimes. Like, sometimes, like, it's interesting because it's not so much the doubt, I would say, of where it's on even a level of view of looking at things. So it's not like the third fetter, but it's almost more just like momentarily, like you were saying, Dhammarato, because we're human. Because it's— well, we don't have doubt necessarily, these are the aggregates. So it's part of the Samskara basis, but we're more skilled at being able to see it as time goes on. But sometimes, you know, if we haven't been practicing or what have you, it'll come up. Or even if we have, it'll just whatever due to causes and conditions, it will arise. But the cool thing with Anapanasati and this practice is we just, we get skilled at being able to see it. So that doubt that might have had us spin for hours or days becomes a very momentary thing, and it's really good. Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker A:** And an ardency arose in the practice, and the days following. And it's— the temptation arose even to take credit for that. And it became clear that, well, taking upon an attitude of a winner as the forerunner, and then just a gentle inclining the mind toward more Anapanasati. And then as the next two days subsequent to when those events were perceived, its practice began to become more joyful. It became easier, and more Anapanasati occurred in the practice. And this is— that's great.

**Speaker B:** It's very— yeah, that's wonderful. That's what— that's why we're here, for just to experience, to practice what you just said. Some things, whether it's anger, fear, doubt, whatever, these things arise and we remember to look in a balanced way throughout our day that we see the baby Dukkha. Aha, I see you, Mara. Transform it with our actions and speech and wholesomeness. And this nurturing wholesome speech and actions transform these things into the beautiful blissful Samadhi type of state. And then of course the baby Dukkhas will come back, just like they came back for the Dukkha. On his deathbed, he even had pain in the stomach and he says, "Aha, I see you, Mara." And he recognized it and he changed it, just like he told us to do. Thank God for that, or else I'd be addicted to drugs or something if it wasn't for the Buddha. I'm appreciative to him for that.

**Speaker A:** I'd be dead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'd probably be dead too, man.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** No, very, very grateful for the teachings of the Buddha and also the fact that he sat under the Bodhi tree for all those hours and practiced things like hardcore asceticism and came to the conclusion that, oh, wait a minute. We don't need to do that. You know, he rediscovered or discovered the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, right? So it's really, it's wonderful to be, you know, in a time when they are accessible.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the first gem of the Triple Gem. Yeah, the second gem is what's happening here with Dhamma friends, noble friends. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, totally.

**Speaker A:** The second gem is the Dharma we discussed. The third gem is this friendship, these friendships, this assembly we have. I'm sorry.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, it's great. Yeah, it's something that is missing because even in the Buddhist community, it's hard to find people practicing what Dhammarato has so generously taught us, the Noble Dharma. You know, it's hard to find people like Dhammarato or others in this Sangha. They're not out there. They're not even sometimes in the Buddhist communities. But we've gathered together here, thank goodness. And hopefully it's not about quantity, it's about quality. So even if we're little in numbers on these calls, that's okay, because the quality is pure gold, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker B:** And by nature, we also are just social creatures, so the Buddha was really wise in just being like, hey, this is kind of your nature, so get together anyway with this wonderful thing called the Dharma, and it'll just like, it'll just boost everything. Like Pfizer, it'll give us all boosters. That's what the— yeah, the Buddha's like the doctor, the, uh, the Dhamma's like the medicine, Sangha's like the nurses, hospital. Yeah. Yeah, walking in silence is really— one time when I was sick a while back, I lost my voice, and it was such an interesting experience because I lost it for like a solid month. But it was so amazing to me how little actually needs to be said and how much is said just purely for entertainment, you know? How much is said meaninglessly? And when I lost it, I was just like— I remember reflecting on that and being like, so many of the problems of this world just stem from boredom. People just can't be satisfied in the moment. They start to get bored. And they cause all kinds of problems. Kind of like idle hand is the devil's playground. It's like, if you can't be content right where you are, right where you sit, you're gonna go fuck around and cause a whole bunch of problems.

**Speaker A:** That's right.

**Speaker B:** And I think one Zen teacher said, if we could only learn to sit in a room quietly and be satisfied, the world would be such a better place. For this reason and this reason alone, there's all this trouble everywhere. Wars and shit. But yeah, I had a friend message me who is a very beautiful, uh, spiritual teacher, um, and she was telling me how she was not feeling really good about the state of the world. I feel like she was having a little bit maybe of Dukkha. And I was just like, you know, what state of the world? Sure, I know that there's wars going on. Sure, I know that things aren't ideal. If I could wave a magic wand, I would like the world to be a way better place, but that's not reality. So is there wars going on that I wish weren't going on? Sure, of course, I have a heart. But at the same time, Like Ram Dass says, what good does it do to dwell on these things that we can't control? It does no good for us and no good for those suffering in the war. So in the many wars throughout the world. So if an opportunity arises to change those things, of course, take it, change it if you can. But if not, there's no need to beat our heads into the ground, lamenting, crying, I wish we could change the world. You know, the world's been around a long time and it's never had any shortage of war, famine, or any of these things. It's quite a natural process.

**Speaker A:** How do you feel, Dhamma, about— may I ask how you feel about assertions made by, for instance, Ajahn Sona, that our sociopolitical, or our world is returning to a state similar to that of the time of the Buddha?

**Speaker B:** I'm not too familiar with how the world was in during the time of the Buddha, but if I could make an educated guess, I would probably say it's not too much different than, than the things going on today. A lot of times Our egos like to think this is the only time in the whole history of the world that things have been this bad. But no, I think as long as— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When we let egos contract.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. As long as there's been humans on earth, you guarantee there's been corruption, war, and all the good and horrible things that come with being a human. It's not changed. Maybe the style has changed. Maybe the chariots have turned into tanks. But that's about it. The planes have turned into drones, the soldiers have turned into AI computers, but essentially it's basically the same shit, different day.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's a nurturing realization.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's calming.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, because when we take life so personally, when we take life like it's just this almost like a movie, like a film, and we're the stars of the show. We suffer accordingly to all the slings and arrows that those stars of those shows suffer. Yeah, they go, there's a war and I have to save the whole world. It's like, good luck, you're going to be fighting a downhill, uphill battle, whatever the saying is. It's like you're going to be up against a wall. Oh yeah, if you try to— yeah, because with their base When we try to save the world, what we're basically saying is that reality isn't Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. And that's a battle you can't win.

**Speaker A:** We're asserting dissatisfaction when we do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. We need to see reality with wisdom. We need to see it with what it really is, which is Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. Nothing worth holding on to that's going to cause dissatisfaction. It doesn't mean that you have to enjoy the wars or want the war. No, of course we're human. We don't want the wars. If we could do something, we would change it. But ultimately, we don't have that power. We don't have that control.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Reality is reality. Things are the way they are. And the sooner we can accept this and gladden our minds right here, right now, thereby we can become a light that helps to bring goodness, more goodness, more Sukkha, less Dukkha to the world. And that is a change that you can make. People have made, and we're actually doing it right in this moment.

**Speaker A:** And that brightens the world, and that brightens the experience, let's say, of others.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. It's brightened my day already just talking with you guys.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, this comes back to something that was very poignant that Dhammarato told me. Oh, this is on a group call, I know, you know, about caring for as opposed to caring about. Because if we care about the world and we have this conception of the world, which is this place with all this, you know, horrible stuff going on and we need to fix it, then, you know, we're going to be dissatisfied and we're going to latch on to it and we're going to worry. And we actually, from that point, are not going to be able to, you know, care for the world in this moment, right? Because we're distracted. So what's beautiful with this practice is we come back and we care for and we can abide, you know, relaxed, joyful, and satisfied. But then too, when the opportunity does arise where we are amongst other people, we can gladden up, we can gladden them up, or we can talk about things in a skillful way so that we're not, you know, rather than being super selfish about it too, like Oh my gosh, there's this war going on or what have you and poor, you know, me. It's rather, no, we can pull that back and be like, hey, we can talk about this in a responsible way. But also we understand that ultimately Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, and we can come back to this breath because this is the secure refuge. Because we could be living, you know, we are in some way when we recognize it, especially where we are when we're in safety and security and there are We're not like, thank goodness right now I don't have bombs dropping around me, so I can appreciate that. But, you know, we can actually come back and notice that we can appreciate it. And then from that point, too, we can talk about these things with a level head if we do, if we do feel inclined towards, like, talking about them. But most of the time we can actually avoid it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't have to be swept away, because if we are swept away by it, we're not going to be able to actually care for what's going on in this moment.

**Speaker A:** You know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, with the people that were around. Yeah, to actually have that peace, to have that joy, to have that satisfaction. Yeah, to recognize it. Oh yeah, that's what I was going to say, because we could be living in a literal, like, paradise, heaven kind of thing, where everything on that level is quote-unquote perfect, if our mind is not sorted out, we will be— we could be dissatisfied. I mean, this is why rich people are incredibly dissatisfied a lot of the time, you know. They can have all the cars, money, and wealth, but it doesn't matter. If you're— if you still have greed, if you still have ill will, you know, the hindrances, delusion, you're going to be dissatisfied. So this is— I mean, again, I wouldn't trade the Buddha, Dharma, and the knowledge here for anything in the world. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** There comes a time, there comes a point when we see these things that our practice literally leaps off the page. It gains another dimension, it gains relief. It gains relief as in like a relief map where it's not just two-dimensional. And when we come into that type of reality It's not invisible. Our practice, the benefit shows up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the fruits are real. The fruits are— it reminds me of what Frank Zappa said about music. He's like, music is the only religion that delivers the goods. But I have a follow-up. I think the Dharma is the only practice that delivers the goods.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, with this degree of thoroughness, like, that's why I appreciate the Dharma so much. It is so thorough, and by that I mean it is so complete, like no stone left unturned. Yeah, yeah, in terms of the other day Yeah, in terms of like dissatisfaction, understanding, okay, dissatisfaction and the end of dissatisfaction, because we talk about that on the very subtle level perhaps sometimes, and that's where that using the word dissatisfaction is helpful. Or even like the more you could say where we might use a word like suffering to describe it, like we become sick, the body becomes, you know, in this, in that sort of, there's that pain or what have you, but we know how to manage it, we know how to see it, we know how to penetrate through through it, and it relieves so much stress, so much pain, so much worry, so much dissatisfaction as we just continue to practice. And again, even right here, right now, it's like a day practicing like this, you know, one experiences probably more satisfaction and joy than some people do in their entire lives. Like, that's it. And the fact that, no, this isn't just us talking about and talking about this with like zero basis. It's like, no, coming back to the reflection that no, this is actually real. Like, this is real. And that kind of comes to that point where it's like, it's mind-blowing, but not to become bewildered by it. That's why coming back to the simple wow of it is so helpful when we don't have words to describe it.

**Speaker A:** And that's the inspiration piece. And our practice will benefit from this continually. And then, you know, it's when we read the suttas— I was looking at the Majjhima Nikaya, and another Sangha member had invited that I read MN 64. And at the end of it, and at the end of many of the suttas, the Bhikkhus come to the Buddha with questions. And it's not that necessarily restlessness has arisen, but maybe in some, in the practice of some it did. We don't know. It's not discussed to that detail necessarily every time. But at the end of the sutta in MN 64, the sutta was aimed at Ananda, a question that Ananda had for the Buddha. And you can read this sutta for yourself, but at the end of it Ananda heard the words of the Buddha and he was satisfied with what the Buddha had said. And this is the experience that we have here. This is the experience that occurs here in the practice where any number of uncertain feelings could arise, or it could be doubt, or it could be something, or it could just be checking in with the Sangha. It is something that nurtures the practice experience here.

**Speaker B:** It's— yeah, it helps us remember.

**Speaker A:** There can be discomfort on approaching because, you know, one knows one is going to be accountable. And it's like I tried to express in a text to DJ today on Discord, gratitude for an experience of friendship that perhaps has not occurred in this life. Where there is a simultaneous comfort and nurturing, while at the same time a knowing that I can't just let my mind go willy-nilly and just say anything. I'm going to get called on it. And that is something deeply wonderful.

**Speaker C:** No, I think, yeah, thank you though, Brett, and Dhamma Dasa too. Like, just having friends who, you know, wise friends, is wonderful. And to be able to discuss the Dhamma and also have a chance to be able, again, with those interactions, being able to talk. Because for me, one of my things is I will be very— sometimes I will be more like hands-off, like not stepping in, just more listening. But being able to sometimes, you know, bring something up just as a point that might be helpful, you know, and not being so like— like having the courage to do that, I think, is definitely beneficial because, yeah, you might just— I agree.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've experienced that too. And it's— there's been so many— it's like I've been a sincere— I feel like In memory and in the history of the practice, there has been years of wholesome stuff and benefit. But over the last two, since encountering the teachings of Dhammarato and then looking at his teacher— whenever I find inspiration from Dharma teachers, I always try and do some research and see what their teachers had to say and if they published anything, if they have Dhamma talks I can find. And of course Dhammarato is always enthusiastic about the teachings of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. So I would have encountered those no matter what upon seeing Dhammarato's videos. But yeah, so it's just been this experience of real Sangha. And this is the first time— I mean, I've had teachers before, I've watched Dhamma talks, I've read books, I've practiced, and my practice has been as sincere as I could make it. And of course, ardency comes and goes like the rest of the faculties and factors. But again, this experience of true friendship and a friendship that is new and it is worthwhile.

**Speaker B:** Especially in this culture, because this culture will do everything in its power to make you feel like crap. And to tear you apart so you can buy more of this, buy more of that, get a gym membership, get makeup, get better clothes, get better house. It's designed for Dukkha. It's a Dukkha machine. So it's such a relief when we're practicing and we say, I'm not a fucking loser. I am a winner. I am a king because all these people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Thinking that they can take all this material wealth to the grave, thinking that it will have some benefit other than Dukkha, and they're wrong. Yeah, I've been there. I've tried. Look at all the actors and actresses, all addicted to drugs, all having crazy relationship divorces. Johnny Depp and his chick, all these things. And it's not like they're bad people or anything, but they're just misguided. And it doesn't make them better or worse than me, but I just wish they had somebody as well who can help them to gladden their minds and to be like, "No, dude, the rat race is bullshit. You're enlightened already. You're Buddha already. You're a winner. You're a king. You're a queen. You're a princess to the girls watching. You're all that stuff already. It's your birthright. It's there." But we can only stop giving this delusion all our attention, this past and this future, this ego attention, and come back to the breath and say everything's okay. You know, there's no more races to run. There's nothing to do or not do or to like or dislike or to be or become. I'm fine. For once in my life, finally I'm fine right now. What a pleasure that is. What a release of all the bullshit of this horrible society. I know I should say it's not horrible, but I'm just going with the flow. But you know, it's just such a release.

**Speaker A:** And there's only 3 people in this call, and, um, it's hard to see. Easy for you to see, but it's hard for most to see. Subtle. Yes, that's the advice.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's where it's really helpful to, you know, interact with the Sangha and to have that support, you know. Um, yeah, because it can be— this is— and, and, and it's not to not continue to keep looking, because it's wise to keep looking and discerning, right? But not to be so swept away by like worldly things, because folks will kind of, you know, that it's just the way— it's just the misguided thing, right? But to get swept away by that and to recognize, no, no, no, that's not— that's not actually what's going to be beneficial. That's not what's beneficial right here, right now, either, um, as all these different worldly things, you know, vanity and what have you, all these things that folks care about so much. And to be able to see that and be be like, nope, we don't need to go there. You know, we don't need to be swept away by the worldly. You know, in Dhamma Das, when you were saying— well, there's two things to like to touch on, but the one thing that you just said too about like, you know, kind of being like, okay, it's horrible, or what have you, when it comes to the world, like there's a certain degree where it's like, yeah, but then you kind of corrected.

**Speaker A:** It a little bit.

**Speaker C:** But I mean, like in terms of like, yeah, not having so much an aversion, but also still being able to see No, yeah, yeah, no, but yeah, what I'm saying is we can see it's a big old pile of crap because this is— it's all Anicca, it's all Dukkha, right? That's the point, is it's all this junk that— and, and the Buddha says this all the time. He says this about the body and stuff as well. This is actually helpful to reflect upon from time to time or to come back to because it helps us to become less immersed in that aspect of it, to see the actual peril. The world in that regard, Samsara, is perilous, or there's peril there. So to be wise to that, to recognize it again and again, that the— what will you just lend it to? Oh, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Living in the lay life as we do, it's even— what you're saying is even more, I think, important for us.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Listen to that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, precisely. So that's why this Sangha, like, coming in is very helpful. Because yeah, the world in that regard, Samsara, the cyclic existence is perilous. And so, yeah, but what you were talking about, Dhamma Das, when you were kind of doing almost that guided thing, which is really nice, because when we practice that, and we all come together, and we take that moment to be like, yeah, you know, if we haven't been, to actually come back in to breathe and to direct the mind towards those wholesome thoughts. But yeah, to recognize that, that sense and the joy that comes from a wholesome state of mind, the satisfaction that comes from a wholesome state of mind, completely blows away anything that's worldly. Just, it just triumphs over it. It tramples it in terms of it. If one directly sees and knows it, that's just the way that it is. However, it's from that because then people will worry, be like, oh no, what if I don't do anything or what have you? Or what if I become selfish and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah? No, actually, if we arrive, if we come to the world from that place, you know, Jesus says, right, be in the world but not of it. But if we come to that place from that satisfaction, we can be of more service. We can come from a place of joy and wanting to share the joy and all of that stuff from a place of not wanting really anything, right?

**Speaker A:** We'll have more energy for that. We'll have more energy for wholesome behavior and activities.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Oh yes, the other thing I wanted to touch on too that you were talking about, Dhamma Dassa, that was really poignant when you kind of were bringing up celebrities and stuff and you said, well, they're not bad people, they're just misguided. And that's the beautiful thing about the Dharma is we see the reality in that really the reason that people do unskillful things is because they're ignorant, is because they're delusional. If they weren't ignorant or delusional, and then that leading to greed and hatred, they wouldn't be doing those things. And again, because if one tastes and understands that freedom from the— from dissatisfaction, that freedom from the unwholesome, and abides in a wholesome state of mind right, and knows that and knows the fruits of that, they recognize that. Because again, if you're going and acting very unskillfully, it's going to be more difficult to do that. So one abstains from doing those kinds of activities because, well, of course, it's kind of a wise form of selfishness in a sense, but it's not true selfishness in that regard. But it's actually, if you're going to be truly, you know, what is actually beneficial for me, for moi, is actually beneficial for everyone and vice versa, right? It's not— they're not in conflict anymore because we've become friends with, you know, ourselves, but also friends with the greater whole, right? With the— we could say the world, but perhaps in a much more interconnected way and less in a cyclic existence way. But we even see, you know, we see that and we're not So averse to it, but we see the peril in getting caught up in any one of these things so we can proceed with wisdom as opposed to ignorance. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Totally, man.

**Speaker A:** We can love the unlovable, as Dipa Ma said.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. There are no unlovable. Everybody's lovable.

**Speaker A:** That's what she meant.

**Speaker B:** Even Trump. Yep, that's it. Deepa Ma is amazing. Even Biden, even Trump, caught in aggregates.

**Speaker A:** I remember the pain of being caught in the aggregates.

**Speaker B:** Ram Dass one time had a practice where— I don't know who the politicians were at his time, but the Trumps of his time were like Reagan or something.

**Speaker A:** Nixon.

**Speaker B:** But he Yeah, Nixon. He actually would add their pictures to his little shrines. And he would pray to them. And he said, "I hated these guys, but I made it my practice to like, to show such compassion and praise to them so that maybe I could just get balanced out with them." And I was like, "Wow, that's a cool practice.".

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Amazingly true.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, that's the cool thing is we don't have to hate anyone. This is a very helpful insight because it's like we recognize that it comes from ignorance. Now, does this mean that we have to regard everything that they say as wise? No, we can see that these actions, this speech, this is unwise and it leads to the harm of themselves and others. Right? But it's not that we're just like, okay, we take that, we get a little impersonal with it, and we discern what is wholesome versus unwholesome. And when we see somebody, you know, kind of going a lot of unwholesome directions, doesn't mean we love them in the sense that we have to agree with everything. No, actually, part of that love, part of that friendship, part of that Metta is being able to recognize that it's unskillful. But at the same time, we recognize, well, there's a being there that's suffering due to, you know, various different things. So we have compassion, we have understanding, understanding, but we don't have to— we don't have to be like, oh yeah, you know what, I have to listen to every single thing that this dictator said, or what have you. It's like, no, they're an utter fool, right? And other— because calling that, um, that utter fool aspect, at least in those regards, is coming from a place of compassion, right? So it's coming from a place of understanding, but it's not from a place so much of conceit. Again, it's just being like, well, no, that that is foolish, it leads to harm. And then, yeah, sometimes though, when I do talk to people and I use the word fool, they're like, that's too soft. And that's like, well, actually, I think it's quite poignant in the way that I'm talking about it. Yeah, but it— yeah, yeah, but it's interesting because there's so much where it's like, you know, if you don't hate this thing, right, if you don't have hatred in your heart, then you're not a good person because you should hate the bad thing. It's like, no, you don't need to hate that. You can see that it's unwholesome and it's not helpful, and that's it. And then you don't have that, you know.

**Speaker B:** Like Jesus said, don't resist evil with evil. Yeah, just because somebody does evil to you, it doesn't give us the right to then do evil to them. Yeah, but we show them compassion, love, nurturing. And it's so funny, it's also fractal. Yeah, you know, it's like, uh, we show others compassion, love, forgiveness, and we show it to ourselves. The neurons in our brains change, the energy in the room changes, the people's attitudes change. Everything's great. It's like one— it's like, you know, when Jesus says— they come to Jesus and they say, yo, I did this sin, I did all these sins, I'm horrible. And he would just say I tell you, you're forgiven. Now go forth and sin no more. It's like, if that's not the kingdom of heaven, what is? That's the Eightfold Path. It's like, oh, I made a mistake. You are forgiven. Just don't go out there purposely trying to do it again. Learn from it and change it and go forth and sin no more. And of course, because we're human, we're going to sin little sins again here and there, but we're not meaning to. And when we do, we forgive ourselves. And it's like, Jesus would forgive you for any sin if you were earnest in your apology. And that's kind of the message, is that you're already in heaven, you know? So act accordingly. And if you mess up, never mind, start again. And you're never out of heaven. That's part of heaven, is never mind, start again.

**Speaker C:** Never mind, start again. You know, it's interesting bringing that up too, because the Buddha does say like the exact same thing in terms of hatred will never cease by hatred. You know, hatred ceases by friendship or love, right? And that's from like the Dhammapada. So yeah, it's cool to see the parallels and how like things, you know, the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of Buddha, you know, can be quite in line. And that's sort of the nice thing too, because so similar. Yeah, for us in North America too, um, we do have a bit, for the most part, you know, a Christian background, right? So being able to, I think, incorporate that into our practice is actually quite helpful. And it also helps to get over— if somebody is a little bit more of the mindset of they have perhaps a bit of a baggage with those things or what have you, it kind of is helpful to overcome the aversion to that, like to overcome aversion to Christianity. We can see the pitfalls of particular sects or not so much, you know, how people can go with it, you know, perhaps with like the megachurches or like certain prosperity gospels. And we can see that, oh yeah, this kind of can be unwholesome. But generally speaking, the teachings of Jesus can be quite wholesome. And so being able to come back to that and not be so divisive and be like, oh well, you know what, I'm a Buddhist, I can't go in, I can't talk about any of this, I have to be a devout Buddhist teaching, and it's like, no.

**Speaker B:** Do you know, you know, a quick story I heard? I don't know if any of this is true, but it sounds awesome. I heard a story that the Dalai Lama said they recently found some scriptures that were ancient somewhere in their library that said how Jesus had all that missing time between when he was a kid until about the age of 33 or something. He said like he found something. I'm just— I don't know if this is true, but take it with a grain of salt. But I believe he said they found scriptures that said the three wise men that visited Jesus in the manger were actually like Tibetan Buddhist monks, lamas, who would come and do that little test to see if the baby was a lama because they studied the stars and all their magical thinking and stuff. And they got there, saw that that was the case, brought them gifts, brought them gold and myrrh and all this stuff, and then took the child with them back to Nepal or wherever, raised him as a lama. Then after he was done, he went back and taught everybody the Buddhist ways. But I don't know if that's true, but I'm like, man, that's such a cool story. That's such a tradition, you know, to take the child and see if he'd bring gifts to the family and I'm like, wow, that kind of makes sense. Yeah, no, that's good. To me anyway.

**Speaker C:** Is it possible that the three wise men were llamas? And if so— I'm sorry, I've been— my dad is really into watching Oak Island and the various different history shows, and they always have that pattern where the announcer's like, is it possible that aliens created the pyramids? And if so, you know, that's like my inner voice.

**Speaker B:** I mean, look at my shirt. Oh yeah, you got the UFO with Bigfoot.

**Speaker C:** I actually— I got a mug there.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, I like, I like a lot of the paranormal stuff. Even though I don't necessarily like practice it with the Dharma.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I do enjoy, uh, hearing stories about it and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Something that was interesting, I was listening to AM radio one night, and it's a common effect, especially if you listen to like sports commentary. Oh nice, because it just, it goes on and on and on and pretty soon. Yeah, myself, that I'm fine and I'm asleep.

**Speaker B:** I love radio.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I tuned into what used to be the Art Bell Show, his Coast to Coast.

**Speaker B:** My wife and I listened to his old episodes on Spotify all the time.

**Speaker A:** And my wife was there listening to it with me. And a guy came on who had just published a book, and he was talking nonstop, and he talked for about 45 minutes, and actually stayed, stayed not asleep, stayed awake for this. And he outlined this great big map he had of reality, and it had all this historical perspective. And he had these beliefs that he described of aliens coming down, as well as angels mating with humans and angel-human hybrids. And it got very, very complex. It went around to Egypt, it went global, it went out into outer space beyond Andromeda and all these places and dimensions and quantum mechanics. And he just managed to tie about everything, every bit of mental proliferation and papranca you could imagine. And it was great, great fun. And right before I was about to change frequencies, He, you know, began to wonder if maybe he just was never going to stop talking. He brought it back to almost the present. I think it was he brought it to the present moment and he said, really what I'm trying to do with all these theories and with my book is I'm trying to just point out that we could easily just get along on this planet and all the groundwork's been done for us. And my wife woke up and said, wow, he really pulled this, pulled this, pulled something out of this. He really did. And, um, I haven't bought the book yet.

**Speaker B:** Sounds awesome.

**Speaker A:** You don't, because, yeah, that's it.

**Speaker B:** Sounds like the Garden of Eden, you know? It's like, it's like everything's here, really. And especially was here 100 years ago, you know? You could drink from any herb. Hundreds of years ago.

**Speaker A:** Indeed. I think he wrote the commentaries to Genesis. Maybe he was in the process. I think it's really— whoa, it's got— it just, it was quite, um, quite creative.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Genesis is amazing. Yeah, it's, it's funny how the Bible has so much, uh, so much patterns with our, our reality, even though sometimes I view it as just like a like an allegory, you know, or a poetic. But life's funny like that, because I guess it's a part of nature, it's a part of the Dharma. So it's no surprise really that a whole bunch of patterns would have so much nice meaning and value in our life.

**Speaker A:** Some not so much, but— What does the Dharma reveal? It reveals the shape of nature itself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, truth of nature. True that. Yeah, everything's fractal, man. Yeah, it's crazy. Well, guys, I better get ready to go get my, uh, my kiddos. Yeah, it's been great talking with you guys. Thanks for showing up, Brad, DJ. You guys are dope.

**Speaker C:** All right, thank you. It was a wonderful talk.

**Speaker B:** You guys are awesome. And hopefully we'll see each other again soon.

**Speaker C:** Yes. All right, peace out.

**Speaker B:** Thanks so much, guys. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Sangha friends Brett (Speaker A) and DJ (Speaker C), is a warm, informal conversation that explores core Buddhist principles through personal experience and mutual support. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **Core Themes & Teachings**

1.  **The Central Practice: Gladdening the Mind in the Present**
    *   The primary focus is on finding satisfaction and joy **here and now**, not chasing future spiritual rewards or dwelling on the past. The breath (*Anapanasati*) is emphasized as the always-available anchor to reality.
    *   **Key Quote:** "If it's not about gladdening the mind right here, right now, right where we sit, then it's of no use."

2.  **Recognizing and Uprooting "Baby Dukkha"**
    *   A major practice is the moment-to-moment recognition of subtle dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) as it arises—called "baby dukkha" or "baby plants." If not "plucked out" early through mindfulness, they grow into overwhelming suffering.
    *   **The Method:** "Remember to look" throughout the day. When a hindrance like doubt, restlessness, or worry arises, acknowledge it ("Hello, doubt"), see it as impersonal and ownerless (*anatta*), and gently return to the breath or a wholesome thought.

3.  **Overcoming Doubt and Superstition**
    *   Doubt (e.g., "I can't do this practice") is identified as a common but conquerable fetter. The solution is not to fight it, but to recognize it and switch to a confident, wholesome mindset ("Oh, fuck yeah, I can do this").
    *   Superstition is seen as anything that pulls you away from the present, including the belief that happiness exists only in a future, magical outcome.

4.  **The Role of Wholesome Living & Friendship (*Sangha*)**
    *   Simple, wholesome activities like walking in nature, exercise, and caring for others are seen as integral to the practice, creating a foundation of well-being that supports meditation.
    *   The **Sangha** (spiritual community) is celebrated as essential. Friends provide accountability, support, and a rare space to discuss the Dhamma deeply. The talk itself embodies this supportive, joyful fellowship.

5.  **Anatta (Not-Self) and the End of Comparison**
    *   The doctrine of *anatta* is presented as a practical tool to end comparison and conceit. If there's no solid self to defend or elevate, the questions of who is better or more advanced simply fall away, leaving only satisfaction.
    *   This is linked to the **neti neti** ("not this, not that") approach of Advaita Vedanta, with the group finding common ground in the pursuit of truth across traditions.

6.  **Engaging with the World Wisely: Care For vs. Care About**
    *   The group discusses how to respond to worldly suffering (e.g., wars, injustice) without being overwhelmed. The distinction is made between unproductive worry ("caring about") and compassionate, skillful action from a place of inner peace ("caring for").
    *   The practice enables one to be a stable, joyful light in the world, which is the most effective form of service.

7.  **Compassion and Understanding Over Hatred**
    *   Drawing from both Buddha and Jesus, the talk emphasizes that hatred cannot cease hatred. People act unskillfully out of ignorance and delusion. The practice is to meet this with compassion and forgiveness—for others and for oneself—understanding that everyone is "lovable" and caught in the aggregates.

### **Notable Personal Insights**
*   **Dhammarato** shares how reviewing his own Dharma video revealed a subtle "chasing mindset" disguised as spiritual talk, reinforcing the need for constant vigilance.
*   **Brett** confesses to moments of doubt ("the superstition that I can't do this") and describes the victory of practicing through it, highlighting the importance of honesty and perseverance.
*   **DJ** discusses using video and even a VTuber avatar as creative ways to share the Dhamma and refine his own understanding.

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**
The talk is less a formal lecture and more a **shared journey of practice among friends**. It emphasizes:
*   **Simplicity:** Returning to the breath and simple joy.
*   **Practicality:** Dealing with everyday hindrances.
*   **Joy:** The profound satisfaction (*sukkha*) found in a gladdened mind.
*   **Support:** The irreplaceable value of a sincere *Sangha*.

The conversation concludes with a sense of gratitude—for the Buddha's teachings, for each other's friendship, and for the direct, liberating path that "delivers the goods" of peace here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversational transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about mindfulness, practice, and the nature of reality. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Key Metaphors**

1. **Baby Dukkhas / Baby Plants**
   - **Speaker B** says: *"the baby plants of the little Dukkhas when they first arrive, if you don't pluck them out right away, they grow to be big oak trees."*
   - **Meaning**: Small dissatisfactions or unwholesome mental states, if not addressed early through mindfulness, can grow into major suffering.

2. **Cloud in the Sky**
   - **Speaker B**: *"if you come back to the breath, that thing, it just changes. Go back to the breath and it fades away like a cloud in the sky."*
   - **Meaning**: Disturbing mental states are transient and can dissipate naturally when we return to mindful awareness.

3. **Moving Target**
   - **Speaker C** references Dhammarato: *"we're a moving target."
   - **Meaning**: The self is not a fixed entity; it’s constantly changing, which aligns with the teaching of *anatta* (not-self).

4. **Rat Race is Bullshit / Dukkha Machine**
   - **Speaker B** describes modern society as a *"Dukkha machine"* and the *"rat race is bullshit."*
   - **Meaning**: The conventional pursuit of material success and external validation is designed to generate suffering, in contrast to the contentment found in Dharma practice.

5. **Fractal Reality**
   - **Speaker B** mentions: *"it's also fractal… the energy in the room changes, the people's attitudes change."*
   - **Meaning**: Patterns of wholesome/unwholesome states repeat at every scale—within the mind, in relationships, and in society.

6. **Kingdom of Heaven Within / Real Magic**
   - **Speaker B** references Jesus: *"the kingdom of heaven is within you"* and calls present-moment awareness *"the real magic."*
   - **Meaning**: True spiritual fulfillment is found internally, in gladdening the mind here and now, not in external pursuits or future rewards.

7. **Pile of Dirt**
   - **Speaker B** recalls Dhammarato: *"we're all kings of our own pile of dirt we're standing on."*
   - **Meaning**: We can find sovereignty and contentment right where we are, with what we have.

---

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1. **Recording and Watching Dharma Videos**
   - **Speaker B** shares a story about making a YouTube video on God and vegetarianism, then watching it back and realizing he was still in a *"chasing mindset"*—seeking future spiritual rewards rather than being present. This became a mirror for self-observation.

2. **Long Walks and ASMR-like Joy**
   - **Speaker C** recalls walks (before formal practice) where after 50 minutes he entered a *"state of joy."* **Speaker B** describes the *"ASMR tingling quality"* and the heightened sensory pleasure (*"crunching of the leaves"*) when in a wholesome, mindful state.

3. **Losing His Voice**
   - **Speaker B** tells of losing his voice for a month and realizing how much speech is meaningless entertainment, and how much world trouble stems from boredom and inability to be content in silence.

4. **Ram Dass and Politicians**
   - **Speaker B** recounts how Ram Dass put pictures of politicians he disliked (like Nixon) on his shrine, practicing compassion and praise to overcome aversion.

5. **Jesus and the Three Wise Men as Tibetan Lamas**
   - **Speaker B** shares an apocryphal story (attributed to the Dalai Lama) that the Three Wise Men were Tibetan Buddhist lamas who took Jesus to be raised as a lama, explaining his "lost years" and suggesting his teachings align with Dharma.

6. **Coast to Coast AM Radio Story**
   - **Speaker A** describes listening to a conspiracy theorist on late-night radio who wove an elaborate tale involving aliens, angels, and quantum mechanics, only to conclude that *"we could easily just get along on this planet."* This illustrates how complex mental proliferation (*papañca*) can obscure simple truths.

7. **The Buddha on His Deathbed**
   - **Speaker B** references the Buddha’s final illness, saying *"Aha, I see you, Mara"* when experiencing physical pain—modeling how to recognize and transform dukkha even in extreme conditions.

---

### **Overall Themes**
The metaphors and stories consistently emphasize:
- **Impermanence and non-self** (*anicca, anatta*)
- **The danger of small, unchecked dissatisfactions**
- **The simplicity of present-moment awareness as the "real magic"**
- **The universality of Dharma across traditions** (Buddhism, Advaita, Christianity)
- **The importance of compassionate, non-judgmental observation** of one’s own mind
- **Society as a generator of dukkha**, and the practice as an antidote

These devices make the abstract principles of Dharma relatable and grounded in everyday experience.
