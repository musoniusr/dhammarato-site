### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So first off, Joe, I would like to congratulate you for actually going there to get the Sutta.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's really nice that it's all available online.

**Speaker A:** So yes, right. Well, I want to talk about a topic, and that is that there is a Western Buddhism that seems much more based upon the translations into English and what people have made of it, in the sense of much of Western Buddhism is scholarship. But there was some foundational errors that were made in that original translation.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That because I have been in Thailand for a long time and been exposed to the Thai translations as well as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, my teacher, was quite into the retranslations and whatnot like that. So the issue of how the Pali is translated has been a big deal for centuries in Thailand. To where it's not even yet an issue in the US because they don't understand how badly the translations have been, because everybody is lazy in the sense that they're using the same lexicon. But in fact, what I think would be a very good idea is to have every script and every translation that we have of the Pali, like in Sinhalese or in the Burmese script or in the Vietnamese script and that, that kind of thing, all the various scripts, uh, as well as then the translation into that local language, and then from that local language, from that local language into English, so that we can have all of these various translations back into the English so that we could compare them. That would take quite a database, and that would be useful and valuable, because all I really have is things that I know of, a little bit from the Sri Lankan, but most of it is obviously English besides the Thai. And what I have found from the Thai is that there are some words in English that have been translated spectacularly backwards and wrong, and things like that. And that basically the question, and we'll get to it in detail in a moment, but Basically, the question is, how should we translate these Pali words like jati and bhava? Because clearly the translations that are translated were done from a very Christianized point of view.

**Speaker B:** And I also just find it confusing whenever authors try to explain those terms too. I mean, I've been reading explanations of those words for a long time from various authors, and it never really— especially Bhavana— like, it never really does anything for me, you know.

**Speaker A:** I'm just lost. But the old, the old tankas that have the, uh, Paticcasamuppada, um, in, in a big circle and whatnot, they always show, uh, the, uh, an image of a pregnant woman, uh, as Bhavana giving people the idea that that's what they're actually talking about, what you see is what you get, rather than what that means is process, like the process of becoming something. All right, like what is the birth of a pianist? What is the process that that pianist goes through? What stage in his piano practice would he or anyone else consider him a pianist? When in fact we all know that the pianist is the one who drinks the most beer. But never mind my old jokes, let's go to the point of what is the process then of the practicing of the piano that makes a pianist become a pianist, rather than just a kid practicing the piano.

**Speaker B:** What makes a person a pianist from being somebody that just plays the piano? Well,

**Speaker A:** the answer is that it's a process. There's no particular point in time, right? Okay, there's no particular point in time. It's a becoming, it's a process, it's not an event.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true. That makes sense.

**Speaker A:** All right, now here's the whole point in this, if we can get to it just right, right quickly. Most of Western thinking is event-oriented. Okay, okay. The pianist is not a pianist until he does a recital. Okay, you've got to graduate from high school and get a diploma, otherwise high school means nothing.

**Speaker B:** Correct, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's the whole idea, is that our— uh, uh, it's all— you could go so far as it's the bottom line oriented stuff. And the West say, oh well, no, we're going to be top line oriented. No, the whole point is you got to read all 4 pages, right? Okay, all right. That it's all process oriented. This is what the word Bhavana is actually meaning, and it's a verb used in the Pali, so you hear many different uses of it. It also has the quality of development in the sense of developing a skill. So in the Thai, there is a place here called Adhipa Boan, which is at Bhavana, and what that means is the development of light. And they're talking about the development of the light within you. Okay, so this is how that word Bhavana is to be used. But before we go much deeper into it, let's back up from the very beginning. So read me the first line or two, the first sentence of the part that you started reading to me before.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's, uh, being so full of favoring and opposing when they experience any kind of feeling pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.

**Speaker A:** Okay, stop. Okay. All right. So what that means is, is that we're being disposed of feelings. Basically what that means is, is that at this particular point in the talk, the Buddha is stepping in right in the, in the dab smack middle of Paticcasamuppada. And that the, the basic part of that is, is that, uh, before that process happens, something impacts us strong enough to raise a feeling. If it doesn't impact us, pañña, if that contact doesn't happen, then no feeling much arises. That means then that when the English is translating that third kind of feeling as a neutral feeling, that means that the translators don't know what they're talking about because the actual Pali doesn't say that at all. What the Pali says, if you go into it, is either Dukkha, Sukkha, Vedana, or Adhukkha, Asukkha, Vedana. Those things do not cancel each other out. Please do not take Buddha's formulas and rearrange them like you do in an algebraic equation.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's Dukkha, Asukkha, and Vedana. But Vedana, isn't that feeling?

**Speaker A:** I mean, well, that's the whole point. That's what you just read. That's where I stopped you exactly at the word feeling. I said stop now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that seems really confusing because— yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, no, it's not. We have in English language two different uses for the word feeling, right? Yeah, we have the word sense contact and we also have the word for emotion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, in the Pali they would have either it differently too, or you could say 3, they add a third. And that third one is the one, the Vedana, that the Buddha is talking about, and that is a deep sense of leaning or directing the mind into being either liking it or not liking it, or confused about whether we like it or not. So it's either Sukkha or Dukkha Vedana, or it is Asukkha Aduka or Sukkha-Dukkha. But both the Asuka-Aduka or the Sukkha-Dukkha means that it's someplace in between. It's a mix.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that third feeling is what we in English would call confusion, that we're not sure, we get confused.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And for instance, the child will get confused because he doesn't know the answer to the question, but really he doesn't know how to feel, because if he knew the answer to the question, he would know how to feel. But he doesn't want to say, no, I feel bad, so we'd choose to feel confused. But confusion often rots into I don't like it, especially in the sense of the unknown, for, uh, like, um, other people, that because we don't know them as other, we put them in the not good category. Or perhaps a better way of saying it is they put it in the possibly dangerous category. Okay. So we actually are looking for the resolution of that feeling into I either like it or I don't like it. That's much more comfortable than the fear state of I don't know what it is.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And I imagine without having to question you, but I go ahead and ask you the question. You know what it feels like to feel confused?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, great. So you know what he's talking about, except that you probably remember confused when it was really, really big, to where in fact we get confused often on a tiny little level, depending upon the impact. If it impacts you big, then you can have a big confusion. But sometimes things impact us just a tiny, tiny little bit, just to give us kind of a nudge in one direction or another. All right, you've also known that there have been times when you really like something. Could have been a visual image, or it could have been a touch, or it could have been just a feeling of well-being on the inside, but you liked it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's Vedana. That's Sukkha Vedana. You liked it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then there is the Dukkha Vedana. You don't like it. You've experienced not liking a sensation on the skin, like a mosquito bite or a cut or burn, and we don't like it. Okay, the sensation on the skin is just a sensation on the skin. It's the liking or not liking is why we call it pain. The word pain has the quality of not liking it built into it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So now we have three kinds of feelings. We have Sukkha, Dukkha, and Arahant. All right. Now, those three kinds of Vedana, let's take one as an example of a like it. 'If I like it, I want it' is the first ignorance down the rat hole. 'If I like it, I want it.' What happens with the guy when he sees the beautiful girl? He wants her. In other words, they say that she's painting herself up to be attractive because she wants to attract him. So there's a difference between enjoying the beauty of it and wanting it. Okay, all right. There's only two kinds of people who will go into the Metropolitan Museum in New York, pay several dollars to go and look at a particular painting, and look at that painting wanting it. There's two kinds of people: one, moneybags, and number two, thieves. Well, guess what? The moneybag was a thief. There's just a different kind of thief than the kind that I'm talking about. They'll steal it to get money. He steals it because he's got money, or he'll buy it because he's that money. Everybody else can just appreciate it as it is. It's just beautiful. But these guys, now they want it, right? Okay, that is what we call Tanha in the Pali— wanting, craving, grasping, but not yet clinging. The clinging is the next stage of it. And the next stage of it is the clinging that instantaneously the object to be clung to now requires something else. It requires something to do the clinging, and the process of coming from Tanha into clinging is the Bhavana, and that which clings to it is the self, the Jati, the birth. The round and around and around she goes. And we do that, and that's the Dukkha, okay? Until we wake up to that and say, aha, I see you. And now we can escape from that. And that can happen in the mind, okay? Now there's an intermediate step in there, and then this is where the woeful states come in. From that grasping and clinging We are reborn in one of the woeful states. They are known as the Four Woeful States. Do you know them?

**Speaker B:** Um, I'm not sure. I'm not familiar with the term the Four Woeful States.

**Speaker A:** The Four Woeful States— one of them is Hell, the other one is preta, the Hungry Ghost, Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The third one is a dumb draft animal, and the fourth one is the Titans or the Asuras who are afraid to go into battle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, these are the woeful states that clinging and the development into the birth— that is what we're reborn. We're reborn into hell. Okay, when we get angry We're in hell.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When we are anxious and uptight and we can't stand the situation, or when we're in great despair, that's a kind of a hell.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That when we want something really bad— in fact, that whole first example about the guy wants the girl, or the guy wants the piece of art— now he's been reborn as a hungry ghost. He can't get his— can't get no satisfaction. All right, I want it, I want it, I want it. Um, common words for that would be lovesick or unrequited love, when you can't get what you want. All right, another name for it is Wall Street or the stock market, because they can't— nobody get what they want on Wall Street. But they think they can't. Actually, there they go from A to B again, looking for something in the wrong places. They think that what they want is happiness and peace of mind and joy, and so then they think mistakenly that money will get them that for them. All right, and so now we want money. Because we think that if we get money, we'll have joy and satisfaction and peace of mind. Except that when you get a couple of million dollars, now you're afraid to lose it on Wall Street. And now, so you've got two problems. One is my own safety and security, and two is the safety and security of my wad of dough. And so it's a bit dangerous to go that direction. Yeah. The same thing is true of the guy who gets the trophy wife. If he thinks she's a trophy, then others will have a trophy idea and they want her too, you see. So that kind of thing is dangerous. And when we can see that, that clinging and that greed of want and want, that's the hungry ghost. And you've experienced that from time to time. You've experienced all of these things as we talk about them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The third one on the list is remarkable in the sense that this is the one that's the most common, and yet in Buddhism it's the one that's least understood. Okay. That is the hungry— not the hungry ghost, it is the animal, the animal world. Okay. What the Buddha was referring to was draft animals. The donkey that is having to pull in a circle a great big log that has a millstone on it, right? So that the farmer standing aside of the road puts his sugarcane in there and out comes sugarcane juice, and he sells that for 10 rupees. But the donkey don't get no sugarcane juice. No, you don't get none. He just has to turn that thing around. Well, we live our lives like that. In the sense that we started about the first grade when we're put to work. We're told to sit down and learn your ABCs, your 1-2-3s, and the kid says, "Why?" And the mom says, "Well, if you pass the first grade, you could get into the second grade."

**Speaker B:** "Why?"

**Speaker A:** "Well, if you get into second grade, you can get into third grade, and you get out of primary school into middle school." "Why?" Okay, where's the end of all of that? So if you get a— if you get your degrees out of university, then you can get a job. Why? What's the point? The point is, is the way that our society is set up is that we never get the benefit. We never feel comfortable and happy and relaxed and satisfied. It's always more work to do and more work to do, and the rewards are pitiful.

**Speaker B:** Until you become too old to do anything, and then you're kind of like still waiting for that reward, and then you're too old and seen as not really worth anything, disposable at that point.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, it depends upon how soon, and some people never do have a midlife crisis. Some of us have it in the 20s. But yeah, that's the whole point, is the midlife crisis is when someone finally wakes up to the fact that he's been robbed, he's been lied to, he has been put to work like a draft animal for the past X number of years, and he didn't get nothing out of it. Yeah, because we're always continuously being dissatisfied. That's what our culture wants us to do. The culture wants us if there is a culture that wants things. I mean, the way that it's systemically set up is for people to be continuously dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** Well, and it also makes you sort of identify with this image. I know for myself that a lot of times I've thought, well, I've done this and this and this, and this is what gives me worth as a person, not realizing that like it's very temporary and it can all be taken away at any moment. And it's not really what you are at all, those things that you've done that have built up a resume. And, you know, but you spend so much time building, building, building something that's totally imaginary.

**Speaker A:** Right. And all you've really been doing is just following orders, do what you were told to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** By people who heard it someplace else, and they are doing out there what they were told to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the people they heard it from heard it from someplace else, and it's just been folklore or passed down that you're— that if you don't work, you don't eat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's not true at all. In fact, uh, the past several months, the people in the U.S. have been quitting their jobs by the millions. Because they're beginning to figure out that that's not true. They— you don't have to work for a living. Yeah, living is wonderful when you don't have to work. In fact, let's stop work altogether and just start playing with our lives, which is what the Buddha is really talking about here. But what we get done— what happens is we get stuck into these, um, local states, especially this draft animal of going along to get along. And believing the lies that we've been told like dumb animals do.

**Speaker B:** Can you just hold on a second? I think there's a package really quick. Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, there's me being a donkey and having to do my societal role of answering the door.

**Speaker A:** I was wondering if you would figure that out. Yeah, were you the hungry ghost or were you the dumb animal?

**Speaker B:** I think I was the animal.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you're already getting some benefit out of this conversation. So moving right along, the fourth one then is what is called the Asuras, which has a direct correlation with the Titans in the Greek language. And these are the lesser gods that are the warriors who are all dressed up for battle with no place to go, or they're afraid to go. This is basically the state of fear that we get ourselves into based upon territory and things like this. Now, it's quite interesting. These— let me give you a couple examples of it. The child who walks out on stage that has one line to say in the play and that is, "I am a tree," and there he is dressed up as a tree, and he walks out on stage, and he has stage fright, and he forgets his line. All right, that whole idea of stage fright, or being afraid of an audience, or being afraid of being caught, or things like that, and we freeze, or we go into fear, needlessly on all kinds of occasions, because we're dressed for battle. So we think that there's a battle, and so we're trying to avoid the battles out there, and so we wind up being afraid a lot. OK, now there's something very interesting about this, and that is that we have identified with Western science, we have understood about the four primary instincts. The self-preservation instinct is the bottom line, and that's the one associated with fear. And then we have the procreation instinct, which has to do with materialism, which is corresponding to the Hungry Ghost. And then we have the nesting or the herding instinct, which goes along with being an animal, of going along to get along, do what you're told to do because you're in this nest. If you leave the nest, it's going to be dangerous out there. And after you are a Titan or an Asura, and you're afraid to go out on your own, so you got to stay in the nest. But if you do, you got to do what you're told to do. So you can see how these instincts work together. And then the last one is the territorial instinct of what is our territory, in the sense of things outside of our territory are unknown, foreign, not us. And this gives rise to One thing is tribalism and racism, and then on another level, it gives us identity in the sense of, I am this, not that. I'm a Democrat, not a Republican, or I'm a Jew, not a Gentile, or I am a Roman soldier, not a Greek soldier, or I am a Catholic, not a Protestant, or I'm a Canadian, not a Mexican. That separation all have to do a lot with territory. But it's also that territorial instinct has to do then with these four woeful states, and that there's almost a direct correlation to the point that our identity and what the Buddha is talking about in the sense of attachment to views is very much the territorial instinct, and also the animal state, the wolf state of being an animal, or going along to getting along, or what he also refers to as Sila Bhanta Paramasa, of all the laws, rules, regulations that we store in here about how to get along. So this is very instinctual. It's very interesting to note that really, A very easy way to understand the Buddhist teaching is that if we live our lives intellectually investigating and acting wisely, then that means that we are not following our instincts, we're not following our heart anymore, we're not living by intuition, we're living by wisdom. Because it's our instincts that are on automatic pilot that almost always wind us up in the gutter. Okay, that it's almost like a Tesla, and our AI driving system hasn't been quite worked out for the streets that we're on now. That it worked fine when we were on dirt roads way back when, but our mapping system is not good for modern highways. We need to actually watch what we're doing and watch where we're going to live a modern life happily, is by doing it wisely. Which— and the question then, or where is the right place to put our wisdom is at that point of contact so that we wisely have control over the way that we feel. Because if we, uh, if we can wisely control the way that we feel, then we can say, fine, I like it, but I don't want it, right? Fine, I don't like it, but I'm not going to try to fix it. Just because that cat's injured out there in the wild and I can't trap it in my trap doesn't mean that I've got to go feel bad about that cat. I could say, that cat, I mean, I don't like that that cat's out there, but I can't do anything about it, right? Right. So we can accept that. I, I don't like it, but I'm not going to do anything about it. Or the third one is, is that, oh, I'm confused, let me do more investigation.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Rather than assume something. But normally we assume that I don't like it. That's why we have tribalism, is because I don't know who that guy is, therefore he may be dangerous, and therefore he's the wrong color. And you know how that trip goes, that's a big rattle. So, um, the way that we're talking about this phrase, starting from that word feeling, that's the word Vedana. From Vedana it goes to Tanha. From Tanha it goes to Upadana. From Upadana it goes to Bhavana. From Bhavana to Jati, and from Jati to Dukkha. All right, so the first thing that happens is pañña. From pañña it goes to Vedana. I like it. The Vedana, okay, so I like it. Oh, I like it, and now I got to go get it. This is the Tanha, wanting it, and then the grasping it is the Upadana. But in order to do the grasping, while that's happening, we have the Bhava of the self attaching to the object, and that's the self. And now that that has happened, around and around the Samsara wheel of Dukkha goes. Okay, this is the process that the Buddha is talking about there, but he's doing it in the language that's, number one, a foreign language to us anyway. And even with the concepts are very ancient, you couple that with bad translations and it makes it very confusing. But the way that I've described it to you is easy peasy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. It's so— I mean, I've always been confused with like dependent origination and I think that, yeah, it makes it a lot more clear than any other explanation that I've ever received. So I appreciate that.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's right there in the suttas, but also this is according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that in fact I have snuck some of his particular teachings in there, like wisdom at the point of contact. Yeah, that's how we cure this thing.

**Speaker B:** I think that's really important because I know a lot of times I've been told, "Oh, follow your heart," or "Follow your instincts." That's sort of a common phrase, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right, right into the side of the mountain. Sure, just go right ahead. Don't watch where you're going. Follow your heart. Well, the whole idea is that if you don't follow your heart, you'll be miserable. Because that means that you've got two choices: either to follow your heart or do what you're told to do. If you go by doing what you're told to do instead of what you want to do, you see, so that's the dichotomy. But both of them are wrong, right? The right way to do it is to look at what you're doing, to recognize where this stuff comes from, and to recognize what that stuff comes from and say, never mind, I don't need either one of them. I don't have to follow my heart, and I don't have to do what I'm told to do. I can do things wisely, a third way.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** so that's the way that we have to recognize it, that we have both of those issues that we have to work with. Because guess what? Both of them are instinctual. Both of them have to do with the way that we manage our feelings But always the feelings are in service of the self-preservation instinct, the selfishness that's within. Because this is the feeling that's associated with that, is that feeling of fear. But that's the bottom line feeling. Why? Because that's the feeling that keeps us alive, it keeps us surviving. Which means that when we feel fear, that separates us from that which we find dangerous. That's the duality, is based in fear. When there is no fear, then we can have unity. But when there is fear, that's where the separation comes from. And the separation comes within us because of the self-preservation instinct. It's an instinct built into it, okay? And as long as we let that instinct operate on its own it will have a whole lot of false positives, so that fear will come up when in fact there's no reason to have fear at all. There's also the connection between the mind and the feelings, in the sense that we can— many, many examples. When you get somebody really angry, he can't think straight. When you got somebody who really, really wants something very badly, they can't think about anything else but that. Right, so the way that we feel controls the kind of thinking that we have, but also the thinking that we have controls our feelings. These things are interrelated and kind of in a circular feedback loop. So if you have a thought that gives anxiety, or someone has a thought that gives anxiety, and then they see the anxiety and they don't like the anxiety, then have thoughts of trying to get rid of the anxiety, which creates more anxiety, and it becomes a loop. Okay, I'm really uptight and I don't want to be uptight, and that keeps me uptight because I don't want to be uptight, right? The easy thing to do is just to forget about it and relax. And it's the forgetting about it that's the important thing, is let's change the subject. Let's get the mind off of, uh, whatever we have as feelings and think about something else. That we really can control the way that we feel if we put the right process involved to give us the right kind of contact.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So when the mind is thinking thoughts, those thoughts contact or set off the pineal and the pituitary glands that are connected directly to the adrenaline gland, and all that stuff goes right into the bloodstream. Right? So knowing that, we can begin to figure out that, oh, the way that I feel now is kind of the sum total of the way that I have been feeling my whole life, and I felt the way that I did because I talked myself into it. That we literally talk ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives. Now it's time to start talking ourselves into feeling good. Let's start having some wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Let's start having some thoughts that are going to impact our feeling system such that we're going to start feeling really good. So we have to start to have thoughts of safety, thoughts of security, and then we'll feel safe and secure instead of freaked out and afraid and anxious and uptight, so that we can actually create our own environment of happy thoughts so that we can bring on a state of happiness. We can feel comfortable because we have comfortable thoughts. Oh, this is such a nice chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair, you really do a good job here. I really appreciate you. Yeah, make things really comfortable. Okay, so these are the kind of thoughts that we would have. Gratitude, thoughts of generosity, thoughts of well-being. And with that, we also then begin to develop thoughts and feelings of satisfaction, like everything's okay, everything is fine, everything is all right. Okay, now when we're actually doing that, we are interrupting that whole process so that the Paticcasamuppada is not fulfilled. That we cut it off, we break it. And at this point in time, what we're talking about is we're breaking it there at that feeling level, because we can control the way that we feel. We can talk ourselves into feeling that way. In fact, we're doing it wisely. We're having wise feelings. And so at this point in time, we're actually breaking that cycle, and we're breaking it at this point. Now, with higher development, we can break it even earlier. But at least we've cut the whole snake in half by being able to practice Anapanasati, by gladdening the mind and changing the thoughts that we have. So this is that in fact, the first part of the sutra is what I'm talking about now, in the sense that starting with the whole concept that fire must have a fuel to burn, right? Okay, what fire do you know of that does that, burns without any fuel at all? This was the question that the Buddha was asking everybody, and everybody agreed that they don't know of a fire. Well, that answers a whole bunch of questions, because in fact what we're talking about here is we're talking about the general understanding of engineering, or the general understanding of energy, or the general understanding of what's possible and to possible. It's not possible for a fire to happen without a fuel, okay? And it's also then not possible for consciousness to happen without a fuel. And the fuel for consciousness is just like the fuel for fire. The fire is known by its fuel. Consciousness is also known by its fuel, in the sense of the eye consciousness, the hearing consciousness, the touch, taste, This is sense consciousness. But there is another kind of consciousness, and that is what we would call this stuff after it's being processed. How is it processed? It's processed with nama-rupa, which then gives rise to the sallyatana. And it's the sallyatana that is in fact the other kind of consciousness. The way that we do this in English is that I see the tree Or I say, I see what you mean. When I say, I see what you mean, that's Salyatana. When I say, I see a tree, we're talking about this kind of consciousness with the eye.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So when I say, I see what you mean, that means that I have brought a bunch of past stuff into it. If I bring it in ignorantly, then I will bring in old bad feelings coming from instincts. But if I bring it in wisely, then the kind of thoughts that I can have will be different than the kind of thoughts that I would have if I were doing it ignorantly. So I see something out there, wisely I can decide what I'm going to do with it rather than just automatically doing it ignorantly. So in fact, ignorance is at every level of the occasion here, and That's why it's also the foundation, the foundation of everything. And what we do is we begin to dispel that ignorance. And one of the first ways of doing it is dispelling it in the sense of becoming familiar with the way that you feel so that you can feel first and then wisely decide to act rather than automatically acting upon the feelings. Like if I like something, I ignorantly want it. But if I wisely see that feeling, then I can stop it. I don't have to want it. But if I want it and want it and want it, I've got to stop it and stop it and stop it. If I can back that process up to the point that I don't want it anymore, then I don't have to say, I want it, I want it, I want it. And every time I have to slap it, no, you don't, no, you don't, you can't get it, you don't have it. And so there's even more peace of mind But the important thing there is, is that normally in this process along the line, someone stops because we wake up. An argument, for instance, will go along just so long until either a third party or one of the people will break it up. If they don't break it up, somebody is going to get hurt. And if we don't break it up, then somebody is going to die. An argument always is a violent act. It only depends upon how sharp is our dagger. Is our dagger words, or are their daggers real? Okay, but other than that, how far into the argument do we go? If we don't argue much, in other words, as the argument starts, we say, 'I don't care about it,' then our life is easy again immediately, rather than going into an argument and getting deeper into it and deeper into it and digging it deeper into Paticcasamuppada until there could be really severe Dukkha. So this is how things cycle and cycle and cycle to go downhill with it. But always the process is with the Paticcasamuppada. This leads to that, and things circle and go down this way. So that's what that teaching there is about. And all of the Westerners get hung up on what do those words mean. Like Bhava and Jati, where really what they're talking about is the process of once we want that and we start clinging to it, that drive is the beginning of the self, and the self attaching to it is now the full-blown me. It is me now that is angrier, it's me now that is involved with that. And when that self is in it, that's where the Dukkha arises. You could go so far as to say that the self's only use and only existence is a bucket to carry Dukkha. That's what the self is for. And you can see that instinctually of how the self operates. In the sense of the self-preservative instinct, gives us fear, which means now we must take some action. Fear is the rally cry within one's mind-body complex: you got to do something. That's why the child feels afraid and then does something. Until mommy can make the kid afraid, he's not going to do anything. So if mom really is insistent on the kid doing something, she's got to make him afraid. The carrot wasn't enough, out comes the stick. So when we're recognizing that that is a natural motivator, that means that when you become unafraid of things, you don't have much motivation anymore, because most of the things that motivate us, we're motivated out of fear. So don't be afraid, and then you don't have anything to do, and you can just sit here and say, oh, no place to go and nothing to do, just relax, and everything is cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I've experienced this a little bit. And one thing that happens is my mind kicks in and gets a little bit concerned because it's like you don't enjoy the things you used to enjoy, or you don't— yeah, like just as I practiced, I tend to get into this thing of thinking, how am I going to function in society when I've just completely lost motivation because I see that it doesn't really lead anywhere, and

**Speaker A:** it's not— the answer to that is brilliantly, okay? And not only brilliantly, but flawlessly. And not just flawlessly, but because it's flawless because you don't actually ever do anything, that everything becomes a toy, a joy. You do what you want to do, not because it has to be done. Don't do anything important ever again. Stop with importance. Things are not important. You've been lied to. Here's an easy, clear example, and it happens. I've seen it actually happen in Thailand. This is an actual event. The little girl had been playing with Barbie dolls, but they were the ripoff fake kind. You get in Asia very easy. And she's really into these Barbie dolls, and she takes the dresses off and she pulls the heads off and changes and all kinds of things, and arms and legs and everything go here and there. And her aunt knows how much she enjoys these Barbie dolls, and so she buys her one of the very spiff ones, one of the expensive, real, not a knockoff, a real Barbie doll, cost her $60. And the aunt brings it to give to the little girl, and she's overjoyed. The first thing she does is starts pulling the arms and the legs off of it, but she knows how to play with the doll. The aunt freaks out. What are you doing? That doll costs $60! See, the aunt thought it was important. The child thought it was a toy. Which was it? Was it a $60 important doll, or was it a child's toy? The answer is, which mind are you talking about? To one, it was one. To the other, it was— now, which would you rather have? Would you rather have a child's toy to play with or do you want an expensive Barbie doll?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'd rather have the child's toy.

**Speaker A:** Now you're getting where the Dhamma is. This is— we get out of that whole mentality, the Western mentality. Oh, I want a really expensive, real boy, top-notch quality Barbie doll. It's not supposed to be played with. You can't take that apart, it's too important. So that should be your job now. Your job's not important anymore. Now you can play with it. It's just a toy. But to get that mentality that is, uh, that it's a toy, you have to sit down with your— in practice. This is what Anapanasati practice is all about, is to learn that all of these features and tools that you have— the human body is a marvelous toy to play with. And here we thought that it was a job to do, a machine, a tool, when nothing— no, the human body is just a toy. You've got one person

**Speaker B:** in it.

**Speaker A:** So the first thing to do is to play with it, check it out, pull the head off.

**Speaker B:** You know, this gets into one thing that you mentioned last time as well, that you had said that the when you're noticing the breath, that the throat area is often connected to this fear instinct. And I tended to notice when I've been noticing it that I do have a tightness quite often in my throat area, that like it's something I didn't really notice until you pointed out that, you know, to try to pay attention to it. And I was like, man, there's a lot of the percentage of the day that I have a like this in my throat. Um, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's a question for you. Uh, you know that male lions have manes, big hair jobs. What's the purpose of the mane? Is it in fact a survival mechanism?

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, what did you say?

**Speaker A:** Is it in fact a survival mechanism?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't think so. It's to impress the women, right? Isn't that the thing of it? Or I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say this. When a lion attacks a standing four-legged big creature like a gazelle or a wildebeest or whatever, He jumps on the back, but what's the actual takedown? What's the kill? What's the kill?

**Speaker B:** Uh, I mean, he's biting into it,

**Speaker A:** to the jugular, right into the throat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so if two male lions are fighting over who's going to be the head of the pride, the one who's got the thickest hair is going to be well protected against the other guy. So maybe it's not who bites the hardest, it's who's got the most hair.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, so there you go. Now you're talking about why does the throat tense up? Why do we have all of this protective mechanism? And in fact, the other question to ask is, what's the weakest part of the body?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's definitely there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. This is why we tense up in our throats. It's good awareness for you. You're not alone with that, but you're lucky that you figured it out. Okay, so start watching for that. Yes, become aware of what the body is doing. That's excellent. This is what the Anapanasati is all about. This is most specifically stage 3 of Anapanasati, is getting to know this body. Yeah, that's why I call it a toy. It's a toy to play with. Get to learn it, notice it, play with it, check it out. And we do that with the mind in the sense that this is why we work with Sati, to have the long, deep in-breath, is because that starts to train us in paying attention to the body, to be here now rather than lost in space or last year or over yonder or with them, that kind of stuff. But no, we're here now, paying attention to the breathing, paying attention to the neck, and paying attention to what the body is doing, and paying attention to the fact that, hey man, we're so relaxed. Everything is just easy peasy, just sitting and no place to go, because I'm not afraid. And if I'm not afraid, I got no motivation. So this is the whole style that we can change to, in the sense that we deal with society the way that we were taught to deal with society, which basically means that we have a whole lot of instructions that we tell ourselves, and then we feel bad about them. We either be afraid and we go do it, or we feel guilty because we don't want to do it, and, or we feel rebellious or whatever like that, when it's just a bunch of collection of mental rules that we've made up or we've heard someplace else. Mostly they've made— they've— I mean, there have been so many rules for so long, it's hard to find someone making up a new rule. They generally— they've already been made up and passed down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so getting out of that system of automatic pilot in the sense of operating by instincts or operating by a set of rules. And those are the two ways that we normally do it, as opposed to the third way is operating wisely, waking up, paying attention, notice what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** and that's what that teaching about Paticcasamuppada is all about. So the next time we talk, we can talk about earlier parts of Paticcasamuppada. But when you're reading that sutta, make sure that you understand that the Buddha is talking about the way that the mind works in a way that we can understand it, even though it's in really, really religious language because that's who translated it, right? Right. And so, um, there's one thing that I can tell you, and that is on Sutta Central, if you go to Sukkha's translations, you can mix the Pali with the, uh, and, and with that you can actually then start looking at these words and, and looking to kind of start recognizing Yeah, I played with

**Speaker B:** that a little bit, and it's quite interesting doing it because sometimes the, you know, it takes quite a lot of like English words to translate something that is like one phrase in Pali, and then the phrase has like, it has a prefix or a suffix that is just replaced by something else for the next one. And it's really interesting because it gives you a totally different feeling when it's just like this, and when you realize that, oh, this one is related to the previous one this way because it has the same suffix.

**Speaker A:** And it's quite excellent. Yes, in fact, you can see that in a way much of the suttas are poetry. Yeah, with symmetry and repetition over and over and over again. But the English translators, to make the book shorter, will lift out stuff that's repeated over and over again. In fact, If you look at the Pali, in that particular sutta on that website, they do have all the Pali, but he doesn't bother translating but about half of it.

**Speaker B:** Right. He puts dot, dot, dot.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, it's the Pali. I mean, yeah, I can see the English only, but if you look at the Pali, it means it's got its translation, Pali translation, Pali translation, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, Pali, translation, okay. And so he's left out a whole section of the translation in English, and that's all the Pali that's in there, okay, which means that if you're not looking at the Pali, you miss out on the fact that things are repeated in a certain way that makes it slightly a little differently on this and that aspect, or just the repetition of it has the quality of just grinding this stuff in. But that's the part that reading the books is missing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, that makes sense. It's kind of like talking to you and then you repeating the same thing over and over and over again, and each time you hear it, you're like, oh yeah, that's right, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, that's it.

**Speaker A:** That's what it is. The Buddha, Dharma is very small. There's not much to it. But it's only valuable when you keep doing it over and over and over again. And very much so that I like this practice, just like Anapanasati, in the sense that it's like breathing. The Dharma is as easy as breathing, but you got to keep doing it. You can't just stop breathing because it became easy. So I've had enough breath, I'm just going to quit now. No, it needs to be repeated over and over and over and over and over again. Why? Because you spent all these years having thoughts of unwholesome. Now it's time to balance that out and to start having one wholesome thought after another after another.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so it's very repetitive. The sutras are repetitive. I'm repetitive. It all is just going— I mean, your whole life is repetitive. If you stand back from it, you'll recognize that. Now you're just spinning in a different kind of circle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Joe, well, let's finish up now. This has been a delightful little conversation, and continue on with your practice and go get another sutta. Really test me, see what we can do here.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Have a nice day. Okay. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on clarifying core Buddhist concepts often misunderstood in Western translations. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Correcting Foundational Translation Errors**
Dhammarato argues that Western Buddhism relies on English translations of the Pali Canon that contain significant errors, stemming from a Christianized worldview. He advocates for a comparative approach, using translations from various Asian languages (Thai, Sinhalese, Burmese, etc.) to better understand the original meaning.

### **Key Conceptual Clarifications**

1.  **Bhava (Becoming):** It is not an *event* (like a physical birth) but a *process* of development or "becoming" something (e.g., the process of becoming a pianist). Western thinking is event-oriented, while the Buddha's teaching is process-oriented.

2.  **Vedana (Feeling):** This is critically redefined. It is not simply pleasant, unpleasant, and *neutral* feelings. The Pali terms are:
    *   **Sukkha Vedana:** Feeling of liking/leaning-toward.
    *   **Dukkha Vedana:** Feeling of disliking/leaning-away.
    *   **Adukkhamasukha Vedana:** A mixed or confused feeling ("I don't know if I like it or not"), often manifesting as uncertainty or fear of the unknown.

3.  **The Process of Suffering (Paticcasamuppāda - Dependent Origination):**
    The talk walks through a key chain of causation:
    *   **Contact** leads to **Vedana** (feeling of like/dislike/confusion).
    *   **Vedana** leads to **Taṇhā** (craving, wanting).
    *   **Taṇhā** leads to **Upādāna** (grasping/clinging).
    *   The process of clinging (**Bhava**) creates the **Jāti** (birth) of the "self" identified with the object.
    *   This birth of the self is what leads to **Dukkha** (suffering, stress).

4.  **The Four Woeful States (Mental Realms):**
    Clinging (**Upādāna**) leads to rebirth in one of four "woeful states," which are **mental states** we experience in life:
    *   **Hell:** States of anger, hatred, and despair.
    *   **Hungry Ghost (Preta):** States of intense, unfulfillable craving and dissatisfaction (e.g., greed, unrequited love).
    *   **Animal (Draft Animal):** The state of dumbly following orders, societal conditioning, and "going along to get along" without questioning—living like a beast of burden.
    *   **Titans/Asuras:** The state of fear, paranoia, and being "dressed for battle" with no place to go (e.g., stage fright, territorial anxiety).

### **Practical Application: The Path to Freedom**

*   **Break the Chain with Wisdom:** The escape from this cycle is to apply wisdom (**paññā**) at the point of **Vedana**. Recognize the feeling (like, dislike, confusion) and wisely choose not to let it escalate into craving.
*   **Don't Follow Instincts or Rules:** The two common, flawed modes of operation are following instinctual cravings ("follow your heart") or blindly following societal rules ("do what you're told"). The "third way" is to act wisely, with investigation and awareness.
*   **Cultivate Wholesome States:** Actively use the mind to generate thoughts of safety, gratitude, generosity, and well-being. This creates positive feelings and breaks the feedback loop of suffering.
*   **See Life as Play, Not Work:** Shift from seeing the body and life as a machine for important work to seeing it as a "toy" to be explored with joy and curiosity. This is part of Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing) practice—getting to know the body and mind without fear or heaviness.
*   **The Role of Fear:** The self-preservation instinct (fear) is the root of duality and motivation in the worldly sense. By practicing to become unafraid, motivation based on fear dissolves, leading to peace and the ability to act from a place of freedom.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that the Dhamma is simple but requires repetitive practice to counteract lifelong habits of unwholesome thinking. By correcting key translations and understanding dependent origination as a real-time psychological process, practitioners can learn to intercept the birth of the suffering self and live more wisely and freely.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain complex Buddhist concepts, particularly around dependent origination (*Paticcasamuppada*), translation errors, and the nature of suffering. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**

1.  **The Pianist (Process vs. Event):**
    *   **What it explains:** The Pali term *Bhava* (becoming).
    *   **The Metaphor:** Becoming a pianist isn't a single event (like a recital); it's a long process of practice and development. This illustrates that *Bhava* is a **process of "becoming"** (e.g., becoming angry, becoming a greedy person) rather than a fixed state or a one-time birth event.

2.  **The Museum-Goer & The Painting (Craving vs. Appreciation):**
    *   **What it explains:** The difference between pleasant feeling (*Vedana*) and craving (*Tanha*).
    *   **The Metaphor:** Most people in a museum can appreciate a painting's beauty (pleasant feeling). Only two types "want" it: thieves and wealthy collectors. This shows that **liking something does not automatically mean craving or grasping it**. Craving (*Tanha*) is the move from "I like this" to "I must have/possess this."

3.  **The Tesla on Autopilot (Instincts vs. Wisdom):**
    *   **What it explains:** Living by instinctual habits vs. mindful wisdom.
    *   **The Metaphor:** Our ingrained instincts (like fear, territoriality) are like an AI self-driving system programmed for "dirt roads" (primitive survival). They are ill-suited for the complex "modern highways" of life and often lead us astray. **Wisdom** is like taking manual control—paying attention and navigating wisely.

4.  **The Self as a Bucket for Suffering:**
    *   **What it explains:** The role of the sense of self (*Jati*).
    *   **The Metaphor:** The ego or sense of "me" that arises during clinging is described as a **"bucket to carry *Dukkha* (suffering/stress)."** Its primary function is to hold and experience the suffering created by the process of craving and identification.

5.  **Fire and Fuel (Consciousness requires an object):**
    *   **What it explains:** The nature of consciousness (*Viññāṇa*).
    *   **The Metaphor:** Just as fire cannot exist without fuel, **consciousness cannot exist without an object** (sight, sound, thought, etc.). Consciousness is defined by what it is conscious *of* (eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, etc.).

6.  **The Body as a Toy:**
    *   **What it explains:** The attitude for meditation and life.
    *   **The Metaphor:** We typically see the body as a tool for work or a burden. Instead, we should see it as a **marvelous toy to explore and play with** through mindful awareness (like in *Ānāpānasati*). This shifts practice from a chore to curious, joyful investigation.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Barbie Doll (Importance vs. Play):**
    *   **Story:** A girl joyfully disassembles a new, expensive Barbie doll, just as she did with cheap knock-offs. The aunt is horrified because she sees a **valuable object**. The child sees a **toy**.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how we project "importance" and seriousness onto life, creating suffering. The Dharma teaches us to recover a playful, non-attached relationship to experiences—to see life as a toy, not a high-stakes task.

2.  **The Donkey at the Mill (The Woeful State of the Animal):**
    *   **Story:** A donkey walks in circles all day turning a millstone to crush sugarcane. The farmer gets the profitable juice; the donkey gets nothing.
    *   **Purpose:** To describe one of the "Four Woeful States" (*apāya*)—the state of a **draft animal**. This symbolizes a life of mindless, repetitive labor without true satisfaction, following societal scripts ("go to school, get a job") without questioning the purpose.

3.  **The Child with Stage Fright (The Woeful State of the Asura/Titan):**
    *   **Story:** A child dressed as a tree freezes with stage fright, forgetting their one line: "I am a tree."
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the woeful state of the *Asura* (Titan/demigod)—a state of **paralyzing fear and anxiety**, "dressed for battle" but afraid to act. It relates to the territorial and self-preservation instincts.

4.  **The Man with the Trophy Wife (The Hungry Ghost Cycle):**
    *   **Story:** A man who sees a woman as a "trophy" to possess becomes a "hungry ghost" (*preta*)—constantly wanting, and then constantly anxious about losing his possession to others who also see her as a trophy.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how craving (*Tanha*) leads to the "hungry ghost" realm—a state of **insatiable wanting and insecurity**, whether for a person, money, or status.

5.  **The Lion's Mane (Why the Throat Tenses):**
    *   **Story:** The speaker explains that a lion's mane may protect its throat during fights with other males, as the throat is the primary target for a lethal bite.
    *   **Purpose:** To give a biological, instinctual reason for why humans often hold tension in the throat—it's a **deep-seated self-preservation instinct** related to fear and vulnerability. This connects meditation (noticing bodily tension) to understanding instinctual drives.

### **Overarching Themes of the Metaphors & Stories:**
*   **Process vs. Event:** Shifting Western event-oriented thinking to a process-oriented understanding of the mind.
*   **Translation & Concept:** Using relatable images to bypass confusing translated terms (*Bhava, Jati, Vedana*).
*   **Instinct vs. Wisdom:** Contrasting automatic, instinctual reactions (which lead to suffering) with mindful, wise responses.
*   **Everyday Suffering:** Framing psychological states (anger, anxiety, mindless labor, greed) as the real "woeful realms" or "rebirths" we experience daily.
*   **Playful Engagement:** Encouraging a shift from seeing practice and life as a heavy burden to seeing it as an opportunity for playful exploration and joy.
