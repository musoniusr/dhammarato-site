### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Alright, well hello Thomas, glad to see you. So how's your practice going, tell me about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so recently instead of going into joy with Anapanasati, it feels like from dissatisfaction it's going straight, straight into this calmness, very pleasant, very relaxing, resting there, and feels like that's a place that I need to be in. And it is satisfying, but not really joy. And it also has this sense of expansion, spaciousness, and kind of sometimes like a dimension of sensations is opening on top of the quote-unquote normal day-to-day experience.

**Speaker A:** So a couple of questions. First off, um, do you like it better than, uh, the joy?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And the second question is probably more important, and then, well, what about when you're not practicing? What happens when you're out dealing with life? Is your default back to joy?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see. That means that you need to practice joy more so that that becomes your default. This is actually what the Buddha referred to in the sense of the middle path. Okay, don't go all the way into peace yet. You need to really In fact, knowing that you can go into peace, I would actually suggest that you spend a little bit of time in that state every time that you do practice, but also practicing those very wholesome thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine, wow, this is marvelous, all right, so that you can actually start to develop the skill and the skill set around that first Jhana so that when you come out of practice, that becomes your new default. All right, that the Buddha taught the middle path, and a lot of people don't really understand what the middle path is, and that the right way to understand it is, is that he taught the middle path as the first thing that he taught in his very first sermon. That was the first thing that he taught in his first sermon, was the middle path. And then he taught about the Four Noble Truths. But the way that it's translated, a lot of people misunderstand what the middle path is, because he's talking about the sensuality of that space of, let us say, emptiness, the higher jhanas. Now, the middle path that he was talking about for ordinary people would be the middle path between self-torture, self-emulation, self-flagellation, all of that kind of stuff, which not only the Buddha before he became the Buddha, the Bodhisattva, let's say, and the guys that he was talking to were all of them engaged in self-flagellation. And the Buddha was doing that because he found that the higher Jhanas were not what he was looking for. They were nice, but they weren't what he was looking for. He was looking for the end of suffering. All right, and so the whole idea then is the middle path is not some ordinary state between going to the brothels and beating yourself up with a hammer, that the middle path actually is between the self-flagellation which in a very interesting way would be having hindrances, having the ordinary mind, and then having that emptiness. And the place between those two is that joyful first Jhana. So that's the default position. The default position is the on top of the world, feeling that I can handle anything. No matter how obstructed the mind gets, we can come out of it and come back to see reality. So the default position actually is the first Jhana in the sense that it does have the noise of thought. Okay, the question is what kind of thoughts? Are there going to be unwholesome thoughts, which would be an extreme into the self-torture, the self-flagellation, except that we're doing it on a mental state? And going into the high Jhanas, which would be the ordinary person's equivalent of going to the races, going to the brothel, going to the bars, seeking out entertainment, because that's in fact what happens with the Jhanas. The deeper you go into them, the more pleasant it becomes, even in that voidness that you were beginning to experience. Okay, it's very pleasant. The Buddha talks about it in the sense of pleasure can be found wherever it may be found. Even in the void, even in nothingness, etc., like that. However, we need to find a middle place. Let us talk about it in the sense of traveling music. Do you understand what I mean by traveling music? You're out traveling.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yeah, how are you going to travel? Have you— of course, I know the answer to this question. It's a rhetorical question. Have you ever been to an airport? How many happy people do you find at an airport?

**Speaker B:** Not, not many. Not many.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. No. Okay. So the question is, when you go to the airport, can you go happily?

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yeah. If I remember to practice How some talks, right?

**Speaker A:** This is how we— that's actually one of the ways that I have said it is, is that 90% of all your practice is to apply the mind and sustain the mind in the wholesome, that first Jhana. Okay, now the second point about that is then the other 10% is going into these higher states where there's nothing much happening. Except that if we're not really well skilled in the first Jhana, then when we come out of those states, we go back into the ordinary hindrances. So what needs to be practiced over and over and over again is the ability to stay out of those hindrances joyfully to practice that first Jhana, to practice having wholesome, happy thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes the joy feels like it needs more energy than is kind of available.

**Speaker A:** We call that Right Noble Effort. Right. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That we have to put— now I will define right noble effort for you as just the least amount of effort to get the job done. It's going to take a little bit more effort, but just sitting there and breathing, even when there's nothing going on, we still need to breathe and pay attention to the breath and making sure that it's a long breath. May not be so long, but it's longer than normal to breathe while you're in that state of nothingness, to keep going with that. Okay, to don't let the breathing go shallow. And also any words that do come up should be happy words like, "Oh wow, I really like that." Okay, this is the whole point, is that we have to really fully develop that first Jhana, even though we have nice long gaps between the wholesome thoughts. We don't go from a wholesome thought to a gap to an unwholesome thought. We go from a wholesome thought to a gap, back to a wholesome thought. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought, with expanding gaps between the wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I've been practicing, and it kind of sometimes feels like the words, the wholesome thoughts that normally would bring a lot of joy It kind of like it doesn't have the energy to go up there. It just kind of brings this satisfaction and calmness to it. But then sometimes kind of really almost acting into the thoughts more can bring that joy, but it takes a lot of energy, like many, many times more energy than just saying that thought and going into the calmness and pleasantness.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that means now that you have a range of skills to work on, a range of skills to develop. That one, the skill of gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, bringing the mind up. It's always been, and many examples of that in the physical world, is that it's always a two-step process. You don't come from a negative up to a zero. You always have to come from a negative to the positive, from the nadir to the zenith, back to the asmas, back to the And the reason, if you can imagine it like that, is because we always want to end our journey on a downhill slide, not climbing up. So getting to the mountain peak is not a resting point. That's not your— that's not the journey. Imagine Mount Everest, how many corpses are up there because they stayed too long. Okay, that you don't stay on those peak places for very long, but when you come back down, that's coming back down to that rest. So don't go from ordinary mind into directly into no-thought, but rather work your way through the breathing and the gladdening the mind. Go through the process, enjoy that gladdening of the mind, and then go into the nothing for a while. And when you come back, come back into the taking the effort to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind, having wholesome thoughts. Wow, this is nice. Oh, I like that. That the end goal is not in those empty places. The end goal is to being able to walk around delighted. The end goal is having that, as I mentioned, that traveling music. Yeah, that first Jhana is our end goal. This is what the Buddha found out when he— it's actually, it might be worth reading it, the story is called The Story of the Rose Apple Tree, where he says that the first Jhana is in fact the path to enlightenment. That when he was practicing those higher Jhanas, when he would come out of the higher Jhanas, he was back to normal, back into hindrances. He finally had to recognize that the resting place is the first Jhana, where we are absolutely free from Dukkha, free from suffering, free from dissatisfaction, in a state of satisfaction during our walking around waking hours all the time, much of the time, most of the time. And when we fall into the hindrances, we've got the skill to come right back out of it into that bright, shiny mind state. And from there, it's easy to get into those higher Jhanas, the nothingness. A lot of people want to practice, "Oh, I've got to get to the highest Jhana," as if it were an ego trip rather than a natural progression of the downhill slide from having those marvelous states of the first Jhana. That in fact there's a way for practicing that, and that is that you can use the breath. And the way to use the breath is, as you breathe in long, you breathe in happily, and as you breathe out long, that's a sigh of relief, and then you leave the breath out which will then take the mind into nothing, and you want to continue that, you want to sustain that, at least until the time to take the next in-breath, which may be 3, 4, 5 seconds, 10 seconds if you're practiced. But when you breathe back in, you breathe back in with, again, "Wow, that was so nice!" This is really good stuff. To recognize and tell yourself about the great fruit, the great benefit of the Anapanasati on that next in-breath, and then the next out-breath again is relaxing. In fact, in Northern Thailand they talk about it in the sense of a mantra of "Bu" on the in-breath and "Do" on the out-breath, and as you end in "Do" and leave that out-breath, then you come down to a nothingness that's after the out-breath. And you leave that open, empty for a little while until the body needs the next in-breath. And with that, the mind will start back up. When it does start back up, let's make sure that it starts back up in the wholesome. You think you can practice like that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I definitely can.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this made it a lot more clearer on what to do. Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's go ahead and finish this call. You've got something to look at now, and recognizing that the base point is that happiness of the first Jhana, that satisfaction, that comfort, that ease, that when people practice wrongly, they'll go into the Jhanas, the high Jhanas, even with like the Buddha did, but when he came back, he was back to dissatisfaction. Make sure that when you come out of those states, that you come back to your resting point will be satisfaction. Wow, this is so nice.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this is so nice.

**Speaker A:** All right. Practice well, my friend. We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. See ya.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student (Speaker B), focuses on correcting a subtle but important imbalance in meditation practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Issue**
The student reports that during *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing), they are skipping the joyful, energized state of the first *jhāna* and going directly to a calm, spacious, and pleasant state of quietude (a higher *jhāna* or peaceful state). While pleasant, this state lacks the characteristic joy and energy of the first *jhāna*.

### **Dhammarato's Analysis & Guidance**

1.  **The Problem:** The student's default state outside of meditation is **not** one of joy. This indicates they are not sufficiently establishing the first *jhāna* as their baseline. Skipping to higher, emptier states is like taking a pleasant vacation but returning home to the same old problems.

2.  **The "Middle Path" Redefined:** Dhammarato reinterprets the Middle Path in this context. It is **not** between extreme sensuality and extreme asceticism for an adept practitioner. Instead, it is the middle ground between:
    *   **The "low" extreme:** The ordinary mind with its hindrances (self-critical thoughts, worry, etc.—a form of "mental self-flagellation").
    *   **The "high" extreme:** The blissful but empty states of the higher *jhānas* (which, for an untrained mind, can become a spiritual escape or "entertainment").
    *   **The True Middle:** The **first *jhāna***—a state of joyful, wholesome, energized satisfaction that is free from suffering but still contains wholesome thought.

3.  **The Primary Goal:** The ultimate aim is not to reside in empty stillness. The goal is to make the **first *jhāna* your "default setting"** or "traveling music" for daily life—a resilient state of happiness and satisfaction from which you can skillfully handle life's challenges. From this stable, joyful base, higher states arise naturally and safely.

4.  **Practical Instructions:**
    *   **90/10 Rule:** 90% of practice should be cultivating and sustaining the joyful first *jhāna*. Only 10% should be spent exploring the higher, quieter states.
    *   **Cycle of Breath & Thought:** Use the breath as a vehicle:
        *   **In-breath:** Breathe in long, with a gladdening thought ("Wow, this is marvelous!").
        *   **Out-breath:** Breathe out with a sigh of relief, relaxing into calm.
        *   **Pause:** After the out-breath, rest in the natural stillness/emptiness that arises.
        *   **Repeat:** When the next in-breath comes, begin again with a wholesome, joyful acknowledgment.
    *   **Right Effort:** The energy required to "gladden the mind" into joy is "Right Effort"—the minimal effort needed to do the job. Don't avoid it because stillness feels easier.

5.  **The Warning & The Story:** Dhammarato references the Buddha's experience under the Rose Apple Tree. The Buddha realized that even the highest *jhānas* were not the final goal, because upon leaving them, he would return to a mind with hindrances. The true path to enlightenment was found in establishing a **persistent freedom from *dukkha* (suffering)** in the waking state—the territory of the first *jhāna*.

### **Conclusion**
The student is guided to re-prioritize their practice. They should intentionally cultivate **joyful satisfaction (first *jhāna*)** as their foundation, using the breath to cycle between gladdening the mind and resting in calm. This ensures they build a resilient, happy mind for daily life, rather than using meditation as a temporary escape into peaceful emptiness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Middle Path as a Balanced Default State:**
   *   This is the central metaphor. Speaker A reinterprets the Buddhist "Middle Path" not as a compromise between extreme hedonism and extreme asceticism, but as a **mental default state between two other mental states**. On one extreme is the "self-flagellation" of the ordinary, hindered mind full of dissatisfaction. On the other extreme is the "sensuality" and "emptiness" of the higher, peaceful jhanas (like the calm state Speaker B is experiencing). The true Middle Path, and the desired default, is the **first jhana—a state of joyful, wholesome satisfaction**.

**2. Traveling Music:**
   *   This is a key metaphor for the **first jhana as a skill for daily life**. Just as you might have upbeat music to make a journey pleasant, the first jhana is the "traveling music" for navigating life. The airport example (a place where few people are happy) is used to illustrate that the goal is to be able to access this joyful state even in mundane or stressful situations.

**3. Mountain Climbing (The Downhill Slide):**
   *   Speaker A uses the image of climbing a mountain to explain the **energetic process of meditation**. The peak (a high, intense state) is not where you rest. Just as climbers don't stay on Everest's summit (where there are "corpses"), you shouldn't cling to peak meditative states. The goal is to **enjoy the "downhill slide"** back to a restful, joyful base camp (the first jhana). The journey should end on a relaxing descent, not an arduous climb.

**4. The Story of the Rose Apple Tree (a Buddhist narrative):**
   *   This story is referenced to give **scriptural authority** to the point about the first jhana. It recounts the Buddha's realization as a young boy that the first jhana (a state of joyful concentration) was the true path, not the higher, emptier states he later mastered but found to be temporary. The story reinforces that the **first jhana is the foundation and "resting place"** for enlightenment, not the higher jhanas.

**5. The Mantra "Bu-Do":**
   *   While not a story, this is a **practical, sensory metaphor** for the breathing cycle. "Bu" on the in-breath represents the **energizing, gladdening** aspect ("Wow, this is nice!"). "Do" on the out-breath represents the **relaxing, releasing** aspect, leading into the spacious calm. This metaphor structures the practice into a clear, rhythmic pattern of uplifting and letting go.

**6. Skill Development as a "Range of Skills" / "Skill Set":**
   *   The entire talk frames meditation as **skill development**, like building a toolkit. One skill is "gladdening the mind" to access joy, another is sustaining calm. Speaker B is advised to develop this "range of skills" rather than specializing only in the calm state.

**Summary:** The metaphors and stories work together to paint a clear picture: Don't get seduced by the pleasant calm of advanced states (**higher jhanas**). Instead, use the breath to cultivate a resilient, joyful mind (**first jhana**) as your **default setting** (the **Middle Path**). This joy is your **traveling music** for life. Build it through a rhythmic practice (**Bu-Do**) that involves climbing into joy and then sliding back into restful ease (**mountain metaphor**), a realization the Buddha himself had (**Rose Apple Tree story**).
