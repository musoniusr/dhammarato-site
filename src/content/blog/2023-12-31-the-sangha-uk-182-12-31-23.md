### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, is it started yet?

**Speaker B:** To let go but not being able to.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. So welcome to the Sunday Sangha. Uh, Amrit, where are you located?

**Speaker B:** So currently I am, uh, I'm in India.

**Speaker A:** You're still in India? Okay.

**Speaker C:** I will be in India also next.

**Speaker A:** Week, and 11th I will be back to Germany. All right, well, hello, Daniel.

**Speaker C:** Hello, everybody.

**Speaker A:** Hello, welcome. We just started the call. And, uh, Agnes in Sweden, and you're— I thought you were going to do the retreat at Deepa Bhavana.

**Speaker C:** Uh, that's right, next month.

**Speaker A:** Oh, next month, okay. Well, where are you now?

**Speaker C:** 10Th of January, uh, still at the same place, at the same— what?

**Speaker A:** Okay, sorry, I thought that you'd headed down here. We had already made arrangements to get your motorbike back to you.

**Speaker C:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome, guest user. Are you going to remain a mystery person? All right, so Agnes has asked a question about letting go, and Amrit also mentioned the word surrender, and that in fact what we've actually practiced in Anapanasati is making a positive change. Which is neither surrender nor letting go. That in fact, both of those are kind of passive, and that what we're doing is active. An example of that is letting go assumes that you're holding it like this, and all you have to do is ease your fingers and gravity will take it. Right, that's what we kind of mean by letting go. And that we want to make sure that the letting go, more like this, is that after you've let it go, you're still holding it. It hasn't fallen, it hasn't gone away, you're still holding it even though you've let it go. Does that make sense about the word letting go? Okay, so that's why I say that letting go is not the appropriate word to use, and certainly not surrender. That what we're actually doing instead is actively making a change. We're literally actively getting out of the way. That in fact, the letting go kind of wording can be understood with the concept of a particular kind of meditation practice that uses the concept of choiceless awareness. All right, kind of letting go or choiceless awareness, except that you're not letting go of it and the Dukkha is going to hit you anyway. And so if that's the case, then what value is your awareness? Because you're not making any choices, that you should in fact be able to get out of the way. So the little joke is that you're walking down the sidewalk and there's a pile of dog goo right in your path. Choiceless awareness is just going to ride right over it and step in it. All right, and the other extreme, which would also be just surrendering to it, that in fact surrender and letting go are kind of the same thing. Now, the Vipassana practice means that you're going to take great insight. You've got to study that dog pile. So instead of letting it go, the Vipassana meditators pick it up and take it into their kitchen and use their best cutlery to cut it open, maybe fry it, maybe sauté it, and try to make it palatable, etc., like this. So the better thing to look at— oh, well, hello, Carl! I was wondering who was signing in as guest user. So The right way to think of it is that as you see it in front of you, your job is to step out of the way of it. Your job is an active job, and don't just continue on the way that you were, but you've got to make a change. Now, that change that we're talking about is actually why the teaching of the Buddha I referred to is good in the beginning. Good in the middle, and good in the end, to where stepping in the dog doodle after you see it, is not so great in the beginning. And if people keep doing that, they'll not ever get out of beginning, they'll just stay at that beginner's place. And that the Vipassana meditation is the same kind of problem, is that they actually become really attached to it. I mean, they pick the darn thing up and take it into the kitchen, or they keep it in the mind and they dwell on it and they look at it and they see this dukkha is associated with that dukkha, and then they'll see how those two things are connected together, and then they start to go deep into it and they never really resolve the issue because the issue is not ever deep, but in fact the issue is right here, right now, right on the surface, right in front of you. That's the kind of way that we have to deal with you. All right, now this is actually following the Eightfold Noble Path. And the Eightfold Noble Path then means to Sati, to wake up, to look at where you're going. All right, and then you make the determination between the sidewalk and that dog doodle. And you recognize, no, I'm not going to step in it. And then you make that choice that you're not going there. The other way of talking about it, though, is to recognize when we've got unwholesome thoughts in the mind, that we can change those thoughts to wholesome thoughts. And it has to be done over and over and over and over again. This is a repetitive training process. I can imagine that a student who is interested in learning how to play the piano, would come on and say, I practiced for an hour or two, but I can't play anything, right? That's the whole point, is that it takes more than an hour or two of practice, and it takes it all day long. And we've got a real uphill battle in the sense that the guy who was playing or learning to play the piano has never had a piano against him, attacking him relentlessly. And yet that's what our habits do to us. What is referred to as the Samskara, or that pile of junk, keeps attacking us. It's almost as if we have chosen a path that is almost completely covered with cow pies and dog doodle. And so we have to be careful with every step. But we can make it true. Then in fact, one of the jokes that I tell is imagine that the farmer has the cows that are all on the other side of the pasture, and he's intent on going over there. And so as he walks across the pasture, he's keeping an eye on the cows. They may move and he's got to adjust his direction and all of that kind of stuff. But by the time he gets to the cows, he's going to be covered knee-deep in cow doodle, cow pie. Why? Because he's not watching where he's going, that he's future-oriented. The cows are way out there in the pasture, all right? And that our practice has to do with not recognizing, oh, the future sidewalk, that what part of the sidewalk we're going to be walking down a few minutes or a few hours from now is covered with dog doodle. The real issue is, can we see this cow pie right in front of us so that we can step aside of it, to make that choice to change this mind right here, right now? Now, here's one of the promises that is made with this in the Anapanasati Sutta, in the phrase of "Thus one trains oneself." If you train yourself in getting out of the way of the dog doodles, one step at a time, you get pretty good at it. And pretty soon you can laugh and sing and joke and dance your way down that sidewalk without ever getting stuck in a cow pie, even though they're all over the place. But you're watching and you're good at it. All right, now I had a friend, uh, actually he was, he was a monk, a Western monk. His name was David. And when we were talking and discussing about this at Wat Soan Mokkh when he was there, he came up with an analogy that I thought was really funny. And so I'll share it with you. Imagine that whatever, Agnes, that you wanted to let go of was kind of like a great big booger that came out of the nose. You know, you're digging in there and you find this giant— I mean, it's almost as big as the end of my finger, and I pull that thing thing out. I can't just let it go. It's sticky. It's sticky. You gotta flick that thing off and be careful of which way you flick it because you might step in it in a couple of minutes. All right, so this is the whole idea, is, is that this is taking something active to do. Our wiring is against us. Why? Because we have been literally walking on cow pies our whole mental life, going from one unwholesome thought to another, to another. Thoughts of greed, thoughts of "I don't like this," thoughts of "Oh, I've got this to do," thoughts of "Wow, this is hard"— all of those kind of thoughts that keep us stuck in a hindered position that we're not free, we're bound up by them. One of the kinds of thoughts that we have are the thoughts of doubt: "Oh, am I doing it right?" And the answer to that is, "Oh, I don't need to do that thought. I already know that I'm doing it right when I just change that thing and stop thinking about the doubts." But if I'm actually actively entertaining those doubts, then that's preventing me from being free. The same thing about worry, that in fact worry is something— I heard an example that I thought was quite useful. This guy, a Christian probably, said that worry is praying for something that you don't want. That's what worry is. Is praying or inviting something that you actually don't want. So we get worried. An example of that would be, oh, I didn't test that particular website page, maybe it's broken. And so I get all uptight about, oh, I've got to go fix that page, and when I get there, it's not broken. So why did I have all that worry? Go ahead, Agnes.

**Speaker B:** What could you give an example of? What could that be to pray about? Pray for something you don't really want.

**Speaker A:** All right, maybe I don't have enough money to pay the rent. Maybe I don't have enough money to pay the rent. Oh no, I might not have enough money to pay the rent. And what we're doing is, is that we're setting up a situation in our minds that we're already worried that we can't pay the rent. We really haven't even checked the bank account. We're worried about something that we might probably have some good control over, but we're not checking it out. We would rather be in misery instead. Maybe it's too much work to go over to the computer, fire it up, and check on the bank account. So I'll just sit here and worry about it. Worrying about something that's off into the future, that may never happen. So, there is a concept of being prepared. But many people think being prepared would be like, "Oh, maybe there is going to be a nuclear explosion, therefore let us go build a great big tunnel," in the backyard, put all of this expensive equipment in it. We've got to have filtration for the air, we've got to have our own battery systems, we've got to store up food for a long period of time. Oh my goodness, what a lot of work! But we might have that nuclear bomb come off, and we should do something about it, right? That's one kind of prepared, and that's an ordinary prepared. But look how much worry, how much effort, how much dog doodle there is in that way of doing it. A much better way of being ready for it is, "Oh, if we have a nuclear bomb, I'll be swept away." And then we don't have any worries. In other words, we can handle anything emotionally. And so that would be another example, is worrying about a nuclear war. I mean, Sweden's got a lot of worries about that, not you. So this is the kind of thing then we have to make sure that our thoughts are wholesome in the sense that I am not the victim, I'm the winner. Even if I get destroyed in my win I was going to get destroyed anyway, so why not be a winner at it? Be able to take it. If you're going to get executed, then be the best execution example that can exist. There's a lot of examples of that kind of thing happening. Mary Queen of Scots. She was beheaded, but she did it regally, royally. She put those executioners to shame when she went to the axe. There's another example of the guy saying, oh, well, my hair is so long and it's going to be in the way, and I want the axe man to get it. So will you have this guy over here hold my hair? And while he was holding the hair and the axe was coming down, he pulled himself back, and this guy that was holding the air lost the arm. So this is the kind of way that you can handle things. And if you can handle your own death nobly and happily, then guess what? You can handle anything, because there's not really anything that's that important. Being alive is the only important thing. Taking that next breath is an important thing. I keep trying to put this to the students that, "Hey, your breathing is vital. It's the most important thing in your life. It's about time you start paying attention to it." This is called Anapanasati. This is the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha, is that be aware of your breathing. Make sure that you're actually controlling it. That you're not breathing shallowly like you would normally do, let us actually start intentionally breathing well, getting the air that we actually could use, an abundance of it, so that you feel full of energy as opposed to feeling tired because you're not getting the right air. So, this comes back then to Amrit's point. When he was asking, well, isn't that the same thing as surrender? And the answer to that is, I don't know where surrender ever got into Buddhist language, but that's something that Islamic people do. That's what the word Islam means. It means to surrender because there's some great big sky daddy up there that's going to zap you with— I don't know what Allah uses to zap his Muslim folks, but Zeus had a trident, Thor had a hammer or something like that. But anyway, this is the whole thing of surrender— means that you don't want to fight anymore and you will subjugate yourself to that cow pie, the big one. And in fact, that's surrendering, is same, almost the same thing as choiceless awareness. Yeah, I see that cow pie out, let me make sure that I step on it correctly. Let me bow and scrape and oomby-doomy, gobbi-gobbi, oh, I am so sorry for being a human being. All of this kind of stuff, and it's very much a victim's position. And that we are used to doing that. You've already been surrendering far too much. I mean, when you're in the first grade, you surrendered to the school. You surrendered to your ABCs. You surrendered to your 1 through 3. 1, 2, 3s. You surrendered to cleaning up your room. You didn't want to do it, and here you are now, a grown adult, going around surrendering, doing what you're told to do and resenting it. This is surrender. There's a better attitude to have, and that is that I'll do it, but I'll do it on my own terms. And my terms are I'm going to enjoy doing it. Actually, Agnes, you and I had a conversation with a young musician who is in composition, and he is having to put out his own musical composition and hand it in to the teacher, and he's freaking out about it. The answer is, go ahead and do it. It doesn't matter whether the teacher likes it or not. The question is, are you going to write a composition that you enjoy doing. And when you enjoy doing it, it will wind up probably being pretty good. But if you don't want to do it, you're worried about the teacher, you're thinking that you're not up to it, "Oh, poor me, I'm not nearly as good a musician now as I was when they let me in the conservatory, I couldn't possibly write a composition for the teacher." And this is the mind state that we get into. That's the worry. So this is another example, a clear example, because you were right there with this guy when we both talked him out of having that attitude and bringing back the attitude of, why don't you forget about the teacher that you're trying mentally to surrender to by turning in the assignment that he wants? And why don't you instead Write a piece of music that you really love, you really enjoy doing. Now, how many have ever had an assignment like that, both in school or at work or whatever like that? I mean, this is the typical way that we live our lives, is we've been given work to do and we don't think that we're up to it, we don't think that we can do it, we get writer's block, we have all kinds of trouble, we get in burning the midnight oil and doing all of that kind of stuff, when in fact we could make the choice of either doing it and liking it, or not doing it at all. If you don't want to do it, why are you doing it? Why are you surrendering to this teacher? If you don't want to write the composition, why are you in the conservatory anyway? Why don't you go take a hike, sit under a tree, and enjoy life? So much for surrender, Amrit. Go ahead, Daniel.

**Speaker C:** Uh, what if you're forced to sit on the floor for an hour or longer and you get really uncomfortable?

**Speaker A:** All right, I tell you what, I have never seen a retreat center nor an old monk with a new monk, or an old monk with a wannabe monk, forcing them ever to do anything. I think that in fact when you're using the word forced, that's because you feel like that you've got to surrender. And in fact you're not being forced at all. You've got a full choice there. Are you going to sit on the floor and enjoy it? Are you going to sit on the floor and hate it because you were forced to do it? Are you going to quit because you don't think you can do it?

**Speaker C:** Well, I can do it, but it's really, really uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is, is that when it becomes comfortable, now who's the boss? Who is the boss? You, the little kid who is trying to follow orders? The big dude out there with those great big robes and all that gray hair that he keeps cutting off, is he the boss? Or is, in this case, is the body the boss? Isn't the body the one who is sending the message right now, saying, hey man, this hurts, why don't you help me out a little bit? And then you can adjust your posture. Maybe even you can get up and walk away from the monks and then come back 10 minutes later. They won't miss you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, they say if I want to be a monk, then I have to do the whole sit in one posture, and that's the posture that the Meiji normally sit in.

**Speaker A:** But it's like, right, okay, so maybe you're at the wrong place. If they're kind of requiring that stuff of you in your own mind. I don't think that they're in fact forcing you to do that. That's just what they are expecting. Now the question is, are you going to enjoy doing it up to your limit and then stop and then go back and start again and go up to your limit and stop and then come back happily and start again? And go up to your limit again and stop? Or are you going to push the limit because you think that you're being forced to push your limits? And in fact, nobody ever gets anywhere if they go beyond their limits. This happens often in a gym when people will force themselves and push too much weight or whatever like that, and then they're all stove up with pain and they can't make it the next day. Or the day after that. Then in fact, a lot of people who are actually training correctly and training well, they don't practice every day. They take a couple of days off and then they'll work out, and then they'll take a couple of days off and work out. It depends upon, in that regard, for you, as to if you're sitting too long right now, tomorrow it will be pain and it will be difficult to handle. And that you can learn to take it easy on yourself and build yourself up. I mean, you're not in a hurry to take on robes, are you?

**Speaker C:** That's what I realized, because the monk that's training me, he wants to like encourage me/push me to do everything.

**Speaker A:** I would see him as a friend. But you call them— you use the word forced, and force is not something that's done by a friend. He's a friend of yours.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, he actually realized that he was like pushing me too hard.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, okay, and so are you. Exactly. So learn what your limits are. Don't push too hard. And this old monk will figure that out also. I assume that if he's worthy of the respect that you're giving him He's not going to be blindly following some rule that he made up about how long you're supposed to sit. And let it be a training, a training that you enjoy doing. And it doesn't matter how long it takes, the question is, can you sit happily for a short period of time, and then later sit happily for a short period of time, not even recognizing that these short periods of time are getting a little longer and a little longer until you overdo it, and then you're in pain again. That lasts. And then, in fact, I have seen a number of occasions— I used to have a whole group of them that I would count, because this is an important point. All of these guys that I'm about to mention were ordained, and every one of them had trouble in one way or the other. One of the ways that they had trouble was because they quit the Sangha. But another more common one is that they will remain a monk, but they won't be around other Thai monks. They don't want to be around them because they can't sit. Why can't they sit? Because it hurts too much. Why does it hurt too much? Because they keep pushing themselves, and pretty soon they can't even sit on the floor at all. That hurts too much. So what do they do? They go slink off into a, uh, let us say, a solitary retreat center where they're the only one. They're the star of the show in their own minds. They're either living in some layman's garage, or maybe they've got a layman to build a, uh, a whole forest retreat center for them. Okay, and this has happened. It happened to, uh, Bhante Palo was like the first one, and he ruined his knees. He could hardly walk. Another one was Vela Maramsi. If you'll notice, you never see him sitting on the floor. He has to sit in a chair, and therefore he does not stay around other monks. Another one is Subbato. He was here, but he couldn't stand being at Wat Soen Mokkh because he couldn't sit with the rest of the monks, and they expected him to sit with them for breakfast and other times, and he couldn't do it. So he left, but he found a friend in Malaysia that would house him. So he's not in the Sangha. But this issue about your knees and being able to sit a long time winds up destroying your monkhood. So please be careful. Listen to your knees, listen to your back, listen to your body, and do not push it into these postures that the Asians have been sitting in their whole lives.

**Speaker C:** The same for Dhamma Vipassana. He's also using a walking stick.

**Speaker A:** It happens. Westerners get into that, oh, I've got to sit like the Thai monks, and they can't. I was, I guess, kind of lucky. I learned slowly over a period of a number of years trying to get into and then maintain the lotus posture, so that by the time that I'd gotten to watch someone milk, I could sit in the lotus posture for an hour. I can still get in it, but I can't stay there. But the point that I want to make, though, is that I've got a daughter, a stepdaughter. I met her when she was 11 years old, and she was already sitting eating her food on the floor in the full lotus posture. Every time I see her eating on the floor, she sits in the full lotus posture. Why? Because she can. She's been doing it her whole life. A lot of Thai people can sit in the lotus posture because they've been doing it their whole lives. So don't expect yourself to do something that needs training. And not only that, but the point is, is that why? It's a traditional thing, but the point— and actually, there's some practicality around it. In other words, if you're going to go on tudong with all of the other monks, are you going to have the extra burden of carrying your couch or your chair with you? How about a bed? You want to carry a bed too? So the whole idea of the monk— and in fact, I learned this before I was ordained. I was traveling in India and began to understand that What I need to own is what I can carry. And if I can't carry it, it's not mine. I can't pick up a bed and walk, so I'm going to leave the bed where it is, give it away or something. Same thing with the chair. So that's the idea. The old idea behind it is, is the monks are ready to go. Hey, you want to go to New Zealand? Yeah, I've got my bowl and my robe. Let me get on, I'm ready now. They're all packed up and ready to go. And that's why monks do a lot of traveling, is because they can, because they are not attached to any furniture. So that's kind of a goal for you, and you can be pleased that you can get up to that a little bit at a time. A little bit every day, sitting for 10 minutes now, and then 10 minutes an hour from now, and then 15 minutes 3 hours from now, and pretty soon you'll work it up. No problem. Until you hear that you've been forced to do it. And now all of those painful thoughts come up about, "Oh, they're doing it to me," and, "Oh, I want to rebel," and, "Who wants to be a monk anyway?" and all of this kind of stuff. Right. But if you have the attitude, oh, I can train for that. Oh, I can do that. I'm going to be gentle on my body. I'm going to be restful. Now, this application that I'm talking about right now actually can be applied to almost anything. It can be applied to dance, music, sports, arguing with your mother-in-law, any activity that you can think of, the way to do it is to go into it slowly with the idea of training. That in fact, all the martial arts train slowly to get it right. It's a whole lot more important to get it right over and over and over again, so when you speed it up, you're still doing it right. And so this is what I would recommend, is go sit right, slowly, and build up. Don't put it as a marathon, don't try to get something that you don't have, but enjoy the training. Because this is the important point, is to train your mind. You're not training your body anyway, you're training your mind to be responsive to the body. To look at it and say, oh, can I handle that pain right now? Yeah, I can handle it. It is okay. Can I handle it now? No, it's getting a bit much. It's time to move. It's time to stand up and walk around, and then I can come back and sit down.

**Speaker C:** Would you say it's too much when your mind gets hot, or when your body gets too painful?

**Speaker A:** Well, the body can get really painful, but the mind refuses to look at it because the mind's got this idea of, "Oh, I've got a training to do, and to hell with the body." No, what we're talking about here is the mind becoming attentive to what the body actually needs, so that you're not causing yourself any Dukkha right here, right now. And calling bodily sensations pain, is Dukkha. If you don't like those sensations, that's the Dukkha, is that you don't like what the body is telling you. Instead of letting the body be a messenger and saying, this is what we need to do right now, we need to get up and move, get the circulation back, I've had about as much of this sitting as I can stand. Little joke there. So this is how we begin to practice. And surprisingly enough, you will gain the skill that you need a little bit quicker than if you work too hard at it and have to deal with the pain. And you can go all right over the hill in the way that those group of monks that I've been talking about, that they can't sit at all without the pain coming back immediately. They've gone too far. They worked too hard. They wanted to be good monks. Don't try to be a good monk now, try to train your body so that you can sit comfortably. But in fact, that's an important point about Anapanasati. Step 3 is get to know the body so that you can make it comfortable. So that it can relax. How can you relax the body according to the Anapanasati Sutta if you're sitting there in pain? Who can relax while they're in pain? Now that's a skill. Most people don't. I don't even think Arahants bother to develop that skill. That in fact, I would go so far as to say, is that the strong determination settings that Goenka uses is exactly that, is getting people to be able to tolerate a great amount of pain. Well, this is not what we're practicing. We're not practicing tolerating a great amount of pain. We're practicing finding where our limits are and then pushing them slowly, easily, as we develop skill. This is the correct way of doing martial arts also, is to find out where your limits are and train within your limits so that the limits will expand. And sometimes you have to deal with things, like an example of that would be getting sick. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says, "Oh, well, getting sick, that's just an excellent time to practice." And yet most beginning meditators, "Oh, I'm too sick to meditate." 'Oh, that's too much.' And in fact, this kind of meditation that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking about is merely changing your attitude about the body being sick. 'Oh yeah, the body's sick, I can let it lay here and rest, give it an easy time, we'll get over it. I'll be feeling good very soon. Let me take a few deep breaths and let the body feel good and relaxed.' That's the right attitude. That's the correct practice. As for me, I'm so sick I can't possibly meditate right now. I'm about to die. You know, that's all that surrender stuff. Amrit, did you hear that?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I have one question, Dhammarato. Yes, so in Anapanasati Sutta So the most important thing we are training is attitude.

**Speaker A:** I would say that that is absolutely the number 4 on the list, and we need to develop 3 skills before we get there. And that's the 4th on the list, but it's not the end of the list. Okay, so let's go over that a little bit. The first item on the list is the twin concept of remembering to look, the right noble view that is developed through remembering to have the right noble view. So going back to Daniel, recognize that when you don't like the sitting, that you've got a choice about it. One of the choices is to shift your posture. Another choice you have is to get up and walk around. Another choice you have is, let me see if I can push this just a little bit, and then I'll take a rest. Those are the various choices you have, but the kind of choices most of them make is, oh, I want to be a monk so bad, and this hurts so bad, and oh, I'm in a conflict now. Right? You're in that— Right. So, this is how the mind normally works. And that you can in fact make a change if you can see that that's what the mind is doing. You say, hot dog, I caught it that time, and now I'm going to sit here happily even though there's a little bit of pain. I can do that happily. I can handle a little bit of pain. It's just a sensation after all. I'm the one who's calling it pain. Nobody knows how much trouble I've got right now except me. And so you begin to push your limits just a little bit, but not overdoing it. This is the whole point, is that what is your attitude? Is your attitude the attitude of a winner and 'I can do this'? Then you will develop that actual effort, the fourth item on the list, with this right effort of finding out where your limits are and pushing it just a little bit, but always taking the right effort. Then that fourth item that's called in the Pali Samma Sanghappa. This is what we can use in English is the word confidence. I can do this. I can train my body. I can let it go a little bit longer. Look, I used to be in pain after 10 minutes and now I can sit for 11. Wow. That's progress. And start looking at the success that you have instead of the failure. Look at the success, see the success, build on the confidence of that success. So the way that we then talk about the Eightfold Noble Path, and it resolves to the Anapanasati Sutta, especially step number 6, and that is the word Sukkha. What is the Sukkha that we're developing? We're developing Sukkha of, "I'm not afraid that I'm going to hurt my body. I'm not afraid of anything. In fact, I feel safe and secure while I'm practicing, not going to hurt it, not going to push myself." With that, we begin to develop the comfort so that you can sit comfortably, relax the body, that in fact all the tensions are coming from the fact that you can't relax. All of that tension is causing that pain, is lack of relaxation. So you can actually intentionally start to see the tensions in the body, whether they're in the legs or in the back or in the neck or in the shoulders or wherever it is, and intentionally relax it. Become comfortable sitting comfortably. Sitting upright is best, because if you're sitting over it leaning, then gravity is pulling you down and causing these muscles to strain. But if you sit up straight, and every time you take a breath, you pull yourself up just a little bit more, and then when you breathe out, you relax straight down. And so continuing to in and out, raise your body on the in-breath and then relax and relax and relax. This is the way that we practice. And with that then begins to build the confidence of I can do this, I can make myself comfortable, I can feel safe and secure. And in this case also, I'm beginning to get satisfied with the way that I'm sitting. I can sit. I'm satisfied. And then after it goes from 11 minutes to 12 and to 15 and to 20 and to 25, so does that confidence begin to grow. I can do this is the way to look at it. We're not surrendering to the body, we're conquering the body with that attitude. I'm the winner here. I can sit. I can sit. That's the kind of attitude that you begin to have. I'm the winner here. I can do this. It might take me 2 weeks, or it might take me a year. I can do it. This is changing that attitude out of the surrendering victim's mentality into the winner's mentality, the lion. The Buddha was known as a lion. Right? He was not known as a surrendering wimp. He was a bull. He trained that way. You can train your mind that way too, so that you can handle anything. This is the way that we're training. This is that fourth ingredient, that we get that confidence that you can handle anything. You can laugh anything off. You can handle anything that's happening, even your own death. What are you going to do, mess up your death? No, we can handle that. I can handle dying. What does not being able to handle dying mean? It means that I survived, I'm still alive? I don't think so. No, it has to do with our attitude about how we can handle things. And so that's part of this process of the practice of Anapanasati, the meditation, is changing from that position of success, not surrender, not acceptance, but success at being able to sit. And that comes from satisfaction. I'm satisfied that I can sit, and later I become successful at it. And that success is what's going to build up into that confidence, and that's what gives you that wow feeling for life. Wow, you're alive, guys! Don't you get that? It's marvelous that you're alive! You survived! It didn't matter what happened in the past, you survived it. You can survive the next breath. And so this is the kind of attitude that we gain, is that we're successful, we're going to survive this. So as we practice that survival, as we practice that success, the mind then becomes unified. You see, the victim's mind is disjointed, it's out of kilter, it's in argument, it's in duality. One of the ways of looking at it is that you've got a superego or apparent state that's giving you all these rules, Daniel, about you should be able able to sit for 45 minutes, darn you, why can't you do it? All right, and so that causes the duality. And when we stop hassling ourselves, because we already give ourselves credit for 'I can do it,' yeah, I can't sit for 45, but I can sit for 30 now. I'm doing it, so get off my case already. So once we get off of our own case, once we stop with all of the rules and the shoulds about what you're supposed to do and start enjoying what you can do, then the mind becomes more organized, it becomes more unified. An example of this would be that when the doubt is eradicated, the mind becomes more whole. Why? Because when we're in doubt, is the mind over here, is it over there, is it scattered, we're worried, it's all over the place, and we don't feel at home, we don't feel settled, we don't feel unity. But when we practice with this success and gain that feeling of being a winner, then the mind becomes organized on its own. This is actually part of the Eightfold Noble Path. This is the fifth item of the path, the Samadhi mind, the mind that comes together. And when the mind is whole, when it is not wanting anything, that it feels safe and complete all by itself, then the mind doesn't want anything. If the mind doesn't want anything, then you're unlikely to beat yourself to death or even kill somebody else because they're trying to make you do something. You're not going to go kill somebody to get something because you don't want anything. You're not going to go steal something if you don't want it. You're not going to go lie about it. And so this is where the precepts or the Sila or the morality actually comes from, is that it comes from the mind that is noble, that it's together. And so let's repeat that little sequence of events so that you'll know how to get the mind into that state. Number 1, is the combination of right view and the remembering to look. Look at what you're doing, look at the unwholesome thoughts that you have. And then number 3, the big item that's often missed in Western Buddhism is to make a change, to come out of that unwholesome state of, oh, poor me, my leg hurts, or, oh, poor me, my back hurts, into let me sit up straight and see if that helps. 'Oops, let me move the leg around, let me give it some circulation, let me stand up and walk around, and I'll get it done.' So it has to do with an attitude that comes from making the change from 'poor me, I gotta give in.' And so we develop that attitude, we develop it right along. But when the attitude grows, it grows into this thing called Samma Sanghappa. The right noble attitude: I can do it. That's what brings about the unification of mind, is that confidence. And with that right unification of mind comes our morality. People who steal are victims. Oh, I need that money. Oh my goodness. 'Elon Musk has got more money than I do. I feel so insecure. Let me go steal $1 billion. No, I need to steal $100 billion, or maybe $300 billion, and then I'll feel OK.' Right. So this comes from feeling insecure. When we change that attitude of feeling safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied, That then leads to that state of success. So build up that success. Don't succeed in the sense of, I have to wait until I can sit longer than the monks can, but look at the little successes along the way, so that you feel like a success all along the way, so that it's good in the beginning. Good in the middle, and then it'll be really good in the end. You can sit with them. I know you can, David, but not when you say that they're forcing you to do it. Oh, what a victim that is. So this is the Eightfold Noble Path that the Buddha teaches, and this is the right way to practice to come out of our Dukkha, to come out of our dissatisfaction, to come out of our pain. To be able to handle anything. But we have to train for it over and over and over and over and over again, over and over again. This is a very repetitive process, but I don't know of anything that has instant success. How about professional gamblers? Do they just start winning from the beginning? I don't think so. How about classical musicians that walk out on stage with 100 people or 1,000 in the audience and clapping and, "Oh, he's so wonderful!" Do you think they got that by sucking their fingers instead of playing the Anagamis with them? Oh no, they had to practice. Everything that you want in life is going to require practice. The point of it here is, can you enjoy your practice, or do you hate it? Because I have seen piano students, they didn't like playing the piano, they didn't stay in class very long, they quit. Don't quit your practice of Anapanasati, don't quit your meditation. Start enjoying it instead. Change your attitude about it, that you can do this. So this, going back to what Agnes was talking about, a letting go— no, you're not letting go. You're not surrendering. You're overpowering. You're the winner here. You're going to train yourself so that you can manage it. You can throw that thing off, and it's going to be sticky. The pain's going to come back, and you're not going to like it. And then you remember, oh, that's right, I can train with this. I don't have to feel bad, I don't have to not like the pain, I can deal with it wisely. And this actually is the way that we do everything. This is not just pain, this is arguments that we have with the boss, this is the email that we don't want to write, this is the IRS check we don't want to do, the income tax we don't want to fill out, the trip to the bank, the trip to the grocery store, going to work. I mean, you guys in the West create a hell for yourself. Look how many things you have to do that you don't want to do because you've gotten yourself in the habit of not wanting to do stuff and doing it anyway. Go ahead, Agnes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think For me, it's more about letting go of those old destructive habits.

**Speaker A:** You can't let them go. You got to kick them in the butt. You got to throw them out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. That's the wrong word. Yeah, but I stopped doing so many kind of intoxicating things that's really destructive for my body.

**Speaker A:** I know that's the surrendering. You surrender to the alcohol or you surrender to not watching the pain. Like, uh, no, yeah, you don't do it anymore. That's the whole point, is that you made that change. That's a positive, wholesome change that you made. And you didn't just let go of the alcohol, that— and in fact, you probably had to pry it out of your own cold, dead hands.

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, that was not the problem eventually, uh, but, but it's more about what do I do now? It's like making that change.

**Speaker A:** Congratulate yourself right away. Congratulate yourself. Wow, I'm glad I don't get drunk anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that's wonderful. Congratulate everybody. Congratulate Agnes. She doesn't get drunk.

**Speaker C:** Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** It's more about all those other things, the smoking, the poison, the things that are really destructive.

**Speaker A:** That's to let— name one, name one.

**Speaker B:** What? Smoking.

**Speaker A:** All right, now everybody has the idea of, 'I've got to quit smoking,' right? And that's also off into the future. 'I've got to quit smoking,' just like, 'Oh, I've got to learn to sit for a long time to please the monks,' is always future-oriented. Here's how you handle the cigarettes, is that as you're lighting that last cigarette, or the current cigarette, as you're lighting it up, you'll say, wait a minute, right now I can do without that darn thing. And you set it down.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, that's the thing. That's the thing. For me, it's been about making a decision to— this is not an option anymore. It's more like I had to make that decision and really stop doing it.

**Speaker A:** But you always stop doing it right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Because you sometimes will fail at that. Sometimes you'll light that cigarette up.

**Speaker B:** No, that's the thing. When I made the decision, I don't do it again. So, for me, it's a lot about coming to that point when I can make the decision to really stop. So, I've been doing it many times over and over again with different things. I didn't just stop smoking, I stopped many things in that way. But there are still things that I need to kind of stop doing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let's go with that then. Because even though you make the choice of physically not doing it, you still have those moments when the desire to smoke comes up. Now, the easy way to handle that is by not being anywhere near any cigarettes. You don't buy them anymore, there's none in the house. It's a whole lot easier to quit smoking when there's none around, but it's hard to quit smoking when the pack is sitting right in front of you. Right. So that's part of the decision is let's get them away so that it's a lot of work to light up.

**Speaker B:** But not even that, not even that, because actually I quit smoking, I think, 20 years ago. But the thing is, when I really want to smoke, it's like I make a decision in my mind. If I want to smoke, I just go and buy the cigarettes. It doesn't matter if it's in front of me or not. It's kind of the same thing for me, because when I got all the.

**Speaker A:** Way though that you were going to get those cigarettes, you still, every step you took, had a choice. I didn't know, am I going to continue to go after the cigarettes or am I going to stop going after them right now? No, you're still looking at the long term and I'm asking you to look at the short term. The right here, right now quality of it, that even though you've made a vow, I'll never do it again, still you're tempted and you have to deal with that temptation for it right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** That's more about.

**Speaker C:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** That's why you ask about letting things go. You have to actually throw them out right here, right now. That in fact, the Buddha talks about renunciation or a vow as an ordinary thing that ordinary people do. It's not noble. Why? It's because there are so many people, Agnes, who have decided to quit smoking, and an hour or two or the next day, they're smoking again.

**Speaker B:** I think my question would be more like, what do I do instead?

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is say no right now rather than trying to plan on for the future. So when you're in the store, listen to me, when you're in— let's use the example of the cigarettes because that's an easy enough example. We can use it for books. I could vow to never read another book. How am I going to handle that? Is by not buying any books. And I can sit at home. I can vow to never use the cell phone. But if I got it charged up and on and in front of me, it's tempting. But if I dash that cell phone and now I don't have one, then it's a whole lot easier to do without it because I don't have it.

**Speaker B:** For me, it actually has been better for me to know I can actually smoke if I want to. If I make the decision— Well, you.

**Speaker A:** Could already do that, just like Daniel already knows that he can move anytime he wants to. Everybody already has the ability to mess up. Everybody's quite an expert at messing up. The question is not, can you mess up? The question is, can you remember right now and not make that mess? To remember right now, to change it into something wholesome.

**Speaker B:** I can, I can remember, and then I start feeling bad when I actually Well, shoes or whatever word you want to call it, to still do it. I could still do it even if I remember.

**Speaker A:** That's the thing. That's the whole idea then of taking the right noble effort, is that once you see that it's unwholesome, don't step in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense to me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, don't step in it when it's right there in front of you. So the easy way out is to be miles and miles away from the cigarettes, the tobacco, the people you argue with. Don't ever go near them. That in fact, this is the whole quality that the Buddha talks about in the sense of seclusion, that whatever ticks your clock, get away from it. Get away from other people for a while. Get away from the job occasionally. Get away from it. That we need to practice Anapanasati when we've got very, very little going on, so we make sure we seclude ourselves. So here we're talking about just secluding ourselves from alcohol, secluding ourselves from tobacco, or in Daniel's case, secluding himself from your being forced to sit. Seclude yourself from those unwholesome kind of situations. And so now you can handle it in this present moment, but you have to take the energy— it has to take the effort, rather— that makes sense.

**Speaker C:** No.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just say no, I will not have that unwholesome thought. No, I am not going to plan on killing my mother-in-law. I'm going to plan on being friends with her.

**Speaker B:** But then I would have to have an option to doing that, because if I don't have a reason for not doing it, I would need to have some kind of, well, like— But that's.

**Speaker A:** The whole point, is that when you see the Dukkha, you see that it's unwholesome. This is the whole point of the Four Noble Truths, is to be able to see Dukkha so that we don't step in it. We can see it. So in the case of tobacco, when you see that, oh, it's unhealthy to take that next cigarette, I can stop taking it right now.

**Speaker B:** And well, I still do it even if I know it's unhealthy, even if I know it's going to kill me. I could still do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. All those who still smoke can say exactly what you just said. Yeah, of course you can do it. That's the whole point. The question is, can you take the right noble effort to not do it, to stop? Go ahead, Daniel.

**Speaker C:** I've actually struggled with a similar problem, and that is that I would eat a lot of sugar every morning, and I found that I wanted to renounce it every time And then I said to myself, okay, this is not working, so I'm just going to stop renouncing it. And then I noticed that when I stopped renouncing it, then it's not a big thing anymore, and it's much easier on myself because I don't put so much pressure on myself. But renunciation makes it really, really hard on yourself.

**Speaker A:** And when there's no sugar here, you're not thinking about it. Out of sight, out of mind. The issue is when the sugar is right there in front of you Can you say no to it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can. Actually, I can do that when I have, but it's more like when it comes, the idea comes into my mind, I can have it. It's more like I allow myself to having the toxics or something, and then I just go get it. It doesn't matter if it's in front of me or at the grocery store, I still get it when I decided to get it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And you also have the ability to nurture yourself into saying, I don't need it right now. I can do without it right now. I'm strong enough to handle not having that cigarette right now. That's the kind of attitude that we're actually developing here. It's not a matter of letting go, as you were asking, and it's certainly not a matter of surrendering. What it really is is a matter of taking the right noble effort to stop doing it, to stop even the unwholesome thoughts, to stop the unwholesome cigarettes, to stop the unwholesome arguing. All of that, if we can remember to stop— that in fact, that's a really important word for the— within the Buddhist context, it comes from the Angulimala Sutta, where the Angulimala says to the Buddha, stop Monk, stop! The Buddha says, I have stopped. You stop too. Okay, can you just merely stop? Can you stop hassling yourself about people forcing you to sit? Can you stop feeling sorry for yourself when the pain comes and deal with it wisely? This is the point. Anicca, can you stop surrendering when you don't get what you want and stop wanting it and say, I'm fine without it. I can handle it. Yeah, I didn't get that cigarette. I'm still okay. Or yeah, I didn't get that raise. I'm still okay. Whatever it is that we want that we don't get, that's Dukkha. Can we change that? Can we stop wanting things and start being satisfied with the way things are right here, right now, in this moment? Aren't things good enough right now? I mean, literally, Marcus, aren't things good enough right now?

**Speaker C:** They are.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Martin? Or isn't everything good enough right now? Are you satisfied?

**Speaker C:** Totally satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, just maintain that position of 'I'm satisfied.' You don't have to warn anyone. Hello, I don't know you. What's your name? Hello, my name is Sandra. Sorry if my English is bad. Sorry, mine is too. I've got a southern accent. Nobody can understand a word I say. But I'm glad to see you here. I'm glad to see you smiling, because this is what it's all about, is to learn to smile at whatever it is that's happening, because it's not that big a deal anyway. The only really big deal is, can we stay alive? Can we be happy in this present moment? But we have to take effort to do that, because we're in such a habit of being unhappy, disappointed, wanting things we can't have. So, can you remember to look at what you want? And then say, I don't need that right now, I'm happy without it. That's all this practice is, is learning to be happy and satisfied even when we don't get what we want. By how? By stop wanting.

**Speaker B:** That makes sense. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes. Well, this takes practice. Yes, practice over and over again. Every time you want something, can you say, oh, I don't get what I want, I'm unhappy, let me stop wanting it and then I'll be happy? I try. I will try. Try it over and over and over and over again. The more you do it, the better at it you'll get. Thank you. All right, glad to meet you. Pedro, how are you today?

**Speaker B:** Oh, cool. It's a very beautiful talk.

**Speaker A:** Like, it can be applied to anything, actually. Yes, this applies to anything, anything that causes us grief, pain, torture, dissatisfaction, little niggles of dislike. We can handle it. Yeah, so Daniel, what do you have to say?

**Speaker C:** Uh, yeah, I think we've discussed everything already. Yeah, not much more. Uh, good talk.

**Speaker A:** Good. How about you, Amrit?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think, uh, this was a great talk, so The learning for me is I should surrender the letting go and I should let go the surrender.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I think you ought to pack them up and ball them up in your hand and throw them away, long away. Take some effort, throw them out. This is the teaching of the Buddha that so many people miss, is that we've got to take some effort. We got to put the right effort in. Definitely. All right, guys, does anybody have any last things to say?

**Speaker C:** I think it's really interesting that we've talked about the same topic so many times.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is the only talk I know. Is how to stop doing stuff that's painful.

**Speaker C:** But I mean, like, it's, it's still really helpful even though I've heard it already 50 times, because it's like you start realizing it at a deeper and deeper and deeper level.

**Speaker A:** So let us not say deeper and deeper, let us say more often. And more often I can remember it, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But that's what we're shooting for. We're not shooting for anything deep. We're shooting for what's right there in front of us. Can we handle that right here and right now? Can you remember to stop hurting your legs because you're forced to and start enjoying your sitting? Well guys, this has been a great talk. I've really enjoyed it, and I think it's about time to stop. Enough for today.

**Speaker C:** Thank you very much, everybody.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, everybody.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends Agnes (B), Daniel (C), and others, centers on a critical re-examination of the common meditation concepts of "letting go" and "surrender."

Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### Core Argument: Active Change vs. Passive Letting Go
Dhammarato argues that "letting go" and "surrender" are misleading, passive terms. True practice is about **active, positive change**.
*   **Letting Go is Flawed:** It implies simply opening your hand and allowing something to fall away by gravity. The problem is we often "let go" but mentally still hold on—the issue doesn't actually leave.
*   **Surrender is Flawed:** This implies submission or victimhood, giving in to an unwanted state (like a "cow pie" or "dog doodle" on your path).
*   **The Correct Method:** The practice is **actively getting out of the way**. It is making a conscious, wholesome choice to change your mental or physical state *right now*.

### Central Analogies & Explanations
1.  **The Sidewalk & Dog Doodle:** Life is like walking down a sidewalk littered with dog mess (suffering/dukkha). The goal isn't to studiously analyze it (Vipassana caricature) nor blindly step in it ("choiceless awareness"). The skill is to **see it and actively step around it**.
2.  **The Sticky Booger:** Some mental habits are like a sticky booger—you can't just "let it go"; you must **actively flick it away**.
3.  **The Future-Oriented Farmer:** Don't be like a farmer so fixated on cows in the distance that he walks knee-deep in manure. Keep your attention on the **present step** to avoid the "cow pie" right in front of you.

### Practical Application to Common Issues
*   **Meditation Pain (Daniel's issue):** When sitting causes pain, don't "surrender" to a rigid ideal or force yourself. **Actively adjust**. Listen to your body, change posture, stand up, and build duration gently and happily. The attitude should be "I can train this" rather than "I am forced to endure."
*   **Breaking Habits (Agnes's issue):** Quitting smoking or other destructive habits isn't about a distant vow. It's about the **moment-by-moment choice** to not engage *right now*. Create supportive environments (remove temptations) and congratulate yourself for each successful present-moment decision.
*   **Worry & Doubt:** Worry is "praying for what you don't want." Doubt asks, "Am I doing it right?" The active change is to **stop that thought stream** and return to the confident, wholesome practice.

### The Framework: The Eightfold Path & Anapanasati
Dhammarato frames this active approach within the Buddha's core teachings:
1.  **Right View & Mindfulness (Sati):** Remember to look at what's happening in the mind.
2.  **Right Effort:** Actively abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome.
3.  **Right Attitude/Intention (Samma Sankappa):** Cultivate a **confidence of "I can do this."** Shift from a victim mentality ("poor me") to a winner's mentality ("I can handle this").
4.  **Unification & Morality:** This confident, successful attitude unifies the mind (Samadhi). A mind that is satisfied and doesn't crave naturally upholds ethical precepts (Sila).

### Key Takeaway Message
The path is **not passive acceptance but active training**. It requires repetitive practice, like learning an instrument. The goal is to develop the skill and confidence to **"laugh and sing and dance your way down the sidewalk"** of life, skillfully navigating around suffering by making positive changes in the present moment. The ultimate attitude to cultivate is: **"I am satisfied. Things are good enough right now. I can stop wanting and be happy."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate the core teaching: that overcoming suffering (dukkha) is an active, skillful process of making positive changes, not a passive "letting go" or "surrender."

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Dog Doodle / Cow Pie on the Sidewalk**
This is the central, extended metaphor.
*   **Passive "Letting Go":** Compared to holding an object and just opening your fingers, expecting gravity to take it. The problem is, you might still be holding it even after "letting go."
*   **Choiceless Awareness:** Critiqued as walking right over the dog pile and stepping in it.
*   **Over-Analysis (Vipassana):** Compared to picking up the dog pile, taking it to the kitchen, and dissecting it with cutlery—getting overly attached to analyzing the problem.
*   **The Correct "Active" Approach:** **Stepping out of the way.** Seeing the unwholesome thought or habit (the "doodle") and actively choosing to avoid it, changing your path.

### 2. **The Sticky Booger**
Used to emphasize that some mental habits are not easy to release passively.
*   You can't just "let go" of a big, sticky booger; you have to **actively flick it away**. It requires a deliberate, energetic action to be rid of it.

### 3. **Learning a Skill (Piano, Martial Arts)**
Used to illustrate the nature of the practice.
*   You can't play piano after an hour of practice; it requires **repetitive, consistent training all day long**.
*   Unlike a piano student, our "habits" (samskaras) are actively attacking us, making the training an "uphill battle."
*   Correct training is like martial arts: start slowly, get it right, build up skill gently within your limits, and enjoy the process.

### 4. **The Farmer Crossing the Pastory**
A story to warn against future-oriented worry.
*   A farmer is so intent on watching the cows on the *other side* of the field that he doesn't see the cow pies directly in front of him and walks knee-deep in dung.
*   **Moral:** Don't be so focused on future problems or goals that you miss the unwholesome thought/choice **right in front of you** that you can avoid now.

### 5. **Worry as "Praying for What You Don't Want"**
A borrowed metaphor (attributed to a Christian source).
*   Worry is likened to actively inviting or praying for an outcome you fear. It's an unwholesome mental activity that creates its own suffering.

### 6. **Facing Execution Nobly (Historical Anecdotes)**
Stories used to illustrate the ultimate attitude of a "winner."
*   **Mary, Queen of Scots:** Facing beheading with regal composure.
*   **The Unnamed Man:** Joking about his hair as the axe falls, showing mastery over fear.
*   **Moral:** If you can face your own death with a noble, unvictimized attitude, you can handle anything. This contrasts with "surrender" as a victim mentality.

### 7. **The Musician with an Assignment**
A real-life example from a prior conversation.
*   A music student is "surrendering" to the teacher's expectations, causing writer's block and worry.
*   The solution is to **stop surrendering** and instead write a piece **he enjoys**—shifting from a passive, pressured mindset to an active, joyful one.

### 8. **Monks Who Ruined Their Knees**
A cautionary tale within the community.
*   Several Western monks (Bhante Palo, Vela Maramsi, Subbato) are cited as examples of those who **forced themselves** to sit in painful postures to meet perceived expectations.
*   This "surrender" to a rule or ideal led to injury, isolation from the Sangha, and undermined their practice. It illustrates the danger of not listening to the body and pushing beyond wise limits.

### 9. **The Lion vs. The Wimp**
A character metaphor for the desired attitude.
*   The Buddha is likened to a **lion**—strong, fearless, a winner.
*   Surrender is likened to being a **wimp** or a victim.
*   The practice is about developing the "lion's" confidence: "I can do this."

### 10. **Angulimala's "Stop"**
A reference to a famous Buddhist sutta.
*   The Buddha tells the murderer Angulimala, "I have stopped. You stop." This is used to encapsulate the entire teaching: the active, decisive moment of **stopping** unwholesome thoughts and actions right in their tracks.

**Overall Theme of the Metaphors:** The speaker consistently uses metaphors that contrast **passive, victim-based responses** (stepping in dung, surrendering, being forced) with **active, skillful, and often joyful agency** (stepping aside, flicking away, training with enjoyment, choosing satisfaction). The goal is to replace a mentality of surrender with one of confident, present-moment mastery.
