### Transcript


**Speaker A:** uncaring and selfish environment, I can be completely the opposite of that. I totally have the free will to do that, you know. And I think that can be a really kind of nice realization.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah,

**Speaker C:** yeah.

**Speaker B:** I remember Alan Watts saying once that his bringing back the teachings from the East was not an attempt to convert anyone, but rather he said that until you've compared your view with another, how do you even know that you agree with it, right? It's just how things are. Let's at least consider an alternative and then say, no, I'm going to stick to my guns. I like the Judeo-Christian thing. I'm gonna stick with it.

**Speaker D:** That's very literal if you're an American.

**Speaker E:** And even in that, like, no matter

**Speaker C:** what you're mentioning, Christianism, like, right here in Mexico, the view of Buddhism is like literally going to the forest, like, live there. Like, that's what people think Buddhism is.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** It's really quite crazy how, like, not even like, yeah, I understand the view, but they understand it from ignorance. Like, they don't completely go in. Like, they just superficially go like, yeah, Buddha did this. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or perhaps even do some basic discernment or investigation.

**Speaker C:** Precisely.

**Speaker B:** I recall a time right before I left for Thailand to go on retreat, my parents chose dinner the night before my departure to tell me that they were scared that I was off to join a cult. So I enjoyed working through that one on the plane ride. And the retreat and a couple months afterward. Because people don't, people don't tend to do the kind of investigation that we're interested in, which to us at some point just begins to look like a basic checking something out. Just find out, hey, what's it about? What's it about? Let me not just draw my own conclusions. Let me go Google. Now there's a generational thing in that, I think, as well, largely. The amount of times I've told my mother, she'll come to me with some question about how to do something on her computer, and I'll say, Mum, go to the computer, type into the computer what you just said to me, and there's your answer. Way better than I could give it to you. Right? So there's a generational thing there, I think, a lot of times.

**Speaker F:** What I also enjoy about this issue of experiencing different cultures and a bit in conjunction or putting together what Joe earlier said was that when you experience another culture and another language and stuff, You can so easily see how absolutely arbitrary all that stuff is, and that's what I really enjoyed when I saw it for the first time. I really liked that. It was really—

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just to see, hey, look, I'm surrounded by thousands of people all doing things opposite to the way that I've been doing them my entire life. How cool is this? Yeah, many benefits to travel.

**Speaker C:** So I got here while Joe was talking about impermanence, I would think, like I dare to say, like things changing and stuff. Like, that's when I entered the call, and I love that talk because while reading about Tibetan Buddhist teaching, the first thing that you practice is detachment, unattachment, and Well, we can actually attach to something. We can actually grab something that we know for certain. The only thing that we know for certain is going to happen. And that's impermanence. That's real. That blows my mind. To phrase it, it says we spend our whole lives learning how to live. Well, when the time comes to die and you really didn't learn to live, but you didn't either learn to die. So like, why don't we learn to die? Because that's the only thing that we can actually prepare for. Like, that's for certain. Like, I'm gonna die. And well, let's get ready for it, man. Like, I love that work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And it gets— it's trippy already. It gets even trippier when you start to look at, well, hey, I'm kind of dying in every moment.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and you are already, in a way, you're already dead because that's the only certain thing, as Rula said. You are going to die. That means it practically has happened, and yet we're sitting here talking to each other.

**Speaker B:** Well, and so then you get into who do you mean when you say who.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, you're neither dead nor alive, right?

**Speaker B:** It all gets very, very trippy, especially when this stuff moves from the intellectual to the experience. Yeah, very cool.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I love that from Dhammarato.

**Speaker F:** Oh yeah, I actually had a moment on my walk today where just for a split second or some, so I was completely sober and I felt like I was tripping balls, man.

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker E:** I love when that happens. I was at work the other day, and it was like the whole time I was on no drugs, just like tripping like fucking crazy. Like I was thinking about dependent origination and all kinds of shit, like explosions happening in my mind while I'm like pushing a dust mop in a hardware store.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Because why not?

**Speaker C:** I'm sorry, who spoke? Like, I didn't see anyone talking.

**Speaker E:** I think you can— it was me, Brandon.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so on my screen, Rulas, I have some extra circles for folks who are just joining us on audio.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I just thought like, it was like, wow, no one's moving.

**Speaker E:** Me too.

**Speaker D:** That's where this group has progressed, just straight telepathy.

**Speaker G:** Hey, I had a question.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, Alex.

**Speaker G:** So, I mean, I'm pretty fascinated by all those experiences too. Like, that was me yesterday. Tripping balls just walking outside. And it was after a meditation practice of noticing everything in my experience as object. And I know, Dan, you and I talked, and we basically had decided that it's important to not get attached to those kinds of experiences also. But it also sounds like, I guess how I heard that is that it's not any phenomena, because right, if you see it, it's phenomena. So how I heard that is that it's to be weary of, or to

**Speaker B:** be— to be enjoyed.

**Speaker G:** To be enjoyed.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, like everything else, attached to non-attachment either. It's a really tricky thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's no rule regarding how phenomena should be regarded. The, and the whole teaching is in the not being attached. That's all we need to watch for. We want to not make anything of those experiences. We certainly want to avoid the trap of trying to repeat them, right? Thinking that they meant this. They're impermanent too.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, it just goes and it comes and goes. And yeah, you can't— yeah, exactly, the non-attachment to that, you know, experience.

**Speaker G:** Well, you say how Well, they're impermanent, right? And we don't want to get attached to them, right? But at the same time, Dan, you said that it gets really trippy when it goes into the experiential level.

**Speaker B:** It can.

**Speaker G:** So which is what happened for me yesterday. So when you're in that experiential level of integrating some of these experiences, is it ever the case that some of these experiences don't actually, like, are not impermanent? Is there an aspect to the experiential aspect of going into these experiences that become, that more just become a part of your natural experience?

**Speaker B:** Well, I think Brandon might have an answer for you that he shared earlier on.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** In the form of a question. Do you remember?

**Speaker E:** Well, basically, Basically, yeah, it's like ask yourself if impermanence is impermanent and then follow your mind down that rabbit hole for 7 hours and you'll get nowhere.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking of a simple question that you asked Brandon, which was just show me something that's permanent. That was how you phrased it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's the same exact thing. It's the same exact thing however way you say it. Say it. You're just chasing a carrot at that point.

**Speaker F:** And Alex, I mean, you just asked about something on the experiential level that becomes permanent. So that even already kind of answers itself, because even if it were that something changed that you you maybe could carry with yourself to your grave, then even if that were the case, it started at some point and there was a before. So even that is not technically permanent, even if you were to experience it like that for the rest of your life.

**Speaker G:** Then what is the point? And then like talking about the experiential aspect of these conditions, if we're meant to just let them pass away. It seems as though there's just as much a revere for these experiential insights as there is for letting them go and not being attached for them.

**Speaker H:** I think that you can understand it in the sense of you can examine the experience and investigate the experience to see what could be learned from the experience in terms of maybe matching concepts with your experience. But beyond that, holding on to that experience is something you want in the future of a certain state that you want or a certain experience. Is, is that's when it gets into the unwholesome. Doing the investigation there and then letting that be what it was and moving on.

**Speaker E:** As a general rule, if you get attached to something awesome, it kind of reduces the chance that you're actually going to have it in the future as easily.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I've noticed that for sure.

**Speaker B:** Right, but, and so that's not to say that we can't experience it as awesome.

**Speaker E:** Exactly, yeah, there's no problem with that.

**Speaker B:** Right, you hear that, Alex?

**Speaker E:** Anicca is awesome, it's fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so we can enjoy the show. In fact, that's recommended. And it's then about investigating that subtle difference between enjoying the hell out of it and being attached to it. Of course, the way we're trained, those two very often come together.

**Speaker I:** I guess it's almost automatic.

**Speaker D:** It's socially, culturally, biologically, it's almost an automatic grab, hold on to. And then of course, in certain religious schools, one would even attribute a lot of meaning, like extra meaning to it as well, which is really just a distraction. All that meaning that's been hung onto it, like it's decoration. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker G:** I guess I'm a little stuck because—

**Speaker E:** In a lot of ways, the meaning isn't separate from the experience though, too. It creates part of what the experience is. It's a really tricky thing, but there is benefit in not trying to attach a bunch of extraneous meaning if you can help it.

**Speaker D:** Well, the meaning is illusory anyway, right? The meaning is that ego-generated and then is interpreted often through that lens of culture and or even other religions that someone may have been exposed to.

**Speaker I:** So yeah.

**Speaker F:** One other rather practical thing is also because you asked the question of why are we even talking about it? That's one way of getting it out of your system, so to say. There, I mean, I mean, you know, there's some, some things where you're just like, man, I gotta tell someone about this shit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker D:** It's a social connection that we are often driven to, to experience as well. And this in itself could be seen as a pleasant experience that not too much should be attached to either,

**Speaker E:** right?

**Speaker D:** Every moment is that chance.

**Speaker G:** But there must be an abiding experiential experience to having fully accepted oneself, having fully loved your dark sides.

**Speaker B:** Subtractive.

**Speaker G:** Yes, yes, subtractive, right. But what I'm saying is, in that subtraction, there has got to be— I'm not got to be, but I'm— even in my own experience, there's more relief, there's more ease in my day-to-day now than there was years ago.

**Speaker B:** And that's the absence of things, right, rather than an addition of things.

**Speaker I:** Right.

**Speaker D:** Ah, math.

**Speaker G:** I think what I'm getting at is that, like, my argument is that there is an actual experience that lingers in the absence of all of those things that we're letting go of.

**Speaker I:** You kind of have new habits, right? You're giving up the old habits for a new habit, and the new habit is gives you a different experience of the world. So, right, if that's what, if that's what you mean by, you know, hanging around, I think that would make sense, right? Because unless you get rid of that habit, it's going to continue, right?

**Speaker H:** And part of this habit could be freedom from the hindrances that had you wanting states or going between states, or like Dan is saying, freedom from the things that we're trying to add but but now you can just let go.

**Speaker G:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, and yeah, that is, I guess, a state you could call it is quite secluded from hindrances, is absence of hindrances.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I mean, like, by comparison, that has got to be like absolute, I don't know, freedom. It's got to be absolute relief.

**Speaker B:** That's got to be— yeah, relief is a great word. Relief is a great word.

**Speaker G:** That's got to be something. Experiential.

**Speaker B:** So, yeah.

**Speaker G:** And I mean, Doug, to your point, yeah, I think that's, that is why we talk about it, to get it out of our system. But I think another big part of it is because we all want that relief, we all want that freedom. And it's, we're gonna keep wanting that freedom, even in practicing not wanting.

**Speaker B:** Well, and Dhammarato would tell you that that's a wholesome thing to want. If we're going to want anything, let's want freedom.

**Speaker G:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker F:** I can totally get you, Alex. I think because I'm also in, at least in my mind, it's also like, at least the way that those, those who have walked before us and that we listen to talk, it, it at least suggests that there is some kind of significant difference in experience. And I mean, to a certain degree, we can also verify that already for ourselves. And yet, nothing in a way really changes. I couldn't answer this myself.

**Speaker B:** Because we're moving— Yeah, by a process of subtraction, we're moving toward the ordinary.

**Speaker I:** Dan and Rick, is it Rick? You brought up about the meaning, and it's good that I forgot who said that exactly, but you commented on it. But I think as a human, I mean, we naturally do meaning. And if you're going to brighten the mind, like Dhammarato says you have to change the meaning of the actual inputs you have, correct? I mean, so how do you eliminate that and still have good results, I guess, with, you know, because the brightening of the mind involves changing the meaning of how you're looking at whatever the situation is at that moment.

**Speaker B:** If we were to exchange the word meaning for view, would that be comfortable for you, Christopher?

**Speaker I:** Yeah, but it's almost like a synonym at that point.

**Speaker B:** It could be. And yeah, I mean, clearly we're in semantics here, right? The reason I suggest view is because it's on that list of 8. And where meaning has that quality of it being something fabricated. View. Right? Has that more— we're talking about perspective, a way of seeing things.

**Speaker I:** Well, that is something that Dhammarato brought up that it's like a subtle point. I think for most people it was for me, but really important is that, you know, when he talks about, you know, I think he's had several comments and a lot of the things I've listened to about positive thinking, and most people take that as, okay, I am feeling wonderful today, or tomorrow I'm going to do this. But his whole thing is to take what's happening right this second and sort of reframe it or add meaning to the thing happening right now. It's not something in the future, it's not something in the past. You're not reworking stuff, you're dealing with this moment, which kind of lit a light bulb in my head.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and a whole other side of what we're doing here is we're kind of open sourcing our investigations. Right, so that Alex, you bring this big juicy question and we all chew on it for a while together. It's wonderful.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, I have a question. You know, we're talking about grasping or trying to hold on to these experiences, and that made me think of the Jhanas. I think I was listening to Robert You did a talk with Dhammarato about Jhana, I think, just recently. So one thing I noticed that Dhammarato says is that, you know, he says, well, you've been in and out of the Jhanas while I've been talking to you. But then when I read about Jhanas, like the first, or at least first Jhana, not multiple Jhanas, but the first Jhana, he says you've been in and out of first Jhana. But when I read about the first Jhana in a lot of books, it seems like that's a pretty intense experience, like a Kundalini type of thing. And I can tell you I have not had that. So I was wondering what comments people have on that.

**Speaker J:** Well, Daniel Ingram, in a book called Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, introduces the concept of light and hard Jhana. So he says you can have like a very mild version of the Jhana, just sort of coloring your view the way you perceive. And then you can have like the full thing, which he calls a hard Jhana. And then that would be like the more, um, Paññā, I think, is like definition of Jhana, which would, which is like the really, like, it's, it's very, um, it's very strict and probably similar to what you were reading. And that, that's like, yeah, sort of a difficult, difficult state to get into. It takes more skill than the light Jhanas.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I do agree with what Dhammarato says, that the at least, you know, early, like, smaller kind of blips of Jhana are here because Jhana are just ways of, I mean, perceiving in a sense. They're just a loss of certain fabrications that, you know, we like to think are important or like fun to see happen or feel significant or have meaning behind them. I mean, like, you're just dropping away fabrication until you get to Nirodha Samadhi. And, you know, at that point, you know, you got there, whatever. But all along the way, like, you're running into these different perceptual abilities. Like, you can, you know, sometimes focus with your vision, and if you focus long enough on one thing, you can notice it go from, you know, I'm looking at the thing, then it's like almost like I'm connected to the thing. Like, the focus is really easy. And then you go to 2, and then it gets to have like the nice Kundalini type stuff that one person mentioned just a minute ago. Like, you might have stronger energies. It's kind of like the arising and passing away stuff on the insight stages is kind of— it's a rough way to think about it, but these don't always happen when you're like in every meditation necessarily, even for people who are amazing. If you're just doing it short a short, like if you focus on the corner of your laptop screen for 5 minutes, you're probably gonna, for a blip of time at some point, be in some of the jhanas. But this is so unnoticeable to the mind that hasn't already seen like the big macro version of it that shows some more of the flavors to it and how it works. There are people who can— go from like boundless space to boundless consciousness in a sort of, in a way with eyes open. There are even people who claim this. And, you know, Daniel Ingram also talks about it too. But like you can have aspects of the Jhana there. I see someone raised a question.

**Speaker A:** No, no, you can, you can continue. Just sometimes people put their hands up just to keep, keep going.

**Speaker E:** Okay, I didn't know that was a keep going. Sorry. Basically, the idea is, you know,

**Speaker B:** even

**Speaker E:** in the visual field, you can be in certain jhanas, and people even claim that there are formless jhanas. It can be so— some, in a certain way, experience— like, you can feel the boundless space aspect of the actual Jhana, like in its full form, like Rob was talking about. But you can feel that space completely. You know, you're all space, quote unquote. You can feel that even when you're living your daily life. And you could even switch to like boundless consciousness in a certain sense, not like a complete full way, but completely. Basically, it's a really easy way to just— you extend your sense of self to everything. Even if there's a trash can in front of you, you could, you know, everything might have that feeling of consciousness. I am this, I am that. It's almost related to like some of the people who do a bunch of psychedelics talk about like God consciousness and things like that. I mean, when you feel consciousness, feel to be everywhere, it's a oneness type experience feeling. So I don't know. I'm talking for a long time.

**Speaker B:** So I'll let other people ask questions. No, this is all great, Brandon, to explain just a little further what the raised hand thing tends to mean in our little group here is just who wants to go next. Kind of click the little button, right? So if you have more, please continue.

**Speaker E:** Oh, I mean, I have more. Nobody has anything else to say. I'm used to talking for a long time about this stuff. You can ask Rob.

**Speaker J:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** But yeah, there are all of these different qualities. The Jhana, the way I see it, is it's like some certain way that humans perceive things, and it's a good path for them to go to places of less fabrication, or what feels like it. What about an alien that has completely different neurochemistry and you know, is made from some combination of elements we don't even have an idea would, um, you know, function like us, you know. Do they experience the same jhanas? I don't know if we can really say that.

**Speaker B:** Well, and indeed, between one human and the next, can we really ever confirm, right? Unless we get tons of people under MRI.

**Speaker E:** There are some people who say you can't confirm that the other people have even consciousness, and it's like there's there isn't much you can really confirm 100% in this life. I'm sorry, guys. But it's all the more fun that way sometimes.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker F:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, Joe.

**Speaker A:** I felt like Christopher tried to jump in a few times. Do you want to go ahead, Christopher? This is your question.

**Speaker I:** I was just going to ask, so are the experiences a key to the path or are they irrelevant? So for example, there's all kinds of hypnotic phenomenon, like I can make you raise your arm or not feel things or whatever, but that's not critical to hypnosis. It's just phenomenon that happens, you know. You know, these things actually happen when you're doing hypnosis. So is this— these, these, uh, states, uh, I guess, that happen, are they part of the past? Because it seems to me when I read about it, it's like, okay, when you do this, it's almost like a guidepost. This was going to happen in the first Jhana. I'm going to have this. I've even read where people have this intense feeling that's uncomfortable for like 5 months or whatever. I've even read it about people that weren't in Buddhism, like with the guy that did the Sedona Method, the guy who originated that. He went through a thing where he felt so much bliss or whatever for like 4 or 5 months that it got annoying. You know, and I think Dhammarato's spoken about that too, where you feel so good so long, you're like, okay, I've had enough of this, and then you go to the next level. But, but, um, so is that like a signpost, or is that where you're actually looking?

**Speaker E:** Release attachment, in my opinion, is once you've had enough of your cake, you kind of want to go take a sip of milk or something. Like, you, you get to where it's like more normalized, and then it does lead to a path of going to like being so let go of things to where the process can kind of naturally unfold more. It's not necessarily that there's a doer doing all this either. Some, a lot of people claim, and that's murky territory to say whether there is or not, in my opinion. Even having many of those type experiences, I could even, you know, look at my hand right now and you know, there would be an element of feeling that, but I don't know if that answered things clearly.

**Speaker B:** This is all great for where I'm sitting. Joe, do you mind if I just add something?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Which is just that I think it's important for us to remember that there are so many interpretations out there, and we can pick up one book by a teacher who's highly respected and revered in one tradition tradition, and they will have one interpretation of Jhana. And then another book from another teacher who's highly respected and revered in another tradition, maybe even two teachers from the same tradition. You know, we're gonna find differences in Ajahn Chah to Ajahn Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Um, and when we consider the infinite variables that are possible within the mind It's no small wonder when we also consider that we're in the realm of words here, then it's gonna be really difficult to finally pin down. We're certainly never going to get everyone to agree on exactly what Jhana is— 1, 2, 3, or 4, or some people go up to 8. I like Dhammarato's representation of the whole thing, which is where he refers to that sutta where the Buddha recalled sitting under the rose apple tree as a youngster and recalling that first Jhana is adequate for the investigation that's necessary for awakening. That's been the tidiest explanation that I've found, but Joe, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I would agree with that, but I really am drawn to Thai forest tradition in general, so yeah, it's not just Dhammarato, that's kind of a general sort of thing there. Ajahn Brahm has the same thing, he has a good explanation there, but I wanted to kind of get to what Christopher asked about it being, are they like signposts? And I think I think no would be my answer, that they're not really signposts of anything. It's just another opportunity to investigate when they do arise, when these experiences do arise, but it's not a like, hey, I've made it to this point, it means anything, you know, because if you don't take that investigative ability that extra perceptual ability that comes as a result of the jhanas and use it for something wholesome, then it's kind of pointless. As Brandon was mentioning, you can stare at a corner in the computer and you'll probably have moments of first jhana, but like, what are you going to do with that? And then just the other quick thing I wanted to mention, if you're interested in like how to actually do it though, and you are still a little bit attached to the world and you're like, hey, I just really want to do this, the book Right Concentration by Leigh Brazington is like the best guide that I've ever seen after like years of trying other stuff. That book is just awesome at laying out like a practical sort of like, hey, this is how you're going to do it.

**Speaker I:** I think that's where I saw the exclamation. I think that's where I saw that exclamation.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker E:** Oh, about it's called The Right Concentration, is that right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the book is called Right Concentration: A Practical Guide to the Jhanas by Leigh Brazington.

**Speaker I:** Okay, I didn't finish the whole book because I didn't get past that first part there, but it seems pretty comprehensive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think it's good to just stop because like, I mean, it's just like curiosity. I mean, I have not gotten anywhere like deeper. And I'm just— it's just sort of like spiritual masturbation to read about like the sixth jhana for me. Like, it's just pointless, you know?

**Speaker F:** But it feels good.

**Speaker E:** Are you saying that because it's like become normal, or because like— no, because

**Speaker A:** I haven't come anywhere.

**Speaker E:** You haven't gotten it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because I haven't been anywhere close to it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I, I read about that freaky when life is like that. All the time in a sense. Like, you don't know. It's weird. It's really weird.

**Speaker B:** Rick, what was weird about it?

**Speaker A:** Raise your hand next.

**Speaker E:** Well, I mean, if you just imagine, like, going from, like, when you're a kid and you feel like you're in this collapsed ego, like, let's say around, like, 12 years old or something, you don't know about this stuff. Most people, maybe some really gifted people are just lucky. I don't know how you want to say it. Like someone who's going to become an actual master one day, like maybe, I don't know, they might have it. But every one of us probably had a time for a long time that we just felt like collapsed in the ego. And then slowly as you go on the spiritual path, like you notice more things, like it changes the way that your life goes. And it's just another jump, like changing you to be able to perceive more. It's not that anything new was necessarily added. It's that you're just noticing aspects that were there, or at least that's how experience at least shows what it's doing or how we interpret it. So we just go off of what we've experienced and that's our best shot. As we see more things, we assume that it must have been there, like it's in our memories, that it was there. We didn't experience it, but it seems to apply to everything now. So I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, that doesn't sound weird to me, but I wonder if you're speaking about a weirdness as a bridge, because it sounds as though what you're describing is ending up in that ordinariness. Does that sound accurate?

**Speaker E:** Oh, like it's not a gigantic special thing anymore? Is that what you mean? Like it's

**Speaker A:** an ordinary thing, or?

**Speaker B:** What you described didn't sound weird to me.

**Speaker E:** No, I don't. Oh yeah, well, that's good then, I guess. It just, to me, it's a bit weird sometimes. Just to know that, you know, such a big thing like seemed to always be under your nose the whole time and then you're like, oh.

**Speaker C:** Right, uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I hear that. That kind of hidden in plain sight kind of quality.

**Speaker J:** Um, I have a question regarding this sort of concept of awakening being hidden in plain sight. Do you think there's a lot of merit to not exerting very much effort at all to be mindful and to investigate and sort of try to exert the minimum effort we can while still like trying to like notice this thing, just because like if it's, if it's so, if it's so obvious, we should, we shouldn't have to exert effort. And I've heard Rupert Spira say like exert no effort, just be it. And that was meditation that last night, and it was, it was good. Like it gladdened my mind because I, I guess I had a lot of faith in what he was saying, and so it made me feel happy, but I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we each, we each have to play with this, and it's kind of like a balancing— not too tight, not too loose— as the Buddhist teaching on right effort, right?

**Speaker F:** And sometimes it depends how much and how much shit you have piled up on it during the course of your life, and how— what a bit like what the quality of that stuff is. It can— I think it could be that it's a lot harder for some and a lot easier for others to just be like, oh wait, what?

**Speaker J:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker H:** You could also say that we have these habit patterns built up and the momentum is kind of heading that way. So whenever— so not doing anything, not having any effort at all, we'll probably just continue with those old habits. But we can just put in just enough right effort to change those habits and then be in that effortless state that you're talking about. And then when maybe something else arises, the old habits come again, we can change that again, use just enough right effort to not go by those old habits.

**Speaker J:** Right.

**Speaker D:** There's a bit of foundation building in the beginning, like with anything, right? There's got to be some foundation building. That, as always in the beginning, may feel like quite a bit of effort as we pull ourselves from those old patterns. And I feel like it's necessary for us to kind of not use the idea of little effort too much as an excuse to, as you said, Parker, not do anything. Right? It's sort of like we've got to get ourselves some inertia inertia with some effort, some effort, and then eventually maybe it will come along to, oh, this doesn't feel like effort at all. But before a foundation is built, you know, yeah, it's hard to drift into. It's not like you can drift into it. Yeah, accidentally got there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And here is the difficulty that's before the teacher who is addressing an audience. Because if that teacher prescribes one thing, and I would say that a recommendation to build a foundation would be a safer prescription than the recommendation to do nothing. If you tell someone who's suffering with addiction to do nothing, well, they might just end up killing themselves.

**Speaker J:** Good point.

**Speaker B:** Right. However, on the other hand, someone who perhaps has had little trauma in their past, who got a light brushing from the stick of conditioning, might just be able to go and listen to someone like Rupert and see what he's speaking about, and there might be an opportunity for them to see something. In that. So it's difficult for a teacher who's addressing an audience. Now, of course, Rupert is speaking within a very specific philosophy, the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta.

**Speaker J:** Yes, Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** A light brushing from the stick of conditioning, really.

**Speaker B:** Do you think anyone's gotten off that lightly?

**Speaker A:** Poetic, poetic.

**Speaker I:** No, no, but it's lovely. It's lovely.

**Speaker D:** It's worthy of airport sandwiches.

**Speaker H:** I think Dhammarato said he had the story of flicking a booger off. Oftentimes the booger is pretty sticky and you have to really flick it off.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker J:** Right.

**Speaker B:** I also heard him use the analogy of the clenched fist. Right, and he said the instruction to just let go, right, when you've got arthritic joints here that have been curled, or, you know, like when you get off the roller coaster and you've been gripping so tight that you can't open your hands up. When I used to play drums as a teenager, I would play so hard, I would get so overexcited that following the show I wouldn't be able to open my thumbs. Out away from my hands. So that's what happens when you grip tightly. And of course, when it comes to conditioning, we've been gripping tight for not a few hours but a few decades.

**Speaker J:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so what Dhammarato said is, you know, the instruction to let go sometimes just ain't enough, right?

**Speaker A:** It's oversimplistic.

**Speaker B:** Usually needed is more a prizing open of those fingers, or maybe a massaging Right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's up to each of us to like play with these things ourselves too. That's the whole thing, right? Is that like it's up to each of us to play with it, but it's also good to have friends around you who can be like, hey, I noticed that your practice is getting a little bit unbalanced in this way, because I've met a lot of yoga people who sort of are in this sort of do-nothing mentality, and they really do nothing in life. For a lot of years, you know, and it like, it's extremely unbalanced on that end. And then on the other end, I have other friends who do like noting practice, and they're wired like constantly. And you know, and you just, you see this and you notice it in yourself too, where you're like, I've noticed different parts of my practice where I'm like, oh, like if I try this sort of practice, it has this result. And if I try this, it sort of has this result.

**Speaker B:** You know, so that's the one.

**Speaker E:** My general take on it would be like, if you think do nothing feels better or sounds better, try it. Try doing nothing for a while. And if doing nothing ends up giving you nothing and no progress, maybe it's time to try something. And then when you're trying something forever, if it's not doing nothing, If it's not progressing you, you know, try switching your approach. You can't really be fixed with a lot of these things. You have to be kind of adaptable, like a kung fu of consciousness or something. You're like dancing around with all this stuff in your consciousness at the same time. It's not easy to grasp it. And the rules of the game kind of switch up on you. As your life goes on, you know, different psychological things come up or a hard experience and you're like, wow, maybe I wasn't as, you know, advanced on this as I thought, or maybe there's something I was really missing, you know, who knows what's going to happen. So you've got to just be adaptable and try to find what works and, you know, pay attention, maybe even track what your progress in like a journal and you can see if, hey, maybe I'm making a mistake in the way I'm viewing things and doing my practice.

**Speaker A:** And what worked in the past is not necessarily going to always work in the future is another aspect of that, because you can really get stuck in that of like, hey, but this used to work for me at this point in time, you know, and Yeah, and

**Speaker B:** there's a unique predicament among our generation of practitioners, which is the sheer number of teachings and practices to which we have access. And each and every one of these teachings says this is the teaching. Yeah, well, which The One is the The One?

**Speaker D:** There's too many The Ones. There's too many The Ones.

**Speaker B:** Now I considered at some point regarding all of this, well, hold on a minute, and I feel I've probably shared this with at least one of you before. Hold on a minute, these teachings were probably given in climates where people were still sacrificing goats. So someone rolls in with the Dharma and says, stop, this is the way. But now we've got the way from Tibet and the way from Japan and the way from Thailand, the way from anywhere else who wants to throw their hat in the ring.

**Speaker J:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What we have to do is to see the fingers pointing at the moon. Okay, they're pointing from different places, but that's the commonality among these teachings.

**Speaker E:** Where do they agree?

**Speaker B:** How is it that the Dalai Lama and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa sat, Tathagata, all smiles, loving it. Well, it's because they agree. So although downstream we might see differences in these teachings, upstream they're all pointing at that moon.

**Speaker F:** Then I wanted to, uh, add on something before I go. To what metaphor of the clenched fist that you just, that you gave a while back. I really like that because as everybody knows, when you've had Anagami for a while, that gave you this kind of cramps. Of course, when you, even when you relax again, it'll hurt. At least that's how I experience it at my mosque when I want

**Speaker B:** Sorry, Doug, someone's got some TV sound going on in the background. Thanks. Go ahead, Doug.

**Speaker F:** So that when you have had a cramp and even if you try to release the muscles again, that they still go on hurting for a while still. And I really like that because that's been my experience with like this fist open, isn't necessarily a pleasant thing. It can, in some points it can be like, oh, that's releasing, but often it can be that it really hurts, at least at first.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it also may feel very unusual. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that really describes a lot of your experience, Dark.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and I'm sure that I'm not alone in this. But anyway, I gotta head off. It was really cool seeing all you guys. Brandon, cool that you joined for the first time, and have a good time.

**Speaker J:** Nice talking.

**Speaker B:** Great to see you, Dhammarato. Bye-bye. Now Robert up top has a hand up.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, I actually forgot during that what I was actually gonna say.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's how it goes sometimes. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's all this kind of open source goodness, right? Kind of like a shared train of thought.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, really wonderful stuff.

**Speaker A:** You know what, one thing that I wonder is like You know, it tends to be in our group that we're all kind of like the same sort of age range, very like male. Like, I wonder— Very male. Yeah. I wonder if it like leads us to like certain just general things like topics that we talk about or ways of being or like, I don't know, what are our blind spots that happen because of this? I'm just curious if anybody— Maybe Olivia could tell us.

**Speaker B:** Oh, she's not here.

**Speaker I:** I'm just happy you said we're all in the same age group. I'm happy with that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, the real truth is no age.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Debbie also comes in sometimes, of course. She's sat here by me right now, exhausted after a long day's work. No energy to tell us all of our shortcomings. Hooray!

**Speaker D:** I think it's one of those things where, because the group is like, the ebb and flow is a bit dynamic, we'll just have to accept whatever perspectives happen to come in at this particular time. Yeah, of course there's going to be blind spots, you know, based on culture, gender, etc. But again, it's good for us also to just appreciate the perspectives, whether they're very male or not, and just say, "Okay, this is what we're working with. These are the tools we happen to have today." That's why I see it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and a lot of our conversation, as I think you were perhaps touching upon, Brandon, is that we're really going upstream with a lot of this stuff to where, yes, if we talk on the level of our conditioning, our history, there's certain relative truths. But when we get deep into that Dharma, not sure it really matters all that much.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like we talked early about the cultural barriers that We think we know the truth and then we know someone that's living a completely other truth and they're even happier and it's like, wow, so crazy. Like, so like a male, I sometimes meet people, meet women, meet trans women and I'm like, wow, it's like really, it's really a 180, sometimes 360 that I get all dizzy. Like it's really. Like a whole new perspective. But until we meet that, until we have that moment, that instant of where our perspectives meet, like, that's when we can get the best out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, like, don't get me wrong, like, I, I think it's— I think it could be helpful too, because like, obviously the truth or the Dhamma is like a shifting target, right? It's like right now, and it's right now again. So yeah, you know, that's the hard thing with searching for truth, is that you're like, there's no fixed truth because it's continuously happening again now, you know.

**Speaker B:** So which is why the only thing to do in the end is to call off the search.

**Speaker E:** It's absolutely crazy. I mean, there was one night I found myself in some ridiculously high conscious Anagami state, and I was imagining what it'd be like to be, you know, a Buddha cockroach and try to communicate the Dharma to cockroaches with no tools other than cockroach communication that they naturally have. Like, that's kind of like— imagine what an alien race sees us as. Maybe that's the level of, like, immaturity they might see us having and able— and the ability to perceive the Dharma. We don't know.

**Speaker D:** They definitely roll the windows up when they fly by.

**Speaker B:** Look at these Anagami dudes.

**Speaker D:** They definitely roll the windows up and lock the doors as they fly by. There's no question.

**Speaker I:** I don't want to go to Earth. I don't even want to go by Earth.

**Speaker E:** And with cockroaches, you don't lock your doors because you're afraid they're going to kill you. You lock their doors your doors because you're like, I don't even want to be around that. Like, who cares? It's a little nasty. Um, we'll just drive by. That's a funny concept.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Those anxious monkeys. Look at those anxious monkeys down there

**Speaker J:** blowing themselves up.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, we're anxious, anxious It's just monkeys.

**Speaker A:** You know, I have a question for you guys because I know that a lot of you talk to Dhammarato and I've seen like videos of you guys talking to him. Like sometimes I feel like I should talk to him, but I don't feel like I know what to ask or where to direct the conversation.

**Speaker J:** I've got the exact same thing.

**Speaker A:** And it's like I have this sort

**Speaker E:** of feeling from my meditation. I would just call him up and talk about whatever. It will be a positive experience unless you're like meditating in some hardcore retreat for 2 hours. I would say it's a pretty good way to use 2 hours of your time. And yeah, Dharma is going to end up coming up as a topic. So yeah, I would encourage anyone here, if you haven't talked to him, to at least try it out. I mean, I came from a completely different flavor of Buddhism. But, you know, one of Dhammarato's teachings really unlocked a lot of things for me and gave me a path to a lot of progress. Do I agree with everything he says? Not 100%, but I think he's a great teacher. I would definitely recommend, you know, he's a great resource. You literally have a master of Buddhism out there who's gonna talk to you for free. Yeah, that's a pretty valuable thing. Imagine, you know, what think of all the people who were, you know, spiritual seekers for thousands of years who, you know, there was no one around, and you've got someone on the internet who will talk to you for free. Like, take advantage of that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I like— I definitely— I don't think it's preventing me from calling him. It's just more I want to— I want to take advantage of that time because I like— I feel like it's so precious, the time that I have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And yeah, of Of course, of course. But I would say just do some journaling or something. And if any questions come up during your normal day that seem Dharma-related, you could make a little list and then pick some of the good ones and go into it with that. Just do a little tracking of what your day's like. I mean, I'm sure some part of the Dharma is going to come into your daily life and you'll at least be a little curious. It might not be the top of top things, but if you track it long enough, I'm sure you'll run into some of them. You know, you pay attention.

**Speaker B:** Alternatively, he'll love it if you just call him up and smile at him.

**Speaker E:** Exactly, that's why I was saying you just call. Like, I wouldn't worry too much.

**Speaker I:** He'll go with his topic.

**Speaker E:** Make up the questions on your next call, or go with whatever he wants to talk about. He's going to talk about the Dharma if you're not saying anything, probably, unless you just all are silently smiling for an hour straight, which he seems to like talking from what I've seen.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sometimes I feel like I can't get a word in. Yeah, so sometimes I like, I wait for him to take a drink of water so that way I can like get a word in.

**Speaker J:** Thank you for asking that, Joe. I had a similar question.

**Speaker E:** That's a good question.

**Speaker J:** I don't have any questions come up because the method seems so straightforward, right? It's like you just be happy now, you just and you just try to, you know, if you're resisting, like resistance, then you have to sort of like go Metta on it and sort of be clever. And it's this dynamic process, but at the same time I feel like it is quite straightforward. Like, so it's like sometimes, like I've been like, I haven't called him in like a week and a half because I just haven't known what to ask since I last called.

**Speaker B:** Try the smiling thing.

**Speaker F:** 3 weeks.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, the last time I was like, it was a brief question I made, and it was really like 45 minutes to call, and it was like, wow, it's really like, wow, 45 minutes, and it was 2 weeks earlier, and like, I don't know, like, I can see like my practice is feeling good even from that because I don't, I don't have any questions from that doubt now that Brandon told, like, just talk to him. Like, I think that would be fun.

**Speaker I:** I, I sometimes don't call them. I haven't called them for like 3 or 4 weeks because it just seems synchronicity-wise, every video I listened to was answering the question I had. But I, uh, I— if I have a— a lot of times the questions you were asking Joe and Brandon mentioned it, I'll listen to something and then a question will pop up while I'm listening and I'll just jot that down for the next time I talk to him. But you know, it's like you said, Rulaz, the, you know, you could ask one question and that can go for an hour and 45 minutes. So I have a list of about 15 questions, but I mean, I know I'm not going to give them all in one shot. It's just you got to, you got to kind of ease them in. But you know, I, I listen to those recordings every morning when I walk dog. And it's— I mean, that's— it's such a great resource to have people that— it's— it's— think about 100 years ago or even 50 years ago, there's nothing like that. I mean, even people that did audio tapes or whatever, there's nothing where you're like hearing things where people are asking real questions and you're hearing real answers right there. I mean,

**Speaker A:** you would have had to ordain.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, travel to Thailand and ordain, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker I:** Or, or it would be like a tape seminar or something that somebody happened to like record board or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's incredible value. Yeah, yeah. And there's a kind of osmosis thing that occurs as well, right? And we're all getting a good taste of it right now. Just hanging out is enough.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I know Dhammarato loves it. Win-win.

**Speaker J:** Yeah. What do you guys do aside from like Dhammarato's technique? Because one of the questions that I had for him was, once I've brightened the mind and I'm, you know, like happy and awakened and stuff, like what do I do then? And he sort of said, well, you clearly haven't brightened the mind enough if you're still thinking about what do I do then. So like, right? But I was wondering if you guys do any other practices that maybe help you become better at brightening, or just any other approaches that you like to integrate? Because there is a wide world of practices, after all.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato would just say to you that to enjoy. Like, enjoy writing up, like, enjoy the experience of whatever is going on at the moment. Like you're meditating, well, enjoy meditation. Whatever you're doing, enjoy that. And like, this comes from the same attachment and desire of wanting something more. Like, yeah, I know I'm sitting here, but I want something more. Like, I want to feel like Christopher told us earlier. Like, I want to feel this Jhana, like, boom, exploding something inside.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Like, that still is a desire.

**Speaker E:** So like, just enjoy the moment.

**Speaker J:** It's like an enlightenment treadmill, but it's still like a treadmill, right? You just want the next biggest awakening.

**Speaker D:** So I take it, as you said, well, as I take it into whatever I've decided is a part of my daily routine, whether it's teaching or eating or whatever, and I I use it as sort of like back to view again, Dan. Like it's sort of a view. It's a view of seeing it.

**Speaker J:** And

**Speaker D:** yeah, I don't think about doing anything extra special. It's the super mundane, right? It's back to the super mundane. You continue to live your life, but now with this sort of gladness

**Speaker I:** Anapanasati,

**Speaker D:** or brightened mind, without these assumptions of, okay, I'm going into— I'm gonna call this student and, oh, okay, here's what I'm concerned about or worried about. No, it's like, okay, each time is like a new introduction. How are you doing today? What have you been doing today? And being very receptive receptive. And with that kind of super mundane, brightened up mind, you know, I'm able to listen very, very carefully to what they're saying because I'm not in the way anymore. Or if I'm eating lunch, you know, my expectations or other thoughts aren't intruding and I'm able to really enjoy whatever it is that I happen to be, you know, chewing on. I guess that's what my take on it is, is about how each of these mundane experiences become really enjoyable because of that, rather than it's like going, okay, where's the next planet I'm going to rocket to from this?

**Speaker I:** Gladden mind.

**Speaker D:** I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. And that's cool.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I was just going to say, like, just give my personal practice. What I'm working on, like, a lot for myself is loving-kindness practice, because I tend to be— I have an aversive sort of personality from training, and I think it's helpful. I think that it's been very helpful in my life. It's been really transformative doing the sort of loving-kindness practice. And then the other practice that I tend to do is exploring difficult emotions when I have this sort of mind state that he's talking about. If it feels really solid and like, I mean, it's not like I do this all the time, but like It can be useful if you have problems with anger or something like that, like whatever the emotion is that you struggle with, when you do get that sort of stability, sort of this Jhana bliss a little bit, to investigate.

**Speaker J:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** if there's a little bit of stability, I find that investigating that can be fine. And I don't think Dhammarato would have a problem with that because I think I asked him about this. And, uh, it— I mean, there's tons of sutras that talk about investigating the skandhas and seeing them as empty of self, you know. And, uh, shifting your investigation to the, uh, emotions, which tend to be a sticking point for a lot of people in the West, uh, can be helpful. I found in my own personal practice in sort of— I, I don't— like, I just— I don't know what it is, what's changed, but I just, I don't have explosive anger anymore. It just doesn't, um, anger's still there, but it's not explosive anymore, um, you know. And that's been really transformative. So I don't know exactly what it is that has shifted it, um, but yeah. And then when things just get too overwhelming and life is too much, then, uh, just the body, like, just coming back to investigating the body, and, uh, not just the external body but inside as well. So that's my practice right now.

**Speaker B:** That's cool.

**Speaker J:** That's, that's really similar to my approach actually. There was a question I asked Dhammarato once, which was, what do you think about like suppressing our emotions to feel good now versus like allowing negative emotions to be there but just like fully feeling into them? I think that sounds kind of like what you were describing with the investigating the negative mind state and sort of allowing yourself to feel that and feel the— like, for me, it's like anxiety sometimes comes up in my meditations, but I'll focus on it. And, um, and, um, in a way it's sort of like— I mean, I don't want to say anything's higher or lower, but sometimes it feels like kind of like a higher order of gladdening, where I'm not just blocking myself from feeling, you know, the negative thoughts, reframe it. I'm actually allowing myself to go deeply into it, and it's quite healing, I feel like, for me. And that sounds like what you were doing, or it sounds similar at least.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, embracing. Yeah, exactly like that. Embracing your emotions, you know. And I mean, this is— I come from like Plum Village tradition, and Thich Nhat Hanh loves talking about this, you know, and like embracing whatever your emotion is, just taking it in with loving kindness and allowing it to transform and seeing that transformation. And it's a beautiful process, you know. Every time it happens, it's like a miracle, you know. And it takes some right effort too. And this is a thing that can get lost with sort of the Vipassana sort of noting practice, I find, is that like it can be a little bit like you note that you're depressed and then you keep noting that you're depressed and you keep noting that you're depressed and you don't really— and you don't really change. I mean, I, I say this out of experience, I've done it, you know. And it, it does change eventually. There is that factor that if you do it for like 8 hours, it does change. But it's a little bit easier, and depending on your personality type, I think it's extremely beneficial. It's really transformed my life, honestly.

**Speaker J:** We have a really similar practice— the body scanning, the noting, the feeling the emotions, and then the Dhammarato thing. That's like my number one. That's like, you just listed like the top 4 practices I've done more than any others. And that was like your practices. It's just a coincidence.

**Speaker B:** Very cool.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, anyone else, or, or do you just do Dhammarato's stuff?

**Speaker B:** Well, I had a lot of fun at one point, uh, doing a little kind of, uh, Dharma tourism. After having spent a long, long time speaking with Dhammarato, I then on his encouragement, went and checked out some other teachings and read some cool stuff from Zen and from the Tibetan stuff, and just had this wonderful experience of seeing agreement everywhere, of, you know, cutting out the chaff or the cultural stuff, you know, the baggage, and just seeing, okay, yeah, there it is again, the finger pointing at the moon. His Here's the Dharma. Okay, there's all this stuff that's been going on for hundreds of years around it, the cultural stuff, you know. I mean, you look at the Tibetan stuff and there's all this deity stuff going on, and it's like, gee, I mean, do I have to bring that along for the ride? No. Yeah, yeah, it's just symbolic, right? And actually, what it's symbolic of is often wonderful and fascinating. So there's a lot of fun to be had, and it really felt like that, like Dharma tourism, like just going and seeing. We were talking about physical travel earlier

**Speaker C:** on,

**Speaker B:** kind of a similar flavor, experiencing these different teachings.

**Speaker J:** And do you know of anywhere like you can see like a long list of like I probably Wikipedia, to be honest. But, um, I was one— I've always been wondering if there's— if anyone's compiled like a Metta resource of like all the spiritual teachings just in one place so someone could really like survey the— because I'm always finding about new ones like, like just randomly, like that I'd never heard of.

**Speaker B:** I'll tell you where it's probably— yeah, I'll tell you where it's probably best for that is The stream entry subreddit.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, cool, cool.

**Speaker B:** Right, because people who find their way there tend to be dedicated practitioners. There's a good bullshit filter, and so you'll get a lot of practices in that melting pot, but they all tend to be worth their salt.

**Speaker J:** Very cool, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or at the very least, someone is in a process of investigation of about a given practice or teaching and is reporting on it. Oh, Dharma Seed. Yeah, yeah, I've never heard of that.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, very cool. Thanks, guys.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, good stuff, guys. Listen, I'm sure we could go on all night. I'm gonna go rest. Uh, of course, any of you who want to continue can continue. But for me, I'm ducking out and I'll see you all next week.

**Speaker C:** Thanks, man.

**Speaker E:** Really great to meet you.

**Speaker H:** This is really great.

### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the group, facilitated by Dhammarato and his students, engaged in a wide-ranging and deep discussion about core Buddhist principles and personal practice. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### Core Themes of the Discussion:

1.  **Freedom of Choice & Cultural Perspectives:** The talk began with the realization that one can choose to be kind and generous even in a selfish environment. This led to a discussion on the value of exposing oneself to different worldviews (like Buddhism in the West or Christianity in Mexico) to truly understand and appreciate one's own views. The group noted how Buddhism is often superficially misunderstood.

2.  **Impermanence (Anicca) and Death:** A major focus was the profound and "mind-blowing" truth of impermanence. The group discussed how death is the only certainty in life, and that learning to accept impermanence is a form of preparation for death. They explored the trippy, experiential understanding that we are "dying in every moment" and questioned the solidity of the self who is dying.

3.  **Experiential Insights & Non-Attachment:** Several participants shared moments of sudden, deep insight during ordinary life (e.g., at work or on a walk), where Dharma concepts like dependent origination became vivid experiences. The central warning was to **enjoy these states but not cling to them**. They are impermanent phenomena, and attachment to them or seeking to recreate them leads to suffering. The goal is investigation, not possession.

4.  **The Path as Subtraction, Not Addition:** The group clarified that progress on the path is felt as **relief and freedom**—the absence of hindrances, cravings, and old habit patterns—rather than the acquisition of special states. It's a process of "brightening the mind" by letting go, not adding new things to it.

5.  **Jhanas (Meditative Absorptions):** There was a detailed discussion on the nature of Jhanas. They distinguished between "light" or momentary Jhanas (which can occur briefly in daily life) and "hard" or deep, stabilized Jhanas. The consensus, echoing Dhammarato and the Thai Forest tradition, was that even the first Jhana provides enough stability and clarity for profound investigation toward awakening. The experiences themselves are less important than the investigative wisdom they enable.

6.  **Balancing Effort and Effortlessness:** The group discussed the paradox of practice: it requires initial effort to overcome ingrained habit patterns (like "prizing open a clenched fist"), but the ultimate state is one of ease and effortlessness. One must find a personal balance, adapting the approach as needed, and not use the idea of "no effort" as an excuse for inaction.

7.  **The Value of Community and Dialogue:** The participants highlighted the immense value of having a supportive Sangha (community) and access to a teacher like Dhammarato. The call itself was an example of "open-sourcing" investigation—chewing on juicy questions together. They encouraged each other to reach out to teachers without fear, even if just to connect.

8.  **Integrating Practice into Daily Life:** The discussion concluded with how to practice beyond formal meditation. The essential advice was to **bring a gladdened, bright mind to super-mundane activities**—listening, eating, working. Additional supportive practices mentioned included loving-kindness (Metta) and the mindful, compassionate investigation of difficult emotions when the mind is stable enough.

**Overall Tone:** The talk was exploratory, personal, and supportive. It moved from intellectual understanding to the celebration of direct experience, all while emphasizing the core Buddhist tenets of non-attachment, impermanence, and the cultivation of wisdom and happiness in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Uncaring/Unselfish Environment vs. Free Will:** Speaker A uses the contrast between an "uncaring and selfish environment" and the ability to be "completely the opposite" as a metaphor for the power of individual choice and agency within a broader, indifferent system.

2.  **Sticking to One's Guns:** Speaker B uses the phrase "stick to my guns" as a metaphor for consciously choosing to remain with a familiar belief system (like Judeo-Christianity) even after considering alternatives.

3.  **The Rabbit Hole:** Speaker E refers to following a line of questioning about impermanence "down that rabbit hole" as a metaphor for a confusing, endless, and potentially disorienting intellectual pursuit.

4.  **Spiritual Masturbation:** Speaker A uses "spiritual masturbation" as a metaphor for indulging in intellectual curiosity about advanced states (like high jhanas) without the practical experience or application, implying it is self-gratifying but ultimately unproductive.

5.  **Kung Fu of Consciousness:** Speaker E describes the need to be adaptable in practice as a "kung fu of consciousness," metaphorically comparing spiritual practice to a dynamic martial art that requires fluidity and responsiveness.

6.  **The Clenched Fist:** Speaker B (referencing Dhammarato) uses the "clenched fist" as a central metaphor for attachment, conditioning, and suffering. The instruction to "let go" is simple, but the process may require "prizing open" or "massaging" the fingers, representing the gradual and sometimes difficult work of undoing deep habits.

7.  **The Cramp (Extension of the Fist):** Speaker F extends the fist metaphor, comparing the release of deep conditioning to relaxing a muscle cramp. Even after letting go, there can be residual pain or unusual sensation, metaphorizing the ongoing discomfort that can accompany personal change.

8.  **Flicking a Booger:** Speaker H mentions Dhammarato's story of "flicking a booger off," where the booger's stickiness represents the tenacity of defilements or negative habits.

9.  **A Light Brushing from the Stick of Conditioning:** Speaker B poetically suggests that some people may have only received "a light brushing from the stick of conditioning," metaphorizing varying degrees of trauma or psychological burden that affect one's spiritual starting point.

10. **Dancing Around:** Speaker E describes dealing with consciousness as "dancing around with all this stuff," a metaphor for the nimble, non-rigid engagement required in practice.

11. **The Enlightenment Treadmill:** Speaker J uses the "enlightenment treadmill" as a metaphor for the endless, self-defeating pursuit of ever-bigger spiritual experiences or awakenings, where one is constantly running but not arriving.

12. **The Super Mundane:** Speaker D refers to life after a brightened mind as living in "the super mundane," a metaphor for finding profound depth, enjoyment, and presence in utterly ordinary, everyday activities.

13. **Dharma Tourism:** Speaker B describes exploring different spiritual traditions as "Dharma tourism," a metaphor for the enriching and perspective-broadening experience of visiting other teachings without necessarily adopting them fully.

14. **Fingers Pointing at the Moon:** This classic Buddhist metaphor is used by Speaker B to explain that the various teachings and traditions (the fingers) are all pointing toward the same essential truth or experience (the moon), despite their different origins and methods.

15. **The Car Locking Doors:** Speakers D and E humorously imagine aliens or higher beings looking at anxious humanity like "anxious monkeys" and "rolling the windows up" or "locking their doors" as they fly by Earth, a metaphor for how un-evolved or troublesome human behavior might appear from an advanced perspective.

16. **The Buddha Cockroach:** Speaker E imagines trying to teach the Dharma as a "Buddha cockroach" using only cockroach communication, a metaphor for the immense difficulty of transmitting profound truths across vast gaps in perception, understanding, or form.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Alan Watts's Mission:** Speaker B recounts Alan Watts saying his work was not to convert people to Eastern thought, but to provide an alternative view for comparison, so one could truly know *why* they agree with their own view.

2.  **Misconception of Buddhism in Mexico:** Speaker C shares a story about the common misconception in Mexico that Buddhism is literally about going to live in the forest, highlighting how spiritual traditions are often misunderstood superficially across cultures.

3.  **Parents' Fear of a Cult:** Speaker B tells a personal story about his parents, the night before he left for a retreat in Thailand, expressing their fear that he was joining a cult. This illustrates the gap in understanding and the lack of investigation common in the face of unfamiliar spiritual paths.

4.  **Teaching Mom to Google:** Speaker B shares an anecdote about telling his mother to type her computer questions into Google instead of asking him, using it as a metaphor for a generational difference in the instinct to investigate information independently.

5.  **Tripping Balls at Work:** Both Speaker F and Speaker E share brief personal anecdotes about having profound, psychedelic-like insights into concepts like dependent origination during completely ordinary, sober moments (on a walk, while pushing a mop at a hardware store). These stories exemplify how deep understanding can manifest experientially in daily life.

6.  **The Sedona Method Founder's Bliss:** Speaker I references a story about the founder of the Sedona Method experiencing an extended period of intense bliss that eventually became annoying, using it as an example of how even positive states can become burdensome if one becomes attached to them.

7.  **The Buddha Under the Rose Apple Tree:** Speaker B references the story of the Buddha, as a young man (Siddhartha), spontaneously entering the first jhana while sitting under a rose apple tree. This story is used to support the point that the first jhana is a natural, accessible state adequate for profound investigation.

8.  **The Drummer's Grip:** Speaker B shares a personal story from his teenage years about playing drums so hard that his hands would cramp and he couldn't open them after a show. This serves as a concrete, physical analogy for the "clenched fist" metaphor, showing how prolonged, forceful gripping (attachment) makes simple release (letting go) difficult.

This analysis shows the conversation is rich with figurative language and personal narratives, which the speakers use to illustrate abstract philosophical concepts, share their journeys, and make the teachings relatable.
