### Transcript


**Speaker A:** If I could practice more, then this would be less of the case.

**Speaker B:** All right. Do you recognize then that wishing you could practice more is an unwholesome thought?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I realize that.

**Speaker B:** All right. Wishing I could practice more, you can say, aha, I see that thought. And then say, 'And I'm practicing right now.' And I'm glad that I can see that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** You're still in the state of wanting a change rather than doing the change.

**Speaker A:** Hmm. Yes.

**Speaker B:** See how habit-bound we are? We're habit-bound into the negative. And wanting it to be better right bloody now. That's an old joke, by the way. The joke is, uh, Lord, oh please give me patience, I need patience, oh please give me patience right bloody now, give me patience.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so we always want results right now, and we're in a state of wanting. And all that's really needed is for you to recognize that and say, I can change right now. And then make the change. Aha, I'm glad I see that I wanted something. I wanted it to be faster, where in fact it's fast enough when I make the change. Now, Ivan, one thing is for sure, and that is that everybody does what you're talking about. Everybody does that. As soon as they recognize how to practice correctly, they wanted to have already in the past practiced correctly, so that practicing correctly now is easy. Yes, the answer to that is, it's time to practice now. You're like the violin player. Who goes on stage to play the violin concerto, and while he is messing it up and the audience is going, "Aww, boo, hiss," and all of that, and he has the thought, "I wish I had practiced." And the answer to that is, let's practice it right now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes. I was thinking of some time, or what you just described, is sometimes I catch myself fantasizing, and like, I wish I had meditated more yesterday so that I wouldn't feel this so much unwholesome thought. And I realized that thinking was wrong. It should be, I feel this way right now, let's practice this right now. So it helps me to be more present, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Well, when you're not more present, can you see that and say, aha, I see that I am not present, let me be present right now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And come out of our desire for wanting things to be different and come into that state of things are good enough right now. Wanting patience, wanting to have already practiced, wanting to make the practice easy, wanting any and all kinds of stuff like that. Is what the beginner gets into. And the answer to that is an easy answer, and that is to see that stuff and say, okay, I'm going to practice being satisfied right now. I don't want anything. What I'm doing right now is good enough, and it will help build the skills for later. Well, while you're wanting those skills, you're not developing them, and so they won't be there later. And then you'll have the same thought again, and you'll want it again and don't have it again.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I found myself have to talk to the voice in my head that it calmed down. Once in a while say, surely it couldn't be this easy. Like, are you saying just practice? And it's just like.

**Speaker B:** Uh, that's the whole point. When you say surely it can't be this easy, that's an unwholesome negative thought right then and there.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And you can say, watch me, I can do it. But surely it can't be this easy is the same thing as saying that, oh, it's hard, which is another kind of unwholesome thought. And when you can see that, you can catch it and say, I can do this right now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I've been telling myself a lot, I won't say all the time, but at least more frequent now, when I say I am satisfied, more and more frequently I was able to feel that way, and that's great. There's always this very small voice that says, well, you're satisfied now, but some hours later you're not going to be satisfied. Um, I feel like— all right, can.

**Speaker B:** You see those small voices inside? All of those rules that you make. And this stuff is actually coming out of what Freud calls the superego, or what Eric Byrne calls the parent. Ego state. So some back long time ago, somebody taught you that you can't, that you're not good enough. And so when those negative thoughts come up, like, oh well, you can do it now but you can't do it later, you can see that too as an unwholesome thought. Aha, I see you. You're in here to muck it up. You're in here to mess my mind up, and I'm not going to let you do that. I'm going to come back and be satisfied right now, not worried about the future, because right now I'm building the skills that I need for the future.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And there's all of those negative thoughts, those put-downy thoughts, those 'you're not good enough' thoughts. You need to see those because they come in a wide variety. You've just given me two different examples of the variety of the ways that you can sabotage your practice. And see those sabotages, see those, and say, 'Aha, I see you.' Be happy that you can see them, because by being happy that you see them, you're making a change. That's a change right then and there. Normally what you do is you have those thoughts and then you agree with them, and then you feel bad. But now you're going to have those thoughts and you're going to say, ah, you can't make me feel bad right now. I'm going to feel content and satisfied and okay.

**Speaker A:** Is it possible? I've been feeling this more and more. I feel like this is only something I can know in the future. I won't have the answer, but I have a feeling the more content I feel, everything I do will be easier.

**Speaker B:** Well, certainly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Things are hard when you don't like to do them. Things are hard when you're telling yourself you can't do it. Things are hard when you keep making mistakes and you don't like it. But in fact, mistakes are our teachers. You see a mistake and you say, 'Aha, now that I see it, I can fix it.'.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. I was— is it possible I can befriend this this negative voice that comes up, or maybe I should just, I don't know, not befriending, maybe befriending more the wholesome thoughts. Yeah, I think I feel the thing I'm lacking is I need more faith. Okay, when I say I need more.

**Speaker B:** Faith— You caught it! Good, right, right, right. There you go. This is exactly what we're talking about. Catch those things.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, I see you now. Wow, this is so difficult. I mean, like, it's so tricky.

**Speaker B:** No, it is not difficult. That's another unwholesome thing. It's not difficult. You caught it again.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker B:** You're changing the habit patterns of the mind rather than being frustrated with the way they are by saying things are so difficult. Then you can say, aha, I see that, and they're actually easy because I can see it now. Okay, keep having to make the change. We have to use right effort, and as I've said before, right effort actually is the least amount of effort in order to get the change made.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's the least amount, the least.

**Speaker B:** Amount of effort to actually get the change made. And yet many people struggle and fight and say it's hard because they're using the wrong effort.

**Speaker A:** What is the wrong effort?

**Speaker B:** Saying it's hard, saying, oh, it won't happen next time, oh, I can't do it. That's what makes it hard, and those are the wrong efforts. The right effort is, "I can do this. I can practice this over and over and over again, and it gets easier, because I'm practicing making it easy.".

**Speaker A:** I have— wait, um, yeah, I think the questions start popping up now.

**Speaker B:** And you can say, aha, I see those questions, and this is easy practice. I don't have to have a lot of questions. I can just see those questions and say, ah, never mind. I can feel good and content and happy right now. Those questions come out of doubt, and doubt's a hindrance. And it's a hindrance to what? You feeling good right now, you being satisfied right now.

**Speaker A:** Is wanting negative feeling to go away also not a right approach?

**Speaker B:** Wanting something to go away and feeling, oh, poor me, it won't go away, and the correct right noble effort is to say, you did go away.

**Speaker A:** It did go away.

**Speaker B:** You did go away. You did go away. You went away. Wow, I'm a champion. I chased that unwholesome thought away. I chased those doubts away. I chased those questions away, and now I can just sit here content and happy.

**Speaker A:** Is it possible I can feel compassion for that painful feeling I have? And by doing so— You're already doing.

**Speaker B:** That when you're practicing correctly. You're nourishing yourself. Aha, I see that painful thought. Isn't that nourishing enough? Isn't that compassion enough that you see it? And then make a change. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you could do it. That's compassion. Have compassion for yourself and stop listening to those critical thoughts. And when you hear those critical thoughts, you can say, aha, stop. Let me have thoughts of I'm going to be compassionate to myself, I'm going to be feeling safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. That's the level of compassion that you can have right now, is to nurture yourself rather than criticize yourself.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes I read people saying it's also okay to be with the pain and not necessarily pushing it away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they can make a lot of money off of you by letting you dwell in your pain, and they don't have any answer to it. They don't know how because they don't know this simple Buddhist technique of making the right effort to make a change. This is exactly what prayer is, okay? If people would make the change, they wouldn't need to pray. They pray because they're in pain. And they want the pain to go away and they're looking for something magical to make the pain go away, the right prayer would be the prayer of thankfulness, thanksgiving. Wow, I'm so happy I'm not in pain.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** And it doesn't make any sense to sit in pain because pain is not a teacher. Freedom from pain, that's a teacher. And all your pain is mental anyway. I mean, you don't have a broken arm, your foot's not rotting off. It's all mental pain, which means that you're the one who is using the bludgeon to bludgeon yourself with those unwholesome thoughts. So have compassion and have nurturing, nurturing thoughts. I can do this. Everything's okay. I can do it.

**Speaker A:** Just final question is about the Four Noble Truths of suffering. I'm curious because some people say contemplating on that will give you inner peace and go out of the suffering because you understand the Four Noble Truths. I'm curious.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, finally they'll stop it. That's the whole point. When people cry, they don't like to cry. They don't like to cry in public, they don't like to cry in private, and so they actually take the effort to stop crying. Okay, but we're doing it at a much more subtle level. We're stopping the crying before it's crying.

**Speaker A:** I get it.

**Speaker B:** Don't have to do the mental pain to the point of crying. You can start to buck up right now.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yeah, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go ahead and finish the call now, and you call me in a few days again. You keep practicing to look at these unwholesome thoughts and make a change.

**Speaker A:** I will.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** See you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a core principle of Buddhist practice: **transforming unwholesome thoughts in the present moment instead of dwelling in regret, desire, or self-criticism.**

Here is a summary of the key teachings:

**Core Problem: The Habit of "Wanting"**
The student (Speaker A) begins by expressing a common regret: wishing they had practiced more in the past to avoid current difficulties. Dhammarato immediately identifies this as an **unwholesome thought**. The root issue is a mental habit of *wanting*—wanting to have practiced more, wanting results immediately, wanting things to be different than they are. This state of desire pulls one out of the present and into frustration.

**The Solution: Recognize and Change *Now***
The practice is not about fulfilling that want, but about **seeing the want itself** and choosing to change right now.
*   **The Formula:** When an unwholesome thought arises (e.g., "I should have practiced more"), notice it: "Aha, I see that thought." Then, immediately affirm: **"And I'm practicing right now."** This shifts you from a state of lack to a state of active, present-moment practice.
*   **Right Effort is Easy Effort:** Dhammarato emphasizes that **Right Effort is the *least* amount of effort needed to make the change.** It is not a struggle. Struggling and saying "This is hard" is *wrong effort*. Right effort is the confident, gentle act of redirecting the mind: "I can do this right now."

**Identifying Sabotaging Thoughts**
The dialogue explores the many forms these unwholesome, self-sabotaging thoughts take:
*   "Surely it can't be this easy."
*   "You'll be satisfied now, but not later."
*   "I need more faith."
*   "This is so difficult/tricky."
*   Doubt and excessive questioning.
Dhammarato traces these to internalized critical voices (comparing them to Freud's "superego") that say "you're not good enough." The practice is to **see each one as it arises, be glad you caught it, and refuse to agree with it.**

**Compassion as Nurturing**
When asked about being with pain or having compassion for it, Dhammarato reframes **compassion as self-nurturing**. True compassion is not dwelling in pain but **nourishing yourself** by replacing critical thoughts with supportive ones: "I can do this. Everything's okay." Mental pain is seen as self-inflicted through unwholesome thinking; compassion is stopping that process.

**Practical Outcomes**
*   **Building Skill for the Future:** By practicing contentment and satisfaction *now*, you build the mental skills that will naturally make future practice easier.
*   **Mistakes are Teachers:** Seeing a "mistake" (an unwholesome thought) is a victory—it's the necessary first step to correcting it.
*   **The End of Suffering:** The method directly applies the **Four Noble Truths**. You see suffering (unwholesome thought), identify its cause (craving/wanting), realize it can cease (by changing the thought), and follow the path (this eightfold path factor of Right Effort).

**In essence, the talk teaches a moment-to-moment practice of vigilant mindfulness:** catch the unwholesome, self-critical, or desire-based thought, and immediately replace it with a wholesome, contented, and present-moment affirmation. The goal is to break the habit of mental self-blame and build the habit of peaceful, satisfied awareness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the central teaching about overcoming unwholesome thoughts and practicing mindfulness.

Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The "Right Bloody Now" Joke (The Impatient Prayer)**
*   **Story:** "Lord, oh please give me patience, I need patience, oh please give me patience **right bloody now**."
*   **Purpose:** This humorous story perfectly captures the self-defeating cycle of desire and impatience that traps the practitioner. It illustrates how the very state of *wanting* an improvement (like patience or better skills) *right now* is the obstacle to achieving it. The joke makes the paradox visceral and memorable.

### 2. **The Violinist Who Didn't Practice**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** The violinist who goes on stage, messes up, and while being booed thinks, **"I wish I had practiced."** The answer is: **"let's practice it right now."**
*   **Purpose:** This directly addresses Speaker A's core issue of regretting not practicing more in the past. It reframes the solution from useless regret to immediate, present-moment action. The stage performance symbolizes a moment of failure or difficulty, and the thought "I wish I had practiced" is the unwholesome thought to be recognized and replaced.

### 3. **The Inner Saboteur / Critical Voices**
*   **Metaphor:** The negative thoughts are personified as internal saboteurs, critics, or voices from the past.
*   **How it's used:**
    *   **Freud's Superego / Eric Berne's "Parent Ego State":** Framing the critical voice as an internalized parent or authority figure from long ago who says "you're not good enough."
    *   **"You're in here to muck it up. You're in here to mess my mind up...":** This militaristic or adversarial metaphor encourages the listener to see the thought as a separate entity to be vigilantly spotted and disarmed.
*   **Purpose:** To externalize the negative thought pattern, making it easier to identify, observe without identification, and consciously choose not to engage with it. It turns an abstract feeling into a character you can say "Aha, I see you" to.

### 4. **Mistakes as Teachers**
*   **Metaphor:** "Mistakes are our teachers."
*   **Purpose:** Reframes the perception of failure. Instead of seeing a mistake as a cause for self-criticism ("I'm bad"), it's seen as a valuable pointer ("Aha, now that I see it, I can fix it"). This transforms the practice from a test to be passed into a learning process.

### 5. **Bludgeoning Yourself**
*   **Metaphor:** "You're the one who is using the bludgeon to bludgeon yourself with those unwholesome thoughts."
*   **Purpose:** A powerful, visceral image to convey that **mental pain is self-inflicted** through thinking patterns. It emphasizes agency and responsibility—you are both the wielder of the weapon and the victim. The solution (compassion/nurturing thoughts) then becomes an act of laying down the weapon and tending to your own wounds.

### 6. **Stopping the Cry Before It's a Cry**
*   **Metaphor/Explanation:** When discussing the Four Noble Truths, Speaker B contrasts gross suffering with subtle suffering. He says they are "stopping the crying **before** it's crying."
*   **Purpose:** This clarifies the proactive, subtle level of the practice. It's not about enduring full-blown mental anguish, but about intercepting the initial unwholesome thought that would eventually lead to that anguish. It frames the work as gentle, early intervention rather than dramatic crisis management.

### **Overall Narrative Arc:**
The conversation itself follows a **story of recognition**. Speaker A repeatedly **"catches"** himself in the act of having an unwholesome thought (wishing he'd practiced more, thinking "it can't be this easy," doubting future satisfaction, saying "this is so difficult," asking for "more faith"). Each time, Speaker B highlights this catch as the **victory** and the core of the practice. The underlying story is one of **shifting identity**—from someone plagued by thoughts to a skilled observer who can "chase those doubts away" and become a "champion" of their own mind.

These metaphors and stories work together to make the abstract process of cognitive restructuring tangible, memorable, and actionable.
