### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Um, actually, no, I don't. So explain more to that. That's certainly not what we've been talking about when we've been talking about it. When we talk about Anapanasati and the four foundations of mindfulness, when we talk about feelings, we don't talk about it like that. So please explain what you're talking about. Um, just go back to the analogy of the thoughts of the fuel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I, I kind of took more from the thoughts of fire Sorry, thoughts are wood, feelings are fire. Like, um, the idea that the feelings burn themselves off, you know.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's not true, but a better way of saying it is, is when you stop feeding the fuel, then the fire will go out. Is this not the case in reality?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, I think, yeah, that, that just makes more sense.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if you change the fuel, you will change the fire. Is that not also the case, that there's huge difference between a grass fire, a forest fire, and a gas stove fire?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So when you change the fuel, you change the fire, and when you stop giving the fire any kind of fuel, the fire goes out. Is that not the case?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, so Oh, go on, go on.

**Speaker A:** No, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Well, the whole thing with like feeling your emotions, I think that's something that like I see a lot on social media or whatever in videos.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right. But you're on your social media. You have a whole lot of ignorant children who were repeating things that they've heard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Without knowledge. They've just been repeating old crap.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but I think that there is.

**Speaker A:** Like some— and that's why they have the kind of fire that they have in their mind when they're writing on social media.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I think there is some truth in like, um, it's, it's, uh, not everyone is able to feel their emotions or has like awareness of the—.

**Speaker A:** Of course, that's what we've talked about before, that 99.9% of all of humanity in our culture or most any other culture is just people living out the habits that they developed from childhood that they got from their ancestors and their parents. And our stupidity and our wildfires of the mind go back centuries. And it takes right noble effort to change the fuel. You have to be selective about what kind of thoughts that you're going to have.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So if you have bad fuel, then you're going to feel bad. And if you have really good fuel, then you're going to have an appropriate fire. If you feed the mind happy fuel, then you're going to have happy feelings.

**Speaker B:** I think I've found also with trying that thing of, you know, the wholesome thoughts thing, I found that— and it's probably just, you know, I haven't talked to you enough about it— but I found that maybe I would get too obsessed with my thoughts, and there was too much like control over, you know, every thought, and that was like tiring.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's just mean that you haven't been putting in the right noble effort. When you put in right noble effort, it becomes energetic, and when you put in wrong effort, you get tired. And part of the tiredness has to do with being dissatisfied with the fire that you've produced. But if you're very satisfied with the fire that you produce, then you're ready to pile more fuel on.

**Speaker B:** So is satisfaction, or, you know, acceptance or something, is that the difference that makes the process energetic?

**Speaker A:** Well, you could say in a way that satisfaction is good stuff, but acceptance is polluted satisfaction. In other words, when you accept something, you're really not satisfied with it. Your satisfaction is polluted. You're almost resigned to do it rather than energetically being very happy to be satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I see that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So what can we do then is we can start having some change to the fuel. Let's do that now. Let's start changing that fuel and start having happy thoughts. Thoughts of being safe and secure. You're in a room now, there's nobody there to hassle you, but if you get on social media, you're going to get a bunch of crap. And if you think about the crap that you see from social media, you're going to feel crappy. We're sitting here with me. You can feel nice, you can feel good because you're having happy, good thoughts. Give that feeling system some happy, good thoughts. Let's get it some good fuel. So tell me some good fuel.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, but, but, uh, I'm thinking about— what about awareness? Like awareness?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you can think of all kinds of things that are just 'But what about this and what about that?' Yeah, that's the mind of confusion. So you're actually having confusion thoughts. Yeah, it's going to lead you to have confusion feelings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I get that. But also, isn't confusion like just— it's.

**Speaker A:** Written all over your face. I see confusion all over you.

**Speaker B:** But isn't that just natural though? Isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Um, no, it's normal. But it's not natural.

**Speaker B:** Well, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Why do I say normal? Is because you learn to be confused when you were a child, and that's how— and you kind of think that that's normal. You've gotten used to it, and it's a pretty lousy fuel to be feeding your system.

**Speaker B:** But I was saying more like confusion is just part of like figuring out what you know.

**Speaker A:** And figuring out is still not happy. You can't figure everything out, but you can still try to figure everything out, going from one failure of figuring out to another failure of figuring out, because you're in the habit of being confused trying to figure stuff out. Winding up with a pretty smoky mind. So I invite you once again, let's have some happy thoughts rather than confusing thoughts. You can take the right noble left, do that right now. Well, what about like— what about now? Go. There you go. Yes, but what about— you're being confused, you're full of doubt. Let's have some happy thoughts. Come on. I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** You want me to give you a few examples of some happy, wholesome thoughts, some good fuel to feed to the fire?

**Speaker B:** Well, I feel like, to be honest, I feel like I need to understand.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And if you understand this and understand that, you'll still be saying, but I need to understand that over there. Let's stop trying to need to understand things and start practicing correctly.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but when does the understanding come of these things?

**Speaker A:** You don't need understanding, really, because there's no end to it. No, you don't need all that understanding. All you need is to understand to practice correctly. Okay, you don't need to go inspect every different kind of fuel All you have to do is understand that there is some good fuel and there's some bad fuel. Let's put some good fuel in there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I get what you're saying. I do. Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** So let me hear some good fuel.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Can you say this then? Right now everything is okay. Right now everything is fine. Got no problems and no worries.

**Speaker B:** I've got no problems and no worries.

**Speaker A:** I feel like— Right now you've got no problems and no worries, but trying to understand, and now you just made a problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, because I— this, this, this way of doing it, it's a bit like you know, I guess reprogramming or like positive brainwashing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's about taking a positive frame and reprogramming. Yes, do it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Let'S start having some happy thoughts. Let's change that fuel. I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well But okay, I think it's because there's like lots of other things that are happening.

**Speaker A:** Now you're off into confusion and comparing stuff. Let's not do that. Let's have some happy thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Right. I mean, I do have to express what's in my mind. Otherwise, I feel like I'm like kind.

**Speaker A:** Of— No, you can throw that stuff out and put happy thoughts in. You don't have to express your crap. You don't have to keep feeding bad fuel into the fire.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that feels very different to me. To— I mean, I think that is—.

**Speaker A:** I hear your resistance to having happy thoughts. You're still in a state of comparing and confusion. Can you have some happy thoughts right now? Can you start having some? Can you start practicing correctly? Because until you start practicing correctly, you're going to be in that same confused state of mind, trying to express yourself, trying to figure things out. But you've been doing that for how many years?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but also, like, what if, what if it's you know, what if someone doesn't always want to be happy and like want— just can, you know— I don't believe it.

**Speaker A:** At any particular point in time, you would prefer to feel good than to feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but also, also, there are other— I think there are other ways of feeling good than just being happy. Like, you could be you know, figuring.

**Speaker A:** Out— well, let's use other words like wholesome, skillful. Yeah, lighthearted. Yeah, not heavy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that— I think that's better because happy is like, you know, maybe it's just because of the use of the word or something. It's happy is like— well, don't try.

**Speaker A:** To examine the word, just do it.

**Speaker B:** Well, but I, I want a better word, mate. I like when you said— you don't.

**Speaker A:** Need a better word. What you need to do is to start practicing. Here's a better word: everything's okay. Yeah, I don't have to figure anything out. I can just— wow, what a relief it is. I don't have to figure everything out. I don't have to get the right word. I could just be comfortable.

**Speaker B:** But maybe I'm happy when I'm questioning you. What about that?

**Speaker A:** Well, you're used to questioning.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And it takes effort to make a change.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So let's take some right noble effort to start making some change. Otherwise, you're stuck into being used to asking a lot of stupid questions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But also, what if I'm not my—.

**Speaker A:** What if I'm— what if— yeah, I hear this 'what about'ism.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but what if— no, like, for real.

**Speaker A:** Do you recognize how resistant you are to actually start practicing correctly?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, but also, I mean, I'm thinking, I'm just, you know, like— what I'm thinking about in life and trying to achieve and like what my day-to-day is, is more not so much focused on like any kind of like Samadhi state, or I'm not trying to go to any enlightened person.

**Speaker A:** I'm not asking you to do anything like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, because I just want to say, I mean, I'm more focused on like um, you know, music and, and art and stuff.

**Speaker A:** So I think— can you do that happily? It's your choice.

**Speaker B:** Half of the time.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's start practicing so that you can do it more of the time, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, because I just, I just wanted to clarify that, like, I'm not, um, looking to, like, go in— like, I've kind of like lost the— I just don't desire to kind of like, you know, get really spiritual or like— I'm.

**Speaker A:** Not asking any of that. I'm asking you to start having some wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** I know, yeah, but I just wanted to clarify.

**Speaker A:** And you're resistant to doing that. Let's have some wholesome thoughts. Okay, right now all you're giving me is whataboutisms and doubts and Yeah, frustrations and worries.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wanted to just make sure that we were on the same page, and I just wanted to like just say that.

**Speaker A:** You'll not find if we're on the same page until you get on this page.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I wanted to make sure that you knew like what I was going through, like kind of like, you know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** I don't care what you're going through. I don't care what kind of bad fuel you've been using, right? Okay, I'm trying to get you to change the fuel to something wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I get it. Yeah, I get it.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's hear it then. Come on, let's have some wholesome thoughts. Everything is okay, everything is fine. I don't have to figure everything out, I'm already okay. I'm already okay. Now here I have spent 10, you know, already given you 10 wholesome thoughts in a row and you haven't repeated one of them.

**Speaker B:** I just have some— like, there are just a lot of questions in, in my mind.

**Speaker A:** I know. Can you stop having questions in your mind? Stop having that kind of fuel and start having some happy, wholesome thought fuel. Yeah, and you take the right noble effort to start saying, and right now everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** I have to keep questioning. I mean, what about— what about— no.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to keep questioning. What about— in fact, so long as you keep questioning, that's where you're stuck, is questioning, questioning, questioning, and not recognizing that you've got a choice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right, right, right. Because yeah, I guess I'm just trying to like—.

**Speaker A:** You know what the word try means? Yeah, yeah, try already has failure built right into it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so let's have some positive thoughts that are not failure thoughts. Can you repeat after me?

**Speaker B:** But I feel like asking questions is good.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm not. I'm not into answering a bunch of stupid questions one after another after another. I'm into getting you to change and start following my lead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but, but yeah, I just, I think I— it's— I talk to a.

**Speaker A:** Lot of people who keep asking me a lot of questions, and I'm getting you know, uh, getting a little short.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I can tell. Yeah. All right then.

**Speaker A:** Um, all right, so how about repeating after me?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Right now everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Right now everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay, that you're there in that room alone and everything is fine in that room.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I agree. Everything is fine in this room.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Bhavana.

**Speaker A:** Wow, everything is fine. Come on, repeat after me. Everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Okay, yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, I can feel relaxed.

**Speaker B:** I can feel relaxed.

**Speaker A:** Because everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because everything is fine. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** I'm okay.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is. I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what a relief it is that.

**Speaker A:** I'm— What a relief it is I don't have to ask questions. I can just be okay.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to ask questions. I can just be okay. I'm not sure about that one.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to ask questions, you can just be okay. Look how many thousands of questions, by the way, that you've asked and you're still not okay. So let's not practice having thoughts and questions. Let's start having good wholesome practice, wholesome thoughts. Everything is okay, everything is fine, everything is fine. Yeah, so I don't need to worry in the world.

**Speaker B:** I don't need to know anything. Is that what you're saying?

**Speaker A:** I don't have to know anything more than I already know. I already know enough. I know enough to be okay. You can say that. Can you repeat? I know enough already to be okay.

**Speaker B:** I know enough already to be okay. What if for like, you know, I've.

**Speaker A:** Got to— What if, what if, what if I hear that stuff coming back?

**Speaker B:** There are lots of things. So for specific things that you're doing in life, you need to, you know, know something. Maybe like you're sick and you need to know what doctor to go to, or like, I don't know, you need.

**Speaker A:** To— You can do that later. Right now you're going to sit and practice and get yourself into I'm okay. I don't need to know anything right now. I'm okay right now. So I can take care of that later. Right now I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** So when do you, you know, these questions that I have, what do I do with all these questions?

**Speaker A:** Let us put it this way. You spend 5 to 10 minutes every hour telling yourself that you're fine, that you're okay, and leave the questions to the other 50 minutes in an hour. Okay, right now you're spending all 60 minutes in asking questions and staying not okay. Let's start practicing being okay, and pretty soon you can spend more time just being okay. You begin to see this is a whole lot more fun. Yeah, no, it's a whole lot more interesting to just be okay and stop asking all of the stupid questions that you never get resolution to. All you get is a bunch of smoke.

**Speaker B:** Okay, can we talk about that for a bit? I mean, I don't— I just want to understand more about that.

**Speaker A:** So I then— All right, this is all you need to understand is that you're okay right now. That's all you need to know is that everything is okay, everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** It's so— it's— yeah, I know I said this last time, but it's just so simple. It's like the simplest thing to say, and it's the thing that I guess, like, your mom says when you're like— when you're hurt, you know, she's like, it's okay. It's just like the most basic simple expression that's like, yeah, you're all right, you know, ever. There couldn't be more— there's nothing simpler that could be said. To help someone. And sometimes you can't.

**Speaker A:** You're helping— you're helping yourself now. So let's start saying you're okay. You don't need to ask a lot of questions a lot of the time. You can in fact just stop asking questions and be okay. Everything's all right. You not a problem in the world. Come on, let me hear it. Everything's all right, got no problems, got no worries.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, everything's okay, I've got no problems, I've got no worries. Although I don't fully believe what I'm.

**Speaker A:** Saying because of— Well, that's why you haven't practiced it. You've been busy practicing a bunch of crap. Now let's start practicing something of value. Maybe it'll, it'll sink in. That everything really is okay. Okay, you don't have to fix the world. Wow, you don't have to do anything. You can just sit and relax, start to enjoy your life. No place to go and nothing to do. Wow, what a relief it is. Whatever work there is to do, I'll do it later. Right now I'm just going to sit and relax. I could just be okay. Everything is fine, no problems, no worries. Everything is okay. Come on, let me hear it.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay, there's no problems, I can relax.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is. Got no problems.

**Speaker B:** Oh God.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is. Keep going. Don't go back off into that. Why wonder? Why wonder? I wonder. Just keep coming back to everything is okay. I don't have to wonder or wander.

**Speaker B:** I just— yeah, no, I agree. I agree. But I, I like that. I know. I— yeah, but because I, you know I know I may be saying things that you disagree with, but I want to know why you disagree with them so that when I go and practice, I can feel like it's the right thing to do.

**Speaker A:** Well, you know deep inside it's the right thing to do. It's your surface that's confused because you've got such bad habits of putting in bad fuel. But you know that if you start putting in better fuel, you'll have a better fire, a happy fire, an okay fire, a joyful fire. Doesn't matter what kind of words you're using. Perhaps the right word to use is satisfying. So long as you're asking questions, that's a direct proof that you're not satisfied. You want answers. You're not satisfied. Come on, let's practice being satisfied. Everything's all right.

**Speaker B:** Everything's all right.

**Speaker A:** Everything is fine. I can be comfortable. I don't have to know everything. I already know just enough to be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. I know just enough to be happy.

**Speaker A:** I know just enough to be happy, and I'll practice being happy. I'll keep that in mind. I'll keep having that kind of fuel. Everything is okay, and I don't have to fix anything. Everything is already okay. Now, in that regard, you can take the work out of everything. Yeah, make everything that you do a toy. Become playful. Okay, you have to practice being playful. You have to practice enjoying what you're doing. And the way to do that is to stop doing everything and just enjoy. Make the joy first, make the satisfaction first, and then you can add stuff to it. Later without destroying your joy. But you need to practice being okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, and so when I— oh God, I've just lost my thought. When I'm doing this and then I have a question or a thought, like I just don't agree with what I'm saying because of something that's just like you know, happen.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because then you get confused and you can say, oh, I see that and I'm just going to drop that thought and have a happy thought instead. I can just sit here and be satisfied. I don't have to figure that out. You're looking all confused again because on.

**Speaker B:** One level I agree with it, and it's like, you know, you can't really argue with that.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't argue. I gave up arguing. Yeah, yeah, that's why in fact I keep bringing you back to correct practices, because I don't want to argue with you about all the crap that you keep coming up with.

**Speaker B:** But it's good for me to know, like, why you disagree.

**Speaker A:** Why then?

**Speaker B:** It's good for me to know why you disagree, because then I can, like, go into the practice with more, like, confidence.

**Speaker A:** I'm not interested in agreeing and disagreeing. I'm interested only in you starting to practice correctly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but, but, but there's a lot of like— with all my questions, you'll—.

**Speaker A:** You, you— right, I'm not interested in your questions. I'm interested in you practicing correctly. And if you start practicing correctly, you will see the benefit. But if you don't practice correctly, you're stuck in those questions. And then with all of the questions, you're not practicing.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** If you start practicing, you'll see the benefit. Yeah, yeah. Wow, I can be satisfied.

**Speaker B:** So what you're— and also, because I haven't even heard, like, your specific Dhammarato, like, teaching is— No, it's not.

**Speaker A:** It's the teaching of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And his main teaching is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha— asking questions. In fact, you probably know that doubt and worry and restlessness are hindrances. What are the hindrances to feeling good? They're unwholesome thoughts. This is actually the teaching of the Buddha. Can you start having wholesome thoughts like everything is already okay? I don't have any problems to solve right now. Everything is all right. Wow, what a relief it is. I don't have to worry and trying to figure stuff out. I can just be okay.

**Speaker B:** About the Buddha, was he more concerned than people think about feeling good than like, you know, going into Nibbana and escaping Samsara? You know, was he— How do you.

**Speaker A:** Think you're gonna get anywhere by going in the wrong direction?

**Speaker B:** You know, but I'm asking about like, was Buddha more into feeling good than going into Nibbana as people perceive.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's— let me give you this definition of Nibbana. Let us say that you're in a truck, maybe a bicycle, and you're out on the road. The engine's running and you're running down the road, and things get hot. The brakes get hot, the tires get hot, the radiator gets hot, the engine gets hot, the exhaust gets hot, right? And there you are getting someplace, asking a bunch of questions. But when you park the truck and get out of it, right then and there, the truck is still hot. But if you don't keep running it, if you let it sit there for a while, doesn't it cool off? Right. So you need to start practicing having wholesome thoughts long enough to actually cool off.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** You start giving that firehole some happy food, it's going to burn in a better way rather than smoky and smelly.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And pretty soon you stop giving the fire any fuel at all. Why? Because you've just decided that everything is okay, everything is fine, I don't have to worry about anything, I can stop giving it fuel altogether. But then it'll cool off, fire goes out. What fire goes out? The fire that's fueled by wanting to know, wanting to figure it out, rushing around in the mind to here to there to try to get something instead of just being satisfied with what you've got.

**Speaker B:** How you've got where you are though now, didn't you have to go through lots of periods of asking questions.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Do you want to go through all of the stuff that I went through for 45 or 50 years before you stop, or can you stop now?

**Speaker B:** So, so you didn't have to go through that to get where you are now?

**Speaker A:** I was more in a hurry. I wasn't full of doubt. I was full of restlessness.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but wasn't that in some way part of what was needed?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's to stop being restless, become satisfied. Hmm. And you stop asking questions and just settle down and be satisfied. And when you become satisfied, you'll chill out. But you got to practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so practice just being satisfied with—.

**Speaker A:** Um, well, you need to start with practicing having wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay, awesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** All of those students who try to practice having no thoughts at all, they can't do that. Yeah, need to start practicing having wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** I feel like, yeah, my— when I have, you know, when I do sit down and practice, it is better. And I feel like I've kind of been doing a bit of that, and then I've been doing a bit of breathing.

**Speaker A:** Well, while you're paying attention to the breathing, that's wholesome, especially if you're controlling the breath, making sure that it's a long, easy breath. Yeah, definitely one that I like. Oh, I like that breath. Do you think that breath is satisfying? It's— wow, what a relief it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Is controlling the breath, do you think, better than noticing the breath?

**Speaker A:** That's what the Buddha teaches. He teaches having long, deep breaths. This is what he means by Anapanasati, mindfulness of breathing, not just breathing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's weird how like you don't hear that, you know, at monasteries or with people who are into this. You know, it's like the Vipassana thing of your little nose. You've got to notice the breath coming out of your nose. But I find that there is no.

**Speaker A:** Nose tip anywhere in any sutta.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** He talks about experiencing the body while you're breathing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was actually going to go to a Vipassana retreat like next week, but I think I'm not going to go. I think I'm going to cancel it.

**Speaker A:** Well, what you can do instead is getting a tent. The Buddha doesn't recommend go to retreats. Yeah, Buddha recommends go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, or go to an empty hut. The room you're in is empty if you take out the computers and the cell phones.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I think I'd like to do that. That would be cool.

**Speaker A:** Or maybe just, uh, buy some camping gear. You can get camping gear to go camping for a week or two. Cheaper than you can pay for the retreat. So go get yourself a tent and a camping stove, a mat, or your cheap sleeping bag, and go off into some state park.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's cold, but yeah, could do that.

**Speaker A:** Go be alone. Here's something very interesting. Those retreats, they practice what they call Noble Silence, and they pretend for each student to pretend to be in seclusion, while in fact the reality is you've got 100 people within elbow distance. Yeah, Buddha recommends go into seclusion where the air is not filled with everybody's thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think you can definitely feel— I don't know, maybe you disagree, but I think you can feel when you're sitting in a, like, a meditation room or whatever, some places have much better environments. It's like depending on the kind of people, or would you say that's right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and a meditation hall that's got no people at all is the best environment. An empty hall.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely. And so what about— so empty that.

**Speaker A:** Even when you're sitting there alone, you're still not even there. All of those thoughts of, uh, I gotta know this and I gotta know that, you can just forget those thoughts and just sit there and say, wow, this is nice, everything is okay. Got no place to go, nothing to do. You can do that out in nature.

**Speaker B:** And you'd say that's like also true, and you're not just telling yourself, you're not just brainwashing yourself, like it's actually true, you would say?

**Speaker A:** It actually is true. You're okay. You're okay without all of that information you've been struggling to get. All of that worry and confusion is keeping you from just being okay, just sitting and relaxing. The reality is you're already okay, Freddie. You're already okay. Wow, what a relief it is. You're already okay. You don't have to figure out anything. You're already okay.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I think that's good actually. I think that's—.

**Speaker A:** So can you practice that? Can you practice, I'm already okay, I don't have to know anything, I've already got everything I need and I'm already okay, just as I am, I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** And when I have things that I want to do, you can say, hey.

**Speaker A:** I don't need to do that, I'm already okay. I don't have to go do that, I don't have to want that. Know for sure that anytime that you want something that you don't have right now, that's Dukkha. You're dissatisfied with right now, you want to go do something. But if you can have the happy thought of, well, I don't have to go do that, I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** And what if the thing, um, like, like making music, what about that?

**Speaker A:** Well, here's the point about that, is that you've been making music for so long that you're in a music school and you're still not okay. Look at all that music you've made and you're still not okay. So let's practice instead being okay. And when you are okay, you can sit down with that score and be okay while you're playing. You can be okay with the thought of I'm okay while you're being creative. You can turn it from a work which has been all these years, into joy, into a toy. Yeah, become playful. Yes, I think I've got to practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been getting better at that, and I think I'm enjoying music more, and I think I'm like just— I'm not serious about it, but I just try to just play it and just—.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is what you need to practice, is being not serious. Become playful. Well, I'm already okay. I don't have anything to do. I'm already okay. And now I can pick up that score and have a blast. I can have fun with it.

**Speaker B:** So it's not about not— it's not about avoiding desires. It's more— it's more— look, it's more important to practice being okay than to avoid desires based on— Right, because if.

**Speaker A:** You'Re desiring, if you're avoiding writing the music, now you're in a state of being not okay even when you're not writing the music. So when you're writing the music, you're not okay, and when you're not writing the music, you're not okay. And when you're having a bunch of thoughts about how do I figure it all out, you're still not okay because that's the habit you're in. What you have to do instead is start practicing being okay. And once you get into the state of I'm okay, everything is okay, I don't need to know anything, now you can sit down with that score and have a great deal of fun with it. Okay, you're okay before you start writing, you're okay while you're writing, and you're okay after you finish writing. And you're just okay, and you don't have to worry about anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's amazing. So it's kind of— I'm with the desire, back to the desire. It's not about— it's more about the, um, the Dukkha or the expectation attached to it, like the grasping.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and always that expectation is, I'll feel better after I get it or get it done. Yeah, and you're never going to feel better after you get it or get it done. The only way you're going to feel better is by practicing feeling better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay. So yeah, expectation is that, and then there's the attachment from a story you've come up with about an identity. So that might be more hard to.

**Speaker A:** That's actually the story that you tell makes you unhappy because you're dissatisfied with the story that you tell. Why don't you just start telling yourself the story, hey, I'm already okay. Wow, I don't have to figure anything out. I'm okay. I'm already just fine. No place to go and nothing to do, nothing to do. I can sit here and enjoy the breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And as you get better and better at this, do you find that insights come? Because I'm quite like— obviously, because I have a lot of questions, that means I'm probably interested in— I guess I like insights.

**Speaker A:** Most people do not understand what we mean by insight. No one understands, especially those who use the word Vipassana. All right, let me give you this insight as a definition of insight. Oh, I see that I want to understand a bunch of stuff, and that's not helping me. Let me practice being okay already. Now that's insight. And you had quite a lot of insights today. I've seen you smile. I've seen you being confused, and then you come out of it for a short time, and then you go right back into it. Yeah, you've had insights today. The insight is, is that you can be happy. The insight is you can be okay, that you can be satisfied, that you could be joyful. That you can be energetic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can. You don't have to mope around thinking, I've got to know this and I've got to know that. Oh, see, that's insight right there. That was it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's funny.

**Speaker A:** It is.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato laughs. Wow, isn't that great? You can see it. That's what we mean by insight, is to recognize that the patterns that we've been practicing, what we've gotten used to, is not helping us, that we have to make a change. We have to start having wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** And the whole questions thing about like, because when I was talking about insights, I was thinking about like insights about, you know, like knowledge stuff, you know, like when you have an insight more not what you're talking about, but more like, you know, like a discovery about life or something.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's it. You just discovered something about life. Asking a bunch of questions and getting information isn't making you happy. Yeah, you have to practice being okay. Yeah, you have to practice because you've been practicing having a bunch of questions and getting used to that. But the real insight is, wow, I don't have to do that. I can just relax. I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess I can't.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Checkmate. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So are you going to go practice? That's my question. Are you going to go practice correctly? Having thoughts of everything's okay, everything is fine. Yeah, you are. Okay, well, you go do that. You go practice some 5 minutes every hour. Yeah, just practice. Oh wow, I can take 5 minutes off and just be okay. I don't have to worry about anything for 5 minutes. You go practice that.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And then call me.

**Speaker B:** I will do that. Maybe I'll call you in a week or two.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** I'll message you.

**Speaker A:** But it's important that you make that commitment to me. Yes. You're going to go practice being happy. Practice being joyful. Practice being satisfied.

**Speaker B:** I will. I promise.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. Well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Bye. Thank you so much for that. I'll see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on a core, practical instruction for overcoming mental suffering: **consciously choosing and cultivating wholesome thoughts.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Metaphor: Thoughts are Fuel, Feelings are Fire**
Dhammarato corrects a misunderstanding. The point isn't that feelings automatically "burn off," but that **you can change your feelings (the fire) by changing your thoughts (the fuel).** Unwholesome thoughts (confusion, doubt, worry) create a smoky, distressing mental fire. Wholesome thoughts create a pleasant, satisfying fire. If you stop feeding the fire unwholesome fuel, it dies down.

**The Main Instruction: Practice Wholesome Thoughts**
The entire dialogue is Dhammarato persistently guiding Speaker B away from abstract questions and "whataboutisms" and toward a simple practice:
*   **Stop** the habitual internal dialogue of questioning, figuring things out, and seeking external understanding.
*   **Start** deliberately feeding the mind "good fuel": thoughts like **"Everything is okay right now," "I'm already fine," "I have no problems, no worries," "What a relief."**
*   This is framed not as naive positivity, but as **"right noble effort"**—the active, energetic work of reprogramming ingrained mental habits.

**Key Insights and Clarifications:**
*   **Resistance is the Habit:** Speaker B's constant questioning is identified as resistance—a deep-seated habit of confusion mistaken for normality. True practice requires breaking this cycle.
*   **Satisfaction Over Acceptance:** Dhammarato distinguishes between polluted "acceptance" (resignation) and genuine "satisfaction," which is joyful and energizing.
*   **Understanding vs. Practice:** You don't need endless conceptual understanding to begin. The primary understanding needed is that you have a choice: you can select your thoughts. The insight (*vipassana*) is seeing that your current thought patterns cause suffering and that changing them brings peace.
*   **Application to Daily Life:** This practice isn't about avoiding responsibilities or desires (like making music). It's about first establishing a baseline of "okayness." Then, activities can be done playfully, as "toys," not as stressful work fueled by the desire to *become* happy upon completion.
*   **Goal is Here and Now:** The aim isn't necessarily a far-off spiritual achievement, but to feel better now. By consistently practicing wholesome thoughts, the mind naturally settles and cools (*nibbana* is likened to a vehicle's engine cooling off after stopping).

**The Takeaway:**
Dhammarato's teaching is a direct call to **action, not analysis.** He urges moving from the passive, confused state of "trying to figure life out" to the active, simple practice of **mental hygiene:** repeatedly choosing thoughts that generate a feeling of present-moment safety, satisfaction, and relief. The promise is that this practice itself is the path to well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphor used throughout the talk is the **"Thoughts as Fuel, Feelings as Fire"** metaphor. Here’s a breakdown of the metaphors and implied stories:

### 1. **Primary Metaphor: Thoughts are Fuel, Feelings are Fire**
This is the central, extended metaphor that structures the entire teaching.
*   **Fuel (Thoughts):** The mind's content—what you choose to think about. It can be "good fuel" (wholesome, happy thoughts) or "bad fuel" (confused, questioning, worrying thoughts).
*   **Fire (Feelings/Emotions):** The resulting emotional state. A fire fed with bad fuel is smoky, chaotic, and unpleasant (like a "wildfire of the mind"). A fire fed with good fuel is warm, pleasant, and appropriate.
*   **The Mechanism:**
    *   If you change the fuel (thoughts), you change the fire (feelings).
    *   If you stop feeding the fire fuel (stop engaging in certain thoughts), the fire (negative feeling) will go out.
    *   The goal is to stop feeding the "firehole" (a playful term for the mind/feeling system) bad fuel and instead give it "happy, good thoughts."

### 2. **Supporting Metaphor: The Cooling Truck (for Nibbana/Nirvana)**
Speaker A uses this metaphor to explain the concept of enlightenment or cessation (*Nibbana*).
*   **The Story:** You're driving a truck (or bicycle) —the engine is running, everything gets hot (brakes, tires, engine). This represents the agitated, striving, questioning mind in *Samsara* (the cycle of suffering).
*   **The Cooling:** When you park the truck and stop running it, it naturally **cools off**. This represents the practice of stopping the fuel of craving and dissatisfaction. When you stop feeding the fire of wanting-to-know and rushing, the mind cools down. The "fire goes out" (*Nibbana* is often described as the "extinguishing" of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion).

### 3. **Implied Stories & Analogies:**
*   **Social Media as a Source of Bad Fuel:** Speaker A explicitly states that social media is where you "get a bunch of crap" and if you think about that crap, you'll "feel crappy." This frames the online world as a provider of low-quality mental fuel.
*   **The "What-about-ism" and "Stupid Questions" as Bad Fuel:** Speaker B's persistent questioning is itself identified as the "bad fuel" that creates confusion and dissatisfaction. The habit of questioning is compared to a smoky, out-of-control fire.
*   **Reprogramming / Positive Brainwashing:** Speaker B initially frames the practice of choosing happy thoughts as "reprogramming or like positive brainwashing." Speaker A essentially agrees, reframing it as the necessary work of replacing deeply ingrained bad mental habits ("stupidity and our wildfires of the mind go back centuries") with wholesome ones through "right noble effort."
*   **Turning Work into a Toy:** Speaker A suggests that any activity (like music) can be transformed from a stressful "work" into a "toy" by first establishing the "okay" state. You practice being okay first, then engage in the activity playfully, rather than hoping the activity will make you okay.
*   **The Meditation Retreat vs. True Seclusion:** An implied analogy criticizes group meditation retreats. They practice "Noble Silence" but have many people in close proximity, which is compared to a hall filled with everyone's thoughts. True practice, following the Buddha's advice, is likened to going to an **empty hut, forest, or a tent in a state park**—a place where the "air is not filled with everybody's thoughts."

### Summary of Metaphorical Teaching:
The core message, delivered through these metaphors, is: **Your emotional state (fire) is directly determined by your chosen mental content (fuel). Suffering arises from feeding your mind with the fuel of craving, doubt, and endless questioning. Peace and happiness arise from consciously selecting the fuel of wholesome, satisfied thoughts ("I am already okay"). The ultimate peace (*Nibbana*) comes from letting the fire of craving cool down by ceasing to feed it altogether.**
