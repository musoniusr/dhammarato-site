### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so, hi guys. So we'll start with DJ's topic of the movie on Discord of Shengyam, or maybe that's not how you say it, but— and then we'll get to— what was your name again, friend?

**Speaker B:** Robert. I used to be like really active in the Sangha, and I've had some personal challenges the last several months. I've been kind of in my own little bubble, so. I'm like getting back into it for the self-nurturing mode, returning to nurturing, you know, that's kind of my feeling right now.

**Speaker A:** That's what we all do, it's a natural progression. We leave the Sangha for a couple of months and come back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But what were you saying DJ about that movie?

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, so the documentary that went over the Chon Master, Shengyan, I believe, and just his life. And it was very inspiring, you know, his dedication to the Dharma and, you know, him coming back because it talked about, you know, he was pretty much forced to join the Chinese military, right? So there was a period where he had to disrobe because he joined like before that at quite a young age, right? And then he was like very sad because he had to leave. So he was able to get back in and he was very enthusiastic about it and it was like that enthusiasm, I mean honestly it helped to motivate my own practice and just keeping it going but it was very beautiful and very inspiring and there was a lot of cool stuff in there in terms of the Chan tradition and another thing that I really, that brought up to mind was sort of the how, you know, it really does bring things together because, you know, thinking about all the different schools of Buddhism and how they all kind of point back towards, you know, that freedom, right? That freedom from dissatisfaction at the end of the day. But they all have like different sort of methods of doing that. And even like the Pure Land Buddhism, you know, sometimes, you know, Westerners might look down upon it and be like, it's all magical and stuff, but there is a technique there, and the Chan masters and stuff do recommend it. And when we think about that in terms of, you know, the practice here where we're changing the mind from, you know, unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, you generate the thought of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and it's like a pure thought, and you gladden the mind with absolute confidence in the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker D:** Trust in the Dharma, right? So even if you're kind of at an earlier stage, you know, not that we're— it's not like, okay, we have stages here, but you're like developing and what have you. You have that thrust of, okay, I'm going to trust in the Dharma. I'm going to come back because like for some people they felt like, okay, they don't quite have that time to dedicate to it. So that's a very simple method, right? So anyway, that was just my sidetrack on Pure Land Buddhism. It was really cool, actually. A couple years ago, for my birthday with my family, we actually went to a temple here in Niagara Falls. That was the Temple of the Thousand Buddhas. And so they were doing the Pure Land chanting, and I joined along and I was chanting with them and I was getting into the vibe, right? Because I'm just like, hey, you know what I mean? I'm not going to be like, oh, you know what? I'm practicing the Theravada forest tradition and all of this is just like, you know, no, it's like, no, go in and embrace that and be able to see the Dhamma there. And I think that's the whole thing. It's really about, especially with the projects like the Open Sangha Foundation and stuff, like really bringing the Dharma together in that sort of like non-sectarian way. And that's what you see, right, in like the Chinese schools and stuff, like how they're utilizing all these different things. And different techniques, and they play off of each other, right, to help, you know, people find Dharma and liberation, you know, in their own way. But again, I really do appreciate a lot of what we talk about here in terms of like, you know, going back to the suttas and back to like that sort of direct thing. But then we have a wonderful balance where like you, Dhamma Dassa, are very much into the Zen aspect of it as well, you You know what I mean? And so there can be that balance. So it's wonderful that, you know, if there's this open dialogue where we can kind of work back and forth between the different schools and understand them, right? And not be so fixed to like one or another, right? So that we can have an open mind and be able to see the truth as the truth. Anyway, I might have went on a little bit, but back to the movie, it was Yeah, it was very inspiring how dedicated he was to the Dharma and just— yeah. So anyway, if anyone else would like to comment on that or— Did you.

**Speaker A:** See that movie, Robert?

**Speaker B:** No, I haven't seen it. I just found it in the Discord. It's Master Sheng Yen. Yeah, I just opened it on a tab and I'll save it for when the right time arises.

**Speaker A:** It's an interesting watch for sure, even if you're not into Buddhism. For people who just are getting into it or curious about it, it was entertaining just on its own. I thought it was well done, well made. I like how they made certain scenes like kind of like that weird cartoon drawn over the actors. You know?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the Buddhist teaching discussion.

**Speaker A:** I love that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that was beautiful.

**Speaker A:** So cool. And it's so cool how he was just like a monk on the street. And I don't know what city, I don't know if it was Chicago or where, but he was in America.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And he was just like a monk just on the street. And he had like the one devotee. And I love that about Buddhism is like, they're just, his whole goal for the day was just like, well, let's get a bagel. You know, let's eat one bagel a day and drink some water, and let's try not to freeze in the snow, and it's a wonderful day. Talk a little Dhamma and practice a little Dharma, and that's all they needed, you know.

**Speaker B:** That's great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it reminded me of what— oh, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh, go ahead, please.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I was just going to say it reminded me of what Ajahn Chah said, like when he would wake up, if he had his bowl of rice for the day and his water, enough water for the day, he said, "Oh, all my problems are taken care of." I always liked that.

**Speaker B:** That's very nice. I really like that too. You know, it's interesting. I was just thinking, as you know, DJ and yourself were talking about the documentary and about the Chan Master, I realized like most narratives about Buddhism, there's a fairly linear trajectory. You know, it might be kind of roundabout, like the Buddha's trajectory, right? Like first he went to fast all day and be an ascetic, and then, you know, he went and tried something else and this and that, and then he ends up under the Bodhi tree, right? So roundabout is a pretty common path, I would say. But I mean, it was for the Buddha, at least that was Buddhist path, you know. But I kind of wonder, like, I've noticed with myself, like, I've been practicing the Dhamma. I first started, and I think it was 2011, you know, and so I was 17. I'm 30 now, like 13 years, right? And I know, like, for me, like, My path has been like what we said at the beginning of the call, what you said at the beginning of the call, Dhamma Das, is take a few months off and then come back, right? It's been like that where I'd have these periods of diligent practice and I'm really engaged and lots of right effort, right attitude. And then I somehow get derailed or lose interest or doubt emerges, etc. And then it's like I fall off the path. You know, for a period of time. And I find like getting back on the horse is pretty challenging, kind of like going to the gym. Like when you are in the habit of going to the gym, it just gets easier and easier to go to the gym. But then if you stop for some reason, you know, you got sick or whatever, it gets hard to get back to the gym, right? Same with the Dhamma. And I feel like so many of our like great Buddhist stories, whether it's like Thich Nhat Hanh, or Ajahn Chah, or Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, or, you know, insert person here, famous monk, famous teacher, even Jack Kornfield, etc. They all seemed to be the story of first they were ordinary, then they like became a monk or something, or they went to India or whatever, and then they were never really ordinary again, you know. And I think I never really realized this until right now, but I think maybe like that type of story, and I would really like to watch documentary, you know, at least for me as someone that's kind of off the wagon, on the wagon, off the wagon, on the wagon, it's like a little demoralizing in a way. It's like, why can't I stay on the wagon? You know, why do these guys, why can they stay on the wagon for like 50 years? And then for me, you know, like why did I not have that good kamma, you know? And, you know, and what, you know, I know it would be my fault, right? You know, it's my responsibility, of course. But nonetheless, like, it's a little demoralizing. Like, I would love to read a story about a famous teacher. I guess Alan Watts was maybe a little bit like this, you know, where, like, they kind of, they got into it, but then they got out of it, and they got into it, then they got out of it, and they got into it, and they got out of it, and then Eventually they just got into it, maybe at the ripe old age of 50 or something, or who knows, right? You know, and 50 is not that old these days, but you know, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, you know, ironically, it's not really something that you can even get in or out of. It's always there. The reality. And we happen to get on certain roads that allow us to clear off our glasses and see the road more clearly, if only for a moment. But it's always— the reality is always there. And how you were talking about— what is it you were talking about? I forget, the circular journey, so to speak. I think sometimes in regards to that, sometimes what a lot of people, they don't see with the Buddha, his story himself, Siddhartha Gautama, that he did all the hard work for us already. He already went in the forest searching, he already left the family, he already starved himself and emaciated his body. And then out of that, he was born his natural wisdom that was already there, but he discovered that. So in a way, he did all the really dirty work for us. And then he set for us as a beautiful gift, the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, in a nice, neat little clean package just for us. But sometimes when we over-intellectualize the Buddhist journey, we look at him as an example, which is great, but oftentimes we feel mistakenly that we have to suffer as he suffered at the beginning. We have to go through the emaciation and the different types of different religions to get into and the different practices of meditation to get into. But I think it's helpful to keep in mind this trust in what he did discover, and that is the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. And if we stick to those two things, I think it will help greatly. I can't speak for you or anybody else, but for myself, if I keep it simple stupid, it's much easier to remain on the path. And in truth, we never really end up leaving the path because we're all swimming in enlightenment. Our true nature is enlightened. Our true nature is a calm mind, a calm body. It's our delusion that creates the separation. It's our delusion that creates more Dukkha for ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Sure, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, I think you're right that, you know, given that the Dhamma is just kind of seeing things as they are you know, just very, you know, pretty cut and dry, you know, a cheerful nihilism, what have you. Very cheerful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's a wonderful nihilism, right? You could even say that, or just a chill nihilism.

**Speaker C:** That's kind of more— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What separates Buddhism from nihilism is the Sila and the Metta. You know, is the everything is Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, whereas the nihilist might say everything's just meaningless. Maybe it's a type of way of saying that, but also we have the Sila and the Metta in there in the Eightfold Path. We have the nurturing, we have the basic precepts also of just not killing, not lusting after— and it's not just sex— lusting after everything in the material world. So the nihilists are very much hedonists in disguise as nihilists, you know, whereas the Buddhist is more like, um, not really a materialist. And with that Sila and Metta, that's the whole package, you know, because we have the compassion, we have the morals and the values. So people say, okay, you're a Buddhist, so then you just think everything's Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, so fuck it, right? Do whatever you want. It's like, no, no, that's what the Buddha said actually causes Dukkha.

**Speaker D:** That's wrong view. That's wrong view. That's why it's so important to have that balance, right? And not to succumb to that wrong view, that nihilism, and to not be trapped by right view, which is all the rules, the rites, and the rituals, but to come back to the true view, the true view that is the true view that— yes, and it's a viewing because we look and we discern right now and we investigate, you know, Dukkha, Anicca, Nirodha, the Four Noble Truths. We can directly verify this within our experience, and the more we investigate this, the more we look into this, you know, the more we cultivate and develop, the more often this tree will bear fruit. Right. But the point is, is we recognize, well, it's just coming back to dropping the ignorant thirsting. But when we do that, we return back home to this, which is, you know, just that easy satisfaction or freedom from dissatisfaction. When you are free from dissatisfaction or suffering or stress, there is nothing you want in this world. But the point is, is we can still operate in our lives. I was talking to you a bit about this. Robert, right? But from that point, it allows us to be more moral because we're not going to be swayed by our, you know, desires or what have you. We're going to be wise to them. And then we come at the world from a place of service, from a place of wanting to give back, you know, from a place of friendship, right? And so again, it's beautiful. It's actually— yeah, no, it's not like that kind of like Yeah, like wrong view where it's just like, oh, nothing matters and all that stuff. Yes, there's a certain context where we can go that and it can be helpful for like realizing, but that's the balance. That's sort of the beautiful thing coming back to the Chan and the Zen, you know, kind of schools, right? Where they go back and forth between like the koans and all that stuff and penetrating into, you know, reality directly. And then they say, wash your bowl, eat your food, come back to what's happening now in a very basic way. Right.

**Speaker A:** And that's also— it's also not just— that is an interesting phrase that he was saying. What was the exact phrase you were talking about? Like a happy nihilism, Robert?

**Speaker C:** Cheerful nihilism. And another way of talking about it too, like what the Dalai Lama says is wise selfishness is like the path of the Dhamma, essentially.

**Speaker B:** And what— And what he means by.

**Speaker C:** That is like if one is acting in accordance with, you know, the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Noble Path, etc., like one will naturally find themselves more calm, at peace, joyful, you know, free from Dukkha, right? And that's where the That's why I say cheerful nihilism. I think the word nihilism is kind of an extreme word. Yeah, like, you know, kind of have an image in our mind of like a black void when we think of nihilism. But like, like the— what I'm talking about when it comes to cheerful nihilism is, you know, the Buddha never talked about God, you know, providing meaning for the universe or rebirth. Well, I mean, he did kind of talk about that. That's other topic. But I mean, he didn't talk about like, there's some like, grand moral architecture to the universe, whether it's God or it's just the spirit, the Great Spirit or something like that. And you need to satisfy and live in alignment with this. Like the Buddha sort of said, at least in my understanding, if you want to be happy, you know, and free from suffering, you know, at least just free from suffering, which is another way of saying happy, right? You know, content, right? Then what you need to do is let go of things, practice morality, you know, and practice mindfulness, etc., etc., right? And but it's like, and the genius of it is, if you compare that with, say, a system like Christianity, or even Hinduism, or Judaism, you know, I'm I'm half Jewish, half Catholic, so I can lay claim to both those traditions. But those traditions are largely about appeasing some greater being, and.

**Speaker B:** That'S why there's.

**Speaker C:** These elements of shame involved. If you're not practicing enough, that tradition, you're displeasing the Lord, you go to hell, or you, you know, don't get as nice of a heaven. It's actually funny, in Judaism— I should double-check this because I haven't studied Judaism in a long time, since I was a kid— but my understanding is they don't actually have hell in Judaism. Yes, this is correct. Okay, now it's all coming back. But there's like a purgatory And after you die, you stay there for a certain amount of time, kind of paying for whatever, you know, infractions you committed. And then the quality of the heaven you get into depends on how virtuous you were. So it's like there's like 100 different degrees of heaven.

**Speaker B:** And so it's like, like, like each.

**Speaker C:** One is still heaven, right? But if you're like a really great person, you get like the 100th percentile of heaven, you know. And if you're just kind of okay, you're pretty good, you know, you're overall good person, you're like 50th percentile.

**Speaker B:** It's a lot nicer than the Christian.

**Speaker C:** Worldview of, you know, damned to burning in eternity, as you know, sort of thing. Yeah, you know, so it is more better than that, but it's still— there's still this element of you're judged, you know, at the end time, at the after you die, etc., right?

**Speaker B:** And Buddhism is saying there's no one.

**Speaker C:** Judging you, you know, this is your life, you know, do you want to.

**Speaker B:** Have suffering in your life or not.

**Speaker C:** To have suffering in your life? If you don't want it, you know, here's the way, check it for yourself. That's the famous line in the suttas, right? Investigate for yourself, right? And that's why it can be considered kind of a cheerful nihilism in my point of view is it's, you know.

**Speaker B:** It'S like, uh, it's, it's like the.

**Speaker C:** Buddha is saying, like, if you were to ask the Buddha a question, I would imagine something along the lines of, you know, why should I care about not suffering? Like, is there going to be some big payoff here? Am I going to go to heaven? Is the— is God going to win the battle against the devil at the end of times? Because of me practicing this? And, you know, or is all my— are all my descendants going to be blessed or something like whatever, right? And the Buddha would say, no, I don't know about any of that, but, you know, you'll be happier.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, you do this, you know.

**Speaker C:** You know, and that brings it back to this grounded, kind of materialistic event. Like, like just nuts and bolts, you know, this is it sort of thing. I kind of— I was just going.

**Speaker D:** To say, Robert, I kind of get like from, yeah, a certain point of view. And I think sometimes, you know, you're into philosophy, right? Nihilism might get a bad rap, but there's actually some pretty, you know, interesting things when it comes to philosophy, you know, and, and that sort of thing. So a happy kind of nihilism, yeah, in some context that might you know, makes sense. It's interesting though, because it's almost like as we investigate into Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, we become, I guess, more aware of like what's actually there. Starts not that there's like an objective morality, but it's almost like a right morality is born out of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha as we continue, like moment to moment as we continue to investigate what leads to Dukkha, what doesn't lead to Dukkha. Like, yeah, there's that sort of element, but I do kind of get, yeah, that sort of like a happy nihilist. You know, there's no sky daddy or something giving us moral laws on high, right? It's like, no, it's— Yeah, I mean.

**Speaker B:** Some of these.

**Speaker C:** Religions, like I once took a course called God at university and the Professor gave us a different book every single week on a totally unrelated topic, but it was somewhat related to it, like the Rwandan genocide, Freud, history of sexuality, all these different topics, right? There was one book there about native religion in the very early founding of— like before America was a country, like the 15th century, the 16th century, like 1400s, 1500s, et cetera. Right. And a lot of the beliefs people had back then, it's similar to the Pentecostals today, actually, where it really was that spirits were everywhere and you are engaged at all times in a battle for the fate of the universe between God and the devil. And that was like a very widespread belief, you know, and like if you sinned, like you were helping all the evil forces win this giant battle, you know, if you did good things, you were helping the forces of Christ, you know, like a Christian, you know, you know, very extreme form of Christianity back then that was really popular. Pentecostals believe the same stuff today, but No, and Buddhists are like, hey, just chill out. You know, like, like, you know, there's no need to— you don't need any of this to find happiness.

**Speaker B:** And maybe you're right, you know, I.

**Speaker C:** Don'T know, I can't see those spirits, but maybe I just can't, you know, you know, but I don't know, I.

**Speaker A:** Just want to be more of like a practical psychology or a science.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker C:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** You know, and it's hard for Westerners to kind of disassociate from those early Christian or sometimes Abrahamic religions, including Judaism. It can be difficult to separate the two because like Dhammarato always says, the Western mindset, and I agree with him, always running the race, always climbing the mountain. You know, we had the unconditional love when we were children, but what happens around the age of 7 or 8? If we were lucky, but generally speaking, and then around 7 or 8, all of a sudden that unconditional love becomes very conditional. Do your homework, go to school, take out the trash, all this stuff. And then at 40 years old, you say, hey, I did all the hard work. I got all the degrees. Where's all my nurturing love? And it's no longer there. And Buddhism steps in and says, That's never going to happen unless you change your mind, unless you change those unwholesome thoughts to wholesome. And we're remembering to look in a balanced way throughout our day. Check in with yourself. Is there any dissatisfaction here? And it's subtle. You have to really look. You have to really be aware of the present moment. Is there dissatisfaction? If there is,— and there usually is, we change it with our wholesome speech, both inner and outer, and the right effort. And we change it. And then we give ourselves that nurturing care and love that we all want so badly as children and say, "Yes, you did good. You did change the Dukkha into Sukkha." And then we build the Piti, the wow factor of, "Yes, I can do this." And then we build the confidence, and that confidence over time, over a short period of time, we build momentum, and then it becomes an easy method, the Buddha's method for changing the Dukkha into Sukkha. And when you say the wise selfishness, I like that. I like that phrase a lot because it's going above and beyond the materialistic selfishness. A certain type of person is required to go all the way with the selfishness, and it transcends that mundane selfishness into another realm of, I don't want the temporary sense pleasure, it's just the other tail end of the same Dukkha snake. I want the real pleasure. I want the real Sukkha.. And that can only come right here, right now, gladdening the mind right here, right now. Like Dogen Zenji said, if you can't find peace right where you are, right where you sit, then where will you find it? You won't find it in philosophy. You won't find it in questions. You won't find it in answers. You won't find it in the beautiful story we tell ourselves about our past and our future that doesn't exist. This fictitious ego character. Yes, at some level there is a self, but the Buddha was talking about Anatta— there's no soul. And part of the reason I believe he talked about there's no soul is not only to discredit the metaphysical— it's not even valuable, the metaphysical aspects of it— but to show you that when they probably talked about a soul back in the day, it was probably greatly tied to the story of the ego, the past. The future soul spirit going on this odyssey, this adventure. And the Buddha said there is no soul. You know, sure, there's a type of person. We're not crazy. We have a past. Sure, there'll be a future. There's something here, but we don't have to become so attached to it as if it was a soul that actually exists. And that takes a lot of pressure off of us. Unlike the other religions you're referring to, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, absolutely. And I think also, like, in our culture and Western culture— by the way, I know DJ, you live in Canada, in Quebec, right?

**Speaker D:** Or— oh no, in Ontario, so by Niagara Falls.

**Speaker B:** And Ontario. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Oh, very cool. It sounds beautiful. And, and Dhamma Dasu, where do you live?

**Speaker A:** I'm just outside of Chicago.

**Speaker C:** Oh cool, have you.

**Speaker A:** Met Keishon? A while ago. I haven't talked to him in a long time. When I was on here years ago, he.

**Speaker C:** Was on. Yeah, he lives in Chicago and I've actually met him in person.

**Speaker B:** Oh nice. Yeah, it was pretty cool. I'm from Seattle and I right now.

**Speaker C:** I've been splitting my time between So I've been living in Bogotá, Colombia, in South America with my wife and child the last— we have a 9-month-old.

**Speaker B:** Now. Congratulations.

**Speaker C:** Thank you. Yeah, since March 2022. And lately I've been splitting my time between Seattle and Bogotá, etc.

**Speaker B:** So, but anyway, I mean, like, I.

**Speaker C:** Guess back to the Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you for the congratulations. I really appreciate it. But back to the point.

**Speaker C:** About the sense of ease and presence and, you know, all of these things versus when weighed against the pressure that our society puts on us, much of which was probably religious in origin and now is more kind of capitalistic you know, than religious, you know. Um, but, you know, I think, um, it's so— that programming is so pervasive. It's so easy to get swept up in that. And I think this is partly why the monks would really, like, kind of seclude themselves within the Sangha, you know, in a— at a wat, you know, or a or monastery or temple or, you know, Zendo, whatever terminology is for whatever community they're part of, pagoda, whatever. And, you know, it was like, it's hard to get away from that influence, you know. And I think this also like goes back to my earlier question or point. And I know also, Dhammarato, you said a few minutes ago, you know, questions won't and answers don't bring you happiness, you know, but questions can be fun too. Anything— those things don't bring you happiness, but also we can enjoy doing anything at the same time. Yeah, you know, um, but, um, yeah, I mean, I'm curious, like, do you guys know of any famous, you know, Buddhist master sort of figures that are well known where they kind of fell off the wagon and on the wagon a bunch of times? You know, they weren't really just on the wagon, maybe till the end, you know, the later in their journey. Alan Watts is the only one that I can kind of think of, but maybe Ram Dass a little bit.

**Speaker A:** But you know, it reminds me of if you take an apple, right, and you say, okay, I have, I have a half of an apple, okay, then I have, you know, 2/3 of an apple, then I have 3/4 of an apple, and you could keep taking a small amount. At what time does it cease to be an apple? So when we say, are there masters, are there people who have gotten into it, dropped off, gotten into it, dropped off? From only my opinion, I can say it's never dropping off. Once you hear of the Dharma, the dropping off or continuing the path exists solely as a conceptual notion. You know, we're all on the path. Some may call it Christianity, some may call it atheism, some may call it nothing, some may never refer to it at all, but we're all on the path. But I guess if you're technically speaking, is there masters who just once they got into Buddhism, they just stuck it out. I'm sure there's some that have done it more so than others on one hand, but on the other hand, I don't really think it matters because it's just humans being humans. It's like, you know, is there waves in the ocean? Is there masters who haven't gone up and down? You'd be hard-pressed to find any perfect master who just got into it, practiced it perfectly from the word go. It's almost as ridiculous as saying, is there anybody who just got into physical fitness and just stuck with it their whole life flawlessly? I don't know, there was times when they were infants where they couldn't do physical fitness, so technically no, but the majority general response would be Everybody falters, everybody comes and goes. Do some do it more or less than others?

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But it doesn't really benefit us in our practice right now to dwell on such things. But it's an interesting question.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, for sure. I think like oftentimes also like there's.

**Speaker C:** Like the mythology of the master that's.

**Speaker B:** Like different from the reality, you know?

**Speaker C:** And like sometimes like that difference is really extreme, like in cases of abuse or whatever. That's usually what we hear about.

**Speaker B:** But like, they're also, you know, like.

**Speaker C:** I remember one time I visited like Zen Mountain Monastery in New York State, like upstate New York. And one thing that they said there.

**Speaker B:** That kind of struck me is one.

**Speaker C:** Of the— so they had the Zen master there, right?

**Speaker B:** His name was Shugen.

**Speaker C:** And he was like this really luminous.

**Speaker B:** Profound sort of presence, right?

**Speaker C:** And one of the senior monks, when.

**Speaker B:** People were talking, said, you know, the reality of living here is, you know, you're living with a bunch of humans.

**Speaker C:** And humans aren't always easy.

**Speaker B:** He said even Shugen is just a guy, and sometimes he has some rough edges, you know. Yes, you know, you know, and, and that always stuck with me. And I think the reason why is like, we do tend— and I think the media is kind of part of this, honestly, because like like good movies and good films and stuff. And I haven't seen the Zen Master one, I'm sure, you know, so I have no comment on that. But I'm just saying in general, right? Like they play into these archetypes, you know, and that's part of like what makes them interesting for us is like the archetypal language, right? And like, if someone— so when they're telling the story of, you know, how Johnny became the Zen Master, You know, like, it's not, for whatever reason, it doesn't seem to resonate quite as much if Johnny is still, you know, mad sometimes that his toast is burned or something like that. You know, it's like, is he really the Zen master? You know, so you don't, like, you know, hear those stories as much.

**Speaker A:** That's the Western idea of making the archetype of an enlightened being otherworldly magical thinking superhero type of person, Greek mythology type of person that doesn't really exist. That's childish foolishness to think of a man with rainbows coming out of his eyes, you know, because even the Buddha, who would be the exact archetype that we're talking about, the perfect master if there ever was one, said himself, or at least his students claim from the Pali canon, that even on his deathbed he still dealt with a little bit of Dukkha coming his way. But the only difference between him and the ignorant student would be that he was able to recognize that Dukkha as it arose and change it in the moment and say, aha, I see you, Mara. Right? Whether Mara was in the form of stomach pain or lust or whatever, he was able to see it and change it. So the Buddha was very much a man, and he, even on his deathbed, he was tempted by Mara, but he had the wisdom to see Mara for what she was, change her into the wholesome, into the Sukkha. So these stories of the perfect master on a mountain and all this Jesus type of walking on water. This is just fiction. This is not very— it does more.

**Speaker C:** Harm than good in some ways. No, totally. I think this is one reason I think Daniel Ingram has been quite popular, even though he doesn't do ads or anything. He doesn't have an ad campaign. But I think he's still, through word of mouth, a lot of people like him. And I think the reason why is because he talks about The Dark Night of the Soul, right? Now that terminology doesn't really apply to Buddhism, of course. But the whole idea of saying, hey, we all fall off the path sometimes. He really kind of harps on that. And most teachers kind of gloss over that a little bit. And I think that, I don't know, at least for me, I think That was maybe one reason I found it interesting to like listen to podcasts with Daniel Ingram or read his stuff. And I never practiced Mahasi style. Actually, I did in Thailand, but that was kind of different from what he was doing, but you know what he was promoting. But kind of, I mean, a lot of similarities, but some differences, you know, but like I do think like That is like one area where I know for me personally, you know, and maybe I'm sure a lot of other people feel this way, like, I can get so discouraged. You know, it's like, I'm off the path, like, I fall off the path, and I've been off the path for months, this last several months, I've been going through a hard time, you know, and, you know, you know, personal life, you know, family issues, etc. And, you know, and I just, I'm like, wow, I feel like such a dummy, you know, and it's like, you know, why am I— this is the time I need the Dhamma the most. And here I am beating myself up over, you know, not being able to, you know, successfully navigate my personal crisis I'm in.

**Speaker A:** Look at your speech just now, right? You said, oh, I feel like such a dummy. No, don't say that. It's going to become true if you say that. You have to learn to speak in such a way that you say, my body was just doing human stuff. It was going up, it was going down. And part of the reason that that guy you mentioned resonates with you, from what it sounds like, is because he was okay with humans being humans, acting like humans. Exactly. Not being, oh, I'm just this perfect master, here we go. And then when I mess up I'm in a world of depression because I thought I was this perfect— no, the perfect master messes up all the time. He just doesn't take it as a big deal, and he learns from his mistakes and never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I think like in Theravada Buddhism.

**Speaker C:** You know, which is what Dhammarato teaches, um, like, it's, it's the— that's the original teaching, you know, like the other teachings, like they kind of like Tibetan has that core, but it has all this other stuff too, right, about Bodhisattva, you know, etc. Zen is kind of quite similar but talks about things in a very different sort of a way, right? But it's quite similar, you know, like the different traditions are all kind of different dressings for the same stuff, right, at the end of the day. But like, I know with Theravada, this original flavor of Buddhism, like the very first form was a monastic religion, right? Like, this was not for everyone. This is for people that, as Dhammarato would have said, are noble, right? They really want to clear up suffering, right? They're really just done with Dukkha, right? And that's who this is for. So you look at the Vinaya, right?

**Speaker B:** Monastic code.

**Speaker C:** And there's like 200 and something different laws. By the way, in Judaism, there's also something like that, 200 and something different rules, um, mitzvahs. They're actually— it's a little more positive, actually. It's 200 and something mitzvahs. Mitzvah is like a good deed, so 200 and something good deeds you can do. But, you know, but anyway, and so, you know, and I think like that original form, you know, of Buddhism, which I think all three of us and everyone in this group have gained value from, and is a beautiful tradition that has so much wisdom that can help everyone. I think at least for me, in my perception sometimes, is that, you know, the bar is high to be noble, you know.

**Speaker B:** It's like there's 200 and some— like.

**Speaker C:** This is for the monks, you know.

**Speaker B:** And like, if you're a layman, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, it's like, well, it's extremely easy. And even Even Theravada, it may seem like, oh, this is the purest, this is the most, but their culture got soaked within the Buddhist teaching as well with their ghosts and rebirth and the mundane teaching. It's still soaked in some of their wats in some places. And that's why Buddhadasa at the time was considered a kind of controversial figure because he brought that Theravada that you say is the most pure form of Buddhism. He actually brought it more from the mundane aspect into the supramundane, and that's also why he appreciated Zen as well and esoteric forms of Christianity like Tolstoyan Christianity, because they were more in line with the Buddha's original teaching. So Theravada, in Thailand at least, is not immune to that cultural influence. Whatsoever. But when you hear Dhammarato talk about changing our unwholesome— our thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome, that's actually— when he's talking about all that stuff, remembering to look in a balanced way throughout our day, is there dissatisfaction? If there is, we change it with our inner and outer speech and right effort and our right intention, and we change it from Dukkha to Sukkha. That's actually the purest form of Buddhism. That's the Eightfold Noble Path. And that's what he's trying to communicate when he talks. All these other things of putting monks on pedestals and feeling that you'll never be at their level and how difficult it must be to be noble, that's actually part of the reason it's difficult to be noble is to get out of that mindset. Of hierarchies, of robes, of rituals, of difficulties, of race running, of mountain climbing, the Samsaras that the Western cultures have implanted into us. That's why it's difficult to be noble, because we think in a way that we're unworthy, that it must be difficult, it must be something that only a Superman can accomplish. But no, the teaching actually is anybody with half a brain can accomplish this. It's not difficult at all. And it's not this super enlightened rainbow fantasy that we've created in the West. That's why it's so profound, is because it's available right here, right now, in a very simple way, so simple a child could understand. But in a way, it's like seeing God for a child. A man can't see God who's in a business suit and worrying about money all day because he lacks the innocence of a child to play the games and to be light on his feet and to be silly and to be cheerful and to see God in that way. He'll never see God because it's not that it's difficult to see, he just can't possibly lower himself to that level. But really, all it would take is a little humility. And he would be able to play and be happy and see God in the moment. So it's quite easy, and it's not something magical. It's something practical. It's not something to be fawned over like some golden carrot to chase. It's something that's here that you can do, DJ can do, I can do, Dhammarato can do. The Buddha did, and part of the Buddha's brilliance was showing us that it's available to even us poor slobs. It's available to us even here, now. It's not yet another thing to chase, yet another thing to go after. Only the Theravada monks with their golden robes can do it. No. Buddhadasa said you have to go beyond both a monk and also a householder.

**Speaker C:** To get the Dhamma.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, we are beyond compare, friends, and there's no benefit from comparing ourselves to others. We limit our own potential, right? And all we do is cause bad feelings by doing that. But when we don't compare, you know, both we can recognize here and now the complete and total, you know, quenching, you know, the end of dissatisfaction. And also we have unlimited potential for cultivation so that we may do good deeds, so we may help inspire, you know, so we can continue to do that as well from that basis of the end of dissatisfaction. And again, it can be done right here, right now, by anybody who has an ear, who can hear, you know, the Dharma and, and just be receptive to it. Oh, it can be done.

**Speaker A:** Lay the burden down. It's so easy and practical, it's often overlooked because we say, well, I'm happy now, I'm joyful now, there must be something more, there must be something more than this peace that I feel now. And there isn't. What could there possibly be other than this moment, other than Good enough is okay. Good enough is perfect. You know, everything's Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. So you don't need to chase after anything. Just enjoy gladdening the mind right here, right now. Enjoy the breath right here, right now. And anything else is just a distraction, a delusion.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, because there's no point in worrying, because worrying you know, you're so caught up in the past and the future with worrying that you wind up stumbling, falling. What you want to do is come back and care for what's going on, what's happening, attending to what is currently happening. Even if what's currently happening is you are planning something in the future, be mindful, be aware, remember that you are planning currently in this moment, and do so from a place of wisdom. As opposed to from a place of ignorance, you know. And yeah, yeah, no, yeah, it just— when it is applied, it works. I'm saying that, you know, I know it works, like, just directly. It does. It's— I mean, I could go on, you know, about— and all the bubbly language that you could say about this, but at the end of the day, it's just wow. And Nothing.

**Speaker A:** Nothing. Don't worry. Be happy. Don't sweat the small stuff. Everything's small stuff. But that's not good enough for people. They want the rituals. They want the gods. They want the carrot that's just out of reach. They love the chains that bind them. They love the fetters that bind them. And that's the difficulty, is getting out of those negative habits. Which is actually.

**Speaker B:** Easy peasy. Right.

**Speaker C:** And I think like, for me, I just need to— I think all that stuff about, oh, it's so out of reach, that's just my own stuff. You know, that's not what it is, right?

**Speaker B:** You know, and that's right.

**Speaker A:** And it's like, everybody has their own stuff, you know, everybody has those thoughts once in a while, and that's okay. But you then come back to reality and wake up and say, wait a minute, that's delusional thinking. It's not this crazy thing that's out of my reach. It's not difficult. It's right here, is right now. Gladdening the mind right here, right now.

**Speaker D:** That's what I love with the nurture, right? Or I find it to be of great value is to, you know, come back to that congratulations. When you notice the mind going into the unwholesome, congratulate. Notice that it is of benefit to notice that because it's changed. Once you've noticed that, you say, oh, wait a minute. The unwholesome, it's dangerous. It's not for my benefit. So you can easily discard it and give it up and congratulate yourself for the process. So when you notice all of your, you know, Samskara, so all of your traumas, all of your habitual tendencies, all this stuff, all your baggage, you can be happy. You can see it. And now rather than, you know, holding it in, You know, you actually are cleaning it out. Like, people will be like, oh, well, this is like repression. It's like, no, this actually allows you to burn through your traumas with this illuminating light of wisdom that will just tear through them. And if you are practicing Dharma in such a way, it can be a blast to do this. It can be so much fun, so engaging to practice Dhamma. It is something to be enthusiastic about. To develop that joyful success and recognize that in just this breath, the one that we can take right now, and recognizing that just this in-breath is enough. As we exhale, we can recognize that it is complete and total success. It is a higher success than climbing any mountain in the world, any high feat you could get from a worldly pleasure. Tramples it. It destroys it. It is better than it. It is better than any conceptual thing you could come up with. Just chilling out. Nothing beats chilling out. Nothing in this world beats chilling out, you know. Nothing beats nirvana, Nibbana, blowing out.

**Speaker B:** Anyway, like I was trying to say, I would say something to— I would, I would maybe a little modification which is all those things are fine too. It's not, you know, no, that's true. Like, all that's fine. You know, like, that's fine. Taking your breaths, fine. It's all the same, right?

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** You know, that's kind of the idea. And I know, like, for me recently, and I was talking to DJ about this a bit earlier, like, since I became a father, like, I've felt like enormous pressure, you know, and this has pushed me off the path. Honestly. And it's funny because it's the time I need it the most, you know, but it's like, oh yeah, I've gotten so caught up in the pressures of being a father, you know, providing for the family, being a husband. And then also my dad had a big health event January— not January, July. And so I've been like trying to help him too. That's another thing. And then my life is in these two continents basically, and that adds complications. And it's like, well, I guess like my external world is complex in a lot of ways, you know, and I do feel a lot of pressure, you know, from all these different parties, you know, and, you know, whether it's like I feel the most, you know, from my wife, the second most from my father, my son, he doesn't want to give me any, he just smiles and laughs, but I love him so much. That I give myself. You know, he's not giving me pressure directly, but like when he cries, you know, it's like you feel pressure even though that's not like his mindset isn't, I need something from you and I want you to feel pressure, right? Like maybe other people might have that mindset, but a baby doesn't think that way, right? They're just like, hey, I'm uncomfortable right now, you know, help me please. You know, um, you know, sometimes he just wants his daddy, you know, that's totally true. Like, he wants me specifically, you know, and, and I love that actually. That's kind of a nice feeling, you know, like that he loves me in this way. But, um, but yeah, like this pressure, you know, that I'm under in my life right now, it's so much, you know. And, and, um, especially as like the sole provider, you know, my wife is you know, been in school and doing internship, whatever. And, you know, she, you know, and so it's like lots of pressure. And then I feel like, or I guess maybe like she kind of puts on to me, you know, and then I accept what she puts on to me. But what she puts on to me, and then I accept, and I don't even mean to accept it, I think it's kind of unconscious actually, is like if I'm not trying hard enough, you know, if I'm not working hard enough and trying to do all these things hard enough, like I'm failing. And that's kind of the opposite of the Dhamma, which is like, hey, let's deep breaths. Yeah, take it slow, one thing at a time.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, and it's like, I know that's the truth. But the pressure is intense. And I'm like, that's why I'm here today. I just had enough. I was like, yeah, I just got to go talk to some Dhamma people. I'm just done with this pressure feeling all the time.

**Speaker D:** You know, that's what it's all about, is alleviating that pressure, alleviating that stress, alleviating that suffering and dissatisfaction. And then it's like, then you can operate in the world from that place of service, from that place of wise choices, of recognizing that, yeah, just when I'm caring for my son, when I'm caring for my wife, just this is enough. Just this is so sweet. And you can savor it and you can understand it, but you're not attached to it. So you can move on to the next thing. So you can care and nurture with even more skill, and you can develop and grow in that sense of, you know, our conduct and how we behave in the world. And that can just keep growing, and we can keep developing, and it can be such a wonderful thing. Well, coming back to this place of just chilling out, of just being at ease, of relaxing, of being chill, but also able to recognize that joy, like, you know, of, wow, this is so wonderful. And then we can also just enjoy taking care of, you know, the things, yeah, back in the world, back, you know, from a place of friendship.

**Speaker A:** And DJ, remember when we talked about how suffering or the beginning stages of Dukkha are kind of like— or like the pressures Robert is talking about of life— are kind of like the bell that's rung at like a Zen monastery? And what does that bell signify? The bell signifies us to wake up and remember to look and remember to change. So all those pressures that you're feeling, Robert, instead of looking at them as just these pains in the asses, look at them as blessings that are going to wake you up and remind you that, hey man, in the physical realm, what could you possibly do other than try? You can just try to fix the physical problems in the physical realm. And on the inner problems, all you can do is just change the unwholesome to wholesome. So there, all your problems are solved. You got pressure? That's the bell that says, oh, that's the reminder to not take my life too personally, not take these things too seriously. You have responsibilities, sure. My son has autism, he's nonverbal. I can sit around every moment of the day and think, oh, what's going to happen when he's older? Who's going to take care of him? How was his life? I could have a myriad of things that will drive me to the brink of insanity if I sit here. Or right, I could look at his smiling face in the moment. When the bills come, when the troubles arise, I try to take care of them in the physical world the best I can. And what a blessing it is to have my son. He's like having the Buddha himself as a child, and he's my greatest teacher. And all the pressures that he brings along to me are actually blessings. But it's all a matter of changing the way we're perceiving these things with our inner speech, our right effort. If you have these pressures come again, embrace them as friends. And then say, this is a natural part of life. I'm not the only person on earth with these pressures. Everybody's got pressures. Everybody's got problems. You can handle it. You can do this. You can do it. You have that confidence. And I'm sure you could do it. You seem intelligent. You seem capable. And this is the speech you need to tell yourself when these pressures arise. Hey, how old are you? You said you were 30-something. Just 30. Hey, you made it so far, right? You're 30 years old. You've done it so far. And I'm sure you'll be able to do another 10 years, another 10 years after that, just like our parents did, just like everybody else did, especially if you have a Sangha, especially if you have the Buddha on your side, which not many people choose to do. But not only are you dealing with these pressures of life, you have this whole Sangha on your side. You have the whole Dharma within you to help you along your way and not just help you, not just to survive, but also to thrive in this environment. Not just to carry on in this environment, but to joyfully carry on in this environment. It is possible. I do it every day with my son and his nonverbal autism. DJ does it in his life with all the pressures that he has to deal with. And I'm sure you'll be able to do the same thing. And it will get tough sometimes, but never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** You know? Absolutely. I have a question also for you. You know, and I think you can probably relate given, you know, your son. So like, one of my, you know, big issue— well, I'd say probably my biggest issue lately you know, has really been like the way my, uh, you know, just my wife. I'll just put it in that way, in her kind of way of treating me, right? So, um, where she just often really focuses on the negative a lot. Oh yeah, it's been this way. Like, it really started like, I deal with that. Yeah, you know, it's so hard. Like, like, I'll tell you guys a story from the other day, right? So We were flying from, you know, New York back to Bogotá, right? And, you know, and so we're in, so it's time to go to the airport, right? And I can tell my wife's really tired, right? And so what do I do? I chart out a whole trip, you know, with Uber. Okay, we go from here to the hotel, like 2 stops. First hotel, get the luggage. Then we go to the airport. And then before that, like, as we're waiting, I run to Trader Joe's right next to where we were. We were at like a little kid's place or, you know, cool, cool spot for kids. And so I run there and I get beverages like water for everyone, like these little baby water bottles for the baby, like food, you know, for her. She was hungry. Food for him. I get everyone set up, I get everyone into the Uber, I help them, we go to the hotel, I get the luggage, I take care of all that. Then we go to the airport and I get us all organized. I get us to the counter. Turned out we left one of our bags in the Uber. It was in the front seat. The guy just put it in the front seat. Cleared out the back and where we were in the— and so the trunk and then the back, you know, we cleared that out. But the front had something we forgot. The guy, the Uber driver, didn't speak a single word of English. He was from Georgia, Eastern Europe. He only spoke Russian— Georgian, I mean Georgian, you know, probably, you know. So I had to contact Uber in order to contact him because I can't call him because he doesn't speak English. Then, yeah, then I get him to bring the bag I get the bag, then I get us to the flight, and then they tell us the seats we got, they actually can't give us because a baby isn't allowed in those seats, even though they already knew we had a baby in the booking. So then I have to get us new seats, and I decide to be really kind to my wife, upgrade the seats, you know, for like $100 or something, right? So she can have bigger seats because she's not feeling well, she's really tired. She's really stressed and I want her to feel okay, you know. And it's late at night, so baby's sleeping, right? Get to airport security. You guys get the gist, right? Like, I could go on and on like this, but basically I took charge of this whole thing. I really did my very best to help my wife and my son, right? Because she wasn't feeling well, she was out of it. So I took over, I did my best, right? And when I was doing it, I was happy to do it. However, we get back, you know, the next day, and I continue the same routine. I'm just— she's not feeling well, he's a baby, so I'm taking care of everyone, right? And then my wife is sleeping the whole day. She wakes up, she's kind of grumpy, right? And she just starts complaining, and she's like, you know, like, I can't believe that when we were at the airport, the they were calling our names, you were on the phone and didn't hear it. Like, how incapable are you? Like, that's so incapable. And I'm like, excuse me, like, I arranged this entire thing. And I did all this stuff. And I did it all with good intention and a smile on my face. I didn't have the feeling, maybe subconsciously a little bit, but consciously, I wasn't thinking, oh, I'm gonna do this so my wife doesn't nag me. I was doing it because I love them. That was my main feeling. Maybe there's a tiny bit of, you know, make wife happy so she's not upset. But there's a little bit of that there. But the primary feeling when I was doing it was kind of like a joyful helping, you know, etc. But then when she said that, It like was really hurtful because it was like so invalidating of all the work I did. And then it's like, why even, why even help you anymore? You know, like, she's your, she's your.

**Speaker A:** She'S your best teacher. She's your best Zen master. Because what you're describing is the story of Milarepa. Narpa the translator had him build this giant tower out of stone. And as soon as he was done, his teacher said, "MiloRipa, can you take down that whole tower? I don't like the stones at the bottom. We have to use different stones." "Okay, teacher." Built the whole tower again. Took him days. "Okay, teacher, I built the tower." "I don't like it." 30, 40 times he did this. And you could see this tower in, I think in Nepal, they still have this. But that's not a rare story amongst the Buddhist community. All these teachers, they give you something and they take it away. Just at your moment of happiness, they hit you with the stick on the head because they're teaching you you're relying too much on outer circumstances, on— you're relying too much on Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat to fulfill your void, to make you happy. Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat will never make you happy. You need to be the Sukkha. You need to change the Dukkha into Sukkha. Not building the tower is going to do that. Not fixing everything for your family perfectly is not going to do that. So your wife is actually— if you just change, remember to look and change your thinking a bit with some wholesome thoughts, change it from the nagging wife to the perfect Zen master. That's what she's teaching. Yeah, that's what she'll continue to teach you, and she's going to keep teaching you until you learn that lesson.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a good— it's a really— it's a great thing to keep in mind, and it's really hard because she can just be so brutal with me sometimes. And, you know, and I think like, yeah, and it's like, you know, and I just feel like I'm sometimes like— I've felt Like, I've tried being really nice with her for a long time, and I've noticed myself recently been trying to put up boundaries, like, hey, like, please don't talk to me like that, you know, don't, you know, say that, don't do that, you know. And then she goes more worse, you know, more explosive, you know. And it's so hard, you know, like, I just, you know, and it's like this is like a constant recurring thing. I never know when she's gonna blow up. And like, part of me just, you know, and I don't know if this should even be on the recording, but yeah, you know, like, is it okay if we delete the recording? You know, I mean, I guess if it's on, maybe it can help someone.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Pretty awesome so far, but yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I mean, it'll probably help some people.

**Speaker B:** But, um, I'm sure it would. Yeah, you know, and You know, and it's just I really want to just run away sometimes, you know, like a lot of the time. Everybody, and I— yeah, right. And like, I know I have my obligations to my child, you know, to her, you know, etc. But, you know, sometimes I just think, you know, let's just get a divorce, be co-parents, you know, and I go every day to see my son. And I support financially, no problems. And then no more nagging wife, like 24/7, like maybe a little bit. She'd always be part of my life till my son grows up.

**Speaker A:** The grass is always greener, my friend. You know how many single bachelor people I know that have the same— they have the opposite problem of you. If I only had a nagging wife, and a child. That would make my life so much better. No, they spend their whole life looking for Mrs. Perfect that doesn't exist. They spend their whole life looking for a perfect life that doesn't exist. If you're single, you're, you're gonna have, oh, I'm in Australia, I wish I was in Tahiti, Australia is so hot, this is so awful. Oh, it's never going to end. Honestly, you should be thankful that she's like that because she's making you mindful. You're never going to change her. Sure, on some level you might be able to talk some sense into her once in a while, but you're never going to change. It's not about her, ironically.

**Speaker B:** It's.

**Speaker A:** About you. You want to cast off your problems onto this person, this person, this situation. No, it's not me, it's this situation. It's always us. It always comes down to us, and we either take the time to buckle down and practice, or we continue being carried away by the ups and downs and the whims of life and all the pressures it throws at us.

**Speaker B:** It's our choice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, each moment there's a choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker C:** I have a question about the Milarepa story. So how did that story end?

**Speaker B:** When was the master, you know, you know, how did that— I think It.

**Speaker A:** Ended with Milarepa in tears. Really? Because he built this tower like 30, 40 times and he just finally was covered in blood. He was covered in blood and bruises and just crying. And then Milarepa, he just said, "Master, I just can't do this anymore." And I think he asked him one more time to build it. And he basically broke his spirit so much to the point where he just— he realized that the material world was not going to fix him. No matter how many times he built this perfect tower, no matter how many times he tore it down, it wasn't the point. It wasn't about the tower. It was about changing himself, changing his own mind. His teacher was showing him, what do you think's out there? There's just this. Well, you're going to build a tower and the rainbows are going to come and give you enlightenment? No, there's just this, you know. Everybody has their own Milarepa tower in their life. It could be a very aggressive Zen master. It could be a wife. It could be a bill they have to pay. It could be a boss at their job. Everybody's— and you think, oh, I'll go to a monastery and that will take care of everything. Then you have an abbot there who's up your ass, or the boredom will just drive you insane, and then all of a sudden you want to leave and go to another wat. For what? It's just going to be— wherever we go, we have to take our mind with us. That's.

**Speaker B:** The point.

**Speaker A:** Whoever is our teacher, whatever environment we're in, our mind is going to be right there with us. So we either change this, but if you spend your lifetime trying to change life make it how you want to make it, it's a fool's battle.

**Speaker B:** It's not— you're not gonna work. It's not gonna work. That's what I've been trying to do, you know, the whole, you know, last 9 months, you know, since my— you.

**Speaker A:** Know, that whole story you told us of the whole airport story, never once did you mention in the story, you know, and when we got on the plane, I thought to myself, I'm really glad that I have two legs. To walk through all these airports.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm really glad.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm really glad that my child is healthy and not on a heart monitor right now. I'm really glad, yeah, that I— that my wife is so beautiful and not hideously ugly. I'm really glad that the sun is shining and I'm breathing fresh air and not breathing in toxic fumes. There's a myriad of things to be grateful for. Yeah, right. We don't see it. We only see this negative because of our Samsara, these bad habits, these bad Kammas. And these negative Kammas produce.

**Speaker C:** Negative results. Yeah, you're totally right, man.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, bad results. But the good habits will build momentum and they'll produce good results, and your life will become easier. Your wife will become more even appealing than she already is. Your child— it's such a pleasure to raise.

**Speaker B:** A child.

**Speaker C:** It's really a great time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Jordan Peterson said there's nobody on earth you'll ever meet that will want to be friends with you as much as your child, that will respect you and look up to you as much as your child.

**Speaker C:** Whatever you say, that almost makes me want to cry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, and this is a great thing to be thankful for, and you can use it anytime you wish, here and now. And one day you're going to be an old man, and because you didn't leave your family, because you actually learned to calm your own mind, you're going to have a man there standing there looking at you like you're God, and that's.

**Speaker C:** Your son. That's great. I mean, honestly I teared up a little bit, like it made me think about like this morning. So I managed to sleep in a lot yesterday for various reasons. I usually don't sleep that much, but last night I was able to, or the night before last, right? And so because of that, I was up all night last night. I was planning on going to bed, turned out the dog diarrhea all over the bathroom. So I spend— when I was going to go to bed, I spent an hour and a half cleaning all that up.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker C:** Then, you know, then everybody starts— my wife and son start getting up, you know, and we have a nanny that comes to help and stuff, right? And she's there, you know, and everyone's just starting gearing up, and I, you know, have my energy drinks and stuff, and Like, okay, let's keep going. Not gonna go now, right?

**Speaker B:** And my son is sitting there.

**Speaker C:** And so first my son got up to go and he's with the nanny, right? And he's in his little high chair and she's feeding him, you know? And I was like on the couch.

**Speaker B:** I'm on the couch here, the high.

**Speaker C:** Chair'S here, you know, or like this, you know?

**Speaker B:** And she's feeding him, right? And I'm like playing my video game and I'm also looking at him and I'm talking to him and stuff. I'm going back and forth, you know.

**Speaker C:** And he's just looking at me with this big smile like he just, you know, really wanted me. He just really wanted to talk, engage with me and talk with me, and, you know, it's just great.

**Speaker A:** And like, the kingdom of heaven is yours, man.

**Speaker C:** No, it's just great. And honestly, like, uh, Like, when he was done eating, right? Like, you know, the nanny is kind.

**Speaker B:** Of with him, right?

**Speaker C:** And I'm like, no, enough with the nanny. I'm going to spend time with my son right now, right?

**Speaker B:** Like, enough, you know, don't take time.

**Speaker C:** From me with my son. I didn't say— I'm just kind of thinking that a little bit, right? I go over and I'm— and I just, you know, pick him, and like.

**Speaker B:** He'S crying with her, and then I.

**Speaker C:** Pick him up and he's happy. And that has happened so many times. Like my wife's aunt was over, he's crying with her, and then Daddy shows up and he's happy. Of course, he's calm, you know. And yeah, it's such a great feeling, you know. I've never felt that before.

**Speaker A:** I'm almost 40. I'm almost 40 years old. I'm 39, and I could still remember the feeling of being a tiny kid and having my dad lift me up and hugging me. And it's like, it's all you need in life is love. All you need is that compassion, that acceptance, that nurturing. And we can give it not only to our children, we can give it.

**Speaker C:** To ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** For sure. It's the best. It's the best. Yeah, man. It's what it's all about. It's why we have these meetings, why we meet up, is because we all feel like the world's crushing us sometimes. I'm sure DJ does. I'm sure all of us do. And if I didn't have the Dharma, I'd probably be dead somewhere. I'd probably be a drug addict somewhere.

**Speaker D:** You know, it's funny talking about the crushing thing. I thought, you know, because while I was hearing you and I was coming back to the conversation and listening and all that, but there was moments where I was like, did I go off too far when I was talking about nothing beats nirvana or Nibbana? You know, and I was like, no, that's a little bit too self-critical. But you know what, there's a degree of this where I had a moment there, I was listening to the conversation where I was like, there's something weird where I can almost enjoy a little bit of shame because it keeps me, it keeps me in a certain way, even though it might not have actually offended anyone. But internally, I was like, I might have had a little bit too much of a pity party, not a pity party, but a pity party, because I was like, yes, you know, because I just wanted to nail in that point of like, you know, coming from that place, you can, yeah, make everything like, yeah, just cultivation and development to really improve, you know, your life and the lives of others. And you can— what could be really good is like, you know, if you do go and practice on Anapanasati, bring to mind like, hey, I'm doing this for my son, you know what I mean? I can do this for my son so I can come back and just like keep— you know what I mean? Like that sort of thing. These can all be like, especially when we dedicate our practice like in a selfless way, it really does help to motivate us to you know, move forward in that way while coming back right, you know, to what is available here. But it's like, though, there's skill development, and it's really relieving, you know. So it's really good to see, you know, you on here, Robert, and I'm so glad to see you, Dhamma Das, just giving out that good Dhamma. And just again, it's all about supporting each other and being like, hey, you know what, you're a champion, you can do I can do this, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you get— yeah, yeah. Our biggest problems, our biggest challenges are our best teachers. Yeah, that's what it's all about. We find heaven in hell. We turn hell into heaven. You don't— that's what Jesus said, the kingdom of heaven is within you. All the Christians are looking to the 'Oh, when I die, metaphysics, I'll go to—' No, that's not what he's talking about. The Kingdom of Heaven, you see it in your child's eyes. You see it in your heart. You see it in your compassion and your selflessness. That's the Kingdom of Heaven, here and now. And that's why it's so amazing, because you don't have to wait to get it like everything else in life.

**Speaker B:** It's available.

**Speaker A:** You could go pick up your son anytime you wish. Yeah, go hug your wife anytime you wish. You can go spread the Dharma to somebody if they're willing to hear it anytime you wish.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, just this, just this is successful enough. Like drilling that in of just this, you know, taking care of your son, doing the tiniest mundane tasks, coming back because that's much more reliable. And so you can generate that joy that's not so dependent on very specific things, but just more what's available easily here and now. Like you were saying, Dhamma, Dharma, like on the plane, just being grateful for having legs. Or like, that's why coming back to the breath is very helpful, just being like, oh, I'm breathing right now. It's really nice to, you know, one.

**Speaker A:** Day we'll all be— we'll all be dead. That's true. And you're going to have a very wonderful young man walking around the planet who's spreading the Dharma that his father taught him. What could be better than that? And he's going to teach your grandchildren that, and your grandchildren aren't going to grow up in an alcoholic, abusive household. They're going to grow up in a loving house because of some man, you who had the courage to follow the Dharma.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what else is there.

**Speaker B:** That's awesome.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, nothing better than that, you know.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, well, on that note, guys, I got— I gotta get going, but go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Oh, uh, Dhammarato, really quick, can we like just talk one-on-one sometimes? That you're a lot farther on this journey. That would be great. That would be so helpful. Like, I feel like Like, I have friends and family that are around my age, they're dads, you know, but like Dhamma dad, you know, that's a new, you know, I think that's a great group to exist. There should be some Dhamma dad group out there because honestly, like, I'm like totally serious, like the whole, that particular, we all have our challenges, you know, in life, you know, whatever it is. You know, each challenge is kind of different, you know, like there's Dhamma for Women is I think the new group Dhammarato's, you know, Dr. Susan, I think is working on that. But I feel like if there was like a Dhamma Dad group, that would be great. But in the meantime, if I can just talk with you about that, that.

**Speaker A:** Would be really helpful. Whenever you wish, dude. Whenever you wish. I've gone through things with my kids. My son has had, when he gets seizures, when he gets high temperature when he gets sick, he gets seizures. And all these crazy things happen within autism. And it's always comforting to know that somebody else has been there, maybe in a slightly different style and way. But yeah, I've been there, man. I've been wanting to leave sometimes myself, but we hang in there, you know, and thank God. Like I said, thank God for the Dhamma, dude.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, for sure. I mean, honestly, like, I would say, like, one reason I have hung in there as much, as long as I have, is the Sila, you know. That's been my main thing. Like, I even said this to Dhammarato, like, last week or something. I sent him a little message, you know, because I've been really, really in, like, this turtle mode. I've been in this really self-protective mode. Well, I've been going through this whole thing with my wife, with my dad, his health issue, which is requiring me to travel a lot, you know, which is hard on her, hard on my son, etc. But I can't just let him die, you know, it's like a whole, you know, I want him to be well too. I want them to be well, really hard stuff, you know what, and everyone is, you know, like, it doesn't matter. But, you know, and so like, one thing that has kept me from you know, like saying screw this, I'm just gonna go to, you know, you know, like the Bahamas or some, some crap like that, you know.

**Speaker B:** I'm just gonna like go somewhere else.

**Speaker C:** And just forget all these people and all these obligations and just nope out.

**Speaker B:** Of here, like is the Sila, you know. Yeah, like, and that Sila of like we gotta stay moral, keep with our obligations.

**Speaker C:** And I wish I was practicing Sila more joyfully and in a nurturing way instead of an urgent way. Like, the urgency has not been good for me, but the— or the pressure way. But that's been like the one part of the practice the last several months that I have kept is the Sila, you know. And the other stuff, the you know, the meditation, the mindfulness, the breathing, the Four Noble Truths, all these things, you know, not so much, you know, but the Sila, like, I've really like been.

**Speaker B:** Like, do no harm, do your best, you know, compassion as much as you.

**Speaker C:** Can, like, do no harm, do your best. That's been kind of my guiding light. And so, but now I need to nurture myself more and Yeah, I would really— that would be so great. Give yourself— give yourself— family, parenting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, give yourself a pat on the back that you kept the Sila. Yeah, not many people do keep that.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Well, I will definitely— we'll definitely talk, man. Yeah, reach out to me on Skype or Discord or wherever, wherever you can find me, and then, uh, yeah, we'll talk whenever you want, man.

**Speaker C:** I'm always— that would be so— that would be so helpful. Thank you so much. And DJ also, like, you were really helpful for me today. No, he's really great. Like, I called DJ before this call, like 20 minutes before.

**Speaker B:** Like, I was like, he was like.

**Speaker C:** Hey, you can call me anytime because I was just kind of tipping my toe in the water, right, of the Dharma group again. And he's like, call me anytime. I was like, oh, how about now?

**Speaker B:** And he's like, okay.

**Speaker C:** And then we talk and I just like listen to me vent for like 10 minutes. And, you know, I don't think it's that fun to just listen to people vent. He's the best people like, and he was just great. He was really helpful and kind and great wisdom, Dhamma. And it was really nice.

**Speaker A:** You guys are awesome. Pure Dhamma DJ. Whenever I think of him, yeah, I'm like, man, this guy, when I talked to him, he's just pure Dhamma, dude. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thank you. No, thank you. Because you, you helped me so much along the path. And the Sangha has been a blessing. Just being here has— it's beyond words. I cannot describe.

**Speaker A:** I love all you guys. All right, thank you so much for talking.

**Speaker C:** So, so helpful for me. Thank you guys so much.

**Speaker A:** Much peace and love.

**Speaker C:** Talk soon, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Talk soon.

**Speaker C:** Absolutely. Thank you guys so much. All right, cheers.

**Speaker B:** Cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends DJ (Speaker D), Robert (Speaker B), and others, revolves around the challenges of maintaining a consistent practice, the non-sectarian essence of Dharma, and applying Buddhist teachings to everyday life pressures. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Themes of the Talk**

1. **The Cyclical Nature of Practice**
   - **Robert** shares his personal struggle with falling "off the wagon" of diligent practice due to life challenges (fatherhood, family health issues, marital stress). He expresses feeling demoralized compared to idealized linear narratives of Buddhist masters.
   - **Dhammarato** and **DJ** normalize this experience, emphasizing that the path isn't linear. They reframe "leaving" as a natural part of the human journey, noting that the Dharma is always accessible and that "coming back" is what matters.

2. **Non-Sectarian Dharma & Universal Techniques**
   - **DJ** discusses the documentary on Chan Master Sheng Yen, highlighting how different Buddhist traditions (Chan, Zen, Pure Land, Theravada) all point toward the same goal: freedom from dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).
   - The group agrees that effective Dharma practice transcends sectarian boundaries. Techniques like Pure Land chanting or Theravada mindfulness are different skillful means to "gladden the mind" and cultivate trust in the Dharma.

3. **Buddhism as a Practical Psychology**
   - The discussion contrasts Buddhism with theistic religions (Judaism, Christianity), framing it as a "cheerful nihilism" or "wise selfishness." The focus is on empirical investigation: if you want to end suffering, here is a path you can verify for yourself.
   - **Dhammarato** stresses that Buddhism is not about appeasing a deity or following rigid moral laws from above, but about understanding cause and effect (*kamma*) in one's own mind and life.

4. **Demystifying the "Perfect Master"**
   - The group critiques the Western archetype of the always-perfect, serene spiritual master. They note that even the Buddha faced temptation and physical pain, but his wisdom lay in recognizing and transforming it in the moment.
   - **Robert** finds relief in this perspective, as it makes the path feel more accessible and human.

5. **The Core Practice: Transforming *Dukkha* to *Sukkha* Here and Now**
   - The central practical teaching reiterated throughout is the moment-to-moment work of the mind:
     - **Remember to look**: Check in with yourself throughout the day.
     - **Identify dissatisfaction**: Notice subtle *dukkha*.
     - **Change the mind**: Use inner/outer speech and right effort to replace unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones (e.g., gratitude, self-compassion).
     - **Gladden the mind**: Cultivate *piti* (joy/rapture) and confidence by congratulating yourself for this shift.
   - This process is framed as simple, always available, and more reliable than seeking happiness in external conditions.

6. **Life's Pressures as the Greatest Dharma Teachers**
   - **Robert's** detailed story about his stressful travel experience and his wife's criticism becomes a central case study.
   - **Dhammarato** reframes his wife not as a problem, but as his "best Zen master," akin to Milarepa's teacher who assigned impossible tasks to break his attachment to external results. The lesson: we cannot change others or perfect external conditions; we can only change our mind's relationship to them.
   - The group encourages seeing challenges (a crying baby, a critical spouse, financial pressure) as "bells of mindfulness" that wake us up to practice.

7. **The Role of *Sīla* (Morality) and Nurturing**
   - **Robert** reveals that while his meditation practice lapsed, he held onto *sīla* (ethical conduct) as a lifeline—doing his best to be compassionate and fulfill his duties as a father and son.
   - The group praises this and emphasizes that *sīla* is the foundation. The next step is to move from a pressured, urgent practice of morality to a joyful, self-nurturing one.
   - **Dhammarato** shares his own experience as a father of a child with autism, modeling how to find gratitude and "heaven" within difficult circumstances.

### **Key Takeaways & Advice Offered**

*   **For the "On-again, Off-again" Practitioner:** Your journey is normal. The path is not about never faltering, but about continually "starting again." Trust that the Dharma is always there.
*   **For Dealing with Criticism & Pressure:** See difficult people and situations as your most potent teachers. They show you where you are still seeking validation or peace from the outside world. Your task is to generate inner peace regardless.
*   **For Overwhelming Responsibilities (e.g., Parenthood):** Do not neglect self-nurturing. The practice of gladdening your own mind is not selfish; it gives you the stability and joy needed to care for others effectively. Find moments of gratitude (e.g., a child's smile, the ability to walk) to break the spell of pressure.
*   **On Doctrinal Differences:** Don't get lost in sectarian debates. Focus on the universal core: the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as a practical guide to end suffering *now*.
*   **Final Encouragement:** You are not alone. The Sangha exists for support. The simple practice of checking your mind and choosing wholesome thoughts is a superpower available to anyone, anywhere. "Just chilling out" — the peace of *nibbāna* — is the ultimate success, and it is better than any worldly achievement.

The talk concludes with a sense of warmth and mutual support, highlighting the Sangha's role as a refuge where practitioners can be honest about their struggles and receive practical, compassionate wisdom rooted in the Buddha's core teachings.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Wagon / Falling Off & Getting Back On:** Used repeatedly (especially by Robert/Speaker B) to describe the cyclical nature of practice—periods of diligent engagement followed by periods of withdrawal or struggle.
    *   *Example:* "I fall off the path... getting back on the horse is pretty challenging."

2.  **The Gym Habit:** A direct comparison to make the "wagon" metaphor more relatable, illustrating how consistency builds momentum and how hard it is to restart after a break.
    *   *Example:* "Kind of like going to the gym... it gets easier and easier... But then if you stop... it gets hard to get back."

3.  **Cleaning Glasses / Seeing the Road Clearly:** Used by Dhamma Dassa (Speaker A) to describe the purpose of practice—not to attain something new, but to clarify perception of an ever-present reality.
    *   *Example:* "We happen to get on certain roads that allow us to clear off our glasses and see the road more clearly."

4.  **Swimming in Enlightenment:** A metaphor for our inherent nature, suggesting enlightenment is not a distant goal but the medium we exist within, obscured by delusion.
    *   *Example:* "We never really end up leaving the path because we're all swimming in enlightenment."

5.  **The Dukkha Snake:** Used to describe how the pursuit of sense pleasure is just the opposite side of the same coin as suffering, not a true solution.
    *   *Example:* "I don't want the temporary sense pleasure, it's just the other tail end of the same Dukkha snake."

6.  **The Apple (Incremental Change):** Used to challenge the binary idea of being "on" or "off" the path, suggesting practice is a continuous process of incremental change.
    *   *Example:* "If you take an apple... and you keep taking a small amount. At what time does it cease to be an apple?"

7.  **Waves in the Ocean:** Implies that ups and downs (like a master's journey) are natural, inherent, and not a sign of failure.
    *   *Example:* "Is there waves in the ocean? Is there masters who haven't gone up and down?"

8.  **The Bell (at a Zen Monastery):** Framing life's pressures and suffering not as pure obstacles, but as calls to mindfulness and wake-up calls.
    *   *Example:* "All those pressures... are kind of like the bell that's rung at like a Zen monastery... to wake up and remember to look."

9.  **Burning Through Traumas with Light:** DJ (Speaker D) uses this to describe how mindful awareness ("the illuminating light of wisdom") processes and dissolves past conditioning, contrasting it with repression.
    *   *Example:* "This actually allows you to burn through your traumas with this illuminating light of wisdom."

### **Stories & Parables**

1.  **The Documentary on Master Sheng Yen:** The catalyst for the discussion. DJ summarizes the story, highlighting the master's forced disrobement, dedication, and simple life (e.g., his goal in America being "let's get a bagel"). This story embodies dedication and the essence of practice in everyday life.

2.  **Ajahn Chah's Bowl of Rice:** Told by Dhamma Dassa to illustrate supreme contentment and the end of craving.
    *   *Example:* "When he would wake up, if he had his bowl of rice for the day and his water... he said, 'Oh, all my problems are taken care of.'"

3.  **The Buddha's Journey:** Referenced by Robert as the archetypal "roundabout" path involving false starts (asceticism) before finding the Middle Way. Dhamma Dassa reframes it, suggesting the Buddha "did all the really dirty work for us," leaving the refined teachings as a "beautiful gift."

4.  **Milarepa and the Stone Tower:** Told by Dhamma Dassa in response to Robert's marital struggles. It's a parable about non-attachment to outcomes and how a teacher (or life's difficulties) destroys egoic projects to reveal that happiness isn't found in external achievements.
    *   *Example:* The master makes Milarepa build and tear down a tower repeatedly to break his reliance on the material world and force an inner change.

5.  **Daniel Ingram and The Dark Night of the Soul:** Mentioned by Robert as a counter-narrative to the "perfect master" archetype. Ingram's popularity is attributed to his openness about the difficulties, setbacks, and "falling off" that are part of the path.

6.  **Anecdote from Zen Mountain Monastery:** Robert shares this to deconstruct the "master" archetype, quoting a senior monk who said of the abbot, "even Shugen is just a guy, and sometimes he has some rough edges."

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks (that function metaphorically)**

*   **Cheerful / Wise Selfishness:** A provocative re-framing (by Robert and Speaker C) of the Buddhist path as a pragmatic, personally beneficial system without an external judge or cosmic reward, contrasted with Abrahamic religions.
*   **The Race / Mountain Climbing:** Used to critique the Western, goal-oriented mindset that people import into spiritual practice, which is at odds with the "here and now" focus of the Dhamma.
*   **Nurturing the Inner Child:** A psychological metaphor underpinning the practice of self-compassion and gladdening the mind, presented as the antidote to conditional love and pressure learned in childhood.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of Buddhism as an accessible, non-linear, and deeply personal path focused on present-moment awareness, self-compassion, and finding freedom within life's inevitable challenges, rather than adhering to a perfect linear narrative of achievement.
