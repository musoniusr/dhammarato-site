### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hi guys.

**Speaker B:** Hey, how's it going, Carl? Are there any questions?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have kind of a question and kind of a practice update.

**Speaker B:** Go for it.

**Speaker C:** So I feel like the distance between me being glad and me being, me being like satisfied and me being happy is like getting, getting bigger. So like I can be satisfied without feeling joy and Piti and stuff. And so I can just be satisfied but without like all the positive emotions on top. And sometimes I feel like I'm more satisfied when I'm kind of like depressed, just because it's less effort than like— because it takes like a little bit of effort in order to generate like the happy sensations and positive emotions.

**Speaker D:** I've heard— I'm kind of wondering before from you, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Oh God, am I allowed to like suffer if I'm more satisfied? Because it's less effort. Because it takes like a couple, it takes like a couple of seconds or a couple of minutes of effort.

**Speaker E:** You don't need to suffer. You don't need to ask permission.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think you're a little bit confused about what being satisfied is. Because if you're suffering, then you're not satisfied.

**Speaker C:** You're saying like, oh, I'm satisfied, but I am at the same time. I'm more satisfied than I would be if I exerted effort to try and make myself feel happy.

**Speaker B:** No, that's not how it works. You're either satisfied or not.

**Speaker D:** Okay, well, so do I just keep grinding until— I don't think you need to put so much effort in, but I remember you asked the same thing like 3 or 4 weeks ago.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Look at you, Joe, reviewing the minutes.

**Speaker C:** My practice kind of goes around in circles where I have the same issue and then the issues rotate.

**Speaker D:** It's good when you can see that though, right? Like when you can see that it's like, oh, it's kind of the same thing. Like, I'm familiar with this one. And then you see those thoughts and you see that thought 'Oh, I prefer depression to being happy,' and you say it to yourself again. And that's why I'm laughing, because I'm just like, there's no way that's right, you know? Like, even if you think that you're like, 'I'm okay with being depressed,' I agree with Scott that like, yeah, it's— yeah.

**Speaker C:** Well, if you're— when I gladden the mind, it makes me, it makes me like suffer more because I have to like suppress my hindrances and like chuckle.

**Speaker D:** Well, then you're not gladdening your mind, I can tell you that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And also I would say, yeah, you got this reversed, dude. If you're happily depressed, how are you depressed? That you're depressed, if you're happily depressed. Right.

**Speaker C:** Because I'm just like, okay, with the fact that I'm depressed. I'm like depressed, but like, I'm not like resisting being depressed. I'm just kind of like depressed.

**Speaker E:** It sounds like resignation. Like, I would categorize that a bit as resignation. Non-happiness, you know. Yeah, like that's different.

**Speaker C:** Giving up.

**Speaker E:** Exactly. You're giving up, but it's not the same as letting go.

**Speaker A:** You kind of just say, I want to take a break. I want to take a break. So you fall back to your old, old habit of just reacting how you like to react, being a victim and being sad. So you constantly just fall back into that loop because you want to take a break from practice, as you said. Gladdening the mind feels tiring, right? Yeah, because you're trying to gladden the mind when it doesn't need to be gladdened. As far as like, you're looking for Dukkha when there's no Dukkha. That's what happens to me when I look for Dukkha when there's no Dukkha. You're gonna be like, oh, I'm so tired of this. I just want to give up. And you feel so sad because there's no Dukkha. You can't find anything. I cannot find anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, that's exactly right. If you look for Dukkha when there's no Dukkha, you're just gonna find Dukkha. Yeah, you'll find what you're looking for.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, right. The very act of looking is like craving, and that starts it up again. That starts it up again. That's right.

**Speaker A:** And it all originates from that one thing of like, as Dhammarato explains, the Western mindset that this is some kind of goal, there's an end finish, and you're craving to finish this task of gladdening the mind or achieving something, achieving some kind of state. So that's where that kind of arises from, I find in myself at least.

**Speaker C:** But if I don't, I still feel like a bit like like a dull kind of sadness, like a dull depression kind of broke a bit.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the Dukkha then.

**Speaker C:** So how do I chuck that out without making like more effort to check it out?

**Speaker A:** Relax. Just relax. What I do in those situations, I try to stop the world. I will relax and I will look at my body, I will look at my images, I will look at everything, and I will literally do everything super slowly. It seems to me at least, but I'm doing a normal speed. I'll be like picking up a cup and then taking a sip really slowly, like slow yourself.

**Speaker C:** So like your whole body is just relaxed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And then you're gonna come back. That's really helpful, slowing yourself.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I can feel kind of how much like more relaxing that is. I just reach my day and pick it up and it's like a more relaxing also. So do I just wait for it to go away? And like, for depression and stuff, I just relax and just wait for it to go away?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I also think I have like something related. I had this note today. I mean, it's related to you, I think, Robert, as well, because I've noticed that sadness comes and you think, I'm okay being sad, But it's probably because you're not finding Dukkha as much in thoughts, but you can still visualize Dukkha. I found out that thoughts can work as far as like visualization. So sometimes you're not finding anything in like language sense, but you might be visualizing without a language if you have that like kind of— some people are more like visual beings, so they can visualize their thoughts more and they don't even notice that they're visualizing their thoughts without any language. So you're actually creating Dukkha visually for yourself, but you're not noticing the words.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because I'm not thinking it in words.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you're not finding anything in the words, but maybe there's something in your visual, in your body, in your senses. It's just more investigation, at least what worked for me.

**Speaker C:** I see. So I should— it's like, oh, I'm not having unwholesome thoughts, but the verbal— I should still look to see if there's something unwholesome there isn't verbal, like a visualization or like a bodily sensation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just slow yourself down and, and try to, to try to relax. Not try to, just relax.

**Speaker E:** Trying would be like, okay, and now, now I'm gonna relax.

**Speaker A:** I'm gonna try.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just that, just like let my mind go to where I believe, like let my mind kind of find the details. Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** I hope that helps.

**Speaker A:** I feel like I'm going to take that with me. Sometimes I find myself in that sadness as well, so I've been investigating it more and more and more and more because I think, oh, I like being sad as well. Sometimes I'm like, no, don't go there. That's dangerous territory, you know. That's a rabbit hole.

**Speaker B:** Well, you can enjoy sadness without suffering. For example, when you watch a movie, there may be very sad moments, but there's no Dukkha there. It's actually beautiful in a way, because you're not attached to— you don't see yourself as a character in the movie. So you can enjoy the full spectrum of human emotions that there is to offer, but there's nobody there to suffer as a result of them. So I could listen to a beautiful touching song and like, and feel moved by that emotion of sadness without becoming miserable and a victim of whatever it is I'm experiencing. The problem isn't the Dukkha. The problem is the victim of the Dukkha is the problem.

**Speaker C:** I see, see. So if I, if I let the dukkha be there and don't create an identity out of the dukkha, like someone who wants to fix the dukkha, is that okay?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, don't create an identity around fixing the dukkha, and don't try to get rid of the dukkha, because that's just more dukkha.

**Speaker C:** Okay, because that's kind of what I've been doing. I've kind of just been like accepting the dukkha and just like not trying to fix it, and just like being. That's what I mean, that I'm like, I'm kind of more satisfied just like accepting the Dukkha and trying to like go through the effort of trying to get rid of it.

**Speaker B:** Perfect.

**Speaker D:** If you— yeah, if you're in, if you're embracing— that's okay then, that's great. You can cry, you can cry, you can cry and smile at the same time, you know?

**Speaker C:** Like, that's— yeah, that's— it's more relaxing to do that. Yeah, it's more like, it's, it's more peaceful.

**Speaker D:** It's less like, oh, poor me, and more like I can see again these patterns and I can see this sort of like this thing, you know, you can step outside of it for a kind of a minute and really see and just embrace what you're feeling, you know, and like it's, yeah, I just, I laugh because it sounds exactly like me so often, you know, like I'm so often in this exact same you know, sort of thought pattern, you know. And, um, you know, and, you know, and then when you're not in it, like, I feel, I feel touched because I'm like, oh, poor Robert. Like, you know, you wish that you could just, like, just give you a hug and, like, be like, it's all right, man, that's fine, you know. Yeah, because you don't have, you don't have to feel like that, you know. Like, I, I know stuff is, like, difficult, but Like, the practice doesn't have to be a new difficulty, you know, that we create for ourselves.

**Speaker C:** Thanks. Yeah, I was asking Scott, like, because sometimes I get really confused with practice because, like, at different times I feel like it's appropriate to do what I'm doing now, where I just, like, I'm okay with the fact I'm suffering. And then other times I feel it's more appropriate to like really put forth the effort and get enthusiastic and bring in that Piti and stuff. And it just kind of feels like appropriate at different times, so it's kind of confusing to know when to do what. And I was asking Scott on Instagram just before the call, like, is like sort of— is like just— is Dukkha, Nirodha, just desire and Nirodha? Is it kind of the same thing?

**Speaker B:** What's the question?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I didn't get the question, sorry.

**Speaker C:** So is dukkha and Nirodha, desire and Nirodha? Does it mean not, it doesn't mean remove desire? So if there's dukkha, we remove the desire to remove the dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Okay, dukkha is suffering. Dukkha Nirodha is the cessation of suffering. Yes, well, I don't understand where that desire comes into that.

**Speaker C:** This desire is the source of suffering.

**Speaker D:** You can have, you can have wholesome desires, like you can have a realistic picture of like where, like where you're at right now, right? Like, yeah, uh, and, and you can have some pretty like, like wholesome desires and just be like, okay, well, I, I can, I I can accept that. Like, for example, a wholesome desire could be something to do with Dhamma, you know? Like, it's okay because we're not perfect, you know, and we never will be. And to try to make these new rules where it's like, I got to get rid of every desire, it's like, I don't know. I mean, get rid of the easy ones, you know, the worldly desires. You know, those ones are pretty easy to get rid of. But some of the other ones, it takes quite a while. And I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Well, did you read what I wrote? Because I responded to this question. I said, when he was asking about desires, I said, it's the desire for truth that is the final desire that quenches all other desires.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker B:** The desire for truth is a good thing because the desire for truth comes from truth itself. Because you wouldn't desire for truth if at some level you didn't already know what it was. Okay, so you couldn't desire for happiness if you've never experienced happiness. It's almost like a gravitational pull of like a returning home to something that you already know at the deepest core of your being what it is. But the desire for that is a turning away from all other desires that can be directed towards an object, or it's not the same in the same way like you crave something, like you crave something in the world, or you fear something that is here. It's a desire for something that transcends ultimately any experience you can have. So that desire is a purely wholesome desire, and that's the reason why we're here. Like, that desire is the reason why we're here talking about this stuff, why we seek out the Dharma. That's why we are in the Sangha. That's why we practice. So that's the only good desire that there is.

**Speaker A:** That's enthusiasm for practice, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** When you say truth, that means just like the present moment, right? Like the way that it is.

**Speaker B:** Truth is the way that things are.

**Speaker C:** So it's okay then to have suffering?

**Speaker B:** I'm hesitant to answer that question because I don't know what you formulate the present moment as. Because even the present moment, if you think of the present moment as like something in between the past and the future, that's still within the linear time. So if you think of the present moment as something that's really small in between all this future and all this past, that's what— that's not what I would call truly the present moment. The present moment contains all— like, time moves within the present moment. Time is like— the present moment is the container of all past, future, and so on. Yeah, the present moment doesn't move through time. Time moves through the present moment.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so I'm not having like— it's not like a concept of the present moment, it's like the real present moment, the reality of the moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay. And that's like, that's just this, right? That's just everything. Did you check out the works of Jed McKenna at any time? Yeah, yeah, I read his first book. Yeah, because I, I was reminded of it because now we, we put the word truth into the whole conversation, and I, from, from what I, from it, from those that, um, is that that's exactly was about. And yes, it's— I think it's quite a nice presentation in there, at least to a point, what kind of can happen if that becomes once you're on the desire.

**Speaker F:** Dag, it was a little hard to hear you. You're breaking up a bit.

**Speaker D:** All right, anything?

**Speaker F:** It's still choppy. Is it choppy for you guys as well? Can you hear him clearly? Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** I think he said something to the extent of, see what happens when the truth is the only thing you desire.

**Speaker F:** It's going to come find you. I think I remember Jed McKenna saying something like that. Eventually the truth comes and finds you.

**Speaker A:** But that happens as you investigate the moment. I mean, it's impossible to run from it as you investigate and you decode remove the layers, you see what the truth is. You might, as soon as another thought comes, you might just go away from it, but you're there for at least a split second when you're investigating, and you finally get there, and then you distract yourself again. You get there and you distract yourself again.

**Speaker D:** That's what continues to happen.

**Speaker C:** Can you hear me better now?

**Speaker A:** Now the microphone is quite noisy, to be honest.

**Speaker D:** Now you're like peaking.

**Speaker C:** Oh man, you're peaking.

**Speaker F:** I think you're— I think you're not choppy though. Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** No, he's choppy.

**Speaker C:** Goddamn it. I don't know if I can fix this problem right now. You try hanging up and then rejoining. That's what Vinayana does in my monk tradition. That works in my last couple of times, just having a way to describe this very accurately.

**Speaker D:** You know, one thing that I like thinking about the present moment is this sort of like math concept of like a graph that is coming all the way down to another point and it never reaches that point where we look really, really closely, but it's actually kind of like impossible to see that point of contact. So it's like, it's something interesting because when we're referring to the present moment, we're actually referring to the contact that happens like an infinitesimally small moment after that, you know.

**Speaker A:** So it seems like you're saying just see the present moment and that was like almost lost, the present moment.

**Speaker D:** What's that, Robert? I'm sorry, Doc, your thing was just so loud. Your microphone is like super peaking. What were you saying, Robert? Yeah, a little bit. But it's like, it's just seeing, like, seeing how it functions, right? Of like seeing how all these things are interrelated, of like, okay, there's this stimulus that comes into my sense consciousness in some way, and that contact sets off the whole line. And these things all kind of arise at exactly the same time over and over and over and over again. You know, and it never stops happening like that, and we keep observing that. And so I'm just saying it because it can be kind of a thing of like, yeah, latching on to the present moment like Scott was saying, when we're not actually really touching our idea of the present moment, you know. I don't know if that's helpful, but it can be maybe too radical.

**Speaker E:** It's not theoretical, it's not conceptual, it's experiential. That's the difference, is it experiential. And you can physically feel, like literally physically feel yourself being carried along as opposed to kind of like thinking of yourself as being in the present moment. It's a different kind of a vibration. I mean, I don't mean to get hippie-dippy with it, but it definitely feels like that.

**Speaker A:** I think the easiest way to experience it is just like take a breath. You will feel it for a split second as you consciously choose to take a breath. The presence that you bring to that breath, you will feel it. And that's your kind of pinpoint of the experience. It's pretty much like that, but without actually having to think, "Oh, I need to take a breath.

**Speaker C:** I need to do this." So I'm not actually asking that as a service.

**Speaker F:** Like, I'm thinking it doesn't matter.

**Speaker D:** It sounds like you're on an alien planet.

**Speaker F:** I was gonna say, am I the only one?

**Speaker D:** I was like, it sounds like he's like a robot right now.

**Speaker A:** I was looking at Alex's face and he just looks like really confused.

**Speaker D:** It's like, what is going on here?

**Speaker A:** I was thinking the same thing.

**Speaker B:** Is it?

**Speaker D:** No, no, no, no.

**Speaker E:** Dragged up to the mothership.

**Speaker F:** Go, go, go, go, go. Guys, something I'd like to share real quick.

**Speaker C:** I gotta go.

**Speaker F:** Is that Robert? You want to test your mic? I was going to share something, but still alien, man.

**Speaker D:** It's probably Anapanasati. We have no idea what you're saying.

**Speaker F:** I was going to say is something I was talking to Scott like a couple minutes ago before we jumped on. And what I noticed is that there's never not seeing happening. Seeing is always happening. It's always present, just like the breath. So what is seeing the observations that are being made from this speech that's coming out of this mouth right here is always present. It's always seeing it, and it can't be pointed to. You can't point to what is seeing. The minute you try to point to it, what you're— what it is that's pointing is seen. So seeing can only see, uh, and the scene comes from what's seeing. So I don't know why that sounds so freaking cool, but it's, it's experiential.

**Speaker E:** It's not reflective. Yeah, it's not reflexive. There's no subject-object. It's just, it's just object. Yeah, yeah, it's just whatever. It's just not It's like that non-duality, right? It's non-duality at this point.

**Speaker A:** It's going by itself.

**Speaker E:** Exactly.

**Speaker F:** Are you talking about the seeing, Rick?

**Speaker E:** Right, I'm saying the seeing is going by itself, but the thinking about the seeing, that becomes a reflexive act.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and in which case then it's no longer— That's seen too.

**Speaker F:** That's seen too though. It's all seen. Just really cool to see that because I like it takes the, at least in this moment, it takes the charge out of unwholesome thoughts, like for sure unwholesome thoughts. It takes the charge out of even just like noticing thinking, like wanting, having a tendency to think badly about mind wandering. It takes the charge out of that too because that's all seen. And if all that stuff is being seen, I don't know, it's just beyond it. It doesn't seem like that's me.

**Speaker E:** I see what you're saying, like there's no need to judge it. There's no need for judgment anymore because it's still just this, like, yeah, no need for the judgment. Yeah, I'm with you on that.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, no need for the judgment. It's just kind of cool to see. It's like, oh wow, that's seen, that's seen, that's seen. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** But as you're seeing, they're saying that's seeing, that's seeing, that's seeing, that's seeing.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it's seeing, it's seeing, it's seeing, it's seeing, it's seeing, it's seeing.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't— it has no end.

**Speaker F:** It has no end. But then I guess that means it also has no beginning. So I suppose it's like either you're seeing the seeing that's going on or you're not, but the seeing is always going on. Just like the breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So the point of like this is to be in the seeing as much as you can because that way you're experiencing fully.

**Speaker F:** And it's really kind of cool because it's like, even if there's like really great joy or spaciousness, right? Like those byproducts that we get, that's all just seen too. So I don't know. I'm going to take my candy and give myself a gold star. Congratulations. And all that was just seen.

**Speaker A:** Like, it doesn't matter. And we're seeing you seeing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** All right, guys. Love you.

**Speaker D:** Got to get back to work.

**Speaker F:** But see you sometime.

**Speaker C:** Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** Bye.

**Speaker D:** Thanks for the insight.

**Speaker C:** It's been good. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Thanks, guys.

**Speaker C:** Guys, is my mic better?

**Speaker B:** Better.

**Speaker E:** It is, it is better.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, success. Awesome. Um, just if you guys would be open to talking about what we talked about before. Um, so the truth is the experience of the present moment. It's not a thought about the present moment, it's not the thought called the present moment, it's the experience of it. And You don't think about experience, you feel experience. Yes, I do.

**Speaker E:** That's right. Yeah, and because we're in such a habit of thinking and reflecting, even instantly after something happens, that we confuse it so quickly, right? And we start putting categories and expectations and judgments and cravings and whatever right in front of it, but it pulls us right out of that present moment truth experience.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So is it wholesome? So if my experience is suffering and that's truth, is it really wholesome? To want to change my experience to be one without suffering? Wouldn't it be more wholesome to accept the suffering that's there?

**Speaker D:** Like, from what I get of your question, I'm just reminded of— I think you might have even mentioned this one, or somebody did— the whole— so you have a choice when you find yourself physically in a situation that is unpleasant. You can either change something if you can change it, or if you can't change it, then you still— then you just don't have to worry about it, right? Because you can't change anything, right? So if you find yourself in that circumstance and you can see there's something that I can change, then just change that, you know? And usually when it comes to thoughts and the mind, there usually is something that we can change, right? And the thing that we're changing is we're changing the way that our minds physically function. We're rewiring our brains and we're rewiring our heart, really. It's the mind-heart sort of thing that we're working on getting more in touch with and getting a little bit away from the other one that you're kind of going with. You know, I don't know if that's helpful.

**Speaker A:** Can I add something to that? So I think when you say you don't want to change the suffering, you feel like accepting it, it comes from the position of sufferer, because the sufferer feels like it's gonna lose. It still comes from a point like you want to be able to feel sadness, you want to be able to feel all emotions. And if you tell yourself it's not okay to feel these emotions, then that part of you has to die off. That part of you, you have to let go. You have to lose the sadness. It's almost— it comes a death of a certain ego, certain spot of the victim, certain spot of the ego. So that's why it's so hard to let go of that part, because it's fear. The fear of it losing itself is gonna manifest as in saying, oh wait, as this thought, oh wait, Am I doing it too hard? Am I supposed to get rid of this Dukkha right now? Because I just want to feel sad. So it's going to contradict itself.

**Speaker E:** Right, and I think you said something really good. You used the words like let go, but if someone's identifying with that desire, then they see it as giving it up rather than letting it go, and it's hard to give something up. It's like trying to quit something that's habitual rather than realizing that you don't need it anymore and you can let it go without a concern, without a worry. But that has to do with a reframe. That's a big habitual reframe to realize that in the end it's not— I would say it isn't worth it. It sounds like a judgment, but it's not worth worth it to be in that perspective. I mean, you can't just change it. You have to work through it a bit. But yeah, it's— yeah, like, to me it feels like letting go and giving up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you're like, oh, I don't want to give this up to change it.

**Speaker E:** You're clinging to something. You're clinging to this identity, as you said, Carl, called sufferer, you know.

**Speaker D:** We do have to put a little bit of effort in and getting the energy built up and the faith really that, hey, this really works. And we're going to have times when we seem to be making progress and then we seem to be back in sort of the same feelings and we're like, wait a minute, I haven't really gotten anywhere because I'm having the same sort of thought patterns. And when we're in those moments, then we really have to like— that's when we really got to practice. Like almost, you know, it's more important because it's like when things are going easy, it's just effortless, right? But like when you find yourself with these sorts of thoughts, these sorts of just kind of ambivalence to the world, that's a really important time, I think, to really practice and to really focus in and be like, I got to get this energy up and nobody's going to come and do it for me. You know, like it's on me. I have this often where I'm sitting there and I'm like, poor me, like who should I call? Who should I talk to? And then the realization hits me, wait a minute, how many times have you heard the whole teachings of the Buddha is there's nobody coming to save you. This is on you, you know. Have you learned how to comfort yourself? Have you learned how to be caring and kind to yourself? And to say these kind things to yourself, you know, and it's not running away.

**Speaker C:** It doesn't feel kind to do that. It doesn't feel kind to force myself to feel good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't force.

**Speaker D:** It's unnatural. You don't force, you know. Yeah, that's the thing.

**Speaker A:** I think Scott put it in the chat. He says like he said the same thing to Alex. You relax into it because what you're experiencing, you're trying to change your experience. You're feeling sadness and you're trying just to layer it more. You're saying, oh, is this Dukkha? I have to get rid of it. So you're already irritated. So what you need to do when you're irritated by that, you might not feel irritated, but you feel sadness and it's manifesting, you need to just relax. Relaxing into it, it will solve itself out.

**Speaker D:** You're picturing a future that is different than your reality of what you're in right now. That's the other thing that for me, what ends up happening is that I'm like, okay, I'm sad right now. And I know if I do this practice, I should get happy. But I'm not actually happy right now. So I'm kind of leaning for something in the future. Yeah, I know how this goes. So if I just take a few deep breaths, I know exactly how I'm going to feel. But you're not actually feeling how you actually feel in that moment, right? So it's like you're kind of telling yourself something that's taking you out of the present. And not getting you in touch with those feelings. And hey, all right, back my old friend sadness.

**Speaker E:** And then when it doesn't work, you're— there's a part of you is like, see, see, it didn't work. I knew it wouldn't work this time. I knew there was something wrong different this time. Yeah, but you've already— it's back to self-fulfilling again. It's back to the self-fulfilling. Let's not forget, doubt is one of the hindrances, right? Doubt. That's one of the big ones. They're all big, but that's a big one.

**Speaker C:** That's one of my biggest ones.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, but you can't, you know, as you said, you can't force it.

**Speaker D:** You can't.

**Speaker E:** I mean, it's difficult. You can do it. You can do it. It's difficult to meditate anger.

**Speaker D:** It's difficult to meditate frustration.

**Speaker G:** I think what might be really helpful too is to recognize just the success for like a moment, like even when it comes to like, say, spotting doubts. So you might be able to spot doubt for a moment and be like, yes, this is successful. I've seen you doubt. And then doubt will come back up. Right. But then it's just spotting it again and then playing off that, you know, success with that. I agree. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Sometimes just naming the hindrance reduces its hold. Just naming reduces the hold a little bit. It doesn't work all the way, but it definitely helps condense it into identifying that and then can work with it rather than just like, like you said, Carl, layering a bunch of extra expectations on it. Like, I shouldn't feel this way, I've been meditating for years. Yeah, I shouldn't be feeling this way.

**Speaker C:** Like, I'm trying so hard to do the technique, it should be working.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But then that's back to expectations again. So yeah, it's good to know note the hindrances as they arise, and then I think it's easier to tangle with something you can understand than it is like, oh, it's this big mass of I don't know what, I just don't want to practice that.

**Speaker A:** I think it's the trap, no? You felt— I would like use this kind of metaphor— you fall into a trap, but you're not recognizing that you're stuck. But when you recognize a hindrance, you're saying, hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, this is doubt. I'm just stuck in a trap. You actually automatically, you know what to do. I need to lift this up. I need to do this. I need to do this to get out of it. So naming it, to recognizing what is that I'm experiencing right now allows you to move past it at least one step, another step, another step. It brings you back, as it is said, to the the moment, at least for a second.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, well, that's right. It's just sometimes for a moment, because it'll go like back and forth, right? Like, so it'll be like, aha, I see you, you know, doubt. And then, okay, cool. And then we get into perhaps, you know, feeling that success, but then the thoughts will come sneaking back in. But oh, I see you doubt again, or whatever has arisen, right? So that's the thing. It's just gonna It'll come back, but it's just when it does, getting those little nuggets of success, and that's enough success to just ride with it and build that confidence in the practice of it. But I do think too, it is a good point that you don't necessarily have to have like the woohoo, like most ecstatic, energetic thing all the time.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker G:** Sometimes moving in because the bodily sensations, right. Perhaps if you are feeling a little bit more sad, you can perhaps move it to mellow and the relaxation and the calm and the Sukkha. And it's okay.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker G:** And that's the thing, right? Even when you're thinking about like being satisfied with this sadness, it's like the one thing is probably happening at a time. You're sad, you're in Dukkha for a bit, and then, oh, there's the satisfaction. I can just, you know, I can just chill with this. And then the sadness and the Dukkha comes back and it'll play back and forth. Right. So that could be something else.

**Speaker C:** I think I know what you mean. Sometimes I'll reach like a lower level of— so a higher level of satisfaction. The sadness will still be there, but it'll be like a shadow of what it once was. It'll be like a shadow of sadness. Like it'll be the sadness, but in like a more, a less intense form.

**Speaker G:** Or it's like, yeah, like the sadness will perhaps go away, but then it'll come resurface back up and then it'll go away and it'll come and surface back up. But yeah, it'll kind of pull perhaps more of the background.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** But then it is, yeah.

**Speaker E:** And I do think that over time, you know, this skillful observation, you know, helps remove yourself, you know, back into the present, back into observation, back into the sounds, all these things. But to layer expectation on it, to say, you know, by a certain amount of time this should have occurred, you know, the skillful that means you end up automatically getting better as you go without concerning yourself with trying. I mean, yeah, I mean, the motivation to improve is of course important, but the idea of, you know, acting like there's these checkpoints— it's like, okay, by this amount of time I should have— or I've reached this height before, why can't I just jump right back? But the skillful means will take care of themselves and it will get easier in any way. Just as a natural way of practice. That's why it's practice. Practicing towards it.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say that.

**Speaker C:** Thanks guys, that's really helpful. There's a lot of information you've shared there. Brilliant. Go on, Joe. Sorry I interrupted.

**Speaker D:** No, that's okay. I was going to say that I find that my thoughts get really, really tricky after a while, after a lot of practice. And it's like no matter how much I practice, I tend to think that there's going to be a time when I can always have this sort of separation and see, oh, this is just a thought, and let go of it as that. But the tricky thing is that the thoughts tend to change. And a lot of them have to do with these sort of ideals, or like, I mean, like many of you, I spend a lot of time watching Dharma talks, and people tend to be at their best when they're talking, or, you know, and I don't really have a realistic picture all the time of the full compass of human experience, you know. And this can be why it's, I think, it's sometimes a little bit difficult with the internet as a Sangha medium, especially because you don't physically see all of us when we're struggling with something, and so you don't see how the person deals with that, what skills. And so we're describing to you what we do and what we have found effective. But, you know, you're kind of maybe— because I know I'm just saying this because I do it— I'm projecting that all of you are just super 100% happy all the time, you know. And I mean, yeah, We've been practicing a really long time too, Rick, so I'm not surprised.

**Speaker E:** Clearly no, clearly no. I'm still existing, which means I'm still suffering. I'm still in some sort of suffering. Yeah, it is. That's interesting what you say. I don't listen to that many Dhamma talks, actually. I take a lot of that time and I practice. Sometimes when I feel the urge to listen to a Dhamma talk, I end up using that time for practice instead. Because that's my personal choice, to try and move along the path in my own way. Of course, Dhamma talks are helpful, they have their time and place, but I found that I benefit more through the actual sitting practice, even if it means, you know, 1 or 2 hours every day. You know, that's a luxury I happen to have, and I'm grateful for that. But, you know, that's the third— I kind of like lean into that direction, practice more than a lot of information gathering, you know.

**Speaker A:** Can I ask you guys a question? When you guys mean practice, for me, I feel like when we say practice, we always imagine this kind of sitting period, or I'm gonna put so much effort right now and I'm gonna just observe myself. But I can't. I find myself, I cannot not practice. It's impossible not to practice. Like, personally, it's impossible not to practice. So it's not like something I have to do, like to sit down and meditate. Even if I go 10 days, 20 days without actually looking at myself, it's impossible not to practice in some sort of way, you know.

**Speaker D:** That's great. I mean, but I think Rick is just saying— he just didn't say it, but he's saying formal practice.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, formal practice.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the benefit of formal practice is that we see our minds quiet down, you know, and that we, we take that period and slow down.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, back to the slow mode rather than rather than real time.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I, I like that.

**Speaker C:** That's a really good point.

**Speaker D:** I think that formal meditation is, is much more— it's been, it's been more effective. I mean, it's when you're sitting there, you know, like, yeah, I think, I think for me sometimes, uh, I find that Dhamma talks and sort of guided meditations and things like this can be helpful for me when I find myself really stuck in the hindrances and really lost. That that's where I'm at, because I spent a lot of time in the past sort of like, like I just, I wanted to sit in silence. I had kind of this idealistic viewpoint of like, you know, from doing Vipassana retreats and things like that. And so I, now I'm a little bit more humble about it for myself. And, and also it's just been, it's been the wintertime and I'm a farmer, so like, you know, I have a ton, I have a ton of time right now. And talk to me in about a month and I'll be like probably not watching so many Dhamma talks. That's how— that's my— that's my schedule, you know. It's— it's just, you know, I have— I have a busy time of the year and I have a really relaxed time of the year, you know.

**Speaker E:** I would like to say something to— that Carl mentioned about the practice throughout the day when you're not just formally sitting. So the last— I don't know, last couple days or last week, I've really noticed how easy it is for my mind to try and jump to like the most enjoyable parts of the day or the parts of the day where I'm not like formally working and trying to like get excited or anticipatory about those moments. But the last week it's been a bit different, and I've been able to kind of notice that anticipation and say, you know, what's wrong with enjoying what you're doing right now? Why are you running to this sort of great, like, free time moment of, oh, I can't wait till I meditate, or I can't wait till I'm done with the work, or I can't wait till I this or that? And wow, I just like, I do it a lot. I do it a lot. I'm running to a next time without really— and then it's been a bit of, it's been about practicing that observation of, oh, look at you anticipating. What's wrong with this moment? What's wrong? Aren't you— don't you have the potential to enjoy this right, what you're doing? And of course, you know, don't you get a charge sometimes when you're teaching? Don't you get a charge sometimes when you're, you know, whatever, you know? And so that's been really— and again, I think that it's the formal practice that's allowed the platform for that kind of observation to take place. And of course, it's still going on. I'm still thinking about a little bit about, okay, now when this happens and, okay, it'll feel better because I won't have these obligations, etc. But it's less because now there's less anticipation. It doesn't feel like, oh, I can't wait, you know, like that little mental thought, I can't wait until, even though it's the same day. I stopped doing that with the weekends a long time ago. I think most people go, oh, I can't wait until Friday. That's a very common thought people have. Is most of the working world. I don't have that one anymore, but these moments of the day, I'm like, oh, I can't wait until— and I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't wait?

**Speaker C:** Really?

**Speaker E:** You can't? Yes, you can enjoy now. Do you have to wait? Do you have to wait at all? Like that. So that's, I don't know, it's an observation I wanted to share with everybody that was kind of a nice little breakthrough I felt this week.

**Speaker B:** That's a little Awesome.

**Speaker D:** That's great. That's brilliant. That sounds really healthy. Thanks. Sometimes I have related to that, I get the shoulds a little bit where I'm doing something that I find a little bit unpleasant and I'm like, I should enjoy this. Like, I'm a practitioner, I should be able to enjoy myself right now instead of actually enjoying myself. When I catch myself, I'm like, okay, I can enjoy this too. You know, my usual one is doing the laundry, you know, where I'm like, what is so unpleasant about like the clothes being a little bit cold and wet? Like, this is so crazy.

**Speaker E:** And that's when I put on the music and I'm like, I can do something pleasant, have some pleasant stimulus while I'm doing something that I would normally categorize as unpleasant. I do that a lot when I'm cleaning, for example. I put on some lo-fi or some nice instrumental from Final Fantasy or something, and I don't mind dusting. I'm like, oh, it's cool. I have an excuse to listen to music and I have an excuse to enjoy dusting or whatever crap I don't like to do normally.

**Speaker D:** That's such a good subject. Robert, your microphone sounds like an alien again.

**Speaker E:** You're back in the mothership. Yeah, that's Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** I noticed that as well, as you said, anticipating the next part of the day, especially like recently I've been having this moment of, I don't know why, Dhammarato's way, wakey wakey, every time I'm anticipating something, this voice in my head, wakey wakey, look what you're doing. I'm cycling from work home today and I'm already planning, I'm gonna cook this, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna do this. I'm like, wakey wakey, look where you're going.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it doesn't even have to be like clear and present possible danger, it's just I told you, I think I mentioned in an earlier chat, I can feel sometimes my heart speeding up when I start anticipating the future too much. It's like a physical response to, oh, I can't wait. That's stopped a little bit, thankfully.

**Speaker A:** That's like a dog wiggling his tail.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, kind of like, oh, but now I'm just noticing the thought before it gets to be a physical sensation. So more or less, not always, but more or less.

**Speaker B:** More or less. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** What I'm noticing too for myself recently is that I have a lot of standards related to like how much like work I get done and what I classify as like as work. And so like if I've been a good boy and I do my 8 hours or whatever in the day, then all of a sudden I'm like, oh, good job. Now you can really be satisfied. But even there, sometimes I catch it in my mind where it's like, but you didn't work totally hard enough, you know, like you didn't do it. And then sometimes I just like, I won't classify something as work where I'm like, okay, well, I have to do this, but it doesn't count because like, I'm not actually making money doing this. And like, that can't count as work, even though I'm only one person. And like, and it's setting like unrealistic expectations. And this is kind of natural, I think, when you're working for yourself. And there's more things than you can ever get done that you're just like, that it's some sort of weird reaction where you're like never satisfied with the amount of work that you do and you get really disappointed with yourself if you're like having a day where you just like failed or whatever, where you know, where you're just like, today I just, I can't do it. I don't have the, I don't have the energy and it's raining like shit outside and what I had planned I'm just not going to do today and it's a total failure. It's a write-off. Today's a write-off. I notice these thoughts recurring.

**Speaker E:** And it's fantastic. You recognize that these are your own categories. You're like failing to live up to your own. Like, you could have sorted any way you want. You have complete freedom over how you categorize your life. But yeah, you're like, okay, I'm going to hold these standards and I never quite reach them.

**Speaker D:** If I told you guys my standards, you'd be like, oh my God, you're crazy. Easy, you know? Like, if you came and like saw what I was doing, you'd be like, I mean, that's like— nobody does this, Joe. Just take it easy on yourself, you know? And so then I like— when I see that, I'm like, oh, if they think I can take it easy on myself, why are you not taking it easy on yourself? You know, you're like— right.

**Speaker E:** But then that's you, but that's like a validation from others. Like, there's a validation thing that's going on. It's like, oh, I need someone else to tell me it's okay. I can't tell myself it's okay. Interesting.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** So guys, I have to go.

**Speaker C:** It's nice to chat with everybody, and, uh, it's really helpful.

**Speaker E:** Peaceful week, and I'll talk to you soon.

**Speaker C:** Bye, guys.

**Speaker D:** Thanks so much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, bye-bye.

**Speaker E:** Bye.

**Speaker C:** I think you're a badass, Jim.

**Speaker D:** But this validation thing, this validation thing is, it's crazy. It's crazy. And like, I know a lot of it is like schooling and like You know, just, yeah, I was listening to a talk with Anagami and he was like, aim for like 70%, you know, and he's like, that's like a good percent because if you have 30% wrong, that's something to learn from, you know, like if you're not making mistakes like that, how are you ever going to learn? Like he's like, I give you permission to make mistakes and I think that I have to just keep repeating that to myself that it's It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to try things out in life, fail, and try again, you know? Because sometimes I get this thing where I'm like, I failed so bad and I fucked up my life so badly that this is it, you know? And I went from being just on the right road to now I'm not. And all these thoughts and comparisons and comparisons to other farmers and other people's lives and things like that, you know, that are, just not realistic. And like, hey, you're doing the best that you can, you know, like we all are, you know. And okay, if you didn't get anything done today, who cares, you know? Like, I don't have a boss on my ass. I'm the only person on my ass.

**Speaker A:** Even if sometimes I could be worse, the boss, it would be okay.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. Sometimes I find it easier to blow off a boss though, because it's like somebody else, and then you're like, oh, whatever, that guy's an idiot. But like, you believe yourself. These unrealistic standards of like, I gotta meditate at this time, I gotta wake up at this time, I gotta do this for this many hours.

**Speaker C:** And like, and yeah, it's— they really don't kill you, man. They take such a toll on me for sure. Like, I always find like, I'll be most faithful for like a day and then I'll just be burnt out the next day. Just burnt to a crisp, like completely just like You know, sometimes my entire like worldview changes where it will be one day like this is the solution, and then the other day it'll be like the exact opposite of just lazing around. That's the solution because I'm just so burnt out and like grinding myself into the ground.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure, you can build a habit of burning yourself out. Like you can go hard for 20 days and then for one month you're in a hole.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, for me it'll be like hard for like a couple hours and then in a hole for the rest of the week.

**Speaker A:** I think like that one day, like you go really hard, you put yourself into that rabbit hole because you say I should, I should, I should, I should, and then you do, do, and you create such a high expectation for yourself that if you're not able to meet the next day, you're gonna fall so hard. In the next day you're gonna say, oh, yesterday I did this, this, did this. And then you fall so hard just because you built yourself throughout the day so much. But if you do one thing, one thing right at the day, and then the next day comes and you don't do it, you're like, ah, it's still okay, it's just one thing I didn't do. It's not like 10 things like yesterday, you know. So the more we build ourselves, the more we set ourselves for a trap. Like, the bigger the fall is going to be, the deeper the rabbit hole, as they say.

**Speaker D:** What I find is that I end up getting more done when I just am relaxed and I just naturally follow whatever rhythm is coming up. And I know that I have these things that I like need to be doing, but if I let them occur at their own pace, then they occur. But I spend so much time thinking about when they will occur and planning and trying to be efficient that then I do burn myself out and I end up getting less done. And I can see that I've done this for a lot of years. So it's a really hard retraining process of— because I basically, like most of my adult life, I've worked for myself. So I've been my own internal boss and I've been a rough boss on myself, you know, and it's a retraining process and really reminding myself Wait a minute, look at how much stuff you got done when you just naturally walked when you had to walk and lifted this thing when you had to lift it and went and did this and went and did that. And look at that, amazing. These things just seem to get done on their own because you enjoyed the whole process and you didn't get to the end of it like, oh my God, that was horrible. You know, thank God I'm done with that. But you just could enjoy each aspect of that task as, you know, as it was. And this is a constant thing. That's why I really appreciate that I have the time to like, to do this, to work for myself. But it's, but sometimes it's like, like when I have been working for somebody else and I just have a mindless thing to do, I'm like, wow, this is so, this is so easy because like, I just, I just got to get this thing done. And like, there's no standards because I know that they've set a standard that is doable. And it's hard when you're working for yourself because you're like, knowing the financial pressures of it and like, holy crap, I mean, I have to set unrealistic standards because this just ain't going to work out financially if I don't work for so many hours. But to accept, okay, well, this just isn't going to work out, you know, like I'm just going to lose money. And that's a hard one to accept. But it's something that you kind of have to do if you want to maintain your sanity. See the bigger picture and like, okay, well, it's not always going to be like that, you know, it's going to change eventually. You'll have other things in place and you'll get more efficient and, you know, you work with other people eventually. And yeah, so these are some things that I'm seeing with, with myself.

**Speaker C:** Nice. I thought of another way to phrase my question from the beginning. Would that be okay if I try and ask you? Okay, so basically, if it causes me to suffer more to try and remove the hindrances Should I do it or just like surrender to the allegiance? Do or do not.

**Speaker D:** I know neither choice is really ideal.

**Speaker C:** Sorry, I was quoting— yeah, yeah.

**Speaker G:** I mean, that's the thing, right? I think it's like, I mean, it's spotting them and then I think it is like really just that chain reaction of spotting it and that congratulations and like, like there is that little bit of effort and then sustaining. But like, I got to try real, real hard to like pull out this hindrance or whatever. There's still that effort, you know what I mean? That essence of almost thirst, right? Like of getting rid of it. But in that moment that you spotted it, even if it is just for a minute or moment, sorry, it's gone for that moment, right? It's like that's sort of the speed at which things function, right?

**Speaker C:** You saying that actually really answered my question because it kind of gave me this insight that like don't focus on the results, don't focus on the removal of the hindrance, focus on the process. Enjoy the process of notes. Oh, you noticed. Hey, congrats. Not expecting, like Joe was saying, like, this actually kind of hit me and something when he said that, like, not expecting that's going to remove the hindrance and being bummed out, but it didn't.

**Speaker D:** But focusing on just the process, just the process, just the process, and not even caring about the hindrance, like, just the process of— yeah, of That's what just must— a lot of practice is just focusing on the whole process of it and just reminding ourselves that other people have done this, and/or I have done this and seen results. Let's not try and theoretically come up with why I'm doing less. I'm just gonna do this, you know, and I'm gonna see what happens if I keep this up. And I'm in it for the long haul, right? Because this is, this is all short-term sort of things. But like, these successes, eventually you get to the point where you're like, wow, I mean, my whole identity and personality has changed, you know, just on, on the relative level, you know, where like, I am a kinder person. And it kind of snuck up on me. And, and it wasn't like the times that I theoretically thought about it that really helped. And but it's like when I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna just do this because I'm gonna trust that this works, you know, just I'm gonna put my heart into this, you know, and get in touch with these feelings that I'm having, you know, because other wiser people than me have told me that this is what helps, you know. And when I've been able to like give into that trust like, yeah, it's like, hey, just do it, you know, because it's like, it's fun, it's enjoyable, you know. If it's not enjoyable, then like, don't do it, you know. But like, sort of resigning, it's sort of like, when I get like that, it's like I think the world's gonna stop, where I'm just like, okay, well, this is it, like the world's just ending right now, and this is just like the state that I'm gonna be in, and the state of things, and and it's kind of like I'm expecting the movie to end, but everything keeps going and it's not static. And this is why, like, when you go to, like, monasteries and stuff, they're often active and they're often, like, doing projects and changing up the schedule and, like, just doing weird stuff, because they don't want us to, like, be stuck on this, like, attachment to tranquility, this attachment to just like this sort of static sort of thing, you know, that our idea of practice. But it's flowing, it's changing, it's shifting, it's fluxing. That's reality. It's constantly moving, you know. We can't see it until we still our minds. And so it's a weird sort of dichotomy of like, the more we still our minds, the more we see everything is changing, everything is fluxing, everything is just going, you know, and we're not really totally in control of it. It's kind of going on its own.

**Speaker A:** That's why I think, like, when I said it all ties up, what just Joe said, it all comes down to pressure. That's when I said relax, because it's constantly moving. So in one scenario, as we always say, you might need to actively seek out and remove Dukkha, but in some scenarios you might actually not need to do it. You might just need to relax. So it's really constantly shifting. So you're looking for a one-way answer right now as you're asking that question. You're always looking, okay, if I got this one tip, I'm gonna do it tomorrow when it shows up or next time it shows up. But in reality, it's a new moment. It's already shifted. So you're gonna have to investigate and look what really is it. Is it doubt? Is it frustration? Is it something new? It's never the same thing. It's never going to be the same sadness. It's always fresh.

**Speaker D:** Relax, and relaxing is moving, removing the hindrance. Yeah, that is a direct path of removing the hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Both ways you're removing, removing it.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, yeah, because like if you just go into relaxing into it, right, or just— yeah, the relaxing, that's the new sort of, um, moment, right? So it's not like, you know, I think that's the thing is like, oh, these hindrances are all going on in the background. I got to hit every single one of them before I can finally relax. And it's like, no, that moment, if you are with your breath and you are relaxing, there isn't these hindrances present. It's the one, the thought arises of, oh no, I need to catch a hindrance right now. This isn't right. That's when the hindrances arise, you know, come up, right? Yeah, there's something to do.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. Is it, should we aim for the first Jhana, the full no hindrances, or is it enough to just be like satisfied with having some hindrances, just like what being overall happy?

**Speaker G:** Well, I think it's like, I mean, when you're satisfied there, there isn't like the hindrances, right?

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker G:** Like, at least I think in the terms we're talking about satisfaction, right? If there is like, okay, if you are unsatisfied, right, it's because you are, you know, craving something. You can't be like thirsty and quenched at the same time, right? Like, so like, that's the thing. You might fluctuate. So I think this is the idea too of like viewing a Jhana in a very like permanent thing, like, oh man, I'm going to go into Jhana for 20 minutes, rather than, okay, it'll kind of stay a little bit more stable, but oh, pop. You know what I mean? As the hindrance comes up, spot it, right? But I mean, I think the general attitude will be much more to be like, okay, we can come back to this very easily, very much with a sense of ease. And when something comes up, it's very You know, it's easy to spot it or take care of it or just relax back into it because it does it. Okay, whatever, you know, a little stray thought came up. Okay, just float away, you know.

**Speaker A:** One metaphor comes to my head is like pulling rope, like pulling rope contest. You're constantly pulling rope with yourself. Sometimes you have to let go of the rope so the opponent falls into you. Sometimes you have to pull the rope, you know, that's Yeah, it can be confusing to know like one to do each, I guess.

**Speaker D:** I would say it's something to aim for. If there is anything to aim for, is being okay with reality as it is right now, you know, and to see, wow, I'm in the present moment and this is really wonderful exactly right where I'm at. That's something to aim for and to constantly be going for all the time. Who cares about, you know, the Jhana, like the Jhanas, you know, like just be okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so that's kind of what I'm doing. I'm like just being okay, like even though I'm not in a perfect Jhana, and I don't really want to do the effort of creating enough Piti and just energy.

**Speaker D:** Can we change our minds to see if there's actually nothing wrong in the present moment? Can we, can we rewire our brains to, to see that, that this whole thought that there was ever something wrong right now is created inside of myself, you know? And like, that's, that's That's like the practice that we're cultivating, is to see right now there's nothing wrong, there's nowhere to go, there's nothing to do. If there is something to do, I'm gonna do it joyfully, you know. But most of the time there's nothing to do, there's no danger here, nothing wrong, you know. And we keep doing this over and over and over again. And when we find ourselves caught, we just come back to this, and it's just a good reminder, you know. And that's why I find it can be less than helpful sometimes with the super technical, hardcore Dharma stuff, because sometimes I wonder— I know I've mentioned this before, but it's worth repeating, I think— how are these guys in everyday life? How is their relationships with their parents? How is their relationships with their friends? How are they interacting with others? Do they have like kindness, you know? I don't really know because like all I get from their descriptions and the way that they talk is like a bunch of technical things going on, you know, and they're really good at breaking down reality into little fragments. And you know, you see a lot of, a lot of things about, you know, different descriptions of what's going on, but it's like, are they, are they able to actually it's almost like they're practicing in a different, in a different, like, way. And their, and their goals are on, like, a different wavelength than where I've come to with my goals, right? And that is, okay, so my mind is gonna, like, keep being unsatisfied with reality, and I'm going to have to change that to remind myself, no, no, no, everything's okay, Joe. Like, there's no problem here. It's all made up for yourself, you know?

**Speaker C:** And yeah, and it's a challenge, you know, like it's— I wish sadness was on the hindrances list, so there was like a way to deal with it because there's no sadness hindrance. I wish there was.

**Speaker A:** I just kind of noticed, Robert, when Joe said, can we just appreciate this moment right now, you kind of like relaxed and you had a little smile, and then you went back into like this thinking about it really hard, and then you come up with another question like, oh, I wish there was sadness. You relaxed for a second, then you moved on. So that's what we're saying by relaxing.

**Speaker C:** That's good, nice. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** You're able to do it whenever you want to. When we mention it to take a breath, you take a breath and you relax. That's it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I feel it for a second, I get a couple seconds.

**Speaker D:** So you build on that success, you build on that success and you just do it over and over and over again and it never it never stops, you know. And like, there's never a time to not have this, you know, like to just keep doing it over and over again and build on the success. And oh yeah, I can really do this, you know, like I got this, this isn't so hard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's one big key point is have trust in yourself that you can do this. Like there is no authority out there that can help you deal with this as we talked before. You are responsible for it. Even if you talk to Dhammarato, even if you talk to us, you already know how to do it. You already done it many, many times. You're an expert in this. You know how to do it. And having that trust will bring you back to the success.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think that's the doubt.

**Speaker A:** You're experiencing the doubt. It all boils down to the first thing, as we mentioned. It's the doubt. That's it. You don't trust that you can deal with it.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, yeah, I think like being satisfied and content with the knowledge and the skill that you have is very, very helpful, like, into being able to, yeah, just see it again and it's like, okay, because like that's— yeah.

**Speaker D:** You're sounding like a little bit of an Arahant again.

**Speaker A:** It's all right, it's okay, just do it all again.

**Speaker D:** It's a really good like mindfulness, but it's like, it's kind of funny seeing his reaction every time, you know, of like, oh no, it's a good mindfulness bell each time. Yeah, so one thing I think— sadness isn't listed as a hindrance because it's, uh, it's not, it's not a hindrance, you know. It's, it's just an emotion, and it's like, it's okay to be sad, like, because you can be— you can have all these emotions and feel sadness at the same time, you know. Like, you can kind of be realistic about the world it is difficult. Like, I mean, when I look at people who are a little bit younger than me, I'm like, man, the age that you're at is fucking difficult, you know? And like, I just— you just have to have trust where I'm like, hey, like, give it a few years and it gets like a lot easier, you know? And when I talk to older people that practice, they kind of say the same thing to me when I'm struggling with stuff, and they're like, oh, wait till you get to 60. You know, and they're— I've heard people say this to me where they're like, what, I consider myself like a complete idiot all my 30s and 40s. Like, it wasn't until 60 that I really figured out what was going on, you know. And so it's like, wow, that's wonderful that like life is getting better.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, life is getting better. That's awesome, man. That's such a wholesome way of reframing it.

**Speaker D:** What a different way of going. Yeah, it's going to get easier because I'm going to get better at this. You know, and I'm gonna keep practicing, and like, things are just going to keep flowing with each other and get better. And when you hear other things from society, you just say, okay, whatever, you're living in a different world, and hold on to your views really strongly, and I'll have some other more wholesome views, you know, that things are easy right now, but if I practice more, these skills will develop, you know, because I've seen them develop. And Wow, it's going to be really easy, you know, because it's really easy right now, a lot easier than when I was 16. I mean, we all can say that, right? It's just one success after another. It just, they just build, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I really, I really resonate with something Carl said as well, like, um, like the whole holding on to the victim identity. I do that a lot when I feel like I've been the sufferer for a long time. When I start to taste the gladness, I'm like, fuck it, it's bullshit, it's fake, it's fleeting, I don't even want it. I'm just gonna stay being a victim, you know?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** But it's actually— I can actually just— it is objectively like a better experience of like life, so I might as well give up that identity for the satisfaction.

**Speaker G:** Oh yeah, it's like there's that attachment to it, and then for those moments you're born as the victim, right? Or yeah, but it's just like seeing through it and being like, yeah, you know what, don't have to do that. That's a momentary thing, you know. But they'll come— sometimes comes back up. Okay.

**Speaker A:** I don't know if I'm going to repeat myself, but yeah, well, I can relate to that because if once I see this victim, I also investigate into it, seeing the fears that come behind. It usually comes with a bundle of fears of You don't want to feel good because you're afraid of feeling good. You're afraid of being loved. You're afraid of nurturing yourself. It can come from your childhood. It can come from a lot of things. Those things actually don't matter, but it comes from that lack of love for yourself. You're not able to give love to yourself. It's almost like I do not deserve it. I don't deserve this love. Who am I to receive this love? You know, it's sort of like a fear of being different version of yourself. Of being loving towards yourself and others. It's very harsh to be loving to other people nowadays because we live in such a competitive society that you see this competitiveness everywhere. So love is perceived as something as a weak trait. Oh, if you're kind to others, if you give money to others, if you show respect to others, you're weak. So we build this identity that, oh, I cannot show any weakness in this society because I have to look strong. I cannot love myself. That's what I noticed. Like, I see this all the time because I come from martial art backgrounds. I see these dudes in the gym who lift weights, who look really tough because they cannot give themselves some love. It's all it boils down to, like, you know, big boy problem.

**Speaker D:** So I think one thing that you said though is you said we can look at our childhood and it doesn't really matter. It might not matter, but sometimes it's helpful to disidentify with it to see where these things come from a little bit. For me, at least, I find where I'm like, wow, this thought that I'm having, I remember my mom really having these same worries, you know. And you kind of disidentify a little bit when you're like, wait a minute, like, this isn't totally me. Whenever I have money worries, I'm just like, oh, that's my mom right there, you know. And I can just see it immediately. And it's like, it's disidentify with the thoughts a little bit, you know, Because a lot, a lot of the thoughts that we have are not really like coming from ourselves or our own, you know.

**Speaker A:** It never is. Yeah, but what I meant, it doesn't mean you're right. It's good to see it. You're just seeing it, uh, on more under microscope. What I mean, you can see it's Dukkha and you can just throw it out. As far as that, it doesn't matter. You're already at expert level that you can see, okay, oh, it's my mom, boom, out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you just— yeah, you don't need to dig really hard, right? Exactly. Yeah, you don't need to dig into it because that's the other aspect of what modern people love doing is being like, oh, I went through this when I was 12, and everybody wants to sit in a circle and talk about it for hours. And, you know, and then you go back a year later and they're still talking about the same thing, you know. And it's like, no, you just, you just see it and you're like, oh, that's, that's that thing. Okay, let's drop that one, you know. Easy to see. Moving on to the next one, you know.

**Speaker C:** It almost feels like an active violence to let go of my victimhood identity. Like I'm committing an act of violence on myself to become satisfied.

**Speaker D:** You're going to have to keep doing it over and over again. You know, is that like, it doesn't ever permanently go away.

**Speaker C:** It keeps coming.

**Speaker D:** It keeps coming back. And you keep having to remind yourself. Yeah, and you keep on reminding yourself that you're not the only one. Like, it's not a one-person battle. Like, we're in this together, you know?

**Speaker C:** Like, I'm not the only one, but there is only one way out, right? The victimhood just leads to more victimhood. So there is only one way out, and you have to bite the bullet and stop being a victim eventually and stop pitying yourself eventually.

**Speaker D:** No, it's not eventually, just right now.

**Speaker C:** Right now. I mean, like, I meant, like, to encourage myself to, like, do it. Yeah, well, I have to do that too.

**Speaker D:** But it sounded a little bit harsh and unrealistic where it's like, oh, just do it right now. And, you know, and if you fall into it again, it's okay, you know?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I think.

**Speaker D:** All right.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, it is helpful to, like, see when, like, perhaps rules are forming, right? And being like, oh, okay. Because like, then, you know, there is— there'll be like this, you know, self that is born into that. And oh, there's this static image of myself yet again. Oh no, I'm not supposed to have that, you know, static image of myself ever. And it's like, wait a minute, that's just another static image of the self coming in, being born yet again. You know, rather than just, oh, isn't this wonderful to just be here now with the breath, content, satisfied, you know, that is just, you know, wonderful. And so yeah, and just to see the process, see the process of that self being born, right? You know, when there's a little baby Robert coming up, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, little rule maker.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, you know what, one thing that's been interesting for me in like, like meeting Alex has been like really taking this like whatever works approach where it seems for Alex that what works for him is like he talks to Dhammarato every day, you know, and like badass as hell, man, badass as hell.

**Speaker C:** I don't have the balls. I feel like I just bore him to death with like the same problems again and again.

**Speaker D:** But it works for Alex, you know.

**Speaker C:** Is that— I know, I kind of want to see that.

**Speaker D:** He's like, you know what, like he's taken the humbleness to be like, you know what, I know that we're supposed to be taking advice and going off on our own and, you know, doing this, but you know what, for me, I need to get reminded again. Like, hey, can you just repeat this one again for me, Dhammarato? And Dhammarato has all the patience in in the world, you know. I mean, like, I mean, any practitioner who's gotten results from the path will also have that patience, you know, and just repeat the same thing over and over and over again because they know how it is and they don't really care, you know. But sometimes this one-person battle thing, we're like sitting there and like, you know, you're like, I got— I got to do this, I know what to do, I know what I'm supposed to to do, and we don't have the humbleness to just reach out and be like, I'll just give Dhammarato a call. And really, yeah, I don't need to sound smart or have a question for him or anybody else, you know, anybody else that you're friends with, you know, uh, or watch a Dharma talk or listen to a guided meditation or whatever it is that works, you know. It doesn't really matter. Um, it's not like, okay, this is like training wheels and eventually I have to let these ones go, you know. Um, it's been a real change for me seeing this because I really used to be like anti-guided meditation because I used to think that you couldn't really see your own reality if you're listening to somebody telling you what you're supposed to be seeing. But I think it can be really helpful.

**Speaker C:** That's a trippy thought, man. That's crazy.

**Speaker A:** It comes back to enjoying the Dharma. Once you— once you like— once you're really into it, you enjoy— you, you understand, you enjoy listening to it, you enjoy talking about it, you enjoy anything to do with it because it is within you. So even if you watch the video— It never gets boring. When I watch, like when you say, when you use Alex's example, I see that as well. Like I watched like a couple of videos of Alex and for me it's always a reminder. Like I don't have to go talk to Dhammarato. I can just watch a video with somebody and I'll be like, oh yeah, that's, I'm doing it, you know.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, but there definitely is something too to the repetition when it comes to the practice, right? And it's just working these things in like over time, you know, because I think that's the thing is that's true.

**Speaker C:** It takes time. Yeah, it totally takes time to sink in. I mean, you want to rush and shit, are you?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, there's often that. Oh, I've already heard this. Time for something new, time for, you know, the next thing, because I've already heard this, I know it. But, you know, yeah, yeah, it gets forgotten. And so it's like, oh, that's a wonderful reminder just to hear it again. Like, I mean, even say something like, say, the Seven Factors of Awakening are brought up or whatever, those can even just gladden the mind just being brought up, right? So this is a reminder of them.

**Speaker C:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I've got notes hanging all around my house in different spots, like above my sink and stuff like that, with little reminders that are helpful, you know. And I did that a long time ago, and each time it never gets old, like saying the little mantra type thing, you know, that's to do with it. Just a little reminder, you know. And it's funny, sometimes I can see I can see when, like, I get— like, I can really, really see clearly when I'm really in a hindrance, when I get angry at the note. I'm like, fuck that note, you know? And then I'm like, oh well, I'm really, I'm really in a hindrance. I might want to go sit right now and take a minute. When I'm— yeah, I'm getting ungrateful for the water that's coming out of the faucet.

**Speaker C:** Oh my God. Oh man, everything you guys just said, I relate to so much.

**Speaker A:** Cool, guys, I'm gonna shoot out.

**Speaker C:** Okay, that was excellent. See you guys. It's been great, man. Thank you for the advice. Really, really appreciate it. Thank you, man. Have a wonderful day. I'm gonna have to shoot out too soon. I'm gonna do some meditation. I'm gonna


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on a practitioner (Robert/Speaker C) grappling with a core dilemma: he finds a certain "satisfaction" in a passive, depressed state because actively gladdening the mind feels like effortful work. The conversation, guided by experienced Sangha friends, deconstructs this confusion and offers practical advice.

### **Core Issue & Misunderstanding**
*   **Robert's Dilemma:** He reports feeling more "satisfied" when depressed because it's less effort than generating positive emotions (piti, joy). He confuses resignation and numbness with genuine satisfaction.
*   **Key Correction:** The group clarifies that **true satisfaction (santutthi) and suffering (dukkha) cannot coexist**. What he's calling satisfaction is actually **resignation, giving up, or identifying with a "victim" self**. As Speaker E notes, "It's giving up, but it's not the same as letting go."

### **Primary Advice & Insights**
The group offers several interconnected solutions:

1.  **Relax, Don't Force:** The primary antidote is **relaxation**. Trying to "fix" dukkha or force happiness creates more tension and suffering. The instruction is to slow down, relax the body, and observe without adding effortful striving.
2.  **Investigate the Full Field of Experience:** Dukkha isn't always verbal thoughts. It can manifest as **visual imagery, bodily sensations, or subtle moods**. The advice is to gently investigate the entire sensory field when feeling low.
3.  **Dis-identify and De-personalize:** The problem isn't sadness itself, but the **identification** with it—the "sufferer" or "victim" self. The group suggests:
    *   **Seeing thoughts as impersonal:** Noticing how thoughts (e.g., worries) may be inherited patterns, not core truths.
    *   **Allowing emotions without ownership:** One can feel sadness without being a victim of it, like being moved by a sad song. As Speaker B says, "The problem isn't the dukkha. The problem is the victim of the dukkha."
4.  **Focus on the Process, Not the Goal:** Robert is caught in a goal-oriented "Western mindset." The practice is about **continuous gentle noticing**, not achieving a permanent state. Success is in the momentary act of recognizing a hindrance or relaxing, not in eliminating hindrances forever.
5.  **Build on Micro-Successes:** Confidence comes from trusting small moments of success—a single relaxed breath, a instant of seeing a thought as just a thought. **"Build on that success... over and over again."**
6.  **The Wholesome Desire for Truth:** The discussion distinguishes between craving (which causes dukkha) and the **wholesome desire for truth**—the sincere inclination to see things as they are. This desire is the fuel for the path.

### **Key Metaphors & Concepts**
*   **Looking for Dukkha:** If you look for suffering where there is none, the very search creates it.
*   **Pulling a Rope:** Sometimes you need to pull (apply effort), sometimes you need to let go (relax). Wisdom is knowing which is needed in the moment.
*   **The Present Moment as Container:** The true present isn't a sliver between past and future; it's the **container within which time unfolds**. The goal is to experientially inhabit this.
*   **"Seeing" as Always On:** A insight is shared that awareness ("seeing") is always happening. Noticing that all phenomena—good, bad, or neutral—are equally "seen" can reduce judgment and identification.

### **Conclusion**
The talk gently guides Robert from a place of confused resignation to a clearer understanding of the path. The consensus is that he should **stop trying to force a change, relax into his present experience, investigate it without identifying with it, and find genuine satisfaction in the simple, effortless awareness of the truth of the present moment.** The underlying message is one of kindness, patience, and trust in the gradual process of practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about meditation, suffering, and mindfulness. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1. **"Rabbit hole"** – Used to describe getting stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts or sadness.  
   *Example:* Speaker A warns about falling into a "rabbit hole" of sadness or overthinking.

2. **"Grinding"** – Refers to putting excessive effort into practice, often leading to burnout.  
   *Example:* Speaker D says, "Do I just keep grinding until…" and others caution against forcing progress.

3. **"Tug-of-war" or "Pulling rope"** – Describes the internal struggle between resisting and accepting emotions.  
   *Example:* Speaker A compares dealing with hindrances to a tug-of-war where sometimes you need to "let go of the rope."

4. **"Victim identity"** – A metaphor for clinging to suffering or a self-narrative of being a sufferer.  
   *Example:* Speaker C talks about "holding on to the victim identity" and the difficulty of letting it go.

5. **"Layering"** – Refers to adding extra judgments or expectations on top of an existing emotion.  
   *Example:* Speaker E mentions "layering a bunch of extra expectations" instead of simply observing.

6. **"Rewiring the brain"** – Describes the process of changing habitual thought patterns through practice.  
   *Example:* Speaker D talks about "rewiring our brains and our heart" through mindfulness.

7. **"Slow mode"** – Contrasts meditative awareness with the speed of everyday thinking.  
   *Example:* Speaker D mentions how formal practice helps shift into "slow mode."

8. **"Mothership" / "Alien planet"** – A humorous metaphor for disconnection or distorted perception during hindrances.  
   *Example:* When Robert’s audio glitches, others joke that he sounds like he’s "on an alien planet" or "dragged up to the mothership."

10. **"Training wheels"** – Refers to using supports like guided meditations or teachers until one internalizes the practice.  
    *Example:* Speaker D discusses guided meditations as "training wheels" that can be helpful without shame.

### **Stories & Analogies:**

1. **Movie analogy** – Used to explain how one can observe emotions without identifying with them.  
   *Example:* Speaker B says, "When you watch a movie, there may be sad moments, but there’s no dukkha there… you’re not attached."

2. **Graph analogy** – Describes the present moment as a mathematical point that is always approaching but never fully reached.  
   *Example:* Speaker D compares the present moment to a graph asymptotically approaching a point.

3. **Breathing as an anchor** – A simple story about using the breath to return to the present.  
   *Example:* Speaker A says, "Take a breath… you will feel the presence for a split second."

4. **Farming and seasons** – Speaker D shares his personal story about how his practice changes with his work as a farmer (busy vs. relaxed seasons), illustrating the natural flux of practice.

5. **Childhood patterns** – Speaker D mentions recognizing his mother’s worries in his own thoughts, using it as a story to explain disidentification from inherited mental habits.

6. **Jed McKenna reference** – A brief allusion to spiritual author Jed McKenna’s ideas about truth, used to frame the discussion on desire for truth.

7. **Laundry and music** – A simple anecdote about making mundane tasks pleasant by adding music, illustrating how to bring mindfulness to daily life.

8. **Monastery schedules** – Speaker D references monastic life, where schedules change to prevent attachment to tranquility, illustrating impermanence and adaptability.

These metaphors and stories help make abstract Dharma concepts relatable, emphasizing themes like **non-striving, acceptance, impermanence, and self-compassion**.
