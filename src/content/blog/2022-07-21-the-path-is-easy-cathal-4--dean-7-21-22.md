### Transcript


**Speaker A:** A lady who was bringing him food, and I'm nearly sure one of the foods was a big steak. Do monks eat meat?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** There was a picture on the Facebook page, and there was somebody was coming to offer him food, and I think one of the plates was a big steak.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Is that okay? Do monks eat steak and meat?

**Speaker B:** Monks eat food.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but do they eat steak? I thought you're all vegetarians.

**Speaker B:** No, no, listen to me. Monks eat food. They eat the food that's offered.

**Speaker A:** Oh, no problem. That's no bother. That's no bother. And I see they do some chanting as well. Now I know you don't talk too much about chanting, but are these all good things?

**Speaker B:** Mostly it's because I don't want to bore the students with it. You want to hear some chanting? I got some. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But is there any benefit to chanting? I never hear you prescribe chanting.

**Speaker B:** Um, that's because the people that I would prescribe chanting to have no opportunity to learn how to do it. There is very, very little chanting that is available on the internet, and so, uh, chanting along with them on the Internet would be one of the ways of doing it. In fact, one of the things that could be found would be something like. It goes on. So, yes, there. There is chanting. It has several values. One value is that it helps focus the mind. While you're chanting the Dharma, you're not having a whole lot of unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, cool. So it's like a kind of another form of meditation?

**Speaker B:** Well, if you want to call it that, I'll agree that you can use the word meditation for that too. A better way of saying it is that it prepares that in the evening The monks will chant for about 20 minutes for the evening chant, and then they will sit for about 20 minutes, with the understanding that the chanting helps prepare the mind for the sitting meditation. That you're practicing wholesome thoughts, you're remembering, you're getting the mind focused, so that the next 20 minutes will be of great value to you. Okay, the next point about the chanting is that in the time of the Buddha, this was the way that the Dhamma was transmitted, was by the students memorizing a passage. And then after they learned to memorize it, then they would discuss it line by line, word by word, so that the student understood what it was that he had memorized. And that was the main way of learning the Dhamma back in the time when people didn't have books, that you had to rely upon your own memory. This is also part of the reason why the Dhamma is so numerically oriented, in the sense of 500 Suttas and 7 Factors of Enlightenment and 8 Noble Paths and 4 Noble Truths and 5 aggregates. Three kinds of feelings and 16 stages of Anapanasati and 12 steps of Piti to Samuppada. All of those things are memory aids to help us to remember. But Western Buddhists, when they hear about all of those numbered things, they think that that means that the Dharma is very complicated. No, those are just memory aids. Aids to help the monks remember things that are very easy.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. And so the chanting has enormous value when it's done correctly, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa wasn't a big fan of it. But when I got into the United States, I was with a monk named Maha Samsara who was he is. Let us say, within certain communities in Laos, Thai, and Khmer, that he is the go-to guy when it comes to chanting. That he does all of the chanting, and there's quite a history that I have with Maha Samsara. But it was in defense of him that I actually wrote a book on chanting. There's a book out published someplace that it's about 250 pages or so of a book that I wrote in 2008. The name of it is "The Complete Book of Pauli Chanting." So you can Google "The Complete Book of Pauli Chanting" and come up with it, because it's out there online. So when you recognize that I've actually written a book on chanting, you may not have the same opinion that I don't like it.

**Speaker A:** So, Dhammarato, I know they do chanting and meditation early in the morning, like 6:00 or 6:30, and the same in the evening time at around 6:00 or 6:30 PM. But them times are not I will not be able to get down there at them times. So, but I'm still presuming there's still plenty of benefit for me going down in between them times when I can, right?

**Speaker B:** If you can get there a little bit earlier— 1 PM local time is a little late. If you have to, uh, be late, I would say 12 would be better, but 11 would be even better than that, and 10 would be the ideal time.

**Speaker A:** Right, so, okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, and here's what happens. At 10 AM, people start to arrive, they make friends. This is the time for you to meet people, meet the abbot, see things the way that they are. And then at 11 is when the chanting for the noon meal will start, and then they will do the chanting and then the meal. And then that meal may be a long one. And so, if you show up at 1 o'clock, they still may be eating. Or the other thing is, after the lunchtime meal, normally in Asia, because of the tropics and histories and all of that, this is the time for people to disappear to their kutis, to take a nap. And so, if you wind up there at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the abbot may just have left and is not available. That's one of the dangers of 1 PM. If you can arrive a little bit before that, the earlier you can arrive, closer to 12 o'clock, the better. So I'd say 12:50 is better than 1 o'clock. This is kind of the critical time. At 1 o'clock, you may not be able to see him. —because he's gone.

**Speaker A:** That's no problem, I'll stand there and meditate.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Or there may be someone there. I'll be expecting— Yeah, it won't be a dead waste even if he's not there. It will not be a waste even if he's not there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I might meet someone and they might, I might, they might pass on a message for me that I'm interested in the Dharma. And you never know, I'll see him another time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you never know. I do. I've been there, done that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, no, that's brilliant. I'm looking forward. I'm really, really looking forward to it now, and I really want to get involved there. Like, and what kind of stuff Dhammarato will be passed on to me on us, like, from just being around the noble person? Like, remember we spoke about before, people who have no formal teaching or anything, but just from being in the Sangha, they become nobles themselves. So what kind of stuff will be happening there, maybe even on a subconscious level, that will rub off on me from being around nobles?

**Speaker B:** Ah, well, if he's cheerful, then cheer will rub off. If he's happy, then happiness will rub off.

**Speaker A:** What if he's like Mahasi Sayadaw? Or was it his Upandita who wasn't so cheerful?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I'm assuming that the guy is a cool dude. I would just go with that. So, I would assume.

**Speaker A:** That. Anyway, Dhammarato, I'm in work, thanks for the call, and I leave your other Dhamma dude there have some time. Thanks, nice to meet you.

**Speaker C:** Nice to meet you, Dean.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Dean, good luck, have fun at the WAT.

**Speaker A:** Will indeed, thanks guys.

**Speaker B:** So, Kath.

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** You're— yes, okay.

**Speaker C:** Let me— yes. Hi.

**Speaker B:** It would be better if you could turn your camera sideways. You also have it on screen lock, so you need to change the screen lock.

**Speaker C:** Screen rotation. Oh, hold on. Like, oops, like this?

**Speaker B:** That's, that's the best, uh, that's the back camera. Okay, do you have an Android?

**Speaker C:** Do I have a— yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, hold it vertically, scroll down, uh, with the fingers from the top of the screen, and it'll give you a little menu. And one of the menu items should be screen rotation or screen lock.

**Speaker C:** Oh, like auto rotate?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, auto rotate. Okay, change that and now change the camera and see if it doesn't— there you go!

**Speaker C:** Hey, I should be the one who knows this stuff, you know? But yeah, cool, right, right, all right.

**Speaker B:** Anyway, it's good to see you again. I see that you were enjoying what Dean and I were talking about. Yeah, yeah, I really encourage people to go to meet Asian monks and whatnot. You'll get a whole lot more value out of that than you will by going to get your Buddha friends on Reddit or someplace.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I hope to visit like these places someday and go actually maybe go to Thailand or something and be in it, like really in it, you know, when I get maybe— Well, actually, you know, I live in a Buddhist center in the UK, but it's, uh, it's, uh, it's not like, um, have you heard of Kadampa Buddhism?

**Speaker B:** No, describe it to me.

**Speaker C:** It's like basically Well, have you heard of Geshe Gyatso Rinpoche?

**Speaker B:** You use the word Rinpoche, which that, that clicks. Okay, right. So this is Vajrayana or Tibetan.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's like, it's like a kind of a tradition of Tibetan Buddhism and it's called Kadampa and it's, it's this modern New Age Buddhism kind of thing and they have all these centers that you can volunteer and stay at. And yeah, it's pretty far out, you know, it's kind of wild. People would often describe it as like a cultish Buddhism kind of thing. And whenever you look it up, it's very like modern. I don't know how to, I really don't know how to describe it, to be honest.

**Speaker B:** Okay. But that is Mahayana. What you're saying is, is that it's run by Westerners?

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Not by Asians? Okay, that's, that's the main thing. Alright, so, the first thing is, is that they probably hold the Dalai Lama in very high regard.

**Speaker C:** Oh, they actually are really against the Dalai Lama. I don't know, they're really like, it's weird, like the guy who created this Kadampa is really not with the whole, Dharmarato thing, you know, it's, it's like a— yeah, it's like an uprising for Tibetan Buddhism, but it, it's like stripped away most of the Tibetan stuff and he introduced it so modern, like Westerners can understand it. So a lot of this Tibetan stuff is really stripped away and it's a bit more, I suppose, perceivable for Westerners.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well What I would say, I mentioned the Dalai Lama, because the Dalai Lama, we have a video of the Dalai Lama with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, where the Dalai Lama calls Bhikkhu Buddhadasa his elder brother. The word elder is kind of important there. So, if the Dalai Lama considers Bhikkhuni his elder brother. That points to the relationship between Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the Dalai Lama, and puts the Dalai Lama with all of the other monks who would consider Bhikkhuni their elder brother or their teacher in a way. But since your crowd there is anti-Dalai Lama, that might not be such a useful piece of information.

**Speaker C:** Well, they're not my crowd. I'm just volunteered here to be in this space, you know. I don't follow it so much.

**Speaker B:** Okay, to get me oriented a little bit, what teaching do they have that is, let us say, antagonistic to the Dalai Lama? Or is it— because actually I do know that the Dhamma, that There are what, 4 or 5 different groups within Tibetan, and the Dalai Lama is only in one of the bigger ones. But there are various older groups. But from what you're telling me, this is a brand new break-off.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, this is like 1980s, I think Gyatso started this whole thing, actually. ... Yeah, and he's just been building centers across the world and they're really wild temples and it's very based around practices like a lot of Puja, a lot of, it's like a lot.

**Speaker B:** Of visualization. Well, visualization is very much part of the Tibetan system, that's why they have Tonkas and Mandalas, you.

**Speaker C:** Know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and there's like all these kind of Buddhas.

**Speaker B:** Like Vajrayana. Actually, that's not the right way to look at it. Instead of calling them magic beings, think of them as ideal.

**Speaker C:** States. Yeah, yeah, ideal qualities or.

**Speaker B:** Something. Ideal qualities rather than ideal.

**Speaker C:** People. Yeah, yes. Tara, I don't know, there's quite a few. Honestly, I don't know, I couldn't. The protector of Dharma, Daushin or something, and.

**Speaker B:** Heru. I don't remember, I never put much attention to all of their, the names of these qualities and things like that. But I have been to Nepal and saw quite a lot of the art and whatnot. Yeah. That in fact, The Vajrayana is the one that I would know the least amount about. I'm pretty big.

**Speaker C:** On Zen. Yes, I have never like been anywhere, like I only came here because it's the only really available Buddhist thing that was more approachable for me. Because I have no idea what, I have no idea how. What city is this? It's in, you know, it's in The Lake District of the UK, so it's near Liverpool, I would say, about an hour away from—.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right, that gives me an.

**Speaker C:** Idea.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah. So it's out in the wilderness about an hour from.

**Speaker C:** Liverpool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can show.

**Speaker B:** You the— Never mind, I got enough. That's what I was kind of looking— Wow! That's a.

**Speaker C:** Mansion. Yeah, yeah, it's huge. And the temples here are crazy, like big golden temples full of statues, and it's.

**Speaker B:** Really wild. Well, that's what happened to Christianity, so I can imagine that's what happens to Buddhism when it gets to.

**Speaker C:** The West.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So what should we talk about today.

**Speaker C:** Then? Yeah, so basically like I've just been following your advice very straight up, you know, and things actually have been going really nicely in the sense I feel just This gladdening every day, nonstop, has been changing me, like almost fundamentally, in a way, like day to day, like when I wake up till I sleep, things are totally different. And there's a lot more control and seeing in the mind and the way I feel. And meditation is becoming a lot more enjoyable when I go to sit. And I've been splitting the sitting actually for like half an hour, a couple of times a day instead of just this one hour where it's not the most enjoyable. Or also like 3 times for 20 minutes a day. It's a lot more beneficial, I feel like. And I do a lot of walking too. But yeah, maybe like there's some things like in terms of meditation, but I also wanted to ask you more life kind of scenarios and stuff, you know, like, yeah, like certain obstacles that aren't, are more like Westerner obstacles, you.

**Speaker B:** Know, like— Well, are you talking about the obstacles that you're going to experience there where you are, or obstacles when you're not there, when you're other places? Because they're not going to be exactly the same.

**Speaker C:** Obstacles. Well, actually, I'm— yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm leaving here on Sunday because there's a festival and I can't stay. So basically what I'm— I have no idea, like, I could do whatever I want for about a month or so, and I just don't know what is like a good approach to development, like what Because I was thinking like, wow, like it would be really crazy to just go hitchhiking or something or travel or do something that's very developed, like it's very confrontational towards your inner development, so to say, you know what I mean? That makes.

**Speaker B:** Sense? No, I don't. No, I don't. But I wouldn't say confrontational. Maybe nourishing would be a better word to.

**Speaker C:** Use. Yeah, to be able to really be in it, in it, whatever it is, like, and to be able to build the character and the understanding and letting go and kind of surfacing up a lot of little like things, because even thinking about like hitchhiking or something surfaces up like all this fear and little anxious you know, terrible. A lot of attachment comes up, you know, like stuff like that basically. And I wasn't really sure, like there's so many possibilities to do like Workaways or to go to another country and stay and work for food and money and stuff. And you know, and yeah, it's like a lot of those things are really, it's really hard to know what's a good, what's.

**Speaker B:** A good Well, all of those things that you're asking about is, what should I do with the outside? When you call me, I'm going to be more interested in talking about what's happening on the inside. By the way, this group that you're with there, Do they mention a term like.

**Speaker C:** Choiceless awareness? No, I've heard of that.

**Speaker B:** Though. Okay, because that's a Vajrayana term, and since you've already mentioned that they do Puja and they do Tonkas and they do visualizations and all of that kind of stuff, I was wondering if they also did the choiceless awareness, or what kind of meditation that or what kind of practice or what kind of things that they're doing, when they're doing what they're.

**Speaker C:** Calling meditation? Their meditation is very strange, they really don't emphasize meditation that much here, it's more, it's more very deep root in compassion and a lot of wishing, like wishful, there's a lot of wishful.

**Speaker B:** Prayer.— and hoping and hoping. Oh, like, may all beings be happy. Yes, that kind of wishful.

**Speaker C:** Thinking. Aha, okay. If you call it Metta, they never call it Metta around here, but it's.

**Speaker B:** Like that basically. Oh, what do they call.

**Speaker C:** It? I don't know. It's called wishful, wish-fulfilling jewels or something like that, wish-fulfilling jewel. Stuff like that where you would like, You would really recite.

**Speaker B:** It. Sounds like there's a lot of magical stuff. Yes. Oh, maybe that's why it appeals so much. Here's one of the things that's very interesting. You're talking about Tibetans. Guess what? In the West, there are very, very few Tibetans. Of all of the native-born Buddhists that you'll meet, almost all of them will be Theravada because of the situation in Southeast Asia. So, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Those are all Theravada countries. Well, there's a lot of Mahayana in Vietnam, but most of those are all Theravada countries. To where Japanese that came to the United States, they didn't come to promote Zen the way that the Thai people. So the main thing is Theravada that you're going to find in the West. But the problem with the Vajrayana is that there is very few Tibetans anyway. That of all the land area of Tibet, it was all so mountainous that the original population was very small anyway. And that of all of the Tibetans, now it's part of China, but even in the 1950s, many of the Tibetans that left, they went to India to stay. There has been no mass migration out of Tibet to England or the United States or any of the Western countries. Almost all of the Vajrayana that you'll find in the West are Westerners pretending to be Tibetans, which is not true for the Theravada, because at every Theravada wat that you'll find in the West by the hundreds, they all want an absolutely Thai or Asian head abbot. If not every monk in the temple is Asian, but in the Theravada— excuse me, in the Vajrayana, in the Tibetan Every Tibetan, um, temple or situation that I've ever been in, it's always been run by Westerners who at best just know the names.

**Speaker C:** Of some.

**Speaker B:** Asians. Yeah, yeah, that's one of the reasons why we didn't do very much in North Carolina. We had like, uh, more than 40 monks, dozens of Watts. The Vietnamese and the Lao and the Thai and the Cambodian and the Vietnamese, Burmese, and Sri Lankans all worked together. But there was a Vajrayana temple in Asheville, North Carolina, and that was the only thing in Asheville And so the Asian people that were in Asheville would want us to come to Asheville. They didn't want this Vajrayana guy because he was an American and he didn't mix with any of the other monks. That's the way that it seems like, that even though in Asia the Tibetans are just part of the group, but in the West The Tibetans are the odd man out, because for them, all of the stuff that happens in the West is all done by Westerners, but where in the Theravada system, all of it is still Asian, except for Western Buddhism. So the Westerners tend to go towards the Westerners, where they're not going to find Buddhism, or the real Buddha. They go for other Westerners because it's convenient, just like you wound up where you are because it was a convenient thing to.

**Speaker C:** Do. Everybody there speaks English. Yes, that was pretty much the whole.

**Speaker B:** Thing. If it was a— let us say everything was exactly the same except for the people there were the head monks and all were Thai, then that means that Thai language would be the predominant language spoken spoken there. Where you are, the predominant language is English because it's not well represented in the Tibetan language. And so that place that you're at is two steps away, not just a whole step away, it's two steps away from the Buddha. And you can see that they've gotten quite magical.

**Speaker C:** In their two-step. It's very, very magical stuff, like super magical. It's all wishing and visualizing and praying and reciting stuff like.

**Speaker B:** That, you know. Well, what would you say about the people there that you've met? Do you think that they've gotten value out of doing those.

**Speaker C:** Practices? You know, I've observed the monks and nuns here for a long— like since I came here, like really closely and talked to them. And some, it's very like, it's very— it's such a variety of character, you know. It's not like one. It's some people just seem like very unhappy. Some people seem absolutely really cultish. And like very preaching, and some people are very just chilled and happy. It's very— there's no like, you know, it's just people, I suppose. But some people have been here for 15, 20 years and they seem absolutely mentally really in chaos. Some people have been here, you know what I mean? It's very— yeah, it's very— I don't know, it's just no one quality that that I can say it's like, or there's no, there's no like, yes, everyone has got a lot of benefit, I don't.

**Speaker B:** Know. I would say based upon the experience that I have seen, is that if a system is actually working and the system itself is what's working, then people who have been in that system for 10 or 20, no not 10, 20 or 30 years, have gotten great benefit out of it. But what you're saying is that people have been there for more than 20 years and they look like their lives are still in turmoil. So whoever has gotten something from that maybe had gotten part of their value someplace else rather than this.

**Speaker C:** Place. Yeah, I think that's really spot on for the more older nuns and monks who have spent spoken to and had good conversation, like they had more of a journey to get to where they are, so to say, like they've went a lot. And people who are just in it immediately, who just like— some people here literally only found Buddhism through Kadampa. They didn't know who the Buddha was before this. And this, this is like, these are the people who are more leaning towards a lot of like duality in, you know, kind of thing, feeling of— yeah, you can just feel it, you know. I just feel it like very easily with those.

**Speaker B:** People. Um, yeah, I think so, maybe. Okay, well, when you leave there, there the option would be is to go, um, find a better place or to go find a worse place. It's so hard to find— or to go find a real sewer to get into. And so what are your plans when you leave there? What are your plans? Where are you? What you got in.

**Speaker C:** Mind? Like, this place was amazing for developing certain things, you know? Like, it's a good environment where I actually practice and talk to you and practice and meditate and do stuff like that and work with people and talk with people who are in similar— like a lot of people here who are like my age or so, or just older people, are still very like— it's really nice to share things and mirror things to each other and work with obstacles we're both experiencing, like those kinds of good friendships here and stuff. Any place like that is really cool. I don't mind so much where I go, but I have no plans at all, and I'm leaving Sunday. And maybe I will go to— I will try to go down to Spain. Maybe I will try to— yeah, maybe I will like hitchhike into London and get into Spain somehow, maybe join another.

**Speaker B:** Temple down there. I don't know how much trouble that it would be, but one of the places that you might want to visit is in Hemel.

**Speaker C:** Hempstead. How far are you from there? Where's Hemel.

**Speaker B:** Hempstead? It's north of London, maybe 100 kilometers or more.

**Speaker C:** North of.

**Speaker B:** London. The name of the wat there is Arahant, Anapanasati.

**Speaker C:** Anicca. Ah, Anagaravati. I sent them an application actually. I don't know if they replied to me. Anagaravati. Ah, no, they haven't replied, but I did send an application like 2.

**Speaker B:** Days ago, but they haven't replied yet. Wow, an.

**Speaker C:** Application. Well.

**Speaker B:** A form, volunteer form. Huh, I don't know what that's about. I have never seen anyone in Thailand ever have to go to a want, but first filling out a piece of.

**Speaker C:** Paper. Well, I would hope to be able to stay there, so they need like things about me, you know, like they need to make sure I'm not.

**Speaker B:** Criminal, so to say, and stuff like that. Uh-huh. Sounds like someone who wrote a bunch of forms is full of fear. They don't want.

**Speaker C:** Dangerous.

**Speaker B:** People there. Yeah. That's, uh, that's unfortunate, but never mind. The question is, is that what would happen if you just showed up? I just said, well, you got to fill out a fill— an application. You say, well, I did fill out the application and I sent it to you already, so you should have my.

**Speaker C:** Application on file. Well, as far as I know, they would reply to me by email saying if they can accept me or not to stay there. And they have like occupied accommodation there for.

**Speaker B:** Whatever, you know. Well, I do know this, that Thai people, uh, and the Thai culture has a lot about, um, formal introductions and word of mouth and all of that kind of stuff. That in fact, I had traveled with papers that Ajahn Po would write out all the time. I didn't know what it was, but I knew that it was a major door opener. All I had to do is give them that piece of paper from Ajahn Po and things were easy. But I don't know how, but that's all with with Thai people. And I assume that Amaravati has gotten kind of Western. The last time I was there, it's been 35 years since I was there, that was a long time ago. But Ajahn Samatha was the abbot at that time. And I knew him from Thailand. So I already had that. In fact, I got to Anagarati because of the invitation that I'd gotten from him personally. So I'm not sure how it would be with Anagarati. And there's also down in the south of England, there's Chithurst, which is also associated with Anagarati. Chithurst. But there are more places, there are more Thai temples There's several big ones, I understand, in London itself. But I would avoid London because of the city. In fact, I like the surroundings that you're at. Being in the forest, being in a garden, is very conducive.

**Speaker C:** To good practice. [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yeah, I'll search, I think, Thai temples.

**Speaker B:** I guess. Yeah. And then, there's the possibility, I don't know what's available in Spain. But you do have Plum Village and some stuff in.

**Speaker C:** France. I sent them one too, haven't.

**Speaker B:** Replied. We'll see, we'll see. Well, one of the things about these Western places that are quasi-Asian, is, is that they're still dealing with COVID Yeah, that COVID is still a big deal. It's still a big deal here in Thailand that people still wear masks out, out in public. Uh, so, uh, that's also affecting the, uh, the various wats and temples throughout the entire West. That many of them have been closed down literally for 2 years or more because of the COVID And in that regard, it's always the lay people who run the temple anyway. That in fact, one of the things that I remember was that at Anagarhanti, there was a lot of Sri Lankan people there. That there's a heavy Sri Lankan influence, even though it's Thai, set up by Achan Chah, But there just happened to have been a lot of Sri Lankan people, and so they started to go to that temple, and it took on a Sri Lankan kind of flavor. But in any case, whether they're Thai people or Sri Lankan people, the lay people are the ones who run the wat. Monks are always just guests, and a monk can pack his bags and walk away. Walk right out almost any time of the year, all except for Pansa, but that's a different point. But in that regard, the monks really don't own the property. They don't have any say-so. They're guests there. And all the bills are paid and all the money is exchanged and all of that is done by lay people. And that's true here.

**Speaker A:** In Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Too. So I don't know what's happening with Anaravanti now because it's been run by lay people for all this.

**Speaker C:** Time. I would say things have changed in.

**Speaker B:** 35 years, Dhamma. Oh really? Well, 35 years ago I was 40 and now I'm 75 and I.

**Speaker C:** Haven'T changed a I was 10 years.

**Speaker B:** Still, still somewhere. Okay, so the kind of question I'm kind of looking at, the kind of question that you're asking, can you be more specific about what your question is? Because you've already been looking around and finding the place places. And so you're not looking for addresses from me. What are.

**Speaker C:** You looking for? Just, you know, like just to deal with the development of getting out of certain beliefs, systems, and patterns about yourself that really feel like they can only be approached by going out into the world and seeing them as they are and actually being able to deal with them full-on. In other words, like, to be more direct, to be able to be looking, get what you want, see things, be able to carry your own shoes, you know, like develop this character's kind of self to be able to be structured by yourself, to be able to be developing really, um, rooted in your own shoes out in reality, like the world, society, so to say. As I've been here for a while, I feel like I've got really far in terms of being, feeling like that within myself despite what's happening outside. So I want to actually go outside and have a more direct experience.

**Speaker B:** That isn't— Give.

**Speaker C:** Me an example. Yes, like traveling down and, you know, traveling alone, so to say, for a while and seeing how that goes and meeting people and developing relationships and having more emotional bonding with people, things that I haven't really actually had in life. Like relationships, yeah, like a lot of relationships with women or friends and family. I didn't have that so much growing up. So this feels like it's just so out of my experience that I feel like I should go towards it and see what's really there. Because, all right, you know, that makes.

**Speaker B:** Sense. Well, like, I have a one-word answer for your question now. Okay, a one-word answer, but it may take a bit of discussion. Okay, the one-word answer is smile. That's what you want to do every time that you remember that wherever you go— because if you're going to be traveling, that means that you're going to be in constant turmoil, constant flux, constant. Wherever you are, it's unfamiliar. And not only that, but you're not going to stay there long enough for it to become familiar. You're on your way to some other.

**Speaker C:** Place that's unfamiliar. I would.

**Speaker B:** Still love you. All right, so, um, if you are in that mentality, then there's going to be some trepidation and some fear. Another way of doing it though, is to not travel with trepidation and fear because of the unknown, and the fear of the unknown. You can travel with enthusiasm. And that's what I'm inviting you to do, is to smile, to have some enthusiasm for your travel, to see everything as a brand new adventure, that nothing is really dangerous here, You might get yourself into an interesting situation, but you can get back out of that interesting situation into another interesting situation. That's easy enough to do, because after all, you're traveling. You can walk away from anything. And so, this is the way that we would approach this, is do it with enthusiasm, not in the sense of looking for something, but finding many, many things. Because you're out traveling, there's going to be a lot of unknown things, a lot of new things to be developed, a lot of new friends to meet. And the best way to meet those people is with a smile and enthusiasm. You don't want anything from them. You're there to spread the joy that the people in the temple that you're in now wish for. That would be the way that I would approach it, okay, is to have that mindfulness to remember that you're in charge of the situation. You're the one who chose to go travel. You're the one who showed up here. You're the boss here. And have been all along. Yeah. And get that confidence going so that you're confident at traveling. Why? Because everybody you meet is a friend. You don't need enemies. And so you meet everyone with a smile, that— and you can easily make friends like that if you bring a smile and enthusiasm to your travel. You'll get enormous benefit out of it.

**Speaker C:** So will others. [Speaker:DM] And what do you think about being able to continue Metta, like practice and, you know, reading, or being able to practice during traveling, so.

**Speaker B:** To say, like— [Speaker:MK] Well, when you're traveling, you're normally on a transport. Like on a bus, or a train, or an airplane, something like that. That's an excellent opportunity to travel, to practice Anapanasati while traveling, mindfully breathing in and out while feeling the bumpy ride that you're on. Become aware of what's happening around you. Pay attention to the outside, senses, rather than paying attention to the outside intellectually, which is actually inside. A lot of people are confused about what's inside and what's outside, but the reality is that what's outside is what comes through your senses: the things you can see, the things you can hear, the things that touch, the bouncing of the train, the clicky-clacky sound of the train, the movement of the stuff outside the windows— this is all real. Thinking about where you're going is not. That's just conceptualizing, because you're going someplace you've never been before. Like, for instance, going to Spain, you think of going to Madrid. Well, maybe you've seen a photo of Madrid, and that's all you know of Madrid. And so we've got photo pictures, we've got images of photos that we have in our mind and we think, "That's Madrid." No, that's not Madrid. You won't know Madrid until you get there. And when you do, Madrid will be expressed through the things you see, the things you hear, the touch of the cloth, the feelings around you, the reality of the situation. And so, when you're in Madrid, experience Madrid instead of thinking about going to Barcelona. In other words, be where you are now. Be there openly, enthusiastically, with a big smile on your face. And you'll.

**Speaker C:** Enjoy your travels. Yeah, most of this was, like the whole intention is kind of, it's like as if everything is under Everything is in the context of what I can do for like the spiritual development, so to say. I feel like I don't know how important it is to do this, but I feel like it's very important to be able to go through this experience, you know, like because of my life, so to say, that I have to go through this experience because of the life I had. And go out that, get out of this chamber of almost as if I'm certain things I hold on to are just always there is because I have never experienced things in life that should be experienced, like good relationships and to be able to like, you know, move around and ask people, go to be able to talk to strangers. Like I was super like very isolated and like beat down, so to say, where I was growing up. So to be able to go around, to be able to talk to strangers, be really open and get out of this shell that I was.

**Speaker B:** In. That sounds marvelous. I really highly recommend that you do that. I very highly recommend that people do travel. That people who stay in one place their whole life only know that one place. Yeah, and that I would say, having been a traveler and done a lot of travel, that it's valuable. I learned more about the United States by being out of the United States than I ever learned about being in the United States. Why? Because I saw alternate ways of doing things, alternate ways of living. But you're also going to, in those travels, meet an awful lot of unhappy people. Yeah. And your job is to not allow their unhappiness to encroach upon your joy and.

**Speaker C:** Enthusiasm. Yeah, that's a big thing. I see sometimes people suffering changes my behavior in a sense. Like, you know, I've heard you say sometimes that— I don't know exactly what you said, but something about having sugar, enough sugar to be able to give it to everyone and not get affected by their suffering, or like don't get caught up in their thing as if it was real in your experience, or more see it as it is, be able to— it's compassion or something, I think you said. It was It's like deep compassion is actually having enough sugar to be able to give those people who are really unhappy some sugar too, or something like that. I don't know if that was what you.

**Speaker B:** Said. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds correct, exactly so. Right, a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. Okay, and that one song is actually quite valuable to understand that We don't want to take our medicine, we don't want to see what's real. We resist it. And so, offering that teaspoon of sugar will help the medicine go down, when you start living Dhamma in front of them, they can see it, because they can see the results of your Dhamma, is joy and enthusiasm. Now that joy— or another word for joy would be in fact the word delight. In the Pali, there's two words for delight. One is nandi and the other one is rato. So nandi is delight, to become delightful and delighted with your travels, because your travels are the Dhamma. Become delighted with the Dharma, joyful and enthusiastic or eager for it. These are signs of good practice. Yes. Joyful, exuberant, enthusiastic, delighted— these are the results of good practice. Not the final results, but an excellent intermediate result. And so that's my best advice for you: smile. Smile. Smile. Smile at the ugly, smile at the beautiful, smile at the ordinary. If people ask you for money, give them money and smile. If they ask for your advice, give them advice and smile. If they ask you to take a hike, smile on.

**Speaker C:** Your way.

**Speaker B:** Out. Okay, okay. That'll keep you out of.

**Speaker C:** Trouble a lot. So I don't know how it's going to go, but I mean, I don't have nothing else to do but to see it when it happens, you know, no.

**Speaker B:** Worries. Well, there's a younger child in me who wants to go with you. But the old Dhamma dude wants to just sit here and.

**Speaker C:** Hear about it. I mean, I look at people like you and your qualities and so to say, and you're like the way I feel about you, and that's who I want to develop towards to be able to.

**Speaker B:** Be. Well, you're already there. You've already got.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations. You're already.

**Speaker C:** A Buddha Dasha. Well, I've only begun reading Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's books in the last couple of weeks. So I think I've just feel like I just maybe might just started like stepping up very long, long, long mountainous stairs that seems to be like covered in mystical.

**Speaker B:** Fog. It's not a long mountain of stairs, it's just this step. It's just one step. Just take this step, and if you find another step, then take that one. But don't visualize in your mind about a whole great long set of The fear is there because you don't know. It's not daunting. That's the attitude of a victim. The attitude of a winner is, oh, I could.

**Speaker C:** Take another.

**Speaker B:** Step. Yes, exactly. Why should you worry about feeling as good as I do when you already feel that way right now anyway? The path is that easy, just one step at a time. This step, that's the only thing that we have to deal with.

**Speaker C:** Is this.

**Speaker B:** One. This step, yes. This step, take it happily, enjoy the practice, watch.

**Speaker C:** Where you're stepping. I feel like this advice is— or this understanding of one thing at a time, or what's there, if I can really hold that in mind when I'm traveling, I know, like, I've really thought about that. It's so like— that has been so like ripening feeling, like experience, like it's really ripened, this, just what's here and now, like one thing at a time. It's really nice. So curious what's gonna happen when I go to travel, you.

**Speaker B:** Know? [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] What ripens is the Samma Sanghappa, what ripens is our attitude, what ripens is that our confidence that we can do this. Yes. We can do it. You can handle it. You can go travel and meet the world and have fun doing it, enthusiastically, with a big smile. You.

**Speaker C:** Can do it. Can I ask you something about.

**Speaker B:** Play? Yes.

**Speaker C:** Please do. Play. Oh, this might get a bit noisy. There's a big-ass crane.

**Speaker B:** Coming right.

**Speaker C:** Now. Yeah, it might get a bit noisy. Yeah. Oh my God, I.

**Speaker B:** Might die here. There's a— Well, we can play with it. No, it's not so noisy for— You've got good sound cancelling, I.

**Speaker C:** Think, on your— Yeah, someone here in this place really reflected, like they really were almost a mirror when they were like super playful. They were acting very playful and I inside myself was like, whoa, I feel really resisting this part of me, like this playful child. And I started to really investigate what is that feeling. It's as if I started to really, really investigate.

**Speaker B:** It. It's like, wow, I really can't.

**Speaker C:** Play. Like, I cannot play. And it's like, this is such a struggle. It's almost like I'm not allowed to play. And it's like a super unbelievably restricting feeling where all of this, like, very embarrassing to not be seen, worrying what people think, feelings rushing to me. And it's like, don't do that, don't do that. I so deep down, deeply, deeply want to learn how to play again, because I started to remember, wow, when I was a child I was so playful. And then throughout my life I started to like get beat down into taking things extremely seriously, and like pushing this part of me away that's desperate to be like, come, come out.

**Speaker B:** Again, you know? Mm-hmm. That's— okay, so getting that playfulness back is done with the enthusiasm, with the joy, and also to remember that it's okay for you to play. Yes, the playfulness was beaten out of you before, but that people who beat it out of you are not around anymore. They're not there. You do not have to follow their rules. You can be playful now. You're the boss here. So the thing to do before you leave, if you haven't left yet, is to go seek this guy out, this playful, and talk to him about playfulness and see what he has to say. Go use him as a mentor. Allow him to be playful and show you that it's safe.

**Speaker C:** To be.

**Speaker B:** Playful. Yes, he may not know what you're talking about because he was naturally playful. Yeah, because he never had it beat out of him. But the likelihood is, is that he is revisiting because he felt that way too. That's very common in our culture for the playfulness to get beat out.

**Speaker C:** Of us. Yeah, yeah, I have. I think I, I should really try to be around people who are, who can play and.

**Speaker B:** Learn from that. Yes, if you can't seek out nobles, at least seek out.

**Speaker C:** People who playful. Yes, well, that's the best, the.

**Speaker B:** Best. So they're on their way to Noble, one playful step at a time. So this has got the same theme, isn't it? It's very interesting. Yeah, the one word that I gave you, and we've been talking about it for about an hour, has to to do with smile, play, enthusiasm. And now you're telling me that you've got a really good example, so go spend some time with him. Let as much of his playfulness as possible rub off on you so you've got a weaker, more supply. But when you.

**Speaker C:** Leave the place— yeah, yeah, there's quite a bit, there's quite a bit to work on. But it's really just what you're saying, like, it's just one thing to do in a sense, is is the moment, this moment, smiling in this moment, step and step, but just, yeah, it's.

**Speaker B:** Not so— That's all we've got. That's the only thing that's important, is being alive, right here, right now. Nothing.

**Speaker C:** Else is important. Yeah, and I can see it will take, it will take more time for me to understand, like, to get into a point where maybe meditation can take more Anapanasati, I can more understand it. Because I can see it takes, it's quite a developmental thing maybe to understand it more and more and more, like how Anapanasati works in meditation, the Jhanas. I don't, I think it was just, it's gonna unfold more as I become.

**Speaker B:** Happier. The unfolding comes with the skills. And you've got 4 primary skills to develop. One is to remember, to look, to investigate. Number 3 is to make a change. Number 4 is to congratulate yourself for the change. That's an easy way of talking about it, is to pay attention to what you're doing, and then gladden the mind, brighten it up, put a smile on, put some enthusiasm in it, and say, "Hey, I can do this." We practice those things over and over and over again with great repetition, and out traveling is a really good opportunity to do it. Those are the skills, just those 4 skills. Get them up to skill level. Being a loser is a bad habit. Being a winner is a skill. Joy is a skill to be developed. Happiness is a skill to be developed. Satisfaction is a skill.

**Speaker C:** To be developed. Takes some time. I've really quite a lot of.

**Speaker B:** Things— Well, do it again, do it again. It doesn't take a lot of time. You just do it again right now. I'm getting you out of that habit. Don't look at it as off in the future. Look at it right now. This is it. You can do it. I know you.

**Speaker C:** Can do it. Right, right on, right on, right.

**Speaker B:** On. Okay, okay, okay. See that little subtle switch? From always in the future, I don't have it now, I'm poor me, I'm a victim, into hey, I got it, I got it, this is.

**Speaker C:** It. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So the final advice is go make friends with this playful guy. Learn a couple of things from him. I'm sure he's got something.

**Speaker C:** To teach you. I will, I will see how it goes. I'll talk to you after I travel. I don't know where I'll be next Thursday, but I'll still have to.

**Speaker B:** Hopefully be able to be on. All you need is an internet connection, and I hear that those are easy enough to come by. So we'll see you next.

**Speaker C:** Week. Okay, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato. This has been great. This has been really great. I've really enjoyed our.

**Speaker C:** Conversation. Thank.

**Speaker B:** You so.

**Speaker C:** Much. Arhat. Cool. I'll see.

**Speaker B:** You. Okay.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends Dean and Kath, covers several practical and philosophical topics in a conversational, accessible style. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Main Themes & Advice**

1.  **Monastic Life & Offerings:** A student (Dean) asks if monks eat meat. Dhammarato clarifies that monks in the Theravada tradition eat whatever food is offered by laypeople, as they are not vegetarian by rule. The emphasis is on gratitude and non-attachment to the food itself.

2.  **The Role & Value of Chanting:**
    *   Dhammarato explains he doesn't often prescribe chanting because it's hard to learn online, but he affirms its significant value.
    *   **Benefits:** It focuses the mind, suppresses unwholesome thoughts, and prepares the mind for sitting meditation.
    *   **Historical Context:** In the Buddha's time, chanting was the primary method for transmitting and memorizing the Dhamma. The numerical lists in the teachings (like the 4 Noble Truths, 8fold Path) are **memory aids**, not signs of complexity.
    *   He mentions he has even written a book on chanting to preserve the practice.

3.  **Visiting a Monastery (Wat):** Dhammarato gives Dean practical advice on the best time to visit a local wat (late morning, around 11 am) to participate in rituals and meet the abbot. He emphasizes that simply being in the environment and meeting people has value, even if plans don't work out perfectly.

4.  **The "Rub-off" Effect of Noble Friends:** Dean asks what he might gain just from being around noble people (ariyas). Dhammarato's simple answer: their cheerfulness and happiness will naturally rub off. The environment itself is a teacher.

5.  **Critique of Some Western Buddhist Groups:** In conversation with Kath, who is staying at a modern "Kadampa" (Tibetan) center run by Westerners, Dhammarato draws a distinction:
    *   **Theravada in the West:** Typically maintains Asian leadership and cultural continuity.
    *   **Some Westernized Vajrayana Groups:** Often led by Westerners, can become detached from original roots and, in his view, overly "magical" or focused on visualization and prayer. He observes that the effectiveness of a system can be gauged by the long-term well-being of its practitioners.

6.  **Core Practical Dhamma Advice (for Kath's upcoming travel):** This forms the heart of the talk. Kath plans to travel to develop life experience and confront inner fears.
    *   **The One-Word Answer: SMILE.** Dhammarato advises approaching all new experiences—travel, strangers, uncertainty—with enthusiasm and a smile. This frames the journey as an adventure, not a trial.
    *   **Be Present:** Experience each place directly through your senses (sights, sounds, touch) rather than through preconceptions or worries about the next destination.
    *   **You Are the Boss:** Cultivate confidence. You chose this path; meet the world as a friend, not a threat.
    *   **Practice While Traveling:** Use transport time for Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). Practice metta (loving-kindness) by being a joyful, friendly presence.
    *   **Compassion as "Sugar":** Have enough inner joy ("sugar") to share with unhappy people without being pulled into their suffering.

7.  **Re-learning Playfulness:** Kath shares an insight about having his natural playfulness "beaten out" of him. Dhammarato encourages him to:
    *   Seek out playful people and let their attitude rub off.
    *   Understand that the old, restrictive rules don't apply anymore. **"You're the boss here."**
    *   See playfulness, joy, and enthusiasm as **skills** to be developed through practice, not distant goals.

8.  **The Path is One Step at a Time:** Dhammarato repeatedly brings the focus back to the present moment.
    *   Don't visualize the path as a daunting, endless staircase. It's just **this one step**.
    *   The four key skills are: **Remembering (mindfulness), Looking, Investigating, Making a Change, and Congratulating yourself** for the change.
    *   Shift from the mindset of a victim ("I can't yet") to a winner ("I can do this right now").

### **Overall Tone & Message**
The talk is encouraging, pragmatic, and focused on applying Dhamma to everyday life challenges—social anxiety, travel, finding a community, and cultivating joy. Dhammarato emphasizes **direct experience, personal agency, and the development of happiness as a skill** over doctrinal complexity or ritual. The core message is to meet all of life's moments with a gladdened mind, a smile, and the confident understanding that the path of practice is always right here, in the present step.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and life advice. Here are the key ones:

### Metaphors
1.  **Chanting as a "Memory Aid" / "Preparation":**
    *   Speaker B compares the numerical lists in Buddhist teachings (like the 4 Noble Truths, 8fold Path) to **memory aids**. He explains they are not meant to make the Dharma complicated, but are simple tools to help remember, like a mnemonic device.
    *   He also uses the metaphor of chanting as **preparing the soil or mind** for meditation. Just as you prepare ground for planting, evening chanting "helps prepare the mind for the sitting meditation" by focusing it and fostering wholesome thoughts.

2.  **Sugar Helping Medicine Go Down:**
    *   This is a central metaphor for **compassion and joyful practice**. Speaker B says that having enough personal joy ("sugar") allows you to interact with suffering people without being dragged down, and even to help them by sharing that joyful attitude. Your happiness makes the "medicine" of reality easier for others to swallow.

3.  **The Long Mountain of Stairs vs. The Single Step:**
    *   Speaker C describes the spiritual path as a "long, long, long mountainous stair" shrouded in fog, which feels daunting.
    *   Speaker B counters this with the metaphor of **taking just one step**. He emphasizes that the path isn't a distant, intimidating climb, but the simple, manageable step right in front of you. The focus should be on the present step, taken with joy.

4.  **"Rubbing Off" Like Cheerfulness:**
    *   When asked about the benefit of being around noble people (the Sangha), Speaker B uses the simple metaphor of qualities **"rubbing off."** If a person is cheerful and happy, simply by being near them, that cheer and happiness can transfer to you.

5.  **Visualized Deities as "Ideal Qualities":**
    *   When discussing Tibetan Buddhist visualization practices, Speaker B reframes the deities not as "magic beings" but as **"ideal qualities" or "ideal states."** This metaphor shifts the focus from external beings to internal attributes one cultivates.

### Stories & Anecdotes
1.  **Story of Chanting and Book Writing:**
    *   Speaker B tells a personal story about defending a chanting master monk named **Maha Samsara**. This defense led him to write "The Complete Book of Pauli Chanting." He uses this story to show that despite not emphasizing chanting often, he deeply values it and has contributed to its practice.

2.  **Story of Historical Dhamma Transmission:**
    *   Speaker B recounts how **in the Buddha's time, before books**, the Dhamma was preserved through chanting and memorization. Students would memorize passages, then discuss them word-by-word. This story explains the origin and traditional purpose of chanting as a vital tool for preservation and deep learning.

3.  **Anecdote about the Dalai Lama and Buddhadasa:**
    *   He mentions a video where **the Dalai Lama calls Bhikkhu Buddhadasa his "elder brother."** This brief story is used to establish the respect and authoritative lineage of his (Speaker B's) teaching tradition, contrasting it with the group Speaker C is staying with.

4.  **Personal Travel and Temple Anecdotes:**
    *   Speaker B shares several brief anecdotes from his life:
        *   Using **handwritten notes from Ajahn Po as "door openers"** at temples, illustrating Thai cultural norms.
        *   His experience **35 years ago at Amaravati monastery** in the UK, noting how it was run then versus his suspicions about how it might be run now by laypeople.
        *   The observation that in the West, **Theravada temples are usually run by Asian monastics**, while Tibetan centers are often run by Westerners, which he uses to highlight a difference in authenticity and cultural connection.

5.  **The "Playful Guy" Anecdote:**
    *   Speaker C shares a story about meeting a **playful person at the center** who acted as a mirror, revealing Speaker C's own deep resistance to playfulness. This personal story becomes the basis for the discussion on reclaiming joy and serves as a practical example of learning from others.

**In summary**, the talk uses **metaphors of preparation, aid, and simple steps** to explain practice, and **personal stories and historical anecdotes** to illustrate principles, establish credibility, and provide relatable examples for overcoming personal obstacles. The overarching theme is cultivating **joy, enthusiasm, and present-moment focus** as the path itself.
