### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And we'll do that recording.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So I joined a chanting practice yesterday and it was the first time. So I just sat there and listened to the chants.

**Speaker A:** That's the important thing is sit there and listen. All right. They may or may not have a book that has the chanting in it.

**Speaker B:** No, I didn't get one.

**Speaker A:** All right, then you can go online to our Open Sangha Foundation, go to the PDFs, and key the word for chanting, and you will find chanting books there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** There's one that's really, really a big one that has almost all the chants, and then there's a smaller one from some wat. So go ahead and get both of the chanting books and look at it. The big book, you might— in fact, they normally do the morning chant and the evening chant as kind of a standard. Okay, the morning chant and the evening chant is in that big chanting book. So the way that I would recommend it, rather than printing it out bridging it out is to read over the morning and the evening chants, then go to the chanting, and then come back and read it over again in the book. Okay, back and forth and back and forth, rather than trying to sit there with the book and listen to what they're saying. And that's a bit difficult.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. It's sort of like learning to read music while you're in a band. Yeah, okay, we're not going to try to learn to read music while we're in the band. We're going to work on reading the music outside, and then when the band is playing, we listen very closely. Okay, you'll begin to pick it up because they say the same thing every day. Don't be hard on yourself because every one of those Bhikkhunis had to go through this process Herself.

**Speaker B:** Wow, okay, yes, yes, you're right. And so I should also make an effort to show up for the morning chanting session, because so far I haven't been able to show up that early.

**Speaker A:** Well, don't bother to mumble along with them, but when they do reach a phrase or a line that you know, then you can say that along with them. And then when they start talking or chanting something that you don't know, it's okay to be quiet. It's much more important to listen to what they're saying than it is to try to mimic what they're saying.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, all right. And good. Also, I'm gonna be staying here at the temple for 15 days. That's what I was told I could stay, but I don't know, do you think it's possible to stay more days? Well, I don't know how that works.

**Speaker A:** The more you fit in, the better that you like the place, the much more likely they'll allow you to stay. They will tell everybody 15 days in the beginning is almost kind of a test.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? Okay.

**Speaker A:** But that 15 days doesn't mean anything to the Bhikkhunis, but it does put you under pressure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I inviting you to come right back out of that pressure.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Don'T pressure yourself over 15 days.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's good. And I also I don't speak Sinhalese.

**Speaker A:** Sinhalese is the language that they're saying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, but they're more likely to learn a little English than you are to learn Sinhalese. Yeah. OK, if you're staying there for a long time, then it might be a good idea for you to start learning Sinhalese. The beautiful part of Sinhalese is that it's an Indo-European language. And easier to learn than Thai.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Really. Thai is a hard language to learn because of the Japanese, of the Chinese, the tonalities and all of that kind of stuff. But Sinhalese is actually going to be easier for you to learn or pick up.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Okay, I didn't know that. Sounds very difficult to me. Okay, and so when I was coming here from India, they told me, they gave me a visa for Sri Lanka only for 30 days. And I don't know if you know or you have any recommendation if I want to stay longer Regarding the visa.

**Speaker A:** I don't know much of anything about the Sri Lankan visas, but I do know that many years ago when I got Sri Lankan visas, they were for 3 months.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** Okay, but could be extended. So if you are getting along well and you can make it past 15 days to 30 days, then I'm sure that you can get a paper or something from one of the Bhikkhunis that will put a good word in for you. That will make the visa extensions quite easy.

**Speaker B:** Wow, okay, okay, that's good to know. Okay, and, um, um, yeah, I think those were my questions. I didn't have that much questions at all.

**Speaker A:** That's all right, you got— you're just fine. So you continue to practice Anapanasati like we discussed, according to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and your walking meditation.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Don't get too focused. If you get too focused, then I'm not sure about it. But in Thailand, they have a walking path that's bounded. It's about 20 meters. And when you get to one end, you turn around and walk back. Oh wow, rather than just out walking and walking and walking and walking wherever, they actually have a bounded place that you walk this far, 20 meters, turn around and walk back 20 meters.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, which is 60 feet. That's actually quite a big amount. Yes, fairly long. But if you're too focused, say, on the nose tip, you can miss that boundary. And just keep walking because you're not paying attention. That in fact what we really need to do is to make sure that you're here now, that you're paying attention to what, what's happening with that walking meditation. You're not stepping on any of the— you're not stepping on snakes or Bhikkhunis or anything like that. You're doing it barefoot, so you got to watch where you're going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's that. To repeat that. That's the important thing, is to be here in the present moment rather than thinking about Mexico or thinking about the visa or worried about this, that, and the other thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. And I also remember I wanted to ask you, because I'm so new to the practices I don't quite understand the difference between Vipassana and Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Well, when Vipassana is practiced well, it is Anapanasati. And for sure, when Anapanasati is practiced correctly, it is Vipassana. Okay, now the word Vipassana You can see the word passage or passing in there. And Vipassana is talked about in the sense of insight. The word vi means in or going into, like the word vihara means in the heart, which is the same thing as in the home. So when the Bhikkhuni are in the bhavana, they're in their home. And so the word "vi," Vipassana, actually does not necessarily mean insight in the way that Westerners think of insight. It's not a very good translation. A better way of using the word Vipassana is to look at what you're doing. Watch what's going on. Begin to get some insight into the nature of reality right in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The Vipassana crowd, they make a great big deal out of Vipassana, as if they work and work and work for days, months, and years, and then they'll have an insight. But that insight, if it took that long, it took way too long because they weren't looking at all. And then the worst part of it is, is that once they've had the insight, they think, okay, I'm finished now, rather than taking that insight and applying it over and over again right here in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yes. Oh. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** OK, so really Vipassana is— there's not much to it if you're practicing Anapanasati correctly. You're not missing out on something that a whole bunch of people say they're doing, Vipassana, that in fact, more than likely when they're practicing Vipassana, they're not practicing Anapanasati. And that means that they're not practicing the teachings of the Buddha correctly. They're looking for something. They're looking for insight. Rather than looking for this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Good to understand that.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now, one last thing about Vipassana is that, guess what? It's not in the original suttas in the time of the Buddha. The word Vipassana got famous after that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

**Speaker A:** There's a big— there's a big controversy in modern Buddhism between Vipassana and Samatha. But in some of the sutras, it says if you have one and not the other, then go get the other one. And if you don't have either one, get them both together at the same time. Okay, now what Samatha means in that case is at rest, at peace, at home, being calm. All right. And the example of that would be imagine that you've got a video camera. Nowadays they have a cell phone. All right. And the example is, is that these guys with their cell phones are video recording an avalanche. And they continue to record the avalanche until they figure out that the avalanche is right on them, it's coming. Okay, and then the cell phone video is all over the place. You can't watch it, they're not going to hold the camera still, they're too busy running.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Vipassana in reality can only be done when you are calm. Yes, this is why the cameras are often really good cameras, and really good photographers, they'll put the camera on a tripod for stability.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So think of Samatha as the tripod and think of Vipassana as the camera. And that's why you have to use them together. The tripod's not going to help you, but the camera moving all over the place is not going to help you. You have to have that stable mind in order to see correctly.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is very— it's clear. For me, that out.

**Speaker A:** Okay, would you go have fun with your walking meditation? This is why they want you to walk slowly, is because that will help to develop that stability that we're looking for. Slow and easy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like it.

**Speaker A:** Then you can see really well.

**Speaker B:** It seems like they're walking on slow camera, like step in lifting the feet and then you don't have to pay.

**Speaker A:** Too much attention to the rocking of the feet and whatnot like that, that if you're too focused on that, you'll wind up moving the foot correctly and then stepping right on a Bhikkhuni. Yeah, so there's more to it than how you lift the foot. I've heard, in fact, that there is 7 that you lift the heel, then your toe, and then you raise it in the air, and then you move it, and then you put the toe down, and then the heel down. And while you're doing that, you just stepped on somebody.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I, I think that could happen.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we're looking for an open awareness that we can focus and see what's real, as opposed to having the mind just all over the place. Because it's possible that you're not watching how you're moving your feet and still step on the Bhikkhuni because you're not watching anything at all. Yeah, that's the normal life that people have. And so by focusing, we wind up having to focus on what's real, including the Satipatthana. You have to look at where you're going, what the body is doing, and we can move back and forth between them. The Buddha talked about it in the sense of one by one as they occur. One by one as they occur. Pay attention to things as they come up.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So as you're about to put that foot down, be sure you know where you're going to put it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, Anna, it's really glad for you to be in Sri Lanka. I'm glad you called.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm glad to talk to you, and I hope I can give you another call soon to let you know how I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, call me.

**Speaker B:** All right. Have a good day, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you have a good day.

**Speaker B:** All right. Bye. Thank you.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a practitioner (Speaker B) who is new to a temple in Sri Lanka:

### **Summary of Dhamma Talk**

The conversation is a practical and instructional dialogue, focusing on integrating into temple life and clarifying meditation practice.

**1. Advice on Temple Integration:**
*   **Chanting:** The practitioner is advised not to try to chant along immediately but to **listen attentively**. They are encouraged to study the chanting texts (available online) separately and then listen during sessions, gradually joining in on familiar parts. The process is compared to learning music separately from playing in a band.
*   **Length of Stay:** The initial 15-day stay permission is described as a standard test period. The advice is to relax, fit in well, and not pressure oneself about it. Staying longer is likely if one integrates harmoniously.
*   **Language & Visa:** While learning Sinhalese is encouraged for long stays (and noted as easier than Thai), communication in English is often possible. For visa extensions beyond 30 days, a recommendation letter from the Bhikkhunis (nuns) at the temple would be helpful.

**2. Core Meditation Instructions:**
*   **Walking Meditation:** The primary instruction is to **maintain present-moment awareness** during walking meditation. The goal is not an overly narrow focus on foot mechanics (which can cause one to miss their surroundings), but a balanced, open awareness of the body and environment to avoid hazards and stay grounded in the *here and now*.
*   **Anapanasati vs. Vipassana:** A significant portion clarifies these often-confused terms:
    *   **They are fundamentally linked:** When practiced correctly, *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing) **is** *Vipassana* (insight), and vice-versa.
    *   **Critique of "Vipassana":** Dhammarato cautions against the modern tendency to treat Vipassana as a separate, long-term practice aimed at a future "insight." He states the term is not found in the original suttas in this specialized way and that seeking insight *outside* the present moment is incorrect practice.
    *   **Samatha & Vipassana as a Pair:** The necessary qualities are **Samatha** (tranquility, stability) and **Vipassana** (clear seeing). Using an analogy, *Samatha* is the stable tripod, and *Vipassana* is the camera. **Insight can only occur with a calm, stable mind.** The Buddha's path requires developing both together.

**3. Overall Theme:**
The talk emphasizes **practicality, patience, and present-moment awareness**. The advice is to relax into the temple routine, practice *Anapanasati* and walking meditation with a balanced, open awareness (not forced concentration), and understand that true insight (*Vipassana*) arises naturally from a calm (*Samatha*), mindful observation of the present reality, not from striving for a special experience.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain concepts:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Learning Chanting is like "Learning to read music while you're in a band."**
    *   **Purpose:** To advise against trying to follow the chant book in real-time during the session. Instead, he suggests studying separately (like practicing sheet music alone) and then listening attentively during the group practice (like listening to the band play).

2.  **The 15-day stay is "almost kind of a test."**
    *   **Purpose:** To reframe the initial permission period. It's not a fixed limit but a probationary period to see if the visitor fits in. The metaphor of a "test" explains the temple's policy and encourages the student to relax into the experience rather than feel pressure.

3.  **Samatha (tranquility) and Vipassana (insight) are like a "Camera and a Tripod."**
    *   **Samatha as the Tripod:** Represents the stable, calm, and steady foundation of the mind.
    *   **Vipassana as the Camera:** Represents the act of seeing clearly, gaining insight, or recording the truth.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that true insight (Vipassana) is only possible when the mind is calm and stable (Samatha). One without the other is ineffective—a shaky camera (agitated mind) yields a useless video, and a tripod alone (calm but unobservant mind) sees nothing.

4.  **A mind lacking focus is like someone frantically "video recording an avalanche" with a cell phone.**
    *   **Purpose:** This story-within-a-metaphor vividly depicts the state of a panicked, unfocused mind. The video (the insight) is chaotic and useless because the person (the mind) is not calm (Samatha). This reinforces why stability is necessary for clear seeing.

### **Stories / Anecdotal Examples**

1.  **The Story of Over-Focused Walking Meditation:**
    *   **Content:** He recounts the prescribed, highly detailed method of walking meditation (lifting heel, toe, etc., in seven steps) and then humorously concludes, "And while you're doing that, you just stepped on somebody."
    *   **Purpose:** To warn against hyper-focusing on one small technique to the exclusion of open, present-moment awareness. The story emphasizes that the ultimate goal is mindful awareness of the entire environment, not just the mechanics of the foot.

2.  **The Historical Anecdote about Vipassana:**
    *   **Content:** He states, "It's not in the original suttas in the time of the Buddha. The word Vipassana got famous after that." He then describes the modern "big controversy" between Vipassana and Samatha, contrasting it with the Buddha's integrated approach.
    *   **Purpose:** To demystify Vipassana and correct a common modern misconception. This brief historical narrative supports his argument that Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), when done correctly, naturally contains both calm (Samatha) and insight (Vipassana).

### **Summary of Rhetorical Purpose:**
Dhammarato uses these metaphors and stories to make abstract Buddhist principles (**calm, insight, mindfulness, practice**) concrete, relatable, and memorable. They often serve to **correct common misunderstandings** (about Vipassana, about striving for insight) and to **prioritize practical, present-moment awareness** over rigid technique or intellectual striving. The tone is pedagogical, gentle, and often humorous, using everyday imagery (cameras, bands, tests) to guide the student.
