### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello folks. Good morning, Christina, and good day to a lot of you. Today is Sunday afternoon here in Thailand at a little after 4 PM, and today we'll start to talk with something that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talked about fairly often and gave more than one full Dhamma talk to, and that is looking at things from two different kinds of languages because there are two different ways of looking at the world or reality or whatever. And that is ordinary reality that we were all raised in, the society and all of that. And then there is the noble way of looking. And so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about ordinary language versus Dhamma language. Now, one of the interesting things that he said about it was ordinary language can be thought of or seen as a balloon. To where noble language or Dhamma language, you can see it as a knife. Now, why would he say that? Well, the balloon is actually a plaything. We like balloons, but they are temporary, subject to popping. And often when the balloon pops, people become disappointed. But the knife language is quite telling in the sense that the knife language is used to cut things open, to diagnose, and that getting into it Now, within ordinary language, they talk about meditation in the sense of going deep. But using knife language, let me ask you this question: cutting a loaf of bread, you just cut it. You don't cut deep into the loaf of bread, you just merely cut right through it. So this is also the way of ordinary language. People think of going deep into the mind or going deep into meditation to where that's an ordinary way of looking as if there was no end to it. So one of the ways that we can talk about that would be How far can you go into the forest? Can you go deep into the forest? No, the farthest you can go into the forest is halfway. You can only go halfway because any further is getting closer back to the edge again. And so this is an example then of in ordinary language, they talk about going deep into meditation or things. But in the Dhamma language, we just merely cut right through. And so there's many different kinds of words that actually get their meaning turned upside down. And one of the words that would get turned upside down with Dharma language would be the word distraction. Another way of looking at it is that ordinary language is always concerned with self in relationship to the world, like I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm frustrated, I'm this, I'm that. And that in Dharma language, we would think of it in the sense of there is frustration, there is hunger, there is tiredness, but there is no me in there. And so it's a completely new way of looking and a new way of speaking. Now, one of the qualities then of distraction is that People in the ordinary sense think that they are on a track. We could use the word derailed in the sense of they're on a rail, they're on a railroad going someplace, and that that's the way that we begin to look at it. In the Dhamma language, we don't want to go any place. So we want to distract, we want to derail rather than being distracted. And so we think that, oh well, practicing Dhamma is that, and when I'm not practicing Dhamma, I'm being derailed. The better way of looking at it is that you want to be derailed from the unwholesome, being derailed from the ordinary. And so if you have a thought that you would call a distraction, what is it distracting from? Well, in a way, it's distracting from what you want to think. Well, why don't we derail then that derailing thought and derail it that way in the sense of let's get out of the ordinary old track and come off of that track into something new, into something wholesome. So Bhikkhu Buddhadasa used that kind of language to wake people up, to get them to see that there is a better way of talking, a better way of looking a better way of speaking. Now, yesterday I talked about this, and I wanted to mention it again today, that ordinary language is very self-oriented. You look at all of the ways that the English language especially is set up, it is set up to use the pronouns of I, me, and my quite a lot. There is a— actually, throughout the West, there are things called baby showers. Christina and Catherine, have you ever been to a baby shower? Okay. A baby shower often has a game. And the game that they play is that the ladies can talk and do whatever they want to do, but they can't use the word baby. Have you ever played that game, Christina?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a lot of fun. A lot of people lose very quickly.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and that's because they're not mindful. So what— and not only that, but it is a lot of fun. Because everybody laughs when the word baby comes up. Now, I would like to introduce that in a fun way so that we can begin to watch our language. Now, in a way, you could say the mind comes first. The Buddha said the mind is the forerunner for all action. But beginners in practice are not, let us say, skilled at watching the mind, that it often gets into verbal and even into written language, that they're using 'I,' 'me,' and 'mine.' So what I would suggest is for each one of you to begin to play the game of changing the voice of your written language or even your spoken language, change the voice, change the articles, etc., so as to remove the 'I,' 'me,' and 'mine.' That will help you to remember, or in a way start to become mindful. So instead of saying, 'I saw a duck,' you could say, 'There is a duck.' The duck was seen, rather than I, me, my. You see, our language is very oriented like that, and one of the ways to help us gain mindfulness is by taking I, me, and my out of the language. You could say, here is a duck. This would be better, and it takes a bit of skill to start writing that way, especially on Discord. We've got a group. We can think of the Discord group as kind of a baby shower, and they're going to start playing this game of, uh, you can't use the word I, me, mine, or self-reference. It's almost okay. In fact, you could get away with using it in the sense of the royal we or medical doctors. We use we because that'll help us come out of I-centricness. So back to the word distraction. What we want to do is we want to distract ourselves from using the I, me, and mine, and start to pay close attention to what we're saying, what we're writing, with the intention of starting to watch what the mind is doing. So Jonas was asking about this in the sense of he's he sees a train of thought and that he wants to do— uh, he sees that train of thought as a distraction. Actually, it's a train already on the rails. What you want to do is derail those thoughts every time that they get up on the rail and start moving. We want to derail those. This is— we want to use derailing and distracting in a Dhamma sense, because the normal track is ordinary. The normal track leads to Dukkha. The normal track is something to be avoided. And so by watching the mind and watching the way that the mind is working, we can in fact make that right noble effort to distract the mind from that. That is, in other words, if there are ordinary thoughts, we can call them ordinary thoughts, but when we have those ordinary thoughts over and over and over and over again, that's like grinding them in. That's like cutting a groove or cutting a track, and they're not wholesome. They lead us into the same old, same old, as opposed to remembering to watch those. Now, I know that it's quite common within the Western mentality who, when they're first introduced to Buddhism, they always see it as a meditation in the sense of someone sitting there doing as little or nothing as they can, holding their posture still, etc., like that. But really, the practice of Anapanasati is quite dynamic. Wherever you are, wherever you go, that right then is your opportunity to practice. And when you're sick, when the body is in pain or ailing, that's the best time to practice. When the mind is on track, on a trail, the best time to practice is by derailing or distracting that thought and coming back into a wholesome God right then and there. But this is immediately available. There's a story that I have that Kat had a conversation with a well-known Dharma teacher from England who said that she sees defilements often and she wants to know what to do about it. She thinks that what I need to do— what she needs to do is to go deep into meditation, hoping that deep in meditation is going to help her to come out of her defiling thoughts. The answer to that is not— you don't need to go into deep meditation. The defilement is there. What we need to do is right then and there distract the mind from that defilement. This is the actual teachings of the Buddha, not to go deep into meditation, but to practice right here, right now, to change that. Now, someone else asked a question. About, um, how, how do we do this? How do we remember it? Well, there's several things that we can look at from that. One of them, the most important in fact, is to start watching. Remember to look. Continue to remember to look, to, um to settle the mind down so that it can be seen. You could say, in fact, that the mind in the ordinary sense is distracted by all kinds of things, but it just gets on a track, and what we need to do is derail that. Now, one of the ways that we can do this also is by being around noble friends who will point this out, that one of the qualities of the noble friends is— well, there's two qualities. One, you can see the action of the noble friend and imitate that action. But the other one is, is that beware that a noble is more than likely going to be telling the truth, that that's another quality of this Dhamma language versus ordinary language is that in ordinary language, anything goes. Here's the funny point about it, is that everybody from their childhood has been told that you should be honest, you should be telling the truth. Nobody does that. And yet when people talk, We believe them as if they were honest. And so here we have a whole society of dishonest liars that believe each other. Isn't that amazing? And yet, when we start speaking in Dhamma language, we become be dedicated to seeing things clearly, to see reality as it is, and to speak in reality. And if the reality is, is that there is no self except when, um, uh, there is, uh, attachment or Upadana, when the self comes up, we don't want to refer to the self as the self. We want to eliminate it, to break it immediately. And so coming out of language that uses I, me, or my means now that you're using much more honest language. This is why it's called a knife language also, is because it cuts. Sometimes it is painful to see the truth. You know, Jesus once said, ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Well, uh, I forgot her name now. Uh, Gloria Steinem, who was a New York journalist, she added something to that, but when she was confronted with it years later, she says, oh no, not me, I didn't do it. But what she said was, ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, but first it's going to really piss you off. And so if you see something, recognize that you may not like it so much because it's been against all the lies that you've been told. But in fact, that's basically what the Dhamma language and what the Dhamma will do for you is it frees you from the lies that you've been told. This is why it's called freedom. Is because we're free from the lies, we're free from the defilements, we're free from all of the problems of the world, because we recognize that all of those problems of the world, we made those up. There really are no problems. There's a silly little way of looking at it, is that if you've got a problem that you can't solve, it's not a problem. It's something to be set aside because you can't solve it. But if you can solve the problem, then it's solved. Now it's not a problem. There never was a problem in the first place. That's a lie that we tell ourselves in Western language. The truth is, in Dhamma language, there are no problems. All we have is stuff that we made up. And that making up is called perception. We perceive the problem and we also perceive problems. The problems weren't there in the first place. In fact, Jonas, when you're saying that you get distracted, basically what you're saying is, I don't like my own thoughts. Is that not the case?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. It's like labeled as something to get out of. That's why I labeled it as distraction, I guess. That makes more sense, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So now we're beginning to think in Dhamma language, it's not something to get out of, it's something that I just got out of. Wow, I'm glad I'm not there now. You fix it when you see it, rather than see it, hold it, and hope someday that Dhammarato will give you some plan to get rid of it eventually, rather than doing it right now. That's the difference between ordinary language and Dhamma language. It's, "Oh, I've got a problem. I've got to find a solution for the problem later." rather than doing something about it right now. And this is part of the problem of people thinking that the teachings of the Buddha is all about going off to a retreat or going to some meditation hall or whatever like that and postponing the problems that we're creating right now till later when we get into the meditation hall. And then we're in the meditation hall, we still have the problem, and we'll say, oh, 'But if I go deep into meditation enough, then later this problem won't come up.' Which is the wrong way of saying it. The first off is not a problem at all. It's just that whatever came up, you don't like it. And now you have an opportunity right then and there to change it. You can change that thought. All we have to do is to follow the Eightfold Noble Path, to remember, to look. Obviously, Jonas, at that moment you were remembering and you looked and you didn't like it, but you didn't take the third step of making the change right then and there. And sometimes we don't see it at all. And when we don't see it and don't see it and don't see it, that's when it's good to have a noble friend who can come by and give us a quick, uh, kick in the butt to help us wake up. Well, I mean, I was like— go ahead.

**Speaker C:** I thought, I thought like, okay, making a change means I have to get out of the distraction. And actually not seeing that the thought of it's a distraction is already the unwholesome, not seeing that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And more so, not seeing that it's number one, just a thought, and number two, you don't like it. So we're not looking at the feelings. That a thought is just a thought. What makes it unwholesome is that it leads to— when it contacts us, it leads us into feelings, and it leads us into feelings ignorantly. So the ignorance is there in the sense that you weren't even aware that you didn't like the thought. You called it a distracting thought. You blamed the thought when in fact you could have merely changed it right then and there. Or better still, it's not the thought at all, it's the feeling about the thought, and that's what needs to be changed. That we can change our feelings. Now, a lot of people have been trained throughout your life for somehow or another, even though your feelings are your feelings, We identify with those feelings as if those feelings were me, my feelings, but they're not trained that the feelings are very temporary. They're made up and can be changed right here, right now, so that you can train the mind to feel the way you want to feel. You can train the mind to feel the way you want to feel. So Jonas, if you could feel the way you wanted to feel, how would you feel?

**Speaker C:** Well, I guess just good enough.

**Speaker A:** Good enough. Okay, so why, when you had that thing that you're calling a distracted thought, why couldn't you have felt good enough right then and there?

**Speaker C:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Because you didn't remember to look.

**Speaker C:** Because I didn't remember.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you didn't remember to look. You didn't remember that you have an opportunity to change right here, right now. So a lot of it has to do then with training. And this is the ultimate point about the teaching of the Buddha, is that it is a training, it is a skill development exercise. And when you come out of that dissatisfaction, when you come out immediately from that dissatisfaction, right then and there you're free from it. This is an important quality. Then enlightenment is in this actual breath. A lot of people, in fact, think of it as a gradual path. That you've got to work really, really hard for a long time. But the Buddha teaches that his Dharma is good in the beginning, it's good in the middle, and it's good in the end when it's practiced correctly. So what this means then is, is that if you are practicing correctly, when you find a thought that you're calling distraction If you would instead change that to the Dhamma language, I'm going to distract that thought right now, and I'm feeling good about it. So we can change our feelings, change our thought patterns immediately, and gain the benefit of that immediately, as well as over time we gain the skill of being able to see things more clearly. We gain the skill of remembering more often, and we gain the best skill of all, is that the right noble effort actually becomes quite easy. And when it gets easy, it's like, aha, I saw that distracting thought, and aha, because I can see it and I just said it like that, aha, I feel good right now. Even though I just had an unwholesome thought. Aha, I see that unwholesome thought. This is a way of nurturing oneself. But the standard way of doing it is you see that unwholesome thought and you'll say, oh, how can I get rid of unwholesome thoughts? How can I distract? I mean, I'm so distracted. Oh, poor me. And in fact, what you become is you become critical. You're critical of, oh, I should not have those unwholesome thoughts. Oh, I'm a bad boy. Oh, I'll never get out of this. Oh, poor me. When in fact the right way to do it is right then and there, I see that. And so when we practice, aha, I see that, that's the actual practice that makes that change right then and there. Ivan, did you have your finger up?

**Speaker D:** No, I think I just raised it to scratch something.

**Speaker A:** All right. So Catherine, what do you think?

**Speaker E:** So some of what you were saying reminds me of an analogy of looking at a window and just looking at your own reflection and the noise and the busyness behind, and you're just seeing you. But then somebody says to you, Oh, look deeper. You can look through the window. You can see more. And it's actually not that hard. You just shift your perception so that instead of just looking at yourself all the time, you look at something like new and profound and wonderful and joyful. And you just have to remember to just make that shift and stop staring at yourself.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, the self gets in the way. Of seeing clearly. That's a good expression. I like that. Looking through a window and all we see is our own reflection. But when we change that perception, and that's basically a major point of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, is that we have a choice about how we perceive things. So that's very good. Christina, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** I love the window analogy. Oh, I said I.

**Speaker F:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So attention's a funny thing. Because when, like, one becomes hyper-focused and the attention is pointed so acutely on a thing, that's when a distraction is disruptive in the body. It doesn't feel good. And so in reality, your attention is so pointed that you're not aware of anything around you. And I was explaining this to Arahant, and he had mentioned, he told a story secondhand about you, Dhammarato. And I'm curious if you remember, if you could share where you were practicing and intently focusing and someone, one of the teachers was walking around you to get your attention or something like this and kind of said something. I don't know if I'm if you recall the story.

**Speaker A:** Yes, actually. Have you ever heard of the term Zen stick?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that story that you're telling fits in with that, that the Zen master will carry a little bamboo stick and that is designed, is cut right down through the middle up into the handle, and then carefully having the boundaries cut out at the junctions so that when the stick is hit, the clap will make a loud sound. Rather than him having to hit the student hard, he just claps it with that stick and it makes a clapping sound. And that— here's the question then, Christina. Who does the Zen master hit with the stick? Jonas would say it's the one who's distracted. And the reality is, is that when the Zen master is walking around the hall, whatever the students are doing, they should become distracted by the reality that the Zen master is there. And in fact, they don't become distracted. They're already in their distraction. And so the Zen master can see if you have somebody coming up behind you and you know that they're behind you, you're going to change your posture a little bit. You're going to give it away. And so the Zen master knows when people are paying attention. He knows when somebody knows that he's there or not. Now, this is something that we're talking about in the sense of becoming aware, becoming aware of the body in the surroundings, becoming aware of the body and the body's reaction to your immediate environment. This is what we can call, in fact, at-onement or atonement. We call it be here now. We can call it unification. To where you're there. Um, what is it? Uh, you, you, you, uh, unity or, uh, Anicca. All right, duality is when you're not there, that the mind is someplace else rather than being in the here now. So if you are here in the present moment, that means that all 6 senses are in operation. All 6 senses are in operation. The mind door, the eye door, the ear door, the feeling door, the body door— all your doors are open. And then you're in the here now so that you are awake. And I do not understand why so many Western practitioners want to go deep, because deep means shutting down. Now, in the time of the Buddha, they had various meditations before the Buddha. He actually practiced them before he woke up with the point of the mind becoming one-pointed or focused. This is also the quality of going deep or taking an object. Well, if you're taking a meditation object and you're absorbed with that object, what's the Zen master going to do when he sees you doing that? He's going to whack you with that Zen stick and wake you up. Well, isn't that kind of the job of our Dharma group, is to help our friends wake up? Bringing a little bit of a Zen stick in there, and when somebody posts a bunch of garbage, we can respond to that garbage as if we've just whacked a piece of garbage. This is in fact one of the questions that was being asked, is like Jhana's, he was aware, he remembered to look and he saw, but he didn't do anything about it. What about the students who are not remembering, not looking, don't see the Dukkha, print something on, post something on Discord that's totally off the wall, isn't it our responsibility to point that out? Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's very common, especially because people are very used to this notion of, oh, you have to validate how I feel, you have to buy into my story. You have to meet me halfway. And when it's being pointed out that it's just full of Dukkha, people don't like that. People get really offended.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe then there's a difference between ordinary culture versus Dhamma culture. Ordinary language means you're not supposed to wake up. You're supposed to see the the lies and live it. And if somebody comes along with a piece of truth, you don't like it. You don't want to know the truth. You want to know how to stay in that ordinary mind state. Because waking up takes a bit of effort in the beginning. Eventually it becomes the habit. Eventually, we become so used to looking at what's going on, we stay distracted by the here-now all the time. To stay awake, to stay alert, to stay in the present moment, as opposed to going off into being absorbed with something, being concentrated by something, including having the same thought over and over again, like I got to go to the bank, I got to get my papers together, I don't like that particular clerk, I'm going to wait until I have the clerk that I want, etc., like that. I don't like the chairs at the bank. And you can have all kinds of thoughts about the bank, And hopefully you've got a Zen master behind you who's going to come, "Wake up, you're not at the bank. You're not at the bank. Why are you thinking about the bank? If you're at the bank, think about the bank, and if you're not at the bank, don't think about the bank." This is the way that we practice, and it has to do with every moment. Meditation is not something that you do in a meditation hall. This is part of the reason why I don't use the word meditation. We'll give meditation to those who practice meditation, and we'll call this practice noble waking up practice. It doesn't take a particular posture. It takes a particular mind state. And so this is the way that we practice over and over and over again. Pimo, what do you think? It's a joy to be here listening.

**Speaker D:** To the talk and seeing everybody.

**Speaker A:** So Khalid, what do you have to say? Thank you for the reminder.

**Speaker G:** And yeah, that was great.

**Speaker A:** Amrit, what do you have to say?

**Speaker H:** Thanks, Dhammarato. It's a great talk and very happy to hear. And also, it's a very easy practice. Just wake up now. And remove the unwholesome thought. But I have a question. I was listening to Your talk in the US with the US Sangha. I think it was last week or last, last week, I do not remember. But there You actually equate Mara and self. So, can You a little bit elaborate on this? So you said Mara is same as self or self is same as Mara.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that in fact when Mara comes, who is the Mara?

**Speaker H:** So I think it's like old bad habits.

**Speaker A:** Right. But whose bad habits?

**Speaker H:** They feel like me. They feel like a self.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. And that we can also have the perception of and see it is that, oh, this is not me, this is just a habit that is in the mind. And the mind is not my mind, it's just a mind. But in fact, you could say that when we are selfish, that's when we don't know It's hard to see the self when we're actually in the self. And so this is why it requires— like, for instance, when Jonas was talking about being distracted, who is it, Jonas, that's distracted?

**Speaker C:** Oh, it's the me that I'm telling myself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's the me right there. It's the me that doesn't like it. And so you could make one step further away from that. Rather than saying that it's me, you can say, though, it's Mara. It's not me. Aha, I see you, Mara. Which is basically then an analogy for this is merely an unwholesome thought in the mind. It's not me, it's not mine. But we're not used to looking for the me in there. Which by the way, I really like that issue of watching the picture. You think you're looking out the mirror, out the window, but in fact all we're doing is looking at our own reflection, and we don't even know it. And so that's the way to recognize it, is by changing the language from me, I don't like it, into aha, I see you, Mara. So, B, what do you have to say?

**Speaker F:** I really like it. I think that it gives me the image of like kind of expansion versus constriction. And so the expansion is when you can actually really see everything and the clarity around it and kind of like this merging that occurs as opposed to the constriction when you're kind of resisting and whatnot. So I appreciate it. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And so ordinary language, we want to focus in on something, but with Nama language, we want to open, to expand, to be present in the present moment. So that we can see everything that's happening, including the body. The body, all the only job that you have for the body, by the way, is to allow it to be at rest, to be comfortable. That if you are, let us say, sick, and you're saying, "Oh, poor me, I'm so sick," The better way to say it is, "Hey, the body is okay right now. It'll be all right. No problem here. Not a worry in the world. And meanwhile, I can take the afternoon off." Everything is actually all right. So Paul, What do you have to say?

**Speaker I:** Thank you for the talk. Good reminder to pay attention to the usage of I, me, mine within speech and within discursive thoughts as well. Better keep track of all that. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the discursive thought often is self-referential.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** We're not aware of it. And so practicing by making sure that the I, me, and my doesn't make it out onto the paper or onto the Discord or onto the internet, and then the I, me, my doesn't make it out of the mouth, and fairly soon you'll gain the skill of the I, me, my doesn't make it into the mind, that when it comes into mind, "Aha, I see that. I see that selfishness. I see that attachment. I see that unhappy feeling that comes with not liking." So Robert Q, what do you think? Thank you, Dhammarato, for the talk and especially for the practice of looking out for I, me, mine. I think I like that practice. Thank you. It's a good practice. It's a fun practice. I see that I, capital letter. So practice that. Practice being happy catching it, as opposed to being critical of oneself. Remember that this is a game. So Robert, what do you think? Thanks for the reminder to practice. Yes, it's good to practice. And not get caught up in the stories. Because the stories are almost always self-referential. They're my stories about me. So don't get caught up in the stories. Be able to see them. And so practicing not writing the 'I,' practicing not saying the 'I,' will help develop the skill to remember to see the 'I' when it comes up in the mind. So, Bhavana, what do you have to say?

**Speaker H:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker J:** It's Anicca, Arhat, Anagami, that's a nice reminder. So simple and easy to slide away from the act of being right now. But actually, a quick question. What about situations when a person is on a plane of planning something for future and considering some plans? Thought precedes action. Eventually needs to be done? Is it just about being focused on the job that is being done right now?

**Speaker A:** Well, if you can figure something out right then and there, you figured it out. So you know, and there's no reason to continue to figure and to figure. You By the way, planning has a very interesting quality to it. Nothing, nothing ever goes to plan. This is always why there are Plan Bs, is because the plans don't work. In fact, not only does Plan A not work, Plan B doesn't work. Reality is far too complicated, and when the moment arrives, It's not going to be the way that you thought it was going to be. It's going to be different. And so, planning doesn't gain much value. So one of the things then that you can do is you can be on guard for planning. It's okay to do a little planning, but let's not get wrapped up into it. Let's not make it an object. So when you see the planning, you can come right out, oh, that's just planning. I already know the way to the bank. Why do I have to think about getting there 25 different times? So in fact, life doesn't require much planning. But in fact, a lot of planning is going to wind up being a lot of disappointment because things don't go according to plan. It's better to just live in the present moment happily. So when they say be prepared, they're not saying make a lot of plans. Being prepared means be here now. So, Yanis, what do you have to say? Can you— okay. Thank you for the call. Yeah, I enjoyed this talk about destruction. All right, so does anybody have any last things to say? All right, Mikey.

**Speaker G:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Sheep.

**Speaker G:** No, no, I just want to say thank you for reminding me, because I.

**Speaker A:** Remember— well, I forget a lot.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Mikey, why don't you take this away?

**Speaker A:** Oh, Kirschny, I left you out. Do you have something to say before we finish?

**Speaker I:** My friends have something to say, actually. So the guest asks, are we Buddhists?

**Speaker A:** The joke is not just no, but hell no. Buddhism, term with Buddhist teaching teaching, that has been usurped by a lot of ordinary people and turned into a religion. And so the way that we would express that is that we are Dhamma friends who are in the Buddha's Dhamma, that we practice according to what the Buddha taught, not according to what Buddhism has wound up being. Because Buddhism itself is a huge topic that's got all kinds of features and strange stuff, mostly not liberating, that we stay only with the liberating Dhamma.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So we're not Buddhist. Right.

**Speaker I:** And another friend, Nuki, her computer froze, but she asked me a question that I should relay to you, or a message. It sounds like good advice to say, now is not the time to think about this, as opposed as opposed to "this is a distraction." It is important to remember that one's thoughts come unbidden and affect no one but oneself. Therefore, there is no reason to feel bad about or even responsible for them, no matter what they are. Be positive and stay forgiving, especially with yourself.

**Speaker A:** She's back. There's a lot of different language that is used in that. One of the stronger words would be abandon. To abandon that thought. Another one would be to let it go. But a softer way of saying it is just set it aside. Just set it aside. Now is not the time is an okay way to start with, so I'll set it aside, or it'll be set aside. This is not worth thinking about. Now, generally, what— when we're talking about it's not the time for it, what that really means is, is probably not much of any time for it, especially in the future, because when the future comes, it'll be the now. And maybe then, or maybe not, will be the time for it. But the question is much more of the, uh, can we see what the mind is doing right now so that we can change it to something more wholesome right now? So setting aside, abandon the thought, put it down, say, uh, maybe later, all of those kinds of things are ways of making a change right here, right now. Just another way of saying, uh, setting it aside. Does that make sense?

**Speaker I:** That's for me.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Mikey, I'll let you take it from here, and I'll go lay me down. And so everybody can stay on. I would really appreciate it if you'd stay, make friends, talk about what we've been talking about. This is really a Sangha to be made friends with. So that we get to know each other. And I'm especially pleased to see, uh, B and, uh, Christina and Catherine here today. Make friends with each other. We've got actually a ladies section on the, uh, Discord group for, uh, you to, uh, uh, cackle together. So bye-bye, folks. Thank you all for coming. Hope to see you soon. Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a group of Sangha friends, centers on the distinction between **ordinary language** and **Dhamma language**, a teaching from Ajahn Buddhadasa. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Concept: Two Languages**
*   **Ordinary Language:** Described as a **"balloon"**—playful, temporary, fragile, and focused on the self ("I," "me," "mine"). It reinforces a conventional, often deluded, view of reality where problems and a solid self seem real.
*   **Dhamma Language:** Described as a **"knife"**—used to cut through illusion, diagnose truth, and see reality as it is. It is direct, liberating, and points to non-self.

### **Key Shifts in Perspective**
1.  **From "Going Deep" to "Cutting Through":**
    *   Ordinary language talks of meditation as "going deep" into the mind or forest (an endless, abstract pursuit).
    *   Dhamma language sees practice as **cutting through** delusion right here and now, like slicing a loaf of bread. Enlightenment is available in the present moment, not in a distant future state.

2.  **From "Distraction" to "Derailing":**
    *   In ordinary view, a "distraction" pulls you off your assumed "track" of wholesome practice.
    *   In Dhamma view, the ordinary, self-centered train of thought *is* the problematic track leading to *dukkha* (suffering). Therefore, the goal is to **"derail" or "distract" the mind *from* that unwholesome track** and into a wholesome, present-moment awareness.

3.  **From Self-Centric to Impersonal Language:**
    *   A major practical exercise is to **eliminate "I," "me," and "mine"** from speech and writing. Instead of "I am tired," say "There is tiredness." This linguistic shift trains the mind to see experiences as impersonal phenomena, weakening identification with them.

4.  **From "Problem-Solving" to "Seeing Clearly":**
    *   Ordinary language creates "problems." Dhamma language reveals that what we call problems are often mental fabrications (*sankhara*). When seen clearly, they can be set aside or abandoned in the moment. "There never was a problem in the first place."

### **Practical Application**
*   **Practice is Dynamic & Immediate:** It is not about passive, deep absorption. It is the **"noble waking up practice"** of remembering to look at the present mind-state and changing unwholesome thoughts/feelings *immediately*.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment:** When you notice an unwholesome thought, celebrate with an **"Aha, I see that!"** This is the act of waking up. Replace self-criticism ("I'm distracted") with this joyful recognition and then gently change the thought or feeling.
*   **Role of the Sangha (Noble Friends):** The group acts like a **"Zen stick,"** kindly pointing out when someone's speech or thinking is mired in ordinary, self-centered language, helping each other wake up.
*   **Mara as the Self:** The hindrances or "bad habits" of mind (*Mara*) are equated with the sense of self. Saying **"Aha, I see you, Mara!"** is a skillful way to depersonalize and abandon unwholesome states.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that the Dhamma is a **training in clear seeing and immediate freedom**. By shifting from the inflating, problem-creating "balloon language" of the self to the cutting, liberating "knife language" of reality, practitioners can find peace and awakening right in the midst of daily life, without needing to "go deep" or wait for a future solution. The ultimate goal is to stay "distracted" by the wholesome reality of the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several core metaphors and illustrative stories to explain the difference between "ordinary language" and "Dhamma language."

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Balloon vs. Knife:** This is the central metaphor introduced from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.
    *   **Ordinary Language (Balloon):** Is a "plaything"—attractive, temporary, and subject to "popping," which leads to disappointment. It represents the superficial, conventional way of speaking that is tied to a sense of self.
    *   **Dhamma Language (Knife):** Is used to "cut things open" and diagnose. It represents the truthful, penetrating language of reality that cuts through illusion and frees one from suffering.

2.  **Going "Deep" vs. Cutting "Through":**
    *   **Ordinary View:** Meditation or understanding is seen as going **deep** (like into a forest or into the mind), which implies an endless, gradual journey.
    *   **Dhamma View:** Understanding is about cutting **through** illusion directly and immediately, like a knife slicing through a loaf of bread. The "halfway into the forest" story illustrates that you can't go infinitely "deep"; true understanding is a complete penetration, not a long descent.

3.  **Railroad Track:**
    *   **Ordinary Mind:** Is like being on a fixed railroad track of habitual, self-centered thinking that leads to suffering (*Dukkha*).
    *   **Dhamma Practice:** The goal is to **derail** or be **distracted from** that unwholesome track. Here, "distraction" is re-framed as a positive act—derailing the mind from its unhealthy habitual paths.

4.  **Window Reflection (contributed by a participant, Catherine):**
    *   **Ordinary Perception:** Is like staring at a window and only seeing your own reflection (the self).
    *   **Dhamma Perception:** Involves a shift in attention to **look through the window** at the reality beyond the self, which is described as "new and profound and wonderful and joyful."

5.  **Expansion vs. Constriction:**
    *   **Dhamma (Expansion):** Being present and aware with all senses open, leading to clarity and a sense of merging with the present moment.
    *   **Ordinary (Constriction):** Resisting the present, focusing narrowly, and being trapped in self-referential stories.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **The "Baby Shower" Game:** The speaker uses this game (where you lose if you say the word "baby") as a playful model for a mindfulness exercise. He suggests practicing by removing "I," "me," and "mine" from your speech and writing to weaken self-centered thinking and become more mindful.

2.  **The Zen Stick Story:** This story, referenced by Christina, involves a Zen master walking around a meditation hall with a stick that makes a loud clap. The master isn't hitting the "distracted" student in the ordinary sense. Instead, he is "waking up" the student who is absorbed in a meditation object (going "deep") and has shut out awareness of the present moment. The story underscores that true practice is about being awake and aware in the "here and now," not absorbed in a trance.

3.  **Gloria Steinem's Quip:** Referencing (or misattributing) a quote, the speaker says, "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, but first it's going to really piss you off." This story highlights that Dhamma language—the truth—can be initially uncomfortable because it challenges the lies and comfortable illusions of ordinary life.

4.  **Mara as the Self:** In the Q&A, the speaker equates the mythical tempter **Mara** with the arising sense of **self**. The story or practice implied is to personify unwholesome thoughts not as "my" failures, but as "Mara" visiting. This allows one to say, "Aha, I see you, Mara," creating a helpful detachment from selfish habits.

5.  **The Bank Planning Example:** Throughout the talk, the speaker uses the recurring, anxious thought pattern about going to the bank (worrying about clerks, chairs, etc.) as a mundane example of the "railroad track" of ordinary, self-referential thinking that one needs to "derail."

### **Summary of Key Contrasts**
| **Metaphor/Concept** | **Ordinary Language / Mind** | **Dhamma Language / Mind** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Tool** | Balloon (temporary, fragile) | Knife (cutting, discerning) |
| **Goal of Practice** | Go **deep** (endless journey) | Cut **through** (immediate penetration) |
| **State of Mind** | On a fixed **railroad track** of habit | **Derailed** from unwholesome tracks |
| **"Distraction" is...** | A problem, pulling you from your goal | The **solution**, pulling you from suffering |
| **Perception** | Seeing only your **reflection** (self) | Looking **through the window** (reality) |
| **Awareness** | **Constricted**, focused on self/story | **Expanded**, open to the present moment |
| **Identity** | "I am tired/frustrated" (self exists) | "There is tiredness/frustration" (no self) |

These metaphors and stories work together to paint a picture of Dhamma practice as an immediate, present-moment activity of waking up, using truthful language, and breaking free from the constricting stories of the self.
