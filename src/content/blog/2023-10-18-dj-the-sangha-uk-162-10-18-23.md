### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Turn my camera on in a bit.

**Speaker B:** Hello everyone.

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** Starting up the Wednesday Sangha call. It's the 18th. I wasn't sure who was going to intro, so I just popped in. If this does get uploaded, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So, but yeah, we're just talking a little bit about getting out into nature. To practice on Anapanasati and investigating Dharma. So I don't know if you wanted to share again, Pañña, a bit more about your experience.

**Speaker A:** So basically today I was blessed, had the opportunity to spend some time in nature, take a small hike from my house into the woods. And, you know, after 10 to 15 to 20 minutes hike, there are plenty of spots where one can sit and meditate. Like, I really enjoy places where there are like trees and bushes that I feel pretty much surrounded by vegetation, you know, like by not just trees, but also like, how to say, tall bushes, so that I feel also like, I feel that my head touches some Anagami, you know. Pretty much surrounded the target by vegetation, and it's pretty cool. I like that setting. And yeah, so basically I felt pretty lucky, you know, having the opportunity to be in nature and also like in feeling the aliveness of the woods, of the forest, this alive stillness of the forest. And like, I found myself also like very open to a sort of inquiry about my relationship with nature, you know.

**Speaker D:** Because.

**Speaker A:** I think about all the time about what does it mean to be in a state of almost true nature, true nature for my own mind, but also like the nature itself. It's a very close concept to this true nature of oneself, because when I when we are out in the nature, it's like, it's, you know, it's untouched, unconditioned, still. And so it really, it is really, really near, if not it is actually the representation of true nature of oneself. And so like Spending time in the nature and also catching with the rhythm of the forest, of the wood, I like become open almost with this relaxed view. If one has the eyes open, that is really taking in everything, you know. And so it's really a sort of training one can go through when there are birds and sounds and bugs, flies and so on. And so like, it was a training for me, try to see how much my attention could be indiscriminate. Like, there is a side that reacts and like labels and so on, and a side that is more nature-prone. That like just registers what's happening. Like it's not really reactive, but still there is a sense of connectedness with what is going on. It's not like a non-reaction that is not participating, but like it follows the rhythm of the nature, of the environment it's in. And so I also like asked to myself, like, after, you know, being born in a society, you know, I spent some time in the nature myself when I was little and growing up and so on. But like also my mindset with the nature has changed a lot. And so I was asking, like, is it possible to, like, am I still connected with nature somehow? Can I reconcile with nature? Am I as human, am I natural still, or am I like a total disconnected thing from this beautiful virgin-like environment that I find myself in? And so like, but this is also while doing Anapanasati and stuff and so on. But in all the 3 sessions I had in the nature, then there came a moment when I said, "Okay, it's cool, you know, I'm satisfied, I can go back home now." Even interacting with people and looking at my, you know, it was really for 1 hour, half an hour, 1 hour each time. And all the time I came back, I was this, I was also looking at my own domestic pets. It was really a different approach, you know, because it was such a full immersion experience. That really changed me a bit each time. It was very intense. And so like I was contemplating how, like, with this remembrance of the experience of the immersion in the nature, I felt like I had tapped a bit into a different kind of knowledge that is more It follows more the rhythm of the nature itself, of the woods itself, of the forest itself. And so it was really kind of a different approach. Even then a lot of things happened, like a lot of different kind of inquiries and thoughts happened in reaction to that thing. But like I promised myself, if I can, if I could like to spend at least half an hour, one hour a day in the nature, like I promise this to myself. Because it's, I find that it has always been, but now like together with Anapanasati breathing, it's like it's becoming like vital to me. To meditate, but in the nature. Like when I'm at home, it's like a total different thing, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is nice. It's very conducive, I find, to practice. Also, welcome, Rick and Alexander.

**Speaker A:** Glad to see you.

**Speaker E:** Hey, DJ, it's been a while.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's been a little bit. Getting the Wednesday calls going again.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, I've been enjoying going kind of like you said, Paitro, for you, you've got like a place that's rather close where you can just kind of go out into, you know, nature, enjoy that. And behind my house there's a little wooded forest and there's a nice little trail there. So I've actually started practicing like walking meditation. So I've been actually getting— even before I go to work, I'll get up and, you know, even go for like a half hour or something and practice the walking meditation, kind of taking the slow steps and becoming aware of the breath and the steps and, you know, working with like wholesome thoughts and playing around and experimenting with that. And it's been really nice. And it is quite conducive. I find it's nice to have both sort of practices where one practices getting out into nature and really experiencing that, and it's still good to, you know, practice that at home or indoors as well in those conditions because sometimes we can't get out. But it is nice when we have the opportunity, and it is quite conducive to just appreciate that natural beauty. I see you're out there, Alex. Got a big tree behind you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, I think it's wonderful to see the connection between the instructions, the formal instructions given by the Buddha and our ability to enter seclusion. I think that's a really cool thing to key in on. Like you said, Pietro, when you're in seclusion, your practice of Anapanasati is different from when you're not in seclusion. And I think that's a really nice thing to take notice of, because we're looking to have a refuge that's available to us at all times, that's available to us in any conditions, this refuge. And I think that when we look at how we normally concoct our refuges, you know, compared to how seclusion itself can be a refuge and what remains constant between the two, we get little indicators as to how to better construct those refuges. I think that's a really, really cool thing that you took notice of, Pietro. I really thank you for sharing it with us.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Sorry for the beeping, there's vehicles nearby me. I'm not as secluded as it seems.

**Speaker C:** Something that came up since last Wednesday Piero was talking about independence in our practice, and my mind contemplated that considerably. And I found that where I am in life and with the practice, there's a lot of responsibility to maintain.

**Speaker D:** My.

**Speaker C:** Own base of independent manifestation, like in relationship and when I encounter others. But I found Piero's disclosures highly conducive to happiness. I think when we spoke before, Some of the things that my mind was ruminating about or trying to catch me.

**Speaker B:** With.

**Speaker C:** Was related to ways I had let that go, kind of when my practice wasn't as strong as it could have been. And now that I've returned to strong practice, I do see, you know, there's that aspect that we are in interconnection And we are interconnected to everything, everyone else. At the same time, there is a sense of responsibility and independence that this practice gives us. I think for me, there's a distinction between physical seclusion or seclusion from the world and mental seclusion that we gain in the practice. And I spoke with an ordained monk, friend of Bhante, Bhante Prasasuk, and right away he realized— and we've only spoken probably a handful of times on the telephone, we spoke today, earlier this morning And he realized that sometimes I sell my own confidence short.

**Speaker A:** Yes, like continuing about the nature and the practice in the nature. We talked about seclusion, which like.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker D:** Actually.

**Speaker A:** Underestimated the value of seclusion myself, because sometimes I would just go in a park or even if crowded, a crowded park, or, you know, in a shared house, just in the living room on the sofa. I was like also a bit challenging for myself, like I found it that entertaining to like just try to be still in difficult situation. Like, but then I realized that I didn't have to do that because.

**Speaker D:** There.

**Speaker A:** Is the possibility actually of seclusion, which is a good, really good point. Because, you know, the approach to meditation is the same, but what I get out of it, it's different in the sense that before maybe I practiced meditation because I wanted to be a better man in society. But at the same time, as I developed my practice of meditation, I realized that actually there's not much left that I get can get from the so-called society situation. I mean, you know, I think about many social contexts that I was used to in the last years, and actually people hang out and there always, there'll be some alcohol or some other things and so on. But like, as soon as I start practicing on my own, I saw that I didn't feel the urge anymore to go out and look for certain things. So like, I discovered seclusion at the same time. I like, so the purpose of meditation now is becoming just like spending time in seclusion with no mean to get out and do something and achieve something. Just like meditation for the sake of meditation itself. Because I feel the benefit immediately in terms of oxygenation and relaxing. And like with seclusion, you know, there's like really not— I realized that this kind of fractal way that it's been a while since I don't really entertain conversation, like dialogues in my mind. Between, you know, different figures of my life, you know. But at first it was really easy for me to get into some kind of conversation in my mind, like simulating some kind of future conversation that could happen and so on. And then I stopped entertaining them all bit by bit. But then there is a a whole underworld to it. Like, because our main mind is made of these connections, you know. All of these connections are equal to all the conversations we had and all the patterns we developed. And so actually, one discovers that even spending more time in seclusion, like Now you remove the world outside and there is a whole world that is equally infinite inside of your mind. And so like, but the lucky thing is that this won't drive you crazy because now you know that your object of meditation is the breath all the time. And so you have this anchor. With you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's like, where do I go from here? Now that I have all these sort of insights, you know, it's still the breath, it's still the object of the breath. So like, this is, this could vary, you know, it's solid, it's liquid and so on, but the main thing is that you are anchor it to the breathing. And so like then all the kinds of investigation can go on while you breathe.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's nice for grounding just to keep coming back and waking up to like what is happening now. Because I think too it goes to what you were saying, Brett, too, about like seclusion, you know, both physically, but then there's also the mental seclusion. So we can get out into the woods, there can be no one around, But, you know, due to old memories coming up or whatever, we might catch ourselves in an argument with somebody who's not even there. So by coming back to the breath and being like, oh, wakey wakey, you know, and then just waking up again and again and training that skill, we see that and we're like, oh wait, no, we're in this lovely forest right now, you know. Or even if we're not in the forest, oh, we're just enjoying breathing. Okay, this is nice. Or we can even change the way that, you know, we feel about whomever we're arguing with. You know, may they be happy, may they be well. You know, we can— goodwill. Yeah, goodwill. Yeah, drop the ill will.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and that doesn't mean can they keep walking all over me. That doesn't mean can they keep doing all the evil. It means can they wake up. Yeah, you know, because that's a— that's— that's the big difference a lot of people will look at. Like loving-kindness meditation, Metta meditation, and they'll take it in a really superstitious way. You know, like that's really doing this, that's really doing that. But what we're really wishing is just the same as we wish for all beings, is just the ability to be free, the ability to recognize your birthright, the ability to recognize that when I'm in seclusion, the mind still encounters mental objects, and that still presents in my experience. You know, so then I don't have to be superstitious when I come out of seclusion and be like, oh, I'm having these thoughts because this is happening, and start identifying and taking ownership of all of these naturally occurring phenomena. And I know they're naturally occurring because when I seclude myself in nature, well, they still occur. And so I don't have to make up a big story anymore when I come out of seclusion, mental seclusion, or physical seclusion. We don't have to. It's just doing its own thing anyways, you know, so we don't have to be there in the way that we thought we had to be there. It's such a wonderful relief when you realize the danger, the danger of picking up hot things, picking up things that don't belong to us and walking around with them as if they are ours as if they are us, which is even a more wilder supposition when we go down the train of logic that we get to actually watch in action when we sit in seclusion, you know, is we don't just believe that they're ours, we believe that they are us, you know. So we've placed all these different conditions on our experience now that are saying all these different things when really it's just like this, whatever it is. Which is such a beautiful, beautiful realization. It's a beautiful realization to watch the mind do what the mind does and to recognize it's just the mind watching the mind. There's no need for a self. There's no need for any of the things that we normally stuff a bunch of files and papers into and carry around and make us feel important like a briefcase. And if we don't give a crap about the files anymore, why are we carrying the briefcase still?

**Speaker B:** So yeah.

**Speaker D:** We wake up and we're so wonderful. Sorry, what? Yeah, wake up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no, we just wake up and we realize, oh yeah, why are we carrying this briefcase? And then we can put it back down. The mind might, you know, stumble into delusion again, but then we wake up and we go, okay, cool, drop the briefcase.

**Speaker D:** Very long.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Oh, wonderful.

**Speaker B:** This is nature's briefcase.

**Speaker D:** Get it monogrammed. Nature's bookcase. I like it. Oh man. And it gets even easier too when we come out of seclusion and we find that there are others that are coming out of seclusion, that are waking up, you know. And when we see others that are waking up, seeing things as they are, man, what a good time. Every Wednesday at noon Pacific time, you know, how wonderful. What is it, Saturday at whatever time it was on Saturday that was so wonderful? And that's a great, great thing to recognize is the simplicity of it all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's wonderful to have friends to share with.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, because it really seems to be a big important part of the whole package is to have the friends to share. Yeah, it really is a nice element. Yeah. Oh, it's wonderful. Yeah, I used to have a lot of fears when I was younger about being alone. That was always something I held in my mind, you know, when I had a whole bunch of stuff in it there to hold. It was, I'm gonna be alone, or I was alone, or I am alone, or someone was going to leave me alone, something like that, you know. And it replayed all kinds of weird ways in all kinds of weird situations. And every time I've ever clung to the thought or to the feeling, you know, as it played out, like, oh, this is me, this is mine, I'm alone, this is happening, oh, it never worked out positively. You know, often I found I was getting in my own way. So it's a wonderful thing to realize we can put those things down and to be able to do that in the company of others and understand that, I mean, the whole supposition that kind of pushed it along in the beginning to begin with is the idea that someone can be alone. Like Pietro, you talked earlier about connection, interconnection, and Brett, you talked about responsibility and interconnection. And I think that those things are such wonderful themes to carry forward in the mind. I think they're really noble themes, connection and responsibility, whether that responsibility comes across in the way that we do it, or I know we've talked about before duty to the Dhamma, You know, we talk about the Noble Truths as being duties, you know, recognizing, understanding, suffering, all these sorts of things. So it's such wonderful themes in our conversation today. Thank you all so much.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, man.

**Speaker E:** What a nice reframe, right? You have, oh no, I'm alone, and now you're like, oh boy, I'm alone.

**Speaker D:** Isn't it?

**Speaker E:** The same situation, but different concept that.

**Speaker C:** I could just do concept that I in my own way by considering myself to, or by fabricating the concept that I'm somehow alone, I could be in my way that way.

**Speaker E:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you know, I remarked to Bhante today that, you know, am I too much of a recluse? Do I have a responsibility to get out more? And, you know, he admitted he felt a little bit that way too. But, you know, he's all the time going places doing service. And I told him, I said, you know what, all I'm looking for is just more instruction. You know, yeah, so spending time with him, going out to the— I admitted that just driving out to the Wat was a practice for me. All this, all the ways that Mara tries to arise to convince me not to drive to the Wat. It's about a 45-minute drive from where I live, but it's always worth it.

**Speaker B:** When he's not there, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you know, you've got something better than what he has on offer. It's amazing. And that's a very good point too, when you talk about driving to the Wat being a practice. It's part of practicing being happy, right? Part of seeing the path is seeing what, when I do it, leads to my long-term well-being, you know? What, when I do it, leads to my long-term suffering? And you see past what Mara has on offer, you know, and you see what is available to us right here, right now. That's amazing. And earlier you talked about selling yourself short on confidence too. I think this is part of the reason we have to develop it as a factor, right? It's a factor of awakening. You know, it's one of the supporting factors there. So many amazing lists that the Buddha prescribed for us, you know, and that's certainly a prime contender for top of the list of lists, you know, on the wings of awakening. So that's— yes, yeah, so it's great to share with us how you do it. We get it, and it's amazing to do that all together. Thank you so much for that. Thank you.

**Speaker E:** That'd be a pretty good band name, On the Wings of Awakening.

**Speaker D:** Would it be?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I'd see them.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, me too.

**Speaker E:** I'd see them. I'm gonna go see the Wings of Awakening this Friday.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, their shows are very enlightening.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they got a couple members, you know, uh, Samatha and Vipassana.

**Speaker D:** A lot of great qualities.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I know that those are sometimes brought up, but kind of as like the two sort of wings, right, is the calming and also the clear sight.

**Speaker D:** And they support each other. Yeah, two sticks, you know. We can't really have Samadhi without being able to see, you know, the way things are. It's kind of difficult. As a matter of fact, the harder it becomes to see the way things are, the harder it is to get the mind into a state of collectedness or composure, whatever you'd like to call it. You know, the less clear sight taking place, the less ability to calm down. And they balance each other, you know, which is why we have to train in both, right? Developing and abandoning. So if we can develop the ability to calm, then naturally clear sight can come with that, so long as we remember to look. Without one or the other, they can become unbalanced. We can look about at things a little differently than maybe the path intended for them to come out, I suppose, if we can ascribe intention to it. I guess we can ascribe intention to any element of the path. So that's a big part of what we're doing. Holding an intention to come back to the breath and observing when we wander from it, why that happened.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's nice. I mean, I have real confidence in Anapanasati and like being the complete package.

**Speaker D:** Yes, yes, absolutely. It's amazing when you start to practice. It's beautiful because it builds itself up. You know, we hear about it, we do it, we see it, we talk about it, we keep doing it. And what I notice is the thing that strikes me the most as of late has been this part of it where the Buddha will talk about not even just the tetrads and the 16 steps, all the mechanical portions, but rather just this portion where he talks about it. It is a complete package. And when you do it continuously, it leads to full release, you know, full knowledge and release, clear knowledge. And I think it's amazing to talk about going from seclusion, out of seclusion, into seclusion, going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And when we first pick up the pieces of the path and we start trying to put them together in our own lives, I know for me a lot of times it was, you know, hey, this is when I do this, this is when I do that, you know. I started having all these conditions that I was recognizing just in thinking about whether or not I was going to practice, you know. And after a while, it becomes a little easier to see, like, oh, you just— you're always doing it one way or another, right? You're always breathing one way or another until you're dead. We know that that's about when that stops for this thing. And so, like, why not practice continuously, develop it completely? And when you start to practice it continuously, more and more of the steps start to make sense as far as Oh, there's a reason, he said. Practice— sorry, I have a spider friend. You know, there's a reason we do it continuously, because when I'm sitting there and I'm participating in the first portion, you know, and I'm getting good, and then I walk outside and all of a sudden mental fabrications are, you know, rising and such, and I'm recognizing them and seeing, oh, this is what we do when we practice it continuously. We don't have to really do much of anything different, just have to kind of stop keeping keeping track. Let it come up. And like you were saying, Pietro, it's your anchor, you know what I mean? Anchor is the breath. It's always there for us, right? So, so nearby to the mind. It's such a good, uh, good, good looking glass for the mind and the body, you know, so we can come back and bring them together again and use Samatha and Vipassana in those moments. I would start to think about Vipassana only being one part of any of those steps of Anapanasati, and it's there in all of them. You know, it's all baked into itself, like you talked about fractals. Yeah, yeah, that's how— oh.

**Speaker B:** You can go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker C:** Just smiling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was gonna say the fractal thing really resonates in terms of Anapanasati, because like sometimes it feels like, you know, if we, if we're going into steps and it's like they kind of go around each other.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like you talked about before, them being dance steps. Yeah, pretty, pretty dances. Yeah, that is a really cool way to think about it because it breaks up some of the ways that we normally think about it. When I see that someone has taught something important and they put numbers next to the steps, I automatically think, oh well, you know, this is my conditioning, I should do it 1 through 16, 1 through 16, and if I'm not doing it 1 through 16, I'm having trouble, I don't know how to do it, right? Then when we start to look at it in the way that you're talking about, then we realize, oh yeah, okay, it's music, we can do that, this might be one note, this is how we can play this other note, Maybe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like learning scales and chords and all that. You're like, yeah, and getting it down. I think too, I know you, I think it was last Saturday there, Alex, you were talking though about like, again, it can still be done in sequential order. Like I enjoy practicing like that sometimes too. But what's interesting is even step 1, you know, breathing in long, I know I am breathing in long. And breathing out long. I know I am breathing out long. You know, that can still have, you know, if we're kind of bringing that to mind almost like a mantra, that can have a gladdening element. You know, we're aware of the mind, we're gladdening the mind, we're practicing multiple steps. We can even notice the gaps in.

**Speaker D:** Both.

**Speaker B:** You know, the phrasing of that, and then also the sensations themselves of breath. So there's like actually the last tetrad in there, just practicing.

**Speaker D:** And that right there, DJ, is more than enough to give me the same confidence you talk about. It's a complete package. Yeah. And that's a beautiful realization. It gives me such joy. How nice and easy. Yeah, that's amazing. I love that point. Yeah, because it is all in there, because that's a mental fabrication too. You know, so when we talk about Vedana, Vipassana, when we talk about Citta, Nupassana, Dhamma, Nupassana, all of it is there. And I think it's probably part of the show to recognize that, huh? That's pretty cool. And to share Dhamma with others like we're talking about too. I had a great experience of sharing Dhamma with a friend of mine I hadn't seen in a long time. And, you know, one of the things that he had asked me is just, what's different? You know, why do you act differently? Well, let's talk about it. I love to talk about it, you know. So now we have more people in the local area that'll come together and talk about Dhamma as well. It's wonderful.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that is wonderful.

**Speaker D:** Wow. And now it's all in step 1, you know what I mean? If you really look at it long, you know what I mean? And it just grows just like a tree. Seed has the entire treat in it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, people get curious if you simply say to them— and of course honestly say to them— they ask you how you're doing, and instead of the, the rote answer, 'Oh, I'm fine,' or 'I'm good,' you say, 'Oh, I'm calm and I don't have any stress.' And they go How? How do you not have any stress?

**Speaker B:** Are you some kind of wizard?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I mean, that really wakes people up, just that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And they suddenly— because that's not an expected answer, and it's not like you're bragging, like, I don't have any stress. You're actually saying it in a truthful way, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And then the next thing is, well, how do you accomplish that? I said, well, let me tell you, right?

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker B:** I watch the breath and I'm aware.

**Speaker E:** Of the present moment. And you go, oh, so you're talking about meditation? Indeed I am. It's just a few easy steps right to opening the Dhamma door, even if you, you know, without, you know, pushing them, trying to push anybody through because it's like, wow, that sounds really fantastic. You seem like you're on a vacation when you're not. You're clearly not. So yeah, that's a simple stepway, simple ladder to get them over.

**Speaker D:** And so then what we see then is even in that first step of Anapanasati, it's so incredibly complete. It even carries its own advertising material.

**Speaker E:** That's right. It's seamless and effortless, right?

**Speaker D:** How amazing.

**Speaker C:** That's awesome. That's incredible.

**Speaker D:** Right. Like it propagates all on its own. All it takes is for it to get some roots down. That's so cool.

**Speaker C:** I realized yesterday You know, my wife works in the medical field, and for the longest time, and I think probably about 5 years, I was spanning the spectrum from passive to actively complaining, her eating up all her paid leave on sickness, or my sickness, hers, whatever it was. And then yesterday I just came to the realization I don't care if I— if we don't really ever take a physical vacation again. Because we're always on vacation, we're content. And that is something that I had memorized as a not-so-solidification, and it's, it's not true. That complaint, that point of contention, it doesn't exist anymore.

**Speaker E:** That's good, that's good. You see that, you see the social conditioning that, oh, we should be taking a vacation in this traditional manner, right? And that's just those social expectations playing up and for their own particular reasons, you know, for measurements of success, for measurements of like economics or whatever. And that's really good seeing, that's a really good insight to recognize Wow, you know, it really does come down to a state of mind and perspective. And yeah, you could be on vacation in the very next breath. The very next breath.

**Speaker D:** That's wonderful.

**Speaker E:** Why wait? Why wait until this forever moment of like, oh, Once I X, Y, Z, then I'll be— no, you're never— that never works out. It's never, because the next goal goes in front of you. Oh, but no, but wait until this next thing. No, no, no. Too many future plans and goals to conditions, we'll say future conditions to be perfectly happy when, you know, hey, Hey, there's no need for that. Not at all.

**Speaker C:** Casting concrete around my ankles now and now and now. Yep.

**Speaker E:** And it's free too. Like, I mean, not for nothing, but it's absolutely free. Like, breathing in or breathing out, Anapanasati, that's, uh, it's free.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And like you talked about, Brett, with.

**Speaker E:** A duty.

**Speaker D:** Like when the employer doesn't give you a cell phone but expects you to answer the calls, but you have the cell phone and the calls, they're there for you, they're all paid for, it's all good and taken care of. I like what you were saying about unlinking success economically from safety as well, from a feeling of well-being. Taking that connection apart.

**Speaker E:** Right? Able to disentangle the social conditioning from what is actually necessary. It's, uh, it can be, um, it can take some time, but once you're there, then it's a very, very freeing. It's, oh, you know, that's.

**Speaker D:** Uh It's.

**Speaker E:** Not, that's not actually like a universal truth. That's just a social desire, cultural desire that's been programmed in from an early age. It's like, oh, I can detach from that and let that go finally. And, and, you know, if people are shocked, it's like, well, but I didn't need your validation anyway. Like That's, that's your part of society. Like, you're, you're trying to connect, you know, put me back in that little crab cage. And I'm like, no, man, I'm out. Like, I'm out, you know. You know how they pull each other down, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker E:** You know that whole deal? It's like, oh no, no, no, claws off. I'm on the wings of awakening, brother. Claws off, claws off.

**Speaker D:** It's amazing. That's awesome. That fucks me up. That's a very good way to look at it. I like it a lot.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's been a few years now that I've been able to have a noticeable difference about not chasing after validation at every turn from students or family or strangers or the opposite sex or whatever. You know, wow. It's quite a freeing feeling to not worry about that. Talk about confidence, right? The whole thing about needing confidence or not needing confidence, once you are at a point point where validation from others means about this much, yeah, then, then confidence is not even a question anymore, right?

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker D:** Because you don't need it.

**Speaker E:** You don't need it for anything, right? It's not even needed. You just, you just do the actions necessary, and onlookers can— they can continue to look on, right? Doesn't— it really doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter because their opinions will change anyway. Whether you get their validation in one moment doesn't mean you'll have it in the next. And then what are you running after? More conditioning, more social programming, more culture.

**Speaker D:** Their validation is conditioned. My desire for their validation is conditioned.

**Speaker E:** Precisely.

**Speaker B:** It's just, it's not reliable, it's not satisfactory.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, someone wants to make that comment to me, it's like you're suffering under the impression that I care what you think. I don't. And not to be rude, but I don't.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, mostly because we stop also you know, talking about it, you know, like, at least for me, I grew up that was an eternal conversation with peers and so on, like, oh, this thing happened to me, what do you think about it? Also, if you know, it wasn't explicit, like they asked for knowing their opinion, like, oh, this happened to me, what do you think about it? Or this, I'm thinking this, what what do you think about it? But also the answer is do not talk about it, but because there's nothing much left to talk about it, you know, because when I'm alone, I am enjoying the silence. Like, experience is just what is, you know, it's right here, right now, in the silence of nothing really happening. So like When I'm with myself, I'm sharing this happiness, this silent happiness and enjoy right here, right now. So like, "How are you?".

**Speaker D:** "Oh, good.".

**Speaker A:** "What have you been up to?" "Oh, nothing really much, just happy here and now.".

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** Right, and to people who don't know, that sounds very boring and monotonous.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker E:** But that's because they don't understand how enjoyable it really is, right? They don't understand it. But that's okay, because then when I say, "But I don't have any stress," then they get interested. Like, "Oh, okay, how is that?" Promise you won't be bored? I don't care if you're bored. I don't care if you're bored. It doesn't matter to me if you're bored with it or not.

**Speaker B:** It's not my problem.

**Speaker E:** It really isn't. Either way, I'll tell you, you can listen or not. You know, I'll try. I'll certainly try, you know, right? It's part of my— what you want to call— what you call a duty or responsibility to give them, you know, to show them the door. But hey, we all have to walk through. We all have to walk through on our own, you know, with our own steps, with our own will.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, right. It doesn't work any other way.

**Speaker E:** No, no, no.

**Speaker D:** Right? Yeah, that's one of the most wonderful things about coming from that position of being okay, being calm, is when someone approaches and they talk and they want to know why this, why that, you could tell them because it won't bother you one way or another. They can spit it out, they can call you a heretic, they could say whatever silly things they want to say, but it's beyond that level of concocting at that point, you know. And so when we start to use it for validation, whether the teachings or we use it— and I mean, when I talk about validation, I think we can go so far as to extend that to, you know, taking in money in exchange for debiting out or levying out things like this in a way that is, uh, business-like, I guess, whatever you want to say. Um, when we start using it in that way, even those can cause us to suffer because then we have an attachment. Oh, this doesn't work, and you're a shitty teacher, and I hate it. I'll never send anybody your way, and you're probably lying about this, that, and everything else. And if we're attached to all of that that comes along with it, we have our own reactivity to deal with. But we approach it from the point of view of the practice, approach it from sharing the Dharma. It's just what it is. When they reject it, it's just another thing that is. Just what it is. Comes and it goes. And hopefully it's a seed that'll bloom later, you know, when other causes and conditions are sufficient. That's my thinking, is, you know, we'll put it in the pocket wrapped in— wrapped in, uh, what did you use to sprout seeds in elementary school? You wrap them in toilet paper or something? A little like bean seeds, you know, and hope that their pants will get rained on later, you know. So then this seed will come up. Maybe they won't even remember who gave it to them, but maybe it'll still come up for it.

**Speaker E:** You know, Dhammarato used to call them Dharma bombs. They'd go up, but they're— but they're— but they go off later. Yeah, I remember, I remember, you know, like during live, live meditation retreats, you know, he would call them, if you don't get it now, don't worry don't worry, it'll go off later. It's a— it's a— I said a Dharma bomb. I was like, all right.

**Speaker D:** That'S amazing. Clear it all out. Wow.

**Speaker E:** Well, DJ, I like this format, this passing it back and forth format. Yeah. Despite the whole trying to shy away from liking and disliking, I'll be honest. My ego enjoys this passing the ball around in a circle or a shape instead of— yeah, so that's wholesome. That feels wholesome to me without anyone claiming advancement other than just to share. So yeah, that's nice. I'll definitely be back. To the chat group on a more regular basis. Yeah, I was, I was, uh, I was MIA for a while, but yeah, I like— I really enjoyed this type of easy, chilled-out format without any major structure. So it's very good. It allows things to arise organically.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, glad you enjoyed. Yeah, we kind of like— I think before we normally throw on the recorder, like Petro and I, or Brett, or whoever's on, right? Kind of come up with a little bit of a topic, like, you know, but then it's just like a free-form conversation that happens from that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I, yeah, I recall that was more the format a couple of years ago, and I really, I really personally benefit the most from that kind of thing. So, so yeah, I'll be, I'll be back. But as far as it goes, guys, it was nice to chitchat with with you, and I wish you lots of peace and joy, and probably we'll see you next week.

**Speaker D:** Good.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Rick.

**Speaker D:** Take care, everybody.

**Speaker E:** Bye.

**Speaker D:** I didn't realize we were recording.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, we were.

**Speaker D:** I'm actually very happy that that went that way and that he pointed that out. Because that's really cool. I think that it's also a really cool part of the practice is we have to learn how to talk about this stuff. Otherwise, when the opportunity presents to drop Dhamma bombs, we don't get to, you know, we don't get to share that. So that's really cool. And I also think it goes back to what we talk about when we talk about real Dharma teachings being true and from, you know, this moment, you know what I mean? So that was really nice. I really liked that. Point that out. That was really cool to hear.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I know, it is nice. I, again, I appreciate, you know, these kind of getting rolling. Again, I don't know if I'm always available for them because it is after work and sometimes I have to stay a little bit later, but it's like, hey, just hopping on, it's nice. And I think that, you know, it's nice that it's recorded. The ones on Skype, we're kind of doing the recordings for those, and, you know, maybe some Dhamma bombs I think were dropped today, so that's kind kind of nice.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's cool.

**Speaker B:** But I think it's a very similar format though to like kind of how we were, well, on the Saturday Sangha calls, you know, that I'm doing on Discord, like just kind of open discussion, you know. Some people might feel a little bit more like talking. Sometimes people would just feel a bit more like listening. Like it's okay. It's just sort of like again, an organic conversation, right? You know, yeah, very cool.

**Speaker D:** Pick my stuff up. I'm gonna— I'm supposed to have a refrigerator repairman come around. Around yet?

**Speaker B:** But I actually think I might head out. It's been a wonderful conversation, and I really do, you know, appreciate everybody showing up. And again, I mean, I think it's like, feel free to stay in the Skype for as long as you feel like, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know if it'll— I.

**Speaker C:** Didn'T know it'd been an hour.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's been about an hour. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I thought it had been like 5 minutes, 10 minutes.

**Speaker A:** We can, we can finish the call here if you, everybody agrees. Like, for me it's fine. It's been an hour, and so like, thank you everybody for being here in the call, and thank you, DJ, for starting the call.

**Speaker D:** It was— DJ, thank you so much, and thank you so much, Sangha. I will talk to you guys again soon. You guys are wonderful. Have a great time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, guys.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, my friends.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, DJ.

**Speaker B:** Bye, friends.

**Speaker D:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and insights shared by the Sangha:

**Core Theme: The Conducive Nature of Seclusion and Anapanasati**
The conversation centered on how practicing mindfulness of breathing (Anapanasati) in natural, secluded settings deepens meditation and provides unique insights.

**Main Points Discussed:**

1.  **Nature as a Mirror for "True Nature":** Speaker A (Pietro) described how immersion in the "alive stillness" of the forest felt like connecting with an "untouched, unconditioned" state that mirrors the mind's true nature. This environment facilitated a more open, receptive, and less reactive awareness.

2.  **Physical vs. Mental Seclusion:** The group distinguished between physical seclusion (being alone in nature) and the mental seclusion cultivated through practice. They noted that true refuge is found in the mental seclusion that can be accessed anywhere, though nature powerfully supports its development.

3.  **Anapanasati as a Complete "Anchor":** The breath was emphasized as a constant, reliable anchor for the mind. Through continuous practice, Anapanasati is seen as a complete path—it calms the mind (samatha) and provides clear insight (vipassana) simultaneously. The 16 steps are not always linear but can be like a fractal or a dance, with each step containing the whole.

4.  **Independence and Interconnection:** Practitioners discussed the sense of personal responsibility and independence that comes with a strong practice, while also recognizing deep interconnection with all things. This independence frees one from seeking validation from society or being trapped by social conditioning (e.g., the *need* for vacations, economic success, or others' opinions).

5.  **Sharing the Dhamma Naturally:** The group discussed how living with less stress and more calm naturally sparks curiosity in others. They explored sharing the Dhamma simply and honestly—like planting "Dhamma bombs"—without attachment to whether it is accepted or rejected, and without seeking validation from the listener.

6.  **The Joy of Sangha:** The participants expressed deep appreciation for the supportive, organic, and free-flowing format of sharing with like-minded friends (the Sangha). This fellowship is seen as a vital part of the path, providing joy and a space to refine one's understanding through discussion.

**Key Metaphors and Phrases:**
*   **"Alive stillness" of nature:** The vibrant yet peaceful quality of the forest.
*   **"Dhamma bombs":** Insights or teachings that may be understood and "explode" into understanding later.
*   **"On the Wings of Awakening":** A playful name highlighting the two supporting wings of practice: **samatha** (calm) and **vipassana** (insight).
*   **"Anchored to the breath":** Using the breath as a steady point of focus amidst internal and external changes.
*   **"Crab cage" of social validation:** The idea of breaking free from the pull of societal expectations and others' opinions.

In essence, the talk was a shared reflection on how seclusion in nature deepens meditation practice, how Anapanasati serves as a complete and portable path to peace, and how cultivating inner independence and calm allows one to live contentedly and share the Dhamma freely with the world.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their experiences with meditation, nature, and the Dharma. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Nature as a Mirror for "True Nature":**
    *   Speaker A describes being in the woods as being in a place that is "untouched, unconditioned, still." They explicitly state that nature is "really, really near, if not it is actually the representation of true nature of oneself." The forest's "alive stillness" becomes a metaphor for the mind's fundamental, peaceful state.

2.  **The Breath as an Anchor:**
    *   A central metaphor used by Speaker A and reinforced by others. When the internal world of thoughts and memories becomes overwhelming ("a whole world that is equally infinite inside of your mind"), the breath is the constant, reliable "anchor" to which one can return for stability and grounding.

3.  **Carrying a Briefcase:**
    *   Speaker D introduces this metaphor for the burdensome sense of self. We carry around thoughts, feelings, and identities like important files in a briefcase, believing they are "us." The realization in meditation is that we can "put it back down" because the files (mental constructs) aren't truly ours or necessary.

4.  **The Dharma Bomb:**
    *   Speaker E recalls this term from Dhammarato. Sharing a Dharma insight is like planting a "Dharma bomb"—a seed of understanding that may not explode (be understood) immediately, but can "go off later" when conditions are right for the listener.

5.  **Fractals / Dance Steps / Music:**
    *   The practice of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) is described in non-linear, organic metaphors:
        *   **Fractals:** Speaker A mentions the "fractal way" of the practice, suggesting the same patterns (calm, insight) repeat at every level.
        *   **Dance Steps:** Speaker B recalls that the 16 steps of Anapanasati have been discussed not as a rigid sequence, but like "dance steps" that flow into one another.
        *   **Music/Scales:** Speaker D expands on this, comparing the practice to learning musical "scales and chords"—a set of skills that allow for fluid and beautiful expression rather than mechanical repetition.

6.  **The Crab Cage:**
    *   Speaker E uses this to describe social conditioning and the pressure to conform. When you find peace outside societal norms (like not needing a traditional vacation), others may try to pull you back into the "crab cage" of expectations. Freedom is saying, "claws off."

7.  **Seeds and Trees:**
    *   A few variations appear:
        *   Speaker D says the complete teaching is in the first step of Anapanasati, and "it just grows just like a tree. Seed has the entire tree in it."
        *   He also talks about sharing Dharma as putting a seed "wrapped in toilet paper" in someone's pocket, hoping it will get rained on (find the right conditions) and sprout later.

8.  **On the Wings of Awakening:**
    *   Speaker E jokingly suggests this as a band name, but it refers to the common Buddhist metaphor of **Samatha (calm) and Vipassana (insight) as the two wings** necessary for the bird of wisdom to fly. The group discusses how these two qualities support and balance each other.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Personal Journey to Seclusion:**
    *   Speaker A shares a story of their evolving practice: from meditating in challenging, crowded places to prove a point, to realizing the profound value of physical and mental **seclusion**. They describe how this shift changed their purpose—meditation is no longer to be "a better man in society" but for its own sake, leading to a discovery of the vast "underworld" of the mind.

2.  **Driving to the Wat as Practice:**
    *   Speaker C shares that the 45-minute drive to the temple (Wat) is itself a practice. The story illustrates how Mara (the personification of distraction/temptation) tries to convince him not to go, but making the trip is an act of commitment that is "always worth it."

3.  **Overcoming the Fear of Being Alone:**
    *   Speaker D shares a personal history: "I used to have a lot of fears when I was younger about being alone." The practice allowed a reframe from "oh no, I'm alone" to the joyful "oh boy, I'm alone." This is a story of transforming a deep-seated anxiety through insight.

4.  **Sharing Dharma in Daily Life:**
    *   Multiple speakers share mini-stories about sharing their practice:
        *   Speaker E talks about answering "How are you?" with "I'm calm and I don't have any stress," which sparks curiosity and opens a door to talk about meditation.
        *   Speaker D mentions a friend asking, "what's different?" about him, leading to a Dhamma conversation and building a local group.
        *   Speaker C shares the insight of no longer needing a physical vacation because he and his wife are "always on vacation" in a state of contentment, breaking free from social expectations.

5.  **Letting Go of Validation:**
    *   Speaker E tells a story of personal growth over years, moving from seeking validation from "students or family or strangers" to a point where that need has dropped away. This is framed as a story of increasing confidence and freedom, where others' opinions become like crabs trying to pull you back into a cage.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of a practice that is organic, liberating, and deeply personal, using relatable imagery to describe internal shifts and insights.
