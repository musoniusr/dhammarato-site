### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, you were asking a question about good and bad and right and wrong in relationship to morality and Sila. And actually, having a lot of rules about what it should be, etc., like that actually causes a lot of harm. In other words, you go around labeling things as right and wrong and good and bad. All right, now the Sila is actually, uh, let us say the precepts, which is often referred to as Sila, was something that was developed long after the Buddha. And having ceremonies where people take the Five Precepts happened many, many centuries after the Buddha. That what the Buddha taught was, is that when the mind is free from the hindrances, when the mind doesn't want anything, when the mind is noble and unified and you don't want anything, then you're unlikely to cause harm, you're unlikely to cause people suffering by killing, stealing, gossiping, taking advantage of, etc. like that. He did not codify that stuff, rather he taught that this is the quality of the noble mind. It was ordinary people who took it out of context and made it into precepts and more rules, which he actually was against. I do not think that the Buddha would approve of people having ceremonies where they take the precepts. And not only that, but the precepts are almost always given with the uh, with the Triple Gem. Buddha, I'm certain, I'm good. Dhamma, I'm certain I'm good. Dhamma, Sangha, I'm certain I'm good. Dukkha, I'm good. I'm certain I'm good. You probably, if you've been there at all, you probably heard that.

**Speaker B:** I've heard it.

**Speaker A:** I think other people say it. That's just done next in that ceremony, and that is, uh, Anapanasati, Sakadagami, Samatha, Anicca. Now, in this regard, what I'm talking about is that taking the Triple Gem, taking it as a ceremony or as a vow, the Buddha would not be quite so against that, as he would point out that that's what an ordinary mind does. And so when the monks give these precepts and the Triple Gem, they assume that the people that they're doing this with are ordinary people who do not have the wisdom to actually take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and so they make it into a ceremony instead. They also assume that these are ordinary people who do not have the wisdom and the noble mind, which would then keep them from harming others. So basically, the Pali word of abhihimsa means to do no harm, which goes exactly right back to what the Buddha was talking about and teaching in the sense of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Dukkha in this regard means, with Abhihimsa, means to refrain from causing trouble to other people. This is in fact part of the reason why I was recommending don't ask questions, don't bother or trouble the monks with questions. Does that make sense now? Okay, because.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Um, the only rule that you really ever need is that rule of do no harm. Do what you will but create no harm.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** Um, now you say that sometimes here's a hard part, and that is, is that the harm Like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. In that regard, you may have to do a little bit of mind reading.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to ask.

**Speaker A:** And the right way to do that is to read one's own mind and don't do the things that cause you harm, cause you to see harm. Because that's more than likely going to be the same thing with others. By Jesus's Golden Rule, for instance, is based upon a rule: do unto others the way that you want to be treated. But that's not wisdom, that's a rule. Wisdom would be treat other people the way they want to be treated And that takes a little bit of mind reading. So first step would be treat other people the way you want to be treated, but then real wisdom would be treat people the way they want to be treated.

**Speaker B:** And how would you say to read others' minds? To just be attentive?

**Speaker A:** Yes, look closely, but also look closely within your own mind. Begin to see that anytime that you're thinking about other people, every time you're thinking about the past and the future— see, that's basically what we're talking about here. And the right advice for me to give you would be forget about the what. You're not at the what right now. Be here now. Okay, so that's basically the whole point then, is that we do talk about, uh, certain behavior, but the behavior that I'm, uh, talking about is the quality of be here now when you're at the watch.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that clears up a lot. Thank you. Sorry, did you have something to say?

**Speaker A:** No. Does that cover it for you?

**Speaker B:** I think so. And then just to make sure I'm getting it right, so the mind that's satisfied and a noble mind will— not causing harm towards others because it would just be satisfied. And so you'll be following the Sila that is prescribed. Yes, it's like the outcome.

**Speaker A:** We're not interested in following Sila. We're interested in not causing harm to ourselves or to others. That's the teaching of the Buddha. Like I said, Sila and the precepts came centuries later. It came as a— brought in the Buddha? Never.

**Speaker B:** The Buddha never talked about the precepts.

**Speaker A:** Or— yeah, the precepts did not exist in the time of the Buddha. What existed was the teaching that when the mind is noble, one refrains from being harmful.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so they took that and turned it into a rule of thou shalt not cause harm, which is in fact not actually the way that the Buddha would teach. And not only that, but it assumes that the person is going to be ordinary and they need a set of rules.

**Speaker B:** I guess that also I had another question around ordinary versus noble. Why do people, or why do monks or anyone teach the ordinary path? Or why don't they— why doesn't everyone just teach the noble?

**Speaker A:** Because 99% of the people are ordinary. The problem is that if all there is teaching is the ordinary path, then those who are ready to hear the Noble Dharma won't hear it because the monks are teaching ordinary people. This is the reason that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po wanted me to teach the supramundane, the Noble Dharma, Because those who are ordinary and don't get it, they're going to leave and there's no problem. The ones who keep coming back are the ones who are capable of understanding the noble teaching, that teaching which is above the others. So rules and precepts and Sila is the ground force for ordinary people, and wisdom, Pañña, seeing things clearly, seeing Dukkha for what it is That's for the noble mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And most people are just not going to get it.

**Speaker B:** You think like there could be a case for you start on the ordinary path and then you like graduate to the noble path and that's why people—.

**Speaker A:** That's the only way it can be done. But the way that it's normally done is go start at the ordinary path and never graduate. 99% of the Buddhists never graduate. 100% of the Christians, they never graduate out of the ordinary magical thinking. I need help, I need a Jesus, I need a savior, into the noble mind of this is my job to track. This is something that needs to be looked at with right noble view, viewing. Okay, so, uh, so long as the ordinary people keep going to the wat, loving the ceremonies, the monks don't get a chance to talk to them about, or, uh, noble things. And so it would be better for you to not ask questions until they get to know you better, keep going back to the what. Because in fact, the reality is that what Abhayagiri, which by the way means fearless mountain Actually, the word fearless doesn't work very well. Let us say free from fear, secure mountain. Okay, fearless is actually an ordinary person's translation, but secure, safe, safe mountain, that would be a more noble way of saying it.

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a place where I want to go, a safe mountain.

**Speaker A:** All right. So the monks there were trained under Acharya Chah and Acharya Samadhi and other monks who were actually also students of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. So the likelihood of the senior monks being noble there is quite high. But they still have almost everybody who comes to visit is ordinary people. That's why they give precepts and the Triple Gem and ceremonies and rituals and whatnot. They're nobles giving ordinary things to ordinary people because the ordinary people in general are not ready for the noble?

**Speaker B:** I have, like, during the time I'm staying there, there's like a good chunk of the day where I can just kind of do whatever. Would you like recommend that I do like longer satsang?

**Speaker A:** I would recommend during the time when there is nothing to do, Do nothing.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Stay in seclusion. Don't go find work to do. In fact, stay away from the guy who's got the clipboard out looking for people to do work.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because ordinary people, they want to lend a helping hand. And so they'll put them to work. But if you're there for the real reason for being at Tawad, which is having a chance to practice correctly— and the most correct practice is nothing at all. And so we start with the wholesome, keep having wholesome thoughts. Everything is fine, everything is beautiful, no problems, no worries. And eventually there's nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** That'S all I had to ask. Well, it ended up being a lot more questions than anticipated.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you later then. Enjoy your trip.

**Speaker B:** I will. Thank you, appreciate everything.

**Speaker A:** All righty, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Thesis: The Origin and Purpose of Sila (Morality)**
The speaker makes a provocative historical claim: the formal **Five Precepts** and ceremonial vow-taking were developed centuries after the Buddha. The Buddha's actual teaching on morality was not a list of rules but a **natural outcome of a cultivated mind**.

### **The Buddha's Teaching vs. Later Tradition**
*   **What the Buddha Taught:** When the mind is **noble, unified, free from hindrances, and without craving**, it naturally refrains from causing harm (killing, stealing, gossiping, etc.). Morality flows from inner wisdom (*pañña*), not external rules.
*   **What Developed Later:** Ordinary people codified this natural result into **precepts and ceremonies**. While useful for the majority, this "ordinary path" can become a substitute for developing the noble mind itself. The speaker suggests the Buddha would not approve of ceremonial vow-taking, as it caters to an "ordinary" mindset.

### **The One Essential Rule: Do No Harm (Abhihimsa)**
The ultimate guiding principle is **"Do no harm."** This aligns directly with the Buddha's teaching on the end of suffering (*dukkha nirodha*). All moral conduct should stem from this intention.

### **The Challenge of Applying "Do No Harm"**
A complication arises because harm is subjective ("beauty is in the eye of the beholder"). The speaker outlines a progression in ethical understanding:
1.  **The Rule (Ordinary):** "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." (The Golden Rule)
2.  **The Wisdom (Noble):** "Treat others **the way they want to be treated**." This requires empathetic attention—"reading minds" by being fully present and observant.

### **Ordinary Path vs. Noble Path**
*   **Ordinary Path:** Based on **rules, rituals, and precepts** (Sila). This is what 99% of people, including most monastics, teach and follow. It's a necessary starting ground.
*   **Noble Path:** Based on **direct wisdom and understanding** (*pañña*), seeing the nature of suffering for oneself. This is the Buddha's supramundane teaching.
*   **The Problem:** If only the ordinary path is taught, those ready for the noble teachings may never hear them. The speaker's role, as requested by teachers like Buddhadasa, is to teach the noble Dharma so those who are ready can "graduate" from the ordinary.

### **Practical Advice for the Retreatant**
For the listener going to Abhayagiri Monastery:
*   **Interacting with Monks:** Initially, **don't ask questions** or trouble the monks. They primarily deal with ordinary visitors and provide ceremonies. Let them get to know you first.
*   **During Free Time:** **Do nothing.** Embrace seclusion. The "most correct practice" is often non-doing. Avoid the impulse to "help out" with work; use the time for genuine practice.
*   **Practice Method:** Cultivate **wholesome thoughts** ("everything is fine, beautiful, no problems") until the mind settles into simplicity.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that **true morality is an inside-out process**. While precepts are a useful social convention for the ordinary mind, the heart of the Dharma points toward cultivating a **noble, satisfied mind** from which non-harming action flows naturally. The ultimate goal is to develop wisdom, not just follow rules.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Buddhist practice, the "ordinary" versus "noble" mind, and the pitfalls of rules. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors and Analogies:**

1.  **The "Ordinary" vs. "Noble" Mind (and Path):** This is the central framing metaphor.
    *   **The Ordinary Mind/Path:** Characterized by needing **rules, ceremonies, precepts, and external guidance** (like the Triple Gem ceremony). It's compared to "magical thinking" in Christianity—waiting for a savior or external help. The speaker says 99% of people are on this path and "never graduate."
    *   **The Noble Mind/Path:** Characterized by **internal wisdom (*pañña*), a mind free from want, and the natural outcome of not causing harm.** It's not about following rules but about a fundamental shift in perception. The teaching for this mind is called the "supramundane" or "Noble Dharma."

2.  **Graduation / Education System:** The speaker uses the metaphor of schooling to describe the spiritual path.
    *   *"You start on the ordinary path and then you like **graduate** to the noble path."*
    *   *"The way that it's normally done is go start at the ordinary path and **never graduate.**"*
    This frames the progression from rule-based practice to wisdom-based understanding as an educational advancement.

3.  **"Do No Harm" as the Single Rule:** While arguing against codified rules (precepts), the speaker offers **"do no harm" (*abhihimsa*)** as the essential guiding principle, comparing it to a universal baseline from which true wisdom grows.

4.  **The Golden Rule (Revised):** The speaker uses the well-known story of the Golden Rule to distinguish between rule-following and wisdom.
    *   **The Rule (Ordinary):** *"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."* (Treat others how **you** want to be treated.)
    *   **The Wisdom (Noble):** *"Treat other people the way **they** want to be treated."* This requires empathetic attention ("mind reading").

5.  **"Mind Reading":** This is a metaphorical term for **empathy and attentive observation.** The path to wisdom involves "reading" others' minds not supernaturally, but by "look[ing] closely" at them and, more importantly, by "look[ing] closely within your own mind" to understand cause and effect of harm.

6.  **Abhayagiri as "Safe Mountain":** The speaker critiques the common translation of *Abhayagiri* (a monastery name) as "fearless mountain" as an "ordinary person's translation." They reframe it with a more "noble" metaphor: **"secure mountain" or "safe mountain."** This subtly reinforces the theme of the noble path providing true, internal security versus the ordinary path's more bravado-filled "fearlessness."

### **Implied Stories / Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Historical Degeneration of the Teaching:** The speaker tells a **story of decline** over centuries: The Buddha taught the **quality of the noble mind** (which naturally avoids harm). Later, "ordinary people" codified this into the **precepts and ceremonies** (like taking the Five Precepts), which the Buddha would have been "against" because they become external rules instead of internal understanding.

2.  **The Monks' Dilemma:** There's an implied **story about the monastic community**. The senior monks at places like Abhayagiri likely understand the noble teaching (having studied under great masters like Ajahn Chah). However, because almost all visitors are "ordinary," they must provide the ceremonies, precepts, and rituals that ordinary people expect and need. This creates a gap where the noble teaching is rarely heard.

3.  **The "Guy with the Clipboard":** This is a brief, **cautionary vignette** about the retreat environment. The "guy with the clipboard" represents the pull of **wholesome busywork** (the ordinary path of helpful action). The speaker advises avoiding this to pursue the "real reason" for being at the *wat*: doing **"nothing at all"** in seclusion, which is the "most correct practice" for developing the noble mind.

**In summary,** the speaker uses metaphors of **education (graduation), internal vs. external guidance, and refined translations (safe mountain)** to argue that true Buddhist practice moves beyond ceremonial rules. The implied historical story frames current common practices as a later dilution, while the advice to the listener paints a picture of choosing the quiet, "do nothing" path of wisdom over the active, rule-following path of ordinary religion.
