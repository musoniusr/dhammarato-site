### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, folks. It's January 18th, and today the topic will be on— as a request, the wording was toys. However, we needed to see that there's more than just one kind of toy. And that we'll discuss both of them. Now, generally what we mean by a toy is a plaything, which would be a noun. A toy can be seen, touched, perhaps bitten on and tasted, touched, etc., like that. And so normally when we think of a toy, we think of an external object. Now, the reason why we play with toys, first off as children and then later on as adults, we often call them hobbies. Some people call it work. But when we are playing with a toy, the object is to get some sort of pleasure from that object. And that, as you've heard me speak recently, that the Buddha says, and it's quite obvious from understanding his teachings on Paticcasamuppada, that pleasure-seeking is built right in. That Dukkha is not a built-in thing. Dukkha is something that we do We almost always do it when we don't get what we want, which is pleasure, from our toys. Now that's profound, that in fact if we can turn the thing upside down for just a moment, when we understand that the Buddha says that he teaches only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, Another way of looking at it is that if we can find pleasure in the right way, in the correct way, then by finding our pleasure, we do not have the displeasure of not getting what we want. This is an important point now, because a lot of what the Buddha teaches has to do with gaining pleasure in all the wrong places, gaining pleasure through sense objects. And so, we're looking for gratification, we're looking for pleasure, and that as we, let us say, become more sophisticated, educated, knowledgeable about our gratifications and our pleasures, we begin to see that many of what we thought was going to give us our pleasure actually is quite dangerous. And when we can see the danger, then we can find an escape. But until we're seeing the danger, In other words, you can see the Dukkha 5 seconds ahead, then we can only stay at the level of seeking pleasure and gratification. So if we can then change this just a little bit from the outside to the inside, we can see then that there are many toys that people have inside their minds, like views, belief systems, ideas, concepts, etc., like that. And that we often will cling to those as mine, even stronger than we would cling to a toy. For instance, a toy could break, and we can just merely replace it without having a lot of attachment to it. But if we have a worldview of belief, and that gets broken, now we can really be in danger, really suffering, because it seems like that about half of us, or half of each individual person, is destroyed when their favorite belief is destroyed. And in that regard, what we would mean then, that most of our beliefs are dangerous. Most of our beliefs, in fact all of the beliefs— the only kind of belief that would not be dangerous would be a belief that something exists, and it actually does exist. So we're talking about the difference then between reality Now, if we know reality, that's not a belief, that's knowledge. And much of what we teach is to look and to see, to look inside, to see our beliefs and our ways of holding opinions, etc., like that. And that if we begin to understand how dangerous it is to hold a belief that we have no evidence for. That's dangerous, and we will cling to it even in the face of solid evidence. This would be called absolute denial or delusion, is that the facts are there, but we refuse to look at the facts, because they do not fit what we think or believe is true. This is, let us say, the basis for almost all religions. Religion is based upon beliefs that this might be true, when in fact they've got no evidence that it would be true. Much of the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is actually quite true. All of it's true and easily seen. But unfortunately, besides the teaching of the Buddha, there has grown up a religion called Buddhism, and that almost all of Buddhism is based upon beliefs, doesn't have any reality to it. But people will cling to those beliefs because, uh, it would destroy their idea of who they are if that belief was found to not be the case. And that's also, uh, true in the sense of how much time, effort, how many years one has put into it, etc., like that. So we can take just any religion as an example, but I would like to take parts of Buddhism as the example here is that there has become a kind of Buddhism that's grown up in the West that I'm, you know, I've been calling Western Buddhism, that is founded upon a lot of beliefs that do not have solid evidence for them. And yet a lot of people will cling to these beliefs. And put a lot of energy and a lot of effort into finding the truth in them, but never quite find that truth. And you can also go so far as to say, when people are looking for truth, what they're actually looking for is gratification. They're actually looking for the pleasure of being proven right. Often we don't get that, and so we keep looking and keep looking. It's almost like we're gold miners, thinking that if I find that big nugget of gold, that I will have an easy life, and the thought is it will give me great pleasure. So we go panhandling and find that the stream or the creek that we're on has thousands of panhandlers there, all of them looking for a nugget of gold. So this is what we will find in a religion, is a whole lot of gold diggers coming together because they think that the gold is in the church or in the stream or in the meditation hall, and they're all out there digging for gold, hoping to find the pleasure and generally being disappointed because they don't find the pleasure. They don't find it. That's one of the big dangers then, is that there is no pleasure in where we're looking. There was a song, "Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places." Well, what is love then, if we are not looking for pleasure? But we're looking for pleasure in something else, in another person, in a girl, in love with a dress, in love with a car, or whatever like this, is because we really like it a lot. Then in fact, that's generally how the word love is used, is liking it a lot. And that, uh, uh, what Buddha talks about is when we like something, that's called Tanha, or thirst, that we want it. And when we like it a lot or love it, that generally is translated as Upadana, or clinging. And this is where the self comes in, is that when I love something, it's I that does the loving. We can just like something and the liking is there, but when we love it, that's when the 'I' is created, and the 'I' then becomes disappointed because what we thought was the love was not what we were looking for in the first place. It changed or something. Everything is changing, and an example of that is partners grow old. Sometimes they grow grumpy. Sometimes they grow greedy. And so the one that we loved in the first place is no longer lovable according to our standards. And yet when we started to look for the love, we didn't understand the dangers therein. Buddha did this on several occasions when he would point out to the monks that when you see a young beautiful girl, recognize that she's going to get old. She's going to get old and perhaps frail and need you to take care of her because times change. And so, uh, this whole concept of, um, greedy— we start off greedy, looking for gratification, not recognizing the dangers. Well, There is a way of thinking, and that is that the toys that we have do not have to have an object, even if they're just in the mind. A mental toy that would be safe and worthy of pursuit would not be a concept, an idea, or belief. It's just other than that, just the experience of feeling good. Just developing joy for joy's sake without having to have some sort of object, the object being on the outside of a car or a laptop or a girlfriend or something like that that we're trying to find our joy in. But also on the inside, we would have concepts, ideas, perhaps in some cases mathematics, belief systems, etc., like that. And we think that we're going to find joy in that belief if we can prove it's true. But generally we cannot ever prove that it's true because it was always a belief. Everybody held it a belief. Nobody has any actual knowledge of it. And yet we cling to that belief as if it were true. And are constantly disappointed whenever someone points out, "You don't know. You're just clinging to something that is an idea. It's got no basis of reality other than in one's mind." So if we can set down or set aside— in fact, that word "set aside" would be a very valuable word to start using. That you can actually set aside your beliefs, set aside your values, set aside all of that stuff that's mental, unproven stuff, and start looking directly at everything is okay. Look at the reality is, is that you're already all right, that you can find pleasure in the reality that can be discovered, seen, and known. And so this is really the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha, and that we don't really need any toys to do that. However, once we have developed that skill of having pleasure, then we can take that pleasure into any and everything that we do. Normally we go about doing things because they need to be done, they should be done, we're paid for them to be done, and we do that stuff, but we don't really gain any pleasure from it. We actually postpone our pleasure in order to get the work done, rather than finding pleasure at whatever we are doing. So this would be the quality of making everything then back into a toy that gains pleasure for you. But one must develop pleasure independently of the toys. We have to bring that pleasure in, and the Buddha gave a specific path on how to do that. The Eightfold Noble Path, coupled with Anapanasati, where we change the unwholesome thoughts which are not pleasurable into wholesome thoughts which are pleasurable, gladdening the mind, making the mind have pleasure, changing our attitude from an attitude of a victim into the attitude of gaining pleasure from it. Being the winner within one's own mind rather than being a loser. And the loser's mentality would often be, oh, I can't meditate in various ways, or if I do gladden the mind, it's not gladdened enough, or if I do have satisfaction, it's not satisfying enough. That's the standard old habits that people have. Where they don't find the pleasure that they're actually looking for, because again, they're looking in the wrong place for it rather than going directly to that pleasure, directly into feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And being able to say a little bit of satisfaction is satisfaction enough. I don't have to have a lot of satisfaction, just a little, just enough right now. Yes, Ivan, what do you have?

**Speaker B:** I realize the ordinary mind, you know, the pleasure that we talk about here is— yeah, it's almost like it's hard to comprehend the good enough we talk about. Like, I realize sometimes the word confuses people, like good enough, and then people make up stories of, oh, good enough, like tolerating. Well, I guess what I'm just trying to say is like, so like, as long as the state of the mind is ordinary, it's really hard. I think that it's almost like ignorance itself, right? Because ignorance is almost like they don't even know what they're looking for. So, yeah.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, they don't, and that a lot of Western society talks about tolerance. Now, tolerance means that, in fact, you do not get any pleasure out of it, but you kind of put up with it. And so that's not the Buddhist path. The Buddhist path would be finding the pleasure in whatever is happening. Now, there are— actually, there's one sutta, number 2, in the Sabbāsava Sutta, where the Buddha does talk about endurance. But the endurance that the Buddha is talking about is enduring the things that you cannot do anything about, or that you've done something about and eliminated a lot of it, but there is still there. The examples that he uses is cold, heat, gadflies, mosquitoes, etc., like that. And that one can gain pleasure by tolerating heat. I can handle this. We can gain pleasure by tolerating cold. And so if we can gain our pleasure in our endurance, then that endurance is successful. But if we are just merely tolerating it, hoping to get away from it, not liking it, but putting up with it, then that is not worth doing. In fact, we wind up not liking it, but we try to lie to ourselves, hide that not liking, rather than being able to change it, to change the mind to be in a state of pleasure, so that we're good to go with anything. Which means then anything that would be clung to that does not give pleasure, you can set that aside. Now let's use an example of, does God exist? Does God exist? Timo, does God exist?

**Speaker B:** Depends on what that means.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a good start. Whatever it means though, it can be set aside. And here's one point about that, and that is generally ever how God is described, we cannot find that God. That God is not evident. And so some will then say, oh, well, God is not evident because of this or that reason, and then they still can hold to that God. Does it exist? And the correct way is set God aside so that we can go back to gaining pleasure, because you can gain pleasure whether God exists or not. But you've got no evidence that God exists if you put your time and effort own God, you'll wind up not gaining the pleasure that you were basically built to seek. Another point along with that would be rebirth or reincarnation. It's almost always a belief because nobody knows. Ivan, do you know anybody who knows that rebirth and reincarnation exist? One or the other.

**Speaker B:** I mean, people that usually talk about this or not seems to be very uptight and not happy.

**Speaker A:** People who believe in things then wind up being uptight about it because they do not want to be contradicted, because if they're contradicted they will feel bad. And the right way to do that then is to just simply set it aside and go back to finding the pleasure. Now, let's use another example. Amrit, are you here?

**Speaker B:** Yes, Dhammarato, I'm listening.

**Speaker A:** How about vegetarians? People— What about— Yeah, people, the vegetarians or those who call themselves vegetarian will say vegetarian is good and eating meat is bad. And therefore they want to go on some sort of crusade to get other people to become vegetarians, perhaps in the hope of making sure that their vegetarian is real. The fact is, is they don't know whether vegetarian is good or not. They've just got a belief system. And just as Ivan was saying, vegetarians generally wind up being pretty uptight because of their beliefs. Is that not correct?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's definitely correct, Dhammarato. I am a vegetarian, but I am not uptight, and I don't believe it is good or bad, so I just put it aside, and I don't care to convert anybody else about it.

**Speaker A:** So whether you're a vegetarian or not, you can simply set that aside and go about finding pleasure in all the right places. And the places that are right would be twofold. One is that they're not dangerous, and number two, you can find pleasure there that's not dangerous, rather than seeking pleasure where it cannot be found. And yet, look at how many people who call themselves vegetarians are looking for pleasure within that concept of being vegetarian. The same thing then is true of those who believe in God. They're looking for pleasure in proving that God is correct. And Ivan, you already mentioned about the rebirth. People who claim to rebirth, they want you to believe in rebirth too so that they can gain some pleasure in your agreement with it, to where in fact all of that too can merely be set aside. We don't have to fix anybody, we don't have to convert anybody, because in fact the real teaching of the Buddha is to go find pleasure where it may be found within the mind and set aside all of the other stuff. So we've done vegetarian, we've done rebirth, we've done God. We can do all of Christianity in the sense of the sky daddy, the no-sex baby, and the dead man walking, and the Trinity, and all of those kinds of things that are central to Christianity as a belief system. Nobody knows for sure about any of that stuff. And so we can set the whole belief system aside because it's irrelevant for finding pleasure, though look how many people are trying to find pleasure there. All right, so in that regard, many Christians are actually going to church in order to find an experience, but they're not the only ones. Many, in fact, those who practice meditation in the form of Vipassana or Western Mahasi, they are looking for experience. They want a high experience because that experience then will prove to them that they were right in their beliefs. And so they will gain pleasure by having an experience. The problem with that experience is it's very short-lived. It's not developed. It's just a moment. And so then they'll go around looking for that experience again in order to justify their beliefs, looking for an experience.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, what about, what about if someone is looking for, uh, hey, I want to see that, um, that, yeah, reality is Anicca. Is that also the bad kind of experience that we avoid? Can you clarify?

**Speaker A:** All right, now here's an important point about that. Anicca is clear. Anicca is obvious.

**Speaker B:** Been unlocked.

**Speaker A:** In fact, a lot of people who cling to Anicca are clinging to Anicca so much that they don't even see the changes that are being made while they cling to it, right? Rather than just say things are changing, you can gain great pleasure by just merely watching things change.

**Speaker B:** Then by that definition, a practitioner that practice that way, they are not looking for an experience, they are actually paying attention to reality, right? There is a distinction there.

**Speaker A:** Well, except for one thing, and that is how much looking does it take to see things are constantly changing? Okay, because things are changing now, and the next time you look, yeah, they're changing. Why should I try to dig deep into it? That in fact, Anicca, within this group that we've been talking about, connected with the three characteristics of Trimokkha, they call it Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. Now, the Buddha talked about Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat, but not as a collected group. He talks about Dukkha in the sense of the First Noble Truth, to be able to see the Dukkha. But he did not— there's not even one sutta where Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat are the topic of the talk. That Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat is something that was kind of invented through the Vasudhi Marga and become a practice, and that practice of seeing Anicca, Dukkha, and Samatha actually then became a substitute for the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, the practice of Anapanasati, and the Satipatthana. That they do talk about the Satipatthana, but they don't talk about it as a complete practice. And so they elevate these things, making Dukkha a great big thing that needs to be analyzed, dissected, completely understood. If you completely understand Dukkha, you will be free from it, is the way they talk, except for one thing, and that is it goes against the teaching of the Buddha. If you see Dukkha, avoid it immediately. And if you analyze this Dukkha day after day after day after day, you'll wind up in some dark space. Then in fact the whole point was to find pleasure. How can we find pleasure in analyzing Dukkha when in fact we know that we can find pleasure by simply avoiding Dukkha, getting out of its way? And so these people who analyze the Dukkha through this Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta complex, they wind up not finding the pleasure that they were looking for, and yet they will cling to that practice. In fact, the more they do the practice, the more they cling to it, and they will refuse to find the pleasure where it can be found. And for that reason, then, they're not actually practicing the teaching of the Buddha. They're not actually finding the pleasure.

**Speaker B:** Can we, can we do a quick reminder of how to find the pleasure?

**Speaker A:** All right, Jonas, here is how we find pleasure. Do it with me right now. Take a deep breath and come into this present moment, not in the thoughts of the past, not in the thoughts of the future, but right now in this present moment. Everything is okay. Your mind is okay, your senses are okay, all six senses are okay. In that okayness, pleasure may be found right here, right now. This is pleasurable. Nothing happening, no place to go, nothing to do. Everything is all right. Right now. That's where your pleasure may be found. Now, in the past, we don't find pleasure. Normally what we find is either regret, remorse, or rebellion. But all three—regret, remorse, and rebellion—have the quality of being restless. In other words, if you see the real teaching of the Buddha and say, oh, those people who are practicing Vipassana are wrong, then I'm going to rebel against that, trying to hope to get those people fixed. Now, for my own example, I was raised in the church. However, I became disenchanted with the church. I became angry at the church at about the age of 3. And stayed in a state of rebellion all throughout my young years into my teens, and by the time I was 20, I could just wash my hands of the church or just set it aside, because I was no longer in rebellion to the church. So, when I'm talking about Vipassana, as a practice, the people are not finding any pleasure there, let's not then have any rebellion against their practice, but rather let's find pleasure in this practice. Now there's a difference between remorse and regret. Regret is almost always an action that we've regretted doing, to where remorse is much more on the inside. And whenever a thought of remorse or regret comes up, see that as what it is—it's regret. Often regret, in fact, is painful, instantly painful. People will actually groan out loud when they have an old memory that they regret. Can you see that that old regret is just an old thought? And that you can change it right now. Oh, what a relief it is! I don't have to think about that regret. Oh, what a relief it is! I don't have to think about that remorse. Oh, what a relief it is! I don't have to think about the rebellion against other people doing what they are doing. And so we can throw that hindrance right out and say, wow, how peaceful, how quiet, how easy it is to not worry, to not care, to be okay. Everything is already right now okay. Can you find any pleasure in that, Jonas? Wow, everything is fine right now. Not a problem in the world right now.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, it's a great relief. It's great. It's like a lot of thoughts and, um, a lot of thoughts that are Dukkha creating, they feel like heavy. They feel like a heavy load. And it's so— it feels so good just to, just to put that load aside.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like if we have a rebellion against the way people, uh, are practicing, look how many people you were carrying around. What an enormous load that is to see Vipassana. "Oh, that's so heavy! Oh, it's destroying Buddhism! Oh, poor me!" Or regret, in the sense of the regret is even heavier than the rebellion, because the remorse can't be fixed. It can't be fixed because it's already happened. And you can look back. In fact, it'll probably happen within the next week or so that you will actually remember and regret over something that happened years ago. You're the only one who remembers it, probably. Maybe in kind, like in my case, everybody that was there at that scene is dead now. Nobody cares anymore. Why should I care? Let me be in this present moment rather than in my mind remorsing, regretting. And so the joy may be found right here, right now. All we have to do is stop remorsing, regretting, rebelling, and just be in the present moment. Everything right now is okay. And also wanting something that we don't have. But in fact, that's the main source of Dukkha, is wanting something that we don't have. Like wanting to convert all of those Vipassana people so that they practice correctly. That is a terrible burden to carry around. Leave those poor people alone. You don't have to fix them. They're already okay. They're already suffering enough without you coming to prove them wrong. And so let's not deal with those other people. Let's not try to fix anybody. Let's not try to fix the Christians. Let's not try to fix Islam. Let's not try to fix the government. Let's leave it alone and just sit here and relax and find the pleasure where it may be found right here, right now, without any of that stuff. So, but looking and trying to find pleasure out there someplace is bound to disappoint you, bringing you not into pleasure but into displeasure, dissatisfaction. And so let us practice correctly to be right here, right now, where everything is already okay. And we can be satisfied with the way things are right now. So, Eddie O, Eddie Leo, what do you have to say about this? Good morning, everyone. Do you listen to me? Yes, I hear you. Yes, put down belief toy and Anagami toy is a good, and enjoy here and now is a very good thing, I think. Yes, the mind is the best toy that you'll ever find. Yes, yes. You can gain great pleasure. Yes, but let's not fill it up with other people and with places for that mind to go and things for it to do, but rather just enjoy the mind empty with no place to go and nothing to do, and everything is okay right now. Yes, thank you very much, Dhammarato, for this. I am I am receiving some things, I think. All right. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Garantha, good to see you. Good to see you too, Dhammarato. So— Thank you very much. You've been around for a long, long time, but now I'm glad to see you coming back. What do you think about today's talk on toys and pleasure?

**Speaker B:** I joined late. I'm here up in Canada.

**Speaker A:** And so.

**Speaker B:** Good morning, I guess, for those around here.

**Speaker A:** It's so apologies for that. So I didn't hear about toys, but yes, mind is a toy.

**Speaker B:** And it's great to remember to, I.

**Speaker A:** Guess, enjoy, enjoy the time without pulling up opinions, looking for love in the opinions and the beliefs and the ideas that you have. You can set all of those aside and just be here in the present moment. And enjoy being alive right now.

**Speaker B:** Agreed.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. So, Yanis, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you, Dhammarato. I really enjoyed this talk. And yeah, there is great pleasure to be found here now when you put aside the toys. Yeah, like last time I remember you said something about like if we cling to something and we try to get rid of it, you know, like for example smoking, but we do it in a dry way, then it feels like someone is trying to take a toy away from us. And so like we might cling to it even more. So yeah, like this is, you know, finding pleasure in the moment is a good way to find it easier to set aside also those kind of toys that we cling to.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and you could almost say that religions and secularism all are conspiring with and against each other to take away everybody's toys. Your toy is not good, you should switch your toy for my toy. Oh, but my toy is better than yours, you should switch your toy to my toy. And they wind up being in an argument and fighting over whose toy is the best, And in that particular moment, guess what? Nobody's actually enjoying the toy that they're promoting. I saw that big time around 2010 and before. There was a number of debates between atheists and Christians, and they would always find the debate of Does God exist or not? And the point was, is that nobody on stage, nobody in the audience, nobody changed their mind about does God exist or not. Whatever they came in with, they left with. But they also came in with no joy, and they left with no joy, no pleasure. But they tried to steal each other's joy. Steal each other's toy. You can't play with that toy, you've got to play with my toy. And you can see that in the argument between the Christians and the Muslims, between the Hindus and the Christians, between basically all the religions, except that everybody hates the Jews, and they're the most secular of all. They don't even care about their toy anymore. Because they didn't gain any pleasure from it. Their god happened to have been a warrior, and so they can set their god aside and just have a happy life. Wouldn't it be great if all of the religious people could set their religion aside and just be here now and be happy without having to carry all of those beliefs, all of those unproven stories that they carry around and just be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And that's also like, you need the skill to develop the skill to find pleasure here and now, because I think the reason we use those toys, whether it's religion or like distractions like smoking, etc., it's because We're trying to distract ourselves from what's currently here.

**Speaker A:** Actually looking for joy, we're looking for pleasure. We're not finding it. We don't find the joy and the pleasure of smoking. Maybe one inhale will be pleasurable, but the next and the next and the next winds up coughing and having cigarette tobacco stubs all over the place. So the joy is very short-lived, followed by a lot of danger. So, Pavan, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Having reflection after listening to you, it seems to me that I really don't have any control over other people. I don't have any control over my toy either. Probably I have control over the choice, right, to choose to be right now, for example.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can choose to set all of those toys, all those beliefs, all those opinions, all of those ideas— you can set them aside and just be here now. Everything is all right, everything is okay. You can put the past aside because that's where all of that stuff is. Or if you're in a state of rebellion, you're planning on the future to fix stuff. It's not even broken. Just be here in the present moment. Everything is all right right now. In fact, not a worry in the world. Wow, what a relief it is. Everything is okay and I don't have to fix anybody.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So does anybody else? Timo, do you have something else to say?

**Speaker B:** Could you say maybe something about finding the pleasure within, I'm not sure how to say it, within the mind itself versus generating it through the body and the feelings?

**Speaker A:** Well, all of those beliefs you made up. You perceived something Why don't we start perceiving pleasure? Let the pleasure contact us. Let our story be the story of pleasure. We can make that up. And guess what? The more practice we get at making pleasure, the better at it we get, and the higher the pleasures will go, so that we don't need to find pleasure out there, nor do we need to find pleasure in our beliefs, our ideas, etc. We can just find pleasure on its own. The Buddha was big on that. In fact, there are many suttas where he talks about it. In one sutta, he mentions that he will find pleasure wherever it may be found. Now what he was talking about was basically all of the jhanas. That the first jhana is in fact the path to freedom because that's the easy way to find joy and comfort and satisfaction right now. Anybody could do it right now. But the longer you sit, then that means that you might find pleasure and the mind being even more stable. But in all cases, in fact, the Buddha uses the term a pleasant abiding, that people who are just sitting around doing nothing are in a state of pleasure. So we can see then that the word pleasure and pleasant abiding is really at the core of what the Buddha is teaching. And that the Dukkha is what we're doing because we're looking for that joy and pleasure in the wrong place. But when we look for it in the right place, we find it. And then we can develop it as a skill.

**Speaker B:** It's almost like every time the practitioner looks for pleasure in the wrong place, that's the ignorance there immediately. Right. I mean, I'm just repeating what was said earlier because I thought that's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Say it again then.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm listening. Say it again one more time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, no. Yeah. So I realized over here in my experience, every time I see the mind trying to look for pleasure in, you know, places that don't really give me joy, I realize immediately that's the ignorance. And I don't have to make a story out of that because again, I was ignorant, so I can wake up right now. And yeah, it's almost like kind of interesting how it plays out when I wake up. Right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we can actually then say that ignorance is looking in all the wrong places.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Even stuff like looking at Dukkha and dissecting them, that's looking at the wrong places. Looking at belief, looking at the hindrances, and I mean, like, look at, in a sense, like people meditating on the hindrances and stuff like that. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Very good. All right, so does anybody else have anything to say? So Mikey, why don't you take this pleasure and shove it? Happily. Yes, thanks friends for being here today to listen to this Dhamma call. Y'all are welcome to hang out, stay, we can chat a while, share something on the practice.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, explores the theme of "toys" as a metaphor for the objects and mental constructs we cling to in our search for pleasure and happiness.

### **Core Summary:**

The central teaching is that **suffering (Dukkha) arises from seeking pleasure in the wrong places**—in external objects or unverified mental beliefs. The path to freedom is to **"set aside" these unreliable "toys" and learn to generate pleasure independently within the mind, in the present moment.**

### **Key Points:**

1.  **Two Kinds of Toys:**
    *   **External Toys:** Physical objects, hobbies, work, relationships—things we use to seek gratification.
    *   **Internal Toys:** Views, beliefs, ideologies, concepts (e.g., God, rebirth, strict vegetarianism, dogmatic Buddhist concepts like over-analyzing *anicca/dukkha/anatta*). We cling to these even more fiercely than to physical objects.

2.  **The Problem with Toys:** Seeking pleasure through these toys is inherently unreliable and dangerous because they are impermanent and often based on delusion (*avijjā*). When they fail or are challenged, we experience disappointment and suffering.

3.  **The Solution: Set Aside & Look Within:**
    *   **"Set Aside":** This is the key practical instruction. One should consciously set aside unverified beliefs and opinions to see reality clearly.
    *   **Find Pleasure in the Present:** The correct practice is to find pleasure and satisfaction (*sukha*) **here and now**, independent of any object or belief. The mind itself, when calm and unburdened, is the ultimate source of safe pleasure.
    *   **The Method:** Use the **Eightfold Path** and **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) to gladden the mind, change unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones, and cultivate a "pleasant abiding."

4.  **Critique of Common Missteps:**
    *   **"Western Buddhism" & Vipassana:** Dhammarato criticizes certain modern practices that over-intellectualize suffering (e.g., incessantly analyzing *dukkha*) or seek special "experiences" to validate beliefs. He argues this misses the point: the goal is to **find pleasure and escape *dukkha*, not to wallow in it**.
    *   **Religious Dogma:** All belief systems (Christianity, Islam, dogmatic Buddhism) are cited as examples of clinging to unproven "toys" that create tension and block genuine happiness.

5.  **Practical Instructions:**
    *   **Anchor in the Present:** Stop dwelling in past (regret/remorse) or future (rebellion/planning). Recognize that **right now, everything is okay**.
    *   **Drop the Burden:** Let go of the mental burden of trying to fix others, prove beliefs, or control the world.
    *   **Cultivate the Skill:** Generating internal pleasure is a skill developed through practice. Start with simple satisfaction: "a little bit of satisfaction is satisfaction enough."

### **Essence of the Talk:**

The Buddha's core teaching is reframed as a guide to finding reliable, harmless happiness. Instead of being "gold diggers" panning in the wrong streams (external toys and beliefs), we must learn to **find the gold of pleasure within our own minds, in the present moment, by setting aside all conceptual clutter.** True practice is about learning to "not worry, be happy" right here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching about seeking pleasure in the right way and letting go of unhelpful mental attachments. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. The “Toy” Metaphor (Central Metaphor)**
- **External toys** = physical objects, hobbies, work, relationships, etc., that people use to seek pleasure.
- **Internal toys** = beliefs, views, ideologies, religions, concepts (e.g., God, rebirth, vegetarianism as identity) that people cling to for pleasure or security.
- **Key point**: Just as a child’s toy can break and be replaced, mental “toys” (beliefs) can also be “set aside” when they don’t bring real pleasure or cause suffering.

---

### **2. The “Gold Miner / Gold Digger” Story**
- People in religions or spiritual practices are compared to **gold miners panning in a stream**, all searching for a “nugget of gold” (pleasure, truth, validation).
- They often don’t find it, because they’re looking in the wrong place—in external beliefs or group practices—rather than inside their own present-moment experience.

---

### **3. “Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places”**
- Reference to the famous song to illustrate how people seek pleasure (or “love”) in external things (cars, relationships, ideologies) rather than finding it within.
- Ties into the Buddha’s teaching on *Tanha* (thirst/craving) and *Upadana* (clinging).

---

### **4. The “Broken Belief” Analogy**
- If a physical toy breaks, we can replace it without much suffering.
- But if a deeply held **belief or worldview breaks**, it feels like “half of the person is destroyed”—showing how dangerous mental attachments can be.

---

### **5. The “Debate Between Atheists and Christians” Anecdote**
- Describes debates where no one changes their mind, no one finds joy, and each side tries to “steal the other’s toy” (convert them).
- Illustrates how arguing over beliefs steals present-moment pleasure and creates division without benefit.

---

### **6. The “Vegetarian/Uptight Believer” Example**
- Some vegetarians (or believers in God, rebirth, etc.) become “uptight” because their identity is tied to a belief.
- They seek pleasure through being “right” or converting others, rather than finding pleasure independent of the belief.

---

### **7. The “Carrying a Heavy Load” Metaphor**
- Holding onto regrets, rebellions, or desires to fix others is like **carrying a heavy burden**.
- Setting aside these mental toys brings relief—like putting down a heavy load.

---

### **8. The “Mind as the Best Toy”**
- The mind itself, when empty of clinging, peaceful, and present, is the “best toy”—it can generate pleasure without external objects or fixed beliefs.

---

### **9. The “Smoking” Example**
- Smoking gives brief pleasure but leads to coughing and health dangers—similar to how clinging to beliefs gives short-term validation but long-term suffering.

---

### **10. The “Vipassana Practitioner Analyzing Dukkha” Image**
- Some meditators are described as endlessly analyzing *Dukkha* (suffering), thinking freedom comes from dissecting it.
- The speaker contrasts this with the Buddha’s way: **see suffering, then immediately avoid it and cultivate pleasure in the present**.

---

### **11. The “Sky Daddy, No-Sex Baby, Dead Man Walking”**
- A humorous, critical metaphor for the Christian Trinity (Father God, Virgin Birth, Resurrection), used to show how belief systems are built on unverifiable stories that can be “set aside.”

---

### **Core Message Through Metaphors**:
Pleasure is not found in external or internal “toys” (beliefs, objects, identities), but in the present-moment mind free from clinging. The practice is to **set aside** unhelpful mental toys and **find pleasure right here, right now**, through mindfulness and a gentle, gladdened mind.
