### Transcript


**Speaker A:** But in fact, everything about Anapanasati is learning to take control. We take control of the breathing, we take control of the mind, we take control of the feelings. Then we take control of how the mind works so that we can take control of one's life. And in the process of this, we build enormous confidence. Okay, all right, let's talk about it then. First, Jhana, and we're going to talk about it in two different respects. One is the respect of how to get into it, and then the second respect is how to maintain it or sustain it and what do we do with it. That that's in fact one of the bigger issues that people have, is that especially in Western Buddhism, when they— you see, Western mindset is very attainment-oriented. And so when we hear words in, let us say, Western Buddhism that have to do with these attainments, then people lust for these things and they want them. And there's a whole bunch of them. There's 1, 2, 3, 4 Jhanas, and there's Srotapanna, Sotagami, Anagami, Arahant. There's enlightenment this and enlightenment that, all kinds of things for people who desire to gain attainments. This whole series of wanting something that we don't have is actually Buddha's definition of suffering. Clinging. So wanting enlightenment is a kind of clinging, and nobody's going to get enlightenment by wanting it. Okay, that in fact, if enlightenment is being free from wanting anything, then we have to practice being free from wanting anything, and then the enlightenment will happen naturally. But if we want to practice enlightenment, we'll never get anywhere, because we're stuck in a state of desire, we're stuck in a state of wanting. So we can say then that the first Jhana is actually getting the mind into a state of not wanting anything. That would be the way of looking at it, and this is exactly what we mean by it when we look at its various factors. There are 5 factors to the first Jhana, and there's one of them that is a key ingredient. And that key ingredient is that the mind is free from hindrances. That above all is the practice. Everything has to be done with being free from the hindrances. And so when we recognize that, then we begin to understand how to become free from the hindrances. Because as you were talking before about the 99 versus the 1, that means that whatever amount of time that's spent in hindrances, that's when you could have been spending your time in freedom instead. But you spend a lot of time in hindrances. Now, one of the things that we do then is that we begin to develop the skill of looking to see whether this thought is a hindering thought or is this thought a wholesome thought. And so this is the basic practice that most Westerners miss out on. They do things like choiceless awareness, they do things like noting techniques and many other practices that really are not what the Buddha taught. The Buddha's number one point is that the mind has to be free from the hindrances. And a lot of the sutras are about this. Sutra 19 talks about two kinds of thought. Wholesome thoughts and unwholesome thoughts. Sutta number 117, which is an exposition of the Eightfold Noble Path, talks about right effort. And what is one's right effort? One's right effort is to change our views about things from unwholesome views to wholesome views, and then we start changing the thoughts. From unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, so that we begin to have one wholesome thought after another after another. This is the way that we practice. So when you're going down the hall with your dad in the wheelchair, going down that dark hall, you're having dark thoughts, unhappy thoughts, miserable thoughts. And then something happened And you changed the way that you were thinking.

**Speaker B:** I would say that's one important thing, because I was not having dark thoughts. I only had one dark thought, which was— I was quiet and relaxed until I got to the middle of the room, and then the big wave came onto me. I mean, I feel like after all this practice, I have trained the mind not to produce the unwholesome thoughts all the time. So, I was quite relaxed. I was quite really accepting the situation and living on that moment.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's not go back to that. Let's not go, because it's in the past. Let's stay with how to practice in the present moment.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is the whole show. The whole show is to— in fact, this is how the Eightfold Noble Path is built. You have right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. Those four things together bring about right unification of mind, and with the mind completely unified and free and pure and whole, our behavior is also, and our speech is also, and our livelihood is also free and noble. So we have to get the mind free, we have to get the mind noble in a state of nobility, in a state of unity and organization. And so this is how we practice, is to get the mind free from unwholesome states. That's the first thing that has to be done.

**Speaker B:** But I have one question about this, because I feel that after practicing this, after practicing Metta for quite a while, I feel that my body or my mind or whatever, my body-mind, got used to doing Metta. And I can almost feel Metta all the time. So whenever I do, it's like it's happening before experience. It's happening before I see something or before I think something, and sometimes what would be an unwholesome thought comes to me, but I send Metta to it and it makes me happy.

**Speaker A:** Well, okay, first off, let's make some definition changes for you so that we can understand what's going on. Okay. First off, according to the teachings of the Buddha, that Metta is the outcome of correct practice, that it is not a practice. Okay, Metta is the outcome of correct practice, not a practice. All right, so what we can say, how that works, is that if we have the internal world our mind fit for the moment, then in that moment we will be operating in a state of Metta when we're dealing with the outside world. Because the correct practice, if we want to use the word Metta, which the Buddha does not— he does not use the word Metta He uses words like gladdening the mind, wholesome thoughts. Now, it's possible that you can have thoughts that you call Metta that are actually wholesome thoughts, but a lot of people will practice Metta because they've heard it with phrases like, may all beings be happy. This is a generalized kind of thing in the sense that the world is out there, way far distant from us, as opposed to the fact that the world is our immediate environment. In the West, we have an overly exaggerated, grandiose view of what we mean by reality or existence, and when we talk about universes, and our universe, we think of stars and galaxies in outer space and things that are really far away. And when we think about the world, we think about the planet Earth in the sense of people on the other side of the planet and things like that that are really, really far away. And this is a mistake when it comes to practicing Metta, because you can't learn excuse me, can't love things that are distant. And it makes no systems anyway. If you love something that's distant from here, then all you have is longing and pining for it because you don't have it because it's not here. A much better way of understanding what the world is is that which is available to you. It's your environment. It's the air you breathe and the people who walk by you and your friends and companions and business associates and priests and teachers and workers. All of these people that you come in contact with, that and only that is your world. But most of the Westerners, we have a grandiose idea of the world being really big and really are out there. All right. And so when we say then, "May all beings be happy," we're talking about it in a very, very broad, general sense that really doesn't mean anything.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But the next point about Metta is that when we are wishing other people happiness, "May all beings be happy," It's almost like trying to give someone a gift that you don't have. May all beings be happy, but I'm not happy. And so this is how Metta is practiced as a practice, and this is why only a few people have any value out of it. And even those people who have some value out of it in the moment, it's not a sustainable value. Is because it's actually based on magical thinking. A much better way of practice is the way that the Buddha teaches himself, in the sense of gladdening the mind. And any Metta thoughts that you have are just part of the gladdening of the mind, but getting the mind gladdened up is the most important first step.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so what I wanted to ask is, I may have unwholesome thoughts, but I have trained my mind to smile. So maybe an unwholesome thought comes, but I don't cling into it because my mind smiles. To the unwholesome thought. Does that make sense? I don't know where we were going

**Speaker A:** with this, but— Well, you were going in the direction of first Jhana. First Jhana. That was your question.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And the first thing that we have to do in order to get into first Jhana is to forget about wanting things. For instance, "May all beings be happy" is wanting something that doesn't exist. Metta is something that can be done when the mind is ready for it. We have to get the mind ready for it. And in this regard, I can say that Basically, the mistake that people make in general is that they don't understand the cause-effect relationship correctly. They think that what is the cause should actually be the effect. Metta is the effect of correct meditation. It's not the cause. It's not the practice that leads. Metta does not lead to Metta. Okay, correct practice of cleaning the mind leads to Metta. Metta is the result, and Metta is what we could call kindness or friendship. And so one of the first things that we need to do is learn to become friends with our own self, become friends on the inside. To stop being critical of ourselves and start to being nurturing to ourselves, start having wholesome thoughts and removing unwholesome thoughts. By having only wholesome thoughts and by removing unwholesome thoughts, now the mind can become a bit controlled. But in fact, everything about Anapanasati is learning to take control We take control of the breathing, we take control of the mind, we take control of the feelings. Then we take control of how the mind works so that we can take control of one's life. And in the process of this, we build enormous confidence. That this is not a passive meditation, yet most Westerners treat it as a passive meditation. The teacher's got to have some skin in the game. It's got to be an active control. And so if you can learn to control your breath, then you can learn to control the content of the mind. And by learning to control the contents of the mind, which would in this training is to watch the breathing, to watch the thoughts, only allow wholesome thoughts into the mind, thoughts of gladdening the mind, thoughts of this is really nice, everything is okay, everything is fine. And we need to remember to say those things over and over again. Now, these are not aspirations. Metta practice is an aspirational practice. May all beings be happy. We're wanting something that doesn't exist. This is not aspirational practice. This is the recognition of how nice things actually are in this present moment. Right now everything is okay. Right now everything is fine. All the problems of the world are either in the past or in the future, but right now everything is all right. And so the biggest teachings of the Buddha have to do with narrowing our view in the sense of from the world being outer space, universe, planets, solar systems, um, uh, that the world becomes very local. If you can't see it, it's not in your world. If you can't hear it, it's not in your world, right? This is the way to— so we close down that, that big expansive idea of the world into that which we can contact, the that which we can touch, that which has an effect upon us, and that which we can affect. So we have a much smaller view of the world. Because an example of that would be politics in another country, and you can be in Argentina and get really, really mentally involved with the politics of the United States, and yet that is so far away that it's got no effect upon you at all, other than the fact that your mind is spinning about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is what we mean, is we want to start having our thoughts more local and more real rather than way out there. So instead of saying like, may all beings be happy, we can say it in the sense of, may the people right here be happy. Well, you're right now the only one that's right here. And so we look at narrowing the focus down about what is here. The whole universe, those things like the Andromeda Galaxy, is not here, is merely nothing but a concept for almost everyone. Yeah, okay, it's not here. Also, the Andromeda Galaxy is not here right now. So we really start to focus on what's happening right here, right now, and we narrow the focus because the past is vast, the future is any dream that you want, but the reality of right now is kind of small. There's not much to it. And so, uh, this is the whole practice then, is the practice of being wholesomely right here, right now, thinking about right here, right now in a wholesome way. That's the practice.

**Speaker B:** But then if Metta is the result of practice, not the practice itself, then I feel that I can correctly describe my experience as Metta, because it's what I feel.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** It's like my mind is smiling and it's okay, even when I have to deal with difficult situations like the one I told you.

**Speaker A:** So that's an attitude change. Congratulations. Okay. That can be a skill that can be developed further.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That you're not finished with that.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** If you were completely finished it, you wouldn't have called me. No. So this is the point then, to be very careful. Instead of congratulating yourself completely for what you've already been doing, stay open to me so that I can give you the pointers and the techniques that you need to go further with it, because Sati is the main skill that needs to be developed. Sati— what does Sati mean? Sati means you got to remember. Now, in English, we have translated that word into an English language word, mindfulness, that nobody knows. Nobody has ever heard of the word mindfulness until it comes to Buddhism. And because of that, it's not a good idea for Westerners to make up new words to try to understand the teaching of the Buddha, when the original Pali word works just as well or better. That Sati actually has the quality of wake up, it has the quality of coming out of the mental sense of thought, into the sensual world of sight, touch, Hearing, the senses. The more often that we can come out of our internal world into the world of the senses. This is why we practice Anapanasati, the breathing, which helps get us in touch with the world through the body, through the body's touch and sense and deep sense systems. To literally wake up the body. But also it helps to learn to control the mind so that when you remember to take a deep breath, and take that deep breath, long, slow, deep in-breathing. That helps energize the body, and we're also paying attention and focusing on the body, which is right here, right now. The breath that we're looking at is not a breath that we had 6 months ago. It's the one we're having right now. Okay, and so all of these techniques have to do with bringing us into this present moment. Coming out of the mental systems of past and future thoughts, anxieties, worries, frustrations, desires, wanting things we don't have, having to put up with things and we want to be free from them. All of that kind of stuff is what we would consider hindrances. So that we intentionally start watching the mind thought by thought Is this a wholesome thought or is this not a wholesome thought? And as we do that, we begin to gain the skill of what kind of thoughts are wholesome and what kind of thoughts are not wholesome. That's the skill to be developed. Okay, so now we've got two skills that we're talking about. One is the skill of Sati, to wake up. To wake up and to wake up and to wake up. In fact, we want to practice this skill with the in and the out breath so that we remember to take a long, deep in-breath and remember to take a long, deep out-breath. So we're actually practicing Sati twice on each breath. Mindfully he breathes in long, which means with Sati. We breathe in long, knowing that we're breathing in long. We breathe out long, knowing that we're breathing out long. This is the important skill of developing Sati, because if we can do that with the breath, then when we have a thought, we know we're having a thought. This is Sati, to wake up and really know by seeing. So it's actually got two points to it, this mindfulness. One is Right View and the other one is Right Sati. Basically, you can say it in this phrase. Have you ever heard the expression wake up and smell the coffee? No, you've heard that, huh? Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** To wake up and to smell the coffee actually means to come out of our slumber into our sensual awareness. We can actually wake up and smell things when we're slumber, when we're sleeping. When we're walking around in the normal state of mind, then we're not awake. When we're walking around being very attentive to this present moment, then that's being awake. This is what Sati is for. And when we're awake, what we're going to do is we're going to investigate and evaluate. Think of it almost like you've heard of Sherlock Holmes before, right? You know the story of Sherlock Holmes, and he had a companion, Dr. Watson. And Dr. Watson was constantly amazed at what Sherlock Holmes was doing. And what was Sherlock Holmes doing? He was only just looking. He was investigating every little thing. Okay, so this is how we begin to do it. We're going to become a Sherlock Holmes of our own breathing and our own mind and start watching what it's doing. When we begin to watch what it's doing, we can begin then to make that choice based upon that right view of what is wholesome and what is not wholesome, so that now we take the effort to change what's in the mind from unwholesome to wholesome. An example is, and I'm sitting and I'm thinking about writing an email to some lawyer or something, and then I have it, and then I can take a deep breath and say, wait a minute, I don't feel like writing that email to that lawyer right now. I'll just sit and relax and enjoy the moment. And maybe 5 minutes later from now, I feel like I'm ready to write that email to that lawyer, and so I'll do it then because I can do it happily. Okay, so this is another way of looking at the point that we're actually making a major lifestyle change so that we only actually do the things that we want to do. And so the main job then is to get the mind into the state of liking all the time so that whatever we wind up doing, we wind up liking it. Because we're in the state of joy, we're in the state of gladdening the mind. And so we can gladden the mind over and over and over again and begin to make that the new frame of reference. Once we do that, then we can add the fourth ingredient, and that fourth ingredient is right attitude. In the Pali, it's Samma Sanghappa. And what that means is, is that we develop the attitude of a winner, the attitude of I can handle anything, the attitude of no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can throw that stuff out and come back to this present moment. Now that is in fact getting pretty close to what we're looking at here, so that if you know This is not hoping for, but this is knowledge that you know that no matter how obstructed the mind gets with hindrances, you clean it out. But this is not what most people have. Most people have the, let us say, the victim's attitude of, 'Poor me, I need help. I want this, I need that. Let me go get some help from this doctor or this nurse or this psychologist or this that priest or that guru or whatever, that in fact we're doing that exactly what we did when we were in diapers as babies. When we were in diapers as babies, we could not take care of ourselves. We needed a mommy. And so we got into the mental position, I need a mommy. And a lot of us grow up with the idea, I need a mommy, I need somebody to help me, I need a teacher, I need a guru, I need a doctor, I need a psychologist, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need. But the attitude that we're talking about, the development, is, is I don't need anything. I got everything I need. Okay, the Buddha talked about it in the sense of a lion, to become a lion, to have the attitude I can handle anything. This attitude now is actually the a major portion of the first Jhana is this right attitude gets us in the state of a sense of well-being, a sense of safety, a sense of security, a sense of confidence, a sense of comfort, a sense of satisfaction. Let me go over that little list again because we're actually now giving the definition of both spiritual power and also the definition of the word Sukkha. Now, Sukkha is exactly the opposite of the word Dukkha. When we say Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha— Dukkha, Nirodha is actually Sukkha. So we could actually call it Sukkha, Sukkha. Sukkha is the exact opposite of Dukkha, both in the Pali and also in the Thai language. And I've already heard from one student That's also true in the Gujarati language. Okay, so we can pretty well feel comfortable that the state of Sukkha that we can talk about is exactly opposite of the state of Dukkha. And so if the teaching of the Buddha is to come out of Dukkha, that means this teaching is to get into the state of Sukkha. Well, guess what? Sukkha is the factor of the first Jhana. Okay, right. Okay, so Sukkha is what we can develop once the mind is free from hindrances. When the mind is free from hindrances, we can start having then wholesome thoughts, gladdening thoughts. And basically, the kind of gladdening thoughts that we're going to have, uh, is going to help us feel better. If you have really, really unhappy thoughts, you're going to be unhappy. And if you have really happy thoughts, you'll be happy. That the mind is the forerunner. Okay, which means that all of humanity has been spending their whole lives talking themselves into feeling bad.

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And now it's time for you to talk yourself into feeling good and remembering to do that over and over and over and over again, because those old unconscious thoughts will come back up, and we need to catch them and say, nope, we're not going to have those old kinds of thoughts. We're going to have new wholesome thoughts instead. And so we begin to practice so that we can have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. And so now we're getting pretty close to the first Jhana, because once we have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought The kind of wholesome thoughts we're having are the wholesome thoughts of everything is okay, there's no dangers, I'm comfortable, I'm relaxed. Okay, and so you can actually see these aspects of Anapanasati, including step 4 of Anapanasati is relaxing the body. Step number 6 is Sukkha, to come in and be comfortable and satisfied. And when we practice that over and over again, we begin to get the exhilaration of, I can do this, yeehaw, this stuff is really nice, this is wonderful. That extra energy kick is what they call Piti in the Pali. And that Piti, actually what it means is it's Success. I've got it. That's the important quality, is, is that I can do this. And so we feel like we're kind of on top of the world because we literally are. What world are we on top in? We're on top of our own pile of dirt. It is said that everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. The question is, are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? Are you going to be sitting on top of it? Are you going to be struggling to climb out of it? Those are the three states. And the way to do it is just to pop right out and get on top of your own world, to get above your dirt.

**Speaker B:** Sitting on top of a happy pile of dirt, right?

**Speaker A:** Happily sitting on top of your pile of dirt. This is what we mean by Lokottara. The Pali word lokottara means being above the world, because we're literally on top of it as opposed to being buried underneath it. This is— we use other words like supramundane. Supramundane means just being above it all. We could also use other words that are common, like I don't care, I don't give a shit. We could use words like aloof or above it all. This is the kind of way that we begin to look at it, in the sense that we got this wired. We got no problems here. I'm above that spat. So if you hear two fellows arguing, you don't have to get in it. That's not my problem. I'm above them. And so this is the kind of attitude that we begin to develop, the attitude of being a winner, the attitude that we can handle this. And so by doing that, now we're beginning to develop the Jhana factors. Another Jhana factor is the applied and sustained thought. Well, if we're actually applying the mind to wholesome thoughts and continuing to have wholesome thoughts, then we're applying and sustaining the mind in the wholesome. This means that the mind is actually fit for work. Because we can apply it and keep it sustained in the wholesome. All right, so now we've got the Jhana factors together. We've got applied and sustained thought that's coming along with the fact that, number one, we're able to get the mind out of hindrances into wholesome thoughts. So that's the applying of the mind. Now that we've gotten the mind out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts, we gladden the mind, we cheer ourselves up We get ourselves into the present moment and we begin to feel good. That's the Sukkha. And eventually we feel really marvelous because we know we can do that. That's the Piti. And also the development of the Sati with the breathing gets the body energized, gets oxygen in there, gets the brain working correctly. And now we've got everything working correctly. This is first Jhana. We call it Samadhi only because these Jhana factors are there together. The word Samadhi does not mean concentration, and yet it is translated into English as concentration. Also, Jhanas are translated as something like immersion, absorption. These are actually completely wrong words. That what happens actually when people get absorbed, or they get immersed, they're normally immersed in hindrances. They're lost in space. But when you're in Jhana, you're alert, you're sharp, you're focused, you're capable of being in the present moment. Ain't nobody going to sneak up on you. No Zen master is going to come by and whack you with his Zen stick. Because you're not lost in space, you're not immersed, you're not absorbed, you're here now. Yes, that's what the jhanas are about, is to come into the present moment happily with all of the factors of the jhana, including being comfortable, being relaxed, being satisfied, being happy, being confident. And having only wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but let me ask you a question, because I feel that all that you're describing describes my experience when I sit, but my consciousness of the breathing may be interrupted from time to time with a thought. It doesn't last very long. It's like just 1 or 2 seconds.

**Speaker A:** I would not call it interrupted, nor would I say that it lasts a few seconds, but rather what we're practicing here will make the mind sharp so that we can see things quicker and quicker. That this is actually, you can say that Sati has 3 components to it. One is how often do we wake up? We want to practice how often we wake up by practicing the in-breath we wake up, on the out-breath we wake up. Sati on the in-breath, Sati on the out-breath. So we want to practice it often. We also want to practice it in a way that it becomes strong, in the sense that we don't just kind of halfway wake up. Up, because that's what happens with most meditators, is that they halfway wake up to see that they're in hindrances, but they don't wake up enough to have the right effort to get out of them. And so when they say things like— Goenka says that the mind has wandered away, never mind, start again. But when the students recognize that the mind wandered away Instead of starting again, they have thoughts like, oh, poor me, this is very difficult, meditation is hard to do. And all of that is just more hindrances. All right, instead we want to wake up. Never how long it's been since we woke up, we're going to wake up and say, okay, I'm awake now, got it, up now, here I am, never mind that I'm late, I'm here now. That's the way that we look at it. Okay, so being here now, waking up, and with that, now we can take the right effort. Okay, so this is what we mean is how strong our Sati is, because it's closely related to right effort. If we wake up enough, we will take the effort. If we only wake up a little bit, we'll stay in hindrance. That's the second quality of Sati. The third quality of Sati was the one that I was mentioning, and that is the third quality is that once we've got going, once we're looking and investigating, how quickly can we begin to see things happening? Because we actually want to see the process of the mind, which means we need to see the step-by-step sequence of what's happening in the mind. And so we— so Sati then is developed as the skill of how quick can we do it? So that we can get it down to the point of, let us say, about a tenth of a second, so that you can see what's happening at a very, very fast rate. This is also a skill to be developed. When we see it like that, then we stop saying that things happen together or simultaneously. We stop having thoughts like, I have breath in the foreground, but I have thoughts in the background. You probably heard people talk about that or even thought about it that way. No, what we're saying is, is that some mind moments are on breathing and some mind moments are on thought. They're not there at the same instant of time.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but can we have then mind moments on thoughts, even if they are a few, but in the first Jhana?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** First, Jhana is one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. It's applied and sustained thought applied to the wholesome, sustaining on the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but why one thought after another? Because I was dwelling on my physical sensations. Not on thinking.

**Speaker A:** Dwelling on sensations is one kind of thought.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Not all thoughts are verbal thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That in fact there are observational thoughts, and we do want to spend more and more thought moments in observational thoughts and fewer and fewer moments on thinking kinds of thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but then I'll reformulate the question. In the first Jhana, can we have verbal thoughts?

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is that's the definition of first Jhana, to have applied thoughts applied to the wholesome and sustaining those thoughts in the wholesome. Okay,

**Speaker B:** okay.

**Speaker A:** Once we have trained the mind to have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought, then we begin to train the mind to have gaps between the wholesome thoughts so that we can have more thought moments of experiential and fewer thoughts of running dialogue about it. Now the point is that if we are not practicing correctly, then some people will have experiential thought moments, but then the next thought moment will be a hindering thought, an unwholesome thought. This is the point that most Western meditators miss, and that is the very first thing of any of the practices has to do with the removal of the hindrances so that we can train the mind to have only wholesome thoughts. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. This is the basic training. You could say it in the sense that this is like learning to play the piano. You've got to learn to play chords, you've got to learn to play scales. You've got to put in the technique. You're not going to learn to play music if you can't play chords, if you can't play scales, right? That's the whole point of it. So, uh, we're not going to be able to play any life's music if we keep hitting mental sour notes. Okay, this is why we have to practice and train to start watching the mind for every thought that comes up. Is this thought wholesome or is this thought unwholesome? If it's an unwholesome thought, then we change it into a wholesome thought. If it is already a wholesome thought, then we congratulate ourselves for having already having wholesome thoughts. Okay, so life is going to be a mixture of, um, a grand life and a garbage dump. It's almost like that you've got a palace, your whole life is a palace, it just happens to be full of garbage. All we have to do is keep taking the garbage out and pretty soon we recognize that life is actually a palace. When you throw the garbage out.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but so the objective is to live in that Jhana, or not?

**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely. To practice getting oneself into the first Jhana in seclusion, and then to practice getting into that first Jhana throughout the day. Over and over and over again. And also, when we practice getting into the first jhana in seclusion, then we practice being able to get up and walk around in that first jhana. We can also do it with walking meditation. We can get ourselves into jhana in the walking meditation. All right, so that's the whole point then. Can we walk? And if we can think, hold some thoughts, then we can have conversations with people. That are wholesome. Okay. All right. And so walking around in First Jhana, to where you're in the state of Sukkha, you're in the state of joy, you're in the state of relaxation, you're in the state of, uh, the attitude of I can handle anything— isn't that a nice state to walk around in?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely. So First Jhana would be the goal. Of one's life.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** so this is the skills to be practiced in, is the skill of right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. Those four things together help build a new skill. And what is that new skill? Is the ability to get into first Jhana easily and quickly. Sometimes within one breath, and I'm out of it, and I'm right back into my good state. Okay, and then being able to sustain that, and we sustain it by being on guard. We keep watching every thought. We keep sustaining that wholesome state. We don't allow the mind to go back into hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's strange because I feel identified with what you are describing, and I feel that I have been doing that for the last couple of weeks or maybe the last couple of months. And at the same time, I feel that I may be making a mistake by thinking that I am really doing that.

**Speaker A:** I don't know if thoughts of I may be making a mistake is a hindering thought. Okay, yes, gets us into a state of confusion, doubt. One of the hindrances: am I doing it correctly? And that's just a hindrance. Okay, would you have thoughts like that saying, never mind, Never mind, start again. Never mind, come back to the breath and have only wholesome thoughts. This is why right view, Samadhi, is a skill to be developed. That's a clear example right there, is that you had doubts, but you did not recognize that as a hindrance.

**Speaker B:** But I'm feeling Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I'm feeling Sukkha. I mean, during the day I'm feeling Sukkha almost all the time.

**Speaker A:** I may be— Okay, but you still have doubts. You still have thoughts of doubt.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And while you're having thoughts of doubts, That's not very Sukkha, is it? In that particular mind moment.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way that we're looking at it, is in this moment, in this instant, are the thoughts wholesome or not? And we can be sure that they're wholesome if they're actually intending to gladden the mind. Like everything's okay, everything's fine, no worries, no problems, no place to go, nothing to do, everything is all right. These are always wholesome thoughts because they're always true, always gratifying. Well, I got nothing to do, no place to go, everything is just all right, everything is fine. No worries. Okay, so let's go practice that for a while and give me a call in a couple of days, and so we'll refine it. But this is the important thing now, as we're given the key, is that we've got to keep watching these thoughts to take them out of being unwholesome and put them into being wholesome. Okay, thoughts of well-being. Thoughts of— you don't have to use the word Metta, but what you do have is a feeling of well-being.

**Speaker B:** But how would you define the difference between wholesome and unwholesome thought?

**Speaker A:** I'm going to give you that job for you to figure that out for yourself. Okay, okay, that's your work to do.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I've already given you some hints, but you're going to have to go figure out what it is that's going to keep your mind in a really wholesome state, because you know what's wholesome and what's unwholesome. So thoughts about the past are unwholesome. Thoughts about the future are unwholesome. Thoughts about someplace else are unwholesome. Thoughts about, uh, the joy of this present moment, the thoughts of everything is okay right now, those are wholesome. For sure. Okay. But there's a whole lot of, a whole lot of thoughts in between that we can start to call junk thoughts. And the beginner think that junk thoughts are wholesome, and as they practice more and more, they begin to recognize that junk thoughts are in fact junk thoughts and they're not really worth having.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I, I, I like to have homework, so I, I Thank you for it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's your job, is to figure out what is wholesome and what is not wholesome, knowing that it's going to be a long-term process, that the more wisdom you develop over time, the sharper you'll be as to see what's wholesome and what's not wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And you always have that attitude: I'm going to have wholesome thoughts, just wholesome. Okay, so let's finish off now and, um, uh, go ahead and practice the way that you were. We'll talk about daily practice at another time. Uh, you can call back, let us say, in half a week or a week.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay, perfect.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much, Dhammarato. Thank you very much. It has been great. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. I'm glad you got something out of it.

**Speaker B:** Great, great, amazing. Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Wish you the best.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Goodbye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on the practical path to **First Jhana** by correcting common misunderstandings in Western Buddhist practice. Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis**
The path to Jhana and enlightenment is **not about passive meditation or attaining special states through desire**. It is an **active training in taking control** of the breath, mind, and feelings to cultivate a wholesome, unified mind free from hindrances.

### **Main Teachings**

1.  **The Problem with "Attainment Mindset":** The Western desire for Jhana or enlightenment is itself a form of clinging (wanting), which is suffering. True practice involves **letting go of wanting**.

2.  **First Jhana Defined:** It is fundamentally a **state of not wanting anything**, characterized by a mind free from the five hindrances, filled with wholesome thoughts, and possessing key factors: applied/sustained thought (*vitakka/vicara*), joy (*pīti*), happiness (*sukha*), and unification of mind.

3.  **The Essential Practice: Cultivating a Wholesome Mind**
    *   **Right Effort is Key:** The core practice most Westerners miss is actively **discriminating between wholesome and unwholesome thoughts** (as in MN 19 & MN 117) and replacing the unwholesome with the wholesome.
    *   **Metta is a Result, Not a Technique:** Loving-kindness (*mettā*) is the **natural outcome** of a gladdened, purified mind. Practicing it as an aspiration ("may all beings be happy") while one's own mind is unhappy is "magical thinking." The correct practice is **gladdening the mind** in the present moment.
    *   **Take Control with Ānāpānasati:** Mindfulness of breathing is a tool for **active control**—regulating the breath to regulate the mind, building confidence, and bringing you into the present.

4.  **Correcting the View: "The World" is Here and Now**
    *   Stop having a "grandiose" view of the world (galaxies, global politics). Your real world is **what is immediately present to your senses**. This narrow, present-moment focus is where practice happens.

5.  **Developing the Jhana Factors:**
    *   **Right Attitude:** Cultivate the confidence of a "lion"—"I can handle anything." Move from a needy, victim mentality to one of self-reliance and mastery.
    *   **Sukha (Happiness):** The opposite of *dukkha* (suffering). It arises when the mind is free from hindrances and filled with glad, wholesome thoughts.
    *   **Pīti (Joy):** The exhilaration of success—the "Yeehaw!" of knowing you can do this.

6.  **Jhana in Daily Life:** The goal is not just to experience Jhana on the cushion, but to **live in this state**—walking, talking, and engaging with the world from a place of joy, confidence, and wholesome thoughts.

### **Practical Instructions Given**
*   **Practice "Sati" (Mindfulness):** Remember to "wake up" on **every in-breath and out-breath**. Be like Sherlock Holmes, investigating your own mind and breath.
*   **Audit Your Thoughts:** Constantly ask: **"Is this thought wholesome or unwholesome?"** Unwholesome thoughts include those about the past/future, doubt, and wanting what you don't have. Wholesome thoughts are those that gladden the mind and acknowledge the present moment is okay.
*   **Use Gladdening Phrases:** Talk yourself into feeling good with thoughts like: *"Right now, everything is okay. I'm safe. I'm comfortable."*
*   **Homework:** The student's task is to continue investigating and refining their own understanding of what constitutes a wholesome vs. unwholesome thought in their direct experience.

### **Conclusion**
The talk demystifies Jhana, framing it as the natural, sustainable result of diligent, moment-to-moment mental hygiene. It is achieved not by seeking special states, but by **actively purifying the mind of hindrances and cultivating wholesome thoughts, right view, right effort, and a confident attitude here and now.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain the teachings:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Sherlock Holmes:** Used to describe the quality of mindful investigation (Sati). The meditator should be like Sherlock Holmes, observantly investigating their own breath and thoughts with keen attention to detail.
2.  **"Wake up and smell the coffee":** A common English idiom repurposed to explain Sati (mindfulness) as the act of coming out of mental slumber and into acute sensual awareness of the present moment.
3.  **The Lion:** Represents the "right attitude" (Samma Sankappa) of a winner—confidence, independence, and the ability to handle anything. It's contrasted with the needy, dependent attitude of a child wanting a "mommy."
4.  **Pile of Dirt / Emperor of Your Own Pile of Dirt:** Your life and mind are your "pile of dirt." The practice is about getting on top of it (in control, happy) rather than being buried under it (overwhelmed) or struggling within it.
5.  **Lokottara / Supramundane as "Being Above It All":** The state of Jhana or enlightenment is likened to being aloof, above worldly disputes and problems (e.g., "I don't give a shit" in a detached, peaceful sense).
6.  **Palace Full of Garbage:** Life is inherently a palace (a good place), but it's filled with the garbage of unwholesome thoughts. The practice is simply to take out the trash (remove hindrances) to reveal the palace.
7.  **Playing the Piano / Music:** Learning meditation is compared to learning an instrument. You must practice the basic "scales and chords" (removing hindrances, cultivating wholesome thoughts) before you can "play life's music" skillfully. "Sour notes" are unwholesome thoughts.
8.  **Giving a Gift You Don't Have:** Used to critique a common approach to Metta (loving-kindness) practice. Wishing "may all beings be happy" while you yourself are unhappy is like trying to give a gift you don't possess.
9.  **Skin in the Game:** Emphasizes that meditation (Anapanasati) is not passive but an **active control**, requiring effort and engagement from the practitioner.
10. **Narrowing the View / The Local World:** Contrasts the "grandiose" Western view of the world (galaxies, distant politics) with the real "world" for practice: your immediate, sensory environment—what you can see, touch, and affect *right now*.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Dark Hall with Dad:** Referenced from Speaker B's earlier story (not fully detailed here) about being in a difficult, emotional situation (taking a father in a wheelchair down a dark hall). Speaker A uses it as a reference point for discussing how to work with thoughts in challenging moments.
2.  **Writing an Email to a Lawyer:** A simple, relatable anecdote to illustrate applying the practice in daily life. The example shows noticing a sense of obligation or resistance, choosing to pause and gladden the mind first, and then acting from a wholesome, willing state.
3.  **Dr. Watson's Amazement:** A brief reference to the Sherlock Holmes story to underscore how the investigative power of Sati can reveal what is normally overlooked in our own mind.
4.  **The Baby in Diapers / "I need a mommy":** A story about human development used to critique a perpetual spiritual dependency. The "victim's attitude" of always seeking external help (gurus, therapists) is compared to the helpless state of an infant.

### **Core Conceptual Analogies**
*   **First Jhana = A state of "not wanting anything":** This reframes a deep meditative state as the antithesis of the attainment-oriented desire common in "Western Buddhism."
*   **Sukkha vs. Dukkha as Direct Opposites:** Presents happiness/well-being (Sukkha) not as a complex spiritual concept, but simply as the direct opposite of suffering (Dukkha), positioning it as the tangible goal of the path.
*   **Metta as Outcome, Not Practice:** Re-frames loving-kindness not as a primary technique (sending wishes) but as the **natural result** of a mind that has been cleansed of hindrances and gladdened.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to **demystify Buddhist concepts**, ground them in **everyday experience**, and challenge common misinterpretations in Western mindfulness practice. They emphasize **agency, practical effort, and immediate experience** over passive absorption or grandiose spiritual striving.
