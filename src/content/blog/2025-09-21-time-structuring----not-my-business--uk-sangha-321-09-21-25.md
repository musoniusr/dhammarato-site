### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hello friends, it's the 21st of September, 4 o'clock in the afternoon in Thailand, and today we'll cover two topics. And the first one is by request. The theme can be titled time structuring. Now the term time structuring comes actually from Eric Berne, who was a student of Freud, and that he was the one who came up with the system of psychotherapy called Transactional Analysis. And so his time structuring has to do with how people structure time socially with each other transactionally. So that's the first thing that we have to understand is that basically it's all psychology and that we could say that while Eric Byrne talks about how people structure their time in order to deal with society, The Buddha teaches how to become free from society so that we don't have to structure our time so much around it. But it's good to at least know in concept what these things are. Now, the first one on his list is called withdrawal. Now, withdrawal actually means that someone is in the group, but is not paying attention to what the group is doing, he's withdrawn. The second is ritual. Now, ritual behavior can either be informal or formal behavior. Most of the time we mean informal behavior, ritualistic. Would be like saying hi, how do you do, or the ending of a conversation. We say goodbye or we make some statement to say that it's ended. An example of that would be if we had a video call on Skype or Discord and someone lost their Wi-Fi and it cuts off. Both of the people feel incomplete because they didn't get to have that finish-up ritual of saying goodbye. It just cut. Okay, that can happen in real life when someone just gets up and walks away out of a conversation, or like on Discord, two people are having a chatting, posting conversation And then one of them just stops and leaves it without saying goodbye or anything like that. And so these rituals we have found quite useful and beneficial, kind of as starting and stopping markers, as well as more formal rituals would be like church or singing a song together. Now that's very interesting. You might think of, oh, well, I like to listen to the band. Well, when you're listening to the band, that would be more of an activity on your part. But for the band, what they're doing is they're performing a ritual. Why? Because they do the same thing over and over and over again, expecting new results, which I have heard in fact is a definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over and over again, expecting new results. And sometimes they get new results, but often they don't. So the third one would be considered a pastime. Now, some of our rituals can also be considered pastimes, but it's basically just kind of chatting. The fourth one would be considered an activity to where people are, let's say, moving lumber, building a house, cooperating on a document, working together. A quilting party then would be a combination. I don't know if any of you know what a quilting party is. That's when in the old, old days, ladies would get together bringing all their scrap cloth and that they would make a pattern and then do a quilt according to that pattern as a group activity. But while they were doing that group activity, there would still also be a lot of inconsequential dialogue that we would call a pastime. And then the next one that Bern has on his list, the fifth one, is called game playing, and he was the one who was most famous for having games that he originally considered psychological one-upmanship. Number of games would be, let's pull a fast one on Joey, or Drunk and Proud is a bar one. Another one would be playing the game of Blush. Or "I bet you can't help me," or "Yes, but." "Yes, but" is a game where somebody comes with a problem and people give him one solution to the problem after another, many of which would be adequate solutions, but he always comes up with, "Yes, but that won't work because of this, that, or the other thing," and everybody winds up feeling bad. But there's also some good games that, in fact, when Eric Byrne was going to publish his book, The author, the publisher didn't want to publish it because he had no good games in it. All he had was psychological payoff games. And so he invented the game of Busman's Holiday. So what does a busman do on his holiday? The answer, the quick answer is he rides the bus. Why? Because when he's working on being the busman, the bus driver, he doesn't get a chance to know the people. He just takes their money and says hi. He sees them he doesn't know their name. He also goes on a route, but he doesn't know the route because he's been watching the road. So when he takes the busman's holiday, he can meet the people on the bus and he can see the sights and all of that kind of stuff. Quite entertaining for him. So that would be a kind of a good game. And then the last one on Byrne's list is called intimacy. And that's when people are I know that in the West that word intimacy became a sexualized word, but it need not be. It's just when people are having friendly conversation that has, let us say, a positive outcome to it. So these are the 6 games that Byrne created, and we can see that some of them can be useful when practicing the Dharma. For instance, the withdrawal that he talks about, we would have the word viveka or seclusion. Now there's basically three kinds of seclusion. One seclusion is the body itself. We just walk away, become secluded, get on our own. The second kind of seclusion would be Citta seclusion, which would mean that we seclude the mind from the hindrances. And the third one would be Upadana, which means completely free from all of the defilements. Now we've been spending time lately on the defilements in the sense of underlying tendencies. So we talk about underlying tendencies or instinctual behavior, which is not really appropriate for modern society. Yeah, it worked pretty well 300,000 years ago, but our instincts haven't really improved very much in all of that time. And so when we become completely free from our instincts, our underlying tendencies, let us say our DNA nature, and go into the higher states of mind, then that would be being free from all the defilements. So we can also look at reading a book would be an activity, and we can read a Dharma book, or we can read a trash novel. Up to you, but both of those would be activities. Basically what we would say then is that while Eric Byrne dealt with personal interactions, that here with the teaching of the Buddha that we're actually practicing to come out of our social engagements that are instinctual Like game playing and rituals, all of those kind of things are quite instinctual. Let me give you the example, by the way. Imagine that a family is driving in the car and the dad is driving, so he's in an activity of driving. The wife is knitting, but she's also having a chat with her daughter in the back seat, and so she's doing two— she'd be doing an activity as well as a pastime. While one boy is playing a game on a cell phone and the other one is scrolling and not paying attention to what's happening in the car. So you can see there that within that group of 5, we've got most of the time structuring going on. Now, talking about it from Eric Berne's point of view is not going to be much useful for us. So that's why I've been kind of reluctant on talking about time structuring, because it's actually an ordinary thing that ordinary people do on an ordinary day all throughout their lives. So if we can take that and put it into what would be wholesome to do, One of the questions was, well, I have a lot of free time and I wind up in hindrances. That's basically just simply not paying attention. That's all there is to it. If we're paying attention and seeing that these are in fact unwholesome thoughts, the correct thing to do would take the right effort to change that. Now, one of the best things about right effort is, is that it's got a a companion that we can call zeal or enthusiasm. That if we were enthusiastic about getting rid of those hindrances and getting out of our bad moods, then the effort is fairly easy to do. And so we can actually develop zeal. I'm using zeal now as, in fact, a wholesome mental state that we could call also the winner state, that we can say, I can do it. And so we develop this zeal, this enthusiasm, this point of view that we can come out of hindrances, and that makes it fairly easy to come out of them. And so that would be Citta-viveka, coming out of the hindrances and in the mind. But there's still the underlying tendencies, there's still the instincts. But if we continue practicing, removing those hindrances over and over and over again, then the instincts begin to dry up and dry out so that we don't keep having hindrances they begin to get fewer and fewer and certainly less severe. But in fact, this is kind of the topic that we can move on to in the sense that when someone can be secluded from the mind and can be secluded from other people in their physical body, and also beginning to come out of those instinctual things. This is a state called Srotapanna. Now I have seen, and other people have talked about, there are all kinds of people out there on Reddit and whatnot that think that they're a Srotapanna. There's also a bunch of Western teachers who will go around anointing some of their students. Oh, you're a Srotapanna, or you're this, or you're that. But that's just a money-making scheme. That's like getting points for buying something, and you get brownie points for, or chips or coins or whatever, because you do what you do. But it's actually not appropriate for a teacher to tell a student that all your Srotapanna for any reason at all, and the worst reason is because the student comes up and says, "Oh, I had this experience when I was in meditation. Oh, I felt this, and oh, I felt that." Well, guess what? Experiences are cheaper than a dime a dozen. All of you right now are having an experience. I'm having an experience. Experiences are cheap. They're happening in the now all the time. The question is, Do you have any choice about what kind of experiences that you're going to have? Because in the example that I was using, that the student goes to the teacher and says, I had an experience. Basically what they're saying is, is that an experience happened to me that I had no control over, and I got a whoop-de-doo feeling about that experience, and it must mean something. And so the teacher goes with his Shaktipat and says, okay, you're certified. All of that, in fact, would be put back into the realm of what we were calling ritual. That's got no real value to it at all other than bragging rights. So let's talk about what really is then, uh, a Srotapanna, because there's suttas about it, and there's one sutta that really goes into quite a lot of detail about what it actually means. This is Sutta number 48 in the Majjhima Nikaya called the Kosambhyan Sutta. And that in this sutta, after some preliminary things, the Buddha begins to talk about what are obstructions of the mind or what are hindrances. And then he makes this statement that when the student comes to the point that they know without a doubt, they know that no matter how much hindrances there are in the mind in this moment, he can come out of it. He can come out of those hindrances and become free from them. Wake up, look at reality, and see how things really are. That in fact, hindrances are in all cases as just merely a story that we make up. Basically, you could say that it's game playing on the inside. How bad do I feel? Oh, well, I can think of something and then feel even worse. Let's see how bad a story I can tell myself and see how bad I can feel. Would be the way that hindrances— but when you can see that, when you have that zeal for practice, then that confidence— the Pali word is Saddha and the Sanskrit word is Shraddha— that confidence, that zeal that I can come out of this, and this is a skill that can be developed By how? By coming out of hindrances over and over and over again. And we can do that by gladdening the mind. Can throw out those unwholesome thoughts and bring in wholesome thoughts. In other words, we stop that game and start having a different kind of game, a wholesome game of how good can I feel. And then you talk yourself into feeling really good. In other words, by doing this, you're beginning to control the mind, and you're controlling your attitude, and also learning to control your feelings. Instead of just having any old feeling that comes up, you can actually learn to control how you feel so that you can feel the way you want to. So, Catherine, Right now, how would you feel if you could feel the way you wanted to feel? Fantastic, in a peaceful kind of way. Do you know that you just made yourself feel that way in order to describe it? It feels good. Yes, that's one thing that most people are never taught. They don't understand that we have full control over the way we feel. We have full control over the way we feel, but when we're in the habit of having really bad feelings, then we want to promote that. Then in fact, we create a view or an idea or a concept: this is just how things are. But when we have that zeal, when we have that winner's attitude, We can see that whenever a hindrance comes up, aha, I can change that. I can change it right now. I can come out of it and feel the way I want to feel. This is called the first knowledge. It is also, in this same paragraph, it's called noble. It's the first knowledge, the first step. And in fact, you could think of it as the first step of nobility, or the first step of Srotapanna, because Srotapanna, like all of the many things that the Buddha has, is having both a beginning, a middle, and an end. Or it has the path and the fruit of the path. And so this is the first step on the Noble Path. The first step is on the Noble Path, and it's got one more attribute, and that is that this is not held by ordinary people. 99 out of 100 people never think or feel, let alone at any particular time moment, that I can change, I can come out of whatever is hindering my mind and come into a state of feeling good. This is remarkable. This is the first knowledge. So let's repeat it. No matter how obstructed the mind gets, the student knows that he can come out of it and come into reality and see things the way that they actually are. This is a state that, uh, the first step of nobility This is part of the Noble Path, and this is not held by ordinary people. This is just the first step, but that is the first step. And most of the students that I have haven't made that first step yet, because there are times when, oh well, I've got hindrances and I don't know what to do about it. And you do know what to do about it. As soon as you see that there are hindrances, you stop it. You come out of it. You say, "Aha! I can see those hindrances and I can come out." Now, if one has the idea that, "Oh, I have hindrances and I shouldn't have hindrances, oh poor me," he's just redoubling and keeping those hindrances going. Keeping those obstructions of the mind in gear. But when we see the obstructions, when we can see these hindrances— aha, I see you, Mara! Haha, I see you, unwholesome thought! And by seeing it, we can come right out of it immediately. Next mind moment, right then and there, we can come out of it. This is that first step. Of the Sotapanna. So does anybody have any questions, by the way? Yeah, go ahead, Amrit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so one question is about what you said. I think a lot of time, for instance, like in Goenka retreats, they tell us to observe whatever is happening. So if you're feeling bad, then just observe it. But I think learning from you, what I understand is actually feeling bad is something we are creating. Right, it's a mental activity, right? And.

**Speaker A:** I could go off on a long tirade about the word Vipassana in this case, because the word Vipassana, by the way, does not appear hardly ever in the suttas. But the word Anapanasati in the sense of a verb, means actually clear seeing. And in the part about the clear seeing is to see clearly that it can be changed. But insight meditation is just seeing how dirty it is without doing any change. So they're not actually practicing what the Buddha taught. Vipassana meditation practitioners are not going to get very far. The only Sotapanna that they'll ever see is that when their teacher bestows it in a ritual for them. But they're still ordinary people because they haven't come to that point of seeing that no matter how obstructed the mind is, I can change it and I can come out of that. So you can say then that the teachings of the Buddha is a change model. And Goenka's model is not a change model. The Western meditation teachers, their insight meditation, the Vipassana meditation, the noting methods are not change models because they leave out that important point of the right noble effort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just was watching an interview of Goldstein. I forgot his name, the first name. I think he's one of the founders of— Joseph Goldstein. Yeah, he was talking about mindfulness. So he— and it was interesting actually. He— because I think what you are doing is you have 3 things: you have Sati, to remember, to look, afterward investigate and then to make an effort to change. And I think what he did, he used the word mindfulness and he overloaded it with many terms. He said, okay, mindfulness is looking, but also it means non-judgmental. And he was also saying that it should be free from craving and aversion. And I think this is a bit of a confusion, right? Because when I was doing like Bhante's method, I was always thinking, this is mindfulness, this is not mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** All right, and it's the major problem with what we would call Western meditation, especially those that talk about having retreats. The Buddha never had— there was no retreats in the time of the Buddha ever. In fact, the first retreat that I know of happened in the 1950s, and they were, uh, for lay people in Burma. That's where this tradition got started with Upekkha, and Goenka was a student of his. And that they say that this is what laymen should do because they are not up to making the change the way that monks should be able to make a change. That's not true. Anybody can practice. In fact, the students of the Buddha, who were laymen, and he had more lay followers than monastics, and that he also taught them the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. Go ahead, Agnes.

**Speaker C:** Thank you. I have a comment or whatever. For me, I think it has been a lot about seeing how stupid I have been. And that's been quite a humbling, or lack of a better word, experience. Then it really came to me, oh my God, what am I doing, kind of. And there's a liberation in that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, with the also accompanied thought of Anagami, I have to get out of this. I've got to get out of this.

**Speaker D:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Just like you were talking about it one time, that in the alcohol you finally came to the point, I've got to get out of this.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's what I mean by the zeal. That's that when we have that attitude, I've got to get out of this shit.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I don't have to Yeah, I don't have to do it anymore. It's like, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it did its job.

**Speaker C:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so now, a more gentle right effort, almost energetic. See, in the beginning, right effort often is not enough. And in fact, we put a lot of ego in it. But when we bring this zeal, this attitude of I've got to get out of this, That's what then gets the right effort working. And so when we begin to see these hindrances that put us into a bad mood, we've got to get out of those. Then that means that we can now start taking the right effort right then and there to get out of that feeling, to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind, to change our attitude. Okay, so this is the first step of Srotapanna. Let's talk about the others. The second step of Srotapanna actually has the word Samatha. This is the first place and one of the most important places where Samatha is actually used in the suttas, to where Vipassana is quite rare. Hardly ever mentioned. Now the important point would be that Samatha and Vipassana are the same thing, and they work together. Let us say that the example would be taking a photograph. All right, if you've got a camera in your hand and you're waving your hand around with that camera, is that camera going to get a good shot? Are you needing to hold your hand still? Or better still, put the, uh, the, uh, camera on a tripod to steady the camera. Then will the camera take a good, uh, shot. What do you think, Catherine? You wait. Waving a camera in the air is going to take a good shot? Not a chance. All right, so this is what we mean by Samatha, is that we can steady the mind down, which means that once we've gotten the hindrances out of the mind and we can see things clearly, we can stabilize the mind. Applied and sustain the mind means that we get it stable, and when the mind is stable, it can see the hindrances a whole lot better. When they do come up so that you can say, aha, I see you, and then don't get stuck into them. So in some ways you could say this is a gradual process because we have to build both Vipassana and Samatha together. But really it's not. It's really an attitude. If you have the attitude that you can come out of this no matter what the obstruction is, I can come out of it. That's that zeal. And that in many cases, it can also be stated, I've got to get out of this. I can get out of it, I've got to get out of it. And that zeal then brings us to the point of being able to get out of it long enough to steady the mind so that we can see things the way that they really are. Now, the third knowledge is, after we practice this quite a lot, we begin to see that this method that the Buddha has, this Eightfold Noble Method, especially the first parts of it, of remembering to look and then to change— remember to look, to change— and that brings up that zeal —so that we have remembered to look, to change, and to congratulate ourselves: "Wow, I can do that." This brings about the unification of mind. And when the mind is unified, in those moments when the mind is unified, the mind is free from defilements. It doesn't have underlying tendencies bubbling up. So once we can do this often, we begin to say, I've got the path. Without a doubt, I know what I should be doing moment by moment from this moment forward into the rest of my life. This is my life's plan of be here now happily. And we also come out of the doubt of what is not the path. So we know now the third knowledge is what is and what is not the path. Basically, what this actually means is that we're changing our old views. As I said before, we have underlying tendencies to hold views, and most of the views that we hold we got in childhood, and we picked them up from people who didn't have a very good attitude about life. They had their own viewpoint. Like politics stinks and so does the garbage. So we go around thinking that everything stinks because everything is garbage and everything is politics. And so these are the attitudes that we get, and we can change that attitude. And now the new attitude is, no matter what happens, I can clean up my mind, followed then by the new attitude of I know what my plan is now. I know what the path is. No matter— I've got it without a doubt. This is how we do it. We apply the Eightfold Noble Path over and over and over again, and every time we do, we come out of those hindrances, those underlying tendencies. So this is the third knowledge that is noble. It is a step on the path, and it's not held at all by ordinary people. Almost no one has this winner's attitude that they know what to do. Almost all the people that you want are still looking for help someplace. They need help from a doctor, they need help from a psychologist, they need help from some guru, some teacher. But when we come to this step of I know what I need, and I need to follow the Eightfold Noble Path right now. So the fourth— does anybody have any questions about that? All right, so the fourth knowledge, the fourth knowledge actually has, um, uh, a little story. About the ceremony or the ritual of Paddy Mokkh, where each individual monk, especially the younger ones— the older ones have already done it amongst themselves— but when they go into Paddy Mokkh, the elder monks are sitting at the door and the young monks come up with a ritualized way of confessing of getting it off our chest. Whatever I've done wrong, I get it out. Now, this actually has a better usage for it in the sense that when you can see that hindrance, when you can see I've got to get out of it instead of, oh, poor me, I feel so bad, I wish I could feel better. Into actually seeing, aha, I see that and I can change it. That, that's what really the confession is for in the Paticcasamuppada. It's to rid yourself of those things that you have done, the inappropriate behavior. We can see that, make it public, and get rid of it so that we don't have to confess the same stupid things over and over again like the Catholics do. Got a joke about that, and that is, is that the young guy left the bar and went down to the confessional booth and confessed to the priest, oh, I've been a bad boy with all the ladies in town. And the priest, he started prodding and prodding, he says, wait a minute, who? And the guy says, oh, I couldn't possibly say who it was. And so then the priest says, well, is it Susie down on Fifth Avenue? And he said, no, wasn't her. And then he says, well, was it Maryland on Sixth Avenue? And he says, no, it wasn't. And was it Jane on Seventh Avenue? And he says, no, it wasn't any of them. And he says, well, who was it? And the guy says, I can't tell you, priest. And the priest got angry and stopped the confessional. And so he went back to the bar, and there his friend says, how did your confessional go? And he says, I'm not sure about how the confessional went, but I've got 3 new leads. All right, so what kind of confession is that? A real confession. Pardon? Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** He's getting closer.

**Speaker A:** I hear you, Red. Go ahead and talk.

**Speaker E:** No, it's just about the joke.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** He's getting closer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, he got 3 new leads, which means he didn't use a confession correctly at all. When we, when we confess things, when we get it off our chest, even if you don't tell another person but you can see for yourself that what you've done was harmful, not appropriate, then you can confess that in the sense of I I've got to stop doing that. I can't do that anymore. So that's the fourth knowledge. The fourth knowledge is when we can see our wrongdoing happily, so that we can put a stop to it. The fifth knowledge is the knowledge— the story goes is when the monk, the young monk is in the wat, sweeping and doing his activities, he's still got his mind on the Dharma. He's thinking about the Four Noble Truths. He's thinking about the Eightfold Noble Path. He's thinking about what's in his mind, but his hands are actually doing sweeping. So that means that we begin to spend more and more time thinking about the Dharma. We spend more and more time looking at what we're doing. Our time structuring changes from just doing any old thing into doing that which would be wholesome by keeping track of the Dharma. Now, there's another example that's used in this same sutta, and that is the sutta phrase about the mother cow who has just calved, and that though she's eating grass and doing what cows do, She's keeping one eye on that cap. So the way that we could think of it is no matter what you're doing, no matter what activity you're doing, keep an eye on the Dhamma. That's especially true when you're on our Discord group. Keep an eye on the Dhamma. Don't just post any old thing. Post Dhamma. All right, so the sixth one actually comes back to that first one about zeal. And now we're changing it into eagerness or enthusiasm. When you become completely enthusiastic about the Dharma, because you've got it on your mind all the time and you're really enthusiastic, you want to hear the Dhamma, you want to read the Dhamma, you want to discuss the Dhamma, you want to recite the Dharma. You want to read it over and over and over again, like a little ritual, but you've got enthusiasm for the Dharma. That's the sixth knowledge. The seventh knowledge is the big one though, the big whoop-de-doo, and that is that one becomes delighted with the Dharma. Wow, there is nothing really else. I mean, this is it. I've got it now. Okay, so you can see these 7 knowledges kind of work together. But once someone has that full knowledge of what is and what is not the path, they forgive themselves and stop doing their disgusting behavior. They've got their mind on the Dharma all the time. They're enthusiastic about the Dharma and they're delighted because they're free. This is the state of Srotapanna. This is the full fruit of Srotapanna and is all under the realm of what you would call knowledge. You know that this is what it is. We don't have full control 100% yet of the underlying tendencies, especially the underlying tendency to ill will or the underlying tendency to greed, but we have a really, really good handle on the underlying tendency to views, because now we've got the view of "I can do this." So this is what a Srotapanna is. Now, one of the things that's quite interesting is that even though there are four groups— the Srotapanna, the Srotagami, the Anagami, and the Arhat— Those two middle ones are, let us say, later introductions with a whole lot of magical things around them. That in the suttas they only talk about the two steps, which would be the beginner is just a beginner getting started. But that major milestone of being in the middle is when you are Srotapanna. And that Srotapanna has the quality of being immersed in the Dharma. That actually you can think of the stream is that now that you've entered the stream, I mean, most people will put in a toe into the stream to check its temperature. Then they may wade out into it. But the full Srotapanna is laying on his back in the middle of the stream. Floating down the stream, maybe with a spout of water coming out of his mouth, and just enjoying the heck out of life. That's what the story of the Srotapanna is, okay? That's it. And the only next step that there really is is the state of Arahant, which means that the Srotapanna still has the work of getting rid of some of these old underlying tendencies. The underlying tendency of Panna, of saying 'I am'— the underlying tendency of doubt, though, is basically eradicated. The underlying tendency of views is eradicated so that we have the view— if we have a personality view, by the way, If we're looking at that first letter, the personality view turns from 'this is who I am' into 'I'm a moving target.' I don't know who the heck I am. An example would be write down all of the attributes, take as much pencil and paper and take as much time as you need to write down who you are. And then one month later, go back and do that same thing again, no matter how much paper or pencil it takes. Write down everything about you and who you are, guess what? It's going to be a different list. You're not fixed. There is no personality. That's the view. The view is, is that you're not a fixed personality. Now Christianity, they want to make sure you understand that you are a fixed personality. They have— you've got an original sin. You got to play it safer. You got to chew the wine and drink the wafer or something like that. No, chew the wine, drink the wine and chew the wafer. And by doing that, you're actually saying that I can't do it on my own. But this Srotapanna point, this delightful place is, yeah, I can do it. I am doing it. Whoop-de-doo, we've got it. So that's the state of the Sotapanna. And so when these underlying tendencies then come up, he can say, aha, I've got you. And when the underlying tendencies don't come up much anymore, that means that they've died away. They're not there. The example that I'll use here is imagine that you've got a weed like a dandelion that's growing up in the cracks of the sidewalk. You can't pull that dandelion up. You don't want to destroy the sidewalk. The city government will be unhappy if you tear up their sidewalk just to get rid of a dandelion. But what you can do is every time you see that dandelion putting up a shoot, putting up a leaf, you can whack it off. And you whack it off again. And every time it comes up, you're there. I see you, and you grab it and pull it out. What's going to happen to that root of the dandelion if you whack it off every time it grows? Every time it comes up to the surface, you whack it off. What's going to happen to that root? Catherine, I'll ask you again. What, what do you think is going to happen to that root of that dandelion if you keep whacking it off? I mean, it's going to wither and die away. And if you keep pulling it out, you'll get rid of it. And so that's what we mean then, is by we're going to keep pulling those dandelions out of the mind by whatever we can grab hold of happily. We're already in a state of happiness. Nothing's going to bother my happiness now. But the hindrances in the, um, uh, uh, kilesa, the underlying tendencies, do come up. But when they do, I can see that and I can pull that darn thing out, and then it dies away. And when they're all dead and gone, that's what the Arahant has, which means he keeps looking for dandelions. He doesn't ever see any, but he keeps looking. Not finding a dandelion there anywhere. So Paul, does this answer your question?

**Speaker D:** Yes, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so nobody's going to confer— nobody's going to confer Sotapanna on you. It's something that you know because it grows out of you. You know what the path is. You know that you're already okay. Yeah, there's things that happen, but you can forgive those things and pull them up and let them go. But most importantly is that we become eager for the Dhamma. We become delighted in the Dhamma so that nothing else is worth knowing but the Dhamma. So back to the beginning of it, we could say then that Eric Byrne's time structuring really has not much value for us anymore, because the way that we structure our time is always in happiness, and we tell the truth, even though sometimes the people get offended when they hear the truth. It's all right, we're going to say the truth, we're going to say what's real, reality. Is where we're coming from. So Karwan, do you have something to say?

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato, good talk. Good talk, thank you. Not much to say. Well, I have actually some things to say, but I think better I give the time to others for now. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What? I didn't catch that. Ah, Mikey, can you help me? What'd he say?

**Speaker F:** Can you hear me right now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you, but don't talk too fast. Old ears don't hear good.

**Speaker F:** Oh, so yeah. Oh well, thank you. Nice, nice talk. Like, uh, Always. Well, I have something to say, but I'm not sure if it is very related to this talk. So I better maybe chat in the group chat instead of here. So I'll give the time to someone else who has something else to say.

**Speaker A:** Well, now you've whetted our appetite and you won't serve us the meal.

**Speaker F:** Well, okay, my question is, I will just ask you whether if you're Time to answer it, answer it, otherwise other time. My thing is, I care too much. I found out actually basically that I just care too much. I give too much of them to, and how do I stop caring so much?

**Speaker A:** How do you stop clinging so much?

**Speaker F:** Caring, I care too much. Anicca. Yeah, I care too much. I care too much about what I think is truth. What I think is truth. And I still—.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? Being right doesn't help anybody. Every argument— and there's been hundreds of millions of arguments in the past several hundred years— and every one of those arguments is held by two people, both of whom think that they're right. Is that not correct?

**Speaker F:** That's correct, but still, I think it's good that some things are still in others, and that still— otherwise, you know, so I should just have no opinion and nothing and just shut my mouth and accept everything else?

**Speaker A:** Not have an opinion. As I've said before, I don't believe in beliefs. I don't have opinions. I have observations, and sometimes the observations are different than other people's observations, and that's okay. Perhaps one of us has clear seeing and the other one doesn't, but there's no reason to argue with that. So the important thing is don't cling to views. Don't cling to, I have a viewpoint, I think I'm right. When you see yourself doing that, you can say, aha, I see that too, because that's a view. Yeah, that's actually— it winds up, as you can tell over and over again, I've seen you be able to tell that when you hold views, they hurt. Views are like a hot potato. They burn when you're holding views. They burn when you get into arguments with people.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, so yeah, I feel that.

**Speaker A:** Say that there's love. Yeah, so there's levels of truth, you're right, which means that there's different observations. The problem with views, the problem with views is that they're always old views and not new views. They're not new viewing, they're old views. And so we can begin to say, all right, I'm not going to hold old views anymore. Let's have some new views based upon viewing. Let's look, but don't come to a conclusion because that conclusion is going to change by the time you get it fully recorded in the mind. I know this, and then it changes. Just like I said, you're a moving target, so is reality. That comes under the, uh, the statement the Buddha made of Anicca, what the Sankhara— everything is changing. And if, and if we can watch it change, we'll be happy. If we say, oh, I've got this view that it should not be that way, that it changed that way, I don't like it, Now you're harming yourself. So this would be a new practice for you, is to look at the views that you hold. So that you stop having those views. That would be an easy way to do it, is, "Aha, I see I've got another view." I have the view that those monks bow and scrape, and I don't like them bowing and scraping.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, you know, I feel like if I truly give up all the views that I have, like I would, like I would lose all control that I have on life like that.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** And?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that feels— I don't see any disadvantage yet.

**Speaker F:** Well, that feels scary.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you give up all of your views, that means that in a new particular situation you can now observe directly so that you can be in control based upon new information, that in fact those old views were not allowing you to be in control. Because you were holding old views in a new situation. So give up on views.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, um, I will practice being more aware of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and let him— yeah, practice on looking at those views. Grab hold of that view and yank it right out. It's just an underlying tendency. It's just an old habit. An old instinct. Actually, I'll make this point about it, is that how is it instinctual? It's instinctual, probably you've heard about the territorial instinct. Well, now a dog has a territory, a chicken will have a physical territory, their pecking place. Dogs have a territory and they go and they mark it with urine and whatnot. But humans have evolved a bit. We don't hold territory like so much anymore. Our territory is more mental. Our territory is the views that we hold. Our territory is like, I'm a member of this party or that party, I'm a member of this religion or that religion, I'm a member of this group or that group. Any of those kind of 'I'm a member of' or I identify with, that's just an old view. There have been people, let us say, that have been voting for the Republican Party for the past 50 years, and the Republican Party that they started voting for and had been voting for for years doesn't exist anymore. It's only the name. And so they'll vote for the name without even recognizing that the party that I want to vote for doesn't exist. They're just holding a view. So in that regard, are they actually in control? Not a chance. Not a chance are they in control, because what they think is there changed years ago and is constantly changing even now. Not the same as it used to be. So let's make a thorough investigation of what is, and then another investigation, because what it was when you observed it a moment ago, it's already changed. Things are moving pretty fast. So let's not cling to views, let's not hold opinions, let's not believe things. Let's observe, analyze, check it out.

**Speaker F:** And that part is really difficult for me because I still do believe that there are things like truths, and some things are like obviously better than other things. And, and that makes it then for me very difficult to basically distance from that, or just say, okay, everything is basically relative, all the opinions are relative, and everyone is right, or Today is right and tomorrow wrong, or vice versa.

**Speaker A:** And— I know, but that was part of the training that you went through. And Truth is a moving target.

**Speaker D:** Can I speak on that?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker D:** Can I speak on that?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go right ahead.

**Speaker D:** Well, one thing that's being trained is like, habits of mind. And so if Karuna is developing one habit of mind versus another, and the habit of mind that you're speaking about, let's say, is the Dhamma. So perhaps Karuna can trust that his habits of mind that he's developed will guide his perception of reality. So when he speaks, although it need not be a preformed opinion, it's more likely to be in line with something very important to him, which let's say would be Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a good point, and I'll rephrase it in the sense that, Karuna, the only thing that's important enough to really investigate is the Dhamma, and all of your views and opinions about what's right and wrong It's just old crap that you carry around and you stab yourself with it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S like a hot potato. Or another way of thinking about it, it's mud. If you're— if you've got a mud ball out there, a true mud ball, it's really a real true mud ball. If you're going to throw that mud ball at somebody, you're probably in the process of throwing it, you're going to get muddy.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And I say one more thing, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Okay. So another thing is perhaps the view is I must speak on this subject to this person or even to myself now versus not having the need to speak on it necessarily. Like that there's a context, there'll be a time to speak on it and kind of, yeah, put the observation out there. But maybe there's other times where you can enjoy freedom from an argument by not having the need to speak it out.

**Speaker A:** That's right. We don't have to. So, and so that would be a view. The view is I've got to say something about this. No, you don't. And you say, well, if I don't say anything about it, nothing's going to change. Well, you're not sure of that. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. Maybe if you say something, it's going to get even stuck deeper than it was. But if you don't say anything at all, that person will reflect and begin to see and begin to change.

**Speaker F:** That's actually the part where I started. I care too much. You see, I care too much. That's why I feel like if I truly did not give a fuck, I would just shut my mouth. But when I see something which is wrong, and I see many wrongness happening in the world, and I feel if I shut my mouth, I'm not doing any favor to anyone.— and not doing.

**Speaker A:** A favor to yourself. And not only that, but when you open your mouth and blab to other people, you're not doing them any favor. But if you keep quiet, you might be doing them a.

**Speaker D:** Favor. So you don't— I got one more thing.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead. I like this.

**Speaker D:** Okay, okay. Well, despite, uh, recommendation of only reading certain books. Someone did read Seeing with the Eye of Dhamma, translated by Bhante Karuna of Buddhadasa. And one thing, one point that's kind of strong that was made is clinging to the good is a difficult item for people. People may easily recognize don't cling to the evil, but that clinging to the good brings— I mean, in the book it speaks of like kind of neurotic, obsessive, and actually a lot of bad. And I've thought recently about some conflicts in the world at this moment, and probably the aggressors feel very strongly that they're acting for good reasons, that for God's reason or for God and country's reason, let us go to war. And they're literally clinging so strongly to the good that they're going to war over it, that actually there's something— although this is quite, let's say, controversial— there's something less neurotic about being cool, sorry, with evil. But that's not the path of the Buddha. The path of the Buddha is, let's try to not cling to the evil, but be careful about clinging to the good, be okay with things as they are, and that this is actually a more peaceful route. You're less likely to have to go to war either verbally or with guns, bombs, and lots of misery, if it's not so important to insist, "Oh no, no, this is correct, this is good, this is important, I shall make sure everybody knows it, me, other people," whether it takes like a verbal altercation or basically horrible, horrible wars, let's.

**Speaker F:** Say.

**Speaker A:** There are many, many, many examples of what you're talking about. Let me give you a few. One would be Putin had the view that unification of Ukraine with Russia would be good, and so he starts a war. The Republicans said, oh, we need to lower the food cost. And so they voted for Donald Trump, and look what they got. So clinging to the good actually is just another clinging. And when we cling to it, we call it good, but it's actually ignorant. We don't know whether that's good or not. Go ahead.

**Speaker F:** I think there is some— there is something into that, into that I cling to the good. But I do also think that in Sometimes, a few times in the group I have said the word Hitler and it triggers some people, but I seriously say that because I want to make a point. And my point was also this, again, of that. When Second World War happened, the time of Hitler, if everyone was just like, okay, yeah, you know, we are not clinging to any good, so let's that monster do whatever he want to do, we will just do nothing.

**Speaker A:** Well, the point though is, is that there was a lot of people in Germany who supported him, listened to his lies, and thought that he was good. If he had no supporters, he would have never come to.

**Speaker F:** Power. Those are good points.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so you can't say, oh, well, after Hitler's gone too far, now we have to do something about it, that in fact it would possibly have been the case that the United States never got into the war, and that Hitler's regime fell apart. I mean, look at the fact that he was both in Russia and in France, and they got his tail whipped in Russia. In fact, General Winter beat his tail. And then in France, there was an underground that was really, really valuable. In fact, the Allies probably wouldn't have been able to beat Hitler without the underground in France. So, we can't say, "This is right and that is wrong." We just can't. We don't know what the future's going to.

**Speaker D:** Be.

**Speaker A:** The question is, can you shut your mouth and be happy? And when you are happy, then you can share. You have a lot to share when you're.

**Speaker D:** Happy.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, there's a song by Scatman John. There's a song by Scatman John that I like to say that he knew some of the Dharma probably. In his songs you can see, let it go because there's nothing else. And one of the songs is Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Mind. That's the name of the.

**Speaker A:** Song. So that would be the way that you could see for yourself, Karwan, is how do you feel when you're about to print or type something? If you're trying to correct someone else's mistake, stop. And create and correct the mistake that you are making of feeling bad about somebody else's bad behavior. And when you begin to feel good again, then you can post something that may be useful, beneficial, and wholesome for that person. But if you post out of your view, then you're probably not going to do anything other than create an argument.

**Speaker D:** There's also something called Sila. There's also something called Sila. And if World War II, say it just that the Americans were moved to intervene, but then look at the Cold War after, and the spies and the interventions in South America and Vietnam, all the way echoing through. All of that was in the name of first anti-Nazi and now anti-communism. Well, that doesn't all follow. So perhaps if there was, you know, wiser action on the part of governments, let's end this horrible war. And okay, like, you know, maybe that was wise action, perhaps. But then look at all the things that continued because of well-developed viewpoints that are further and further away from protecting individuals who are being grievously harmed by.

**Speaker A:** Others. That's an important point, but we can go a little bit further to recognize there have always been wars. Around the turn of the century, 1899, Spain and America, but there were other wars going on at that time. And then there was hardly nothing happening other than war until it got big enough to be World War I. But when World War I was over, it wasn't over. And so it went into the '30s, and then, you know, it's all— so it's always— you're always going to have people, Karwan, who have attitudes about they know what's right. And so we can't use the world as a good example. Because there's always wars and rumors of wars and bad behavior and whatnot. And almost all the behavior, all that bad behavior has been done by politicians. Every one of them thought that they were right. Every one of them. Hitler thought he was right. Yep. Okay, so don't— when you get to the point of saying I'm right about this, that's the time to recognize it's time to shut up. I'm not sure. You've heard me say that many times. Stay with that phrase, not sure, because we have that underlying tendency. We have it as an instinct, as part of our DNA nature, to think that we are right. We hold views, we hold opinions, and the antidote for that is that little phrase, I don't know, not sure. 'Let's take a moment, let's reinvestigate, and then investigate again because we're still not sure.' And you keep with that. You stay with 'I'm not sure.'.

**Speaker D:** They're both— also, Karuna's not the government. Karuna's not the government. He's practicing the Dhamma. So the governments do one thing, but the monks do another. I mean, what are monks doing? That's the whole thing, is to away from society. We do things a little differently here because we're on some other kind of mission because the governments are going to be doing their intervention, which is a difficult thing, which is because it may— I don't know if it's moral or not. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. You know, I don't know. But it's just doing something different than what other people are doing.

**Speaker A:** So in other words, you can say that I'm on a mission and my mission is to stop my mission. I'm going to stop having missions. Just enjoy it. It's great all by itself. No need for any.

**Speaker F:** Missions. Yeah, that's a nice one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure. Just change the mission to no mission at all. Nothing to do, no place to go. The grass grows by itself. So this is the teaching of the Buddha. However, I can understand, Karwan, because of your past, that you were trained to hold views about what is right and what is wrong. In fact, that's the major part of a problem with religions, is all religions have very, very strong views about their being.

**Speaker E:** Right.

**Speaker A:** How could they all be right when they're all contradicting with each other? And how could any of them be right when they're always fighting with each other?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's also— go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Also sometimes much more difficult to look at oneself than at the world and others. It's easier to.

**Speaker D:** Blame.

**Speaker C:** And instead of seeing, what am I doing, what am I thinking, how is it with me, and to change that. One cannot change the world, one can change oneself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Hitler tried to change the world, make it like he thought it should be, and he wasn't very good at that. Putin's doing the same thing, Donald Trump's doing the same thing, Biden tried the same thing. All the politicians are trying to fix the world. According to their own belief. Yeah, thinking that they know what's good. And guess what? There's what, 330, 40 million? A bit, yeah, 340 million people in the United States, and every one of them except for two of our friends are holding views that they know how the world should be. Every redneck in Georgia knows exactly what the government should do, every one of them, and they'll fight with each other over it. And every redneck in Texas will fight with every redneck in Georgia over how things should be. That's clinging to views. It's part of our nature to hold views. Actually, there's a reason why we do that. And why is that? Is because we are uncomfortable being in doubt. Doubt creates danger. What if there— what if— what if Hitler comes? You know, so let's, uh, work with this in the sense that having a view or a doubt or an idea about how things are going to be is not going to eradicate the doubt. The only thing that's going to eradicate the doubt in your mind is your own attitude that you can be happy, no matter what all those attitudes are. And when you have that attitude that, hey, I'm all right, I can do it all by myself, I in fact I am doing it and I'm doing a really bang-up job of it, when you have that attitude, then who cares what the world is.

**Speaker C:** Doing?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I totally understand it, but still I have difficulty with it. But I will practice, of course, Anagami, Anapanasati, become.

**Speaker A:** More clear.

**Speaker F:** Yes, right. For me, it's like if I truly understand this, maybe it does just because intellectual, then I really feel like egoistic if I train If I think in those terms. Yeah. Like, am I egoistic? If I just close my— if I just truly close myself from society and be in my small world, then I can see myself being happy. But that feels somewhere it does not.

**Speaker A:** Feel right with me.

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato, just add the great doubt to the mix. From the.

**Speaker F:** Zen.

**Speaker B:** Why does it have to be right?

**Speaker C:** It doesn't have to feel.

**Speaker A:** Right. You haven't done it, Red, so you don't know how it's going to feel. It just— you have the opinion that it's not right. So begin to take the opinion of, wow, what a relief it is. That's not my business. It's not my problem. It's not my business. The world out there, I can't fix it.

**Speaker F:** Too many things my business and my problems, which are in actuality maybe not my problems.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So you own things that don't belong to you when you have the opinion that you know how things are going to be. In a way, you're a thief. Because you're taking away the attitudes and the ideas and the viewpoints of other people and say, no, I'm right and you're.

**Speaker G:** Wrong.

**Speaker A:** I'll let them to have their opinions happily, and you don't have to hold opinions. Let them have their own business. Not my business, not my problem. Or as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would say, nothing is worth clinging to as mine. Is I, me, or mine? Nothing is worth clinging to. That's not my business. Hitler is not my business. Putin's not my business. Ukraine, not my business. The Polish border has just been closed, that's not my business. China hates that they closed the border because they can't put their trains of goodies into Poland and Europe, and that's not my business. Isn't that marvelous? It's not my business, I don't have to fix it. Well, if it were my business, how would I get that train through that border? Become an engineer, took my whistle and rev that engine and run right through that barrier and get it all blown up by somebody who thinks that they've got the business of shooting the train that's running through the border. And so that's the way of looking at it, Karwan. As much of the stuff that you have opinions about are really not your business anyway.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Is one function of the Buddha Sangha, if that's what it's called, kind of to show an example that such an attitude is possible in the world? It's possible to not have to intervene. It's possible to not have to go to war over views. I don't argue about it, but I show it by one's dedication to this path, let's say. I wonder if that's one function of the Sangha, the Noble Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Yes, actually, the Sangha gives that beautiful, let us say, example that we don't have to do it. We don't have to get.

**Speaker D:** Involved.

**Speaker A:** We don't have to do anything. Thai politics, not my business. In fact, that's one of the best things about living in Thailand, is I don't even know the native language, so I don't get much out of the news. Thai news means nothing to me. I'm not following who's the who's in what party, or who's the prime minister. None of that's my business. But because I'm not in the United States, it's easy to see that's not my business. Well, here you are in Thailand. Why can't you see that the stuff that— you come from an Islamic civilization. Nothing in Islam is your business. Nothing. You've already left. You walked out on them. So why do you turn around and point fingers at them? When you could just chill, just relax. It's not your business. Islam is not your business. Christianity is not my.

**Speaker F:** Business.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Wow, what a relief it is. That's such a relief. That is not my.

**Speaker F:** Business.

**Speaker A:** So, Caroline, it's early for you. What do you think? Is it your.

**Speaker B:** Business?

**Speaker A:** Do you mean me? Yes.

**Speaker D:** Christine, Christine, Christine, not Caroline.

**Speaker A:** I've been called worse. It's all good. No, no, nothing to say. Just good. I really appreciate. Good talk. Not my business. Mr. Ben, what you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** So thank you, Dhammarato. Not much to say. So it's not your business.

**Speaker D:** Huh? Definitely.

**Speaker A:** Not. How about you, Paul? What do you.

**Speaker D:** Think?

**Speaker A:** Good talk. Not my business. And the only thing we can handle is what is coming through the senses, 6 senses right now.

**Speaker D:** And that makes it easier instead of.

**Speaker A:** A whole big world. To.

**Speaker D:** Handle.

**Speaker A:** All right, how about you, Red? What do you have to.

**Speaker E:** Say? Despite being none of my business, I observe that maybe Karuna will like the music I post on the chat. I may be wrong, and it's fine. There's nothing special in it. It's just— we're just celebrating whatever. Because we do the wholesome, whatever else. Well, like, there was me and Kuesti, we actually just, we had a meditation place for almost, for basically a year. It was like 2 days ago. And yes, the laymen go and they get the benefits immediately.

**Speaker A:** What else?

**Speaker F:** But.

**Speaker A:** That'S not important. Go ahead. It's fine.

**Speaker E:** No, that's fine. It's fine. No problem. Not my business. No. What.

**Speaker A:** Else? So Krishna, do you have something to say? How about you, Ioannis? Much of this talk was for.

**Speaker F:** You. Yeah, I appreciate the talk about time structure.

**Speaker A:** I guess like right now we are.

**Speaker D:** Doing the ritual to close the call.

**Speaker F:** Like a ritual of time.

**Speaker B:** Structuring.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I enjoyed it.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Very good. All right. Oh, Amrit. What do you.

**Speaker B:** Say? Yeah, quite an enlightening talk, Dhammarato. Just one thing I would make a comment about this involvement in politics. So myself, I observe when I get bored, then I go and check the news, and afterwards I get all worked out. And I think it's kind of started with the hindrance, right? If I'm not bored, then I'm not checking news. So it's a pretty clear cause and effect.

**Speaker A:** Here. Yes, and so it's better if you're bored to go play a game. Yeah, it's better to go have some activity. But watching the news, their job, every newscaster's job, is to make you feel bad. That's their job. They want you to feel bad so you keep watching.

**Speaker D:** Them.

**Speaker A:** If the newscaster came on, Christina, and says, guess what, everything is okay, and then he talked for 30 minutes about how everything is okay, Putin's okay, and Ukraine's okay, and Poland's okay, and China is okay, and the UK is okay, how many people would listen? And he comes on tomorrow and says everything's okay. Newscasters have a job to do, and that is to make money by making you miserable. That's their job, just like it's Karl Rohn's job to make people miserable, because he knows. So I would advise you to do something else other than watch the.

**Speaker D:** News.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just a habit, scrolling habit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is possible that your mind is so free from the problems that you can watch the news and say, "I see that. I know what kind of lie you're telling," and then you're not bothered by it. But if you get upset and uptight about the news, don't watch it. Don't watch. All right. So, Mikey, why don't we take this thing.

**Speaker F:** Home?

**Speaker G:** Yeah. Thanks, friends, for being here today. This is a splendid call. I would like to invite each of you to make friends in the Sangha and continue to do so. It can be really helpful. You know, we were talking about the importance of Sangha earlier on this call, and it can be really helpful to kind of have these one-on-one calls. In fact, I had a call with Eunice and another user earlier today, and it was a delightful call. And that's sort of maybe a soft goal that we can even have is to have a call with another practitioner, perhaps once a week, something like this. Yeah, it's a great way for us to reflect on the Dhamma. You can kind of practice speaking the Buddha Dharma yourself as well, and, you know, hear it from someone else too.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** Okay. So yeah, thank you very much, friends, for being here today. If you're watching this on YouTube, come join us on the Dhamma Friends Discord. There's a link in the video description. And yeah, feel free to share this video around. And you can also find these talks on Spotify, iTunes, and your favorite podcasting platform.

**Speaker A:** We haven't mentioned it for a while, but we do have a website, and that website is just chock-a-block full of all kinds of things that you don't need to read. We've got all the works of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. We have audios of full retreats from both Sankhara and Anagami, Dhamma V2, and some old ones from here. So we've got all kinds of things. We've got links to videos, we've got books that are in publication, and all kinds of stuff that are all done through the website. It's such a big website that it'll take you a week or so just to figure out how to maneuver the place. So go have fun doing that. And so the last thing to say is I'm going to leave the call now, but I invite everybody here on the call to continue to stay online and to discuss what we've talked about today or anything else that you want to talk about. So thank you, Catherine and Agnes, and, uh Christina, we really enjoy when we've got some ladies here. It's great. Thank you. See you.

**Speaker F:** Guys. Thank you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, covers two main themes: **Eric Berne's "Time Structuring"** and the **true meaning of becoming a *Sotāpanna*** (Stream-Enterer). Here is a concise summary:

### **Part 1: Time Structuring (Eric Berne)**
Dhammarato introduces Eric Berne’s six social ways people structure time:
1.  **Withdrawal:** Being physically present but mentally absent.
2.  **Rituals:** Formal or informal repetitive interactions (e.g., greetings).
3.  **Pastimes:** Casual, inconsequential chatting.
4.  **Activities:** Cooperative work or tasks.
5.  **Games:** Psychological transactions with hidden payoffs (often manipulative).
6.  **Intimacy:** Genuine, honest connection (not necessarily sexual).

**Key Point:** While Berne’s model describes ordinary social psychology, the Buddha’s teaching is about **freeing oneself** from these often instinctual, unexamined social patterns. The Dhamma practitioner restructures time around wholesome mental development instead.

### **Part 2: The True Path to Stream-Entry (Sotāpanna)**
This is the core of the talk. Dhammarato critiques modern meditation trends and outlines the authentic path based on the *Kosambiya Sutta* (MN 48).

*   **Critique of "Vipassana" & "Retreat" Models:** He argues that popular "insight meditation" (e.g., Goenka-style) often emphasizes passive observation without **active change**, missing the essential element of **Right Effort**. True practice is a **"change model."**
*   **The First Knowledge – The Foundational Attitude:** The first and crucial step on the Noble Path is the **unshakable confidence (saddhā) and zeal** that *no matter how obstructed the mind is, you can change it*. You see a hindrance (e.g., anger, sloth) and know: *"I can drop this right now and gladden the mind."* This proactive, winner’s attitude is **not held by ordinary people**.
*   **The Seven Knowledges of a Sotāpanna:** He explains the progressive knowledges that culminate in Stream-Entry:
    1.  **Zeal/Confidence:** The certainty that hindrances can be abandoned.
    2.  **Tranquility (Samatha):** Steadying the mind after removing hindrances, enabling clear seeing.
    3.  **Knowledge of the Path:** Unification of mind; knowing without doubt what the path is (the Noble Eightfold Path) and what is not.
    4.  **Freedom from Wrongdoing:** The ability to happily confess and abandon unwholesome behavior.
    5.  **Mindfulness of the Dhamma:** Keeping the Dhamma in mind during all activities, like a cow watching her calf.
    6.  **Enthusiasm for the Dhamma:** A growing eagerness to hear, read, and discuss the Dhamma.
    7.  **Delight in the Dhamma:** The culminating joy and freedom of being immersed in the Dhamma.

**The Sotāpanna State:** It is **not a certificate given by a teacher** based on special experiences. It is a **self-known inner attainment**: a delightful, unwavering confidence in the path, with the underlying tendencies of doubt and identity-view eradicated. One is "in the stream," floating happily with the Dhamma. Remaining defilements (like subtle greed/ill-will) are like weeds that are continually spotted and plucked until they die out (the Arahant state).

### **Part 3: Q&A – Applying the Teachings**
The discussion applies these principles to practitioners' challenges:

*   **On "Observing vs. Changing" Hindrances:** Emphasizes that simply observing a bad feeling isn't enough; you must see it as a **mental creation you can change**.
*   **On Clinging to Views (Karwan's Dilemma):** A major theme emerges: **letting go of opinions**. Holding rigid views ("I'm right," "This is wrong") is an instinctual "territory" that causes suffering. The antidote is to adopt an attitude of **"not sure,"** observe freshly, and focus on what is truly your business—your own mind. Clinging to "the good" can be as harmful as clinging to evil, leading to inner and outer conflict.
*   **On Engagement with Worldly Problems:** The advice is to **prioritize your own happiness and mental clarity**. Most worldly issues are "not my business." By finding inner peace first, any subsequent action or speech comes from a place of clarity and kindness, not from reactive, opinionated ego.

### **Overall Message**
The path is one of **active, joyful self-mastery**. Replace unwholesome time-structuring with diligent Dhamma practice. Cultivate the **zeal to change your mind** in every moment, develop unwavering confidence in the path, and let go of clinging to views. This leads to the genuine happiness and freedom of Stream-Entry, which is known from within, not bestowed from without.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain complex Buddhist and psychological concepts. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Dandelion Root:** This is the central metaphor of the talk. The speaker compares underlying tendencies or defilements (greed, ill-will, views) to a dandelion growing in a sidewalk crack. You can't always rip out the deep root immediately without damaging the "sidewalk" (your life/mind), but every time a leaf (a hindrance or unwholesome thought) appears, you can "whack it off." By consistently doing this through mindful awareness and right effort, the root (the underlying tendency) eventually withers and dies. This illustrates the gradual path of purification.

2.  **Camera on a Tripod:** Used to explain *samatha* (tranquility/concentration) and *vipassana* (insight). A shaky, waving camera (an unsettled mind) cannot take a clear photo (see reality clearly). You need to steady it on a tripod (*samatha*) to get a good, clear shot (*vipassana*). The metaphor emphasizes that calm stability of mind is necessary for clear seeing.

3.  **The Stream (for Sotāpanna):** The speaker describes the Sotāpanna ("stream-entere") not as someone just dipping a toe in, but as someone "laying on his back in the middle of the stream... floating down the stream... just enjoying the heck out of life." This contrasts the hesitant beginner with one who is fully immersed in and carried by the Dharma, experiencing delight and ease.

4.  **Hot Potato / Mud Ball:** Used to describe holding onto views and opinions. If you throw a mud ball (your opinion) at someone, you get muddy in the process. If you hold a hot potato (a rigid view), it burns you. The metaphor teaches that clinging to "being right" harms the holder first and foremost.

5.  **Mother Cow and Calf:** A metaphor for maintaining continuous mindfulness. Just as a mother cow eats grass but always keeps one eye on her calf, a practitioner goes about daily activities but always "keeps an eye on the Dhamma."

6.  **Moving Target:** The self or reality is described as a "moving target." If you try to write down a definitive list of "who you are," it will change in a month. This metaphor reinforces the teaching of *anicca* (impermanence) and discourages clinging to a fixed identity or view.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Busman's Holiday:** A story from Eric Berne's Transactional Analysis. A bus driver's holiday is to ride the bus as a passenger, allowing him to meet people and see the sights he misses while working. This is used as an example of a "good game" or wholesome way to structure time, contrasting with psychological "bad games" like "Yes, but..."

2.  **The Confessional Joke:** A humorous story about a man who goes to confession to list his sins but won't name names. The priest suggests names, and the man returns to his friend saying, "I'm not sure about the confessional, but I got three new leads." This story illustrates a *misuse* of confession (ritual without genuine intent) and contrasts it with the Buddhist idea of openly acknowledging faults to abandon them.

3.  **Family in a Car:** A vignette used to illustrate Eric Berne's "time structuring" categories in a real-life scenario: the dad (activity: driving), the wife (activity: knitting + pastime: chatting), a boy on a cell phone (game playing), and another scrolling (withdrawal). This makes the psychological model concrete before the speaker explains why we must transcend such ordinary social patterns.

4.  **Historical/Political Examples (Hitler, Putin, Trump, etc.):** These are not detailed stories but referenced as **cautionary tales** to illustrate the danger of clinging fiercely to views (even those believed to be "good") and the futility of trying to control the world based on those views. They serve to warn against the instinct to hold and fight for opinions.

5.  **The Student and the "Whoop-de-doo" Experience:** A critique of certain meditation traditions. The story pattern is: a student has a special experience in meditation, tells a teacher, and the teacher ritually certifies them (e.g., as a Sotāpanna). The speaker dismisses this as a meaningless "ritual" and "bragging rights," arguing that true progress comes from the confident knowledge that one can change one's mind, not from passive experiences.

### **Summary of Rhetorical Purpose**
The metaphors and stories serve to:
*   **Make abstract concepts tangible** (dandelion root, camera tripod).
*   **Contrast wholesome and unwholesome paths** (floating in the stream vs. dipping a toe; Busman's Holiday vs. "Yes, but").
*   **Inject humor and relatability** to critique misguided practices (confessional joke, "whoop-de-doo" experiences).
*   **Ground philosophical teachings in everyday life** (family in a car, mother cow).
*   **Warn against common pitfalls** of the spiritual path (clinging to views, seeking validation, trying to fix the world).

The speaker consistently uses these devices to pivot from Eric Berne's social psychology to the core Buddhist practice of internal transformation, confidence, and release from views.
