### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Basically, the way that we use the concept of Srotapanna returning 7 times is, imagine that several people get into an argument, not with each other, but with an unknown source, one at a time. The ordinary person, when he gets into an argument, He will argue and argue and argue and argue and maybe leave and come back another day and argue and argue and argue again. Yes, over and over and over and over and over again, people get stuck on topics that they care about, and it's because of the caring. Okay, so the Srotapanna is one who will get into an argument and after 7 times will wake up Then he'll put that argument to rest.

**Speaker B:** So 7 times of 7 processes of dependent origination.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you can think of it that way. 7 cycles of dependent origination that winds him up in Dukkha, and then he'll wake up.

**Speaker B:** But that would be a very short amount of time.

**Speaker A:** Right, yes, precisely so. Okay, right, within 5 minutes or so. Yeah, for example, let's say 7, just for the point. Okay, and so, um, then the once-returner is going to, uh, let us say, shout yell one time, like he hears somebody arguing and he says, "Stop it!" And then he'll wake up. And he only has one rude thing to say, and after that he'll wake up, and then he puts an end to it. Okay, the Anagami is the one who does shout in the mind, but it doesn't make it to his mouth. And so he does not return to the Dukkha. He keeps it in his mind and he doesn't let it out. And then for the Arahant, it doesn't come up. That's an easy way for you to understand it, because this all has to do with the rebirth— is the rebirth of the person, the self, in Dukkha. If you understand a little bit about Piti, Samuppada, then you know that the birth immediately is followed by Dukkha. Yes, that's the whole point, is being born is Dukkha. If you have a birth, then you will have old age, sickness, and death. If you're not born, then it does not get old. You do not get sick of it, and you do not get defeated by it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now there is a lot of magic in, uh, let us call it the Buddhist religion. I prefer to it in the sense of because it, uh, what's important to you Western Buddhism. That's because people want magic. They care about it. Okay. And so the other day you and I were talking about, uh, 6 answers to a yes and no question. Do you remember that?

**Speaker B:** Yes. The 6 answers, as in either is, either isn't, either is and is not.

**Speaker A:** It's either yes, no, both, neither, I don't know, and I don't care. Those are the 6. All right, now, yes, where most people get caught is because they care about things. Now let's define the word care, because it's got some various qualities. We can say that the two kinds of cares are caring for and caring about. For instance, you can care for a sick friend. Normally that's done, let us say, in a professional situation without caring about them. You just care for them because that's your job. You care for them because you've got the skills. But most of the time, people care for people because they care about them. So when that person dies, even though they've had care, then the person who cares about them is going to suffer. The person who cares for them may or may not suffer depending upon whether they care about them or not. There is actually a sutta, I think it's number 87, that has the title of it is "Grief Comes from Those Who Were Dear." Now we'll talk about this at a later time, but I'm just talking about the title. If you hold people dear, then those people will cause you grief. If you care about your mom, then when she dies, you're going to grieve.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. If you don't care about her, then you may not even hear about her death at her death. It may be months later. And because you don't care, you're not in a state of grief. You may be— in fact, you should— people will have the thought of, oh well, I don't care about my mom, but I care that I don't care.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Or that I wish that I did care. I wish I had a mom that I could care about. And so they're still in grief. So if we can take that point about, uh, remember that the last time I didn't use the word care with you, I used the word, uh, irrelevant. Yes, right. When things we don't know do not affect us, then they are irrelevant. But almost, uh, would you say.

**Speaker B:** Would you say affect as in emotionally or causally?

**Speaker A:** I didn't hear that last word.

**Speaker B:** So causally.

**Speaker A:** Still don't hear it. Say it closer.

**Speaker B:** As in a cause. Wait, maybe I should— my headphones are empty, unfortunately.

**Speaker A:** You're using the word scar?

**Speaker B:** Cause. Here, I typed it in the chat.

**Speaker A:** Now I see the word cause.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I don't understand your question yet.

**Speaker B:** So things can affect us like in a physical sense or in an emotional sense?

**Speaker A:** Well, if they could— if they affect you in a physical sense and you don't care, or if it affects you in an emotional way, it's probably because you did care. Let us say somebody slapped you. Now, in Christianity, they have the idea, we'll just turn the other cheek, don't care about it. Okay, but if you care, then it's going to affect you emotionally. That getting slapped in the face may hurt a little bit, but it's going to hurt a whole lot more emotionally because you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so in fact, the physical is just secondary. It's got really nothing to do with it. It's all about caring is the grief comes because you don't like it. Bad feelings, Dukkha. Okay, and in that particular point, you were reborn as the one who got slapped. Yeah, rather than being reborn as the one who just turns the other cheek. Okay, one's in Dukkha, the other one is not. Because they cared. They cared not to get slapped. Okay, if you can understand that, then you can also understand that the issue that you have with rebirth is because you care. It matters to you. Yes, yes, of course it does.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it does.

**Speaker A:** Please don't go into denial. Recognize.

**Speaker B:** You care about it. But okay, let's say, as a— to make what this sounds like to me, well, I might not care in that moment. Okay, let's say it is an issue for me now.

**Speaker A:** You called and talked to me 3 times already. You care. Give it up, boy.

**Speaker B:** I do care. I do care.

**Speaker A:** So let's say— point— you care.

**Speaker B:** If I follow your instructions, and that would lead me to the point of not caring, is there any guarantee that I would?

**Speaker A:** Because caring is the same word— in fact, it's a better word in English then clinging. In Paticcasamuppada, it goes from I like it or I don't like it, followed by I want it or I want to get rid of it, and then the clinging is because I care. Caring and clinging are the same thing.

**Speaker B:** But does not caring about something Break this chain and make sure that you don't care about it ever again.

**Speaker A:** Well, your ever againing is caring. Ever again is caring.

**Speaker B:** Well, to me it seems like you're.

**Speaker A:** Clinging to the future is another way of saying it. Ever agains It's part of the vocabulary that you picked up from childhood. It's rubbed in with every religion, and so you've gotten into caring about forevers and forevers.

**Speaker B:** Well, let's say that I do heroin, then I would also not care about anything if I would do certain drugs. Then I would also not care about anything for sure. Well, but that doesn't prevent him.

**Speaker A:** You mentioned the noble states, okay? So the Srotapanna is going to catch himself caring and then stop caring. The Sotagami is going to care as soon as he lets it out. The Anagami cares but he's quick enough to not let that caring out. The Arahant just don't care.

**Speaker B:** So that seems final for the Arya.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Uh, for the, the last stage, the Arahant, that seems final because he doesn't care anymore.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's an anymore. There you go again, off into caring about the future and about permanence.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** No, he doesn't care right now. And if he's in the habit of not caring right now, then next time he might not care then too. Depends upon what habits we've got.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. All right.

**Speaker A:** So the issue is, is that you care a whole lot about a whole lot of stuff, and that gives you pain because you don't get your way. You care to have it this way and it turns out that way. And if you didn't give a flying rip, then it wouldn't matter to you. All right, now you're beginning to understand. We can have many examples of this. One of them is, is that there's an election in the U.S. coming up in, in a couple of weeks, 3 weeks or so, and a whole lot of people care.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And so the Democrats are going to lose some, and the Democrats are going to win some, and the Republicans are going to lose some, and the Republicans are going to win some. And the wins that they have are good, but the losses they care about. It's because of the caring that they wind up being unhappy. And politics is then kind of a guarantee that you're going to be unhappy. The only way to not be affected by politics is by not caring about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you've already determined that you really don't know whether rebirth exists or not.

**Speaker B:** I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. But you, but you still care an awful lot about it. Yes, you care about something you have no knowledge of, just like the Republicans and Democrats care about an election, and they right now don't have have a clue about how things are going to work out. You don't know what the future is going to be. The only thing that you know is that's what's happening right now. And yet a lot of people are in great deal of suffering in all kinds of ways because they really care about something that they know nothing about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But the Buddha did give some comments on people with the same issue that I have, and it's in the— I think it's the— is A.N. Oh, that's not the Middle Discourses, that's a different one.

**Speaker A:** Anguttara Nikaya. Yes, the numbers. So the angu comes from angle or fingers. You can see the word finger in there, so that means by the numbers. And guitar on the kind of the angle.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, one second, just got to plug in my charger. Okay, so in AN 366, the Buddha talks about the For assurances, one of.

**Speaker A:** The things that we can say is that the Anguttara Nikaya, when it's quoting the Buddha, it's actually second or third hand. The Anguttara Nikaya was done probably centuries after the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so is Arahant— is that part of the Pali Canon, like of the two Paticcasamuppada? Yeah, so I've understood that you think the Visuddhimagga is a bad source.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That Buddhaghosa's book, the Visuddhimagga, that is a bad source.

**Speaker A:** The Visuddhimagga was written over 1,000 years after the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, by Buddhaghosa, right?

**Speaker A:** And a whole lot of ordinary people who call themselves Buddhist are very, very interested in that book. Yes, but the more you read it with wisdom, the less value it has.

**Speaker B:** So what would you say are good sources for the, for the suttas?

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Oh, all right, the original ones. The original ones like Udana, Sutta Nipata and the Majjhima Nikaya was written at the time of the death of the Buddha, about, uh, the first year after his death they had the First Council, and that's what the outcome of that was, the Majjhima Nikaya. Okay, the Second Council, the outcome of that was the Vinaya, or the Vinaya.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the monastic code. Yeah, okay. Um, so I'm still going to talk about the Arahant just to hear your thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I do too. There's some good stuff in there. I just don't attribute it to Buddha. I make sure the students understand that that stuff comes from later monks.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So in this particular sutta, teaches that anyone pursuing the Buddhist or the Buddha path has four assurances. First being, okay, if there is life after death. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Um, perhaps if you can get a little— your, your voice is actually kind of muddy for me. If you can get closer to the microphone, I might be able to understand you better. In fact, you've frozen completely now.

**Speaker C:** Hello, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sorry, I think it's my internet. Is this better audio quality?

**Speaker A:** Your audio quality is muffled. It's like you're covering the microphone.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I will check if I can change.

**Speaker A:** We'll just get it.

**Speaker C:** Okay, now it should be— now I should be switched to my AirPods. Is that right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the voice is exactly the same as it was. The headphones don't have anything to do with the microphone every time.

**Speaker C:** Okay, is this better? Now I'm closer.

**Speaker A:** Uh, no, but go ahead, just speak very slowly for me.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so in the sutta it is said that there are four assurances for anyone pursuing the Buddhist path.

**Speaker A:** You're talking about Anguttara 3, number 56?

**Speaker C:** It's 3:66. Anguttara.

**Speaker A:** Number 256.

**Speaker C:** Oh, that, that could be. I've got it written down as 366.

**Speaker A:** Uh, let me look it up. Let me see what I can find on the twos. The number discourse is number twos. This is not working.

**Speaker C:** Oh, here I've got it. It is, uh, I will send it to you.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker C:** And it's right at the bottom, the part I'm talking about. So I will repeat it.

**Speaker A:** This is the, uh, the Kalama Sutta.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's Enguttara number 3, number 65, and 66.

**Speaker C:** Uh, okay, so this.

**Speaker B:** Is the Kalama Sutta.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, that's a very interesting one in the sense that it proves the point that I've been making solidly.

**Speaker C:** Uh, in what way? Sorry, I don't understand.

**Speaker A:** Well, the Kama Sutra that I know, it says at the end of it, if there does exist rebirth, then you have the benefits of what you've been doing in this life. But if you— if there is no rebirth, then you still have the benefits of it in this life.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's the whole point, is that he's not confronting the Kammamas. This is the first time that they've talked to him, and he's trying to get them to move in the right direction.

**Speaker C:** Okay, but for me, it feels like there is one possibility that is not discussed in this sutta. And that is, okay, so here there are two options given. Either there is a life after this one, and that life bears the actions and fruits of this life, or there isn't, or yeah, or there is no life after this. But why does a next life have to bear the fruits of this life.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is that's what is commonly believed by the common fools of the world. About 90% of human beings are very foolish and will believe anything because they care.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And when they stop caring and stop looking directly, they can see directly if there is a world after death If there is the fruit and the results of actions rightly or wrongly done, then this is the basis by which, with the breakup of the body after death, that I will reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world. This is the first assurance that is there, if they are depending upon the results of the actions. But the second point is the one that just destroys that. "But if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of the results of actions rightly or wrongly, then here in this present life, I look after myself with ease, free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble. There is no This is the second assurance. Okay, so if you look at it like that, then it has to do with what's in our mind and how we behave, and the future life is irrelevant.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but okay, so this is according to the belief in Kamma that he describes. The people that he's talking to believe in Kamma.

**Speaker A:** But everybody believes in Kamma. Yeah, because the word Kamma just means action.

**Speaker C:** Yes, well, the law of karma then.

**Speaker A:** And the result of Kamma, that's the Kamma, the results of your actions. If there is a future life, then what you're doing now will result in, uh, benefits or loss in that. But even if you're not reborn, you still get the benefits here and now in this life. That's what the Buddha teaches. But if you believe in rebirth and then waste this life because you've got another chance, then guess what? You've wasted this life, and you have no assurances or guarantees that a future life does exist. All you do have the assurance is because you've wasted this life, you're going to have to put up with the results in the next life of having wasted this one.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's a possibility.

**Speaker A:** And well, that's your only possibility right now, the way that you're clinging.

**Speaker C:** All right, to be clear for my own intentions, like I've already decided for myself that even if there is the possibility of next life, I don't want to waste this life. So I want to do what I can in this life.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so all we have to do now is start doing that and just dropping things that you know nothing about and stop caring about it.

**Speaker C:** But there's one thing I just want to understand, so I'm on the same page as you. So as a Westerner, I also believe in that there is a possibility of randomness and chance in the universe.

**Speaker A:** So there is no such thing as randomness. Everything winds up being a pseudo-random. Yes, randomness only means that the human being who is calling it random doesn't understand all of the cause and effects that go into it, but nothing happens according to random. Everything happens according to cause and effect. That's physics.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but Western people, let us say fools who are not educated in physics or engineering, they've heard this word random.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, we use it We use the random number generators with computers for arranging decks of cards and all of that kind of stuff. So when a card— when a card deck is shuffled, people think of it as random. They're not random. Yeah, but the order of the cards, you do not know how the cards were shuffled and/or stacked. That in fact, the good card shark, when he is shuffling the cards, will palm one or two cards so that you can't see the fact that he's got a card in his hand while he's shuffling. It's not random. He's intentionally made sure it's not random. But everybody sitting at that poker table thinks it is a randomly shuffled deck. No deck of cards has ever been actually random. The closest thing they could come to would be a random number generator on a computer, but computer random numbers are pseudo-random numbers. They've got algorithms that produce that number.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's right. I agree with you fully on that.

**Speaker A:** So let's say there's no such thing as actual random. What we have is pseudo-random, which means we don't understand the actual chain of events that brought about that event, but nothing actually is completely random. You just don't know.

**Speaker C:** I don't know. Yes, I agree. But my point being here is that in my mind, a next life doesn't have to be like my actions in this life don't necessarily need to have a impacts on my next life, uh, if there is such a thing.

**Speaker A:** Well, if there is a next life, it's not going to be you. Um, well, real teaching, and that's the distinction between rebirth and reincarnation. Reincarnation is the belief that when that future life happens, it's me again. The reality is that no, it's not me again, it's something else.

**Speaker C:** Okay, but should I put this?

**Speaker A:** You can.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so consciousness can't really— it's something that is.

**Speaker A:** The only reason consciousness— we've already talked a little bit about it— is dependently arisen. Okay, now here's where we're going with this, and that is, is that while you are clinging, while you are caring about rebirth and reincarnation, you will keep asking questions. And no matter what answers I give you, you will reject them because you still care that rebirth and reincarnation exist?

**Speaker C:** Well, I don't want to say that it exists because I don't know that.

**Speaker A:** But you still care. You don't know, but you care. You want it to be true.

**Speaker C:** There's just one possibility in my mind, and I haven't heard any good evidence by anyone why it's not a possibility, and that is that there is a next life and my actions in this life don't have necessarily a positive impact on that next life, even though I would get enlightened in this life.

**Speaker A:** But you don't know anything. That's the whole point. That's what this sutta is about, is that the fruits and the results of the actions in this life affect this life. All right, that's what the whole point is here. That's why the big word starts there, the great big word, the word— possibly the biggest word in the English language— if. I— F— and you have skipped right by that word, and it was the biggest word on the page.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, why did you skip the word if? Because of your confirmation bias. It's because you care about something that you know nothing about.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but okay, so before you started practicing and you read this sutta, would you be totally assured by the sutta.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, comfortable, it depends upon whether this sutta can help people come out of their confirmation bias, or whether this sutta actually, let us say, adds more weight to their confirmation bias. In other words, you can read this and be confirmed in your Klingon.

**Speaker C:** Yes, sorry, do you have one minute? I just need to go to the bathroom real quick.

**Speaker A:** All.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker C:** So you were talking about Yeah, about the assurances. So it can, for me, it doesn't help me out of my confirmation bias. That's what you are saying, basically.

**Speaker A:** That if you already believe what you believe and you're attached to that, you care about it even though you know nothing about it. You've heard all of this stuff, it sounds very delicious. But in fact, that's the reason why the teachings of Jesus did not catch on, but the teachings of Paul caught on big time. So why? The Paul— the teachings of Paul were quite delicious. He promised something that Jesus did not promise— heaven and hell. That is, and making Jesus a big superstar high in the sky that's going to help you get into heaven. That's the teaching of Paul. And that's why Christianity caught on, is because fools like that kind of assurance. Where Jesus taught things like the Kingdom of Heaven is within you. Yes, it's not way out there someplace. Yeah, it's not a promise, it's an actuality. And so here you are clinging to promises instead of, uh, doing the actuality.

**Speaker C:** Yes. To me, it's just a terrifying idea that I can be reborn into a next life and that my actions in this life don't have an impact on that next life, but that my consciousness or experience gets transferred.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's satisfying to you because you're dissatisfied with this life. You want another shot at it.

**Speaker C:** No, I actually don't want to be reborn.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well then don't. And the first way that you can stop being reborn is by stop clinging to the idea of being reborn.

**Speaker C:** I don't see how that would stop such a process?

**Speaker A:** Well, stop thinking about the future, because that's what rebirth is all about—a deep, dark future you know nothing about, only the promises by some charlatan. But in fact, the whole teaching of rebirth is a control issue. If somebody can get you to believe in rebirth, then you'll go to that person and say, what do I do to have a good rebirth? And now he's got you. He owns your ass. If he's a Christian teaching about heaven, then you're a Christian and you're going to pay him and pay and put money in the plate and do what you're told to do because you think that his teaching is delicious. The reality is you don't know.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but do you then acknowledge the possibility, regardless of it's helpful or not helpful, that there could be a next life where the fruits of this life don't have an impact on the next life?

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't care. I don't need one. I don't want one. I plan not to be reborn. That way.

**Speaker C:** You plan, okay, but is it a possibility?

**Speaker A:** I plan on it by not having much of this life either.

**Speaker C:** By not having— yeah, by not being reborn.

**Speaker A:** So what you— what you're telling me now is, is that people who are reborn are reborn without them having any say-so in it at all?

**Speaker C:** Well, as far as I know, it's a possibility. I'm not saying that it's true because I honestly— but if it is true.

**Speaker A:** Then people are reborn without any choice.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, like the Christians believe, is that after you die, you've got a soul, and that soul is like a football, and God's going to kick it one way or the other, and you've got no choice about it. Now you're completely under the control of some authority figure.

**Speaker B:** Well.

**Speaker C:** It could be that, like I see how such a belief is not necessarily helpful, but I feel like that it's being denied because it's not helpful, but the whole point for me in pursuing Buddhism and not the religion type, but is that there is no opium in it per se. And I feel like Christianity is more of an opium, like a delicious teaching, as you say.

**Speaker A:** And I just want— what is that opium? The opium of that you will survive death. Yeah, that's the opium. And you're drugged up right now, heavily sedated.

**Speaker C:** I'm terrified about the possibility. I don't want to be reborn. I want to— Well, then don't.

**Speaker A:** Stop it. I've seen you being reborn a dozen times in this call.

**Speaker C:** But we're talking about two different kinds of rebirth.

**Speaker A:** There is only one kind of rebirth, the kind of rebirth that happens in the mind.

**Speaker C:** Then you're denying that there is a life after death.

**Speaker A:** Well, the rebirth off into the future is still all in your mind, and you keep bringing it back up.

**Speaker C:** So the process of dependent origination, what I wanted to ask you is, the body or the senses, the aggregates, they are one link in the process, right?

**Speaker A:** Uh, that's a complicated question. Go, go for your real question.

**Speaker C:** Okay, um, my question is then, does dependent origination continue after the breakup of the body?

**Speaker A:** It depends upon what book you.

**Speaker C:** Read.

**Speaker A:** So if you read the book on the Visuddhimarga, it talks about 3 lifetimes. Yes, now if you understand those 3 lifetimes as the immediate past, the immediate present, and the immediate future, then it has some value. But if you believe the way that Buddhagosa has put it out— which, by the way, Buddhagosa was a Brahman And he was teaching Brahmanism in that book that he wrote. The question is, did he do so ignorantly or maliciously? And that's an argument that I've had with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa goes for that he was a wise fool. He had a lot of information. He just had, you know, like a gaping hole in his brain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I take an opposite viewpoint. I take that he knew what he was talking about and he chose to mislead people intentionally. He actually did know. A lot of people really do know the truth and they teach otherwise. Most Baptist preachers, in fact, come to the point that they don't believe in Christianity, but now they're still stuck in the pulpit. Probably the best example of that is the Bible scholar who really, really knows the Bible because he studied it for years, and now he is employed as a senior professor at a Bible college, a seminary, and he has to teach his students what he now no longer believes. No, that happens often, and that's the state that Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa could have been in. He knew what was going on, but he chose to write for the fools because there's money in it. He can make some money off of it. His family can get wealthy. But if he denounces his family, he's going to lose a great deal, just like a Baptist preacher would lose a great deal if he started teaching the Truth from the pulpit. He'd lose his house, he'd lose his car, he'd lose his wife, he'd lose his children, he'd lose his job, he would lose his status in the community, and he would lose everything. So it's better just to keep lying about it.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Have you seen Prabhupada's commentary on the Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's allegations, I could say, about the Sisu Dhammarati.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm much more interested in who associated with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa than who his enemies were. Okay, yeah, because the associations with the wise will have a few notaries. Those who were, let's say, well-educated, well-skilled, well-trusted in the Thai community, as opposed to, let us say, ordinary people who started out ordinary, remained ordinary, put on a robe ordinary, studied the suttas with their confirmation bias, and now are writing things of which they have no knowledge. Yeah, I can give you some examples of that, but I would choose not to.

**Speaker C:** Okay, yeah, you don't, you don't have to.

**Speaker A:** Western monks are absolute fools.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't call him, I wouldn't put him in that group. I would put him in the middle group. Okay, those who know the truth but teach ignorance to ignorant people, and then we'll teach wisely to the wise.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And that's the standard way of letting ignorant people remain ignorant.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you just kind of go along. I've got a story about that, by the way. This happened in Sri Lanka. Excuse me, it happened in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. A good friend of mine, David, who was ordained at that time, was going to Malaysia to get his visa. And when he went there, he decided to go to the big Thai temple in Kuala Lumpur, which happened to, at that point in time, the abbot of it, of this Thai wat, was Sri Lankan. I don't remember his name, that was so many years ago. When David got there, this old monk, Sri Lankan monk, was having a conversation in English with a Chinese woman whose husband had just died. Because she was an ordinary person believing in rebirth, the Ajahn consulted her, told her that her husband was in a better place and all that kind of stuff. And David's standing over there in his robe saying, well, I'm wasting my time with this dude. Yeah, he waited it out. And when he talked to the monk and said that he had come from Wat Suwan Mokkh, this monk changed his personality completely. And that's very, very characteristic. I've seen it often. In fact, that's the way that Buddhism has traditionally been taught, is you talk foolish to foolish people. There was no reason for that senior monk to have disturbed that old Chinese woman by just telling her to get over it. Don't blame to the dead. He's dead now, get over it. Yeah, that would have not been a good thing to do because she was not going to be able to get over it. That might have, uh, given her a great deal of grief. And so you go along to kind of let people be because you don't want to add to their suffering. You don't want to add to their Dukkha.

**Speaker C:** Would you do the same thing?

**Speaker A:** I am privileged enough to know that I don't have to talk to old Chinese women.

**Speaker C:** Okay. But would you speak the uncomfortable truth to people?

**Speaker A:** Actually, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, if there's anything that makes him extraordinary or unique, it's not what he taught, but who he taught. That in fact, he was brought up on Sangha dissesa charges in the 1930s, and the result of the— or the outcome of the monk's court called a Sangha dissesa was that he was teaching the right things to the wrong people.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] That's an interesting discussion.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so he was teaching the right things to the wrong people because he was not interested in holding out. That traditionally a monk would go to a senior monk— let us say it this way— that the truth is only let out when the right person is asking the right person, or the right question, to the right noble at the right time And that will then unlock the door, and the student then can be led into the noble teaching. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has said it's time for us not to do this; let's go back to the time of the Buddha and recognize that we will not spend much time in agreeing with them, but agree with them only long enough to get them to have faith in the teaching of the Buddha, and then he's going to start teaching them correctly.

**Speaker C:** So that's Buddha Das's approach?

**Speaker A:** No, Buddha Das's approach is let's let it all hang out. We've got truth here, let's go ahead and put it out there, and those who can take it can take it, and those who hate it will hate it. But we're going to be real, we're going to tell the truth.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's Bhikkhu Buddha Das's approach, and in fact that's my, uh, instruction for from Achan Po is that when I'm on the internet, I don't teach with the one-two punch. I only teach the supermundane noble Dhamma. I do not teach ordinary beliefs that are held by ordinary people. No, the real teachings of the Buddha. But I don't advertise. I'm just here. You called me. I did not hand you some pamphlet like the Jehovah's Witnesses would say.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, true.

**Speaker A:** I do not go knocking on doors trying to spread the Dharma. I only want to speak to people who are willing to hear it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm certainly grateful for that. I prefer the uncomfortable truth over the opium, let's put it that way. But So you were saying it's according to which book you read about dependent origination continuing or not continuing?

**Speaker A:** Not necessarily. No, you're assuming that the book has power over you. It's not which books you read, it's do you know how to read.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so let's say I read the books correctly.

**Speaker A:** Well, so far you haven't. So far you've been believing all kinds of crap. Yeah, because it fits in with what you already believed before that.

**Speaker C:** And well, I'm trying to understand, because.

**Speaker A:** You really want to believe in rebirth, and yet now you're becoming terrified of the possibility. So look at the fact that you've been shifting some You're a moving target.

**Speaker C:** A moving target. You are right on that. At first I wanted it to be true, I guess, and then I thought—.

**Speaker A:** You wanted it to not be true. And the reality is that you actually do not know, and it does not matter.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but the only thing is, like, when I ask this question, like, do you acknowledge— and not just you, but also other persons— Every person I ask, do you acknowledge that there is a possibility of a life after this one?

**Speaker A:** Well, the answer to that is, I don't know and I don't care. And that is, that's the easiest way I can say it. But I've heard a lot of people get a lot of confusion over a lot of the things that I have said. So let's be very careful people about that. As far as the future goes, I'm not talking about whether rebirth or reincarnation exists or not. I'm saying for all future things, I don't know and I don't care. I do not know who's going to win the election next month, and I don't care. I do not know who's going to win the war in Ukraine, and I don't care.

**Speaker C:** It's fair that you say this, because now I feel like you acknowledge the possibility at least, because you don't know.

**Speaker A:** I'm not saying that it's possible or not. I don't know even that. That in fact, if you go from pure physics, it's deadly not possible. It's strictly through physics not possible. There's a lot of things that physics haven't figured out. Now we're even in the sense of trying to figure out about what the original cause was. Was there a Big Bang or what? The answer is I don't know and I don't care.

**Speaker C:** And according to physics, is reincarnation based on Kamma possible?

**Speaker A:** Well, it doesn't matter. We're not interested in possibilities, we're actually interested in the reality of this moment, not interested in the future.

**Speaker C:** But would you say it's possible?

**Speaker A:** I would say that you care too much about it, and that caring is what's going to prevent you from practicing the Dharma correctly. That's why this is the first fetter. Yes, the first fetter. You have to get over this very first fetter and stop caring about the future so that you can start practicing in the present moment correctly. So long as you care about the future, you're not practicing correctly.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so Yesterday or the day before, you told me something, a trick. And so if you ask 3 times, then you have to answer. So after this, I will not question you again about this. I will promise you that. So is it according to physics? Is it possible that there is rebirth, reincarnation after death based on Kamma, so based on actions?

**Speaker A:** Do you want a fool's answer? Do you want a wise answer from someone who has studied the Dhamma? Or do you want an engineer's answer? Do you want a preacher's answer? What answer do you want? Let's go ahead and do the engineer's answer. Okay, all right. So the idea then is, is that there is a relationship between a person, which we will call now a soul, and, uh, the— and the actions that that person or soul has done. Now There is much action. How many actions have you taken in the past 57 minutes?

**Speaker C:** A lot of actions, a lot of thinking.

**Speaker A:** A lot of actions. Do you think that the Kamma machine up there is keeping track of all of the actions? Well, it's got to. How is it going to determine what's a good action and what's a bad action? How is it going to weight them? What's a great big bad action versus a tiny little good action?

**Speaker C:** To be fair, like, in the— that's the Indian type of karma.

**Speaker A:** I'm not Indian, I'm an engineer right now. A lot of Indians are engineers, and one of the most important qualities of an Indian as an engineer is that he stops being a Hindu and becomes an engineer instead.

**Speaker C:** But as an engineer, why do you talk about karma?

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm using the word Kamma because I'm talking about action, and that's the definition of the word action.

**Speaker C:** But I mean, like, rebirth, about the.

**Speaker A:** Kamma machine, that, that machine that determines— now Christians call that machine, they give it a personality and call it God. The Muslims have the, uh, have that Kamma machine and they give it a name and a personality and they call it Allah. Anicca, etc., etc., etc. Right? But whatever it is, good old whatever it is, the idea that we're refuting is that something is not only keeping track of all actions, say, done by humans, and weighting them according to some scale, so that it can figure out what's going to happen in the future. So, imagine what kind of computer that's going to have to be. That's trillions and trillions of times more powerful than any computer that humans have ever had. And where is that computer going to be located? Inside of a star or something? Not a chance! Things are very simple inside of a star. There is nothing in the Universe that's as complex as the human Hindu belief in the Kamma machine. So let's go— now wait a minute, just let's keep going with this. Let's look at a soul. How is this Kamma machine going to determine what soul is what, which one belongs to whom? In Nagasaki, 100,000 people died within a second. Let's just make it easy and put a bus full of people that goes over a bridge and they all die. Now here comes God, or here comes the Kamma machine, How is he going to know which one is which? Because now they're souls, they're no longer— I mean, the body's dead, it's gone. Where is the— where is the soul? Whose soul is it? Now let's look at how many billions of humans there are on the planet Earth right now. Is, uh, uh, 7 times 10 to the 9th. But with the belief of Kamma, oh, you can be born in an animal, so now you have to factor in all of the bugs that have ever existed, all of the animal life that's ever existed, and now we're up to maybe 10^23, which means that we have to have, let us say, a Kamma security number, like a Social Security number, only this one is not 8 or 9 digits, this one has to be at least 23 or 24 digits, which means it is even more complicated than DNA. And yet, what do you have inside of you that has your unique identification that is so strong and so solid that it will in fact survive death? And so the engineer takes a look at this whole idea of rebirth and reincarnation. And recognizes that it is mathematically stupid. It is mathematically foolish. It could not possibly exist. It's just a belief system, it's a concept that has never had an actuality to it. Automobiles and motorbikes and even chariots started out as a concept. And they can be manufactured. And so you do have an automobile, but the automobile itself is just in your mind. The chariot is just in your mind. That's why Anagami took Malanda's chariot apart to prove to him that there is no chariot there in that chariot. You take the basket apart and you take the wheels apart, you take the ribs apart, and you do all of that kind of stuff. Where's the chariot? And you say, "Well, it's all over the place," but really, the chariot is in the mind of Malanda; it's not real. There is no inherent self or soul in a chariot; there is no such thing as chariot-ness.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] What about consciousness?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Bhikku] What about it? You haven't studied Paticcasamuppada yet; you're just off asking questions again. Confirmation, verification, to confirm your bias. I mean, so long as we're off on this kind of stuff, you're not learning any Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I just think it's a very.

**Speaker A:** Important— it's not important. It's what you mean by you say it's important means is that you cling to it strongly. That's what importance really is. There is nothing in this world important until someone clings to it and calls it important, and then it's important. Importance is a concept of your mind, just like chariot or rebirth and reincarnation.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so where consciousness is a word that we use to describe an actuality, an event. Sight exists. You can see, I can see, every human, this dog here can see, the other dogs in the other room can see, the rats in the house can see, the geckos can see. Sight exists. Now what does that mean? Sight Consciousness, it exists and can be proven over and over and over again. So many tens of thousands of times it's been proven that we don't even bother to put it into a scientific experiment, because it's clearly obvious that seeing happens. That's consciousness. But consciousness is dependently arisen, depends upon what you're looking at. If you've got your eyes closed, you can't see. If you're in the dark, you can't see. If the object that you're looking at actually is not there, then you cannot see it.

**Speaker C:** Yes, and consciousness has no identity, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, it's a process. It's a process of the human mind and the eyes and the body. It's a process.

**Speaker C:** And that process can go on beyond death.

**Speaker A:** Beyond the breakup of the death. When you close your eyes, I-consciousness disappears. You don't have it anymore. It's gone.

**Speaker C:** But since craving precedes—.

**Speaker A:** No, consciousness is dependently arisen, period.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but in the process, craving precedes consciousness, right?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** In the process of dependent origination, craving precedes consciousness.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker C:** Oh, it doesn't?

**Speaker A:** No, Sankhara. Jiva, Sankhara, Sangha, Nama Rupa, Salyatana, Pañña, Vedana, etc.

**Speaker C:** Upadana. And that's ignorance is the first, first.

**Speaker A:** Link, which is where you're stuck.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're stuck in it.

**Speaker C:** So since ignorance precedes.

**Speaker A:** Consciousness— If you start asking random questions about it, eventually I'll get around to teaching you, Paticcasamuppada. So long as you're caught in asking a bunch of questions, you will never get satisfaction. It's kind of like a college student who goes into the college classroom with 100 or 200 people in there, let's call it a physics classroom, and that student just will not shut up. He keeps asking questions that are irrelevant to what the teacher wants to teach. Yeah, and I have a lot of students like that that just will not shut up unless they keep asking questions and asking questions. And because of that, teaching them Dharma is very difficult to do. It's impossible, in fact. Okay, because they don't lie to you by answering your questions.

**Speaker C:** Yes, I'm very grateful for that. And therefore, I will ask you one last question and then I will shut up.

**Speaker A:** I don't think that this is going to be the last one. I think that when I'm talking about this one, you'll come up with another question.

**Speaker C:** I actually had a list of questions and we've discussed pretty much everything. I will not bother you with the other ones. But in the Four Noble Truths that you have, in the Fourth Noble Truth, it says that there's an end to suffering and that can be gained through insight.

**Speaker A:** The fourth noble truth is the Eightfold Noble Path.

**Speaker C:** Sorry, I'm mistaken by which truth then, but my question comes down to— The.

**Speaker A:** Fourth noble truth is the end of suffering. And you can get to the end of suffering, and could have many times during this hour, but you're still caught in questions, you're still caught in suffering. You haven't come to the state of knowing that you can come out of the suffering, basically by shutting up.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so it's really the last question. I will finish it and then I will shut up about it. So if there is no rebirth, only.

**Speaker A:** Birth— I didn't say there was no rebirth. I'm saying I don't know and I don't care. Okay, but— And you're still stuck on the clinging to, well, maybe it exists. What if it exists?

**Speaker C:** I mean, like, if— is rebirth not a necessary factor for the Third Noble Truth? Because if there is no rebirth, then death would be the end of suffering.

**Speaker A:** Now you're not dead yet. Why don't you come out of your suffering right bloody now? But that stuff right now, that the.

**Speaker C:** Whole problem of Samsara would not be really a problem if death—.

**Speaker B:** I don't understand Sankhara.

**Speaker A:** You don't understand it. You think it's a big pile of stuff. No, it's a small pile, and it all is between your ears. That's where your Samskara lies.

**Speaker C:** The same thing as Samsara.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Yes, you keep doing the same stupid things over and over and over again, like keep asking me questions. You've been asking me questions for the past hour. You're caught in the wheel of Samsara. Right now.

**Speaker C:** Those were all my questions, so now I will leave the word to you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, this is what I'd like to do since we've kind of, let us say, wasted this hour. Why don't you call me tomorrow and we'll start talking about Dhamma?

**Speaker C:** Okay. I'll do that.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right, all right. Well, we'll see you tomorrow then.

**Speaker C:** Thank you very much for your teachings, much appreciated.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye-bye, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (primarily Speaker B/C), is a dynamic, Socratic dialogue exploring core Buddhist concepts through the lens of **practical application and present-moment understanding.** The central theme is that **suffering (dukkha) arises from and is perpetuated by "caring" (clinging/attachment),** and the path of awakening is a progressive letting go of that caring.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Four Stages of Awakening (A Simplified, Practical Model)**
Dhammarato provides a modern, psychological analogy for the four stages of stream-entry:
*   **Sotāpanna (Stream-enterer):** Gets caught in an argument (mental disturbance) but after **"7 times"** (representing cycles of dependent origination), wakes up and stops. They break the habit *within* the event.
*   **Sakadāgāmī (Once-returner):** Lets out **one shout** (a reactive outburst) and *then* wakes up and stops.
*   **Anāgāmī (Non-returner):** The shout arises **only in the mind** but is stopped before it is expressed.
*   **Arahant:** The reactive impulse **doesn't arise at all.** There is no "birth" of the self in that moment of conflict.

**The Key Insight:** "Birth" here is the **momentary rebirth of the sense of "I"** in a state of dukkha (e.g., "I am offended," "I am arguing"). Ending suffering means stopping this instantaneous rebirth through non-clinging.

### **Central Argument: Suffering = Caring/Clinging**
*   **Caring vs. Caring For:** Dhammarato distinguishes *caring for* (skillful, compassionate action) from *caring about* (emotional attachment that leads to grief when things change). The latter is synonymous with **clinging (upādāna)** in Dependent Origination.
*   **The Root of Dukkha:** All suffering—whether from an argument, a political loss, or fear of rebirth—stems from **caring about outcomes we cannot control.** The physical slap hurts less than the emotional hurt from "caring" about being disrespected.
*   **Freedom is in Irrelevance:** When we truly see we don't know something (like the future) and it doesn't impact our present-moment practice, it becomes **irrelevant.** Making it relevant is an act of clinging.

### **Application to the Rebirth Debate**
A significant portion of the dialogue is Dhammarato guiding a student stuck in intellectual doubt about literal rebirth.
*   **The Problem:** The student's intense questioning about the mechanics of rebirth is itself identified as **a manifestation of clinging (caring)**—the very fetter to be abandoned.
*   **The Kalama Sutta Lesson:** Dhammarato emphasizes the sutta's use of **"if"** and its ultimate point: practice is beneficial **regardless** of rebirth's truth. Clinging to the question wastes this life.
*   **A Pragmatic & Philosophical Stance:** Dhammarato repeatedly states his position: **"I don't know and I don't care."** He argues:
    1.  **Practically:** Obsessing over an unknown future prevents correct practice in the present.
    2.  **Philosophically:** The concept of a karmic ledger and persistent identity is, from an engineer's perspective, impossibly complex and unsupported by evidence.
    3.  **Psychologically:** The belief is often a control mechanism or a "delicious opium" that caters to fear and desire.
*   **The Real Rebirth:** The only verifiable, urgent rebirth is the **moment-to-moment rebirth of the ego-self in suffering**, which *can* be ended here and now through the Dhamma.

### **Critical Views on Buddhist Sources**
Dhammarato expresses a strong preference for early texts:
*   **Trusted Sources:** The **Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta Nipata, and Udana** (from the First Council).
*   **Critiqued Sources:** The **Visuddhimagga** (1,000 years post-Buddha) is dismissed as containing Brahmanical influence and potentially deliberate misinformation. The **Anguttara Nikaya** is seen as later and less direct.
*   **Teaching Style:** He advocates the direct, "uncomfortable truth" approach of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**—teaching the "supermundane Dhamma" to those ready to hear it, rather than confirming popular, comforting beliefs.

### **Conclusion & Invitation**
The talk concludes with the student's persistent doubt seen as **proof of being trapped in samsaric questioning.** Dhammarato ends by effectively saying: **Stop theorizing about a future you cannot know. Your suffering is here now, and the end of suffering is possible here now. The endless questions are the wheel of samsara in motion.** He invites a future conversation to move from intellectual debate to actual Dhamma practice.

**In essence, the talk is a forceful, pragmatic call to shift focus from metaphysical speculation to the immediate task of deconstructing the clinging mind, which is the only birth and death that truly matters for ending suffering.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain complex Buddhist concepts, primarily focusing on **suffering (dukkha), rebirth, and the path to enlightenment**. Here are the key ones:

### **1. The Argument Metaphor (for Stages of Enlightenment)**
This is the central, extended metaphor used to explain the four stages of enlightenment (Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmī, Anāgāmī, Arahant) in terms of how a person reacts to a provocation.
*   **Ordinary Person:** Gets into an argument and argues "over and over and over again," stuck in a cycle.
*   **Sotāpanna (Stream-enterer):** Will get into an argument and after **7 times** "will wake up" and put it to rest. (Explained as 7 cycles of dependent origination leading to dukkha).
*   **Sakadāgāmī (Once-returner):** Will shout/yell **one time** ("Stop it!"), then wake up and end it.
*   **Anāgāmī (Non-returner):** Will shout **in the mind** but not let it out verbally, thus not returning to dukkha.
*   **Arahant (Fully enlightened):** The provocation **doesn't even arise** in the mind. They "just don't care."

**Purpose:** To illustrate how enlightenment progressively severs the mental "rebirth" of the self into states of suffering (dukkha) in the present moment.

### **2. The "Caring" Metaphor**
The speaker uses "caring" as a central, accessible metaphor for **clinging (upādāna)** and **craving (taṇhā)**, which are the links in dependent origination that lead to suffering.
*   **Caring *for* vs. Caring *about*:** Distinguishes professional, skillful care (caring *for*) from emotional attachment (caring *about*). Suffering arises from caring *about*.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **A Sick Friend:** You suffer grief if a friend dies if you *cared about* them, not just if you *cared for* them.
    *   **A Slap in the Face:** The physical pain is secondary; the emotional hurt and anger come because you *care* about not being slapped. "You were reborn as the one who got slapped" into a state of dukkha.
    *   **Politics/U.S. Election:** People suffer because they *care* about the outcome. "The only way to not be affected... is by not caring about it."
*   **Link to Rebirth:** The speaker directly states, "caring is the same word... it's a better word in English than clinging." The obsession with rebirth is framed as a prime example of unhelpful "caring" about an unknown future.

### **3. The Chariot Story (Reference to Nagasena and King Milinda)**
The speaker references a famous Buddhist parable to argue against the concept of a permanent self or soul that could be reborn.
*   **The Story:** The monk **Nāgasena** takes apart King Milinda's chariot piece by piece (wheels, axle, etc.) and asks where the "chariot" is. The point is that "chariot" is just a label for a collection of parts; there is no essential, independent "chariot-ness."
*   **Application:** The speaker uses this to argue that just as there is no inherent "chariot," there is no inherent "soul" or permanent self that could carry an identity from one life to another. Rebirth, in the sense of reincarnation, is a "concept that has never had an actuality to it."

### **4. The "Kamma Machine" Thought Experiment**
The speaker adopts an **engineer's perspective** to critique literal rebirth and kamma (karma) as a cosmic accounting system.
*   **The Metaphor:** Imagines rebirth would require a "Kamma machine"—a computer of unimaginable complexity to track every action of every being, weight them, and assign results across lifetimes.
*   **The Argument:** From a physics/engineering standpoint, this is "mathematically stupid... It could not possibly exist." It's presented as a belief system for "fools," not a reality. This story is used to shock the listener out of metaphysical speculation and back to present-moment practice.

### **5. The Story of the Monk and the Grieving Widow**
This is a **sociological story** about skillful teaching.
*   **The Story:** A Sri Lankan monk in Malaysia comforts a grieving Chinese woman with traditional reassurances about her dead husband (e.g., "he's in a better place"). When an ordained student from a rigorous tradition arrives, the monk changes his tone and speaks more advanced Dhamma.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the traditional Buddhist teaching method of "teaching foolish things to foolish people" to avoid causing them more distress, while saving the "super-mundane noble Dhamma" (the uncomfortable truth) for those ready to hear it. The speaker contrasts this with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's (and his own) approach of teaching the "uncomfortable truth" directly.

### **6. The "Six Answers" Framework**
This is a **conceptual metaphor** for possible attitudes.
*   The six answers to a yes/no question (**yes, no, both, neither, I don't know, and I don't care**) are used as a lens.
*   The speaker repeatedly applies the last two—**"I don't know and I don't care"**—to questions about rebirth, the afterlife, and politics. This is framed as the wise, non-clinging attitude of an Arahant applied to speculative questions.

### **Summary of Core Messages via Metaphor:**
*   **Rebirth** is primarily a metaphor for the **moment-to-moment rebirth of the "self" into suffering** (via arguments, anger, craving).
*   **The Path** is a process of learning to **"care" less (cling less)** about things, especially future unknowns.
*   **Enlightenment** is reaching a state where the triggers for suffering **no longer arise**.
*   Speculation about literal afterlife rebirth is a **distraction** rooted in clinging ("caring"), and the wise attitude is one of **dispassionate unknowing** ("I don't know and I don't care").
