### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, hello Robert, we're talking again, this is our third call, and that you seem to be practicing what we had been talking about, at least somewhat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then you asked the question, where do we go from here, or where do we go next? And that, that in some, and in fact in most ways, is the wrong question to ask. A much more appropriate question— it doesn't— in some context it is. What will you do next? Has to do with where you are. And so if you're ready for something next, then there is a next. But if you're not ready for, uh, next because you're not finished with where you are, then next is the same old same old. It's the same thing. And so a hint of the next is that once you get the mind completely wholesome, then the noting starts. In reality, the noting starts, the real noting starts. It's talked about noting in the sense of observing one by one as they occur a whole long list of wholesome thoughts or wholesome things to look at. However, that next is not the next next. It is next. The is next is to establish that first Jhana, to be able to go into it and to maintain it. And you're not there yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I have to be able to keep it ever-present.

**Speaker A:** Well, ever-present is a Western word, and it really is almost always critical in the sense of finding the times when you don't do it. And we're getting it in the sense of when we are doing it. Not when we're not doing it. When we see we're not doing, we immediately do it, and then we're doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Question is, how long is immediately? Oh, right, right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** How long does it take? And that's the skill that is developed. This is actually discussed in the suttas. It's in the Anguttara, and I think it's in the threes. And there's a reason for it to be in the reasons we won't talk about right now, but rather that the two primary skills that you have to do now is— and they work one and then the other. In other words, whenever you're not in Jhana, work for getting into it quickly. And when you're in Jhana, work on maintaining it without thinking about something else and falling out of it. That in fact, we're already on the path in the first jhana of what to do with the first jhana just by being able to maintain the first jhana. That's the first thing that we have to do is to keep noting, to keep remembering that I am watching every thought and making sure that every thought right now is wholesome. Not every thought is right or wholesome all day long, or from now on, but while we're in the first jhana, that's what we're going to do to maintain that first jhana, is to make sure that now every thought is wholesome. Yeah, this is what we go in, and in the jhana factors, this is the expression of applied and sustained thought, to apply it onto the wholesome, and then to maintain the guard of staying on the wholesome. This is the point where almost all of the students have trouble, is they're not actually able to enter into the first Jhana and abide in the first Jhana because they're still trying to establish the first Jhana. And the establishment of the first Jhana is being able to maintain it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Yeah, maintain it now, right now, always now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, whenever you're working with it, when— because it's easy to come up and then go back out, that in fact that's the, the normal condition of the mind. So if you're in the vicinity of Jhana, then it means you're going to pop in and out of it. We need to see what popping in is all about, which means getting in the vicinity of it, or another way of saying it is intentionally gathering the factors together, and that the intentionally gaining the factors together would be applying then the mind to those factors. And then once we have those factors, we're going to make sure that we're sustaining them, because that sustaining is actually a quality of it. That's what we need to start looking at first. That's in fact the first item on the list then, that if we can say what's next What's next is applied and sustained thought.

**Speaker B:** So it's sort of like the factors, you're picking them up and you're kind of holding them, and when one of them falls down, you scoop it back up. But how fast can you scoop it back up?

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, when that thought happens, that is the falling down or the unwholesome thought about something, and it can be fleeting. It can be so fleeting in the sense that it can be, let us say, the screen where you do emails. You do the same screen with the same screen colors, so you can just have a tenth of a second flash of that email screen. Do you know that you just had that flash? And can you say, aha, I saw that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Did you even catch it happening?

**Speaker A:** Okay, can you begin to catch the mind wandering away, not catch the mind having wandered away? Okay, this is what we're talking about, is catching the mind wandering away.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's while it's in the moment that it's wandering, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right, while it starts to wander, or as it is wandering, and you see that wandering immediately.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I see that one too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, because that aha has the quality of reissuing and rebringing up the pleasure, or you can think of that also as just another dopamine hit. And what we're doing here is we're sustaining a kind of level of dopamine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. But you have to keep pumping the pump. You have to keep hitting it over and over and over and over again. In the beginning, we want to practice doing that over and over and over again, at least once on the in-breath and once on the out-breath. That's why we're talking about it in the sense of Sati. On the long in-breath and Sati on the long out-breath. As we begin to get skillful with that, then we begin to apply that Sati to the mind itself so that we're watching every thought and doing it in the sense of long, deep thoughts as opposed to silly, shallow thoughts. All right, thoughts of wholesome, thoughts of, wow, this is so nice, not thoughts of, I got work to do. Because those have— I got work to do— is the hindrance kind of mind state that is unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory because you've just given yourself an assignment that's yet to be done, off into the future. That's why all of this stuff is so important about being in the present moment, because that's the whole show of all of the jhanas, is getting into easily into the present moment, and then how deep into the present moment you can get, or maybe another way of saying it is how relaxed into the present moment you can get. Relaxed and alert.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's sort of like this. I've noticed there is depths to how wholesome a thought is, or like there's certainly a distinct level where it pops from unwholesome to wholesome. But above that, there's kind of depths. So like I could have a thought about work, that normally I think was wholesome because I felt inspired and motivated to do it and that wasn't coming from what I thought was like a place of wanting to escape the present moment. But even still, that's sort of still got that subtle quality there and it can go more wholesome and in some ways I think the phenomena kind of, the way the thought expresses itself can

**Speaker A:** change a little bit. [Speaker:Dhammarato] Right, so another way that we're talking about it is while you're in that state, one of the things to do to sustain it This is to play with how wholesome can this thought be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's something I was sort of already doing, just like toying around with it sort of as a form of self-entertainment. But yeah, no, yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, how wholesome can we get this? How much Piti can we get?

**Speaker A:** Well, Not necessarily, because that kind of wholesome thought is a cause-effect that you put into it.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the thought of how wholesome can the thought be has the quality of enjoying that thought for how wholesome it is rather than getting a load of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like generating some other cause.

**Speaker A:** It's very subtle.

**Speaker B:** It is, it is, it's very tricky. Thank you for pointing that out, because that's a trap that I was falling into was was I'd feel like some strong physical euphoria, Piti, right? Right, and I try to intensify it, and a lot of times that I try to intensify it, it would actually lose it because I'd be resisting.

**Speaker A:** Because you're trying, that's exactly right. This is the whole point.

**Speaker B:** It's like so counterintuitive.

**Speaker A:** It's all about relaxation, it really is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And

**Speaker A:** you see, that goes against the whole grain of the way that we have been trained our whole lives. And it also goes on with the issue of the instincts that we have this self-preservation instinct built within, because the jungle has always been a jungle. But the problem is, is that now humanity is no longer in the jungle. They brought the jungle with them, and they did that way with their genes. In other words, our— the current genes of humanity has not caught up to the level of sophistication of our civilization. And so most people who are in this civilization are not up to, let us say, citizenship grade because they're not using their human mind. They're still stuck in their instincts as if they were still in the forest. And that instinctual thinking is the natural order of it because it takes work to use that frontal cortex.

**Speaker B:** It's like an energy maintenance.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so the reptilian brain doesn't use much effort or energy. It's just kind of always there. It's been along. I mean, the reptilian brain is the remnants of a cold-blooded animal. Everything is just as it is, you know. And then they have instant striking power, but they don't have any endurance at all. One of the things that makes a human a human is the fact that we can outlast things. 10 or 20 minutes. I really was very, very surprised at one time when I was, because of a car breakdown, I had to walk and I had to take the dog with me because I couldn't leave her in the car. This is a Great Dane, and I outwalked the Great Dane. I had to stop waiting for her because I just tired her out.

**Speaker B:** Oh my word.

**Speaker A:** And I am not up to shape, never have been or ever cared to be. But dogs just do not have the endurance to go mile after mile. In general. Now, some dogs can get up to that, but your average human and your average dog— now, the human cannot walk a dog because they don't have that endurance. And there's all kinds of things like that also that in fact, one of the secrets to alligator wrestling is because the alligator wrestlers already know that they can tear the alligator out If they can survive getting him tired out, they're already won. Which is exactly the same thing that what Muhammad Ali did.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tire them out. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. To wear out your opponent. Okay. So people who do not have a fully exercising frontal cortex can get worn out very quickly, and so they stop thinking. But then they don't like mathematics. To poor people who are curious, when they see math, they want to know exactly what that is. Am I still up to scratch on it?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, I'm following you. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, um, this whole thing then about the frontal cortex being something that needs to be exercised and put into gear intentionally over and over again so that we can take over these ordinary habitual, both habitual and instinctual behaviors that wind us being in Dukkha all the time. And one of the qualities then that we have as humans is that this is not ever good enough. We want more, we want better. And that's the problem with humanity. That's in fact, you could go so far as to say, that's the teaching of the Buddha. Why do people suffer? Over not being satisfied with what they've got right now.

**Speaker B:** Desire. Yeah, desire and suffering.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's it. Comes the actual desires themselves are actually the feeling system. And he's a clear example is fear, because fear is the most basic feeling. It's the most basic feeling. And the reason and interrelationships with that is because that's the language of the self-preservation instinct. And that many times in your life you have remained alive because you did not go do something what we would call stupid. But the reality is, is that you did so— you did not do something because it caused great fear in you, which is enough education, so you don't go there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So we've really— we've been trained to rely on this fear.

**Speaker A:** Well, not just trained. We wouldn't have survived from before the training. Before there was ever any training, there was instinct. That's why we call it instinct.

**Speaker B:** It's the genetics.

**Speaker A:** And it's the genetics.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that any species that goes up pureless grows up no more generations after that. They were all extinct.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah. Good point. Good point.

**Speaker A:** That fear is what causes an antelope or a giraffe to run away from and fight with lions while they're attacking. If the giraffe was just okay and everything was fine, and when the lions attack, here, have this arm. How many giraffes they have left?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** So that's like a— it's like a baby, right? I've heard this, this talked about where there's like, is a baby enlightened? Like the baby can't be enlightened because the baby hasn't gone through the process of being unenlightened yet, you know. So like the baby might just do it because it doesn't understand that the, like, I don't know, maybe like a tiger or something's dangerous.

**Speaker A:** I can imagine ordinary people would know, like, about enlightenment, would in fact have those kind of conversations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, there's probably some, a lot of misconceptions.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, now here's the point. If a very— this is out of the sutras— if a very tender infant touches with his hand or his foot a hot glowing coal, the hand will withdraw first before the child tears up and bawls. And that if you've noticed, you've had reaction times to that also, that somebody touches you, you're surprised, the knee-jerk reaction. Or what we call the startle reflex. Startle reflex comes deep, deep within the— out of the amygdala, and it controls the reflexes instantly. People literally jump.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, before you even know what's

**Speaker A:** happened, you've already like— you do not know what's happened. This is instinctual reflex, all right? And that same speed of that instinctual reflex is the kind of things that will happen also in the mind that will start pumping you full of fear and you can't figure out why. Where did this anxiety come from?

**Speaker B:** Do you need to match that level of speed with your wholesome thoughts to sustain sort of what we might call like a permanent state of enlightenment?

**Speaker A:** Well, no, we're not looking for a permanent thing. Right, right. But the skill that we're looking for developing is the skill of Sati, to remember, because your natural state of mind is being asleep. And here you're saying, I want to stop nature. No, what you want to do is become friends with your nature.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And to wake up to it and to keep waking up and to keep waking up. And even though you've woken up 10,000 times, the next time you wake up, you don't fuss at yourself for having gone back to sleep. That's the natural state.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** When you wake up in the morning, when you wake up in the morning, do you beat yourself with a belt because you had slept during the night?

**Speaker B:** No, no, of course not.

**Speaker A:** When you get hungry, do you take a knife and slit your stomach open in revenge for having hunger pains?

**Speaker B:** No, no, that would be ridiculous. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, you know, these instincts are going to be there. It's not that you're going to destroy them, it's that you're going to conquer them with friendship.

**Speaker B:** I love it, man. I love it. That's, that's, it's so true. It's so true. Because as soon— and, and I noticed this in my satsangs over the last 4 days— it's as soon, as soon as I— it's like I said before, as soon as I want to con— to, I say, concur with something other than friendship, that it just compounds the negativity even further.

**Speaker A:** Now you're beginning to see that.

**Speaker B:** It's the most like counterintuitive, like it's so, it's crazy, it's crazy, man, it's crazy. Okay, it's like what you resist persists. There's that like truism, that quote.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there is a sutta that I use that fits in with this. Directly. In fact, it is one of the key ingredients. The name of the sutta is Two Kinds of Thought, and that it is number 19 in the Majjhima Nikaya. And in there, even though it goes in great lengths talking about what is wholesome and unwholesome, is doing it in the, the singsongy Buddha kind of way. That nobody really understands, but in the sense of having thoughts that are not greedy, not ill-will, and not, let us say, harmful. And yet that harmful one, which in Buddhism you probably heard of the word Abhidhamma, Abhimsa is to refrain from doing harm. It's used in association with pañññātipāda. Now, paññā is in fact the breathing, and pāda has to do with taking the breath. So taking some breath away is what is normally concerned with killing. That's why part of the joke, Sanasia, is it's okay to eat fish because fish don't breathe.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. That's curious. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this word Abhimsa or harmlessness. If we are worried, we're harming ourselves. But when you hear that in the sutta, you kind of wonder what it is and keep going on without really going into the depths of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't take in what's just been said and the magnitude of it.

**Speaker A:** Right. Readers get into reading as the issue of the more they read, the better off they are. And what I have found is generally the suttas are in three phases. Generally, sometimes they're in a great big two-phase, and then those two phases are broken each into three pieces, which indicates that sometimes it looks like two different suttas were just sort of jammed together. That happens. But in general, there's a beginning and a middle and an end of the sutta. And that normally the first part of it is kind of the setup or the situation or the question at hand. And then the middle part of it has to do with context and whatever. And then the real zinger is dropped at the end. An example of that is, I think it's number 120, where the end of the sutta, where it ends up, is he says, oh monks, therefore do not be reborn. Well, wait a minute, what does that mean, not be reborn? Because, uh, everything that we've ever heard about rebirth in the sense of the magical, uh, or the religious way is, is that, uh, your Kamma of the past determines your future. But the Buddha in this context was actually— and the people who are translating that thinks that that's what he's meant, which means that last statement, the whole point of the sutta, doesn't make any makes sense when you're thinking about it that way. But when you think about it, that when you're harming yourself, you've been reborn as one who is harming. Hmm. Hmm. At that moment, that's what the Buddha is actually meaning in that sutta is do not do this kind of stuff. Watch what you're doing. Stay out of that kind of mentality. It's not over long periods of time. Another issue, this kind of amusing is, is that if the Buddha is talking about be here now and don't worry about the past, Doesn't he mean the deeper the past, the further back it is, the less relevant it actually is? Maybe at the absolute immediate past, so that we can see the cause-effect relationship, but the further you go back into the past, the less relevant it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that means the actual teachings of rebirth seems to have come from someplace else, because the Buddha was very specific. He only teaches one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. He does not teach magic tricks. He does not preach prestidigitation. He does not preach flying around or diving into the dirt. He does not teach, let us say, the level of stuff that Mahavir practiced. Have you ever— you haven't been to India? Perhaps you've seen movies of the Jain priest where they always carry a broom to sweep their walk in front of them, and they have been wearing masks for centuries. Why?

**Speaker B:** I haven't seen it, but they already

**Speaker A:** know that germs are in the air and that if you breathe them, it is going to be war inside your body with them. Right, right. Yeah, they've known that for centuries, you see, because the Jains are the ones who went way over the hill about non-harming. But the Buddha always takes the middle path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so they went all the way into feeling good and the bliss states and not hurting anything.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, they went all the way into trying to get there by doing good actions, by not killing anything.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, to the Karma Yoga, as opposed to the— well, they did some Jhanas, didn't they, James? I might be getting confused.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's always— back into deep history, there have been these jhana states because these jhana states are natural human states that people use from time to time. An example of that would be the two of us were out in the wilderness. I'll get back to Sutta 19 in just a moment, but we'll finish this one. They were out in the wilderness hunting and we see a boar and the boar sees us and it tears off into the thickets. And here we go. We're running and we got to keep an eye on that hog because if we lose sight of it, we'll lose him completely. And so we have to fire through the brambles and the bushes and the rabbits and everything like that. And we don't care because we're going to get that hog for dinner. Our family depends upon it, and we're after that hog and we're going to chase him down. Okay, yeah, yeah, that is very, very similar to first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's like Anapanasati. It's that flow state absorption, highly focused, you know, all of your mental faculties

**Speaker A:** need to be getting that ball. I would not use the word absorbed.

**Speaker B:** Absorbed? No. Why not?

**Speaker A:** No, absolutely not, because you got to watch where you're going. This is not some blind absorption. You've got to watch where you're going. You got to keep your eye on that thing. This is skin in the game. This is not getting lost, absorbed, flooded, underwater. This is on top.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I get what— yeah, it does, it does, it does carry those connotations. Yeah, right. Yeah, so it's like what you said before about being alert as well.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. So we can go a little bit deeper into that in the fact that there is some skills, and perhaps at that time you could say that those runners could in fact be something like a first Jhana and then something like a second Jhana in the sense that they are not distracted, that in fact you could go for this. They call it in sports, they call it going into the flow where you're really, really, really there. Absolutely. And if you start having thoughts about what's for supper, you just got a broken nose.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point is, and that's one of the reasons why good martial artists make good meditation students.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** They've already been in the position. If they don't pay attention, they just got hurt.

**Speaker B:** And you have to be relaxed as well as alert in order to have those fast reaction times, because if you're all tensed up in the ring, you won't see things.

**Speaker A:** You've already lost.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And it hurts more when your muscle is like tensed. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, not only that, when you hit, it hurts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you're all tensed up. No.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're slower and everything. Yeah. That's really cool.

**Speaker A:** So this is something to begin to understand, that these Jhana states are normal, natural human behavior. And that what happens is with meditators who are practicing wrongly, they still have these Jhana states from time to time. They kind of slip into them. It's almost like if you go hiking on the side of the mountain, the likelihood of you falling off the side is very great. And so they fall into it momentarily. It's a big splash, it's a big deal. But then they wonder how they got there and what is all of this. And it brings on confusion and whatever like that when it happens. By accident, but it's always been going on by accident because the human mind is capable of that. Here's another example of it, and that is a Formula One racer who has walked the track. He knows every inch of it. And now in the race, he's out there on that track and he's got to pay attention not just to the track, but the condition of the track and how it's changing with the other motorists on there, as well as what they're doing and whatnot like that. Now, because it's a Formula One race and it's not always as secure as the ones at Indianapolis, and those are not really. But an old lady wanders out on the track right in front of you. If you have the thought, oh lady, you ought not be here, you just killed her. Hmm. Hmm. Why? Because you're going at such a speed, you've got to pay attention to what's going on. And any extraneity, thoughts out someplace else, is going to be deadly. And guess what? A lot of racers die. Why do they die? Because they're not paying attention to what's going on. Hmm. Hmm. That the very, very best racers, the ones who watch what's going on, literally, I mean, I cannot tell you how important this point is, is that in some sports and other conditions, if that sportsman is not paying attention, he's dead. And he knows that. This is why in some cases within Buddhism you have— you heard of practice like your hair is on fire?

**Speaker B:** I have, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, this is the whole thing. And we also want to do it in the sense of being able to get ready for some of the tests that we need to take. All right, like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about, illness is a good opportunity to practice. But you could also think of it is that the entire process of this is taking lemon and making lemonade. That's the only thing that we've got to do. It's almost like a switch. Yeah, Dukkha, Anicca, Anapanasati, Arhat, Bhikkhuni. Anytime you have a choice, you can either go for the way you've been doing things or you can try something new. All right. Okay. So with this in mind, let's start into this Sutta number 19 because there's a story in it.

**Speaker B:** Arahant. That's good.

**Speaker A:** And the story is, is that there is a cowherd that is herding his cows. Now, this is ancient India. We're not talking about the Chisholm Trail. We're not talking about doggies and horses and thousands of cattle going. We're talking about just one farmer guy that's got maybe 8, 10, 12 cows. His whole life is wrapped up in those cows. Cows, and he has to get them from his pen out to pasture. But in order to do that, he has to follow a path that goes into kind of a built-up area or village where there's some food stalls, some kids playing, some stuff around like that. And so the cowherd carries a stick with him, always carries that stick, and he's going to whack a cow if the cow tries to take a piece of fruit or carrot off of somebody's stall, or if the cows are not watching where they're going and about to trample on a kid, cowherd's got to be right there in the middle of those cows so he can whack these guys. Because if he in fact just lets them go out into the village, they'll destroy the village. The villagers will be so unhappy with him that he will lose all of his cows. They'll take them. He's got no choice about it. Okay, so he's got to watch where those cows are headed. Once he gets the cows beyond that place and gets them out to pasture, the cows will now be grazing. So that means that their heads are down, and all he has to do now is to just stand and watch and guard them. He doesn't have to hit them anymore. That in fact, he can go and sit out under a tree and relax and just kind of keep an eye on them. Okay. And I think you know where this is going because it is in fact Keeping the cows in line is when we're teaching the mind to get out of the hindrances, that every hindered mind is like the cow stepping on something that it ought not be stepping on or grabbing something to eat that it ought not be grabbing for or whatever like that. And so you want to have the kind of quality of being able to whack the mind. This is also the quality of, aha, I see you, Mara. It's like, whack! You're not going to get that Oh, you stay on this path, doggy. Okay, that's the way that we look at it, is that we're going to work so that we get every thought step at a time wholesome.

**Speaker B:** And so I know what you mean with the whacking analogy, because it feels like work in the beginning. It feels like you're hurting yourself, the cows here, right?

**Speaker A:** It does, uh, because we've never, uh, actually taken control over our thoughts before. We just kind of let them happen. That even when kids are learning mathematics, they still don't have that quality of grasping a hold of the mind, of controlling the mind, of seizing the mind, or in this case with the cowherd, whacking the mind. Okay, straighten up, boy. Stand up. Let's go. Okay. And so it's a kind of a get-up-and-go quality of the right effort. And that the curious part is, is that enthusiasm has a whole lot to play with it, that if there is no enthusiasm, then the effort is great. Suppose the cowherd really doesn't want to go out today.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** And not only does he not hit the cows very well, but they don't behave very well either.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** He goes out when he's on top of the game. All right. Today, cows, we're going to do this thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, the cows kind of respect that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, so does the mind. This is why the attitude is so effective in there, and that attitude is the Samma Sanghappa. This is, uh, that's on the path, uh, and so they are actually part of the, part of the practice. And so we could say then that, um The whacking of the cows and keeping them in line is gathering together the factors of the first jhana. So that's the work that we have to do, the applying of the mind or the skill of the development of getting the mind in the first jhana means that we're going to be doing some whacking for a while.

**Speaker B:** And is that what right effort is really referring to then?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Right there in the suttas, it most specifically states it that way. Yes, brilliant, brilliant. One's right effort is to remove unwholesome thoughts and place wholesome thoughts. Most specifically, this is right there in the suttas. That's why I'm saying it's a teaching the way that I do, is because this is right out of the suttas.

**Speaker B:** Man, I need to read the suttas. I've read a lot of, a lot of Western books, but I've never read the original. I read the Vishuddhamarga. That's the only like sort of like ancient like Buddhist, part of the Buddhist canon that I've read that isn't like a 21st century interpretation. And like, there was so much like that.

**Speaker A:** It's not canon and it's not Buddhist.

**Speaker B:** Well, there was so much like magical stuff. Like, it was like, you have to sit under this particular type of tree if you're this monk. And that was like, I got like, you know, I got like a couple pages in and I started skimming around and I was like, I can't go through like 500 more pages of this. So I just sort of gave up on that, but I need to— guess what? Well, some of the suttas— I don't want to read the whole thing at once like you said.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it gets worse.

**Speaker B:** Oh man. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But let's not do the Suttimagga right now. Let's stay with what's more in line with the suttas. So as the cowherd gets out of town, out of the village. He heads towards the pasture, probably rice fields where it's got a lot of stubble as well as shafts. So it's plenty enough for the cows to eat. And while they're eating, what they're doing now is nourishing and they're being wholesome and they've got their heads down. And so now the cowherd doesn't have to sit with the cows anymore or stand there with them or hold that pole with them. All he has to do is kind of keep an eye on them. So he can go and sit under a tree and just kind of keep an eye on them and just watch them. That in fact, the issue is, is that if a cow is going to get up and go, or let us say, go someplace, he's going to raise his head and look around about where to go. So long as their heads are down, everything's okay. So that's kind of easy for them. Now, the Buddha says it's like this, is that So once we get the mind in the wholesome where the cows are grazing and we know that every cow, or in this case, every thought is wholesome, then we can begin to relax that in the sense of beginning to put some gaps in the thoughts. All right. Now, this— what we mean here is, is that in the applied and sustained The sustaining has the quality of putting gaps also in there because now it's even more relaxing. Or another way to say it is, is that now we have a whole lot more thought moments that are not dialogue or vocabulary, but now we're spending more mind moments on investigating of the actual feelings that we have already started to manipulate and take control over with the applied and sustained thoughts of the wholesome thoughts and getting ourselves into a state of Sukkha. So now the second jhana really is all about experiencing the fruit of the first jhana, which is the Piti and the Sukkha that we developed. Now we're not even going to be trying to talk. It's almost like once you get the engine running, the starter motor, once it is running, yeah, yeah, now we don't need the starter motor anymore. More.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so we don't need— it's like, I like the analogy of like a snowball. Like, once it gets big enough, it has its own momentum, it carries itself.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So, so this is what we mean then by once the thoughts are all wholesome, which is a training process. This is in fact the major training. One of the ways that I talk about it is imagine a violin that's got 4 strings: first, second, third, fourth, you know what I'm talking about. In order to play one note on that violin, you have to have the violin. You've got to have the neck and the curl and the bridge and the stops and the body of the— and the nuts and one string. So that's like what all that you need to do for the jhanas You need to do all of that in the first Jhana just to get one string going. After that, adding string or two or three, easy peasy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. It's nothing like building the whole— Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** So more than 90% of all of the work and effort, in fact, in regards to right effort, the only time there is any effort is getting into first Jhana. After that, now the effort is to stop efforting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Slow the thing down now.

**Speaker B:** And it's like, it's, yeah, it's like, it's like an event horizon of like a black hole. It's kind of like sucking you in. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So in this state, what we're doing is beginning to add gaps. Now, a normal meditator who falls into one of these states, but he doesn't really have control over the mind so that he has whole wholesome and unwholesome thoughts, any unwholesome thought that comes up is going to not only throw him out of Second Jhana, it's going to throw him out of First too, and he's back into ordinary mind. What we're looking for is the development of the First Jhana so that when we fall out of Second Jhana, we fall back into First Jhana, not back into self-gratulation. This is again why First Jhana is so important.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we don't step all the way back.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Remember that one of the qualities of the first Jhana already developed is Sukkha. You're already out of Dukkha when you get into the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** In fact, the rest of it is not necessary. It's just an interesting trip.

**Speaker B:** I love that, man. I love that mindset. That's like the exact mindset I use in my practice to get into the the first jhana, it's like treat it not as like you're going somewhere, just treat it as like you're just enjoying like the scenery. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right, because all we're going to do is just build on the joy. It's just for fun, right? Things are just going to get even more satisfied, just more relaxed, but also the relaxation has to do with the sharpness of seeing what it is to relax. And so next time we'll talk about going into Paticcasamuppada backwards in the sense of where all of this takes us, and also in regard to the actual question, what comes next? So the correct answer then to start off with is that in First Jhana, everything that you need to do is available in first jhana. But when you're doing it, you're in one of the higher jhanas in order to do it. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** That's very interesting. Everything's available to you when you're in first jhana.

**Speaker A:** But when everything is available to you in first jhana and paying attention to that particular item is what carries you into the higher jhanas. Hmm. Okay, so when we take our attention away from applied and sustained thought in first jhana, then we start paying most attention to Piti and Sukkha. Most specifically, wow, how good this feels. Wow, this is nice. That's the second jhana. All right. The analogy of it is, in fact, I'll go ahead and give you the analogies. We'll take a few moments to do that. The first jhana, the analogy is bath powder. But my grandmother made biscuits, so I used the biscuit-making thing. And that is you take the flour and then she would take her fingers and dip it into water and then sprinkle it with water so as to not get too much, just enough so that when you bring all of this together, that you have a ball of dough, that there is no place in that dough that does not have the moisture so that there's no white spots or ridges or things of dough that hasn't been absorbed with the water, nor is it dripping wet that you can't squeeze and get any water out of it. So there's that in-between place where there's just enough water, and that this is the analogy for the first Jhana. Now, the water that we're sprinkling on is all of these wholesome thoughts that we're putting into it. And we keep bringing the wholesome thoughts, and so that all the dryness of our life becomes like excellent gooey dough, and you become— mind becomes malleable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, doesn't blow away in the wind. Yes, yes, that's the amazing quality right there, is that it doesn't blow away in the wind. Because the mind is settled. It's settled into the first jhana. It's on guard.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I like to sort of rephrase things just for my own understanding. I've done that a lot of times, but also it kind of communicates to you, hopefully I understood what you said. So a way that I was kind of conceptualizing what you said though is you're making the mind malleable. It's sort of like like you're malleable means like you're more able to control it, and you're more able to control it because you like don't care as much, you know, in an attachment, like, um, you know, in an emotional attachment sense, you don't care so much about being able to control it, but that is actually what allows you to be able to control it. And that's sort of, that's, that's sort of another way to

**Speaker A:** express it. They can get really gushy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But heat makes it all dry back out again. So wet, gushy thoughts will help bring the mind together so that it becomes like that, okay, malleable. And so then the analogy for second Jhana is one that I really, really like because I've actually had one. And that is the story is, do you know what an artesian well is? They're also called springs where water just springs up out of the ground. Yeah, you know, at the foot of a hill and sometimes in certain seasons it's quite a gusher. Yeah, sometimes they're hot, sometimes like geysers will sometimes just have hot water. But we're talking about cool water, this groundwater. But because it's elevated the water table up here and then the hill comes down so that now the water springs up. So even in the time of the Buddha and the farmers who can find a place like that will dam it up, put a pond there because of this, because it's also generally sometimes seasonal, not, not all year long does that happen. But I had spring in the backyard of the neighbor that I lived in in Oklahoma, and then later I lived in in Charleston, South Carolina, where the farmer had quite a nice little pond that was like this. So this is the thing that in the sunshine, the top of the pond gets warm, the surface water gets warm, but it doesn't go all the way down because of not only the ground temperature, because of this, all this gushing water that's coming up. From— oh, and so the swimmers like to go down and swim in that turbulence because it's really exhilarating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the analogy of the first Jhana, is, is that when you get that Piti going, it's just like all over the place. I mean, yeah, yeah, can you feel? Yeah. So that's the second Jhana, is this feels so good. They're just really into it when the full-blown first, second jhana. It's not just the focus of being in the flow like the sportsman, because the sportsman, he's in danger. This is, this is completely opposite of that. It's like how good and how focused can you feel when you feel absolutely the best that you can possibly feel?

**Speaker B:** Can I ask a question about something that I've had happen a few times in the second jhana as well? I've had so much like so much Piti, especially like a really strong physical sensation of it, like, um, like sort of in my chest, a lot of like heat as well, where it's, it's, it's become like so euphoric that it's become— it's felt like it's become too euphoric. But I feel like when I have that unwholesome thought, I've already dropped back out, out of Jhana altogether.

**Speaker A:** It's sort of like— correct, that's what happens. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** It's like the— I just warned you about it. It's like so much, it's like scary. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and in fact, that's exactly what happens. And so if you're going and progressing correctly, then the way to go is into first jhana. Or if you're skilled in meditation, you can either go into third or back into the first jhana. But the beginner, when he's in second jhana, he crash lands.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, he can't handle it.

**Speaker A:** And so in the third jhana, what that means is to take the focus off of the wow-ness of how good it feels into the relaxation of how good it feels. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have a really good way of explaining these. It really simplifies it.

**Speaker A:** It's in the suttas.

**Speaker B:** It's right there.

**Speaker A:** I mean, we have Because in fact, all right, so, but in the second Jhana now, we're mostly focusing on the Piti, but we can see the Piti in the first Jhana. It's when we really begin to focus on it and taking the Piti as the object of meditation is when there's no room for thoughts anymore. I don't want to describe this, I just want to have it. All right. And so as we then take on satisfaction again, rather than the wow of how good this is, but rather, wow, this is just so nice, because that's the Sukkha that's of the quality of the third Jhana. And the analogy of that one is the lotus that's either in a pond or in a moving stream. But when it comes out of the mud, it rises up and the lotus flower opens. And it's not wet. In the second Jhana, it's like the Piti that we're talking about is the wet, the juicy. But when the flower comes in and blooms, so you can say now the third Jhana is really like the flowering of how nice is it, and it comes out of the mud and out of the, uh, the pond or out of the, uh, the flowing stream. And the lotus opens. And so the fourth jhana is defined as a shimmering, like imagine a white sheet that you put over the body so that the body becomes indistinct where you are and what you are. Then sensations that occur will be that you feel 40 feet tall or like you're flying through the air. That in fact it's in that fourth Jhana where the Mudra of touch the earth becomes useful, where you're resting your hand on the right knee, but you do it so much so that you can actually touch the ground with that middle finger just to remind yourself that yes, you still are on the ground. That's the only thing you have to do, the only movement that you make in the fourth Jhana, because that touching to remind yourself that you are not flying through the air, that you are not 75 feet tall, that you're not as big as a skyscraper, and that these are all misperceptions of the body itself. Because now what we're at, we're at that level of beginning to see what perception is really all about. So in the fourth Jhana, that's where we have the descriptions of these things, of various what we do. Like, the example is at the point of experiencing neither perception or non-perception. What that means is that you watch the consciousness trying to go into perception, that in fact you only can see consciousness itself by perceiving it. So it's turned back around on itself rather than going down the merry path. This is why it's very subtle and difficult to talk about. But also by doing this, we're changing the way that we do normally go in sequence, and that because we're not perceiving things, that means we're not telling ourselves any story. Nothing is contacting us and there is no feelings left, not even the feeling of the Sukkha. Now, this is what we mean by real equanimity. At that deep level is when really there is no place to go. There's nothing to go anywhere, but it's still sharp. Okay, so we'll talk about that kind of stuff at a later time. Right now, what you need— Absolutely, I

**Speaker B:** mean, I'm still in the first Jhana phase, you know, I haven't even got that. Yeah, that's by no means stable.

**Speaker A:** So all of this stuff is well documented. But the important point is, is that the path to enlightenment is through the first jhana, and that these other things are just kind of natural progressions of what do you do when you're in first jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So the next Buddhist teaching discussion. All right. So now what we've talked about is, is that we've talked about applied and sustained thought. We've talked about Piti. We've talked about Sukkha, and we've talked about equanimity. So now let's talk about some of the other things that we can take as objects of meditation. All right. Which is, are in fact the path factors themselves. How is my Sati? How sharp is it? How sharp is it? How fast is it? Am I really paying attention? Thanks. Okay. The next one on that.

**Speaker B:** That's a good one. Very energizing. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. How is my investigation? How is my discernment? Am I able to see what's wholesome and not wholesome? Can I tell the difference between it? Let's look at that, because right now in the first Jhana, of course we can. It's when we're off someplace else that we have trouble making that distinction. So basically, we're kind of congratulating ourselves at this level to look at— we can actually see what's going on. We start paying attention to this as a factor of enlightenment. And in fact, this unremitting Sati and unremitting investigation are now objects that need to be investigated while we're in first Jhana with the mind fit for work so that we can do this noting and investigating. That's the thing. And here is where most people had fallen down all along, including the Buddha, is that, yeah, he had first Jhana, he just— he had all of them. He just didn't know what to do with

**Speaker B:** He was looking for something to do with them. Like, he wasn't just allowed.

**Speaker A:** You are too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, 100%. Yeah, well, not always.

**Speaker A:** In fact, we always see almost everything in our lives as a means to an end.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's definitely the overriding.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's always that overriding. Well, why did we do this? Or what's the point? Or how do I feel about if I get what I want? All of that kind of stuff going on. But literally, this is nothing but just one state of satisfaction. It goes deeper and deeper and deeper into just more satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** It's like, it's like this is yet another way I like to conceptualize it, I guess. Well, I say like to, but It's not how I'd normally phrase it, but it's kind of like you're doing it for its— well, I've heard it phrased this way. I guess I do, Lexi. It's like doing it for its own sake, sort of like there's no reason for it. It's like reasonless happiness, would you say? Sort of like you're doing it without a reason to do it. It's just sort of like for the sake of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you're not doing it for the sake of anything, that in fact it's the baseline bottom state that was already there. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's more like a non-doing than a doing, or like a stopping of doing.

**Speaker A:** I think I've heard that before. So Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has a book, and the name of the book that you can find online is Hunger and Happiness. Where he talks about this most specifically. And the first thing that we have to do is to understand what hunger is and what is happiness. So imagine that you were in the desert and you'd run out of water and you're thirsty. This is possibly your last day. And you just climb just another sand dune and you look down and there's a real oasis, a real one. You know it's real. It's not a massage because this oasis has camels and Puja Gucci dancers and pond of water and palm trees and all of that. And so you take off running down there with great anticipation. Oh, we've made it, right? As we're approaching the water, that's what we call anticipation. And we can call it excitement, or it is the knowledge that I'm about to get what I want. Hmm. Okay. And so that's kind of a fulfillment, knowing that you're going to get what you want. But then later what happens is you put your face in the water, you drink as much as you can, and you roll over on your back. Back in the shade of a palm tree and relax. Now there's a difference. There's a main difference, a big difference between running down the hill to get the water and being satisfied because you've already got it.

**Speaker B:** They're both sort of what I would, I guess, now think of as like first Jhana feelings, like the overriding attitude is is like positive and optimistic, but there is, yeah, there's a very big difference between the two.

**Speaker A:** All right. So for the beginner, though, it still has that quality of in the process of getting filled. But real happiness is so happy that we don't want anything. It's like the difference between being hungry, ordering a meal and eating it versus not bothering to order food because you don't want any food.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like what you were saying before with the depth of the wholesomeness of the thoughts. It can be still over that sort of like that first Jhana threshold of wholesomeness where it kind of flips over and it's wholesome, but there's depths and there's subtleties there and we might even be unconscious of them, like we might think, you know, that me being super motivated and maybe like like, I'm really motivated, so I'm really focusing on— like, I can't remember the Pali word for it you used, but it's like seeing how fast you can, you can like be refreshing that sort of that refresh rate of that first Jhana, right? And, and we might, we might, we might even think that's like, that's like the best. But, but thinking it's the best, that's like a subtle unwholesomeness, because now you're implying something's better than other things. Then there's, you know, it's like even if, even if you're being the best now, well what happens when you fall out of it inevitably, right? Now, oh, it's not the best anymore, right?

**Speaker A:** And so staying with, wow, this is nice, that's a good way of saying this is nice.

**Speaker B:** That's brilliant, man.

**Speaker A:** Nice. Yeah, that's, that's actually the statement of the first jhana. This is nice. Because see, in the second jhana, you don't even say this is nice. And so about the last thing that happens then with that first Jhana is that as the mind gets more collected, we first start off in wholesome and we remain wholesome, but we begin to corral the mind into smaller and smaller places so that we can get it down to maybe like a poem that we repeat over and over and over again that we like. And an example of that, which is actually not a bad meditation, is just keep going over and over and over again, was the Night Before Christmas. And all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even an Anagami. Nobody would care, and St. Nicholas would soon be there. And on my kerchief, and I, mine, or cap, and had just settled down for a long winter's nap, when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Matter. Okay, now I'm going to cut it off there. I can go on with it, but let's, um, let's stop because there's other things that we can say. And one of them that is often used is: And so that one's another one. Now, and we can get it in a sing-songy way because those kind of things are long enough, you have to keep thinking through and keeping your mind on it and doing it over and over and over again. And so these are very good things that get the mind right into first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, it's satisfying as well when it's got like a sing-songy— oh, it's so satisfying. You get into it. It's really encouraging for the mind. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, you saw.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But I was getting into it too.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So then as we do that, we begin now to get the mind so that it's only on that one little point. We can then go down to a mantra length so that we're just repeating the mantra over and over and over again. But we do it with the same joy, the same gusto, the same, wow, this is really great. An example of that would be 'bu' on the in-breath and 'do' on the out-breath. This is from Northeast Thailand. 'Bu-do' is the mantra. But that's the only thing that we've got. That's the only thought that's left is the thought 'bu' on the in-breath and 'do' on the out-breath. Now the mind is actually quite stable. That's almost to the point that the cowherd has now put the cows in the pasture and it's time for him to go sit down. Because if you can go for bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath, and then let that out-breath extend, then you don't say bu on the next in-breath. You leave it silent. And when that happens, wow, how nice it is! You can actually stop the mind. In fact, almost every time when somebody goes into Second Jhana, the first thing they do is pop right back out of it so that they can congratulate

**Speaker B:** That's it. That was my experience, man. That was my experience. I was like, the first time I got second Jhana, it's kind of a funny story actually, just because it's so like, I don't know if it's a cliché, but it sounds like it could be. I just had like an emotional meltdown, like I was really tearing up and stuff, because I was dealing with like some mental health issues, and I was like, and I really wanted to get spiritual enlightenment, like the final enlightenment, so that I could just not have to do anything and exert any effort for it, right? I'd given up on that.

**Speaker A:** You didn't need any enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** It was right after I'd had this meltdown so hard that I just completely gave up on my dream at the time of becoming enlightened, that I actually got like the second Jhana for the first time. And what it was like, I went in and then I popped back out and I was like, like, that's crazy. I wish I could go into that, but I could still be me while I'm enjoying it, you know, instead of like losing sort of my sense of self so significantly, like such a huge portion of it.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, one of the best ways to understand self is by noticing the difference between these Jhana states, which has no self in it, it just has experience, and the ordinary state, which has the subject of self is because it's the self that does the suffering. If there's no self, who's going to suffer? You can almost think of it as Dukkha needs a bucket to be carried in to get here. Hmm. Hmm. That, that is— they go hand in hand. They are the same thing. Here's another way of saying it, is that if you are, or if someone is clinging to something, the clinging requires a clinger as well as that which is clung upon, which we call the cling-on if you're into Star Trek.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So there's the clinging, the clinger, and the cling-on, and we cling on to things by the self. The self is what does the clinging. That's the arising of the self, is that which is created in order to do the clinging. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Or is that exerting that painful effort? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. It's the me that has the pain. Clear example of that: you look out the window and you see a fire, and you become curious. You go look and you see it's a car on fire, and then you become more curious, and then you see it's your car on fire, and now it's not curiosity anymore, it's panic. My car, my car. And so when that self comes in, that's when the pain comes in, because it's the self that has the pain, and we have been creating Another way of saying it is that the self-preservation mechanism is kind of like a jack-in-the-box, and when the button is pushed, the door opens and out pops the self.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, it's like a little reaction. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little triggers and then the thought pops up. It's like that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so it's too much Piti, it

**Speaker B:** just like pops his head out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So we do that, we create a self, and you can begin to watch that happening. But it is better if you can watch it happening from the first Jhana, because that is in fact the development of the first Jhana, is watching this stuff come up as hindrances, the selfishness. So in the sustaining of the first Jhana, that's when we actually, by failing to maintain the first Jhana, is when we actually get our education. Because still the mind is so sharp that it can see what happened. We went down a rabbit hole, but now we can see the going down the rabbit hole rather than having it blindly. Then we say, wait a minute, I'm not going in there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Pull it back out, or you can get swallowed into it. But this is part of the skill that is developed of this applied and sustained thought, or being able to sustain the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of interesting because it's almost like the way you get out of it, it's kind of like the same way you got into it. I don't know if you've heard of the like, don't think about pink elephants. Like, it's like a phrase, it says don't think about pink elephants. And then all you can think about is pink elephants. And so it's similar. It's like, it's like, don't think about like, like suffering or something. But then all you can think about is suffering. But now you're mindful of it. You can't— you're seeing it every time it's happening, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, there's even a better way for the teacher to do it. And that is the elephants aren't pink, that you're the one who sees it pink. And you just saw it pink again.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I know.

**Speaker A:** But don't you think the elephants are not pink?

**Speaker B:** I'm trying to force them gray. They keep flickering back and forth.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the mind. It comes and goes like that. Okay, so begin to see it that way. That's why that kind of phrase is there, is so that the person who's listening to that can recognize that yes, they did think about the elephant, even though they didn't want to. They were coaxed into it, or that it was a hole that we fell into, or

**Speaker B:** some— there was some slipperiness to it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we can now see that process and begin to see that imagery as it pops instantly into mind. Then, in fact, how quickly can you pass back and forth between gray and pink and gray and pink and gray and pink and gray and pink?

**Speaker B:** It's kind of weird because I've tried to do an exercise like that before, and sometimes I guess the more effort I apply, it's like it— Oh, but

**Speaker A:** you're still wanting something out of it. I'm just playing. But the point that I was making is just get a load that the mind flips back and forth and here you are trying to get something out of it, making it faster or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, like as an exercise to like see how fast I can notice like two sensations at once or like, because it seems to flick back and forth, right? It's like something gets stuck in the cogs a little bit. It. If I don't know, there's like, there's like a, there's like a point. It keeps happening that I don't know if you've experienced that.

**Speaker A:** But well, there's my decision. What I'm recommending, though, is just to look at all of what's going on, including the fact that you want to make it faster.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** That you're still wanting stuff, that this is the part that we need to look at, that in fact, that's how the distinction between wholesome and unwholesome is, is that the wholesome parts because we want something.

**Speaker B:** Oh man, you know, I called out the mind for the same thing and then I, the mind, like fell into it. I did that earlier in our conversation. I was like, you know, for example, you're flying loads of speed and you think it's like the best way, and I can totally get into that, you know. It's like, yeah, I get that with work as well, like being productive, you can really get into it, but it's still That's like, it's, yeah, it's, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so what we're here practicing, and you can practice it right now with me, is practicing that really everything's already okay. We don't have to get anything. Like the Zen tell the Zen students, the Zen master says you're already enlightened, just sit here.

**Speaker B:** He's got a point.

**Speaker A:** Just sit. I mean, just enjoy your moment. That's the whole point of the first jhana, is just to sit. And can you continue just to sit and enjoy?

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point of like all four paths, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** And yet here we are, trained in our society to get something, to attain something, to attain jhanas, to get this stuff, to get Sotapanna, to get enlightened, to get Arahant, to get a Nibbana. As if it were a goal to have. That if there's any goal that's not a goal at all, then in fact you can think of a goal as how hot you can get something, then Nibbana is to stop trying to see how hot you can get something and leave things alone. That's Nibbana. That in fact the actual word means just to chill. Maybe just chill. Don't have to want anything. I don't need Nibbana. I have to chill, warning Bhavana, just chill.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's funny that like chill is like a slang word in English, but it is sort of like a cold versus a hot kind of, kind of, um, like a cold versus hot.

**Speaker A:** It is in all languages, and it was in the time of the Buddha also. That's what the word was used for. It has also the quality of domesticated animals like dogs don't bark because they're Dhamma, or that when you take food out of the oven, like a pizza pie or something, you take it right out of the oven, it's too hot to eat. You got to let it cool off a bit and then you can eat it. That's in the Nibbana, okay? So all you have to do is come out of your own mental oven and you can just chill.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, you can cool off while it cools off.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just, just, just, uh, you know, turn the gas off or turn the heat off. Stop thinking about anything. But wanting to chill is stoking the fire.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's, it's so counterintuitive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, wanting to chill stokes the fire. You're all— you don't need to chill. You're already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got— that's the speed, man. That's the speed. That's the speed. That's the speed. It's so fast. Yeah, yeah. I want to chill and I just lost it so fast. I didn't even know it happened, man. I didn't even know it. That's why, like, my reaction was so big.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Okay, so go practice, go play with this. Now you have some new toys today to play with.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hell yeah. Perfect, man. Brilliant. Brilliant. I'm loving this. I'm loving this, man. I'm learning a lot. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So we'll see you again.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** And you're good to go right now.

**Speaker B:** I'm going to go meditate right now, man.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, ciao. Have a great day. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student (Speaker B), is a detailed and practical guide focused on establishing and deepening the first *jhāna* (meditative absorption) as the foundation for the entire path. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: "What's Next?" is the Wrong Question**
The student asks, "Where do we go from here?" Dhammarato reframes this: the path isn't about rushing to the next stage, but **deepening your skill where you are**. If you're not stable in your current stage, "next" is just repeating the same lessons. True progress comes from fully establishing the foundation.

### **The Foundational Skill: First Jhāna**
The entire talk centers on the **first jhāna** as the critical, non-negotiable base. Everything else builds from here.
*   **What it is:** A state of stable, wholesome mind where every thought is intentionally wholesome (free from greed, ill-will, and harm). It is characterized by **applied and sustained thought** (*vitakka* and *vicāra*) on a wholesome object.
*   **The Analogy of the Cowherd (from MN 19):** This is a central teaching tool.
    *   **In the Village:** The cowherd must actively "whack" his cows (the mind) with a stick to keep them from causing trouble. This is the initial **right effort**—vigilantly correcting unwholesome thoughts and applying wholesome ones. It feels like work.
    *   **In the Pasture:** Once the cows are grazing peacefully (the mind is consistently wholesome), the herder can relax under a tree, simply watching guard. This is the sustained, settled first jhāna.
*   **The Two Key Skills of First Jhāna:**
    1.  **Getting In Quickly:** The skill of noticing an unwholesome thought and *immediately* replacing it with a wholesome one. "How long is *immediately*?" This speed is the skill to develop.
    2.  **Staying In (Maintaining):** The skill of sustaining that wholesome focus without being pulled out by distraction. This is not about a forced, permanent state, but about noticing when you've wandered and gently returning—**"waking up"** over and over without self-criticism.

### **Crucial Insights and Corrections**
*   **It's About Relaxation, Not Force:** The mind becomes malleable and controllable not through tense effort, but through **relaxed, alert familiarity**. Trying to intensify pleasurable feelings (*pīti*) often backfires because it involves striving and resistance.
*   **Depth of Wholesomeness:** Even within wholesome thoughts, there are subtle depths. A thought like "I'm motivated to work" may be broadly wholesome but still contains a subtle future-oriented desire. Deeper wholesomeness is more about contentment in the present—"This is nice"—without an agenda.
*   **First Jhāna is a Natural Human State:** It's compared to the "flow state" of an athlete, a hunter, or a race car driver—**fully alert, present, and absorbed in the task**, not in a dull trance. This demystifies *jhāna*.
*   **The Goal is Not to Destroy Instincts, But to Befriend Them:** Our instinctual, "reptilian" brain (e.g., fear, desire) is part of our nature. The path isn't to eradicate it but to **use the human frontal cortex to wisely manage it** through mindful friendship, not war.
*   **Everything You Need is in First Jhāna:** The path factors (mindfulness, investigation, energy, etc.) can all be developed and examined from within the stable platform of the first *jhāna*. Higher *jhānas* are natural progressions of attention, not separate goals.
    *   **Second Jhāna:** Shifting focus from the *application* of wholesome thought to the **joy/rapture (*pīti*)** that has arisen.
    *   **Third & Fourth Jhāna:** Moving into deeper **contentment (*sukha*)** and then **equanimity (*upekkhā*)**.

### **The Ultimate Perspective: "Just Chill"**
Dhammarato concludes by connecting this to the ultimate goal:
*   The self is a construct that arises with clinging and suffering. In *jhāna*, the sense of self diminishes, and with it, suffering.
*   **Nibbāna (Nirvana)** is framed not as a distant trophy to attain, but as the natural state of **"chilling"**—extinguishing the fires of craving and becoming satisfied with the present moment.
*   The paradox: **"Wanting to chill stokes the fire."** The practice is to see that you are already okay, and to relax into that understanding.

### **Practical Instructions Given**
1.  Use **breath-based mindfulness** (*ānāpānasati*) as a primary tool, connecting a wholesome thought or simple mantra (like "bu-do") to the in-breath and out-breath.
2.  Practice **noting** thoughts as wholesome or unwholesome with increasing speed and precision.
3.  Use **poems, mantras, or repetitive phrases** to calm and unify the mind into first-*jhāna* stability.
4.  **Play with the mind** in a relaxed way. Explore "how wholesome can this thought be?" without turning it into a striving exercise.

In essence, the talk is a masterclass in **building the foundation**. It redirects the student from goal-oriented striving to the meticulous, joyful craft of cultivating a continuously wholesome and present mind, starting with the first *jhāna*. The path is revealed not as a linear climb, but as a deepening into the satisfaction and clarity already available in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this detailed conversation about meditation practice and the path to enlightenment, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (the teacher) to illustrate the teachings:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Cowherd and His Cows (from Sutta 19, Majjhima Nikaya)**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The process of training the mind, especially in **First Jhana**.
    *   **The Story:** A cowherd must vigilantly guide his cows with a stick through a village to prevent them from causing damage (eating from stalls, trampling children). Once in the pasture, the cows graze peacefully, and he can relax under a tree, simply keeping watch.
    *   **Application:** The "village" represents the world of distractions and unwholesome thoughts. The "stick" and vigilant whacking represent **Right Effort**—actively correcting the mind, noting unwholesome thoughts ("aha, I see you, Mara") and replacing them with wholesome ones. The "pasture" represents the established **First Jhana**, where the mind is naturally wholesome and the practice shifts to relaxed, sustained guarding.

2. **Building and Sustaining Momentum**
    *   **The Snowball / Engine:** Once a snowball is big enough, it has its own momentum. Once an engine is started, you don't need the starter motor anymore.
    *   **Application:** This illustrates the transition from the strenuous effort of establishing **First Jhana** (applying the thought) to the easier task of **sustaining** it once it's stable.

3. **The Violin**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The disproportionate effort required for **First Jhana** compared to the subsequent jhanas.
    *   **The Analogy:** 90% of the work in making a violin is building the entire instrument (body, neck, strings). Once it's built, playing additional notes or strings is relatively easy.
    *   **Application:** All the foundational work (Right Effort, mindfulness, overcoming hindrances) is done to achieve **First Jhana**. Progressing to deeper jhanas is a natural and simpler progression from that stable base.

4. **Depth of Wholesomeness / The "Best" Trap**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The subtlety of clinging and desire even within wholesome states.
    *   **The Analogy:** A thought can be wholesome, but there are "depths." Trying to make it "the best" or most euphoric is a subtle form of craving and control, which is actually unwholesome and causes you to lose the state.
    *   **Application:** The goal is not to intensify pleasure (Piti) but to relax into satisfaction (Sukkha). Seeking "the best" is a future-oriented desire that takes you out of the present moment.

5. **The Instinctual vs. Human Mind**
    *   **The Reptilian Brain:** Described as a remnant of a "cold-blooded animal" with instant striking power but no endurance. It operates on instinct (like fear) and habit with little energy.
    *   **The Human Frontal Cortex:** Requires intentional effort and energy to use, but provides endurance and higher reasoning.
    *   **Application:** Meditation is the exercise of the "frontal cortex" to take over from the instinctual, fear-based "reptilian" patterns that cause suffering (Dukkha). We are "bringing the jungle" with us via our unchecked instincts.

6. **Absorption vs. Alert Flow**
    *   **The Hunter and the Boar / The Formula One Racer:** These are counter-examples to the common misconception of jhana as passive absorption.
    *   **The Analogy:** A hunter chasing a boar or a racer on a track must be hyper-alert, focused, and relaxed to react instantly. A moment of distracted thought (e.g., "what's for supper?" or "that lady shouldn't be there") leads to disaster.
    *   **Application:** **Jhana is a state of relaxed alertness**, not a dull trance. It's a "flow state" where total focus in the present moment is essential. This is why martial artists often make good meditators.

7. **Nibbana as "Chilling"**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The ultimate goal is not an attainment but a cessation of craving.
    *   **The Analogy:** Taking a hot pizza out of the oven. You must let it **cool off (Nibbana)** before you can eat it. Wanting to chill *right now* is like stoking the fire.
    *   **Application:** Enlightenment (Nibbana) is the natural, cool state when the "heat" of craving and clinging is turned off. The paradox is that wanting to achieve this state is itself a form of craving that prevents it.

### **Jhana-Specific Analogies (from the Suttas)**
Speaker A references the traditional similes from the Pali Canon:

*   **First Jhana:** Like making a **ball of dough** by kneading water into flour until every part is perfectly, uniformly moist—neither dry nor dripping. This represents the mind saturated with wholesome thought, becoming malleable and unified.
*   **Second Jhana:** Like a **cool, spring-fed pond**. The water gushes up from below (the joy/Piti of the first jhana) and fills the pond. A swimmer can enjoy the invigorating turbulence. This represents the mind immersed in the joy born of concentration, with applied thought stilled.
*   **Third Jhana:** Like **lotus flowers** in a pond, saturated with water but not dripping. They have risen clean from the mud. This represents the mind saturated with happiness (Sukkha), where the more exuberant joy (Piti) has faded into a serene, pervasive contentment.
*   **Fourth Jhana:** Like a person sitting covered from head to toe with a **pure white cloth**, so that no part of their body is uncovered. This represents the mind in a state of pure, bright equanimity and mindfulness, purified of all pleasure and pain.

### **Other Key Stories & References**

*   **The Tired Great Dane / Alligator Wrestling / Muhammad Ali:** These stories illustrate the **human advantage of endurance** (of the frontal cortex) over raw, instinctual power. The path requires patiently "tiring out" our habitual negative patterns.
*   **The Infant and the Hot Coal:** From the suttas, it illustrates the **speed of instinctual reaction** (withdrawing a hand before feeling pain). This is compared to the speed at which unwholesome mental states (like anxiety) can arise from deep conditioning.
*   **Hunger and Happiness (Biscuit-making & the Oasis):**
    *   **Biscuit Dough:** Reiterates the First Jhana dough analogy.
    *   **The Oasis:** A man dying of thirst in a desert sees a real oasis. The **anticipation and running** towards it is like the craving for happiness. The **deep satisfaction after drinking and resting** in the shade is like true happiness (Sukkha/Jhana). The key difference is between *wanting* and *having*.
*   **"Don't Think of a Pink Elephant":** Used to illustrate how the mind works—the very act of trying to suppress a thought reinforces it. The skillful approach is to simply **observe** the mind's flipping between states (pink/gray) without trying to control it.

### **Summary of Metaphorical Themes**
The talk uses metaphors to convey that:
*   **Meditation is a skill of friendly vigilance,** not violent suppression (Cowherd, Friendship with Nature).
*   **The mind has inertia** and must be patiently guided until it finds a new, wholesome equilibrium (Snowball, Engine, Violin).
*   **Jhana is a natural, alert state of flow,** not a passive trance (Hunter, Racer).
*   **The deepest trap is subtle craving,** even for spiritual states ("the best" thought, wanting to chill).
*   **The goal is a natural cooling off** from the heat of desire, not the attainment of a new, exciting state (Pizza, Nibbana as chill).
