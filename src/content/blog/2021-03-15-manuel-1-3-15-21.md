### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And Jeff is joining too. Great, big crowd today. Hello, Jeff, welcome.

**Speaker B:** Hi all, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we had just started and just turning the video recorder on so that we can, um, talk about a story, and we can make this a general discussion, and people can ask questions about it and whatnot, both as we go along and after we finish the story. So the story is in pictures. There are 10 of the pictures, Zen art, and it's actually the topic is ox herding. And that the first picture is of the individual figuring out that something is there, something is not quite as we would expect it to be. There's something to be seen here. And then the second one is, is that he goes actively out looking for it. And this is the beginning of the spiritual journey. And then the third is, is that he gets— he catches sight of the ox. And that's when we begin to practice correctly, is when we get sight of the ox. But then the fourth one is the place where all so many students get stuck, and that is, is when we try to put a ring in the nose of the ox. And drag it around, trying to force it to go where we want it to go, to learn to control it in the critical-minded kind of way that most meditators approach. And then the next picture is a picture of making friends with the ox, to actually become— to pet the ox, to play with the ox. Now, one of the questions that we can ask here is, is that what's this ox? Who is the ox? Where is the ox? And we can think of that ox as parts of our own mind, that one way we can look at the ox is that it's the parent ego state or it's the set of laws, rules, and rituals. It's the authority. And that's one way to look at it, because an ox is really strong. Authority, that kind of way. Another way to look at the ox is that it's actually the child inside of each one of us, or it's the reptilian brain, or it's the more primitive part. And that this seems to fit a little bit better, that the ox is actually our inner child. And when we try to struggle with that, it's always going to rebel. In fact, the normal state of the mental condition of the Western person is, is that their inner child is in a state of rebellion, that we don't like what's going on, we don't like the situation that's been presented to us, we don't like getting ordered around, we want to play with our toys and we can't because we got all this work that we've been told to do. And so we get into a state of rebellion. Okay, so then we operate in that same way in our practice of meditation. So that we struggle on the inside, we fuss at ourselves. When mindfulness comes and we check to see that our mind has wandered away, we get unhappy and uptight, thinking that, oh, this ox should be doing what it's told to do. So we have to make a big change in there and start making friends with it, that if If we're going to have our mind become completely integrated, then it has to be a friendly integration. Okay. And that integration is a friendly integration. If it's not friendly, it's not going to be an integration. It's going to be an internal war, an internal conflict. And so Making friends with the ox then would be the step 5 of that. And then step 6 is learning to play with the ox, to ride the ox, to enjoy the state of mind that we've gotten created. And then another picture along the way is the going home, that he rides the ox back to town. And then the next one is, is when he, because of the integration within the mind, because he's now at home, there is no longer any need for the ox. The ox kind of disappears. There's nothing left of it. And in that regard, we can think of it, well, that means that it's more like the parent ego state. Because the parent ego state kind of disappears when we stop giving ourselves orders and rules and laws and things to do and whatnot like that, and just start living a natural, wholesome life so that the child within can be well nurtured, well taken care of, and feels supported. And so the ox kind of disappears in both of the cases of either the parent or the child, because the child is no longer needed. Sati, because it's no longer being beaten up by the parent, that it's being nurtured. And then at the end of this story is a picture of an old fat man, in fact, the image of Hoi Toi. And Hoi Toi is just returning to the village, just having fun and spreading his joy. And this shows the final integration. And so this is the story of one's Noble Path, if we practice correctly, but that the place that most students get stuck is at step 4, when they're not making friends yet with the mind. We're trying to control it in a rough sort of manhandle kind of way, rather than a very gentle, soft way. A really clear example of that is in the expression of trying to herd cats. Well, you don't herd cats. What you do is you get a great big bowl of food and wave it around, around them, and they'll follow you anywhere. But herding cats means that you're trying to drive them, you're trying to push them. And so we recognize that we rebel against that drive and against that push, and that that's the problem with, let us say, spiritual organizations that wind up being a long-term boot camp, or where the The days, everybody gets up at 4, everybody chants, everybody sits for meditation. I mean, they just turn the whole place into a retreat. And I've seen students, in fact, not fit well within that routine of a long-duty, long-term retreat. And many people think, especially if those retreats are held at a wat or at a temple, that the retreat setting that they find themselves in is the way that the monastics live their lives. And some monastics do. Some monastics live their life as if they were in a retreat with all the rules and all of that, pushing and pushing and pushing their ox. Which is constantly rebelling.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I actually have a question about that. Are there any good retreats, quote unquote, in the US that wouldn't be as pushy and like kind of against the natural flow of things, you might say? Because I've been wanting to go to a retreat this next year. But I have wondered if it's going to be too restrictive and I might just be better off booking a week in a cabin on my own or something.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you're coming around to it, that the Buddha did not say go to a retreat, pay $2,000 for a 10-day retreat. The Buddha didn't say that. He said go to the forest. Go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw. Those four things are mentioned in many suttas, including our old favorite, the Anapanasati Sutta. But it's in a lot of places. It's also in Sutta Number 38, that this is the natural progression, that in fact the going off on one's own is to go in search of the ox. But when we find the ox— yeah, somebody's just put it up, the 10 ox herding pictures. That's exactly what we're talking about here. Okay, so let's take that down so we can see to everybody again. All right, great. Thank you. Yes, that's the story that we're telling. And the question is about retreats, because retreats, the way that they're going, tend to get students stuck in that step 4 of struggling and making it hard work. That in fact, Kishon has experienced that too, that it's better just to get away from everything The— there's two issues, and that is the issue about seclusion and the word retreat, because the word retreat— I don't even know why they would use the word retreat other than that would be a common word that's used within Christianity. But we also have the quality of the word retreat. I mean, at least I do. I was in the Navy. I was a bugler in the Navy. And one of the— I mean, I mostly I played taps because of funerals, but there was also retreat. And retreat means something. It means that you are a failure and that you are leaving the battle scene to save what's left of your disaster. Now, sometimes people think of a retreat like that. In fact, a lot of people go to retreat like that, as you know, withdrawing from the disaster of their life. But a much better way of thinking about it would be seclusion, to get away from it all. Now, in the retreats, they have a situation called noble silence, and that's different. That's kind of played with in a lot of different ways. Some people think that noble silence is absolute silence. Others would say that noble silence is friendly silence, that you don't ignore everyone there, you just accept everyone as they're OK. But the important thing about a retreat is that no one there is in seclusion. The seclusion is arbitrary. The seclusion is in fact a farce or a it's not real, that we have to pretend that we're in seclusion, where in fact we're not. We're in a regimentation, and part of the regimentation is to be quiet. And so getting away from it the way that the Buddha would talk about it would be that there was no real organization, but just go away from everybody else and just sit down and be with yourself. Begin to figure out where the inner ox is and begin to make friends with it immediately, rather than trying to struggle with it, to try to capture it. Rather than whenever you see it, just be friends with it. And this is how we would operate within seclusion. This would be the way that I would Currently, if we were going to do a retreat, it would be a much, much more relaxed retreat with the intention that we don't even know where everybody is because they're off someplace. Yes, Robert.

**Speaker D:** So this made me think of the Hexagram 33 of the I Ching, which is called Retreat. And here's the text: Below heaven is the mountain retreat. A noble one keeps small people at a distance. Not with hatred, but through respect.

**Speaker A:** Okay, is that it? Yes, right, exactly. So how many people then can go to these expensive retreats in the West and to do it, their silent retreat, out of respect for the other people there, rather than out of fear of The rules. Most people have trouble with those rules. You got to be in the meditation hall at this particular time of day. No excuses. You can't hang out. Uh, yes, well, that reminds me, like

**Speaker E:** When I was a little boy, I used to do stuff like when I went to a funeral or I went to stuff to places where I was supposed to be quiet. I never want to be quiet out of respect, like what Robert just read. I want to be quiet because the fear of my mom, like getting the chancla and saying, listen here, man, you gotta make silence here. And now, like right now, I can practice this noble silence that's like, yeah, I'm keeping silence for respect of the people that's grieving, from the people that are meditating, even those who are praying.

**Speaker F:** Like,

**Speaker E:** I can see this pattern that I sometimes still act like a child. From fear instead of from respect. Like, it's crazy how, how I still act by fear, not by respect or by, by noble effort.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's another way of looking at it, and that is, is that when we see it out of fear, that's because we're in a one-down position, that we see other people as authorities or as important or as bigger or as dangerous. Yeah, and that when we're seeing things out of respect, that that means at least we could see ourselves as just part of a bigger picture. We're just one of many. We're just in a group, and that the benefit of the whole group is part of my existence. Okay, that no one is an island unto themselves. And yet the meditation practice seems to be all about getting one's own mind together. But the reason that we do that is because we already have built into us the instincts that set that stuff up between one up and one down, about who's dangerous and who's not. Robert, there's a big light on your left shoulder. Can you move that light so that it's there? That's great. Thank you. We have these various parts within us that are naturally there, and they brought us, let us say, over the periods of many, many centuries of evolution. These layers have been built up to give us more and more functionality. For instance, there is very little functionality in a bacteria. There is very little functionality in a worm or a mosquito, more functionality in a snake, but not so much. And as you see it growing up, so functionality, so that the highest level of functionality is with the human. But the issue is, is that it's built in layers. And the functions of these layers are different. And that what has happened in our culture is that these layers, instead of integrating into the whole for complete functionality, these layers get in conflict with one another. So that we feel doubt, we feel like it's the right thing to do it now, and later we regret what we've done. That we're kind of a crowd inside. And the whole process of the spiritual path is to integrate all of that. But the only way that we can integrate it is because now they're friends rather than competitors or fulfilling their old roles in their old way. And a really clear example of that is the parent ego state being critical rather than being nurturing, that nurturing is better. Now, the point is, is that the psychologists have known about this for 70, 80 years. In fact, you could go all the way back to Freud. Freud knew about it in the 1890s. So we're talking about 140 years of psychotherapy. And the problem is, is that even though we know that information on an intellectual level, that integration has to be practiced over and over again because the way it's operating is, is that it's always in conflict. The example is the parent tells you to do something and then the child rebels against that, and then the parent says, you got to do it again, and then you rebel against it again. One of my favorite examples, by the way, is a meditation student watching YouTube and he has the thought, oh, I should be meditating. And then he feels bad and says, no, I don't want to meditate now, I want to watch the video. Then he has the thought again, oh, I should be meditating. And then he has the thought, no, I don't want to meditate, I want to watch the video. But now he's gotten stuck into the— he's not watching the video, he's having an internal argument instead, at least for a few moments. And so the integration would be is when that thought comes, you ought to meditate, the answer to that is Oh, thanks for the reminder. And just do it right then. And so this is the integration that we're talking about, that the ox and the individual ox hunter has to become integrated. And when they do, each one of them as an entity unto itself kind of disappears into this old, bad, happy man that's just hanging around with no place to go and nothing to do. Yes, Robert.

**Speaker D:** You know, this reminds me of a conversation we had a few months ago when I was talking about how when I started sorting out a lot of my relationships, my family and stuff like that, that it became much easier to actually concentrate my mind in meditation. And I think this goes to show that when you sort out your relationships with others, that brings unification of mind too. And I think that's a really important point.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's part of it. Yes, Andrew.

**Speaker F:** Along these sort of same lines, I can actually share an example of something that's been unfolding in my own life over these last couple of days that kind of relates to all this that we've been talking about. I had a conflict with my father where I said something and he didn't like the emotion that was in it, and so he used it as an excuse to ignore the content of what I was saying. And so then I realized that that was like an old pattern in our family, that there was something I would want to express and then the parents would be put off by the intensity of the expression and ignore the whole thing.

**Speaker A:** Ignore the content.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, which would then just increase the intensity of this thing that's like, no, this needs to be seen, which would then just continue this cycle of push-pull. And so then I realized even, and so I was talking to them, I was like, there's a way that you can say like, hey, I don't like the way that this is being expressed, but I also, like it's clear that you have strong feelings and I care about that. And then I realized like, oh wait, that pattern's made its way inside and I'm not doing that to myself either, where when there's this sort of like upwelling of like that strong like raw emotional reaction to it, I view that as a problem and I try and like, oh, what do I do to get that to go away? And so the thing that I was saying that sort of started this conversation about the Arhat is like that in these last couple of days since my last conversation with Dhammarato, I've been like just seeing that like those sort of like childlike raw emotions coming up and instead of like trying to figure out how trying to solve it or being annoyed that it's there. It's like, oh, like, yeah, I see you. I'm going to be compassionate with you, and I'm just going to witness that you're there and that you have these strong feelings, and that's okay. And that's, you know, I'm still kind of training that habit, but already it's been a real game changer.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the funny thing about it is, is that if we have a particular emotion or feeling and we don't like it and try to push it away, it actually gets bigger. An example of that is just the easy one would be anxiety. If you feel anxiety and you don't like it, then you want to get rid of the anxiety. The feeling of wanting to get rid of something is the feeling of fear, which is anxiety itself. So by not liking anxiety, we make it worse. It stays, it sticks, because the kind of thoughts that we're having about the anxiety are anxiety producing thoughts, where in fact the whole point is we want it to go away. And we can recognize again that the— there's an expression, by the way, Andrew, and that is the medium is the message. Do you know what I mean by the medium is the message? In other words, with your family, the way that you spoke to your family, the way that you spoke to your dad, was what he picked up on, not the words. In other words, the message that he got was the medium that you gave it him. He did not get the content of the message. He got the medium. Right. Well, that's exactly what we do on the inside. The message is don't be anxious. But that's the message. But the medium keeps the anxiety going. Right.

**Speaker F:** And I feel like the most interesting thing about that is like probably like the reason that I reacted so strongly because of some perceived like, need not being met from him was because, like, I already wasn't, you know, like, if I had been attending to my own emotions and not viewing them as a problem, then when someone else did it, it wouldn't have been such an issue.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. That's why it's so valuable. And what we would call wise action is to think out what we're going to say, rather than blurting something out. That the blurting something out is almost always done out of instinct. It's either blurted out in the parent or it's blurted out in the child. But we blurt things out without thinking about it. And so this is basically what we can say is, is that we actually have three parts of the mind, and these three parts of the mind were developed historically in an order. And so the most primitive part of the mind is the one who does the least amount of processing, but it does come up with an answer instantly. Okay, that we do have programming that's built in to give instant reactions. Those instant reactions are mostly wrong, but they're almost always instantly reacting in the sense that it's in the favor of self-preservation. In other words, we jump to avoid danger. But in our society, what's happened is, is that instantaneous jumping to avoid danger is ill thought out, that it's too natural or it's too primitive. And so what we need to do is to slow down the process so that we don't give an initial reaction But we begin to give a more intelligent answer instead. Okay. So what we can do then to be on guard is, is to be on guard for blurting out when somebody says something. Wait, don't respond to anybody for anything until you get your mind cleaned back out and then respond. Even if it's a bit of time. But normally we blurt things out because of the instinctual reaction and the instinct. And the blurting is almost always based in fear. We don't like something. We're afraid that things are going to go bad or whatever. And so this is why we blurt things out. But if we think things carefully, we can recognize, no, really what's more important is, is that I keep my good relationship with my dad. That's number one, because then with that good relationship, he can hear the bad news that I've got for him. But if I just blurt out that bad news, he's not going to be able to take it, because the message that he hears is the medium through which you gave it out. But that happens on the inside our own mind. And so if the medium is critical parent then the child's response is going to be resistance, rebellion, guilt, remorse. But if the mind, if the critical parent, the medium of the message is comforting, reassuring, never mind, start again kind of thing, then the child doesn't necessarily feel like a failure just because he's made a mistake. They're basically— that's the issue that we can say that the critical parent does, is that we treat— the critical parent treats every mistake as something that's bad, rather than seeing every mistake as a learning opportunity. If you don't make mistakes, you're not going to learn anything. So making your mistakes, that's your best teacher. But we've been trained in our society that making mistakes is bad. That it's dangerous. You make a mistake, you could die. And so we have then come to the point of thinking that we should avoid our mistakes, that we can lie about them, that we want to cover them up. If my mistakes are exposed, that means that things are going to be more dangerous. But that's the critical way of looking at it. The nurturing way of looking at it is, oh no, let's look at our mistakes. Let's see what's going on in there, make friends with it. Let's make friends with that ox. That's the only way we'll be able to ride the ox, is because the ox lets us ride. So we got to be friends with these internal parts. And so we are going— we need to change then our method of operation from being critical or being outburst. They're just like— we will have an outburst to another person. We have those same outbursts inside the mind. Arahant, you know, those kind of responses. And so the better thing to do is to note that and then to reassure ourselves, oh, it's everything's okay, I can handle that. Which then means that you're petting the ox, getting ready to climb back on and ride, never mind that you've fallen off the ox. Make friends with the ox. Don't hate the ox because you fell off of it. Get back up, make friends with it, and ride. So I thought that I'd point out that issue about the medium is the message, that the way that the message is delivered is more important than the content of the message in many cases, that we have to get those in sync. Yeah, and we have to go slow. Go ahead.

**Speaker F:** So the other part of that that was so interesting was like that the thing, the very thing that I was like pointing the finger at him for was like actually the thing that I wasn't providing for myself. And that had I, like, the more important thing was like me taking care of that dynamic within myself, and then I would have, you know, sort of the stability to allow the medium to be more gentle.

**Speaker A:** Good awareness, good insight. Oh, Robert's just sent, if you consider your thoughts emotions— I didn't catch it, it went away. Read it to us, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, sure. So this is from the creator of Internal Family System, IFS. So he wrote If you consider your thoughts, emotions, urges, and impulses to be coming from an inner landscape that's best understood as a kind of internal family populated by sub-personalities, many of whom are childlike and are suffering, then it makes more sense to take that next step of comforting and holding these inner selves rather than just observing and objectifying them. Which also reminds me— I really like that. Mahasi style and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa style, right? Because the Mahasi style is the observing and objectifying, the Bhikkhuni style is the comforting and nurturing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I would say that I'm not sure based upon things that I know about Thailand that the Thais would phrase it that way or even agree with you, but it's certainly true. That I, as I've said before, that when I was at Wat Soan Mokkh, I really did feel at home. I feel accepted. I felt like that this is the right place. I didn't feel like a stranger trying to fit in. And I had— that was the way that I felt with the Mahasi. That was the way that I felt with Goenka. Trying to fit in, trying to get into the groove here. But with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and especially Achan Po, I felt at home immediately. And I think that that's that attitude that they had for themselves, that if Achan Po had been critical with himself still, he would have not been so nurturing to me. And so that's the kind of style that I want to give to you guys, is to help you to understand that any and everything that I have gotten is because I was nurtured into it by Ajahn Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And that's my job, is to help you to see that nurturing and to take it on for yourself so that you can begin to nurture yourself, to make friends with yourself. That if we don't make friends with the self, the rest of the journey is going to be very difficult. It's going to be a struggle. Then in fact you've been struggling your whole life because you've been at war with yourself on the inside. Now it's time to become an integrated whole, but the only way to do that is by making friends. I see you nodding your head a lot, Alex.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, it just makes so much sense because for a long time I actually— Robert, nice to meet you, man. Nice to meet all of you. The only The only two people I have seen before is Christopher and Ralaz.

**Speaker A:** Nice to meet you.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, nice to meet you, man. But in the past year and a half, I think I've been doing more Mahasi style. Just go allow all my feelings, allow experience and go deeper into experience and allow it to be what it is and getting intimate with what it is to be in touch with my experience. But since that last call with you, Dhammarato, it's really helped. Like, I've been— each day I've been taking it on. I've been doing 4 to 6 sessions a day of 5 to 10-minute sits of just enjoying the be here now and enjoying the here now. And I've noticed that I can get pretty present with my breath almost like not immediately, but within about 2 to 3 minutes in. There's like, oh, wow, I'm enjoying this. This feels nice. This feels good. And I'll notice too, like, I'm starting— like, I remember what you said about mind moments. And so I'm starting to notice, like, to get myself into it, I'll be like, I'm enjoying this, I'm enjoying this breath, I'm enjoying this breath. And then sometimes what will come in there is like, 'Oh, this must be what Dhammarato was talking about,' or, 'Oh, I wonder what people at work are gonna say,' or, 'Oh, I wonder where my girlfriend is,' and like, 'Oh, I'm enjoying this breath, I'm enjoying this breath,' just bring myself right back to it. And yeah, so I've just, I've been practicing that a lot. And I've noticed that whenever I have irritation, or when something gets kind of you know, it feels solid and it feels like it's something I need to take care of right now, otherwise the world is going to end. I noticed that.

**Speaker A:** I noticed that's the next breath, by the way. Yeah, the world will end.

**Speaker G:** Well, I noticed that I can just like let it go because I know that I'm going to sit. I'm going to sit later today. I know I'm going to have another sit session. So it makes it like It's kind of like a nice little safety net that I feel like I'm cultivating for myself. But Dhammarato, I wanted to actually ask you, um, unless there was like a different way this conversation was supposed to go— I don't know if there was.

**Speaker A:** There's no supposed. We're not supposed to have supposed tos. Okay, okay.

**Speaker H:** I didn't think so.

**Speaker G:** I didn't think so. Um, but what I was gonna ask is you know, what would be like the— what's the next step? You know, if I wasn't going to talk to you for another few days, just keep doing what I'm doing, or would I add anything on top of this? What's next?

**Speaker A:** Actually, that is a very interesting question that you're asking. Very typically Western. Another way of thinking about it, going back to the story of the ox, Once we learn how to ride the— to get on and start riding the ox, then we're going to develop the skill of ox riding. All right, that's what you need to develop right now, is the development of being able to get yourself into a good state and then maintaining that.

**Speaker G:** Yes. So how do you go about that?

**Speaker A:** By— okay, There is a sutta that talks about the skill of the first jhana. Now, the surprise is, is that this is one sutta that specifically talks about the first jhana, but there are no other suttas that address any of the other jhanas other than this way. So we have to begin to think of the distinction between the first jhana and the other jhanas. Because in the West, normally we think of just jhana, and the more numbers you have, the better. But jhana is just jhana. Okay. And there's a better way of looking at it. And in fact, that was the way that it was done in the time of the Buddha, that one jhana is good, two jhanas better, three jhanas are great, four jhanas are marvelous. And then off we go into more and more and more, just like money. $1 is great, $5 is great, better, $50 is great, but not compared to $500. But once you got $500, you want $5,000. If you got $5,000, you want $500,000. If you got $500,000, you want $50 million. That's just the way the mind goes. We've been trained that way. And in fact, that was what happened with the Buddha. It was a masterstroke. When he realized that, no, it's the first jhana that is the path to enlightenment. The first jhana is the enlightenment. Why? Because the first jhana is when we develop Sukkha, which means we get into the state of being in a state of pleasure. Now, back to this one sutta that we were talking about. In this sutta, it says that there are three skills for First Jhana. The first skill is the skill of getting into it. That's the part of let's make friends with the inner self. Let's get together. Let's come out of our critical thinking into nurturing thinking. Gladden the mind. And with the gladdening of the mind and telling ourselves that we're safe, we're secure, that we're comfortable, that we're confident, that we're safe. These are the elements that bring about the first Jhana. So we have to practice getting into the first Jhana, which means to practice getting into a good state. But then the quality of the first Jhana also has to be not about just applying the mind to the wholesome, but also sustaining it. And this is the part where most Westerners don't understand that second skill is to be comfortable and then be comfortable again and then be comfortable again and then be comfortable again, rather than being comfortable for a little while and then off we go off into something else. No, we want to learn to maintain that being comfortable, to just sit there. And whenever these, these mind objects about, oh, you got to go fix the refrigerator. Or you got to go check to see if the door is not open, or you got to go check that server to make sure that it's still up, or you got to go make sure that, you know, that this is that or the other thing is done. This— and this mentality in fact has a name for it. We call it refrigerator door. It can happen even in sex. They're going after it in one of the— wait a minute, did I leave the refrigerator door open? And then And so when we have thoughts through the refrigerator door, the answer to that is, never mind, I'm going to relax right now. And we keep coming back to it over and over and over and over again. This is the quality of repetition so that we can get the mind into the state of being able to maintain and sustain wholesome thoughts. Okay, that one shot of joy is not enough. We have to keep juicing this dude. Yes, Kishan,

**Speaker H:** I think you knocked your mic.

**Speaker A:** I'm juicing the dude near your hand. Comes up. I'm listening, go ahead.

**Speaker H:** You knock your mic up a little bit and your sound went down, I think.

**Speaker A:** Say again? Speak up.

**Speaker H:** I think the sound got quieter when your mic might have moved up. I'm not sure if that was the cause, but

**Speaker A:** okay. No, I'm— can you— can all hear me now? Is everything okay?

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right,

**Speaker G:** so, okay, so we're practicing getting ourselves into these good states, right, during these sits that we're having throughout the day, right? The 4 to 6 sits. And then And then the idea is after we're in that good state— or

**Speaker A:** by the way to sit, or the walk, or the lying down. Right, right, right.

**Speaker G:** The moments of seclusion. The moments of seclusion. So after those, right, when we get up, the goal, I guess you could say, is to— you know, not goal, right? I don't want to use Western language. But language is all we have, so I'm trying my best here.

**Speaker A:** But there's a difference between an immediate goal and long-term goal. Okay, looking for immediate goals. Yes. So here's the example would be is to get yourself into a really, really good state while you're sitting in the meditation hall. Can you get up and walk outside feeling that same way?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Begin to do a walking meditation without even interrupting that state of mind, that state of flow. Okay. Yes, you can do that in first jhana, but you can't in second. And there are several reasons why, and that is because we do need that thinking mind. We do need that guidance. And if we get the mind to the point that all we can experience is our feeling, that needs to be deeply in seclusion because that's really dangerous. You don't want to be doing second jhana while you're sitting in the lion's den. Yeah, right, right.

**Speaker G:** Okay, so if I was to approach this practice, right, of sustaining this good state, I guess what I'm thinking is how that would start to show up is, you know, bringing this everywhere.

**Speaker A:** You're just happy and friendly, and I mean everybody, every part and every frown is a joke to you. Everything is humorous, everything is funny. Okay, okay, cool.

**Speaker G:** So when I got up to get in my seat, so like this is my office, right? And I work throughout the day. So after my sit, I'll sit in my chair and then I'll notice like, oh wow, I'm relaxed. Like there's still that good state. I'm looking at my computer screen like, wow, it's still pretty much similar. But what I think I'm going to—

**Speaker A:** That first word is the one that we're looking for. It's the wow. We don't even have to say anything anymore. Wow.

**Speaker C:** Oh, wow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** So I guess, Dhammarato, how to start to attune to whether or not I'm sustaining it is start to just notice whenever there's a decline in that state. And then notice, I'm guessing what you're saying is accompanied with that will be some thought of like, oh, I feel like I'm not going to be able to do this for the whole day, or, oh, some kind of worry, some kind of doubt. And then it's like, oh, nope. I don't need to worry about that.

**Speaker D:** I'm gonna.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to worry about that. Right? Yeah. Let me come back and enjoy myself for the next breath or two, at least.

**Speaker E:** Yes. Okay. Okay.

**Speaker G:** All right.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker G:** So that's it? There's nothing else? Yeah, nothing else.

**Speaker A:** You don't need it. If you can get that going. What else do you want?

**Speaker G:** No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I. I mean, is there anything else to do to sustain that other than

**Speaker A:** coming out of doing. Okay, I, I know, but every time the doing starts up, you stop it again and come back. I've already finished all my work, there's nothing to do right now. Okay, okay, that, that's it. To think of it in the fact that all the work that needed to be done has been done, and it's been done completely successfully and doesn't need any do-overs. Okay, the last moment that you just lived was okay as it was. Let it die. So is also happily in this present moment.

**Speaker G:** Is also the other immediate goal to focus on the breath while I'm like here right now with you guys, or when I'm with my girlfriend, or when I'm cooking? Like, is it to focus on the breath then too?

**Speaker A:** Well, That's another thing that a lot of people understand. In fact, a lot of meditation techniques have to do with what is your object of meditation? What are you going to focus on? And a lot of different meditation— I mean, you can see how that happened with Kasina meditation. So some dudes are going to be only focused on the mud pie. Others are only going to be focused on the fire. Others are only going to be focused on a mountaintop. Others are only going to be focused on the sky at night. So there's a lot of different old techniques that we use about this. In fact, the kid has to focus in order to learn his ABCs, write them down, put them over and over. Do any of you guys remember how hard it was to learn to read? Do you remember your ABCs? How long did it take you to learn the entire alphabet in order I mean, I struggled with that when I was still in high school. Okay, so that means it has to be repeated over and over and over and over. The Thai people even have it worse. They don't have just 26 letters in there. I would bet they've got like, um, 40 consonants, 45 consonants, and another 15 vowels or something like that. And, and so they've got a lot of stuff to memorize. But the point that I'm making here is that we have to focus with Anapanasati. The focus, the actual item that you focus on changes as your skill level changes. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. And so the beginning is, is that we use the breath as an anchor to focus on the breathing. Actually, then the next step is we begin to focus on the hearing now that we're actually in the present moment because we're watching the breath. Okay. Also, to be able to control the breath, we have to control the mind. And so we begin to pay attention to, am I paying attention to watching the breath? And by doing so and controlling it over and over and over again, we begin to develop Sati. Okay. Once we get that Sati going for that breathing, Now we begin to have other mind moments during that breath that we can pay attention to other things. This is when we begin also to gladden the mind as well as having it on the breath. And the gladdening of the mind means that now we're going to only allow wholesome thoughts in. As we do that, we begin also to monitor and experience how we feel. We do that with the body because the adrenaline that's in the blood that is forced pushed out by the mind is actually a sensation in the body. That fear is a physical sensation. Yeah, that we don't like. Okay. And so we begin to see then the emotions that are associated with the body. We can see that the body conditions the feelings, the feelings condition the mind. And now we're talking about yet another step of Anapanasati. So there winds up being 16 stages of Anapanasati. One is the breathing of the in and the out breath. Another one is experiencing the whole body, and another one is relaxing the body. So these are going to be things that you do in order. First, you watch the breathing, then you watch the body itself, and then you watch the body as it relaxes. The same thing is true about the feelings. First, we begin to recognize what feelings are there. Then we begin to recognize these feelings as Sukkha. And then we recognize these feelings as, wow, this is life itself. This is the Piti that arises, the real joy that comes. Okay. And so also, as we recognize this and start to pay attention to what's happening with the mind, we begin to see that the mind is bound up in certain ways of looking. And so we begin to liberate the mind from, for instance, all of the old rules, all the old ways of doing things. We begin to watch the thing that way. And so that we're liberating the mind by not continuing to drag it down. And then at another level, we begin to watch how the mind is now becoming integrated or unified. We can actually now watch the mind ride the bull. We can see the adult taking care of the child. We can see this integration within. Okay, so this is all done within the first Jhana. Now, when we got— after we've gotten into the first Jhana and gotten it, let us say, sufficiently practiced so that it becomes a skill, And the skill, by the way, has 5 components. And in fact, the word Samatha means to gather these components together. The first one and most important one is to be free from the hindrances or free from unwholesome thoughts so that we have only wholesome thoughts. That's a prerequisite. But also the wholesome thoughts have to guide the mind into the state of Sukkha. Once the mind is in the state of Sukkha, then we continue with the enthusiasm and the joy that we're building up. We begin to get a lot of success so that we know that we can do this. All right. So what this means now is that within the concept of the Mahasi Method, we're not just going to be noting what's there. We're going to be noticing what's there that we have actually been practicing and working on. So that means, am I actually applying the mind to the wholesome? Can I actually sustain the mind on the wholesome? Another one would be, how's my Piti? How good can I feel? How's my Sukkha? Can I feel completely relaxed? Can I actually just let the body relax? Can I actually breathe in a way that even helps the body to relax? Okay, so look at all the various objects of meditation that we have taken already. And we're just now getting started with the first Jhana because there's more to be investigated. And that is the Eightfold Noble Path. How is my Sati? Then in fact, we know that Sati is a big deal here. We have the Satipatthana, we have Anapanasati, we have Right Noble Sati as part of the Eightfold Noble Path. And we also have it as one of the enlightenment factors. Sati, Sati, Sati, Sati. So while we are practicing correctly, one of the things that we're going to keep mentioning to ourselves is, how's the Sati? Am I waking up? Am I waking up? Am I waking up? Am I waking up? You know, just over and over and over and over and over again. So this is the way that we get those new habits built in. That I remember when playing the piano, that you'd take one or two measures, you just play that one or two measures over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. That's the way that we're going to practice this, is over and over and over again. Rather than getting something as an Anagami, an experience, and then jumping to the next experience, and then jumping to the next experience— because that's the Western mindset, is to go jump from one experience to another to another— and here what we're doing is we're instead developing skills that have to be done over and over and over again. One of the examples that we can use is like polishing an old, old table that we found in the attic or something like that. And that if we take the polish, just buying the can of polish and setting that can of polish on that table is not going to polish that table. No, what polishes the table is rubbing. You have to take that polish out, but you can't just rub and rub and rub. Most people are just rubbing. That would be like the critical mind. Oh, I hate that table, I want to fix it. But no, we need to know is we need to nourish that table, and we take the oil or the grease or whatever and rub it in and rub it and rub it and rub it and rub it over in that corner over there and then rub over on this corner over here and we rub it down there, then we start rubbing the legs. Oh, it's fun to rub the legs. Yes, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Sure. So also just a little thing to add. So the thing that's great about nurturing yourself as well is that you start to nurture other people or animals in my case, because we have two dogs here. And then they start to nurture, they become more nurturing as well, you know, and so it becomes this virtuous cycle.

**Speaker A:** So it is, it very is much a virtuous cycle or a positive feedback loop is another way of saying it. Yes, that nurturing builds nurturing and criticism builds criticism. It just works that way.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yes. And I saw that poem Anagami that I wrote about.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I did.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And what's been so interesting is we have a dog here who can be quite rambunctious sometimes. And we've taken a very nurturing— How about excited?

**Speaker A:** Because excited sounds nurturing and rambunctious sounds critical.

**Speaker D:** You're right. Excited dog. Very excited dog. So we've taken this very nurturing approach with him, and he's gotten a lot calmer and, you know, just more content and less excited all the time, you know. And it's been really fun to watch this with our dog. So he's right over here, he's being very calm.

**Speaker A:** Well, he's pretty inspired about that. Yes, I know that well, that in fact the dogs here get excited when someone comes home. And if on those rare occasions, these dogs are just, you know, how to say it, they are never away from me longer than an hour or two, except once a year when visa time.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, our dogs are never away from us either.

**Speaker A:** And so when I come back home, they go nuts. Then in fact, as the truck comes into the driveway, the dogs are out already in the yard. They're sitting there waiting, and when the truck comes in, they're out in the yard and they start barking and jumping and all kinds of things like that. And the first thing that I do with the dogs in that occasion is to to sit down with them either in the bedroom or here and just nurture them, that that's what they're wanting. And after a few moments of nurturing them— well, actually, Poon Pui is kind of crazy for the scratches. She just will not get enough scratches, but she just sits there and licks her nose and goes into bliss while I'm giving her a back scratch. But this is something that I do on a regular basis for them. Because I know that that excitement is there. You can see them also get excited when it's time for food. So yeah, dogs get excited and it's lovely to see that they care enough about you so much that they just can't stand the fact that they're not with you. So that's really nurturing to pay them that attention back. And yet most people, when that happens with the dog, they've got their arms full of groceries or whatever and they're intent on taking the groceries to the kitchen. And every time they come home, the dog is excited. And every time they come home, they pay no attention to the dog at all. Rather than, no, the dog is there to reestablish that friendship. Let's go ahead and stop what we're doing and sit down and scratch the dog and tell them how much we love them and rub their head and all of that kind of stuff. And by the way, I've got one of them right under the chair here. When I'm talking about it because she's moving around and whatnot because she knows we're talking about her. You can almost hear her wag her tail, hits it on the floor. Yes, Alex, go ahead. By the way, Brandon, good to see you on camera.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, hey, good to see you, Brandon.

**Speaker D:** Good to see you, Brandon.

**Speaker C:** Nice to see you guys too.

**Speaker G:** Um, Dhammarato, so So how do we know when is the appropriate time to do the— or not do, but to follow or go into these subsequent habits of entering the first Jhana that you're talking about?

**Speaker A:** When you remember that Sati for you, you do it whenever you remember. So we're going to practice 5, 6, 7 times a day to get ourselves into the habit of starting remembering, because you in fact Anicca, you can feel good anytime you remember to feel good. The question is, can you remember to feel good?

**Speaker G:** But I was talking about the specific aspects of getting to the first Jhana that you were talking about. So first there's gladdening the mind, then there's there's gliding the mind first, then there's, you know, the feelings, then the experience, then the feelings. And then I can't remember whatever, what else you said. But you said like looking at the mind, you know, like unifying the mind. How do I know which? Because you said you got to practice one first. Right? Like you're practicing the piano. So how will I know when I'm ready to move on to the next practice?

**Speaker A:** You do all of the stuff that I've been talking about. As you gain, let us say, skill, all of that happens within 10 seconds. Okay, it's just a sequence. I mean, one thought after another. The first thought is I remember the breath. The second one is I take a breath. The third one is that I'm really interested in how good I feel about the breath. Is look how far I've gone already, and I'm just taking that first breath. I'm still on that in-breath, and already I've gotten the mind attuned to the breathing. Okay, but that's a skill that needs to be developed. So you're asking a question about how long does it take when you have no skills versus how long does it take when you do have skills. Well, you can apply that to anything. I mean, you can apply that to laying bricks. A skilled bricklayer can lay bricks fast and beautifully. A brand new guy just learning how to do bricks, he's slow and the outcome of his wall is not strong and ugly. Never mind, go build another wall and you'll learn how to do it.

**Speaker G:** I'm not brand new to it though. I've been doing— I'm not brand new to it though. I'm What I'm new to is doing the 5 or 7 times a day, but I'm not new to enjoying the breath and doing the Samatha. I'm not new to that. So that's why I was asking, like,

**Speaker A:** just— Okay, well then that's the sequence is to remember to investigate, to throw out the unwholesome thoughts, to remember to investigate the breath as well. Or the body so that you take a deep breath and then we work on the feelings. So it would be the mind, body, mind, body, mind, body, then the feelings. And then you would have mind, body, feelings, mind, body, feelings until you all the way into the first Jhana. And then what we do is we do mind, body, feelings, mind, body, feelings for a while until we get really, really good at it. And then we can begin to watch all Mind arising and passing away, body arising and passing away, all feelings arising and passing away. And so we begin to watch the arising and the passing away of this. And so that's when the mind is sharp. You see, in the beginning, we only see things as they arise. But as we gain skill, we can see both the arising of this, but also as this is arising, that is passing away. And as the new third thing arises, you can see the second thing passing away. Once you can come to the point of gaining this first Jhana, like I said, the things that we're going to use as objects of meditation are the factors of the first Jhana itself. That's our factors. In other words, how is my Sati? How is my investigation? How is my effort? How is my attitude? How is my right to— how is my ability to apply the mind to the wholesome? How can I sustain it? How is my Sukkha? How is my Piti? Okay, so now we're talking about these are the things worth the investigation, and all of those things are wholesome. Okay. In the old days, when you were just investigating whatever was there, you've got a bunch of crap to investigate. Now that we've gotten the crap out of the mind, what we're going to do is investigate negate the skills that we're developing. Yes, Brandon.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I had a question. So I know you talk a lot in this about like using the breath as a concentration object or something to focus on. What are your thoughts on things like visual sensations? Like, I have this kind of weird habit I've developed at work where when it's slow and nothing's going on, I'll just— we're kind of forced to stand at the computers sometimes, and I'll just stand and act like I'm looking and doing something, and I'll just stare at the X in the top right-hand corner of the browser, and I'll stare at the center of it and can like focus on basically like this tiny circle where the four parts of the X meet. And I'm like using that as an object in it. It's like, I don't know, what are your thoughts on like that versus like the breath, which is more of like a traditional common object?

**Speaker A:** Because I know actually, I've been actually fixating the eyes, fixating the eyes on an object is even an older practice.

**Speaker E:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yes. This goes way back into history. Fire meditation.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Stargazing is also very, very old practice. People have been laying around at night with nothing to do but to look up at the stars and do stargazing. They've been doing that for tens of thousands of years. The problem is when they stop gazing at the sky and start making up stories about it, and then you've got a religion or two on your hands. Yeah, about sky daddies. There's people in the sky, there's, there's Leos and Scorpions and and all of that kind of stuff, rather than getting the mind into a state of gazing. And I'm using the word gazing intentionally because gazing is the exact opposite of staring. Yeah, or focusing on an object. In other words, don't focus when you're— stay in your eye door, but don't focus on anything. That in fact, if you can get a distant object, is better than a close object. In other words, gazing within a room doesn't help, but gazing out into the forest, gazing into the trees without finding a particular leaf to gaze at, you're just looking, or let us say, stare at. So one object is something that we stare at, and we've been doing that our whole lives. We have been staring at things. Stare at A's, we stare at B's, we stare at C's, we stare at 1's, we stare at 2's, stare at paper, we stare at the screen. We've been just in the system of staring. And so when it's time to meditate or do this practice, we need to refocus the focusing into non-focusing. Well, that's back into gazing.

**Speaker C:** Happens when I do it is is you either are forced to blink the eyes like normal or just leave them open and everything will go in a sense out of focus. And it's just like your whole visual field's just like glazed over and you're just like allowing it. It's a weird place to like— Yes,

**Speaker A:** just to allow whatever's coming in. And right, you're not focusing on anything, so everything is out of focus. But here's a point about that. And that is, is that when we're staring at this, we're going to miss what's happening over here. But if we're just not looking at anything and just kind of gazing, then things that are happening over here, we can see it out of the corner of our eye. So actually practicing what is your full field of view— in other words, can— what can I do now? I can see the hand, I can see the thumb over there even though I'm looking over here. So this is like at least 90 degrees out of my field of focus. Then in fact, our whole field of view is about almost 180 degrees, about 175, something like that. So the question is, can you actually increase your peripheral vision? Can you stop looking at what you're looking at and start looking at whatever the eye can gather?

**Speaker C:** I've noticed that ability. Yeah, I've noticed that ability grow for a bit in maybe the past like month or two, like the— as I've been practicing, like the periphery of vision comes like it's like more cohesively tied in with, with how I'm looking at things just day to day.

**Speaker A:** Um, okay, we can talk about it like this, that basically The whole practice is to get out of our minds and get out of the sensory input from the mind and start using the other senses so that we actively use the mind, use the eyes as the gazing of not looking at anything. But that becomes, let us call it, the object of meditation. Or we're just listening without hearing anything in particular. But you begin to hear the sounds of silence because things are not silent. You can even hear the wind blow. All right. The other thing is sitting in the chair. Can you feel your butt? Can you feel your knee? Can you feel your toes? Can you feel the rest of your body? In other words, we're going to wake up the body by being in the senses. We're going to wake up the eyes. We're going to wake up the olfactory. When you're breathing in, what do you smell? Can you actually pay attention to what the air smells like as you're breathing. So sensory input is the way that we're talking about, and that we start out by being always using the primary number one input device is the mind. But that primary input device of the mind, the only things that the mind can contact or become conscious of is stuff out of the past. It's our stored junk. But if we are in our senses, that means that we're in the here-now. We're in the inner reality that what the eyes see is what the light is coming into the eyes right now. What the mind sees was what the eye saw when we were a child or 10 years ago or whatever like that. And so while we're actually in visual acuity, we're not in the mind. So the more we practice being in the senses, the better. And so we can actually practice by being in a wholesome state of just watching or just noticing the body as it's moving while we're walking. Or just basically in walking meditation, the idea is to keep the eyes focused on the surrounding ground around you without paying any particular— just to make sure that you're seeing where you're going, that you know where every step is going to be taken, that we— if we are— if we're doing walking meditation, let us say going to town, then every store on the forefront will become an object to distract us. So it's better just to be aware of where we're going. The example is 2 bow lengths, or let us say about maybe 10 to 12 feet in front, that the monks are actually trained that way to go on bendabout, is that we keep the eyes down and focused on the path because we're out there barefooted, you better watch where you're going. And so that's the whole point of it, is the walking meditation is best done while you're barefoot. Why? Because then you're almost required to watch every step. Don't step on that. Don't step on this. Well, if we get into the habit of watching where we're going in walking meditation by using the eye door, we can begin to do that with our mind when we're walking through our own mental jungle. Oh, don't step on that. Don't put the mind on that. Anicca, you keep— you stay on the path, stay on the safe road. So this is a way of practicing with the eye door. We want to practice with the eye door, but not in the sense of focusing in on something and ignoring all the rest. But rather, this is an opening meditation, not a concentration meditation.

**Speaker D:** OK.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Jack.

**Speaker B:** As part of brightening the mind, I've taken on the practice of imagining, sometimes imagining wholesome situations, wholesome environments, like going to the park, imagining walking along the path and the birds singing and so on. Is that acceptable or is that considered outside the realm of reality?

**Speaker A:** No, that's— you're— What do you think, guys? Is birds singing in his ears? Is that real or what?

**Speaker C:** Totally fake.

**Speaker A:** Totally. Oh, it's not a real bird. Okay. Okay. So that's the answer, is what? Right. Right now it's just a memory. But when the bird is actually singing, then in fact, I mentioned that from time to time. I don't hear any birds right now, but we often have birds off in the distance here. That are singing. And it's good to notice that. One of the games, by the way, that I play with the dogs is who knows first. What I mean by who knows first, like the dogs are always interested when someone comes into the yard or even into the neighbor's yard because we're in a kind of a compound here. On almost like a cul-de-sac. And any automobile that comes onto the cul-de-sac, these dogs will bark at it because they think that they're on the cul-de-sac. My job or my toy to play with is that I know somebody's on the cul-de-sac before the dogs do.

**Speaker B:** What I'm saying, Dhammarato, I'm talking about is imagining this like I'm sitting in my chair and I'm imagining I'm going walk in the park. I'm imagining all the wonderful things that I'm seeing and hearing.

**Speaker A:** Oh, well, just recognize that that's an imagination. That is not real.

**Speaker B:** But it's still wholesome, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, you have a choice over it. That's the whole point about this. You have a choice over whether you're going to be in sensory awareness or in the mental or the mind sensory awareness, or your others like the eyes, ears, nose, touch, taste. That is one kind of sense. And the other kind of sense is based upon the past. Now, if you're going to have those kind of thoughts, make sure that those kind of thoughts are wholesome. If you're in sensory awareness, make sure that the sensory information that's coming in is just simply real. It's real, okay? What's really there that we're interested in coming into the reality of the senses rather than the criticism of the mind. And so if you can have wholesome thoughts about, wow, this is really great— in fact, when we begin to have wholesome thoughts, generally the wholesome thoughts are about the way things are right now. Unwholesome thoughts are generally about how the things ought to be right now, or how they should be over there, or how we can fix what happened in the past into the future. So generally our wholesome thoughts have to do with the here now anyway. Wow, this is nice. Wow, happy birthday, I'm born again.

**Speaker B:** And the wholesome imagining then brings on the wholesome thought of, wow, what a great thing, what a wonderful thing to have this imagination that can bring up this sense of wholesomeness.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so long as what we're imagining is wholesome, because you're also capable of imagining quite a disaster for yourself by thinking about your mother-in-law's coming. Yes, Robert. I think Christopher has something first. Chris, do you have something?

**Speaker E:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** um, try again, you're breaking up. Yes, so you, you brought up 1 John a bunch of times, and, uh, I brought this up last night when we went and Dan had his Sangha,

**Speaker F:** but,

**Speaker A:** um, you mentioned that when you talk to people, sometimes they go in and out of, uh, things that I've read on. You can't listen. What do you What's your thoughts on that? Can somebody help me? He was breaking up for me.

**Speaker G:** Or did you break it up for me, Christopher? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** All right, Chris, can you just try audio only maybe and turn the video off?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Great.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I'm gonna go ahead

**Speaker F:** and Now it seems like you're muted.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now your microphone is muted, but your video is still on. The idea was to turn off the video and to turn your microphone on. I've done that before. Okay. All right, Robert, what did you have?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so a couple of things. So one is, one way that I see the breath as a great meditation object is that when you're taking deep breaths, you're relaxing the physiological system immediately, right? And I imagine that's why the breath is chosen rather than a kasina or the stars or something like that, or a cloud. Et cetera, is you have that immediate physiological relaxing of the body. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, the breath is in fact that tied to the body that even when you're doing nothing else, Generally, you're still breathing. We've always got that with us. We've always got the breath here to work with, as opposed to a meditation object like Anapanasati on a cell phone or a casino or something like that. We don't always have that, but the breath, we always have it. But you're right, that actual physiological thing is that deep Taking deep breaths is relaxing for the body. Now, some people work too hard at taking deep breaths and then they get tired. But this is one of the reasons why I would recommend students don't practice for 2 hours, because you don't have the capability of doing that. That is better just to practice the breathing for just a few minutes, get the mind in a really, really good state. That's the way to operate. And then as we progress, we want to be able to maintain that state beyond our practice time. So can you get up off the floor maintaining that good state? Can you walk across the room maintaining that good state? Can you walk out of the house maintaining that good state by continuing to think about the wholesome? That's the reason that we want to get into seclusion, so we can get away from all of that agitating noise that these senses bring in that get the mind started up. And so the way then is to intentionally pay attention to the senses without getting the mind agitated about things other than talking to ourselves about what the body is actually doing, what the sensations. Oh, what was that? I saw it and I can read

**Speaker G:** it to you, Dhammarato. Okay, Christopher says, I was going to ask about first Jhana again. I asked on Wednesday during Dan's Sangha, but I'd like to hear Dhammarato's opinion. Dhammarato mentions that people come in and out of first Jhana even during the conversations he has with them. But I've read in a few places that first Jhana is very intense, like Kundalini. I just wanted to see what Dhammarato had to say about that.

**Speaker A:** It can be intense when people don't know what they're doing, and it can be intense because people are looking for intensity rather than First Jhana. That's me. I've had that. Okay, but in fact, in the suttas, there are a number of different suttas that mention five factors, and intense is not one of them. So let's go over.

**Speaker G:** Christopher says, how would you define first jhana and how can we recognize when we are in it?

**Speaker A:** I'm about to do that.

**Speaker G:** All right, let's go.

**Speaker A:** All right, there are 5 factors to the first jhana and they are listed as 5 factors in almost all of the suttas, but there is an occasional sutta that does not have these 5 factors. It has 6. And the 6th factor that is occasionally added is the body is relaxed. So we can go ahead and take care of that one to say that that would be a kind of a natural outcome, but that the skill factors that are gathered together will bring about that 6th factor of the relaxation of the body. So the number one factor of the Jhana, that nothing can be done so long as there are hindrances or unwholesome thoughts in the mind. That's the number one item. And so if people are practicing a meditation form that has not gotten rid of the hindrances, this is referred to as dry insight meditation. Yeah, it very, very much is like driving your car without being able to use the accelerator. Somebody's got an echo on. I don't hear it now. Hear a lot of— I think you just put your headphones on, Robert, and now I'm hearing a lot of noise. So anyway, I'm repeating myself right now. Back to the first Jhana. The first item on the list is that the mind has to be free from the hindrances. That means that the mind has to be free from unwholesome thoughts. That's the number one item. And yet many people are practicing without the knowledge of that, and so they wind up practicing in a way that doesn't give them good results, because they don't even have the number one item on the Jhana list, which is wholesome thinking. So the number one item is to have the mind free from unwholesome thoughts, which means now the mind has wholesome thoughts. Or we can use the expression, because two of the factors also besides the removal of the hindrances of Applied and sustained thought. The apply means to apply it to the wholesome, and sustaining it means that we're sustaining wholesome thoughts. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought.

**Speaker G:** That's number 2, Dhammarato?

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm not putting it in numbers and ones and twos. I'm trying to describe all the factors that have to come together. Oh, okay, okay. Let us say that you're going to be cooking a cake, and you have to get the ingredients for the cake. There's many ingredients. One of the ingredients you need is the pot to put the ingredients in. Another ingredient is you need the stove or the oven to bake the cake. Another ingredient is going to be the sugar, and another one is the flour and the eggs. So let us say that you've got all the ingredients for the cake except for one thing, the sugar. You don't have any sugar. If you don't have any sugar, you got all the other ingredients and you're going to work those together. When you finish that product and it comes out of the oven, is that a cake? No, no, no. It may not be delicious at all. Okay, so here's the point about it, is, is that, okay, so which is in order then for that, for the cake? Because you ask which order, number 1 and number 2. Is the eggs number 1 and the milk number

**Speaker D:** 2?

**Speaker A:** And the sugar number 3 and the flour number 4? Is that the order that you're trying to put it in? Because this didn't matter. You have to have all the ingredients, and when you have all the ingredients together, then you've got the first Jhana. And it doesn't matter which order those ingredients came, but they can be seen as having a kind of an order, because you can't do this skill or bring that factor in without already having the first factor. So the first factor that has to come in and the way that we bring that in is with applied and sustained thought by applying the mind to the wholesome and sustaining it on the wholesome that helps us rid of the hindrances. Once we have the hindrances removed with these wholesome thoughts, we're also using those wholesome thoughts to literally talk ourselves into feeling good. That's the Sukkha. The Sukkha then is, I feel good, I feel relaxed, or we're gladdening the mind, brightening the mind. And by brightening the mind, those feelings come along with it. And so the kind of thoughts that we want to have are designed then to bring about that particular aspect of the feeling of Sukkha. So one of the things we want to say is there's nothing dangerous here. Here. There's no gorillas. Make a joke out of it. There's no— there's no, um, godmothers. There are no angry gods. There are no mother-in-laws. There are no cops. There's no gorillas. There's no bears. There's nothing here to be dangerous. So we talk ourselves into feeling safe and secure. We talk ourselves into feeling comfortable. And that's one of the problems with people sitting in meditation too long is because the body gets uncomfortable naturally. But the practice of First Jhana has to have that quality of comfort to it. If it doesn't have comfort, then this— then the Sukkha is not Sukkha at all. It's Dukkha because we're uncomfortable. I mean, how clear can we be? And so we bring about the sense of safety and comfort by talking ourselves into it. If we feel anxiety, we can nurture that anxiety by saying, oh well, there's nothing to be anxious about right now. Let me continue to take a few deep breaths and see if I can play with that anxiety so that I can move it around. Can I bring it up? Can I put it down? Can I make it circle around? Can I bring— can I go up when I breathe in and down when I breathe out? Can I move it down to the belly? Can I move it down to the toe? Can I move it up to the nose? What can I do with anxiety to take control of it in a playful way? And as we play, play with the anxiety, it melts away back into comfort and satisfaction. So comfort and satisfaction and applied and sustained thought and being free from the hindrances now sets the stage for the success. And that is when the student gets the idea, I can do this, I can keep coming back to the state of relaxation, I can keep coming back to the state of security and comfort. And that's when the wow factor occurs. Wow, I can do this! Wow, if I keep doing this, I won't have any more problems for the rest of my life. All I have to do is set down the burden, and it's heavy anymore. That 10-pound or 20-pound or 150-pound barbell is not heavy when I'm not holding it. All I have to do is set down those hindrances and I can come back into a state of Sukkha, a state of relaxation. So those are the 5 factors of the first Jhana. Everybody passes in and out of the first Jhana on a natural basis, especially children. We're almost, let us say, have the Jhana factors of childhood beaten out of us, with a pencil. What is that pencil used for? 1-2-3-ABC, that's what it's used for, and there's no joy. Samadhi in doing that for the child. All children struggle with their education. And so as we're adults now, they begin to struggle with their education in meditation, that we fight with ourselves on the inside trying to straighten things out in there. And that's the way that we got it in a mess in the first place, was by fighting with ourselves. And so that first Jhana is actually part of the integration process. That in fact the first Jhana does get the mind into an organized state. The first Jhana is enough for enlightenment, and the Buddha says that. And in fact, it's in Sutta number 36. Why, he says, was I so afraid of the pleasures of first Jhana when there are not sensual pleasures their pleasures are coming out of the mind. And then he got the idea that that's it. This is, by the way, the story of the rose apple tree. Have you ever heard of the story of the rose apple tree? In Thai language, the rose apple is chumpoo. So the— Gotama the Sakyan, as a child, was sitting under the rose apple tree while his father was doing a ceremony, a plowing ceremony. And that's when he is obviously clear that he had good teachers. Then, in fact, we even know who the name of the teacher was. His name was Konda. And so Konda was teaching him about this Jhana stuff. And so the Buddha was actually able to do it. And when he was a child, But he didn't know what he eventually figured out that no one knew. And that is, is that that first Jhana that we can get ourselves into naturally from time to time is the state of mind that we could be in all the time if we would practice it. Every one of you has been in a really, really joyful, happy, uplifting state of mind in your lives. If you didn't, you'd already be dead now. The question is, can we cultivate those uplifting feelings of being on top of the world, feeling like I've got this wired? Generally, we go around doing things in society to get trophies and prizes in order to feel that success. But really, we can create that feeling of success on the inside. So we're creating the feeling of success, we're creating the feeling of satisfaction. And when we get into the state of feeling satisfied and relaxed, that's first Jhana. And the mind is applied and sustained on wholesome thinking. And by doing the applied and sustained wholesome thinking, we now can develop that first Jhana as a skill. That normally we pass right out of it because we're not intentionally keeping the mind wholesome. And so the two skills then is one is to start working so that we can intentionally bring on this state of being in a state of good cheer. And then the next skill is the skill of being able to sustain that. To guard the mind, to make sure that we're looking now at every mind moment, or if not every second mind moment, or if not every 1 second, or if not every 10 seconds. But whatever our rate, we keep remembering to take the mind out of the unwholesome ordinary thinking, back into the thoughts that are associated with the first Jhana, that things feel good, things feel nice. This breath is wonderful. Oh, it feels really good to breathe. These are the kind of thoughts that have to do with the here-now. And you can have that kind of— you've had those experiences before, those experiences that are often accompanied by the thought of, wow, isn't this really nice? Wow, isn't this really great? That's the first Jhana. So cultivate that. Cultivate getting into that state where you do not have any trouble, that you are on top of the world right now. That's what the supramundane means, is to be above it all. Wow, I'm floating off into the air. I feel so good. That's first Jhana. Yes, Alex.

**Speaker G:** Yeah. And so then there— I'm guessing there's probably a point at which you don't need the first jhana anymore, right?

**Speaker A:** You just— no, you just maintain the first jhana. When you say you don't need it, you don't need to do anything to get it. It's part of your nature now. It's become the new habit. And then the new habit of being joyful.

**Speaker G:** And then from that habit is where everything else that is being investigated gets thoroughly investigated, right? And let go of, or seen through, or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, in the following way. If it is unwholesome, it's immediately thrown out. If it is Dukkha, we immediately throw it out. If it is a cow pie, the farmer does not step in it.

**Speaker G:** And you could say that when you say throw it out, that could be synonymous with let go. Let go.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's right. But letting go is passive. Okay, throwing it out has got more to do with the Atamayata. In fact, I have a friend, his name is David. He was a monk for many years, and he had the idea— this is really great— he says, have you ever taken your finger and dug into your nose and come up with a great big booger? And out it comes, and it's sitting on your finger, right? You can't just let it go. It's not going to. It's sticking to the finger just like it's stuck to the mind, and what we have to do is flick it off. Yeah, so also mentions it in the sense of the cowherd who has to whack the cow, to whack those thoughts. Aha, I see you, Mara. So that's how we treat unwholesome thoughts, is by whacking them, or about throwing them out.

**Speaker G:** Because I know also the practice is to be gentle with ourselves too, right? To have care. So the sense of like whacking something just seems a little rigid, a little hard.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker G:** Harsh.

**Speaker A:** I understand that it sounds that way. But in fact, if the cowherd whacks the cow to keep it from eating the groceries on the food stand, then that cow will be safe. If that cowherd does not whack that cow to get it off the table, then the owner of the food stall is going to be causing all kinds of trouble with the cowherd. Okay, so that's what we mean by avoiding the Dukkha. How do we avoid the Dukkha? Is that we throw it out, right? Just like when you're in the— when you're in the kitchen and you see the garbage that needs to be carried out, you can either carry it out grumpily or you can carry it out happily. But you have to put in the effort to take it out of the kitchen and put it out on the road.

**Speaker G:** And I can see a way in which it's almost like instantaneous and like the seeing of the Dukkha is kind of the throwing it out as well.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. And you throw it out. And then with that expression, aha, I see you, Mara. Yeah. Aha, I got that. Yeah. Or another way that I use often is, is that, wow, I don't have to think about that. Now the thought, wow, I don't have to think about that, is no longer thinking about it. It's getting efficient to not think about it. I've just thrown it out. Wow, I'm so glad I don't have to think about her.

**Speaker G:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Or wow, I'm so glad I don't have to think about visas today. That's next month. You know, things like this. Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think another way to think about it is like the way we approach unwholesome thoughts versus a human being that's acting unwholesomely or an animal or something like that, right? Which is with the human being or the animal, now the instinct might be to treat that the way you would whack a cow, right? But in fact, the human being and the animal is a collection of wholesome and unwholesome. So you cultivate the wholesome in the other being by being nurturing. But the unwholesome thought is just an unwholesome thought. There isn't any other side to it. So, that's the case where you would whack. And so, it's kind of like harm reduction in a sense where you're reducing your scope for the time you do the whacking only to various things and the rest of the time you're nurturing.

**Speaker G:** [Speaker:BEN] It's interesting. I feel like this is really coming together really beautifully for me because it seems that if we are cultivating these wholesome thoughts and the wholesome and the here now and we're making that like we're making a stronger relationship to that aspect of ourselves. Right now, the stronger relationship is in unwholesome, is in doubt, is in the hindrances. So, we're reframing it, building a stronger relationship with these wholesome thoughts, the here-now, the I see yous, the I don't have to do that. Oh, wow. With all that, right? That it makes it so much easier to whack away the unwholesome because you feel safer. You feel like you are a walking bird's nest.

**Speaker A:** That's how I feel.

**Speaker H:** Like, you're safe.

**Speaker G:** It's much easier to shoo away something that can seem threatening when most of that source is already safe and at peace and satisfied.

**Speaker A:** That's why we literally have to talk ourselves into feeling safe. We really do. We have to talk ourselves into feeling safe because we have for many, many years talked ourselves into being unsafe.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** How do we do that? Is by giving ourselves jobs to do. Oh, you've got to go do this. Oh, you've got to finish your homework. What's the motivation behind that? It's not the ought to, it's the fear. Yeah, yeah. And now we're recognizing there's nothing to be afraid of. Oh, Keyshawn, yes.

**Speaker H:** I wanted to point out that all the meditation practice that we're discussing, there's a sutta that points out that that's only one of the ways to enter into the first Jhana, and that talking about the Dharma is another way to enter into the first Jhana. I think that Christopher was saying that someone else is saying that that couldn't be done. So I wonder what they would have to say about that sutta.

**Speaker A:** Well, Kishon, I'm really glad that you mentioned that. I was actually a few moments ago had that sutta in mind. And now that you're bringing it back up, in fact, it's one of those sutras that mentioned the first Jhana factor as also besides the five that are normally listed, it adds relaxation. And now the sutta is about, in fact, five ways to enter into the first Jhana. And that the normal way that Westerners think about doing the first Jhana is actually the last item on Buddha's list. Think about that. It's the last item on his list. And almost always, the way that Buddhism is given as a list of items is the first item on the list is always the most important. Important. Okay, and so the way that we do that— the last item on the list is sitting down and practicing meditation. That's the fifth item on the list. It's the hardest way to attain first Jhana. The first way is listed as a conversation between the Dhamma student and the Dhamma teacher. Because as we're talking about the Dhamma, guess what? We've already got the first item wired just by talking about Jhana. Just because we're talking about the Dharma, we're talking about wholesome things. Not once have any of you complained about Aunt Susie. Not today. We haven't broke— we haven't talked about how bad this and that and the other thing are. We're all doing holds some talk. That's the first thing, that we're already gaining one of the most important Jhana factors just by having a conversation about the Dhamma. And if the student is reflecting that well, and actually, basically, it's possible when you know what to do, you can talk someone into the first Jhana. And then sit there and watch them and then talk them back out of the first Jhana just to gain your skills and then talk them back into the first Jhana again. How do we do that is because we're using wholesome words and we invite the student to start feeling comfortable and start feeling relaxation. And because the student now is listening to the Dhamma, the wholesome, they're applying their mind to that wholesome Dharma and sustaining it. And then they'll get a big kick out of it. And that, that, that howl of laughter, that's the indication of entering into the first Jhana. But laughter itself is an indication that one is going into the first Jhana. If— but there's other reasons for laughter. But that's one of the ways of using it, is that we can see what the student is doing because of the way that the student is reacting, just by watching them. And by continuing to talk that way and by saying the same thing over and over again. In fact, you could, in some old Western language, you could call it a hypnotic induction. Because it fits the term. Okay, so what do— what is done then is that the teacher talks about it in the sense of being in the present moment. And so the student gets into the present moment, and we talk about everything is okay, everything is fine. And so the teacher starts to go through the wholesome words, the wholesome language. He has a big joy to share with the students, and the students pick up on that. So literally, the Buddha talks about the first way, the easiest way to enter first Jhana is by getting talked into it. But it also mentions that the same thing will happen to the teacher, that the teachers are just as likely or even more likely to go into Anagami, first Jhana, while they're talking about it than the students, because they're more used to doing it. Now there's another way of doing it, and that is that you can go away and reflect upon the Dharma and just keep thinking about it, or maybe even watching a video. You can fall in— not fall into, but you can work yourself into the first Jhana just because you're continuing to have wholesome thoughts, thoughts of the breath. Thoughts of everything is okay, thoughts of joy, thoughts of safety, thoughts of satisfaction. And those thoughts then is the material that we use to bring ourselves into the state of first jhana. It's not magic. It's an ordinary state of being. You guys go in and out of first jhana at least once a day. The question is, how did you get into it? Was it by accident or did you create it? And then once you've got it, do you know that you've got it so that you can sustain it? All of this has to do with Sati. Sati, to remember, to wake up, to remember, to remember. Because if you can remember Sati, Sati should actually be almost like the light switch or the push button. And all you have to do is just push that button and the lights come on and you're in first Jhana. How does that happen? That's the skill that's to be developed, that you could just go into first Jhana just by taking a relaxed breath.

**Speaker D:** A quick question. What is that? What sutta is this?

**Speaker A:** It's in the Anguttara, number 5.

**Speaker D:** Number 5. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Isn't well defined. You know, the Anguttara are numbered once. I think I don't know what number it is. It may be something like number 62 or something like that. That sutta comes to mind.

**Speaker D:** All right, Kishon, could you please link us that? I'd love to read that.

**Speaker H:** I don't have a link. I've never read it myself.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you can search on the YouTube channel for An— I don't know if

**Speaker H:** reading the suttas is one of the 5 ways to get into jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. Absolutely. Absolutely. By reading the suttas, or in the case of the monks having memorized the suttas and going over the memorization over and over again. That's been in fact one of the favorite ways of doing that is by doing one of the particular chants over and over and over and over and over again, just doing like They do it again, they do it again, then do it again, and then do it again. And it becomes quite joyful to just repeat that phrase over and over and over and over and over again. But that's not the only one. I mean, there's many different phrases that we can use.

**Speaker E:** Choose.

**Speaker A:** But so long as it's Dhamma, even reading a sutta, then in fact you probably all have that expression or that experience. So you're reading along in the sutta and all of a sudden you read something and it goes— well, that's First Jhana. It just knocks you right into the First Jhana immediately. It's like, what? And you don't even get the hell out. It's just the what that comes It strikes us. Okay, so that kind of positive insight can be done with studying the Dhamma, listening to the Dharma, teaching the Dharma. That in fact, the teaching of the Dharma is one of the best ways that the Buddha references as how to learn the Dhamma is by teaching it. One is by listening. Anagami is by discussion. Another one is by individual practice and mulling it over in our mind over and over and over again. But then it comes to the point that if you really want to learn the Dhamma, you gotta teach the Dhamma. Why is that? Because now you want to make sure that you've got it right, that you go look up the words that you're using to see do they fit to the suttas, do they fit with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, Or in the case that we have is, did I hear that from Dhammarato, or did I hear that from the Arahant? Where did you hear this stuff? So that's the way that we begin to practice the Dhamma, not while we're sitting there intentionally doing Anapanasati, but just mulling over the Dhamma, how nice it is. A path to liberation. And just thinking about that, the path the Buddha's providing us with, the Eightfold Noble Path, and the darn thing works. So just thinking about the Eightfold Noble

**Speaker H:** Path

**Speaker A:** is enough to throw you right into the first Jhana.

**Speaker E:** Uh,

**Speaker G:** Dhammarato, your laugh is insane, man. It's nuts.

**Speaker H:** I love it.

**Speaker A:** Was that also— it seems to be doing his job. Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Also a skill to be developed, the laugh.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Laughter is a skill to be developed. I mean, look how many different songs you can play with laughter. There's snickering, there's busting out laughing, There's a belly laugh. I mean, look how many different laughs that we can have, and we can practice each one individually so that we gain a skill for it.

**Speaker D:** Awesome.

**Speaker A:** So guys, this has been a really delightful conversation. I really appreciated that. Has anybody got anything to add before we leave this? Andrew, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Christopher, how about you? You got anything? Okay, how about you, Jeff? You got anything to go with?

**Speaker B:** Uh, not really. It was a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Okay guys, how about you, Robert?

**Speaker D:** Uh, thanks so much, and don't worry, be happy. Have a lovely Friday night or Saturday morning.

**Speaker A:** Don't worry, be happy. Keyshawn, how's it going?

**Speaker G:** Going great.

**Speaker A:** You've been very silent tonight. Good to see you. Okay guys, well, thank you so much. This has been a really good Sangha meeting. I really enjoyed it. I hope you guys can become friends with one another, to talk with one another, to ask questions and share. By the way, Kishon, where is Eric? Right here. Oh wow, there he is. Good to see you guys.

**Speaker D:** Wow, this is the surprise guest.

**Speaker H:** Got a real-life Dhamma dude here.

**Speaker A:** A real-life Dhamma dude on the scene. Okay, excellent, excellent, guys. Thank you so much. This has been really great. Alex, I really appreciate you joining our call too. This is your first time on, so great.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, uses the classic **Ten Ox-Herding Pictures** (a Zen parable of spiritual progress) as a framework to discuss the core attitude needed for effective meditation and the Noble Path. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Metaphor: The Ox-Herding Story**
The discussion centers on the ten pictures, reinterpreted through a psychological lens:
*   **The Ox** represents a part of our own mind. Two primary interpretations are offered:
    1.  **The Inner Child / Primitive Mind:** The instinctual, emotional, often rebellious part of us.
    2.  **The Parent Ego State:** The internalized authority figure full of rules, criticism, and "shoulds."
*   **The Journey** is about integrating these parts of the mind through friendship, not force.

### **Central Problem: Getting Stuck at Stage 4**
The critical point where most meditators fail is **Picture 4: "Catching the Ox."** Here, the practitioner tries to **forcefully control** the mind (the ox)—dragging it by the nose with criticism, strict rules, and struggle. This creates an **internal war** between the critical parent and the rebellious child, mirroring the common Western approach to meditation and life.

### **The Essential Shift: From Force to Friendship**
The path forward is found in **Pictures 5 & 6: "Herding the Ox" and "Riding the Ox Home."** The key is to **make friends with your mind.**
*   **Nurture, Don't Criticize:** Replace the inner critic with a **nurturing, comforting inner voice.** When the mind wanders or difficult emotions arise, respond with "thanks for the reminder" or compassionate witnessing instead of frustration.
*   **Integration, Not Struggle:** Wholesome integration of the mind's parts can only happen in an atmosphere of **safety, comfort, and friendship.** This is contrasted with rigid, boot-camp-style retreats that enforce control through fear and regimentation, which often breeds internal rebellion.
*   **Practical Application:** This means gladdening the mind, talking yourself into feeling safe and secure, and seeing mistakes as learning opportunities, not failures.

### **The Goal: Natural Abiding in First Jhāna**
The endpoint of the integration process (**Pictures 8-10**) is likened to mastering **First Jhāna**, not as a trance state, but as a **skillful, abiding state of integrated well-being.**
*   **First Jhāna is Accessible:** It is described as a natural state of joy, safety, and comfort that we all dip in and out of. The skill is in learning to **cultivate and sustain it intentionally.**
*   **The Five Factors:** First Jhāna is built on: 1) Freedom from unwholesome thoughts (hindrances), 2) Applying the mind to the wholesome, 3) Sustaining it there, 4) The arising of **pīti** (joy/rapture), and 5) **Sukha** (happiness/pleasure). A relaxed body is a natural result.
*   **Cultivation Method:** Practice entering this state frequently (5-6 short sessions daily) by using the breath and wholesome self-talk to create feelings of safety and satisfaction ("wow, this breath is wonderful"). The goal is to carry this integrated, joyful state "off the cushion" into daily life.

### **Key Practical Takeaways**
1.  **Retreats vs. Seclusion:** Formal, rigid retreats can reinforce the forceful Stage 4 mentality. True practice, as the Buddha advised, is better done in genuine **seclusion** (e.g., a forest, empty hut) where you can learn to befriend your mind without external regimentation.
2.  **The Medium is the Message:** How you speak to yourself (the *medium*) is more important than the content. A critical tone triggers rebellion; a nurturing tone fosters integration. This applies to external relationships as well.
3.  **Start with Self-Nurturing:** By making friends with your own emotions and inner child, you build the stability to handle external conflicts with more grace and less reactivity.
4.  **Sati (Mindfulness) as a Skill:** Sati is the repeated remembering to return to wholesome, present-moment awareness—"waking up" again and again to cultivate a new habit.
5.  **Multiple Doors to Jhāna:** Entering this integrated state is easiest through **Dhamma discussion** (like this talk), followed by listening to, reading, reflecting on, and teaching the Dhamma. Formal sitting meditation is the fifth and most difficult method, reversing the typical Western emphasis.

### **Conclusion**
The entire talk emphasizes that the spiritual path is not about violent self-conquest but about **gentle, friendly integration.** By stopping the internal war between the critical parent and the rebellious child, we pet and befriend our "ox." This allows us to ride it home joyfully, culminating in a natural, abiding state of ease and happiness—the "old fat man" who has returned to the village simply to share his joy. The practice is the continuous, gentle redirection of the mind toward wholesome, joyful, and present-moment awareness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphor and story used in this talk is the **Ten Ox-Herding Pictures** (a classic series of Zen Buddhist images and poems). This metaphor structures the entire discussion of the spiritual path.

Here’s a breakdown of the metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Primary Metaphor: The Ox-Herding Story**
This is the central framework. The speaker walks through the stages, interpreting them as steps on the meditative path:
*   **Picture 1:** Realizing "something is there" – the beginning of seeking.
*   **Picture 2:** Actively going out to look for it – the start of the spiritual journey.
*   **Picture 3:** Catching sight of the ox – beginning to practice correctly.
*   **Picture 4 (The Critical Stage):** Trying to put a ring in the ox's nose and force it – where many get stuck, trying to control the mind with willpower and criticism.
*   **Picture 5:** Making friends with the ox – shifting to a gentle, nurturing relationship with the mind.
*   **Picture 6:** Riding the ox home – enjoying the integrated state of mind.
*   **Picture 7:** The ox disappears – with full integration, the separate "parts" (ox/herder) dissolve.
*   **Final Picture:** The old, fat, joyful man (Hotei) – representing complete integration and spreading joy effortlessly.

### 2. **Interpretations of the "Ox" Metaphor**
The speaker offers two psychological interpretations of what the "ox" represents:
*   **The Inner Child / Primitive Mind:** The rebellious, instinctual part that resists control. The struggle to force it is like a parent harshly disciplining a child.
*   **The Parent Ego State / Internal Authority:** The set of internal rules, laws, and critical voices. When integrated, this strict authority softens and disappears.

### 3. **Supporting Metaphors & Analogies**
*   **Herding Cats:** Used to illustrate the futility of "pushing" the mind. You can't herd cats by force; you attract them with food. Similarly, you attract the mind with nurturing, not force.
*   **Polishing an Old Table:** Represents the repetitive, gentle, nurturing work of meditation—rubbing in the polish with care, not just harsh scrubbing.
*   **The Refrigerator Door:** A metaphor for distracting, anxious thoughts that pull you out of the present moment (e.g., "Did I leave the fridge open?").
*   **The Bugger/Booger:** A vivid analogy for unwholesome thoughts. You don't just "let go" of a booger stuck on your finger; you actively "flick it off." Similarly, you actively discard unwholesome thoughts.
*   **Building a Brick Wall:** Contrasts the skilled bricklayer (experienced meditator) with the novice, illustrating how practice develops efficiency and beauty in the skill.
*   **Military Retreat:** Critiques the Western term "retreat," associating it with withdrawal from a disaster. Contrasts this with the Buddha's idea of "seclusion" (going to the forest, an empty hut), which is a proactive search for the "ox."
*   **The Medium is the Message:** Used to explain how the *tone* (critical vs. nurturing) of our internal or external communication matters more than the content. A critical internal voice creates rebellion, even if the words are "you should meditate."

### 4. **Referenced Stories & Texts**
*   **The Buddha's Realization under the Rose Apple Tree:** Referenced as an early childhood experience of first jhana, a natural state of joy and concentration.
*   **Hexagram 33 (Retreat) from the I Ching:** Introduced to contrast a "retreat" of respectful seclusion with one of fearful withdrawal.
*   **Sutta References:** The talk is grounded in references to Buddhist suttas (e.g., Anapanasati Sutta, Sutta 36, Anguttara Nikaya) to validate points about jhana, seclusion, and the path.

### Summary
The talk uses the **Ox-Herding Pictures** as its core narrative to map the spiritual journey from seeking to struggle, then to integration and joy. This primary metaphor is supported by a network of smaller, everyday analogies (cats, tables, brick-laying) and psychological frameworks (inner child/parent) to make the process relatable and to emphasize its key message: the path to integration is through **friendship and nurturing** of the mind, not through forceful control.
