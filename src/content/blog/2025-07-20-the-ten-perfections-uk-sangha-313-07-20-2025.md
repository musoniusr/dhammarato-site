### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello folks and welcome to the Sunday afternoon Dhamma Talk. We are actually just recovering from a rain spell. It was raining pretty hard. Mikey, in fact, got stuck and I was afraid he wasn't going to be making it back for the call, but he did show up and what a relief that is. So let's see, what's the date today? It is the 20th of July. And today, thanks to a question by Timo, we're going to be talking about the Parmis or the Paramita. Now, the word Parmi is used, let us say, more closely with Theravada And Paramita is more Mahayana. There's also a kind of a difference between the Paramita and the Parmi, but they're spelled the same except that you've got a T-I at the end of the Mahayana group. Now, we brought that topic up, Timo, based upon something that Ivan had said. But Ivan isn't here now, when we were talking about patience, which is Kanti. And Kanti is one of the items on the list of the Parmis. Now, the first thing that I want to say, in fact, I want to spend probably the whole time on this, is that the Parmis are nowhere in the suttas. They don't even show up until much later during the time of the commentaries, and also in the Jataka Tales, which is a huge volume, is part of the Tripitaka. But the Jataka Tales is a huge collection of stories that they just grabbed from everywhere. And most of them, in fact all of the Jataka Tales, have to do with the previous lives of the Buddha, which that's actually not the teachings of the Buddha. That you could say then that what had happened to the teachings of the Buddha was that it was turned into a religion, and that it was turned into a religion by and for ordinary people, and that one of the things that we need to look at doing is to come out of our ordinary way of looking at things which is basically past and future, into the noble teachings of the Buddha, which has to do with what's happening right now, right this very minute. And so these parmis is a list of things that was devised and developed by and for ordinary people who didn't really understand the teachings of the Buddha. That in fact everything on this list would probably be on some list in every religion. Let me read something, a little clip first. It says, the 10 Pāramitas, or perfections, are virtues systematically cultivated by a Bodhisattva over countless lifetimes to reach Buddhahood. They are mostly found in post-canonical Theravada literature, especially in the Jataka tales or in the commentaries. They're also echoed in the Mahayana as Paramitas, though with some variation. So I've just covered most of that, but this data that I just gave came from AI, and that we want to make sure that you understand that these paramis are not core teachings of the Buddha, but that each item that's in this list is somewhere mentioned in the suttas, but not as a list and not with that intention. Now let me read that intention again or go over it again, that these are things that are cultivated by a Bodhisattva over centuries, lifetimes, to reach Buddhahood. Now, the first thing that we can cover with that is, is that there is no distinction between a Buddhahood and a normal noble, especially one that would be considered an Arahant. And Sutta number 108, in fact, there is a conversation between a Brahman and Ananda after the Buddha's passing, and the question was, what is the difference between the— he was called Sakyamuni then, he referred to himself as Tathagata, and in modern times we refer to him as the Buddha. So what's the difference between those students who accomplished what the Buddha taught and the Buddha himself. Now, in Mahayana, they make a big distinction between the three things of Anagami, Bodhisattva, and Buddha, or Buddhahood. Within the Theravada teaching, though, the original teachings of the Buddha, The Bodhisattva is only someone who is seeking. In fact, the Satta also has the word Sukkha, and the word Sukkha actually refers directly to, in Indo-European language, a seeker, one who is out looking. And so the Buddha went from actually spending 6 years out searching looking, striving, and developing these things called the Parmītas, and then he had an awakening, a sudden awakening. That sudden awakening, by the way, happened because he was practicing the austerities of the Jains and had so weakened himself and so flagellated himself to the point that he slipped and fell into a creek, and could not get out of the creek. He was too weak, and he had that insight right then and there of, if I can't get out of this creek, how am I ever going to reach the goal with which I am interested in attaining? He also, during that time, redefined what the goal was, because even he during those times had some sort of magical idea of what it was, but he redefined that into what he actually teaches. And this is in several suttas, including Sutta 22 in the Mahayana, the simile of the snake, where he says both formally and now, I teach only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So what we can also look at is that that was a sudden awakening and that it was all it took. After that, he spent time formulating a way to look at it, examine it, and see it, and transmit it to other people. Because his first thought was, is that this is too profound, I'll never be able to convince anybody of it. But then he was able to put it into a language that he could understand and that way he could actually transmit this to other people. And yet, most of the people who were introduced to the teachings of the Buddha miss the whole point of the teaching. And so today, I would like to make that based upon these Paramitas, or these Parmis, because these are ordinary things. These are things that ordinary people they try to develop. They do it in Christianity, they do it in Islam, they do it in Buddhism. So let's go through the list first. The first item on the list is called Dana. Dana actually means generosity. We use the word in English as donation, to donate, to give, to be generous. And that the AI said that there was actually 3 kinds of donation. One would be to donate something trivial or something unimportant, like giving away used clothing or feeding the monks with leftovers, versus a middle path, which means to deliver something that's very valuable. Like $500 or $1,000 or your fortune or whatever. And then the highest one would be to give your life. Now, to say it like that misses the entire point of the teachings of the Buddha. But in fact, Ajaan Po at Wat Soan Mokkh made a particular point with me on a regular basis, and that is that the highest best gift that you can give someone is the Dhamma, the actual teachings of the Buddha. That's the best gift. So if you go around giving your life, becoming a martyr, getting nailed to a cross or something like that, that's not the highest gift that you can give. That, in fact, one little point about that, they say, the Christians say that Jesus died for your sins? How many of you have heard that? In fact, we just talked about that at great length. Jesus died for your sins, right? But he only spent a weekend dead, and after that he was resurrected. Well, if he was resurrected, that means he's back alive again. He took his life back again. Where's this salvation through his death? The fact is, is that in this, in the scriptures, it talks about it. And this is something that's quite important for the teachings of the Buddha, and that is, is that forgiveness does not require someone to sacrifice their life to forgive your sins. You can forgive your sins. That's all there is to it. Just forgive yourself. Stop moaning about it. Stop being afraid of hell. Stop being guilty. And just say, "I'm over that." But, like the Parmese, Christianity is built in an ordinary way, so that gift-giving, in the real sense of it, the real gift to give, is the real teachings of the Buddha. Now the problem with that is that you've got to know the real teachings of the Buddha, before you can give it away to somebody. That's where the real effort comes from, is to really know what you're talking about. So the next item on the list, in fact, this one is really telling because it's talking about development of Sila. Sila means morality. And that all religions have some sort of morality, says that you've got to be moral, you've got to be a good person. Well, even in ordinary Buddhism, we have that as the number one thing. In fact, some of the places for the monks, the training places, they require that the monks fit into the behavior patterns that are expected for a monk. And that training may be 2 years before they're given any more training than that, not recognizing that behavior is not the real training, that the real training is to train the mind, that the mind is the forerunner, that our body behavior is kind of slow, that it's impossible to rob a bank unless you've done the planning to rob the bank. You've gotten your ski mask, you've gotten your gun, you've gotten your note, you've gotten your trench coat, you've got all the— maybe a mask or something. You've got everything you need before you rob the bank, but you're not robbing the bank until you rob the bank. That's the Sila. But the Buddha teaches that we're not talking about your behavior, we're talking about your mind. And so this is what makes this Paramita especially ordinary for ordinary people. Now the third item on the list is called Nekkhamma, or renunciation, and I would like to talk about several different versions of this. Almost always we think of renunciation as a vow that we take. We take all kinds of vows. Christians are famous for their vows. We even have a vow for marriage. And that— let's do it this way: I vow to no longer eat shit sandwiches. I vow to never eat another shit sandwich. Now, the real renunciation has nothing to do with a long-term vow. What it really has to do with is right this very moment. And right this very moment, the vow of renunciation of not eating a shit sandwich is seen as that yuck. That's the renunciation. I renounce it right now because I can see it for what it is, and I'm not going to eat it right now. This is an important quality. —that we think that we're going to renounce our bad behavior, that we're going to renounce our mental states and all of that kind of stuff in advance, to where the real renunciation is not done in the sense of a vow, the way that the Bodhisattva is doing it, but in fact it's renouncing things that we know right now, can see them as they are right now, is not worth it. And so this is the way of looking at it. As ordinary, we take a vow for the long term, we're not going to do it, versus we renounce it when we see it. The next one on the list is actually the first one that I find that's of any value, and that is the word Pañña. Or wisdom, because this is the way that someone moves from the ordinary to the noble, is by developing wisdom. As I said before, the Buddha got insight: I can't get out of the creek that I'm in. How in the world am I ever going to get my final goal? That was instant. That was insight right then and there. So, what do we do to wake up? How do we develop this Pañña? One of the ways of developing the Pañña is by seeing in an ordinary way that this does not belong to me. An example of that is, many people are worried about Donald Trump. The reality is that they don't own Donald Trump; Donald Trump doesn't belong to them. Let Donald Trump do what Donald Trump is going to do, and let his real enemies deal with him in their own ordinary way. But it doesn't matter what you think about Donald Trump, you can't fix him. He doesn't belong to you. So, the best thing to do then, with wisdom, is to realize that that's not your business. In fact, what is your business? Your only business is freedom from Dukkha, freedom from worry, freedom from wanting things to be different than they are, and just allow things to be the way that they are. That's the insight that we need, but we need that every particular moment when we think we own something. That's the wisdom. Now, one of the ways that I have talked about wisdom before is looking at right now the way things are headed or the way things are pointing. And I use the example that when I was a teenager, there was an old man out with a group of people that were hunting, and he had his loaded shotgun draped over his left arm, and he was holding it up like this with the gun pointed down, not directly down, but just kind of downwards. And as he was talking and moving around, that shotgun was pointing at the kneecaps of various other hunters, and they didn't like that very much. The way the direction that a gun is pointed is the way that that gun is going to shoot when it goes off, which is exactly the way that we should look at wisdom. The way that your mind is pointed is exactly the way that it's going to cripple someone when it goes off. So be careful about the way your mind is pointing. That's the wisdom. The second item that has some value is Viriya and energy. Now the real point is effort, but we're not talking about the struggle of a seeker, a Bodhisattva. We're not talking about spending years of meditation and long time of doing stuff and whatnot like that. The effort that we're talking about that's needed is the effort right here, right now, to change your own mind with your wisdom, to be able to see the thoughts that you're having and make a change right now. The next item on the list— where's Ivan now? Has Ivan gotten here? This is his item. He asked about patience. Guess what? Patience is not mentioned anywhere in the suttas. Not mentioned anywhere. What do you think about that, Timo? Patience is not in the suttas. What do you think, Timo? Patience is not in the suttas.

**Speaker B:** I didn't know that. That's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Huh?

**Speaker B:** That's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I think one can still make it work. Like things you mentioned, patience also. Wouldn't it be Also just a skillful way to point the mind, like with the analogy of the gun, that like point the mind towards the direction of.

**Speaker A:** Being patient, being— Wouldn't it be wonderful if that's true? But it's not. It's not true. Okay. There's another word for you. You can use it'll help us. And that is patience is the same thing as tolerating. The child is noisy and we tolerate it, but we don't like it. Is that right? In other words, patience is kind of a forbearance of things that we don't like. Is that not true, Timo?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's the same thing as putting up with something that you don't want to put up with. Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so here comes the question. Mikey, I'll pick on you for a moment. Is it not a definition of Dukkha as putting up with things that we don't want to put up with?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that would be a definition of Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** All right, so in that— wait for you to turn your mic off. Okay, with that, that means then that patience, or Kanti, is a form of Dukkha right then and there. Why should you develop patience? All right, so what about developing patience for myself? Well, the development of patience for myself means that what I need to do instead of putting up with my own bad thoughts is to change them right then and there. To change them. This is a change model. The real teaching of the Buddha is not about patience. It's about change. Now I know that there's a lot of people who are Bodhisattvas, we've got a lot of them here on the group, and they have all the idea, "Oh, when I'm practicing correctly everything is wonderful, but sometimes I feel bad." 'Lord, give me patience to tolerate me feeling bad.' There is a prayer. I like it very much, and it says, 'Lord, give me patience right bloody now.' That's what we need for patience, is to make the change right now. Don't put up with things. Don't tolerate things. Don't forbear our own misbehavior, make a change to it. So that's why Kanti, or Santi, would be considered ordinary people. They need patience because they're not, let us say, developed enough to be able to just change what it is. For instance, if the kids are making noise, instead of tolerating and putting up with them and having patience with the kids making noise, Why don't I just go take a walk, get away from them? I don't have to put up with the kids making noise. I don't have to be around them. I can make a change myself. All right, the next one, number 7, is Sati, or truthfulness. Now, one of the things that we can say is that we do actually, in the noble Dharma, We are not truth seekers, that we are not looking for higher truth like other religions. Now basically what we mean by a higher truth is Christianity, for instance, trying to justify their Christian stories about trinities and dead man walking and crucifixion and salvation and no-sex babies and all kinds of things like this is their story, and they want their story to be true. In fact, the stories around Buddha are also just as irrelevant. The Christians can be happy all because they know that God loves them. That's enough story. The teachings of Jesus says, "Behold, the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, is within you." You are a temple. All you have to do is remember that. We don't have to go and pray and go to church and argue with atheists and try to figure out what's true or not. All we have to do is just be happy. But that seems to be not part of the Christian package anymore. No, to be a good Christian, you've got to be angry. You've got to be angry at wrongdoers. You've got to be angry at abortion. You've got to be angry at LGBTQ. You even got to be angry at immigrants. That anger seems to be the primary quality of Christianity, not love, not compassion, but setting the things straight. They want to have the truth be known. Well, often the truth is very wiggly. That in fact, if we wanted to teach a Christian how to be happy, we would not in fact try to tell them the truth, that all the Christian beliefs that you have is a bunch of garbage, because they're not going to accept that. So oftentimes it's better to avoid the truth in a noble way, but in an ordinary way, we seem to have gotten devoted to the truth. The next item on the list is called determination. Determination is very much like patience in the sense that determination has a quality of working hard. Never mind, start again. You've got to work. But this is not really the teachings of the Buddha. In fact, we could go so far— and I'm getting ready to start talking about this as the last item, not on the list but the real point of this talk— is that we work and we work and we work. We work for ordinary reasons, we work for sensual desire, and so when we come on a spiritual path, we work at that. The real point was that we can see in the life of the Buddha that he gave up that work. We have to quit trying and just be okay the way we are. So in fact, you could say that determination is not so much determination. A better way of looking at it in a normal frame of reference is to remember, to remember that you're already okay, to remember that everything is already all right. We don't have to be determined to make things correct. Because they already are ready. Okay, now the next item on the list is Metta, which means kindness, friendliness. Now, the Buddha was a big fan of this, but not in the sense of something that needs to be developed, but rather when your mind is noble When you are happy, when you are joyful, all you really want to do is to spread your joy. You don't have to work on liking people. That's the same, in fact, here, Metta, the way that it's talked about, is very, very much like patience. Let me be patient, let me tolerate those fools, rather than joyfully just acknowledging, hey, they're a bunch of fools, let's go have some fun with some fools. Now, the last item on the list is also quite noble in the sense it's called Upekkha, and Upekkha is equanimity. But equanimity, actually, that word I don't even like. It's a made-up word. It doesn't appear anywhere in the English language. Equanimous and equanimity are two English language words that were made up to try to understand what Buddha was talking about when they used the word Upekkha. So I'll give you a better definition of it, that instead of being, let us say, okay by putting up with tolerating, being determined to be all right, that Upekkha really has the quality of, I don't give a flying rip. If you don't care, then how can it be having patience for it? You just don't care. This is real Upekkha, is to be free. Now that we've covered all of these paramitas, let's start talking about the actual path of the Buddha. In Sutta number 10, there is a statement. It's in the Pali called Eka Yana Mago. Eka Yana Mago actually means like a straight path or a direct path to go immediately, just like in the, uh, the board game of Monopoly. Do not pass Go, go directly to jail. Well, here we're talking about do not go past all of your Gos past all of these Paramitas, develop them one at a time, go immediately to happiness. This is the real teaching of the Buddha. And yet everybody who ever practices always starts out with a hard path. You'll see people meditate for hours and hours and hours, but they're not really happy all of those hours. They're trying to develop happiness rather than actually just being happy, just being there. This is the real teachings of the Buddha, is to be able to see when you're not happy and go directly to happiness, make that change. Now, one of the things about these paramitas that's very interesting is the very key ingredient that we would say that's needed for the Eightfold Noble Path, that's on the Eightfold Noble Path, this that has that immediate result is to be able to remember to look at what's happening right now, to remember to look at what's happening right now and to make a change right now. This is the teaching. Well, if you're able to see what's happening right now, remembering to look, seeing what's happening right now, and make a change from being patient into not giving a flying rip Isn't that release? Isn't that freedom? Right then and there. This is the teaching of the Buddha, is to not go on a gradual path but to go immediately, right now. Whatever your problem is, drop it. But you've got to see what you're carrying first. So this actually gives a two-step operation that in some of the most important suttas, in fact of the three most important suttas, all of them end with this one point, and that is in English, Old English, we would say knowledge and deliverance. Well, this is actually what we would mean then by the word enlightenment, and by the way, the word enlightenment does not appear anywhere in the suttas. But it does have some value in understanding. So don't try to become enlightened. Instead, look at what you're doing. The word enlightenment has the word light in it, in the sense of lighten— well, actually turn the light on, the light of day. Shine a light on it. Get a torch out. Look at what's happening. Look and look and look and look and see what's there. And that's what we mean by then the knowledge is knowledge, and wisdom is because we keep investigating, we keep looking. We don't come to a conclusion, but in fact, if you look and you look and you look and you see what it is and come to a conclusion, the next time you look, it's changed. So don't come to a conclusion. A conclusion is in fact what you need when you're going to be determined. The conclusion is something that you need when you're patient. You've concluded that the kids are noisy. But if you listen and look closely, maybe the kids are having fun. Why don't I go enjoy their fun? Why should I just claim with my concept, my conclusion that they're noisy, when in fact that noisiness is actually in my own mind? Not in the mouth of the kids. So, this is the real path. These Parmitas are ordinary things developed by ordinary people that came centuries after the teachings of the Buddha, but the Buddha's teaching was the correct one, and we've turned his correct teaching into garbage. So there is a religion called Buddhism, just like there is a religion called Christianity, and both of them, as well as Islam, they're all garbage. They try to defend themselves and they try to work to find God, when in fact, here he is, he's right here. Behold, the kingdom of God is at hand. Wow, I found it already! Here it is. That's all we need to do is just to come back to right here, right now, and we've got everything we need. This is the teaching of the Buddha. So any training that we have, any skill development that we have, is number one, to remember to look at what's happening right now and make a change. That's the real work, except that it becomes really easy once you get used to it. Once you start doing it, becoming is easy. Well then, why then is Ivan asking for patience. Why don't he just change his.

**Speaker D:** Mind?

**Speaker A:** Just change your mind. You don't need patience. You don't need determination to put up with it. You don't need to work hard. You don't need to develop Upekkha or equanimity. Just don't care. Just throw it out. We don't care about it. So you see that an example would be the Christians always debate the atheist over two main issues. The primary issue is, does God exist or not? And so you'll say, the atheist will say, "No, he doesn't exist, I'm looking for proof, I need proof before I'll believe it." And the Christians say, "Your proof is all around you." But the noble teaching of the Buddha would say, "I don't care whether there is a God or not." That's not my problem. The other issue that they get off into is, um, what happened in the beginning? What's the source of all of this? This is in fact part of the ultimate truth, is how things got started. And so they'll say, oh, there's a Big Bang, and others will say there's a steady state. But the real noble idea is, is that I wasn't there, I don't know I don't care. All I care about is being happy right now. There's nothing left. We don't have to argue over what happened a long time ago, and we don't have to argue over magical beings. All we need to do is to just be happy. We don't need patience. We need to get over it. We don't need Metta. We're just friendly. We don't need renunciation. We don't need to take the vow of renunciation, "Oh, I'm not ever going to eat shit sandwiches." All we need is to say, "This is a shit sandwich and I'm not going to eat it right now." That's the real teachings of the Buddha, is to be here now. Enjoy the fact that everything is already okay. Right now. And guess what? You keep practicing that, you'll get really, really good at it. You practice being satisfied. This is good enough. That's really what the Buddha taught. He taught Dukkha, which means we're dissatisfied. We have to have patience because we're dissatisfied. We're putting up with something that we don't like. Why do we keep the 'I don't like it' part and then have to develop toleration for it? Why don't we just change my attitude? That's the real point of the teaching of the Buddha, is to change your attitude from 'I don't like it, it bothers me.' In fact, that's an attitude of a victim, and what we're going to change it to is the attitude of a winner. 'I can handle this.' I got no worries. Everything is great right now. Not a problem in the world. And we develop that, and pretty soon that becomes our motive of operation. That's our wisdom. The wisdom is seeing things right now, and everything is okay. I don't have shotguns in my mind pointing at people's kneecaps. So this is the way that we live our life, but we have to practice that because we are coming out of some pretty heavy-duty training. We are not only trained because of our DNA through our instincts, but everybody that we've been around has been living according to their instincts, training the child to go in the way of the way that they feel. When in fact the real training is to get over it, to look at what you're doing. That's the knowledge, and then the deliverance is just dropping it, just setting it down. We don't have to care about the Big Bang, we don't have to care about whether God exists, we don't have to care about the kids being noisy, we don't have to care about anything. In fact, the word "care" is the same as carrying. If you care about something, you're carrying it around. It's heavy. They say that angels can fly because they take themselves so lightly. So to become an angel, all you have to do is just take things lightly, including yourself. Don't have to worry anymore, don't have to tolerate anymore, don't have to put strong effort anymore. We don't have to seek the truth anymore. Because the truth that we need is right here, right now. The reality is everything's okay. The reality is Planet Earth has enough gravity to keep me grounded. It's got enough gravity to keep the breath going because we've got air. So we got everything that we need. We've got gravity. In fact, I even like to talk about gravity as what God is. What is God? Well, the Christians define God as Omniscient, omnipotent, all-present, all-powerful, and all-knowing, right? Isn't that the definition of gravity? It's always here. It'll always hold you down. You can't just jump up in the air and stay in the air. Gravity is going to make you come back down again. It always knows where you are. You can't go into the bedroom and hide from gravity. It's also pretty powerful stuff. Even Elon Musk has to deal with gravity. So let gravity be your guide. It's all-knowing, all-powerful, always present, here, now. Isn't that marvelous? We can stay on the ground. We don't have to fly off someplace. Let gravity hold us down. That's all we need. Other than that, our mind is light. So, who can I pick on? Ah, Caleb, what do you think about today's talk?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I thought that it was all pretty good. Don't really have much to say, but I'm gonna be keeping this all in.

**Speaker A:** Awareness and remembering this. Yes, remember, that's the main teaching, is remember to be here now. We don't need a long list of karmas or perfections that take lifetimes and lifetimes to develop. That all we're looking for is to feel good enough right here, right now. That's all we need. Oh, Carl, awesome, you changed your name. Hello, Carl, what do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say? Hello, Dhammarato. Um, I was gonna say, as far as patience A lot of times I think we see that word and it comes to another word, endurance. Endurance, exactly. I hear a lot, like patience equals endurance and that's how we perceive it in this training that we think we have to endure, we have to wait it out sometimes without taking an effort. But that patience only comes when you still the mind and as you use the example, you heard the cows and then eventually cows can can just chill by themselves once you have them under control. So to me, that's patience, that's endurance, but you have to take the right.

**Speaker A:** Effort. Yes, we can even say so far is why should we wait? The cows are going to come home all by themselves. So we don't have to wait on the cows. We don't have to endure the fact that they didn't come home. They'll come home. In fact, I'll say this about it, and, and, um, that, um, there is a, uh, a beast that is very common here in Thailand as well as in India. We call it a water buffalo. It's got black, uh, um, very short, uh, fur, big long horns, and is almost always fat. I think you know what I'm talking about, a water buffalo. In Thai, the word is kwa. So they're smart. They're much smarter, by the way, than cattle. And so what the Indians do is that they'll put the kwa with the cows and they become good friends. And the kwa always knows his way home to where cows will get lost. And so what the cows do is they follow the water buffaloes because the water buffaloes are not going to get lost. So when I say the cows come home, maybe they won't because they get lost, but if they got someone to follow, they'll make it. So, Animal, Animal, what do you think? Good to see you again.

**Speaker D:** Friend. Good to see you too, Dhammarato. It was a pretty good talk. It's good to remind that I don't have to aim for anything heavy duty, don't have to carry the weight of the virtues. The only practice is to remember to do it in the here and now, to drop the weight and reach Sukkha directly, don't have to endure anything, don't have to think about how you're going to change a habit or you're going to do something big, heavy duty. Just have to do it in the now, just have to remember.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you think something is heavy and you've got to do it, best thing to do is don't do it. If it's heavy, if it's dark, if it's hot, if it's something that you don't want to do and you think that you have to do it, my recommendation is don't do it. Instead, go off into seclusion and practice being happy. And after you get your mind happy and free and comfortable and you don't care about that job, now you can come back and do it happily. So don't do anything you don't want to do. Wait until you want to do it and then do it. You can wait 5 minutes, 10 minutes. So, Dhamma friend, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? I can't really say anything more than just what everyone already said. It's a good talk.

**Speaker A:** I hope I remember All right, so Timo, what do you think? This was not what you were expecting from the Parmis, was it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was kind of what I was expecting from you, actually. I thought it was gonna come out like that somehow. So it was a wonderful talk. I enjoyed it and gave me a good pause to reflect on my ordinariness that I have sometimes. I would say with your words, like sometimes you feel like a noble and sometimes you don't. But it was a great reminder.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I've used that before. It comes from the old Almond Joy commercial: sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. But in our case, sometimes you feel noble and sometimes you don't. Your job is to see that you're not noble right now and change it to the fact that you are noble right now. Drop whatever you're carrying. Drop that almond. So Dominic, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think?

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker B:** I feel light, like an angel.

**Speaker A:** All right, we got one angel. Good. How about you, Jesse? What do you think? Same.

**Speaker B:** I don't really have much to say. I like how simple this is and cutting away like, you know, these Paramitas and other things I've learned previously. I like that this is just more direct.

**Speaker A:** Direct. That's what the Buddha calls it. The Pali word is Eka Jhana. That's the path. Mago, the path. Direct. Just do it. That's all there is. Karwan, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? Dhammarato, that's a great call. I really liked it. I like especially the part where you.

**Speaker D:** Say that there is no such thing.

**Speaker B:** As enlightenment in the suttas and that.

**Speaker D:** There is no such thing as patience in the suttas.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, I enjoyed it. The only thing what I have still difficulty with is to truly be carefree and careless. I still care about many things, and I feel like if I give up those cares, I feel like selfish and egocentric to truly give up some cares that I have.

**Speaker A:** Right. So when you see that stuff, you can say, aha, I see you. You know, Jesus and Buddha operated the same way. Which was exactly opposite of the way that Muhammad operated. So when Jesus saw the devil, what did he say? Get thee behind me, Satan. Buddha said, aha, I see you. Aha, I see you, Mara. Same thing as the devil, the devil in our mind, the devil on our shoulder. What did Muhammad do? He says, ah, Gabriel. So we need to say, don't listen to our magical friends because they're actually part of our DNA. So, ah, Catherine, thank you for joining. Thank you for keeping the video on. What do you have to say? Welcome, my friend.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, lovely to meet you all. I really love the talk because I think when I was younger, I would often be faced with something I didn't want to do, and I could make a whole drama out of that. Poor me, suffering so much, but very dutiful, working so hard. But I mean, the Dhammas taught me that when you're faced with something that you you really don't want to do, but you have to do, you can just flick a switch up here. And instead, you can just take it so lightly and playfully. And you can just bring joy and fun. Why not just do it as well as you can do it with love and joy? And then you enjoy it, the people around you will feel that warmth and joy. And maybe you can just have fun with something you don't want.

**Speaker A:** And I love that. I'm glad that you got that out of the talk. Thank you for being here. So, Mr. Ben, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? Hey, Dhammarato, I joined very late and was riding a scooter, so honestly, I didn't have time to take in much of it, but thank you for the call.

**Speaker A:** Anyway. Glad to see you. So does anybody else have anything to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker B:** Um, I'll jump in really quick, uh, just to add to what you were saying. Uh, in the original Greek, the word repent was metanoia, which actually just means to change the mind. So in other words, change the mind here and now and be.

**Speaker A:** Happy. Yes. Actually, metanoia is exactly opposite of paranoia. Paranoia has the definition of, "The whole world is out to get me, to do me harm." And metanoia has the quality of, "The whole world is out to do good to.

**Speaker C:** Me.".

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. It's a wonderful place. It's awesome. That's the repent, the turning around from there's dangers out there into this is a park, this is a paradise. It's not dangerous. The danger is perceived, not real. All right, so Mikey, why don't you take this thing.

**Speaker C:** Home? Yeah, thank you, friends, for being here today. This is really such a joy to listen to this Dhamma talk and listen to the rain as well. Yeah, if you're new here, go ahead and check out the One-on-One Calls channel. You can leave a date and time there and have a one-on-one call with a seasoned practitioner here. We really enjoy making new friends, and there's quite a few noble friends here to be.

**Speaker A:** Made.

**Speaker C:** And also go ahead and check out some of the other channels as well. We've got Suttas, we've got a Wholesome Thoughts channel. There's a Dhamma content channel where people post Dhamma videos and things like that. So yeah, there's all sorts of fun little things to play with here on the Dhamma Friends Discord. If you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and hit like, hit subscribe, and share this video with a friend. Yeah, and you can also find these talks on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Podbean, etc. So yeah, thank you again, friends, so much for being here today, and take care. Enjoy this breath, enjoy this moment.

**Speaker A:** Don't worry, be happy. We've also got We've got a ladies-only channel, Captain. So we've got quite a number of ladies that are there. I hope that you can join them. They schedule calls right there in the ladies group so that you can make really good friends. Today we didn't talk about Sangha, but Sangha really is the real teaching of the Buddha, is to be friendly. To be friendly with yourself first and then to be friendly with others. And when you've got noble friends, we call that Sangha. And so I invite you to join the ladies' group and make some noble friends. We also have a website called Open Sangha Foundation. I hope everybody there is a member, but the most active place where we are is here on Dharma Friends. This is our main hangout place. But on the website, we've got a huge, huge, huge library. We've got a whole bunch of videos. We've got a number of PDF files. We have a library that has old Dhamma talks. We've got It's just massive. So go and join the Open Sangha Foundation for any kind of research that you want to do. But there's also places where you can post if you've got a long article or something that you want to share. It's good to put it on the group chats or in the blog post. Because on Discord things are happening so fast that the really excellent stuff just gets scrolled off, and it's hard to find something that happened 2 months ago. But it's easier on the website to find things. And so, uh, all your best work would be best if you put it on the, um, the website. So thank you all for coming. This has been a really good day. I've really enjoyed, um, turning up things turning things upside down for Timo, though he says he was ready for it. Okay, bye. We'll see you all. Thank you for coming.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Thank you, Dhammarato. Thank you. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a critical examination of the **Ten Pāramīs (or Pāramitās)**—virtues like generosity, patience, and wisdom often cultivated in Buddhist traditions. The core argument is that these are **later, "ordinary" additions** to Buddhism that obscure the Buddha's original, direct, and immediate teaching.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **1. Origin & Critique of the Pāramīs**
*   **Not Found in the Suttas:** Dhammarato states the Pāramīs are absent from the early Buddhist suttas (discourses). They appear later in commentaries and Jātaka tales, which are stories about the Buddha's past lives.
*   **For "Ordinary" Religious Practice:** They represent a "religious" turn in Buddhism, crafted for ordinary people who think in terms of past and future, and who seek gradual self-improvement over countless lifetimes (like a Bodhisattva path).
*   **Common to All Religions:** The virtues listed (generosity, morality, patience, etc.) are generic and can be found in many religions, thus missing the unique, radical core of the Buddha's teaching.

### **2. The Buddha's "Sudden" & Direct Path**
*   **The Buddha's Awakening:** The Buddha's own enlightenment is framed as a **sudden insight** (e.g., realizing his weakness in a creek prevented him from reaching his goal), not the result of gradually perfecting virtues over lifetimes.
*   **Eka Yāna Maggo:** The true teaching is the **"direct path"** (referencing the Eka Yāna Maggo from the suttas). The goal is immediate freedom from *dukkha* (suffering/stress), not a slow accumulation of perfections.
*   **Core Teaching Simplified:** The Buddha taught only about *dukkha* and its cessation. The path is about **changing your mind in the present moment**, not patiently enduring or determinately perfecting yourself.

### **3. Analysis of Key Pāramīs**
Dhammarato reviews the list to contrast the "ordinary" interpretation with the "noble" application of the Buddha:
*   **Dāna (Generosity):** The highest gift is not material or even one's life, but **the gift of the true Dhamma**.
*   **Sīla (Morality):** True training is of the **mind**, not just outward behavior. The mind's intent is the forerunner of action.
*   **Nekkhamma (Renunciation):** True renunciation is not a long-term vow, but a **present-moment letting go** upon seeing something as unworthy ("a shit sandwich").
*   **Paññā (Wisdom) & Viriya (Energy):** These have value. Wisdom is seeing things as they are *now* (e.g., "I don't own this problem"). Energy is the **effort to change your mind right now**.
*   **Khanti (Patience):** **Strongly critiqued.** Patience is equated with tolerance and endurance, which is itself a form of *dukkha* (putting up with what you dislike). The Buddha's teaching is about **change, not patience**. Instead of tolerating a noisy child, change your attitude or situation.
*   **Metta (Loving-kindness) & Upekkhā (Equanimity):** These arise naturally from a happy, noble mind. Metta isn't about forcing kindness; it's the natural radiance of joy. True *upekkhā* is **not caring** in a burdensome way, not detached tolerance.

### **4. The Practical Method: "Here and Now"**
*   **Two-Step Operation:** The essence of practice is:
    1.  **Knowledge (Look):** Remember to look at what is happening in your mind **right now**.
    2.  **Deliverance (Change):** See the clinging or dissatisfaction and **immediately drop it, change your attitude**.
*   **The Goal is Already Here:** The talk repeatedly emphasizes that happiness and freedom are available **immediately**. You don't need to earn them through lifetimes of virtue. "Everything is already okay right now."
*   **Drop the Weight:** Spiritual life is about **lightening the mind**, not carrying the heavy burden of perfecting virtues. The attitude shifts from a striving seeker (Bodhisattva) to one who sees and releases in the present.

### **Conclusion & Participant Responses**
*   Dhammarato concludes that religions (Buddhism included) often become "garbage" systems of striving, while the Buddha's core message is about **present-moment freedom**.
*   Participants in the talk generally affirm the message, appreciating its simplicity and directness. They resonate with the idea of dropping heavy duties and finding ease and lightness by dealing with the mind in the present.

**In essence, this talk is a provocative call to reject gradual, virtue-based religious paths in favor of the Buddha's original prescription: a direct, investigative, and transformative engagement with the present moment to achieve immediate release from suffering.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to contrast "ordinary" religious striving with what he presents as the Buddha's direct, present-moment teaching. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **The Shit Sandwich:** This is the central, recurring metaphor for things we should renounce.
    *   **Usage:** Used to explain *Nekkhamma* (renunciation). The speaker argues that true renunciation is not a long-term vow (e.g., "I vow to never eat a shit sandwich again"), but an immediate, present-moment recognition: "This is a shit sandwich and I'm not going to eat it **right now**."

2.  **The Pointed Shotgun:** A metaphor for *Pañña* (wisdom) and the direction of the mind.
    *   **Story:** A hunter carelessly points a loaded shotgun at others' kneecaps while talking. The speaker says, "The way that a gun is pointed is the way it's going to shoot... The way that your mind is pointed is exactly the way that it's going to cripple someone when it goes off." Wisdom is being aware of where your mind is "pointed" (i.e., what it's focused on and its intent) in the present moment.

3.  **Gravity as God:** A metaphor to demystify the concept of a higher power and anchor it in the present.
    *   **Usage:** To counter theological debates, the speaker humorously suggests that **gravity** fits the Christian definition of God (omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient): it's always here, powerful, and knows where you are. The point is: "Let gravity be your guide... Our mind is light." The real work is mental, not cosmological.

4.  **Carrying/Caring as a Burden:** A play on words to illustrate *Upekkha* (equanimity).
    *   **Usage:** "The word 'care' is the same as *carrying*. If you care about something, you're carrying it around. It's heavy." True equanimity (*Upekkha*) is not tolerance but not carrying the burden in the first place: "I don't give a flying rip."

5.  **Cows and the Water Buffalo (*Kwa*):** A metaphor for following wisdom.
    *   **Story:** Cows, who get lost, follow the smarter water buffalo who knows the way home. The implied lesson is: don't be a lost cow relying on patience/endurance; follow the "water buffalo" of immediate wisdom and change.

6.  **Angels Fly Because They Take Themselves Lightly:** A metaphor for the result of practice.
    *   **Usage:** To encourage letting go of burdens. "To become an angel, all you have to do is just take things lightly, including yourself."

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Buddha's Awakening at the Creek:** This is the core story framing the entire talk.
    *   **Narrative:** The Buddha, weakened from austerities, slips and falls into a creek. He can't get out and has a sudden insight: "If I can't get out of this creek, how am I ever going to reach the goal?" This moment of present-moment desperation leads to his awakening. The speaker uses this to argue for a **sudden, insight-driven awakening** versus the long, gradual cultivation of perfections (*Paramitas*).

2.  **The "Lord, give me patience right bloody now" Prayer:** A humorous story to critique the concept of patience (*Kanti*).
    *   **Usage:** To show the absurdity of asking for more patience (which he defines as a form of *dukkha* - suffering/tolerance) instead of simply changing one's mind in the present moment.

3.  **Jesus Died for Your Sins... But Was Resurrected:** A critical story about Christian doctrine.
    *   **Usage:** To argue that the Christian narrative is contradictory ("He took his life back again. Where's this salvation through his death?") and to make the point that **forgiveness does not require sacrifice**; you can simply forgive yourself now.

4.  **Robbing a Bank (Planning vs. Action):** A story to distinguish between mind and behavior in discussing *Sila* (morality).
    *   **Usage:** The planning to rob a bank happens in the mind; the act itself is secondary. True morality, according to the speaker, is about training the mind "the forerunner," not just controlling outward behavior.

5.  **Donald Trump is Not Your Business:** A contemporary anecdote for *Pañña* (wisdom).
    *   **Usage:** To illustrate that wisdom involves seeing what is "not your business" (things you don't own or control, like other people) and focusing your business only on "freedom from *dukkha*" right now.

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose:**
The metaphors and stories are not random. They serve a clear dual purpose:
*   **To Deconstruct:** They vividly mock and dismantle what the speaker calls "ordinary" religious practice—gradual striving, vows, patience, dogmatic truth-seeking—by comparing it to eating shit sandwiches, pointing shotguns, or carrying heavy burdens.
*   **To Illustrate:** They provide concrete, often humorous, images for his preferred "noble" path: a light, immediate, present-moment switch in perception that leads directly to happiness, like seeing the shit sandwich for what it is, dropping a burden, or following the wise water buffalo home.

The talk uses these narratives to argue that the *Paramitas* are a later, "ordinary" list, while the Buddha's true teaching is the **"Eka Yana Maggo"**—the direct, immediate path of seeing and releasing *dukkha* in the present moment.
