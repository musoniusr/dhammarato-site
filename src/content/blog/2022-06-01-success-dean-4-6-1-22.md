### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Very well, but I'm after getting a small bit of a spiritual ego. How do I fix it? Now I know I wouldn't be getting that if I wasn't still living in hindrances, but I'm starting to get a spiritual ego.

**Speaker B:** Spiritual ego? I don't understand.

**Speaker A:** No, ego.

**Speaker B:** What? Tell me what you're talking about.

**Speaker A:** Because my practice is going well and I've found that like I'm being a lot more generous for the right reasons, for good reasons. But because of that and because I'm living better, I kind of— there's a small bit of arrogance growing, if that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so what is the problem with arrogance?

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't want to have a bit of an ego. I don't want people to think I'm a dick. Not that I really care about what people think of me, but I feel it's because of my good practice and I'm going well, I'm living well, I'm getting on well with people, I feel that's making me a small bit arrogant.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's put it this way. You were mentioning nobles a moment ago. Would a noble be arrogant?

**Speaker A:** I don't think so, even though I don't think I've ever met anyone, only you.

**Speaker B:** All right, would you think then that someone could make a mistake and consider someone that is noble arrogant when in fact he's not?

**Speaker A:** Well, I give you an example.

**Speaker B:** I was walking through— No, no, answer my question.

**Speaker A:** Um, could they go think he's arrogant, but he might be not? I'm sure that's possible.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is, because people are foolish about all kinds of things. I mean, they murdered Jesus, didn't they?

**Speaker A:** True.

**Speaker B:** They poisoned Socrates, didn't they? They did. All right. And that there was at least more than, I think, 4 occasions when someone tried to take the Buddha's life, and that in the end he was poisoned just like Socrates.

**Speaker A:** Serious?

**Speaker B:** Not. That's exactly what happened.

**Speaker A:** Wow, I didn't know that.

**Speaker B:** It's in two places. It's in the Upadana, and then it's in the Mahayana, Parinibbana Sutta, Dhamma 16, and the Dhamma Nakaya. Okay, and what poison it was, they're still trying to figure it out, whether it was mushrooms or bad pork. They don't know because we don't know the translations of the Pali words.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, so here's the point then, that ordinary people make ordinary mistakes all the time. They don't know what they're looking at. Now let's take it from the other perspective. The noble actually has higher quality behavior because he has more noble thoughts, which means they're not unwholesome thoughts. Right. And yet he knows that his then morality is higher, superior to the ordinary person.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So knowing that one is better than someone else is not a problem. That in fact, real arrogance is when somebody is pretending to be better than someone else. So if a grandmother goes out in the yard and finds a baby animal, she'll pick up the animal and take it into the house and nurture it and take care of it, right? Because she's compassionate and she understands that this animal needs help and that she can give it help. Does that make her arrogant?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well then you and I have a different definition of the word arrogant, because I see being arrogant as absolutely fine. It's okay. It's a recognition that you're actually better than other people. Just don't rub it in. Take care of them instead.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I tell you one thing, I told you that I've experienced a few days of the jhanas. I don't know what, even when I came out of them, I still, I think for fucking a couple of weeks later, I was a better person even just after experiencing them for a few days. Would that be right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, things linger on. The skills that you were developing that got you into the first jhana, those skills are still there. You develop them as skills. If you let them— if they fall into disuse, they'll get rusty. So you have to keep them going. You have to keep exercising right noble thinking. But there is residual benefit that if you get into the habit of thinking in a wholesome way, then later you you'll just automatically begin to think in more wholesome ways. Not an issue, not a problem, it's expected.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay Dhammarato, so I wanted to get the spiritual ego question out of the way first. So I go to the gym a lot, okay? When I'm in the gym, I can get in and around the first Jhana, because I can get a momentum of wholesome thoughts, one after the other, and I'm mindful of what I'm doing in the gym. However, it doesn't feel as joyful as the first Jhana I've experienced that I got from meditation. But would the Jhana I'm getting in the gym, would that have as much benefit as the Jhana where I'm really, really joyful?

**Speaker B:** It depends upon the skills that you're including and in use. That in fact, in the gym, Most people who are in the gym are in the gym because they want something with the thought process of no pain, no gain. So that whole point about stressing the body to exercise it puts the body in a state of discomfort. If the body is in a state of discomfort when you're exercising, then that's going to detract from the Sukkha, which has comfort built in. So that's the answer to your question. Are you comfortable? Can you get comfortable while you're working out?

**Speaker A:** Oh, big time, big time. And I can see now why yoga is beneficial for some spiritual work, because a lot of time after I do my legs, I'm stretching. And when I'm stretching, I'm focusing on my stretch. But I'm also using wholesome thoughts and that really gets the fucking whole— I'm able to use that. The gym is actually more enjoyable since I'm practicing my fucking spiritual work in the gym with my lifting weights. And I can get into a wholesome thought after wholesome thought for a good bit in and around the first Jhana, but it's not as joyful as the first Jhana I've experienced from meditation. And that's probably because you mentioned the oxygen going into the brain. From the breath, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that in fact, maybe you have heard of this before, but there is a second and a third heart, that we have more than one heart. One of them is in the chest, and that's what does most of the pumping. But leg muscles, when you're out walking or running or weightlifting or doing anything that's exercising the muscles in the legs, when When you contract that muscle, guess what? It pushes blood. Where does it push the blood? Up. So you relax it and the blood comes down, back down through the arteries and whatnot. And when the muscles contract, then the blood is squeezed up back into the arteries. I mean, the muscles of the legs perform exactly the same function as the muscle of the heart. But the muscle in the heart is a little more sophisticated. But that's all. This is why people who are exercising and on walks, they can gain great benefit out of it simply because they're oxygenating the body to do so. Right. As well as breathing. There's some people, in fact, would say that most of the benefit from exercise doesn't come exactly from the exercise itself. It comes from the cardiovascular changes. It's not the muscles that gain all the benefit. It's the fact that you're breathing better.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And going and taking a walk, people breathe better than when they're just sitting. This is why in Anapanasati, we've taken emphasis upon the only exercise that we're going to do is the exercise of breathing, but we're going to do that very well. So that's why, that's why we practice Anapanasati. But walking meditation also is getting that cardiovascular system going.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so tell me this. I have tried walking. I'm fucking trying my meditation in all my life. When I'm walking in the car, when I'm walking around the house, when I'm walking anywhere. Can you give me like— I'm focusing on my movement when I'm walking and I'm focusing on my breath sometimes. Is it as simple as that? Walking meditation?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Being in the here and now, focusing on the walking, focusing on the breathing, being in the present moment has a great deal of benefit as compared to worrying about the argument you had with Aunt Jane 2 weeks ago.

**Speaker A:** Brilliant. Yeah, and you know what, this is going to tie into another question as well because I was watching an old video of you and Danny a couple of years ago and you spoke about, you know, you spoke about to have all your senses open and not to take an object and just let happen whatever happens and that's what I was doing. In my run, and it was a very enjoyable run. I was just letting my awareness fucking fluctuate up and down my body to the different senses, to the breath hitting off my face, or to the wind hitting off my face, my hair blowing, my legs hitting the ground. And it was a lovely run I had. And Buddhadasa talks about it as well, Dhammarato. He talks about heaven arises at the senses. So can you use that as a meditation?

**Speaker B:** Just let— that is the meditation, is your senses. So long as it's the five senses, the sixth sense is the mental, which in fact is conceptualizations. And everything that we conceptualize is something from the past. But all the other five senses, when we take data in, it's brand new data in the present moment. So staying in your sensory awareness is the only way to stay in the here-now.

**Speaker A:** And is that what gives you— is that what shows you what true reality is, when you can get all them senses opened up working together, or at the little separate mind moments? Is that what shows you impermanence or something like that?

**Speaker B:** Or— well, it's much more real that there is a whole lot of reality that you will never have anything for. Because you cannot accept that data, that you can only accept the data that comes in the five senses. But most people are not even taking in the data that's available in the five senses because they're too busy thinking about something. They're too busy processing rather than sensory input.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, so say if you got really good at opening up all your senses and being here now, would that be enough to make you get you into nobility? If you got really good at opening all your senses, opening all yours?

**Speaker B:** When you are in your senses, that is noble. Don't make the kind of distinctions that you're making. You, you, you have a lot of Western ideas about attainments and things like this. And these things are quite natural. The problem with the word Jhana is that Western Buddhism has made a big deal out of it. During fact, it's a natural state of being.

**Speaker A:** I tell you something, from my experience with it, it is a fucking big deal because it was pretty nice.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is nice, that's right. But it is not special in the sense of an attainment, that there is nothing to attain. There are merely skills to be developed.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** That Jhana is not an attainment. It's something to be enjoyed.

**Speaker A:** It's probably— that's probably what's stopping me from getting right there to the good one now, because I'm kind of Oh, when is it going to come? When is it going to come? Not all the time, but sometimes.

**Speaker B:** And I know, okay. And when it— when you are asking, when is it going to come? When is it going to come? Imagine there you are standing at the bus stop waiting for the bus to come, and you're having the thoughts, when is the bus going to come? When is the bus going to come? And you look at your watch and the bus just came and left you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** That's really what's going on. When's it going to come? When's it going to come? You missed it. Okay, you always are missing it because actually the right way of saying this is, when is it going to come? When is it going to come? Means you want something that you don't have and you're waiting for it to come. Yeah, guess what? Never does because you're already now in a state of wanting something that you don't have. You have to come out of the state of wanting something that you don't have and be happy and satisfied with that which you do have, because you can become comfortable and satisfied and happy right now. That's the state of the Jhana. When you want Jhana, you're not in a state of Jhana. You're in a state of desire. Okay, Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** I've heard you say that a couple of times.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point. It's that you need to stop wanting jhanas or wanting something and just relax and enjoy what you've got. And that's the jhana, is to relax and enjoy.

**Speaker A:** I've been watching who would have started on his, his, uh, his training, or his this, but he's doing like what I'm doing on his practice. Would have started around the same time as me, and he was getting into the Dhamma, Jhanas, around the same time as me as well.

**Speaker B:** Scott, well, you don't know that. You just hear what he's saying, right? So, okay, yeah, yeah, because you don't know. No one knows the state of one— of anyone else's mind, okay? You don't know what he— just because he said something doesn't make it true, and it doesn't also— even if it's true, doesn't mean anything. Until jealousy comes in. Oh, he's got something I want.

**Speaker A:** I'm not feeling like that now.

**Speaker B:** If you want something that you don't have— when is it going to come? When is it going to come? And he's got it. Then of course jealousy is going to be there. That's the part of jealousy, is I want something that I don't have. I tell you what, most of the time people want something that somebody else has rather than wanting something that doesn't exist. That's very, very rare.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, do you know what? I have a small little business as well, okay? And since I got it, I got a little attachment. I got an attachment to money that I never had before. But after the few days of a really gladdened mind. My attachment to money still has not come back. I'm a lot more generous even after that.

**Speaker B:** Well, congratulations for that. Gratitude and generosity is a noble trait that we can develop, a skill to be developed.

**Speaker A:** Well, I didn't try to develop it. It just developed naturally from my practice for some reason.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So that's strange, but it's good.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you have generosity feelings but you don't practice it by giving something to someone, then that's not going to mean much. So you actually are practicing it when you are generous.

**Speaker A:** Well, fair enough. It's more of us on a subconscious level. So I think, well, when you feel.

**Speaker B:** Good about yourself, then you don't feel like you need so much. That you've got enough. When you practice having enough, generosity is a natural outcome of having the attitude that you've got enough. Okay, in fact, it's not just enough. You become absolutely wealthy, wealthy with the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** And when you're— when your mind is really gladdened— oh my God, sometimes I struggle to sit for 10 minutes. Oh, I could have fucking sitted for 24 hours in my meditation when when my mind was gladdened, it was unbelievable. At one stage, Dhammarato, I had a little experience where it was like in my mind I zoomed in on my pineal gland and zoomed back out. It happened very quickly, but I— Do you know what that was about? I think it mightn't have even been my pineal gland, but something zoomed in. It's like in my head— The word.

**Speaker B:** Pineal gland is a concept. Okay, that where the pineal gland is inside the body. And so you can pay attention to where the pineal gland is inside of the body. There's actually two of them on both sides of the back of the head. And it's okay to pay attention to the back of your neck. It's okay to pay attention to your throat. Then in fact, the amygdala is very close to the back of the throat, that area of the brain that generates fear. And so paying attention to what the mind and the brain is actually doing through sensation is a very good practice. And it's right here, right now. You're not thinking about or feeling the pineal gland the way that the pineal gland was last month. You're feeling the way that it is right here, right now. Or at least you're experiencing the back of the neck, the back of the head. So that would be the way of beginning to think about it rather than naming it. Just stay with the sensations of it.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know what you call— well, I suppose you would call it was like I could see it. It just zoomed in and zoomed out. It just happened very quickly. But anyway, that was only an experience. So, Camille, do you know of any— I've been looking for any— is there any good meditation or Buddhist centers in around the UK or Ireland that you know of that might do retreats? There's one here in Ireland I think it's called Dot Chen or something like that, but they're charging a lot of money, and if they charge a lot of money Does that mean that there might not be nobles there? Or if there were nobles, would they be charging a lot of money?

**Speaker B:** Like, um, first off, I will say that this is my opinion, but that my opinion has a lot of backup that is based upon a lot of knowledge of things in the past, in the sense of what's in the suttas, the way that the monks operate, and all kinds of things like that. I've come to the position that Western Buddhism is primarily broken by money, and that anyone who is teaching the Dharma and wanting money from it has no Dharma to give.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** They're selling something they don't have.

**Speaker A:** That's enough said.

**Speaker B:** And one of the things about it, we've just talked about generosity. Someone who is charging money is not practicing generosity, now are they? No. Okay. So how can someone teach generosity if he's not exhibiting it to his students? Students, then in fact the students will try to emulate the teacher. They'll want to start charging money the same way that he does.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So one can then say then that someone who is charging money for whatever they're doing loves money more than what they're doing.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** An example of that is a dentist. Someone who is a dentist and really loves to be a dentist, he's probably going to do more pro bono work, that he's going to do dentistry on someone just because they need it. But most dentists are in it for the money. Okay, most psychologists are in it for the money. Okay, so the psychology comes second place, or the dentistry comes second place, and the primary point is eating first and helping others second, which is fair enough.

**Speaker A:** To a certain extent.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's fair enough for the ordinary world, it's fair enough for the masses, it's fair enough for the 7 billion. Okay, okay, but it is not noble. That the noble is the one who holds the Dhamma as number one in his life. But that's actually the practice of becoming a Srotapanna is dedication. And when I say dedication, that's not the right word, nor is the word devotion. The correct word would be eagerness.

**Speaker A:** Eagerness.

**Speaker B:** Eagerness, enthusiasm. That we— that that's all that we want. That in the suttas, one of the stories is the story of a cow who has a new calf. And while she is eating grass, she still has an eye on that calf. She's looking after that calf and she's going to position her body between the forest and the field. Or let us say in the field that she's in, she's going to position her body in order to give the calf the most safety. She only cares about the calf. OK, the second item on that list then would be the monk who is in the wat, even though he's got monthly duties like sweeping or carrying water or something like that. He still is more interested in the Dhamma, but that's what he really cares about. And the sweeping, he'll do the sweeping. But while he's doing the sweeping, his eye is on the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Enthusiasm. Okay. This is what we're looking for. Just enthusiasm and eagerness for the Dharma. When the Dharma becomes the important thing, then groceries or eating becomes secondary. It's not important. Now, monks in the watch, they already have the lunch taken care of. They go on vendabat. It's a tradition that works. Also, you can think of that the vendabat, or the going out for alms food, going to people's houses to get their leftovers from yesterday's meal, is an act of allowing the person to be generous. While the monk is exhibiting gratitude. Okay. So the whole idea of generosity and donations is well, well defined within Buddhism. But guess what? It is in all religions that part of the Christian teaching is to be generous, to take care of one another. And this is why they don't charge money for Christianity. So in fact, in that regard, I would say that Christianity has a leg up on Western Buddhism because Western Buddhism has bought into the business model and Christianity has managed to stay out of it. Now, Asian Buddhism is in that generosity model, dana. Everything is open and freely available and we share. It's commune. Anicca, because we live in community with one another and we share. But Western society is capitalistic. Okay. Which means that that's where the ego or that's where the money is, or I'm taking benefit. And it becomes a business deal, a business arrangement. Now, in almost all business arrangements, Let me ask you this in this way. If you were buying something and it was at price X, wouldn't you like to have a discount? Would you like for it to be X minus Y, or do you really want to pay X for it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I suppose. Yeah, of course I'd like a discount. Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right. So that's the whole point is, is that when one charges money for something, then he is actually breaking the second precept, because in the second precept we only receive that which is freely given. But when somebody doesn't want to give freely, they are paying the price. They don't want to pay the price, but they're willing to pay the price because they want the benefit. Then the person who is requiring them to pay the price is actually not taking the money that's freely given. It's coerced.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so what we're looking for is freely given. That's why I don't charge any money for anything. I don't even advertise. I don't even take dana. I give my teachings freely because it came to me from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po freely. They really helped me. They cared about me. And they wanted my own benefit. They did not charge me money for it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, who did you say was it? Ajahn Poh or Ajahn Chah? You said asked you to come on to the online and start doing what you're doing here on YouTube.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Who did you say asked you to come online, what you're doing now? Was it Ajahn Poh or Ajahn Chah?

**Speaker B:** Ajahn Poh.

**Speaker A:** So you were more friendly with him first before Buddhadasa? You said he always looked after you or something, is that what you said?

**Speaker B:** Yes, my main connection was with Ajahn Po.

**Speaker A:** And how did you become more friendly with Buddhadasa then?

**Speaker B:** Through Ajahn Po. Okay, okay. But that's— yeah.

**Speaker A:** I'm surprised then that you didn't take— did you have Ajahn Po as a teacher so as well as Buddhadasa?

**Speaker B:** The word Ajahn Anagami is the word for teacher.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so they were both your teacher? Mm-hmm. And Dhammarato, this is a question I wanted to ask you as well. I've heard you saying a couple of times you meditated for 10 years before you came to Buddha Dasa. I think it was 10 years, and you meditated for another 5 years when you were with Buddha Dasa. So does that mean you don't meditate anymore?

**Speaker B:** What is meditation anyway?

**Speaker A:** But you know what I mean? You know what I mean? Come on now.

**Speaker B:** But like, I did not, nor do I ever recommend anyone do anything that is called meditation that copies something from Mahasi or Goenka or Hinduism or any of that kind of stuff. Then in fact, if there is a meditation that I would recommend, it's to remove unwholesome thoughts and put wholesome thoughts in the place. And that's not taught in Goenka, and that's not taught in Mahasi. That's taught by the Buddha, is to remove unwholesome thoughts and put wholesome thoughts instead, to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind. And with that, that's the beginning of Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Okay, my little Mandala has run up and down the hall, Dhammarato. I don't know if you can hear him, but I just want to give you one more quick question, if that's okay. From your experience, what are the mechanics of the first Jhana that makes it the path to enlightenment? Does it quench the ego, or is it the fact that it just gets.

**Speaker B:** Rid of the whole Being in first jhana is being enlightened. And when you are in the first jhana, you are enlightened. And when you're not in first jhana, you're not. Now, it's not a matter of progression and progression. Let us say many people have the idea that it's kind of like we live on a plateau and we've got a long distance over to that edge of that plateau. And when we reach the edge of it, we jump off the edge and now we're in free fall over the edge. And that's not at all what it's like. In other words, we have in our system of thought, in Western thought, we have a clock or we have a time frame or we have the idea of not now, later. And the teachings of the Buddha and the whole mindset is about what are we doing right now? What are we doing right now? If we are gladdening the mind right now, then we're gladdening the mind right now. If we're enlightened right now, then we're enlightened right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And when we're not in gladdening the mind, then we're not enlightened. And we go up and down, back and forth. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. The question is, can you begin to control that cycle So that you spend more time in being wholesome and less time being in Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Well, I can't— you know what?

**Speaker B:** And the answer to that is, can you remember? That's the Sati. Can you remember to come out of your crap and come into a good state of mind?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but sorry, here's my little man in there now. Thanks for taking the call, Dhammarato. And, uh, yeah, I tell you, for the few days I was in first Jhana, considering how I used to live, I was fucking pretty enlightened for them few days, I tell you.

**Speaker B:** So all you have to do is sustain it. To get yourself into it is first skill, and then being able to maintain it, which means that you don't allow unwholesome thoughts to come back into the mind.

**Speaker A:** And is it possible to continue that good joyous feeling day after day after day for weeks and weeks on end?

**Speaker B:** No. Minute after minute after minute is the only goal that you should have. Can I sustain it for a little while longer? Let me get it another 1 minute.

**Speaker A:** Well, can you do it? Minutes and minutes and minutes off into the future that turn into days and days and weeks and weeks off into.

**Speaker B:** The future we don't know about. We only know about right now. So become oriented towards right now. When you think about it off into the future, that brings in desire.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but would you know, like, when you're in first Jhana for a long amount of time, does it not use up some kind of resources, say like dopamine or something like that, and then you're all flat after a long period of time being in first Jhana?

**Speaker B:** No, what you're saying is you don't like it when you came out of first Jhana. So why don't you just get yourself right back into it? Because after all, it's nothing but an attitude.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, there was a taste of something that was a bit more— there was something else in there. It was a bit more just an attitude. I think there was a feeling, the physical feeling of joy in there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's also an attitude.

**Speaker A:** Is it? How are you, baby? Hey, go on, Dhammarato, thanks very much, and I'll chat to you again.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** You will indeed.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), addresses several interconnected themes centered on practical Buddhist practice, with a primary focus on **overcoming spiritual ego and understanding the nature of Jhana (meditative absorption).**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. Addressing "Spiritual Ego"**
*   **The Concern:** Speaker A worries that as his practice improves (increased generosity, better conduct), he feels a growing sense of arrogance or "spiritual ego."
*   **Dhammarato's Reframing:** Dhammarato redefines the issue. He distinguishes between true arrogance (pretending to be better than others) and the simple, factual recognition that one's behavior has become more skillful and wholesome than before. He argues that knowing you are behaving better is not a problem; the key is to use that skill to **help others compassionately**, not to look down on them. He gives the analogy of a compassionate grandmother caring for a baby animal—this superior ability is not arrogance.

### **2. The Nature of Jhana and Practice**
*   **Jhana as a Natural Skill:** Dhammarato emphasizes that Jhana is not a special "attainment" to be coveted, but a **natural state of mind** that arises from developing skills in wholesome thinking. The Western Buddhist focus on Jhana as a goal can itself be a hindrance.
*   **The Trap of Desire:** A core teaching is that **wanting Jhana prevents Jhana**. The mental state of "when will it come?" is a state of desire and lack, which is the opposite of the satisfied, content, and joyful state of Jhana. The instruction is to relax and find contentment in the present moment.
*   **Integrating Practice into Life:** The discussion explores practicing mindfulness and cultivating wholesome thoughts in various activities—**weightlifting, stretching, walking, and running**. The key is being present with the senses (sight, sound, bodily sensation, breath) and maintaining a gladdened mind. Joy may vary based on factors like physical comfort and oxygenation.

### **3. Core Principles of the Path**
*   **Present-Moment Focus:** Enlightenment or wholesome mind is a **present-moment experience**, not a future destination. The practice is about increasing the frequency and duration of wholesome mental states "minute by minute."
*   **Skill Development:** The path is framed as developing and maintaining skills: replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, gladdening the mind, and sustaining that state through continuous application (sati, or mindfulness).
*   **Generosity and Non-Attachment:** Natural generosity arises from a mind that feels it "has enough." Speaker A notes his attachment to money diminished after deep meditative experiences, leading to more spontaneous generosity.

### **4. Critique of Commercialized Buddhism**
*   Dhammarato offers a strong critique of **Western Buddhism's commercial model**. He asserts that true Dhamma should be given freely, as it was to him. Charging money contradicts the spirit of generosity (dana) and can indicate that the teacher prioritizes money over the Dhamma. He contrasts this with the traditional alms-based, communal support system of Asian Buddhism.

### **5. Practical Instructions**
*   **Walking Meditation:** Simply being present with the sensations of walking and breathing.
*   **Sense-Based Awareness:** Keeping awareness open to the **five physical senses** is a direct way to stay in the present, "here-now" reality.
*   **The Essence of Practice:** The fundamental practice is **Anapanasati as taught by the Buddha**: gladdening the mind by removing unwholesome thoughts and cultivating wholesome ones, using the breath as an anchor.

**Overall Essence:** The talk demystifies advanced concepts like Jhana and enlightenment, presenting them as accessible, present-moment states of a gladdened mind, cultivated through continuous, skillful attitude adjustment in daily life. It warns against the pitfalls of goal-oriented desire, spiritual pride, and the commercialization of the teaching, pointing back to a simple, generous, and present-focused practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used in the talk are:

**1. The Story of the Noble and the Misunderstood Arrogance:**
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** Speaker B uses the historical examples of Jesus, Socrates, and the Buddha being persecuted or killed by people who misunderstood them. The point is that ordinary people often mistake noble, superior behavior for arrogance. A truly noble person knows their behavior is of higher quality, but this knowledge isn't arrogance—it's a fact. Pretending to be better than you are is the problem.
   * **Purpose:** To reframe the listener's fear of "spiritual ego." It distinguishes between true arrogance (pretension) and the natural recognition of one's own progress.

**2. The Grandmother and the Baby Animal:**
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** A grandmother finds a baby animal, picks it up, and cares for it because she is compassionate and capable. This is not arrogance; it's a natural expression of her superior ability and compassion.
   * **Purpose:** To concretize the previous point. True "arrogance" (in Speaker B's redefined sense) is fine—it's recognizing you are in a better position to help and then doing so gently, not rubbing it in.

**3. The Cow and Her Calf:**
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** A cow eating grass constantly keeps an eye on her calf, positioning her body to protect it. Her primary focus is the calf's safety; eating is secondary.
   * **Purpose:** To illustrate the quality of **eagerness or enthusiasm (chanda)** for the Dhamma. Just as the cow's primary concern is the calf, a noble person's primary concern is the Dhamma, with other duties being secondary.

**4. The Bus Stop:**
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** If you stand at a bus stop thinking, "When is the bus going to come?" you are in a state of lack and desire. You might even miss the bus when it arrives because you're focused on the lack rather than the present.
   * **Purpose:** To explain why striving for or craving Jhana prevents it. Jhana is a state of contentment *now*; wanting it in the future is a state of dukkha (suffering/stress) that is antithetical to Jhana.

**5. The Plateau and the Cliff (Western Misconception):**
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** Speaker B describes a common Western misunderstanding of enlightenment: that it's like living on a plateau, walking a long distance to the edge, and then jumping off into a permanent state of free-fall (enlightenment).
   * **Purpose:** To contrast this with the Buddha's teaching of moment-to-moment practice. Enlightenment isn't a distant, permanent attainment, but a quality of mind experienced in the present moment—like being in Jhana. It's about increasing the frequency and duration of these wholesome states.

**6. The Second and Third Heart (Cardiovascular Metaphor):**
   *   **Metaphor:** Speaker B explains that the leg muscles act as auxiliary "hearts" by pumping blood back up when they contract during exercise.
   * **Purpose:** To explain the physiological benefits of walking meditation and exercise, linking them to better oxygenation, which supports mental clarity and meditation.

**7. The Business Deal vs. Generosity Model:**
   *   **Metaphor/Story:** Speaker B contrasts the **capitalistic business model** (charging a set price, wanting discounts) with the **Buddhist generosity (dana) model** (freely given, based on gratitude and generosity). He argues that charging money for Dhamma teaching is a form of coercion that breaks the precept of taking only what is freely given.
   * **Purpose:** To criticize commercialized "Western Buddhism" and uphold the traditional model of dana as integral to the practice of generosity and non-attachment.

**Summary of Core Metaphorical Themes:**
*   **Nobility vs. Arrogance:** Redefining "arrogance" as a natural recognition of superior understanding that should lead to compassionate action, not conceit.
*   **Jhana as a Natural State:** Framing Jhana not as a special "attainment" but as a natural skill of gladdening the mind, accessible in the present moment.
*   **The Present Moment as the Only Arena:** Using metaphors (bus stop, plateau) to combat future-oriented desire and emphasize practice *now*.
*   **Generosity as a Natural Economy:** Contrasting the transactional business model with the circulatory, communal model of dana.
