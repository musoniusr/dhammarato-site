### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Starting the Sunday call for Wednesday UK. So yeah, we don't have Scott today, so it's going to just be a little bit more of a free-form conversation. So we were talking a little bit about kind of continuing to look and discern while we're kind of partaking in things that we find, you know, enjoyable. But so still enjoying them, but also being able to spot some some of the dangers with that as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, and I find it interesting how you mentioned the breath because it is way, way more consistent to just find enjoyment in it. And it's also kind of like a skill to, to make it enjoyable. It, it's, it's funny because it's like, at first when I was first starting, I was like, am I basically gaslighting myself into liking the breath? And I'm like, well, it doesn't matter, it's fine. Like, you know, this is one of the most wholesome things you could do is just kind of like, like breathing. It doesn't hurt nobody and it's fine and it's always there, which is just, I guess, yeah, dependable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because back with like the coffee thing, it's like, because yeah, I have found when I go out to places and I try something and then it'd be like, oh, it's not up to my standard, but I was the one who put it there anyways, the standard. So Like I've been messing with, can I enjoy coffee regardless of where it's from? Like, can I? I'm like, yeah, okay, that's a little bit more effort. Or I could also just not drink coffee when I'm out in places. But yeah, but now the breath is really like just in like learning to enjoy it has been so fruitful and so wholesome. I feel grateful. And oh man, I get all excited talking about it. So it's so weird. It's like I feel like a breath connoisseur. It's hard to talk about, I guess, like just ordinary people about like, oh, you could really learn to love your breath, which is awesome because it's like it's a part of being alive. Like, I often think like on that moment before the body decomposes and there's death, it's like you could still even enjoy the breath, which is funny. Like, like, get one last good, like, deep, thick, juicy draw in, and, and, and then like, poof. Like, I don't know, it's just, it's so awesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, it's, it's a consistent friend. What's interesting though is that, like, even with the breath, right, and so it is very helpful to, you know, when we have the opportunity to like take the long breaths that are enjoyable, you know, and are very like, you know, actually intentionally taking pleasant breaths, right? But sickness does come, right? So there can be situations where like we, you say if we have COVID or something, right, it might be a little bit more challenging to breathe, right? So in those moments, can we still find like enjoyment, right? And so that's where like, it's nice to like take the breath and it can really help to to condition the body. But even with that, there can be moments where it's like, oh, if it has to be a particular way or what have you, right? That can also lead to Dukkha in those moments, right? Actually, a couple of— was about a month ago, I was having actually like some stomach problems, but it was actually making it a little bit more challenging to like do like the long breaths and what have you. So it was just finding and being like, Okay, I can be enjoyable with this. Just being aware of the breath, you know, right now, like, is enough, right? And just also coming back to just being like, okay, it is what it is at the end of the day. So even though, like, that was definitely a little bit more of a challenging time to, like, keep a good attitude, I still came back to that. And it definitely, I would say, keeping up with the practice and what have you there was a lot less Dukkha than there would have been had I not, you know, kept with the practice and still returned. But it is an interesting thing because there is that quality. But I do think like, um, that doesn't mean that, okay, when we're not feeling that way or what have you, that it isn't very, uh, skillful to still take, you know, breaths that are enjoyable and to like get into that, you know, habit and to really enjoy those. Because that, I mean Again, to what we're working with here is like we're getting into a state where the mind can be really clear, where we can kind of see things. And so that also does help again with like the cultivation of being able to see things clearly. So like regardless, when we have the opportunity to, absolutely go for it. And then again, even just enjoying the breathing, even when it can't be, you know, because of some physical condition, right? And still kind of taking that for stock can be like helpful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure. Seasonal allergies at the peak, man, I'd be like, oh, I can't breathe right. Like, why are you messing up with my little breath toy? But yeah, I could see that in that case. It's like being attached to it, the enjoyment of something being a specific way. Is where that danger is, or being attached to it being refreshing in this way. But thank you for that, for sharing your experience, because it made that point a little bit more clear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, but that is helpful though. Yeah, like what you were saying to kind of pointing out that like it's the having to be like a very specific sort of way. And that's where I like thinking about it almost like, I mean, this is part of like the conceptualizing, right? But it's almost like we're taking a picture of something and it's like, okay, this is how we should be when we're like setting a standard. And then that standard does not necessarily align with what's going on in reality. So I think like what part of, you know, what we're practicing here with Anapanasati is kind of coming into alignment with what is actually happening in reality. Now, this doesn't mean that we can't like, you know, actually change things. You know, no, again, if we can, we can change the breath to what we can change it to and enjoy that, right? Or the thoughts around the breath of like, oh, okay, you know what, right now we can just enjoy breathing however, you know, the body is kind of going to let it, right? So there can still be kind of like effort there, I suppose, into breathing in a way that's comfortable. I think that's the main thing too. It's just, you know, breathing in a way that we can you know, that is comfortable, right? But that's going to depend on the situation, right? So it's not necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach, right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But like the comfort, it's funny because it's like, how, like aside from when we're sick, I mean, we could even find comfort in being sick and we could find comfort in the aches and pains of the body. But it's kind of interesting how like getting out of the kind of like you were saying, the snapshots of how things should be affords us a comfort that kind of was always accessible in a way, and how kind of unfriendly it is to our body or even our mind or or the feelings to kind of not go for it. You know, like, it's like, dang, like all this time I was going around beating myself up when I didn't have to. Like, what? It's very just, yeah, I guess easier. Like, it really does feel like a load just off the off the back. It's nice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. It's interesting with that because, like, you know, in a way I like to think like, okay, when we actually, like, recognize that this is the easy way, like, right effort becomes light effort. Like, it's not like— it's like, oh, wait a minute, it's actually easier to apply the right effort than to not apply the right effort. It's like easier to, you know, actually come back and look and see what's going on and make that discernment and, you know, gladden the mind than it is if we don't, right? So that's actually going, you know, because it can be sometimes like, oh my goodness, this practice is so hard and it's so difficult and all that stuff. Like those thoughts can come up, right? But it's actually when you recognize, wait a minute, no, this is the easy way as opposed to the hard way, you know. The hard way is gritting your teeth and being like, oh my gosh, this is so awful and everything is so terrible. Why am I Oh my belly, it is, you know, hurting. And then when you come back and you have those moments of wakefulness where it's like, wait a minute, it is what it is, you know, this sensation is merely just a sensation kind of doing its vibratory little thing, you know. So, you know, and that can help to, you know, ease the— well, yeah, to put an end to that dissatisfaction there. And it does make a difference. Yeah. And again, you still do, and you take care of it. You see it as a warning signal, like when there's actually actual like physical pain, right? And be like, oh, wait a minute, okay, maybe we do need to check this out and take those steps. But there's not that mental anguish that needs to, you know, follow. I'm not confessing to be like perfect at this, you know, over time or what have you, but it does— like, there's definitely a difference that that is made to like coming back as, you know, we continue to cultivate these skills. Like, definitely, and it adds to that resilience or like equanimity, if you will, of being able to ride the wave, you know. Sometimes just like things are going to be, you know, fairly, you know, easy. And then sometimes they're not easy, but we can make them a heck of a lot easier by practicing this than if we don't practice this. And like, again, if the mind is hindered and all that stuff, it actually is not actually going to be that beneficial. So yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. A fun little like reminder is like you were saying, sometimes the thought will come up that like, oh, this is a little difficult. And it's been like another, like a high, see you, Mara. Like, you know, if it ain't easy, if it ain't good, it's not the method the Buddha was talking about. So it's like, this is supposed to be good in the beginning, the middle, and the end. So if it's not that, then that's not the way, at least the way that it is talked about in the sutras. So It's fun catching that too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, that, that's it. That was right on point, Isaiah, with that, like, just like turning all of that into, again, it's good in the beginning, it's good in the middle, it's good in the end, and really coming back to that and not feeling like, okay, when those things come up, right, like, this is the trap that we can sometimes get in where it's like, oh my gosh, how did I get into this, you know? And then it continues, right? But when we can see that and we have that attitude of, aha, I see you, Mara, that attitude of congratulations, you know, there isn't like, you know, we're right back to being like, okay, cool, as opposed to still continuing with it. So I find that's like really helpful. Yeah. It's to just be like, I mean, that helps too, I find, with like practicing and really enjoying the process as opposed to trying to hit some kind of arbitrary point in our practice. Right? Like, I find this even when practicing like sitting. It's enjoyable in the beginning, middle, and end of the sit, right? If you sit down, you're like, oh, or, or however, you know, one practices in seclusion, right? And it's like, okay, we get into seclusion, and rather than being like, oh, I have to sit here for an arbitrary amount of time before it gets good, it can be like, oh, just beginning to relax the muscles, that can be good. Just beginning to take these long breaths, like the first one, it's just this breath too. I mean, that's what it's really about too, is just coming back to just this this one, right? So as opposed to like, okay, I need to be mindful for then, you know, this amount of time, and then coming back to that thought, just being like, no, wait a minute, it's just this breath, and then this one, you know, that's it, again and again. And that can be really helpful too when it's not in seclusion, like if I'm out and about at work or something, and it's been like, you know, a little bit, because like, yeah, at work, you know, things are going to come up, you know, helping customers, doing all these different things, right? This is sort of where it can be a little bit challenging to come back. But when there is that moment of Sati, you know, rather than having a remorse of being like, oh my goodness, how could I have forgotten, you know, it's like, yippee, we've remembered, we're back at it, we can, you know, enjoy this breath right now. And like, that's the attitude that I have found to be quite beneficial, you know, is to rather than slipping as soon as we get that that hit of Sati, of that wakefulness, of remembering, is not to fall into remorse, but rather to come back into congratulations, come back into this is good, come back to like, hey, you know what, we're present now. And that is what is important, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the remorse, I really feel for that one because it's like, and regardless of like where you at, where you're like, where we're at, or where what feelings or what thoughts are in the mind or that come up when the Sati comes back. At the very least, it's a moment of presence that you could spend in life. Like, some people go like 10 years and they're like, oh shit, that just flew by. Like, I wasted it all away. But the Sati gives a moment to just be like, oh, like, this is what it's like right now. And time kind of like really does become a lot more looser than the conceptual, like, line and the arrow that, that's pushing through. It's just like, well, I get to be present right now. Like, this is, this is the life right now, or this is the consciousness right now. And it's, uh, it really is like a gift.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. There's like the feeling of appreciation, of gratitude with that. And like, yeah, yeah. And yeah, with that appreciation, there can be an enjoyment, you know, there can be a delight. But the thing is, is it's not like a delight where it's like, again, it's a much more reliable, right? But even then, right, what happens is, is if we get caught in like the snapshot of the delight of being present, and then that's like the standard, right? And then that's what can happen is then there's remorse because it's like, oh, this is so good. I need to hold on to this, you know. I suppose like on one hand there can be a little bit of a skillfulness to being like, okay, let's come back, let's continue to practice and all that stuff, right? So there is a little bit of that like, okay, cool, like motivation there. But on the other hand, it can turn into a thing where it's like we're worrying about that, or like I have to be, you know, and it turns into a whole thing to try to hit that special you know, cookie or what have you, instead of being like, wait a minute, we woke up, the cookie's right here right now, or whatever it is, you know. Maybe it's an apple, you know. But anyway, the goodie is right here right now, and we don't have to go, you know, off on some long thing to go chase it, you know. It's like when we recognize, it's like, okay, it's cool, and we can come back to that presence. It's just that What I've found, right, is it's like that. I mean, that's part of the game, right? Is just like not to— or to recognize when we have kind of fallen into that sort of snapshot of it, right? It's like, oh wait, there could be something that's like way better if I only just did all these other things, right? And then being like, wait a minute, we can just drop that and come back to what's going on and be.

**Speaker B:** Like cool with that.

**Speaker A:** So like, that's kind of the thing. But it's like, it's like that's like, I mean, the thing or it'll come back up and, you know, but That's the other thing with this practice I find is like that repetition, that continuing to work it in as this becomes more of a skill and more of a wholesome habit that we develop, right? To actually wake up and take that look. And I find that's like where the— I don't know, my respect for this method really comes through. It's just like, wow, there is a thoroughness to it, to that aspect of like, in order for it to be implemented, you actually have to remember it. Like, there's like that, because thinking about a lot of different like teachings or what have you, it's like, okay, that's cool. You know, you can go in and read a long book on philosophy or what have you, and that can be cool. But where is that going to be when your car breaks down? Can you remember it? Can you have the skills to like emotionally come back and do that, right? So again, I find the Noble Eightfold Path to be very thorough. And then also it kind of— I mean, with the Four Noble Truths, I mean, I think that just coming to like an actual point of being like, okay, this is Dukkha and this is the end of Dukkha. And like, once you can kind of see the end of Dukkha, it's like, okay, like, yeah, there's not really much more else that we have to worry about. Like, not that that's even like a worry, but you know what I mean? Like, it's kind of like, yeah, sure, they can be all like the— what is it, you know, philosophical and all those. When they're Dukkha and we're satisfied, there doesn't need to be so much of a— I don't know, you're just satisfied. You're just like, okay, cool, you know? And if there are questions or what have you, It's like, that's fine, that's cool. But we're not in this sense of unease, of unhappiness. Oh my gosh, I need to figure that out or I'm not complete, right? So it comes back to a sense of completeness. It comes back to a sense of wholeness. So that's why, like, yeah, like really looking at those and coming back to that guiding compass of dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, and then having the method, you know, of the Noble Eightfold Path. To actually like do that and to do that repeatedly and to actually have like a thorough understanding of that, you know, it's a really wonderful thing. It's a— yeah, so again, really have an appreciation for the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, which is in the Four Noble Truths.

**Speaker B:** But there you go. It's great too, seeing how like the inclination towards like the snapshotting or the inclination that this has to be hard or the inclination that it has to be complicated or the inclination that there's something to figure out or something to do once you kind of get some Dukkha, Nirodha. It's so liberating to see that that's not even inherent, like that's just societal conditioning coming through that it's like, oh, well, shit, I don't got to take that personal, man. Like And it's helpful too that I've noticed I have like little, really young cousins that haven't gone to school yet. And as long as they're fed, as long as they don't have like a dirty diaper, as long as their mom's there or someone's there and they don't feel alone, then they're pretty much content. Like if you ask them, nothing's hard, you know, like there's nothing to figure out. There's just you know, just vibing. And it's like, it's cool to see that, like, oh yeah, that's not really inherent to what it is to experience life. Like, that's just the rules, the rituals, the things that you're told to do, not to do, all that. That's all that. Like, that's not a part of the process even. So it's nice to kind of remember that as well. It's just like like, yeah, like you could enjoy every step of the way. Like, you don't have to, you don't have to be all like a curmudgeon or like try, try hard, or just like, oh, like Dukkha, Nirodha. Like, it's just, it, it could be really enjoyable. And like, that's just, I don't know, it's so radical because like you said, like you could, like most people try so hard and then they finally realize they don't have to care about what other people think when they're so much in their later years or something tragic happens and they're almost forced into having to let go. And with this, you don't have to be. And it's really nice. It's just like, damn, man. Whoever figured this out, they were pretty clever, man. They were pretty smart. They were really watching what was going on. So yeah, it's good stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, that was well put. Yeah. And going to that, yeah, the rules, rites, and rituals, right? All that kind of like programming that's in there that's like, okay, you got to You know, you got to do something. You can't just sit there and be happy. You got to go have X happen, you know what I mean? And all the different standards, right, that come in. So yeah, it's really helpful to, you know, I mean, that's the thing, right? So it's— there is a bit of a process to it. At the same time, it's interesting because it's like, yeah, we do develop and we do I think over time, continue to hone the skill of being able to like actually like wake up, look at what's happening, and then, you know, make a change accordingly. So putting in the right effort. But again, it's like we arrive back home in a way, right? So we're arriving back home. And so it's like, in a way, it's like returning back to that presence. And there's a more frequency to it, I suppose, as we like practice and put in the effort. But it's not like necessarily like even like it gets better. Like it's like, okay, it's good. You know, it's like good when we're just like, oh, it's good enough right now. You know what I mean? And that's cool. And we come back to that and we return to that and again and again. There's a level where it's like, I don't know, we just, we develop those skills and we come back to that. So it's like returning home, you know, more frequently, if you will. But it's not like we're trying to arrive somewhere, you know, far off into the distance or what have you. Just like we're continuing to develop the skills of arriving back again and again. Yeah. But it's like the ability to do that, like depending on like our circumstances as well and the conditions that are around us. Right. So that's why Again, it's really like when you go into seclusion in one way, that's like easy mode, like, because it's like, okay, cool, there's not like all these different stimuli going on, you know. But then it's like if you go out into the world or what have you, or can you practice this and return home when you're at work? Can you return home? You know, that's like when, okay, the skills are, you know, there. And there'll be different degrees of, you know, success and failure. But it's helpful to come back and to acknowledge the success and to be like, yeah, you know what, Just acknowledging this current breath. I mean, because again, it's recognizing that we're setting the standards here. So when we throw up that, you know, societal baggage of like, okay, you need to achieve whatever. When we throw that out and we recognize, wait, we're setting the standards here. We don't need to climb Mount Everest. We can just recognize that we're breathing in long. And if we sat in like, okay, you know what, just breathing in long. Is just as good as climbing Mount Everest. In fact, it might even be better because we don't actually have to put in all that effort. And you actually are truthfully and sincere about that. I mean, that's a really fun way to really generate pity, is just be like, wait a minute, no, this is successful. This is really successful. And when you get back to like the whole like sort of aspect of like, wait a minute, no, like out of all the things that are worthwhile, recognizing the end of Dukkha is like actually like the top, really. It doesn't— like, that's it. You know, you can go to all these different ends and what have you, but this is really it. You know, that really works in with that feeling of success and confidence. But again, it's something that, you know, one needs to actually directly see and directly know, you know, here and now. So we start out with that little bit of faith, right, when we're first getting into the practice, but that grows and that becomes confidence when we see and we look and we see it again and again. We see it so clearly that, hey, wait a minute, we can change. We can recognize that right now we can put an end to the dissatisfaction. We can come back and become content really easily. You know, and again, that works together. So we get that feeling of success going, we get that feeling of satisfaction going. And it's like, okay, cool, you know. And then yeah, more and more as we practice, we can live our life like that. But I mean, even the ability to come back and do that when we are in seclusion and to come to that place of like satisfaction and that place of fulfillment. There are people who go their entire lives to go and climb that mountain, hit that for maybe 2 seconds, and then it's on to the next mountain. But the ability to sustain this for a particular period, like for any amount, is like remarkable. Like when, especially like when we're in it and we're directly seeing this, it's like, wow, you know, there is a wonderfulness to it. So Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And it's crazy, like, this one time I was just sitting and I was thinking, like, well, what is it, like, you know, with, like, you know, these hopes or dreams, you know, like, or these kind of aspirations, or— and I was like, what is it, like, just kind of being honest and looking at them and be like, what is it that's at the end? What's the endgame here, buddy? Like, What do you want? And it's like, oh, I just want to feel that this is good enough. Like, that's it. So it's like, I don't have to do all that. Like, that's all. It's strange because it's like, but good enough doesn't come through, like, wanting something or wanting it to be good enough. So, like, you really could only learn by doing it. Over and over again and figuring out like, oh, like, what's the right way to kind of like, like, you know, like, get back to the good enough? Because yeah, it's just like, you don't get there by wanting to for it to be good enough. You don't get there by being annoyed that it's not good enough. Like, you don't get there by just sitting and trying for it to be good enough. Like, it's just really kind of letting it kind of like like, like Dhammarato says, it's not deep, you know. It's like, yeah, it's really like right, right here in the surface. It's just like letting it kind of bubble up and, and feel that way. And it's— and then like, again, like when it gets there, then you could really just be in awe at the capacity for the body and the mind to feel really that it's good enough. Because it's not just like in the body, it's not just in the mind. It feels like very diffused and like exuberant, like, and it's just like, whoa, like, damn, this is awesome, man. I didn't have to do nothing else but just sit here and enjoy myself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. No. And again, once that, you know, is seen and, you know, those skills like, you know, come together where we do, you know, again, experience that, it's just like, wow, this really is marvelous. And yeah, I don't know, again, because it's about direct experience as well, right? I'm like, it really is the pinnacle of like sort of feeling good, right? Like in that moment when the mind is clear, like, you know, that's really it. But again, it's so helpful, I find, to reliably get into, you know, a state like that is one, the skill to be able to see past those snapshots, to see like, wait a minute, we can come back, just acknowledge this breath, just to enjoy the muscles starting to relax and all that stuff coming together and enjoying the process, right? And the steps, you know, that's when it becomes so much easier to just talk oneself into it. And again, eventually there doesn't have to be much talking. But like, it's just like, yeah, so that's really helpful. And to recognize, no, like you were saying, Isaiah, and Dhammarato brought this up, right, is the— it's not deep, right? And so I really like— again, Dhammarato is really good at like kind of figuring out stuff with language and like helping to kind of point towards things. And that's the thing, right, is because like sometimes in the practice it can be like Oh, we want to get to that super deep state of like absorption, right? I'm going to get into a super deep state and it's going to be really profound, right? But when we come back and we're like, I mean, that's not the most consistent thing, but also it might not even be the most beneficial because we're actually— what is helpful is to have that wakeful quality as well. It's like wakeful but also restful, right? So coming back to this wakeful restfulness And it's again, yeah, it's light. I mean, right, it's enlightenment. It's not enheavement. So, you know, so it is light, you know, so it doesn't have to be like this super, you know, yeah, like deep as well too. I find another thing that's helpful is that kind of getting away from, okay, it has to be. Emphasis on has to be the idea that it has to be like this laser-pointed focus, right, or concentration, you know, but rather it's open, right? It's like, okay, we're aware, we know we are breathing in, right? But it doesn't have to be necessarily like a laser-pointed focus. Now sometimes I will practice, but the difference between this is it's more of a rest. So if I do practice with like, again, the nostrils or whatever, it's more just like resting my awareness there. Or resting awareness there, but it's not like it has to be there. It's not like I have to force it here. It's just coming to a restful state, and then there's the peripheral, right? But for the most part, it's actually like, okay, when we're starting, okay, we can relax the shoulders, become aware of the whole body, become aware of the whole body of sensate experience eventually, like that sort of thing as well. The cool thing is there are so many different fun toys and things to play with and to explore, right? With like sort of delving into directly sort of studying our immediate reality, our direct experience, right? And so really coming back into that and how things are felt, you know, how does this feel? Like there's that level of exploration to it that can be quite fun. And again, it doesn't need to come from a place of craving. Right, or a place of thirsting to have all this knowledge. Actually, what's beautiful with this, and what I find with this style, what it really emphasizes, is that you don't need to know a lot, right? Like, that's the thing, is you don't need to know a lot. It's just coming on back, you know, with the breath, using that as an anchor to stay grounded in the present moment, and then to look at what's going on in the mind, to change it from unwholesome to wholesome. And then with that, the feelings come together and then we can just look and see what's happening in reality. So, but with that, right, there can still be sort of just a joyful exploration of what is happening, you know, here and now. And, you know, again, the Dhamma and enjoying that. But the problem that comes is if we go into that state and we're like sitting down and we're like, wait a minute, I need to be doing something, right? There's something I should be doing here, right? Like I have to do this or what have you. So I think it's cool to like, again, play around with some of these ideas and what have you, right? But I find it helpful to do so directly, right? Like when it comes to like ideas of Dhamma or what have you, if they are actually gliding. But when it comes to like, oh wait, no, we have to go and do this. There's something that we're not doing here that we must do, um, in that respect. When we're already satisfied, when we're already content, you know, it's like, then it's like, okay, what's next, you know? But it's like, no, we don't have to have a what's next. But that can be, that can be a little bit of a sneaky one that comes up there, right? So, but then it's coming back and being like, oh wait, no, okay, cool, I see you, you know. I think this is what's really helpful too with like not necessarily becoming, um you know, enamored with the higher jhanas is rather just being like, hey, you know what, this first sort of wholesome state, this first jhana, this is good enough. Okay, we can, we can come back here. So it becomes a little bit easier to, um, to maintain that as opposed to like, oh well, I got into this super deep state, now there's been a little bit of a hindrance, and now I'm like upset because I'm out of it. I've had to go spot the hindrance, right? So the actual aspect of spotting the hindrance, we can come back to that, can be just as joyful as like the deepest state, right? We can come back to it just like, hey, this is good, this is good too, right? And all part of the process. So that helps, I find, with like consistency there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. And letting that, that even that catching it It just makes it again much more lighter that even that is good enough. And once you're like in that just kind of free from the hindrance, wholesome state, it makes it easy to just enjoy things, but also to like play around like, wow, there's this crazy body with all of its sense doors. Like this could be like a consciousness playground. You don't need to drop acid or down some DMT, but just being in that wholesome state, you could just start messing around with how things feel. And it's awesome. It's just like, yeah, wow, I could really play around with the experience. And one thing that I found is even the perception of things are not fixed. Like, everything could just kind of like start like being all like, just like, wow, like even the way that, you know, interacting with the way things look is not even as certain. So how can the Dukkha be certain? You know, how can the how can.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker B:** Personality be fixed? Or how can these things be inherent if everything is really kind of just vibing like moving, literally, you know, like the atoms are shaking, man. Like, it's crazy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, like, there is— when the mind is clear and, you know, we can see things, it's really cool. And just to notice, like, oh, wait a minute, like, they're all just these dancing sensations. They're just like vibing out, like with the body or what have you. Like, yeah, just like, again, like, oh wow, just these like vibratory things. Like, it's really interesting, like, again, when you have your eyes closed and just sort of noticing, like, you know, okay, like the body at first feels like this very solid thing, right? But then when you really, like, from the direct experience point of view, like, how is that? Because it's not actually like In your mind, you might see like, okay, like for example, I got my hand up here. If I close my eyes, you might still see the hand, but that's not the same hand. That's like an image in the mind, not the actual thing. But when we're really kind of trapped, I suppose, or not trapped, but in that mindset of like very solid, right? The idea is that image in the mind is almost the same thing as the hand, but it's not, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It's like an image of that. And then you kind of breaking that down to like, okay, what does that really feel like? What does the hand actually really feel like? Or what do those sensations feel like? And then it's just like, you know, the actual sensations of the feeling, right? Or touch, right? But it's like more like on and off switches. Like, that's sort of an interesting thing. So it gets down to like that aspect of change on like, you know, perhaps a larger scale. Like, yeah, everything's going to fade away, we're all going to pass away someday. But then there's also like No, sensations in the body and all that stuff are constantly changing as well. The perceptions are changing. The mental impressions are changing. So there's all these different things. But the thing with it, I think, is again, it's not coming like, oh wait, this has to be something that's really hard to find. It's pretty apparent when somebody sees that in terms of change or impermanence. It's like, okay, we look and it's there. It's there, right? And it's not like, again, so much— it's not like a perception or whatever we're adding. It's just like, okay, this is the way that reality is functioning, you know? And so like, what I have found to be helpful though with kind of like looking and through continued practice to seeing that when it comes to sort of the sensual aspect of it or sensual pleasures is the fact that like, wait a minute, all these things are in such a level of flux that they're, you know, they aren't going to satisfy. You know, like there's like, it's just, you know, lastingly anyway, like it's like, yeah, nothing's going to lastingly satisfy. So what do we do? We just let it go. You know, you know, what are you left with? Well, you know, can that just be chill? Can we be chill with that?

**Speaker B:** You know, boundless joy, nothing out there will ever satisfy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, precisely. So yeah, there's a boundless quality too. Interesting enough, kind of going into that, because like what you were talking about, like how everything becomes— again, there's not so much of a solidness to it. It's very much— you can see how things are in flux there, right? And also like the borders, right, become softer. They're not— again, they— it's a really interesting thing. So there's kind of a boundlessness that we can kind of start to see again on the level of directly experiencing it, right? So yeah, because it can be helpful. I mean, it can be helpful to be— I mean, you know, object permanence has its place, right? It can be helpful if we're driving a car or something.

**Speaker B:** No, I don't want to get— I don't want an object impermanence on the freeway. Not a good idea.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so yeah, it can be helpful. But then it's also understanding like, okay, yeah, you know what, there is sort of a reason that this stuff directly, it's not gonna do it. So then it just becomes easier to let it go. And then when we let it go, it's just like, okay, we can just be chill with what is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but yeah, no, yeah, it's just like, man, can't put it any other way. It's just like.

**Speaker A:** Ah, I really like, um, I think this is kind of from the Heart Suture or some translation, but I really like going back to the phrase of kind of going beyond compare as well. Because there's a level of that is kind of helpful, I find, with like— well, again, I'm using consistency, but to like return, you know, to just kind of being chill with what is, is kind of the phrase of beyond compare, going beyond the comparisons, you know, like again, we're not judging this moment. To the last moment, right? It's just like, okay, this one is cool. So is this one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like the Sutta says, it's like giving up former liking and disliking, like just being all right, man. Like, just so good. Well, it's been a good talk. I'm gonna have to head out, but I really— yeah, I really enjoyed it. Peace out, guys.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, peace. Thanks, José. I have to go too. Okay, well, thank you for coming on. Yeah, yeah, thank you for talking. Yeah, yeah, I was gonna ask if— yeah, yeah, thanks. I was gonna ask if you wanted to add anything, but no, no, I just enjoy a little bit Dharma talk. It's nice. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Cheers.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, centers on the practice of **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** as a direct, accessible path to contentment and the end of suffering (dukkha). The conversation is a practical exploration of integrating Dhamma into daily life. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### Core Themes & Insights

1.  **Finding Enjoyment in the Breath as a Skill:** The primary practice discussed is learning to find genuine enjoyment and comfort in the breath itself. This is framed not as a chore but as a skillful means to cultivate a wholesome, joyful mind. One speaker humorously reflected on initially feeling like they were "gaslighting" themselves into liking the breath, but recognized it as a dependable, always-available source of well-being.

2.  **The Danger of "Snapshots" and Attachment:** A major point of discernment is watching out for attachment to specific outcomes or standards—called "snapshots." This applies to both the breath (e.g., needing it to be long and deep) and to life experiences (e.g., coffee needing to meet a certain standard). Suffering arises when reality doesn't match our mental picture of how it "should" be. The practice involves letting go of these rigid snapshots and finding contentment with "what is."

3.  **The "Easy Way" vs. The "Hard Way":** The speakers emphasize that the Dhamma path, correctly understood, is "the easy way." Right effort becomes light effort. It is easier to return to the breath, gladden the mind, and see clearly than it is to endure the mental anguish of resistance and complaint. As one speaker notes, the Buddha's teaching is "good in the beginning, the middle, and the end." If practice feels hard and grim, that's a sign to adjust the approach.

4.  **Celebrating Wakefulness (Sati), Not Mourning Its Loss:** A crucial attitude shift is to meet moments of mindfulness with **congratulation and gratitude**, not remorse for having been forgetful. Each moment of remembering is a gift of presence, a chance to be alive in experience. This builds a positive, reinforcing cycle in practice.

5.  **The Goal is "Good Enough" / The End of Dukkha:** The ultimate aim discussed is not a mystical, distant state but the direct realization that **this present moment is "good enough."** The practice leads to a profound sense of completeness and wholeness. The Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path provide the compass for this: seeing dukkha and its cessation here and now.

6.  **Playful Exploration in a Wholesome State:** When the mind is joyful, calm, and free from hindrances (a wholesome state akin to the first jhana), it becomes a "playground for consciousness." One can explore the impermanent, vibrating, non-solid nature of sensory experience directly. This investigative joy (dhamma vicaya) reveals the insubstantiality of suffering and fixed identity.

7.  **Consistency Over Depth, Lightness Over Heaviness:** The style advocated favors **consistent, wakeful restfulness** over chasing deep, special states of concentration. The emphasis is on "en-light-enment," not "en-heav-ement." A light, open awareness that can spot and release hindrances is valued as more sustainable and beneficial for daily life than intense but fragile absorption.

### Practical Advice Highlighted
*   **Start with the breath:** Use it as a reliable anchor to cultivate enjoyment and presence.
*   **Catch "snapshots":** Notice when you're attached to how something *should* be and let it go.
*   **Say "I see you, Mara":** Playfully acknowledge hindrances and unwholesome thoughts without fighting them, then gently return.
*   **Congratulate yourself for remembering:** Build positive reinforcement for moments of mindfulness.
*   **Find comfort in "what is":** Even in sickness or difficulty, look for the aspect of experience that can be met with acceptance.
*   **See the end of dukkha as the ultimate success:** Frame spiritual success as the contentment of this moment, not the achievement of external milestones.

In essence, the talk portrays the path as a gentle, joyful, and radically simple return to contentment by learning to enjoy the fundamental experience of being alive—breath by breath—while wisely discerning and letting go of the mental habits that create suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the conversation between Speaker A and Speaker B, here are the key metaphors and stories used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Breath as a "Consistent Friend" / "Dependable" Tool:** The breath is portrayed as a reliable, always-available companion for practice, in contrast to external pleasures like coffee.
2.  **"Breath Connoisseur":** Speaker B humorously compares developing a deep appreciation for the breath to becoming an expert or enthusiast (like a wine or coffee connoisseur), finding subtle joy in an ordinary experience.
3.  **"Gaslighting" Oneself:** Used humorously to describe the initial, deliberate effort to cultivate enjoyment of the breath, questioning if one is tricking oneself into liking it.
4.  **"Snapshot" or "Picture":** This is a central metaphor for rigid mental standards, expectations, or fixed ideas of how an experience "should" be. The practice involves letting go of these "snapshots" to align with present-moment reality.
5.  **"Right Effort Becomes Light Effort":** The practice is framed not as a heavy burden, but as the "easy way" compared to the mental struggle of resistance and dissatisfaction. It's likened to a "load off the back."
6.  **"Riding the Wave":** Represents developing equanimity to navigate life's changing conditions—both easy and challenging periods—with stability.
7.  **"I see you, Mara":** A personification and metaphor for recognizing hindrances (doubt, aversion, etc.) as temporary, impersonal obstacles, not personal failures. It's met with a congratulatory attitude for having spotted them.
8.  **"Returning Home":** The practice of mindfulness (Sati) and presence is described as a return to a familiar, comfortable, and safe state of being—a place of wholeness and completeness.
9.  **"The Cookie" or "The Goodie":** Represents the sought-after state of peace or satisfaction. The key insight is that you don't have to chase it far away; it's available "right here right now" in the present moment.
10. **"Climbing Mount Everest":** A metaphor for grandiose, external achievements. The talk contrasts this with the profound, internal success of finding contentment in a single breath, suggesting the latter is more accessible and ultimately more meaningful.
11. **"Enlightenment is not Enheavement":** A playful phrase emphasizing that the goal is lightness, wakefulness, and ease, not a heavy, forced, or profoundly "deep" state of concentration.
12. **"Consciousness Playground":** When the mind is wholesome and clear, direct experience (the body, senses, perceptions) becomes a field for joyful exploration and play, discovering impermanence and non-solidity firsthand.
13. **"Dancing Sensations" / "Vibing" / "Atoms are shaking":** Metaphors used to describe the direct, experiential insight into impermanence (Anicca) and non-self (Anatta)—that reality is a flux of vibrating, changing phenomena, not solid and fixed.
14. **"Beyond Compare":** The ideal state where one stops comparing the present moment to past moments or ideals, allowing each moment to be "good enough" as it is.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The "Last Breath" Story:** Speaker B vividly imagines the moment before death, finding humor and awe in the idea of taking "one last good, deep, thick, juicy draw in" of the breath, highlighting its fundamental role in being alive.
2.  **Speaker A's Stomach Problem:** A personal story about a time when physical illness made long, pleasant breaths difficult. It illustrates the practice of adapting—finding enjoyment in mere awareness of the breath when the ideal "snapshot" isn't possible, thus avoiding extra dukkha (suffering).
3.  **The "Remorse for Forgetting" vs. "Congratulations for Remembering":** A comparative narrative about the common experience of losing mindfulness. The talk advocates for a story shift: instead of a self-critical story of failure ("I forgot again"), adopting a celebratory story of success ("Yippee, I remembered!").
4.  **The Cousins' Contentment:** Speaker B references observing young cousins who are naturally content when basic needs are met. This story contrasts innate contentment with the "societal conditioning" and "rules, rites, and rituals" that later convince us life is hard and we must constantly achieve.
5.  **The "What's the Endgame?" Reflection:** Speaker B shares an internal dialogue where they honestly inquire into their deepest aspirations (hopes, dreams) and finds the core answer is simply to feel "this is good enough." This story underscores that the practice directly fulfills that fundamental desire.

In summary, the speakers use **metaphors of everyday tools, journeys, and playful exploration** to demystify meditation, and **personal, relatable stories** to ground the Dhamma in direct experience. The central thematic conflict is between the metaphor of the rigid, idealistic **"snapshot"** and the fluid, accepting practice of **"returning home"** to the present moment.
