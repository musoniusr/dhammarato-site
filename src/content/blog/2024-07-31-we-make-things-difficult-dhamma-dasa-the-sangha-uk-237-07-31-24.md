### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This is the Sangha call. Da da da. We are now being recorded. You guys wanna talk about Dharma stuff, go for it. And if there's silence, then I will just let there be silence, or I'll give a boring spiel. So, that is what we do. And I'm glad we waited a couple minutes at the beginning, because now maybe it gives opportunity for more people to come in. But you guys doing good? Any questions or anything on your mind concerning the Dhamma? No.

**Speaker B:** I mean, when you talk about— I'd like your take on, you know, the differentiation between caring about and caring for. And my feeling is that both sort of imply that notion that there is something fixed that cares about something else that's fixed. So the word caring, you know, when Dhammarato often says you have to stop caring, you know, I get that, and I also remember how Michael linked caring to clinging, where he said like what it really means is clinging. But just sort of the— if you do at all see a differentiation between caring for and caring about, or if it's the same thing with reference to a so-called self?

**Speaker A:** Well, does anybody else want to answer that before I give it a go? No. So the difference between caring for and caring about something, you know, it's all semantics. But I think what you're really trying to get at is best articulated in a story I can recall from Ajahn Chah, where he said one day he was walking about the the wat, and he found a kuti, somebody's little hut that was in shambles, and the roof was caving in, the doors were off its hinges, everything was broken, the rain was coming in through the roof. And he said, whose kuti is this? And then a young monk came out and said, it's mine. He's like, why is it in such disarray? Why is it in such horrible condition? He said, 'Well, you told us to let go of everything, you know, so I've just been sitting in the shade in my kuti.' He's like— and then Ajahn Chah replied to himself later, he's like, 'How could somebody be so stupid? Letting go does not mean just letting your body and everything rot away. There's a balance, you know, there's a middle way.' So whether you call it caring for, caring about, the bottom line is We all have our lots in life. Take care of whatever responsibilities is yours to take care of the best you can and live in a balanced, simple way. You don't have to overthink it, you know. That's why there is a Pali Canon. The Pali Canon is for a whole bunch of overthinkers who don't know what goodness is and don't know what it means to relax. It's simplicity. It's simple stuff. Easy. But a lot of people, they can't handle that. You know, they want complicated. That's what they were raised on with these bad habits of everything's a race to run. Everything's a mountain to climb. Everything's goddamn complicated. You could barely understand it. So there's a guy like the Buddha who talks about the Dhamma, the truth of nature, the truth of reality, and then a whole bunch of people who don't understand reality. They turn his teaching into a religion, into rites and rituals and difficulties to understand. And there you have it. Some people saw the Buddha in person and he didn't say a word to them. Like that Flower Sutta, he just handed the guy a flower and then just chilled and stayed silent. And for us, we think we're good because we have the Pali Canon. Oh, there's so much stuff to look at. But for that, for some people, they didn't know what a Pali Canon was. They just met the Buddha. And he didn't even speak to them. He just handed them a precious gift of nature and showed some Sukkha and showed some Metta and Sila and was very calm and peaceful and had a relaxed mind. But we can't grasp that, so we create things like the Pali Canon, a whole bunch of other bullshit.

**Speaker B:** And you brought up the word responsibility, you know, take care of your responsibilities. And then sometimes I find it, and you say like when it's simple and when you're being basically a good guy, then you kind of know it. But I do sometimes wonder, it's like, because there can be a, so taking responsibility for things that one's not responsible for, or vice versa, not taking responsibilities for something that one is responsible for. And sometimes it's not that easy to differentiate that either. But I guess You would say that I'm overthinking it again, perhaps.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's always easy. We make things difficult. But people say, well, maybe if I would have thought about this situation more and analyzed it, then I could have had a better outcome. At the end of the day, it's all Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. It's all impermanence. It's all dissatisfaction if you cling on to it. It's all empty. Look at all the most beautiful times in your life. How precious, how remarkable, romantic love. And where is it now? Where did it all go? That's what he means. Our minds are the only thing that sees reality. So it's Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta— not worth hanging on to.

**Speaker B:** And then if it's not too personal, You're at peace with that?

**Speaker A:** In a way, yes. It's not a matter of telling myself, am I at peace with it? Am I not at peace with it? It is what it is. I can't change anything. I can't change this wandering mind that goes ups and downs and emotions like a wild dog. I can't change it. The best I could do is to realize its nature and see it for what it is. Something that just is the way it is. It's neither good nor bad nor evil nor liking nor disliking. It's just, it's just nature. I don't take it seriously or personally. So in that regard, in that sense, yeah, I'm free from this, you know. What can harm me? I have no issues with reality. Do I want to get sick? Do I want to die? Do I want my children to be sick and die and get old? No. But what can I do? That's the way life is. The best I could do is just see reality for what it is. That's Pañña, wisdom, you know.

**Speaker B:** Very true.

**Speaker A:** Ignorance wants it to last forever. Ignorance wants it to be different than the way it is. This is true ignorance. Ignorance is wanting things we don't have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that is definitely thought terminating, I would say.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thoughts are natural. Like Dhammarato has been saying recently, Dukkha will always come. But it's baby Dukkha, you know, it's baby weeds in our garden. We've already done the work, we've already gardened. Now we just sit back and when the weed pops up, we just remember to take a look and change it and pluck it out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's working for me anyway.

**Speaker A:** That's very good.

**Speaker B:** Especially in conjunction with the breath, the weeding. I mean, you know, when you're talking about the weeding, you're going to take the weed out. I think the breath is an amazing ally with that. It could even be the scythe that one uses to cut the weed off, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the breath is the doorway to what is. It's just this right here, right now. It's just this. All the thoughts, all the Dukkha, everything is the Dhamma. Can we be okay with that is the question, and that's what the breath reminds us. It's the doorway to right now, away from our wandering attachments.

**Speaker B:** What a gift.

**Speaker A:** Yes, indeed. So does anybody else have any questions, comments, concerns, anything on your mind? Come on now, don't be shy. Very good. Then we're all enlightened Masters, okay? Well, it was good talking with you all, and I'm gonna have to make this call a bit shorter than my other ones. But much Peace and Love, and thank you for joining. Thank you. Thank you all. Bye. I love you all. Goodbye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and teachings discussed:

**Core Topic: The Nature of "Caring" and Letting Go**
The central question was about the difference between "caring for" and "caring about," and how this relates to the instruction to "stop caring" (as a synonym for stopping clinging/craving). The main speaker (A) clarified that this teaching is not about neglecting one's duties or becoming passive.

**Key Teachings and Points:**

1.  **The Middle Way in Action:** The speaker used an Ajahn Chah story to illustrate that "letting go" does not mean abandoning responsibility or letting your life and surroundings fall into disrepair. The path is about balance—taking care of your responsibilities in a simple, balanced way without overcomplicating things or creating stress.

2.  **Simplicity vs. Overcomplication:** The Dhamma is presented as essentially simple—being a good person, relaxing, and seeing reality clearly. The complex Pali Canon is described as a tool for "overthinkers" who struggle with this simplicity. The highest teaching is sometimes just a peaceful, silent presence (like the Buddha handing someone a flower), which embodies *sukkha* (happiness), *metta* (loving-kindness), and *sila* (virtue).

3.  **The Ultimate Reality Check:** The core of the practice is repeatedly seeing the true nature of reality: **Anicca** (impermanence), **Dukkha** (unsatisfactoriness/stress), and **Anatta** (not-self). All experiences—even the most beautiful—are impermanent and not worth clinging to. Wisdom (*pañña*) is accepting "what is" without wanting it to be different.

4.  **Freedom Through Non-Identification:** Peace is found not by forcefully changing the mind's wild nature, but by **not taking it personally**. By observing thoughts and emotions as natural, impersonal events, one becomes free from being harmed by them. "I have no issues with reality," the speaker stated.

5.  **Practical Tools:**
    *   **The Breath:** Emphasized as the essential "doorway to the present." It's the anchor that brings you back from wandering thoughts and attachments ("the scythe" to cut weeds).
    *   **"Weeding" the Mind:** Dukkha (like weeds) will always arise. The practice is to consistently notice it and "pluck it out" by changing your relationship to it, not by fighting it.

**Overall Tone and Conclusion:**
The talk encouraged a relaxed, non-striving application of the Dhamma. The goal is to be "okay with what is," using the breath to stay present, fulfilling responsibilities with balance, and seeing all phenomena—pleasant and unpleasant—as just the Dhamma, the truth of nature, unfolding.

The call ended with an affirmation that this simple approach is working for the participants and a note of gratitude and communal well-wishing.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A) uses the following metaphors and stories:

**Metaphors:**
1.  **The Garden & Weeds:** This is the most developed metaphor. Dukkha (suffering/stress) is compared to weeds in a garden. The practice is the gardening work. After doing the initial work, one simply watches for "baby weeds" (small, arising dukkha) and "plucks them out" or cuts them off with a "scythe" (mindful attention/breath).
2.  **The Breath as a Tool/Doorway:** The breath is described as:
    *   An **"amazing ally"** in the weeding process.
    *   A **"scythe"** used to cut the weeds off.
    *   The **"doorway to what is"** or **"the doorway to right now,"** which leads away from wandering thoughts and attachments.
3.  **The Mind as a Wild Dog:** The untrained, wandering mind with its ups, downs, and emotions is compared to a "wild dog."
4.  **Overcomplication as a Race/Mountain:** The tendency to overthink and complicate the Dhamma is metaphorically described as seeing everything as "a race to run" or "a mountain to climb."
5.  **Thought-Terminating:** A concept (the recognition of impermanence) is described as **"thought terminating,"** which itself is a metaphorical phrase meaning it ends circular thinking.

**Stories:**
1.  **Ajahn Chah and the Dilapidated Kuti (Hut):** This story illustrates the misunderstanding of "letting go." A monk, hearing he should let go of everything, lets his physical living space fall into complete disrepair. Ajahn Chah uses this to teach that letting go is not neglect or indifference to one's responsibilities and well-being, but about a **balanced, simple "middle way."** This story directly addresses the question about "caring for" vs. "caring about."
2.  **The Buddha's Flower Sermon (Referenced):** The speaker references the famous story (often called the Flower Sermon) where the Buddha, instead of giving a verbal discourse, simply held up a flower. The point made is that the deepest teaching is in silent, embodied presence (Sukkha, Metta, Sila—happiness, loving-kindness, virtue), not necessarily in vast scriptures. The speaker contrasts this with modern over-reliance on complex texts like the Pali Canon, which he humorously calls "a whole bunch of other bullshit" created for those who "can't grasp" the simple, direct truth.

**Core Conceptual Metaphors:**
Underpinning the talk are several common Buddhist conceptual metaphors:
*   **THE DHAMMA IS A PATH/GUIDE:** Implied in the discussion of practice and simplicity.
*   **CLINGING/ATTACHMENT IS A BURDEN:** The idea of "letting go" to be free.
*   **WISDOM IS SEEING/ILLUMINATION:** Pañña (wisdom) is described as "see[ing] reality for what it is."
*   **IGNORANCE IS WANTING/CRAVING:** Defined as "wanting things we don't have" and "wanting it to be different than the way it is."

In summary, the speaker uses the **Ajahn Chah hut story** to teach balance and the **garden/weed metaphor** to describe the ongoing practice of addressing dukkha, with the **breath** serving as the primary tool. The **Flower Sermon reference** supports his critique of over-intellectualizing the Dhamma.
