### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Think about all of the ways that the Dhamma, the Sangha bring beauty and happiness into our life. And we gladden the mind in this way, you know, when we come into these things, we collect these characteristics of First Jhana. And when we open our eyes and we just don't— whoop, the boundary is gone, the border is gone between formal and informal practice. We can walk around, have such a great day, have so many wonderful experiences. And, you know, and like we talked about last time with recollection of the Buddha, with the virtues of the Buddha, we buh, doh. And after we get real used to it, just like we open our eyes in first Jhana, if we drop buh and doh, if we drop sustained thought, we drop applied thought, directed thought, we're in second Jhana. Man, we're doing great. The wheels are really turning. And, you know, as we come back to that moment over and over. Maybe if we were sitting around— there's a scientist man, Donald Hoffman, Professor Donald Hoffman talks about interface theory of perception, okay, where he says much of what we see is not what is really there, it's what we've evolved to see over time because it's been beneficial to us, you know, it enhances our evolutionary fitness to be able to pass on the life in this way to see these things. But we know that We don't step in front of a train because we see it's a train. Okay, it doesn't matter what it really is. We know if we step in front of the train and we stand in front of it, we're going to have a problem. So when we abide in first Jhana, there's a lot less problems. When we abide in second Jhana, less problems. Third Jhana, fourth Jhana, maybe at this point we're deconstructing the interface a little bit. It might be a little harder at times to move around in the world in this way. But it doesn't mean it's not a beautifully beneficial practice because in doing so, in deconstructing experience, or we could say disassociating experience, like if we talk in the way of maybe we drop Piti, you know, we have this blissful feeling, Piti, ooh, all over the body, so wonderful, we cultivate it. And then when we drop it, we're not just dropping one aspect of experience, we're also integrating with a larger aspect of experience. It's a more integrated experience of the field as it is, the field of experience, you know. So when we can remember to come back to those moments, we remember to come back to our breath, we remember to come back to the virtuous aspects of the Buddha, or any number of things. Like I said earlier, we are discovering what is already there in the mind, you know. We start with coming out of the womb, and we have this wonderful mind. It's perfect, it's pristine, but it's not incorruptible. Because as we know, you know, through early childhood experiences and everything else from then onward until we discover the Dhamma, most especially this beautiful Dharma, Sangha, the Triple Gem, the Buddha, we have the ability to allow the kilesas, the defilements, they can come up. And as they do, the most wonderful thing of it, like we talk about, you know, no Mara, no Buddha, as the kilesas as they come up, well, then we can chance into opportunities at which we can get rid of the kilesas, we can come back to what was already there. And it's one of the beautiful aspects of Buddhism in general is, you know, in the West, we presuppose that we have these damages, that they have irreparably changed us in some way or something like this, whereas when we listen to the teachings of the Buddha, most especially the supramundane teachings of the Buddha-Dharma that we share with each other here in our Sangha, we know we're not fixing anything. We're discovering what's always been there. And, you know, I still laugh at times when I recall sitting in a call with DJ and Dhammarato and Dhammarato asking us, he says, DJ, are there any alligators here? It was honestly— it strikes me every time I find myself having kilesas come up, I think, Alex, are there any alligators here? Remember what your friends asked you. And it's such a glorious moment to be able to reflect on.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and shared among Sangha friends, centers on integrating formal meditation (Jhana) into daily life and understanding the Buddhist path as one of rediscovering innate purity rather than fixing a broken self.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. Seamless Integration of Practice:** The talk begins by emphasizing how the beauty and happiness from Dhamma and Sangha should gladden the mind. The goal is to dissolve the boundary between formal sitting practice and informal daily life. By cultivating the qualities of the **First Jhana** (joy, pleasure, and directed thought), one can carry that stable, happy awareness throughout the day.

**2. Progressing Through Jhana Naturally:** The speaker describes a natural progression in meditation: becoming so accustomed to the focus (e.g., on the breath or the Buddha's virtues) that the initial effort ("applied thought") falls away, leading to the deeper calm and unification of **Second Jhana**. This process of letting go continues through higher Jhanas.

**3. Deconstructing Perception for Benefit:** Referencing Donald Hoffman's "interface theory of perception," the talk notes that our everyday perception is a useful evolutionary construct, not ultimate reality. As one moves into deeper Jhanas (**Third** and **Fourth**), this conventional "interface" is deconstructed or disassembled. While this might make conventional interaction trickier, it is profoundly beneficial because it leads to a more **integrated and direct experience of reality** as it is.

**4. Rediscovering Innate Purity, Not Fixing Damage:** A core theme is the contrast with Western psychology's common assumption of permanent damage from past trauma. The Buddha's teaching frames the mind as originally **pristine and perfect**, though "corruptible" by defilements (*kilesas*). The path is not about repairing irreparable damage but **discovering what has always been there**—the innate, undefiled mind. Defilements are not tragedies but **opportunities** to practice and return to that innate purity.

**5. Using Pithy Teachings as Tools:** The talk concludes with a personal anecdote about Dhammarato's teaching style, using the humorous and memorable question, **"Are there any alligators here?"** This serves as a tool for mindfulness—a quick reminder during moments of arising defilements to check in, see the lack of real danger (no "alligators"), and let the unwholesome state go.

**In essence:** The talk guides practitioners to blend deep meditative absorption with daily life, using the Jhanas as a framework to deconstruct deluded perception and return to the mind's original, undefiled nature. It frames the entire spiritual path as a joyful homecoming rather than a arduous repair job.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about meditation (Jhana), perception, and Buddhist practice:

**1. The Boundary/Border Metaphor:**  
The speaker describes the transition from formal meditation to daily life by saying, *"the boundary is gone, the border is gone between formal and informal practice."* This uses the metaphor of a geographical or political border to represent the perceived separation between structured sitting meditation and mindfulness in everyday activity.

**2. The "Wheels Turning" Metaphor:**  
When describing progress in meditation, they say, *"The wheels are really turning."* This is a common metaphor for things operating smoothly, efficiently, and with momentum, like a well-oiled machine or vehicle.

**3. The "Interface Theory of Perception" Analogy (Story of Donald Hoffman):**  
The speaker references cognitive scientist **Donald Hoffman's "interface theory of perception."** This isn't a traditional story but a scientific analogy used to explain how our everyday perception is not reality "as it is," but a simplified, useful interface—like a computer desktop icon representing a complex file. The speaker extends this by suggesting that deepening meditation (Jhana) is like **"deconstructing the interface,"** allowing one to perceive reality more directly, even if it makes conventional navigation in the world *"a little harder."*

**4. The Field of Experience Metaphor:**  
The speaker refers to *"the field as it is, the field of experience."* This metaphor portrays conscious experience as an open area or landscape that one can become more integrated with, suggesting unity and spaciousness.

**5. The "Pristine Mind from the Womb" Metaphor:**  
A central narrative metaphor compares the mind at birth to something *"perfect, it's pristine,"* but *"not incorruptible."* This story frames the spiritual journey not as fixing a broken self, but as **clearing away corruptions (kilesas)** to rediscover an original, inherent purity. This directly contrasts with a Western psychological story of permanent damage.

**6. The "No Mara, No Buddha" Paradox/Story:**  
The phrase *"no Mara, no Buddha"* references a classic Buddhist paradoxical idea. Mara represents temptation, obstruction, and defilement; Buddha represents awakening. The story here is that the very appearance of defilements (**kilesas**) creates the opportunity to overcome them and discover awakening. Defilements are not separate from the path but the very material for it.

**7. The "Are there any alligators here?" Anecdote/Story:**  
The speaker shares a personal, humorous story from a teaching session with **DJ and Dhammarato**. The question *"Are there any alligators here?"* is a metaphorical inquiry about immediate dangers or defilements. The speaker internalized this as a reflective tool: when *kilesas* arise, they ask themselves, *"Alex, are there any alligators here?"* This story turns a simple, quirky question into a practical metaphor for mindful checking and recollection of teachings.

---

**In summary, the speaker uses:**

*   **Spatial Metaphors:** Borders, fields, wheels turning.
*   **Technological/Scientific Analogies:** Deconstructing a perceptual interface.
*   **Nature Metaphors:** Alligators (as dangers/defilements).
*   **Contrasting Narratives:** The Western story of irreparable damage vs. the Buddhist story of rediscovering innate purity.
*   **Personal Anecdotes:** The story of the "alligators" question from his teachers.
*   **Traditional Buddhist Frameworks:** The progressive Jhanas as a journey, and the paradoxical story of "No Mara, No Buddha."

These devices help make abstract meditation states and philosophical concepts more relatable, concrete, and memorable.
