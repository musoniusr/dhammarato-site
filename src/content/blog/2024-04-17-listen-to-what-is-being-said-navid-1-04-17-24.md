### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Navid, you were asking a question, something about why are so many Buddhist, especially highly revered ones, so what you call cold. Can you expand upon that a bit?

**Speaker B:** I mean, just on the videos, they appear cold. I just don't see a smile on their face, and they never seem to speak about happiness as you do. At first, you just came up with it. Like, that was one of the most important things. But also, as an experience, I met a monk once because I got my degree late in life, and I went to college, and I saw this guy, and I kept wanting to talk to him, and he absolutely did not want to have anything to do with me or anybody else. But he was just there. He was always going to the library, coming out. I would always cross paths with him. I would always say hi to him. He would never even— like, after a while, he realized I was there. From the corner of his eyes, so he would kind of avoid me. And, you know, I don't know what his life was. I mean, he was doing his own thing, but it just kind of reinforced the coldness of it. And I thought, well, maybe I'm just not looking at these guys, you know, maybe they're happy, but they're not showing it the way I'm expecting.

**Speaker A:** Let me explain it to you in this way. There is a duality in the human, and that duality is expressed in many different ways. You've heard yin and yang.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Anima and animus. Dry and wet. Hard and soft. But I like, in fact, that's the way that I use it, is the hard and the soft. We can also misunderstand it to be masculine and feminine, to where almost all of the females are hard, not soft. In fact, the only time that women are soft is when they're having a baby, when they bond with that infant. But by the time the kid's 3 or 4 years old, mom's back being hard. Pick up your toys and do what you're told to do. Okay, so our culture raises us hard. You got to get up in the morning, you got to work to eat, you got to do what you're told to do. Okay, now when one goes on a spiritual journey, they bring that along with them, and so they now follow a new set of rules. And one of the set of rules that they have is equanimity, or aloofness, not involved with the world, not engaged in the world, and they do that in a really hard way, because that's their training. OK? Not having a smile. But that's not the way of what the Buddha taught. In fact, the teaching of the Buddha is trying to get people to move out of the hard into the soft. That in fact, even in India, they talk about it in the sense that there are two paths: the hard path and the soft path. Now, the hard path is the development of certain kinds of skills that are actually needed in the soft path, and that many people who are too soft or soft too early they don't develop the skills that they need, so they wind up being ineffective and they still stay a loser. Because we have to move out of being a loser in our mind state into being a winner. Or another way of talking about it is coming from a victim, or instead of a bottom dog, we have to go through the phase of being a top dog. Before we come to the third phase of no battle. There's no— you're not a top dog, you're not a bottom dog, that you're even higher than the top dog because you don't even bother fighting with the top dogs. Okay, so this is what I mean by a real winner, and you've heard this before in the sense of quiet strength. That people who are really, really strong don't bother to prove how strong they are. It's only the weaklings who are trying to prove how strong they are. Okay, so a bully is actually still mentally a victim.

**Speaker B:** Right? Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we are born victims. You can't move your hands correctly, you can't walk around, you can't even walk, never mind ride a horse and shoot bows and shoot arrows at high speed, at a great distance, and hit the target. You can't do that when you're a baby. We start off as an infant, we start off helpless, and we gain over the years, we gain that mentality of being helpless. And we wind up being then helpless around adults. They're big people. Their furniture is too big for us. We have to hold Mommy's hand when we cross the street. And then a couple of years later, we wind up being, you got to go to school, you got to learn your ABCs, pick up your toys, clean your room. And so we remain in that state of victimhood, and we stay in that state of victimhood all throughout life. Even the elderly remain victims. That's why you find so many old people in churches and synagogues and places of worship, is because they are still victims of some god.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, that's very interesting. I've never heard this before. You're the first one who had told me. I mean, I've heard this from you from another video, but I was— I had never heard this before. That's amazing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nobody grows up. Now, in some cultures in the old days, there was something called a rite of passage. All right. And that rite of passage in the very, very early days was when the little boy no longer was a gatherer staying with his mommy and the other kids and the other women, but he went out hunting with the big boys. This happened at about the age of 6. For some reason, the age of 6 had been an important age throughout history. Okay, that in fact, 6-year-olds are often used in India as waiters. I have been in one restaurant where the old man was asleep and didn't get bothered, and everybody else who worked in that restaurant was under the age of 7.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And they ran the place. They cooked the food, they delivered the grocery, or they delivered the food on the table. They wiped the table, they cleaned the table, they did the dishes. Collected the money, they did 100% of the work as a 6-year-old. Now, I'm not in favor of child labor, but what I'm saying is that at that age, we're capable of doing a lot of stuff if we were allowed to do it. But instead, we got to go by the plan we are told to do. And so that whole idea of a rite of passage— now let me give you two examples of that. One of them is, and then I know most about the Tuscarora Reservation and the Indians on the Tuscarora because I spent quite a lot of time there, but I was born in Oklahoma and I have Native American blood. Okay, so this is part of my own past, and so I know quite a lot about this. And then some of the tribes would take a young buck at various ages. It wasn't always that he had to be 17. In fact, they didn't have calendars and they didn't count. But when a guy was ready to do it, they would send him out into the wilderness with nothing but a few things like a knife, maybe a bow and an arrow, and he had to stay out there for at least a full moon. 30 days. If he came back early, he was a complete failure. He was a girl. If he didn't come back, it's because he got killed, and well, that happens. All right, but if he can make it on his own for 30 days, that's a rite of passage. He grew up because he was on his own. All right, another example of that— it's been watered down over time, but that was all the idea of the bar mitzvah in the Jewish system, right, where the kid had to learn how to be a man, and then they had a ceremony to congratulate him and to put him as a man. And they're typically done about the age of 12.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, and how about in Africa too?

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And the guys who go through it can grow up to be a man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they were. I always thought I should go through something like this because the, you know, I grew up in Rwanda and they had those three tribes and they had the genocide and all that. But the one tribe I knew, they always had that rite of passage. And those are the guys who took the country over. They were so disciplined. You know, because of this, I mean, that's the only thing I can think of is what made him so strong. I don't know exactly at what age they would go through that, but they would go through a time where for 2 days or longer, adults would spit at this child and insult him, and he would just have to sit on a seat, on a chair, and just take the abuse, take the abuse for 2 days non-stop, and then that was it. He would— and I would see the difference, uh, you know, like, this is a totally different person now. It really showed that something happened, and I didn't know what it was, but now I see that it's that rite of passage, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we have now substitute rites of passage. I would go so far as to say that that was— it's a substitute, it's not a real rite of passage. That a real rite of passage takes more than 30 days. And yet the adults, they don't want to put the guy through that because they don't have to go— want to go through it either. Yeah. So the substitutes that we have is like getting married, graduating from college, and going to the military. And the military is pretty hard on them, but it's all done in a sense of camaraderie, to where what we're talking about here is the rite of passage of someone is on his own. There is no way of trusting his fellows because he's got no fellows. He's out on his own. Okay, this is also kind of the way that monks are trained in Thailand, and this is part of the reason why in the Tibetan system, they will send somebody up into the mountains for 3 years, is to put him on his own. Oh, okay. So that he's got to buck up, he's got to take responsibility for himself, because otherwise he's going to be dead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But our cultures normally fail the young men, and so they wind up being even graduating as old, but we still have that hard system. In other words, everybody's got to keep proving themselves and proving themselves because they never quite believe it. They never quite grow up completely. All right, they become bullies. I mean, almost all of the police in the United States were the high school bullies.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And they just continue to bully people. Why do they bully them? Is because they are afraid that other people are going to be in control. But if he was really in control of his own life, then he wouldn't mind other people being in control at all. Okay, this is the whole point. So in this hard method Because this is back to the question that you were asking. In the hard method, everyone thinks that I've got to get it right. I've got to follow all the rules. Okay, some will become scholars, some will become translators, some will follow every rule that they can find and make up rules. These are actually— can be considered austerities. Or things that are beyond the pale. And the Buddha actually only allowed a few austerities. He didn't— he wasn't in for them because in his life he was going through the hard method. There's a lot of different stories about that. So there is a hard method, and when the guys go through it They probably never go all the way to the end of it. They somehow get stuck in the middle of it, and they continue to be hard until maybe they finally give up. And when they give up, they've got two things going now. One is that they've got all the skills that they developed when they were hard. And number two Now that they've given up, they can become soft again. So now they're true winners.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. And that doesn't happen very often.

**Speaker A:** That does not happen very often. But in fact, that's one of the stories, or one of the primary stories about the Buddha, because he was the very best. He almost starved himself to death. He was very good at these austerities. He was also very good at the meditation practices that he was taught and recognized that both of these are extremes. Where is the middle path? And that's when he sat down and figured out how the mind works.

**Speaker B:** Because we— just to back up a little bit, I'm sorry, and I'm totally following you. Thank you for explaining this. I just wanted to know, during the time of the Buddha, what did people used meditation for? Because they were using it as part.

**Speaker A:** Of their— Look at modern India today to answer that question. The same, the same thing that they're doing now, they did 2,500 years ago. I've even in Hyderabad saw naked wandering ascetics, and one of them was a dog duty ascetic. What does that mean? It means that he doesn't eat food off of a plate unless the plate's on the ground.

**Speaker B:** Oh, like the.

**Speaker A:** Anagami around on all fours, acts like a dog, pisses and defecates in public, goes around naked.

**Speaker B:** I heard of these people.

**Speaker A:** That's pretty hard, isn't it? I've also seen photos of— not photos, but videos of people who are climbing a mountain by the following method: that while they're standing, then they lay down a full body's length, come up on their knees, get up again, and then stand up and then lay down again. So it's about half of a human body length every time that they stand up and lay back down on the ground. And they do that in prostrations all the way up the mountain. Very, very hard stuff. Yeah, okay. There, um, an example that's kind of interesting is, is that both the Zen and some, uh, Westerners who are in Thailand want to eat their food very fast, you know, just gobble, gobble, gobble, don't pay any attention to it. To where that was not what the Buddha taught. The Buddha taught to be slow, to reflect, to watch what's going on in your mouth and don't take another bite until after you have completely cleaned out your mouth, not even a grain of rice left. And then you take the next bite, which means that it may take you an hour to where ordinarily it'd take 10 minutes to eat, right? But these high-speed guys, they want to do it in a minute. In fact, it's almost a competition that they— the student has to finish before the teacher finishes. Okay, you can see the hardness in this. I've got to get it done. I've got to get enlightened. Yes, some skills in doing this. In fact, this is what, uh, the— in the West, the Mahasi Method does. These guys will get really intense in their meditation. This is why they wind up in fear, misery, anguish, despair, that is often referred to wrongly as a dark night of the soul.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And the soft method has none of that. The soft method is just give up, just keep giving up, stop doing the hard way. And so some of the most famous monks were the ones who were doing it hard. Their whole life story is about doing it hard. But when they're an old man, they finally give up. And that's when they're highly revered. And so then the Westerners will say, oh, this guy is so highly revered, he's given up. Let me know what he did. Well, he did for years wrong. The same thing was with the Buddha. So he's a clear example of do what the Buddha says to do, not what the Buddha did, because the Buddha was on the wrong path. Up until the last minute, and then he changed from the hard to the soft. Okay, so what you're calling cold is the guys who are practicing hard, they're trying to get all the rules, they even make up new rules to follow.

**Speaker B:** Rather than— I'm sorry, can you say that one more time? I missed a little bit of the Like about 30 seconds ago, your voice dropped.

**Speaker A:** Right, you mentioned the word cold, and I'm talking about it in the sense of hard. And one can go for the hard for a long time until they recognize that that's wrong. But most people will not admit that what they're doing is wrong. They don't finally give up. This is why it's good to study the story of Eckhart Tolle. He's one of the one of the very, very few people on the planet Earth who was so unhappy and so miserable and worked so hard that he just gave up and spent about 2 years doing nothing, sitting on a park bench in London on the Thames.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's a fascinating story.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this also happened with Achan Mun, and yet so many people want to study the book about Achan Mun's life And it's a story of struggle, striving. And the Buddha didn't teach to strive. He talked about it in the sense of persisting, to keep coming back to easygoing, keep coming back to everything is OK, have no problems, no worries. In other words, we become the champion through training the mind rather than training it through the skills of riding horses, jumping from high places, defeating enemies, memorizing scriptures, and doing all of that stuff the hard way. The soft way is to just quit and continue. Just remember to just quit.

**Speaker B:** You have to keep telling us that because we keep we keep missing the post. I mean, we— let's just talk about me, you know, like the mind just takes you somewhere. What is it that makes it so.

**Speaker A:** Hard to keep it? Okay, because we were taught wrongly over and over and over and over and over again. Because our parents were critical of us, we've learned to be critical of us. And so a lot of the stuff that we have is self- criticism. We're critical. This is why the people go the hard method, is because they're trying to get over the criticism rather than stopping the criticism. And so the real teaching of the Buddha is to stop criticizing, not match up to the goals of the criticism.

**Speaker B:** So you must have gone through the same thing yourself, right? Did you go through all the hard.

**Speaker A:** Stuff and finally— Oh, I've been all over the place. I've been there, done that.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But sometime along the line, we have to give up the struggle and recognize that I've been wrong. I've been struggling when I didn't need to struggle. Been trying to prove myself when I'm already okay. I don't have to prove that I'm okay. I'm already okay. And so this is the real teaching of the Buddha. That's the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Just come out of the Dukkha because you stop flagellating yourself, you stop criticizing yourself, you accept yourself the way you are, warts and all. That in fact, often we lie to ourselves because we know what the rules are, and when we break the rules, we deny it. You say, oh no, I didn't do that. Oh no, I'm not angry. When in fact we're angry, but we're not supposed to be angry. We've broken our own rule, and so we lie to ourselves.

**Speaker B:** So it's better to just be angry at that moment and let it break?

**Speaker A:** No, it's better to know that if you're angry, because if you are angry and you know it, you can do something about it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, yeah, great.

**Speaker A:** You can say, wow, I was angry, I can take a rest.

**Speaker B:** That's amazing. It's so beautiful. It's so— it's mind-boggling how wonderful this is and how nobody talks about it. You know, you could spend your whole life on YouTube and only a few videos will teach you this, you know. Mm-hmm. So when I read the readings of the, uh, some of the scriptures from the Buddha, I should look for that. I mean, because sometimes maybe because the translation and all that is so, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, our language is— here's the thing though, the ones who do the translation are the ones who were doing it the hard way. And so their translations appear, even when the Buddha is talking about it in the soft way, the easy way, people will hear it through their own filtering system.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we all do.

**Speaker A:** And so the translations winds up being, this is very hard. And so people put the Buddha way up there.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Because he, he did such a struggle. He was so good at the hard method without recognizing that he gave that up.

**Speaker B:** But it's so clear that he gave it up, but we don't pay attention to it. But we— it's just like, yeah, we don't really think about what does it mean to give up all these things.

**Speaker A:** If you really understand the story, then you can do something about it. Okay, there's actually another story, a story actually of failure rather than of success, but it's really telling, and that's the story of Adam and Eve. Now, the story of Adam and Eve has a lot of plots and twists. They've got talking snakes. And then in fact, I've even heard that the snake not just talked to Eve, he seduced her. And that the point is, is that it's not a fruit, it's not an apple. The fruit that's been translated as fruit is actually better understood to be the results So they ate of the fruit of knowledge, which means they had to put up with the fruit of their knowledge of good and evil. And seeing good and seeing evil is the hard method, the judgment. And so they were in the paradise, which was just a paradise. That's all it was. It was just a marvelous little garden. It was a paradise. But they started judging that paradise as good and evil, and they destroyed the paradise out of their own judgments. It's like somebody can give somebody a wonderful gift, but it's judged, oh, it's the wrong color, it's the wrong size, it's the wrong shape, it's the wrong year. It's the wrong this, that, and the other thing, and this marvelous gift now has become trash because of the judgments, rather than accepting things the way that they actually are. It wasn't good enough. So we spend our whole lives in that hard system going around trying to make things better because nothing's good enough. We judge it, we judge the paradise, and we judge ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we judge everything constantly.

**Speaker A:** Judge constantly, judging about what's good and what's bad. Now here's something that's very, very interesting, is that the Buddha doesn't talk about it like that. He talks about Vedana, which means feelings, and that we can feel either wisely, see how we feel. Like for instance, if you're angry, you know you're angry, you can do something about it. If you're ignorantly angry, that means that you refuse to believe that you're angry, and you'll even hurt somebody trying to prove that you're not angry to them.

**Speaker B:** Right? I totally get it. Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. So this is the second noble truth, really, is that we are angry— or excuse me, we are ignorant, we're stupid, we're deluded even. In a state of denial about the way that we feel. And yet, if we like something, then we ignorantly want it. Like, I see the girl, I want her. I see the car, I want it. I see the house, I want it. And we go around ignorantly wanting things, or ignorantly wanting to get rid of things. And wanting to get things and wanting to get rid of things is exactly the same thing. In the sense of if I want the car, then what I want is really to get rid of the feeling I have about I'm not good enough because I don't have the car. And when I get the car, for a little while I'll feel good enough, but then that feeling of not good enough will come back ignorantly. Okay, so wanting goes to grasping and clinging, but it also has another quality to it, is that if I like it and I want it and I need it and I have to have it, it must be good. And if I don't like it, I don't want it, and I want to get rid of it, it must be evil. And so this is where judgments come from, based upon our ignorant feelings rather than wise feelings. But if we are knowledgeable of our feelings and wise to how we feel, we can do something about it. We can change the way we feel. In fact, there's a very famous statement made by Ajahn Samatha in a particular ceremony. I won't go into the detail, but Ajahn Chah asked him, "Do you like her, or do you like these girls that are all dolled up in this ceremony?" morning, and, and, uh, uh, Arhat Samatha gave a very interesting answer: I like it, but I don't want it. Can you be wise enough to see that you like something, never mind why? It's in our DNA, it's in our habits, and it's in our, uh, way that we were raised. For instance, uh, when a child is raised, the best food for the rest of his life is going to be his own mama's cooking because he got used to it when he was a little kid. And this is why people, when they travel, uh, like to Mexico, they'll get Montezuma's Revenge because the food doesn't agree with them. Actually, they don't agree with the food. Right. So this, we get into these habits that determine what we like and we don't like. Rather than doing the liking and not liking wisely, we make it into a habit.

**Speaker B:** So to do it wisely, you have to really pay attention when you're making that decision.

**Speaker A:** You have to pay attention to how you made the decision. You have to pay attention all along. Of how you got there.

**Speaker B:** How you got there.

**Speaker A:** How you got there. Okay. And so this is the teaching of the Buddha in the form of what is referred to as Paticcasamuppada, or dependent origination, that our feelings occur because of what we made up. Not reality. For instance, if we see a girl walking down the street, how she's dressed and what makeup and a whole lot of other things determine whether I like her or not based upon all of my old stored information.

**Speaker B:** All the preferences you got over the years, the things you decided were good versus bad.

**Speaker A:** An example of that is when in 1860 The young boy, the 15 or 16-year-old boy, gets all excited because he saw a girl's ankle. That's all he got. Okay, well, you can see how that works in with burkas. Burkas, in fact, don't help to hide anything because it's all in the boy's imagination anyway, that in fact women would probably be less there would be less rape, there would be less harassment, that women would be more equal if every human being ran around naked. You could really see what she was as she is, rather than what you're making up by mentally taking her clothes off, right? All right, so you gotta live in Living in reality is what this is all about. Now, people who are doing the hard method are making up a reality that things are hard, where in fact things are really easy when we stop working at it. Reality is very easy, but we make it hard. We create the hardness. And when we give up, that means that we give up the effort We give up the work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And allow things to be as they are. Easy peasy. Everything's okay. Not a problem, not a worry in the world. But we make up our problems. We make up our worries. We were taught to do that. We were taught in our society to see everything is broken and needs to be fixed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Everything is judged.

**Speaker B:** Everything. Yeah. And so when we worry about, especially like procrastination, we worry so much. I do. I worry so much about certain things until I finally do it.

**Speaker A:** So you've done it 10,000 times by thinking about it. You keep doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it and are dissatisfied. And then you actually do it physically and you become relieved completely?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now it's possible for you to have not done it all of that time until you finally did it, but you didn't think about doing it. Procrastination is putting off something you've got on your mind, but if you never give it a thought and then you do it, then it's easy. Why? Because all of that time it was hard because we had it on our mind, I've got to do it.

**Speaker B:** So whenever— so is that one of the signs? Is as soon as you see that something gets hard, you got to pause and see where your mind is?

**Speaker A:** In fact, start looking at words like hard and try. And not good enough, those kind of words, so that we can see that that's how our mind is working. So that you can actually stop using the word, then in fact that's actually a good— oh, how to say it— to start looking at the words we use and start changing the words we use will help us to learn to change the mind. Let me give you an example of that. In some cultures, they will have a party for a pregnant girl. It's called a baby shower. She hasn't gotten her— have you ever heard of the term baby shower?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I have two kids, so three kids, so.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So that, that's when they shower the girl with gifts that are to do with the baby so that she'll be able to take care of the baby and be a good mother to the baby. But we don't ever have a shower for a 6-year-old. We only have it for a new infant. OK, so one of the traditions in some cultures in this baby shower, they play a game. And the game is that all the women are chatting and talking about all kinds of various things associated with the baby. But it is the the rule of the game. You cannot say the word baby. You have to avoid that word in this baby shower. All right. And if some woman does get off and talking and then she forgets what she's saying and she uses the word baby, everybody's listening. Aha, we caught you! Okay. And it's a great big game and everybody's having fun. And this was pointed out to me, and then I began to understand we should have a whole long list of words that we're going to avoid, that we don't use these words anymore. And if we can put words on our don't say this word list, like try, because trying means that you're a failure generally. And when a psychologist says to somebody, offers them a piece of advice, and asks them— the therapist will ask them, 'Are you going to do it?' And they'll say, 'Well, I'll try.' That's a guarantee that they're going to fail, but they don't want to say, 'I will not do it,' or 'I'll fail at it.' They'll say, 'I'll try.' That's a lie. So be careful about the word 'Uh, try,' because it's almost always an excuse for failure in the name of success. 'I'll try it,' when in fact you're not trying it. It's not a real trial, it's not a real education or an event or a, um, a skill development. It's the attitude of failing at it. All right, using the word hard— be careful about how you use the word hard. Now, I've been using the word hard only in the sense of how people work hard, but in my own mind, nothing is hard. It's all easy. It may take time to do it. If I'm unwise, then that's hard. Wisdom, everything is easy. Stupidity makes it hard. For instance, breaking into somebody's house is because you don't have the— you're ignorant of the key, so it's hard to break into some houses. But if you got a key, if you know how to open the door, it's easy.

**Speaker B:** So this feeling that you're saying, or the word hard, And then it's immediately preceded, but comes after. What comes after that is that feeling that you can't do it. Because for me, sometimes I don't even know the words.

**Speaker A:** We fail and say this is hard. When we fail, instead of learning the lesson and then doing it correctly, we'll say it's hard because we don't like to fail. And so we say it's hard when in fact it's not hard. We just don't know how.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** That's right. So there's another word that we could put on this short list, and that is the word sorry. When we apologize to somebody, we can say the word sorry. But why should I be sorry? Let us say that I bumped somebody or I stepped on their toe or I offended them in some way. Or maybe a video got cut off, or somebody calls and I don't answer. And so when I get back with them, the common thing that people would do would be say, I'm sorry, I wasn't available. Now, am I sorry, or is that a lie? Do I actually feel sorry when I say sorry? And is there better ways of making up for it? Can just say, I wasn't available. Why do I have to say sorry I wasn't available?

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Or missed your call, not sorry I missed your call. Now here's where that comes from. It comes from wanting to avoid punishment. Because punishment is designed to make the kid feel bad, to feel sorry for what he's done. So we say sorry in advance, that takes the power away from the punisher because he's already gotten what he was intending to do, was to make you sorry. That in fact, in Thai language, they have a similar word that they would use for sorry. It actually translates in many of the dictionaries But the word is in fact kutut, and what the word actually means— tut is a but, and ko in this regard means do it, kick me in the butt, beat my ass.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is how we mean sorry. Means I'm trying to avoid you kicking me in the ass, so I'd say I'm sorry. So, we don't have to be sorry, we could just explain. We could say, "I apologize," but don't say the word "sorry" unless you actually mean it. Is there real sorrow? It's possible that I would miss a call and feel real sorrow because I didn't talk to the guy that I wanted to talk to, and now I don't see him for a long time. And so the sorrow lingers and continues until I catch it and say, aha, I'm not sorry that I missed that call. I missed that call yesterday. Why am I sorry today? It's because I remember it and then I feel sorry. All right. Now, if we really want to go for it, one of the items we can put on that list is the words of I, me, and mine. So that we avoid saying things like, "Listen to me," and just say, "Listen." And the only time that we use "I," "me," and "mine" is to make sure that they understand that in fact, in Thai language, the "I," "me," and "mine" is almost never used. Used. Here's an example: is, uh, uh, paitiao means to go out. So in English we'd say, are you going out? And in Thai they will just say paitiao because we know who's going out. All right. Or paitiao means I'm going out. But if I'm preparing to go out, then I say paitiao I don't have to say I'm going out. And so in Thai language, they don't use pronouns very much unless it's absolutely needed in order to clarify. And yet English language is one of the most common words— I, me, you, they, etc. Like that. So can you learn— when I say can you, is it possible to not use those words by being careful of the language that's being used.

**Speaker B:** And by using those words, it's— what does that do? Like, it affects your ego?

**Speaker A:** It opens your mind about what ego that is there.

**Speaker B:** 'Cause I really use that word a lot, so.

**Speaker A:** Many people do, mindlessly. And remember that we're now training the mind around certain words. Don't use that word. Or when you do use it, know that you've used it.

**Speaker B:** Know that you use it, yes.

**Speaker A:** Like for instance, I've done that twice in the last sentence, and when I say I've done it twice, I hear that. Listen to what is being said, because if you can listen to what's being said, then you can also begin to see and hear what the thoughts are behind it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I believe that. So how do you listen? You're there completely, 100%, listening to the.

**Speaker A:** Words that are used, rather than I'm listening to the words I use. Just listening to the words being used and take the I, me, and mine out of it. Take the use out of it.

**Speaker B:** You know, when you were mentioning, you know, some other Sangha about your own pile of shit, we're usually not aware of how much shit our pile has because sometimes.

**Speaker A:** This will help to see what crap there is.

**Speaker B:** Now, are there some that are so obvious that those who are not Buddhist have no idea about that you can tell us about? Um, because I feel like sometimes, you know, ever since I've been listening to your talks, I see that, you know, sometimes you said you were happy to be on top of our pile of shit. And we don't even want to— like, we're happy to be unhappy, basically. And so what is it that— like, how deep— when I listen to some of your other one-on-ones, I can kind of see it in the other person where they're completely oblivious. And so I'm sure I have that, but how do you break that? How do you become aware of— practice. It's just practice.

**Speaker A:** Over and over and over again to practice listening to the thoughts, practice knowing how you feel, practice looking, practice listening. Develop the skill of listening, develop the skill of looking. Because the automatic system is going to go the hard way, making Dukkha, rather than the soft way. And so waking up to the language we use, waking up to the vocabulary that we choose over and over and over again, to where it becomes subconscious, unconscious. So making that language conscious, listening to the words that are being used.

**Speaker B:** And so that's basically where meditation's at. I mean, that's every moment.

**Speaker A:** You see, many people have the idea that meditation has a lot of special stuff to it, like a special time, a special place, a meditation hall, a cushion, an altar, particular incense, or maybe a pair of smelly socks, a photo of a guru, or a Buddha rupa, or a candelabra, or an altar. All of this kind of stuff is what people have in their mind of meditation— outside things. They even have the idea of a squatting posture, but the Buddha talked about all four postures: sitting, standing, walking, and lying down. Whatever posture you're in, remember to look at the language that you're either saying with your mouth or concocting in the mind. Every moment you have the opportunity, every moment everybody has the opportunity to listen to what they're thinking, because our thoughts is what makes us feel. And we're in the habit of thinking about doing something You mentioned procrastination.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So what is procrastination? Is nothing but thinking about doing something and not doing it. Yeah, putting it off. Well, putting it off means that we're thinking about doing it and then we don't do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. But the Buddha would say it's okay to put it off, but put off thinking about it too. Don't grind the mind about doing it and then not do it. Either do it or don't do it, but don't grind on. So the example would be going to the bank. Gotta go to the bank. And so we're going to go to the bank next week, but we plan and we think about the bank, and we— I gotta go to the bank, and all of those thoughts about going to the bank, and we're not going to the bank. We may not even be procrastinating because we got a particular schedule. We've got an appointment. So if you got an appointment, why think about the appointment until it's time for the appointment? Don't miss the appointment, but don't think about it in advance, working ourselves up.

**Speaker B:** I tried this, you know, lately, and it works so well, but it's like I'm so used to my old ways of thinking that I'm in disbelief that it's actually working.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's just a thought. Can you say, aha, I see that part too?

**Speaker B:** Right now I can, now that you mentioned it. I mean, now that you made me aware of this, now I realize that's a step that I just.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let me give you a story about that. There was at one time when I was teaching at a university, and I had made an appointment with someone, a girlfriend, that I would be at her house at, say, 2 o'clock in the afternoon after school. And then I hung around the school and doing this, that, farting around, doing this, that, and the other thing. And so I was hours late. And when I arrived on the way there, I was all planned up for how I'm— what excuses I'm going to use and getting ready for a fight with her and all of that kind of stuff. And then when I got to her house, she was glad to see me. She didn't remember that we had an appointment. It didn't matter to her. And I was ready for a fight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When in fact there was nothing to it. And that was awakening.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't know what other people have on their minds, so just leave them alone. Stop having to, you know, work ourselves up into preparing for something that might not happen.

**Speaker B:** I'm doing this with some relatives because my father just died in the end of December, and it was in Belgium. So I went there, and now I'm procrastinating calling my cousins because of all the thoughts I have in my head about what am I supposed to say. Or who cares? I should just call, you know. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Don'T worry about it. Don't worry, don't worry, be happy. If they called you, oh, I'm glad to see you. Or if you call them, oh, I'm glad to talk with you. Yeah, but you're worried instead.

**Speaker B:** That's so true.

**Speaker A:** And that's because you've got a rule somewhere that you're supposed to call them. So see that rule. Who made that rule up that you're supposed to call them?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And that's how you break it down.

**Speaker A:** You made up that rule.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Or I accepted it wherever it came from, and I just made it my own.

**Speaker A:** You learned that rule from somewhere else, maybe when somebody years ago died and your family then was all uptight about calling all of the family members around. In the really old days, we'd have to get in our horse and buggy and go all the way across the county to tell somebody that their sister died. And now we're procrastinating giving them a telephone call.

**Speaker B:** Isn't life crazy? I mean, well, like he said, our lives are so great. Even if you just look at the history, you know, we lived such great lives now. But we don't see any of that.

**Speaker A:** And we destroy our paradise by judging it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna go back to one thing you said, because I have a Native American boy that I've adopted, love him completely. He's 6 right now. And since you mentioned the age of 6, I'm thinking, you know, Is there some things that I should do? Yes, that would be good to do.

**Speaker A:** Play with him. Let him do what he wants to do. Join him in what he's doing rather than you think you've got to teach him how to do it. Okay, the example of that would be if you want him to clean his room, instead of telling him to clean his room because Daddy wants it clean, not the boy. What you can do is get a big bag, a grocery bag or something, and say, let's play basketball. You can wad up your clothes and throw them in the basket, and I'll hold the basket to see if I can make you miss the basket.

**Speaker B:** I see. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so make everything a pleasure, everything a game for the 6-year-old. Allow him to enjoy his life.

**Speaker B:** Fantastic. Yes, I totally see that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because 6-year-old, that's the time when we tell them you got to go to school. Yeah, so you can ask him, do you like going to school? Foster him wanting to go to school. If he wants to go to school and likes going to school then he will get good value out of it. That in fact, there are some, let us say, stories about some kids are really brilliant, like young Sheldon. And there's one, what do they call it, The Big Bang Theory, where you've got a couple of guys who were going to college when they were 11. It's not that they're brilliant and that they're smart, it's that they like to learn. And most kids are taught to hate school, to hate learning.

**Speaker B:** Yes, well, I'm lucky.

**Speaker A:** So those kids that are considered prodigies is only because they like what they're doing. The same thing is true with with people like Mozart. You know that Mozart traveled with his dad, took him to every court and every kingdom all over Europe before he was 10 years old. Why was that? It's because when he was 3 years old, he liked to play the piano, he liked to compose, he liked what he was doing because his parents were good musicians. And they showed him, and he liked what they were doing, so he liked to do it. So make sure that your 6-year-old likes what he's doing, he'll become brilliant at it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I believe that. Good one.

**Speaker A:** And if he doesn't like what he's told to do, he won't be good at it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the truth.

**Speaker A:** So when he's got homework, do the homework with him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no, that's exactly what I've—.

**Speaker A:** Make, make it fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the make fun part, yes, that's.

**Speaker A:** Really big for him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Uh-oh, my daughter's coming in. What do you Meet Dhammarato. Oh, say hi, Dhammarato. Hey! That's my daughter. I was having— You need to go bathroom? Yes. Okay, I am so sorry. Okay, I'll come.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's go ahead and finish this call. You can call me again.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I've enjoyed our conversation.

**Speaker B:** It's been a real, real pleasure. Thank you, and I will follow as much of it. But the practice— is there a book that I should read just for a little Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** I recommend the book called Naved. It's well between your ears.

**Speaker B:** You got it. You're the best, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Sangha friends including Navid (Speaker B), explores a central theme: **the difference between a "hard" and a "soft" path in spiritual practice, and how the Buddha's true teaching points toward the soft path of ease, acceptance, and happiness.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Question & Observation**
*   Navid begins by asking why many revered Buddhists/monks appear "cold," unsmiling, and don't speak about happiness. He shares a personal anecdote about a monk who seemed aloof and avoidant.

### **Dhammarato's Framework: The Hard Path vs. The Soft Path**
Dhammarato explains this "coldness" through a duality:
1.  **The Hard Path:** Characterized by strict rules, striving, austerity, judgment, and self-criticism. It's a mindset of "never good enough," where one tries to *prove* themselves through discipline, equanimity (misunderstood as aloofness), and struggle. This is the path of the "top dog" or the bully, which is ultimately rooted in an underlying feeling of being a "victim" or "bottom dog."
2.  **The Soft Path:** Characterized by ease, acceptance, giving up struggle, and stopping self-criticism. It's the path of realizing "I'm already okay." This leads to being a "real winner"—someone with quiet strength who doesn't need to prove anything.

### **Key Insights from the Talk**

*   **Cultural Conditioning:** We are raised in a "hard" culture that emphasizes rules, work, and criticism. This conditioning is brought into spiritual practice.
*   **The Rite of Passage:** Modern society lacks true rites of passage (e.g., surviving alone in the wilderness) that help individuals transition from victimhood/helplessness to genuine, self-reliant adulthood. Substitutes (college, military) often lack the crucial element of solitary responsibility.
*   **The Buddha's Journey as the Model:** The Buddha himself first mastered the hard path of extreme asceticism, then **gave it up** to discover the Middle Way—the soft path. The lesson is: **do what the Buddha *taught* (the soft way), not what he *did* initially (the hard way).**
*   **The Danger of the Hard Path:** Practitioners stuck in the hard method can become rigid, judgmental, and experience "dark night of the soul" phases of misery. They translate the Dhamma through a filter of striving.
*   **The Essence of the Soft Path (The Real Dhamma):**
    *   **Stop Criticizing:** The core practice is to stop self-flagellation and accept yourself "warts and all."
    *   **Awareness of Feeling (Vedana):** Be **wisely** aware of your feelings (e.g., "I am angry"). This allows you to address them. **Ignorant** feeling is denial or being driven by unconscious likes/dislikes.
    *   **Give Up the Struggle:** The mantra is "give up, just keep giving up." Move from "trying" to "doing" or "not doing," but without mental grinding.
    *   **Judgment Destroys Paradise:** Like the story of Adam and Eve, our constant judgment of good/evil ruins the inherent "paradise" of the present moment.

### **Practical Advice & Tools**
*   **Mind Your Language:** Become acutely aware of words that reinforce the hard mindset. Create a "don't say" list:
    *   **Try:** Often an excuse for anticipated failure.
    *   **Hard:** Usually means "I don't know how," not that the task is inherently difficult.
    *   **Sorry:** Often an automatic plea to avoid punishment rather than genuine sorrow.
    *   **I, Me, Mine:** Overuse reinforces ego. Practice speaking without unnecessary pronouns.
*   **Meditation is Moment-to-Moment:** It's not limited to a cushion. It's the continuous practice of listening to your own thoughts and language in all postures.
*   **Example with Procrastination:** Procrastination is the *thinking about* a task without doing it. The solution is to either do it or not do it, but **stop the mental commentary** about it. Don't live in the imagined future conflict.
*   **Parenting Advice (for a 6-year-old):** Make everything a game and a pleasure. Foster *liking* what he does. Join him in his world instead of imposing rules. This cultivates natural brilliance and joy in learning.

### **Conclusion**
The talk reframes the Dhamma as a path to happiness through softening, not hardening. The "cold" demeanor Navid observed is a symptom of being stuck in the striving, rule-based, hard phase of practice. The true goal is to develop the skills of the hard path (like discipline) but then to **give up the struggle** and transition to the soft path of wise awareness, self-acceptance, and ease, thereby ending self-created suffering (*dukkha*).

**Ultimate Message:** The Buddha's enlightenment was about discovering that the way out of suffering is not more struggle, but **giving up the struggle.** Our paradise is here now; we destroy it with our judgments and self-criticism. The practice is to watch our minds, soften our language, and learn to "not worry, be happy."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain his core teaching about the "hard" vs. "soft" path in spiritual practice and life. Here's a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Hard vs. Soft:** This is the central, organizing metaphor.
    *   **Hard Path:** Characterized by rules, striving, austerity, self-criticism, judgment, and proving oneself. It leads to a "cold," aloof demeanor (like the monks Navid observed).
    *   **Soft Path:** Characterized by ease, acceptance, giving up struggle, non-judgment, and "quiet strength." It leads to genuine happiness and equanimity.

2.  **Top Dog / Bottom Dog / No Battle:** A metaphor for psychological development.
    *   **Bottom Dog:** The victim mentality we are born with and culturally reinforced.
    *   **Top Dog:** The phase of striving to be a "winner," which often manifests as bullying or proving oneself (but is still rooted in a victim mindset).
    *   **No Battle:** The highest stage, where one transcends the struggle entirely. A "real winner" doesn't need to fight or prove anything.

3.  **Paradise and Judgment (The Story of Adam and Eve):** Used to explain how we create our own suffering.
    *   The **Garden of Eden** represents a state of natural paradise or ease.
    *   **Eating the "Fruit of Knowledge of Good and Evil"** is reinterpreted as the act of judgment—labeling things as good/bad, right/wrong. This judgmental mindset destroys our innate "paradise."

4.  **Pile of Shit:** A blunt metaphor for the accumulated mental habits, criticisms, and negative thought patterns we carry. The practice is about becoming aware that we are sitting on top of this pile.

5.  **Key and Lock:** Used to explain difficulty vs. ease.
    *   **Stupidity/Ignorance** is like trying to break down a door—it's **hard**.
    *   **Wisdom** is like having the key—it makes everything **easy**.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha's Journey:** The primary example of transitioning from the hard to the soft path.
    *   **Story:** The Buddha excelled at extreme austerities (the hard path) but nearly died. He realized this was an extreme, "gave up," and found the "Middle Way" (the soft path). The moral: "Do what the Buddha says to do, not what the Buddha did" before his enlightenment.

2.  **Rites of Passage:** Used to illustrate how modern culture fails to help people (especially young men) mature out of the "victim" mindset.
    *   **Native American Example:** A young man sent into the wilderness alone for 30 days to prove self-reliance.
    *   **African Example (from Navid):** A ritual where a child endures verbal abuse for days to build discipline.
    *   **Modern Substitutes:** The speaker critiques modern substitutes like graduation, marriage, or military service as inadequate because they lack the element of *solitary* responsibility.

3.  **Eckhart Tolle's Story:** Referenced as a modern example of someone who "gave up" the hard struggle (after intense misery) and moved into the soft, accepting state by sitting on a park bench for years.

4.  **Ajahn Mun's Story:** Mentioned as a revered monk whose biography is full of struggle (the hard path), but whose reverence came from the softness of his later years after he "gave up."

5.  **The Professor's Personal Story:** He shares an anecdote about being late to meet a girlfriend, mentally preparing for a fight, and discovering she had forgotten the appointment. This story highlights how we create "hard" scenarios in our minds that have no basis in reality.

6.  **The Baby Shower Game:** Used as an analogy for mindfulness practice. Just as players avoid saying the word "baby," we can practice avoiding certain words ("try," "hard," "sorry," "I/me/mine") to reveal and train our subconscious habits.

7.  **Mozart / Child Prodigies:** The story of Mozart traveling as a child is used to emphasize that brilliance comes from *liking* and *enjoying* an activity, not from forced, "hard" training. This is applied to advice on parenting a 6-year-old.

### **Linguistic Metaphors (Words as Tools/Weapons)**

The speaker places great emphasis on the words we use, treating them as indicators of our mental state:
*   **"Try":** A metaphor for anticipated failure.
*   **"Hard":** A metaphor for self-created difficulty or ignorance.
*   **"Sorry":** A metaphor for pre-empting punishment, not genuine remorse.
*   **"I," "me," "mine":** Metaphors for ego and self-centered thinking. He contrasts this with the Thai language, where pronouns are often omitted, suggesting a less ego-centric reality.

### **Overall Narrative**
The talk weaves these metaphors and stories into a larger **narrative**: We are born into and trained in a "hard" system of judgment, rules, and self-criticism (the "hard path"). Spiritual practice often mistakenly continues in this mode, leading to coldness and struggle. True happiness and enlightenment come from the "soft path"—**giving up the struggle, accepting reality as it is, and abandoning the judgmental mindset that destroys our innate peace**. The stories of the Buddha, Tolle, and others serve as maps for this fundamental shift from hard to soft.
