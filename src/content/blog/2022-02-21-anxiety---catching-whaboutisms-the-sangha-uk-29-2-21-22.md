### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Done. Okay, um, welcome to the Sunday Sangha. Glad to see you guys. Uh, we've already been discussing a bit about, uh, practice and what it's useful for. And, um, Carl, I especially want to say welcome to you, and Ron, you're also an old friend, and that we had started to talk, Carl, about your not getting anything out of the meditation, and so you stopped doing it. And then at another time, you recognized that right now, during this work time that I'm feeling the anxiety, now is when I need the meditation. Okay, both of those are actually excellent insights, because in fact what you were practicing in meditation was not anything that would get rid of anxiety in this moment, that in fact the inspection of anxiety does not allay anxiety. And that often anxiety comes when we have thoughts about what if, referred to as what-if-ism. Now there's two kinds of what-if-isms. One kind of what-if-ism is, or what-about-ism, would be when you're accused of doing something wrong. And the answer to that would be, well, what about what he did? Because it's wrong too. And because he did wrong, I can do wrong, or maybe he did worse and didn't get punished, so I shouldn't be punished. So that's one kind of whataboutism, and that is the whataboutism of the psychopath. It's the whataboutisms of the politicians and those who are trying to get away with doing wrong deeds. But the other kind of what-if-ism is the kind that almost everyone else has, including that. I mean, if you do get flamed or you might do the what-if-ism, but if you are just sitting in okay and then you start worrying, well, what about if this happens? Or what about that happens? Or maybe I've got to get this done, or maybe I've got to get that done. And then we don't recognize that that's the source of the anxiety, is when we play these what-about-isms. Games in our own mind. And that they also, these whataboutisms, lead to doubt, doubt and worry and frustrations and all of that kind of stuff. And then piling on, it becomes anxiety and stress. And so there's several ways of working with this, and one has— and actually, the ways of working of it has to do with how quick we You can catch it.

**Speaker B:** Did you observe the pattern happening in real time?

**Speaker A:** Right. So how slow are we in real time to catch it? Are you going to be all the way into a full-blown anxiety attack before you recognize, oh, I am behaving recklessly right now because I'm in a full-blown attack? Or We can have it when there is a little bit of anxiety, or in meditation we can see anxiety as it arises. And then eventually we can be able to see the actual thoughts that help that stuff arise, to come up, what's the triggers for it. And then beyond that, there is, based upon our, let us say, underlying attitude And when that begins to change, then our attitudes change. And when our attitudes change, the kind of thoughts we have change. And the kind of thoughts that we have change then don't create the anxiety. So that's kind of the sequence of events that would happen over a long period of time. But really what we're talking about is the teachings of the Buddha. And the teachings of the Buddha is normally referred to as Paticcasamuppada, or the way that the mind works. Oh, there you are. Now you're back. Your camera keeps cutting in and out.

**Speaker C:** Somebody was trying to call me, so that's why.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see. All right. So Basically, the practice has to do with the Mahasi Method in particular, has a particular piece that's missing. And that's the piece that's missing about that stage in their practice before they— Hello, hello, hello. Okay, this is Carl, and we're giving him a basic introduction to to the practice that he's already been doing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, nice to meet you, Cal. And are you Ron? Yeah, nice to meet you, Ron. I'm Marcus.

**Speaker C:** Nice to meet you too.

**Speaker A:** Marcus, your microphone is quite noisy. Oh, okay, okay. All right, so, uh, yes, lots of, uh, air noise. And I would think that a big fancy expensive microphone like that wouldn't have a lot of wind and air noise.

**Speaker B:** So I had to turn the gain right up because the preamp is so small.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you've got a preamp running. That's why you've got such high volume. Yes, I got it. Okay, so getting back to what we were speaking on, the Mahasi Method looks at what's going on and keeps noting and keeps seeing what's going on. And the students will say, well, what do I look for? And the student and the teacher will say, well, you just look at what's going on, right? That's the normal way that they start it. All right. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching of the Buddha is the Four Noble Truths, most specifically Dukkha, Anicca, Nirodha, which means to see the problem, to see the anxiety, to see the worries, to see whatever it is that's in the mind right now. And then change it from unwholesome to wholesome immediately, to do it right then and there. That's the real teaching of the Buddha. And that this teaching is actually seen in the suttas in many cases referred to as the hindrances, that the first thing we have to do is remove the hindrances. Have you ever heard that?

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, how do we remove the hindrances? The way that we remove the hindrances is by putting in a new thought. To not let those hindrances put us into a state of anxiety. We're going to have the kind of thoughts that are going to put us in a state of peace and relaxation. Does that make sense?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, actually, since I've been actually been noting and then putting in a positive thought, the negative thoughts actually stopped coming back as often as they would before. And it only took me like 2 days or 3 days of this practice because I already was so good at noting things. That I didn't need to focus on noting so much. I just needed it to replace the noting with something else as well, like add an extra layer to it.

**Speaker A:** That's that added ingredient that's right there on the Eightfold Noble Path, the right effort. And what is one's right effort? To remove unwholesome thoughts and to replace them with wholesome thoughts. Remove the thoughts that lead to Dukkha, to remove the thoughts that have to do with danger. And those thoughts of what-ifs are actually looking at all the things that could go wrong. And when we're looking at all the things that could go wrong in the mind, in the mind they are going wrong. And that's the source of the fear. Oh no, I'm creating danger and thinking about dangerous things, and so I feel danger. That's quite remarkable, isn't it? Do we actually talk ourselves into anxiety? Which means now that we can talk ourselves out of it. In fact, a better way of saying it even is that you've been spending your whole life talking yourself into feeling bad. Now it's time to start talking yourself into feeling good. That's the change, and that needs to be practiced. But really, what is being practiced is to remember to look and to change, to remember to look and to change over and over and over again, to remember to look and to change. These three items are actually on the Eightfold Noble Path. Sati is to remember, Right view is actually not a viewpoint, it's a viewing. So wake up and look at what's going on and then make a change. All right, have you ever heard the expression wake up and smell the coffee?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, what are you going to do immediately after you smell the coffee?

**Speaker C:** Take a sip.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. All right. Now, that whole statement of wake up and smell the coffee is actually a specific way of stating Anapanasati as a practice. To wake up, smell, which means to take an inhale, to take a deep breath, and to be in your sensory awareness, in this case, the odor. And then a moment later into taste. But these are waking up and being in sensual awareness. And so this is much of the practice, in fact, is that let's get out of our heads and get into our sensory awareness, the eyes, the ears, the touch, that which we use to know that we're in the here and now. The senses that are experiencing what is being sensually experienced right here, right now. And when we're thinking about over there, back then, or way off into the future, then that's just merely conceptualizations in mind, not real. Okay, now, way back when, in very, very primitive times, Little animals, all of them, every animal that exists that we know of, even down to the cellular level, has an instinct built in, the self-preservation instinct. That even a tick, if you pull it off the dog and you have it in your hand, on your finger, it will try to run away and hide. Okay, if mosquitoes or geckos. We got geckos on the wall, and if you put your hands next to the gecko within 5 or 6 inches and then start moving it, that gecko will see your hand and then he'll run away. That is the fear response that every animal has. But animals do that fear response based upon something that comes in from their sensory awareness. A big hand that's bigger than the— that kind of thing. Or maybe a lion is chasing us, something like this. But as humans have evolved into the kind of thought systems and also the civilization that we've created, then in fact you can imagine that the jungles way back in ancient history were really dangerous, that humanity was always in a sense of danger, that there were many animals that were bigger than us. And so in fact, we needed tools to protect ourselves, that if it is just me and the lion, then I'm meat, I'm lunch. But it's me, the spear, and the lion. Now we've got a possibility of survival. Right. And so basically that tool set winds up being the village and then the city. And we have always used that instinct, but we've used also the higher part of the mind to find ways of getting out of the fear. But we haven't really dealt directly with the fear. In other words, humans have found a way to live a life that's relatively secure and not dangerous. And yet all of that mechanism of fear is still in operation, except that now we become afraid of things that are not dangerous at all. An example of that would be a letter comes in the mail that's the electric bill, and we open it up and it's gigantic. We don't like that. And so we put it on the table. And now every time we walk by that envelope and see that envelope, we feel afraid. Why? It's just an envelope. It's not going to hurt you. Isn't that amazing that we become afraid of an envelope sitting on a table? Or maybe the envelope triggers a fear, and then all kinds of thoughts will come about it. And so what's necessary is for us to use these three things to remember to look at what we're doing. And then make a change to come out of those kinds of thoughts that have been very, let us say, well-worn, well-used habit forms. Things are just piled upon pile upon pile and for a while we just pile things on. In fact, everybody's got a PhD in Dukkha, just piled higher and deeper.

**Speaker C:** Would you say addictions fall into that place as far as like, for some reason addictions seem to me like they're much deeper behavioral patterns or is it thought generated as well, like the thought generates the addiction?

**Speaker A:** Actually, we can look at an addiction as basically the mistake of saying, if you don't succeed, try, try again. Or, uh, it's been attributed to Einstein, but Einstein says he didn't say it. And that is, is that insanity— the definition of insanity— insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a new result, right? And that's exactly what we do. So people go into the Mahasi Method, keep doing the same thing that they've been doing before, only now they're doing it intensely. And they're not getting any new results. We just go into meditation and just think about all the thoughts that we've been having all along rather than making the change. That in fact, that quality of change is something that needs to be looked at. For one thing, one of the primary teachings of the Buddha is the teaching of Anicca. You probably heard that: Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. What that means is that everything is in turmoil, everything is in flux. Another way of looking at it is, is that there are basic cycles and things go in cycles. But at any one point in that cycle, if the person doesn't recognize the cycle that they're in, then when they're in the south part of the cycle, they don't like it when it starts to move west. But if you stand back and just recognize, oh, there's a north, south, east, west, there's a north, south, east, west, and it goes into a circle, and that eventually even what north is changes, like the North Star— not the same North Star that we had centuries ago— but everything is in changing, but everything goes in giant circles. And when we can't see these giant circles, when we're caught in the loop That means that we don't like it when it moves from this to that to this to that without recognizing that everything is in cycle. So, uh, one of the expressions that I use to help students see this is the expression of sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Give yourself credit for being able to see the cycle rather than hating being caught in the cycle. That's another attitude change, is to just be in that cycle and recognize that you're in a cycle. And sometimes you feel up, sometimes you feel down, and sometimes you feel good and sometimes you feel bad. And it's all just in the cycle. The question is, is can you start paying attention to that whole cycle? And when you begin to cycle down you can say, okay, now I can make a change and turn that around and come back up. I don't have to go down into that rat hole. I don't have to go down that sewer. I can make a change here. And so that's one's right effort. And in the Buddha's language, that is to remove unwholesome thoughts from the mind and put wholesome thoughts in. Also, in the Anapanasati Sutra, it's referred to as gladdening the mind or perking up the mind. Or brightening the mind. That by perking it up and gladdening the mind, what we're actually doing is beginning to modify and change our attitude slightly. That when we were little kids, we were all born being dependent upon adults. No child can be born and be abandoned by his mom and expect to survive even a day or two. That's humans. Where alligators, they can lay their eggs in the sand and then go back into the water and let the eggs take care of themselves. Or turtles do that. Eggs from the bird are a little bit different, and that is that they need to feed the babies after they hatch, but only for a short time. And as soon as the babies have some feathers, off they fly away and they're on their own. So humans, though, take a long, long time to get ourselves up, each one of us, into where we can take care of ourselves. That in fact, in the very, very old days, it would have been like the age of 3 or 4. Then it went up about the age of 6 as civilization got started. In fact, that's why we put kids in school today, is because in the old days, 6-year-olds were good enough to go out into the fields to pick cotton or whatever. All right, and so this whole idea of a slow childhood leaves us with a lingering, lingering old childhood of dependency and being not able to take care of ourselves. And so what we do is we begin to feel like a victim, that we're a victim to our environment. We begin to get the idea that we're a victim of our environment, which is actually in severe cases would be known as being paranoid. Anxiety. What is paranoia? To think that everything's out to get me. Well, actually, that's just because you don't have the skills to manage whatever it is that's happening. And so whatever it is that's happening, you see, is dangerous, whether it's really dangerous or not. So what we have to do is start to rewire the mind that we had from childhood recognize that we're not dependent, that we are capable, that I am not a victim of my own mind, I am not a victim of my own feelings. And yet most people are. And we say it in our language. For instance, when somebody says, I am frustrated, or I am sad, or I am sorry, or I hate this, you know, this language is very common. And what that means is, is that when I say I am angry, that means the anger itself is now bigger and more important than the little old me. I become the anger without people recognizing that in that case, the I, whatever the I is, is all over the place. It's not a permanent thing. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Everything is temporary. Things arise and they pass away, including selfishness. And when selfishness arises, that's an indication of Dukkha. In other words, I'm not getting my way. I want and I don't get. Then in fact, a classic definition of Dukkha is wanting something you don't have. And so people go into meditation. Okay, Ron, so when we go into meditation, that means that now we can begin to see those thoughts. And what is meditation? That means that we're remembering to look. Remember to look and to change. Remember to look and to change. Sati, Mudita, and I forgot the Pali word for right effort. But anyway, taking the right effort to make the change over and over and over again. And as we do these three things over and over and over again, they begin to build skill. And that new skill that we're developing is actually in the Pali Samma Sanghappa, which is now the right attitude, the attitude that I can do this. The attitude of, oh, I can throw these hindrances out of my mind. Oh, I can do this. I can have an easy life. That's the right attitude.

**Speaker C:** Is that like finding an authority within yourself that you are the king of everything, of yourself? For me, this always made sense because I would never look for any teacher or anything like that. Just because of that note that for some reason always made sense that I have the authority to make the change. There is no teaching, there is nothing. It's within you that you have to keep looking.

**Speaker A:** Yes and no. The no part is that many people don't know what to look for, and so they wallow around in ignorance looking for the wrong thing, when in fact if they knew what to do And that's what these skills developments are doing. In other words, you can have an artisan, maybe he's a sculptor, uses chisels and rocks, but if that artisan doesn't have chisels and hammers, he can't do sculpture. If he's got rocks but no chisels and hammers, and then there's a possibility that he's got chisels and hammers and no rock. And so, basically what makes him a sculptor is not the chisels and the rock. What makes him a sculptor is that he keeps going, chisel and rock, and chisel and rock, and chisel and rock, and starts looking at what he's doing, and starts being careful about what he's doing, and he can turn that piece of rock into a beautiful piece of sculpture. Basically, that's what the human needs to do. He starts off as a rock that needs some chiseling done, take some of the weight off, find some of the things that are hidden within that rock, and we wind up with a beautiful piece of sculpture. But the point is that normally that rock does not have the skills of the sculptor, nor does he have the chisels and the hammers. So the whole point then of the Sangha is to help each other see the chiseling and the hammering, but each one of us has to do the work ourselves. But we need help with doing that. This is what the point was about the Buddha when he talked about it. He said that this is an old path. That I have rediscovered. It's always been here, and people in the past have seen that. And he said that people in the future will also see it for themselves, but it's a whole lot easier for it to be pointed out by someone who can see it rather than every one of us stumbling around, whole generations at a time, with not one person being able to figure it out. But we could pass it down from generation to generation, which is exactly what the Bhikkhu Sangha has been doing since the time of the Buddha, sometimes more effectively than others, in the sense that the Mahasi method is all hammer, no chisel. So that no hammer, all chisel, or all hammer, no chisel, means that all we can do is just beat on that rock without actually being able to sculpt it. The chisel is where we can take the pieces off, to whack that piece off. That unwholesome thought, throw it out in the mind right now. So this is the practice of Anapanasati, is that the most important quality is that gladdening the mind. Coming back over and over and over again. Never mind, start again. Never mind, start again. Oh, so what? Yeah, I feel bad. Never mind. And keep coming back to the wholesome thoughts. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** As I found, like, as I'm chiseling, I found out that I've been, like, removing some parts that you had, like, certain attachment to, like You could have built up this whole identity, this whole persona of yourself into these habits or things that you do in your life. And then as you start chiseling those things away, you start to lose yourself. So how does one see these things and not get frustrated with himself that he keeps losing these good parts that he thought he had about himself, but now he sees them as something that was just a false illusion?

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay. Well, the old habit of frustrations over loss comes into play. And you're telling me now that you can see that frustration. The question is, can you see it in time so that the thoughts of frustrations don't actually make you feel frustrated, that you can throw that frustrating thought out now? Yeah, because I feel like I did it wrong. What if I did this? What ifs. What about this? What if this, you know, what if I lose that, then what will happen? Those are just more what-if-isms.

**Speaker C:** I think it all escalates if you, as you said, if you allow these thoughts to continue to build up, you build them, you can either build them in a positive way or you can build them, you say, unwholesome way. And if you, I was gonna say, I was gonna say about something about Dark Night of the Soul, because I found that essentially as I kept chipping the Mahasi method, it would throw me into these really dark states because I was digging in shit, as you would call it. And as you're digging in shit and you're not seeing anything good about yourself, I'm not this, I'm not that, not this, not that. As you're seeing that, you get frustrated with yourself. Then you ask yourself the question, what am I in the end? What is me? And as you answer that question, what is you, you see that there's nothing left and you're left with this blank blank page. So what do you do with that blank page at that moment?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point then. That means that you can relax because there's nothing to it. Well, what's really going on though is that you want there to be something. You want to be something. All right, there's actually a better way of looking at it, and that is, uh, in Sutta Number 2 in the Sama Asaba Sutta, the Buddha talks about how looking at who am I in the present and what I'll become, or looking at who was I in the past. So dealing in the past and the future, or even in the present moment of who am I, is fraught with dangers. That is not the right question to ask. And so naturally you're going to become frustrated with who am I as a question. Why? Because the reality is, is that whoever you are, you're still a moving target. So anything thing that you point saying that's who you are, well, you've already moved over there. You're not— you're moving target. Yeah. All right, so, uh, this, this quality then is better, uh, a little bit better question would be to look at it from the perspective of who I am not. I am not these feelings. I am not this body. I am not this memory system and all of these memories. I am not even perception itself, the process of seeing what I think reality is rather than actually taking sensory input and experiencing reality. I have to make sense out of it. That making sense out of it is what we call the process of perception, naming it rather than just allowing it to come in. All right, and then the last one on it is, is that the one that the Christians get most confused about, and they think that I am consciousness itself. So when they go to heaven, it's the soul that goes to heaven. Okay, you heard that, right? There's a soul that goes to heaven. Except that when you think of the soul, you don't think of the soul as having eyes, because the soul doesn't have eyes, it doesn't have ears, it doesn't have any sensory awareness. So if a soul goes to heaven, how will that soul even know that it's in heaven unless it has some sort of consciousness that I am in heaven. Well, what's the evidence? Well, they say they have golden paved streets. Well, okay, if they have golden paved streets, how do you know that they're golden if you can't see them, right? So this is the whole point about the consciousness, is that you're not the consciousness either. But what you are is a product of those things after they're put together, just like a car. When it's spread all over the yard, the engine's over there, the seats are over there, the steering wheel's in the tree, you know, the rats eating the wiring and all of that kind of stuff. You don't have transportation, which was the original intention of the car. You have to put all that stuff back together into a system. And then you have transportation. So another example is an old-style wind-up alarm clock. That clock will function when it's put together, but if you take it apart and pull all the gears all around, then you don't have any ticking. You have to put it together, and then when you have the clock together, You have the ticking and you have the hand movement. But guess what? The hand itself does not know about the clock. The hand just thinks, I am the hand. Okay, so that's the way that we have to understand it, is that who you are is merely a product of a process of the mind that's based upon this body and this feeling and this perception and this consciousness and all of these memories together. These, by the way, these 5 things that I just mentioned are called the 5 aggregates. And the most important quality of the teaching of these 5 aggregates is that there is no self in there. A lot of people mistake it and say, I am the body. In fact, look at how many industries are in business. Look how many different industries and businesses there are that capitalize on people who believe that they are the body. An example of that is toothpaste. People will buy toothpaste because these are my teeth and I am told to take care of them. All right, so you have the clothing industry, the fashion industry, the shoe industry, the handbag industry. You have the cosmetic industry, you have the weightlifting industry, you have the sports industry. All of this is because of people making the delusion that I am the body Or in fact, you're not the body. And the body changes. If I am the body, then when all the cells of that 5-year-old died, why didn't that person die? He didn't. Those cells were replaced. Something new came in. But we fail to recognize that changing process. And so we don't recognize that I am a process. We recognize that I am this, that, or the other thing, which is part of that process. So that's the way of looking at it, is to look at it from the situation. I am not. I am not the feelings. I am not angry. I see anger. If there's a me in there, it's the one who observes the anger, not the one who is angry. So there's even a third level, and that third level is to stop paying attention to the self at all and start paying attention to the outcome of the self, and that is Dukkha. That's where the Buddha comes in. That— and when he talks about it, he doesn't talk about it in the sense of Dukkha is some sort of concept. No, he looks at it in the sense of this is Dukkha right here. This is Dukkha, and this is the cause of Dukkha, and this is the end of Dukkha. That's the way that we look at it, is that I'm experiencing, I see the Dukkha in the mind right now, which means I woke up and I looked. Now it's time to make a change, to gladden the mind, to come out of it right then and there. Over and over and over again we practice that, and then the attitude begins to change from the attitude of a loser who needs somebody else's help into the winner of knowing that you've got this wired. You can handle this, you can take care of anything. The Buddha was known as a lion. This is the lion's attitude. The lion is the one who is the boss of his own life. Most people, when they're talking to the boss, if the boss comes up and starts asking them a question, we immediately go into he's the bigger and I'm the little. He's the big guy and I'm the little guy. It's hard to come up to the point that no, I'm just as good as he is. And in fact, because you're a Dharma dude, you're actually better than he is. He may be a boss, but That's his delusion.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what I was saying about authority. Once you see the authority within yourself, you cannot be a victim anymore in any situation— in talking to your boss, and in Dharma, and in life, in anything.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, if you're a victim, what we're a victim to is that anxiety. That's what we're victims of, is our own feelings. And we're a victim of our feelings because we don't know them very well. And when we know them, that means that we can make good friends with them. And as we make good friends with our feelings, we recognize that, hey, these feelings, this survival instinct has kept me alive my whole life, that it made me breathe at night when I wasn't conscious. It made the heart beat. So this is survival. This instinct of survival has benefits, but it's overburdened. That is actually primitive. The survival instincts of the human were developed in the situation of a jungle, and we don't live in the jungle anymore. We live in a society now, and yet that primitive mechanism keeps going off in the sense of false positives left, right, and center. We think this is dangerous and that's dangerous when things are not dangerous at all. Just because we don't pay the electric bill doesn't mean that I'm going to die. The electric company just turns the power off. Well, maybe I can start to use my night vision now, develop some skills here. I don't need power.

**Speaker C:** Tapping into the neighbors.

**Speaker A:** Ah, right. If you need to read something, go over to the neighbor's house with your book and read under their light. In fact, this is something quite interesting about Wat Suan Mokkh. Marcus is familiar that in the really old days when I was there in the 1980s, even the city of Chaya didn't have electric power. The only power that was in the entire area was in the generator that was at Wat Suan Mokkh that was maintained by the monks and laymen and Power was donated, but the generator only ran for a short period of time, starting a little after sundown, about 6 or 7 in the evening, and it would run till about 9 or 10, which means that's the only time that you had electric fans. That was the only time you had any evening time, and that would be so that the monks could get back to their kutis and get settled in, and then lights out. But all day long, no electric power. I found that amazingly difficult in the beginning and amazingly freeing over time. But we have become completely dependent upon electric power. Here on the island, the power goes off on a regular basis, and every time the power goes off, I have to check how I feel about the power goes off, because ultimately it's okay that the power goes off. So the computers are down, so this is down, so what? I'm okay. But in our society, oh, you don't pay that electric bill, that's a kind of sentence of death. And we become afraid about this, that, and the other thing, where in fact this is not even worthy of fear from a wise physician, but it is worthy of fear from a child's physician. And so we're going to change that attitude. And how do we change it? Very slowly over time, by keep talking ourselves into feeling good, talking ourselves into feeling good over and over and over and over again. Everything's all right, everything is fine, there are no worries, there are no troubles, this moment is good enough. And we start to develop satisfaction. But that satisfaction doesn't come so long as there's still fear. That fear is the basic emotion, and we're not going to really get anywhere until we deal with the fear. And you probably heard that the Buddha is actually quite big on fearlessness. There's suttas about it, but in fact, in one of the suttas, he actually goes off into one of these haunted, dangerous places. It was actually close to Bodh Gaya because it was a swamp. As, you know, deep southern swamps with swamp gas and crazy animals and all that kind of stuff. And humans don't like to go there. And then the humans eventually get the idea that that place is haunted because it was naturally dangerous anyway, and the only people who are still there are the ones who died there. And so the Buddha would go to these places and hang out. With the idea that when fear arose, he was just going to stand there and examine the fear. Because the reality is, is that right now there are no snakes crawling up my leg. Reality is that there really is nothing right here, right now, that is dangerous other than my thought about this is a dangerous place. And then we have places like— have you ever heard the name Abhayagiri? It's the Arahant's lineage, what, in Northern California? The word Abhaya— the word bhaya is actually the word for fear in the Pali, and Abhaya means not fear. And giri is actually the word for hill, so it would be then translated possibly wrongly as Fearless Mountain. But in English, the word fearlessness has a different quality than what we're looking for. That fearlessness is actually what the warrior would have as he goes into battle. It's called courage. In other words, he's going to get on top of his fear and go do what he wants to do anyway. All right. So he looks and appears fearless. But what is happening actually is a war within. That he's getting over his fear. But we're looking at it from a different perspective, and that is that we're looking for the words not fearless but safe and secure. Safe and secure are nurturing words. Everything is okay, everything is safe. Now that's a better definition of the word Upaya. So it could actually be translated as safe mountain or secure mountain. Rather than fearless mountain. Fearless has a too tough a quality to it that we don't need so much. In other words, the warrior who is truly secure and safe and comfortable is not putting on his armor, getting ready to go to battle, because the guy that he's going to go to battle with is actually his friend. And there's nothing dangerous here. That would be secure. And so this is the way we want to start looking at our environment, is that it's actually a safe and secure place, at least the environment that you're in right now. I mean, look at around the room that you're in and you recognize there's actually no snakes on the floor crawling up your leg. There's no alligators. Everything is actually okay right now. And so we have to give ourselves that little, uh, hit, that little juice, that little sugar of saying everything really is okay right now. Everything is safe, it's not dangerous. And we start working with that over and over and over again, and we start developing that as a new habit of everything is safe, everything's secure, rather than having the thoughts of what about this and what about that going on. The what about is the reality is everything is safe. And so we keep looking at it and seeing, yeah, the reality is that things are safe. Nothing to do and no place to go, and right now everything's okay. And so we keep playing that one over and over and over and over again, and pretty soon we begin to feel that way. We do feel Anicca state. And so now we're practicing that in our meditation. And as we walk into the office and there's the, uh, the boss with an angry expression on his face, and most people will bring that fear back up— what if, what if he's angry at me? What have I done wrong? What if this? What is that? But in fact, possibly the best way to see the boss when he's angry like that is to just say, hi boss, I'm so happy to see you. And give him a big smile. He may change his expression right there. But if we become afraid because we see danger in the face of the boss, then now we're going to be in that one-down victim's position. He's going to be the one on top. So we have to remember, have to wake up, wake up and smell the coffee. Wake up and recognize, hey, I can handle this. What, angry boss? I've seen angry bosses before. Been there, done that. I know what to do with an angry boss. I smile at him.

**Speaker C:** For me, fear, as far as I've been, I've been doing martial arts most of my life and I've been in confrontational situations. It caused me to face certain fear. And then the fear is usually, what if I get injured? And then Eventually, sometimes I would get injured and then the injury wouldn't even be so bad. I would be even more relaxed when I got injured because the fear itself of the injury was already bigger than the injury itself. Like, you break an arm, you break a leg, a bit of pain here and there is fine, but the fear of it is what actually causes the suffering. That's when I realized, oh, the mind is what causes the suffering, really.

**Speaker A:** It's not the injury itself.

**Speaker C:** Not the injury. I almost laugh through a lot of pain nowadays because I'm like, hey, here's the mind making the situation bigger than it is.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I would say this, that there is a long old tradition in various countries in Asia of the various people who were engaged in some sort of martial activities become monks and become very good ones very quickly, simply because of this issue of learning two skills. One is to deal with this moment by putting aside the fear and doing what's needed to be done. That in fact, if the old martial artist, the master, is surrounded by young thugs about to beat him up, if he becomes afraid of them, they will beat him up. But if he remembers all of his skills one instant at a time, he will use that skill one instant at a time, and within 3 to 5 seconds, he's mastered all of them. All right. So that sort of martial artist then makes really good material for meditation because he's already been developing the skill to be here now. Because in fact, if he is in a combat situation, hand-to-hand, weapons, no weapons, whatever like that, if all of a sudden he starts to think about the argument that he had with his girlfriend, he's going to get his face smashed in.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's not possible to do that. You can't really think about something when the confrontation is going on.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. You got to pay attention to what's going on right now. So that's a skill that's developed. So you can use that skill now to remember to start playing dodgeball or start playing dodge with these big fists of anxiety that keep getting into your face so that you can learn to dodge those things, move out of the way, make a change. Don't let them hit you. Do some blocking, do some foot shuffle so that you can lean in, you know, judo, so that you can just lean out of the way. That's the way. So the anger of the face of the boss then doesn't hit us, but the anger of the boss is coming right direction, like here, and so we move over here. So that we miss it. There's no me there to get hit. But this is a skill that needs to be practiced, not just with martial arts, but with verbal slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, rather than fists and nunchucks and sai, and the whole list of things. So actually what we're saying is, is that we're developing the skill of learning to play dodgeball with all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that come our way from the outside, by dealing with those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that we keep throwing at ourselves on the inside. And when we get the inside straightened out, then we can deal with the outside handsomely. Because when we see that angry boss, it's not the angry boss that we're looking at across the room, it's the angry boss we've got in our head that we're afraid of. It's our perception of him, not him himself. But in fact, he may say when you smile at him, he may say, oh, I'm just tired. And he wasn't angry at all. We thought he was angry because of our perception of he's probably angry at me because of blah blah blah. What about isms, you see? So this is the actual practice of Anapanasati. And a lot of people think that all meditation is done squatting on the floor. But no, that squatting on the floor time, which is actually quite valuable, useful, and wholesome when it's done correctly, is developing the very skills that we need so that we can go into work and dodge all the slings and arrows of angry bosses and whatnot. And so it's a two-step operation. But if we say, oh, if I just sit in meditation, it will develop all the skills that I need right then and there so that now everything will be okay out in the world. No, that's not going to happen. What we're having to do is being in that meditation time is to build up the skills that we now need to put into practice. So actually, when I say put into practice, that means that we need to perform these skills. We practice the skills in silence or in seclusion, and then when we get out in the world, we perform them, and when we get really good at performing them, then we can just play with them, so that all the world is just play, like the Hindus say, "Lila," or as Shakespeare said, "All the world's a stage, and every one of us is an actor." Have you ever heard that? I forgot what one of the plays it comes out of. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Maybe Hamlet.

**Speaker A:** Ah yeah, there's a lot of stuff is in Hamlet. Me think the lady doth protest too much is in Hamlet. Some of his best lines are in Hamlet. To be or to not be. So I would believe that one too. Um, so all the world's a stage and each one of us— oh no, it's wrong.

**Speaker B:** It's, uh, As You Like It. There you go then, As You Like It.

**Speaker A:** As You Like It. Okay, all right. So in all the world's a stage and each one of us is players, there is one more point to it, and that is, is that not only we are players on the stage, but we are reading a script. What is the script we're reading? The script that we learned of who I am in childhood. And so the whole quality then is to close the book, stop reading the script, and start paying attention to what's going on on the stage. And pretty soon you can recognize, hey, wait a minute, all these people on the stage are just reading their own script and I don't really belong here. So I can go down and sit in the audience, which is, by the way, pretty empty in this theater. And I've got a lot of room here in the audience because everybody that I know is on stage reading a script. So this is another way of looking at it, is that we can learn to stop reading the script of the mind and start reprogramming it so that we can just enjoy the show, which means now that we're in sensory input, we're taking in new data rather than being on stage reading old data.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, what do you think about Bill Murray? The actor?

**Speaker A:** Yes, Bill Murray, I know him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he said, "I mean, he's a pretty chill guy," he said, "This is not a dress rehearsal, this is your life," you know?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's right, everything is just as it is, this is life. And in fact, we could say that if childhood is the dress rehearsal for the adult's life? Why is it that we never come out of being children and still think that we're in rehearsal, where there's going to be somebody who's going to stop the show and yell at us for doing it wrong? Where in fact, in theater, you've probably heard the expression, "The show must go on." In other words, it doesn't matter what tragedy befalls the actor, he can just drop dead on the stage and all the other actors just make it part of the show, that they're picking up their dead body and throwing it out, and then on with the show. But no, we have the idea that everything is a dress rehearsal and everything is important. But when we're adults, that means that we have the attitude of— and by the way, that dress rehearsal is the quality of you're not ready yet, you're still a victim. Dress rehearsal is a bunch of victims getting together, proving themselves that they're not victims anymore, that they're winners and they can do the show. So this is not a dress rehearsal, as Bill Murray says. This is it. And guess what? There's nobody there standing there with a script. You can ad-lib your way through life now, and you can become chill. There's no reason to continue to do it the old way. We have to make a change.

**Speaker C:** I think when you say child, you mean like a child as you've been structured by authority to do this, to do that. But I've been having this longing to go back to this childhood mindset of worry-free. Nothing is a problem. I want to just play around with my friends. I want to go slide off the slides. I want to enjoy the snow. That's what I've been trying, longing for, to go back to almost. Almost feels like.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, the things that you mentioned for the longing is actually more, or let us say, later things. The reality of the situation is that when an infant is born, he is nurtured and taken care of. If he doesn't, that child will die. And even after 2 days of birth, a new infant, when he does his first poopy after 2 or 3 days, everybody is so, so happy to see that big yellow turd come out because that shows that the digestive system is working, as opposed to the child getting fatter and fatter and fatter after 5 or 6 or 8 days and he hasn't taken a crap yet. That's really dangerous, right? And so every mommy— and in fact, I've seen women take that turd, put it in a napkin, and show it off to their friends. But that 16-year-old boy, or that boy that grows up that laid that turd, now he takes a dump in the living room floor. And what's the people going to do? They're not going to be proud of his new turd. Not at all. No. Something happens in our childhood that changes us, and that happens at about the age of 6 when we're put to work. You're told to go to school. You're told to pick up your clothes, do your homework, put down your cell phone. Do what you're told to do. And we lose that very young childhood playfulness that we had at the age of 3 and 4. How can we maintain that feeling of 3 and 4 when Mommy is now putting us to work? She's nurturing us a little bit, but that nurturing now has a whole lot of 'you got to go do this, that, and the other thing in order to get my nurturing.' It becomes conditional love now. And what you're longing for is to go back to that unconditional love time, back to the nurturing, away from the critical mom. So moms either are going to be critical, like, do your homework, I'm going to check it, or they're going to be nurturing. I love you so much. And somewhere in another along the way, mom gets more and more critical and less and less nurturing. And we miss that. Well, guess what? Now you recognize that. You can say that that means that it's my job to go back and give me the nurturing that I lost in childhood and resented losing. I can go give that self— I could give that to myself. I could start nurturing my mind to now nurture the mind rather than being critical. The criticism, by the way, is the what-ifism. What if this, and what if that, and you got to go do this, you got to go do that. And you can change that do. Oh no, you're okay. I'll do it all for you. Everything is all right. Just relax. Just enjoy yourself. What, you want to go skiing? Go skiing. Okay, enjoy. Go enjoy your life. You don't have to long for it and not have it. Then whenever the thought comes up about longing for it, you say, oh, I've got it right now. Yeah, I can just Take a deep breath and just feel nurtured. Feel free. That's exactly what it is all about, is learning to go back to that early stage of childhood to where the whole world was a wonder. The whole world was just one more toy to play with. Things have not gotten important. The critical mind is what makes things important. The reality is there's nothing important. Very little is a matter of life or death. Almost never is it a matter of life or death. And yet the fear tells us that everything is a matter of life and death. And so now that you know about that longing for that nurturing state of mind, you can go nurture yourself, bring that back. Go let yourself feel like you were 2 years old again. Taking that doll apart or taking that toy apart, taking that alarm clock apart without any care or worries that you'll have to— you'll be able to get it back together again. That's not the issue. The issue is I'm having fun taking it apart. The critical mind is there. Oh, you got to put it back together again. No, you don't.

**Speaker C:** You know what I'm realizing? I'm almost like tearing up right now because I realized I've been nurturing myself with certain addictions throughout this time, but that's what I was longing for. Even when you said longing, that word longing, that's what I was longing for when I'm engaging in some sort of these rituals and habits of addictions. Is that nurturing? Is that what you're looking for constantly? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So nurture yourself, give yourself that juicy ice cream of the mind. Make yourself feel pleasure. In fact, intentional pleasure. Intentionally make yourself feel really good, really satisfied, which is also freedom from fear. That of the little child who's being nurtured is not afraid. The child who is afraid is the one who is drawing his ABCs worried that somebody's going to say he's doing it wrong. And that's where the fear comes in. The fear of every child in the Western world is retrained from the fear of real danger into the fear of the artificial dangers of our society. So everything that you wind up being afraid of now is not actually a matter of life or death anymore. So you don't have to be afraid if you wake up to it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm really glad we got into this because like, as I think this was the missing part, is the, as you said, Maharshi Method is just looking. So I was able to look at it all the time, but I did not know how to replace it. So this addiction, addiction, addiction issue kept staying and staying because I couldn't replace it with something else. But now that I can take my own charge and replace it from within with my own nurture, I can move past these addictions. I don't want to say get over it because there's nothing to get over it.

**Speaker A:** It's just seeing that in this moment you can get over it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Long term, we're not interested in. We're just wanting to get rid of it right this very minute. That's where we're developing the skill. If you have the idea, oh, I've got to get rid of this long term, which is the way the Demasi Method Then we're not making any progress. The progress is made when you say, never mind about the future. Right now I don't have to feel worried. Right now I don't have to feel anxious. Never mind about the future. Let me at least develop the skill right now, and then maybe 10 minutes from now I can do it again, over and over and over again. This needs to be practiced. Why? Because you have been practicing being unhappy since you were about 3 or 4 years old. Practicing doing what you were told to do, practicing trying to fit in. And now you don't have to worry about fitting in. In fact, you can recognize, oh, that's like that thing called society is really not worth fitting into. Why should I stand on stage trying to read the script as best I can to get it right? In order to fit in on this crowded stage? Why don't I just close this book and go sit down and enjoy the show? Well, we were taught that we had to participate when we were kids. That's the whole point about the critical mind state. And so we remain critically minded of ourselves. And you have actual now permission to go nourish yourself. Everything's really okay. The things are not nearly as desperate as people make out. So I'm glad that you've gotten some benefit out of this, Carl. This has been good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. Now I'm tapping into— I can feel like a lot of pressure easing off the body, but I understand that this is moment to moment that I have to ease that pressure because that pressure comes back as soon as they say, okay, that's enough, that's enough, I can stop now, you can go back to the old way. And it's not. You have to find yourself again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just remember it right now. You're okay right now to remember the Sati. Look at what we're doing and make a change right now. You're okay. And if you wake up, you remember to wake up and you're already having a mind full of wholesome thoughts, and you can congratulate yourself. Yeah, I'm already okay. Nothing to do here. And so we keep practicing this over and over again, these skills. The skill actually we refer to as the skill of just a little bit of satisfaction. You get yourself into a small state of satisfaction. This is okay, I can handle this. And then that state of satisfaction as a skill will start to grow, so you become more and more and more satisfied. To the point of yippee-ki-yay, this is satisfying. And then that mellows out too. It's all a process. So practicing satisfaction— everything is all right, everything is fine, no worries. Well, Carl, I hope to see you again. Let's go ahead and finish this up, and, and we can talk some more. There's a lot more to it, but this is the, the folks— the point of turning things around. The turning things around is to nurture yourself, to remember that you're already okay. You don't have to do anything to be okay. You're already okay. You can feel safe and secure, comfortable, and satisfied. So Marcus, do you have anything to add?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm just enjoying the show.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, Carl, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker C:** Oh, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. You can call, uh, on Skype. I think you already know how. Uh, this, uh, this group that we're in now, the UK group, um, you can actually start a call in that too, um, but maybe nobody will see it because it's got too many people, and because of that, Skype doesn't automatically send out notices. But you can find the Skype name of Dhammarato, and then you can call anytime in the daytime. I'm really glad to meet you. I've got a lot of friends. Today we haven't talked about it much, but eventually I want to talk to you about the Sangha, which is the third item of the Triple Gem. The Western Buddhists are really interested in the Buddha and the Dhamma. But the real show is in the Sangha. That's the community of wise people, the community of the nobles. That's when things really happen.

**Speaker C:** I actually, before I even talked to you right now, I was in past couple Sanghas because the way I make Sangha— I'm going to relate to my martial arts again— when we're doing sparring, you have 3 levels of sparring. You have to spar somebody better than you, somebody on your level and then somebody who's much worse than you, so you can actually pass on the knowledge and you can learn a lot. You have like pointers from somebody who's better than you, then you have competitive levels of somebody who's on the same level with you, and then you can pass on the knowledge who's a beginner.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know, I've been a beginner. I've had the tar beat out of me. Yeah. And so that's how they— here's actually a story that I'll tell you in that regard. In the martial arts group that I was in, don't give me much details. A guy came into the class and was introduced by the senpai as having just gotten out of prison, and he hadn't been doing any martial arts for like 5 years or so. And so the deal was, is that the karate master would let him back in, but he had to start all over again with the white belt and then the yellow belt and then the green belt and the blue belt and the brown belt and then a black belt again. Okay, so all of that. And so I was in the stage there of just getting a brown belt. And this guy had gone through it. Well, the brown belts is where you're actually doing some physical activity. All right. And this guy, in the process of learning this kata, this guy threw his left arm down. And when I hit it, it felt like it was hitting a brick wall. And I learned a lesson right there. You've got to make your arm a brick wall. If you don't, it's going to get broken if it's a soft piece of meat. He taught me a lesson right then. He almost broke my arm, and all he did is just put it down, and I did all the breaking by hitting him. And I will never forget that. And in fact, I think I've kept myself from having broken bones by letting the muscles do the work. Rather than the bone. It's better to get bruised than broken bone. And so that's the idea of— and that, by the way, is in the Goju-ryu. You've probably heard of that method of making the arms very strong. Some of the films that I've seen, they do it like this and say, ah, and breathe out, and then Breathe in and then breathe out like that. All the muscles of the arm are completely just as tough and as strong as you can make them. Okay, that's the hard part, the go part of the ju, goju, the hard soft. And the hard is really, really hard. I know because this guy nearly broke my arm. I had— because I'd been playing with all of the other students, you know, and everybody's arms are whatever soft, and it was literally like I hit my— I with my right arm hitting his left arm, that it was like hitting a tree, it was like hitting a brick or a brick wall with it, it was that hard. I mean, it was such a surprise. And so, that's one of the examples of an advanced student teaching a young student a lesson. That was a major lesson for me. So I very much appreciate that we can work with and use the skill of martial arts as kind of a base for your Anapanasati practice, as opposed to the Mahasi method, because the Mahasi method keeps people in a victim's position to where the martial arts training, like I just demonstrated That's a lion, that's tough. You got to get that stuff going and you know that you can get it going. And so that whole attitude about the martial arts— have you ever heard of Musashi? I mean, Musashi? Yeah, right. There's a clear example of it. That warrior, he's an interesting story, but the end of the story was he said he used the skills of his martial arts to practice the Zen meditation, and he got very quick results because he had already developed so many of the skills that the beginning meditator will need. Like when you get knocked down, you pick yourself up, you dust yourself off, and you get right back in the game. But the losers will lay in the mud for a while. And so, um, that's actually— congratulations on that. That's a good skill to come into meditation practice with, is the knowledge that you can handle it. You can handle the pain. You can handle this. There's nothing to it. You can nurture yourself.

**Speaker C:** I think my favorite quote is from Lao Tzu. He says like, even if the mountain falls on my head, I will go through this practice. Even if the mountains were to fall on my head, that's always stuck with me. Even if the mountains have to fall on my head, that's the kind of attitude.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's an attitude, isn't it? Because real mountains don't fall on real people, but the idea, that concept of, yeah, I can handle anything. So you can handle this, and you're now— you're going to learn to handle it with nurturing. Yeah, excellent. Okay guys, well, thank you so much. This has been a really great call, and I hope to see you again, Carl.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was a blast.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker C:** Take care, guys.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends including Carl (Speaker C) and Marcus (Speaker B), focuses on the practical application of Buddhist meditation to overcome anxiety, fear, and unwholesome mental habits. Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: Anxiety and "What-If-ism"**
*   The discussion begins with Carl's experience of stopping meditation because it didn't seem to help, only to later realize he needed it most during anxious moments at work.
*   Dhammarato identifies the root of much anxiety as **"what-if-ism"**—the mental habit of worrying about future possibilities or dwelling on past events. This creates danger in the mind where none exists in reality (e.g., fearing an envelope containing a bill).
*   This pattern is a misuse of our primitive survival instinct, which now triggers fear responses to modern, non-life-threatening situations.

### **Critique of Common Meditation (Mahasi Method)**
*   Dhammarato suggests that a common approach (like the Mahasi noting method) can be incomplete. Merely observing or "noting" anxiety (dukkha) without actively changing the mind state can leave one "digging in shit" and stuck in negative cycles.
*   The talk emphasizes that **insight alone is not enough**; it must be paired with **active intervention**.

### **The Buddha's Prescription: Active Transformation**
*   The true teaching of the Buddha, as presented here, is **to see dukkha (suffering/anxiety) and immediately change it**.
*   The core practice is **Right Effort**: removing unwholesome thoughts and replacing them with wholesome ones **in the present moment**. This is the "missing piece" or the "chisel" needed to sculpt the mind.
*   The formula is: **Remember (Sati) → Look (Right View) → Change (Right Effort)**. This must be practiced repeatedly to build skill.

### **Key Practices and Attitude Shifts**
1.  **Gladdening the Mind:** Actively perk up, brighten, and nurture the mind with wholesome, positive thoughts. Talk yourself into feeling good and safe, as you have spent a lifetime talking yourself into feeling bad.
2.  **Cultivating Safety and Security:** Recognize that in the present sensory moment, you are actually safe. Replace "what-if" thoughts with "everything is okay right now." This is a nurturing, secure fearlessness, not a warrior's courage.
3.  **Shifting Authority Inward:** Develop the "lion's attitude" or internal authority. You are not a victim of your feelings, your boss, or your environment. You have the power to change your mental state.
4.  **Embracing Impermanence (Anicca):** See mental states as cycles. "Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't." Don't hate the down cycles; recognize them and use your skill to turn the mind upward.
5.  **Moving Beyond the "Self" Inquiry:** Asking "Who am I?" leads to frustration because the self is a process, not a fixed thing. Instead, focus on the **five aggregates** (body, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) and see that there is no permanent self within them. Focus on the outcome—dukkha—and end it.

### **Practical Applications and Metaphors**
*   **Life as a Stage:** We are often reading a childhood script of dependency and criticism. Close the script, stop performing, and go sit in the audience to enjoy the show of sensory reality.
*   **Martial Arts Mindset:** Carl's martial arts background is praised as excellent training for meditation. The skills of being present, dodging blows, and getting up after being knocked down are directly applicable to "dodging" mental arrows of anxiety and fear.
*   **Sculpting the Self:** Like a sculptor with a chisel (right effort) and hammer (mindfulness), we must actively shape our mind, removing unwholesome parts to reveal a beautiful statue.
*   **Reclaiming Childhood Nurturing:** The longing for a carefree childhood is really a longing for unconditional nurturing and safety. We must learn to give this nurturing to ourselves now, replacing the inner critic with an inner caregiver.

### **Role of the Sangha**
*   The Sangha (spiritual community) is essential. It provides the tools, guidance, and supportive relationships needed for growth, like fellow martial artists training together at different skill levels.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a call to move beyond passive observation to **active, moment-to-moment mental transformation**. The path is to nurture oneself, cultivate immediate satisfaction and safety, and repeatedly use the formula of **remembering, looking, and changing** to break the lifelong habit of anxiety and build a mind of security and wholesomeness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist practice, anxiety, and self-transformation. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Sculptor:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **The Rock:** The untrained, burdened self with habits and attachments.
    *   **The Chisel:** The ability to remove unwholesome thoughts (the specific, skillful action).
    *   **The Hammer:** The general noting/awareness practice (like in the Mahasi method).
    *   **The Sculptor:** The practitioner developing skill. The point is that you need both the hammer (awareness) *and* the chisel (active replacement of thoughts) to shape the rock into a beautiful sculpture (a peaceful, free mind).

2.  **The Stage / Theater:**
    *   We are all actors on a stage, reading from a **script** written in childhood (conditioned behaviors, fears, societal rules).
    *   The practice is to **close the script**, stop performing, and **go sit in the audience** to simply observe the play. This represents moving from being lost in thought to being a mindful witness.

3.  **Wake Up and Smell the Coffee:** Framed as a metaphor for *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing).
    *   **Wake up:** Remembering (Sati) to be present.
    *   **Smell:** Sensory awareness (the inhale).
    *   **Take a sip:** The next moment of sensory engagement (the continuation of practice). It's about moving from conceptual thought to sensory "here and now."

4.  **Dodgeball / Martial Arts:** Used to describe dealing with mental and external challenges.
    *   Anxiety, angry bosses, and negative thoughts are like **slings, arrows, or punches** being thrown at you.
    *   Meditation builds the skill to **dodge, block, or shuffle** out of the way—to not let them "hit" you (affect your peace of mind).
    *   The "angry boss" is often just our **perception** (a punch we throw at ourselves); the skill is to not be there to get hit by our own mental projection.

5.  **The Cycle / Circle:**
    *   Life and moods are natural **cycles** (north, south, east, west; sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't).
    *   Suffering comes from hating the down part of the cycle. Freedom comes from **seeing the whole cycle** and knowing you can influence it, not having to go "down the rat hole."

6.  **The Alarm Clock / Car:** Used to explain the concept of "no-self" (*anatta*) and the Five Aggregates.
    *   A dismantled **alarm clock** or **car** has no function. Only when the parts are assembled does "ticking" or "transportation" emerge.
    *   Similarly, "you" are a process that emerges from the temporary assembly of body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. There is no permanent, separate "self" in any one part.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Envelope:** A story about an **electric bill envelope** sitting on a table that triggers fear and anxiety. It illustrates how we create fear ("false positives") about conceptually dangerous but physically harmless things in our modern, safe environment.

2.  **The Gecko / Tick:** A short story about primitive **self-preservation instinct**. A gecko runs from a moving hand, a tick tries to hide. This instinct is essential in the jungle but now fires inappropriately in our safe society, causing anxiety about non-life-threatening things.

3.  **Wat Suan Mokkh in the 1980s:** A personal anecdote about living in a monastery **without constant electricity**. It highlights our modern **dependency** and how we equate comfort (like electricity) with survival, creating unnecessary fear when it's absent.

4.  **The Martial Arts Lesson:** A story from the speaker's past where a **released prisoner with a "brick wall" arm** nearly broke his arm during practice. This taught him the lesson of **true resilience (the "Go" in Goju-ryu)** and became a metaphor for developing the mental toughness needed for meditation—turning the arm from "soft meat" into a strong, resilient tool.

5.  **Childhood Development:** A narrative about how **unconditional love and nurturing** in early childhood (ages 2-4) is replaced by **conditional love and criticism** around age 6 (school, chores). Our longing for that early safety is what drives addiction and anxiety. The practice is to become the **nurturing parent to yourself** that you lost.

6.  **The Buddha in the Haunted Swamp:** A reference to suttas where the Buddha would go to **"haunted," feared places** to confront fear directly. The point is that the danger was in the **thought**, not the reality of the present moment ("no snakes crawling up my leg").

### **Recurring Conceptual Analogies**

*   **What-if-ism / Whataboutism:** Framed as the **psychopath's tool** (deflecting blame) and the **anxious person's trap** (spiraling into hypothetical dangers).
*   **PhD in Dukkha:** A pun saying everyone has a "Ph.D." in suffering—**Piled Higher and Deeper**.
*   **The Lion's Attitude vs. The Victim's Attitude:** The **lion** is the boss of its own life (secure, fearless). Most people have a **victim's attitude** (dependent, fearful, one-down).
*   **All Hammer, No Chisel:** A critique of methods (like Mahasi) that emphasize only **noting awareness** without the active component of **replacing unwholesome with wholesome thoughts**.

These metaphors and stories work together to translate abstract Buddhist concepts (*Dukkha*, *Anicca*, *Anatta*, *Right Effort*, the Five Aggregates) into relatable, modern experiences, emphasizing **agency, self-nurturing, and perceptual change**.
