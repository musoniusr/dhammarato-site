### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Is it running? Can you— either one of you see? All right, well, welcome to the Saturday morning call. It's Thailand time. That means that it's what, uh, 10 PM Eastern Standard Time, uh, or actually Eastern Daylight Saving Time. So anyway, We have a couple of points to talk about. One is that people in general are getting angry, and the other question was about uncertainty and anxiety. So we'll see if we can talk about those things. The first point is that when the, let us say, the political system seems to have gotten in the United States especially very angry. But it looks like there's a lot of anger going on, what with the war in Europe and Ukraine and Russia, and nobody's getting along. Everybody wants something. And that The way to look at it, first off, is that what's happening out there is not our problem, even if it's— you know, there's an out there that's way out there, like other countries or what's on the news or what's on the media. And then there's the what's out there that's really close by, the people who are around us. And that, as Anna had mentioned, there are people who come to her and are affected by all of that anger that they're seeing on the news.

**Speaker B:** And every Middle East— I would not talk about now about Russians. Middle East now, it's more, more, more hot right now. Middle East much more hot right now than Slavic people.

**Speaker A:** Well, everything happens in cycles, but there's some of those cycles are very long and very broad. One thing that you can say is, is that the society is really angry right now all over the world. People are upset and uptight, not getting what they want, and that anger in general causes uncertainty. You hear they're angry out there, and then you don't know what's going to happen, and so that will give you uncertainty and anxiety. And that anxiety then can erupt in your own anger. The question is, can we see what's happening on the inside and make a change to that? Because we don't have a lot of control over the outside. People are going to be angry because of the press, they're going to be angry because of the news, they're going to be angry because of things happening way out there. And their anger actually is because of their uncertainty, their doubt, their worry, their fears, their anxieties. And that we pass that stuff around to one another, that— and it happens subconsciously. In other words, we hear somebody angry and we have an that has an effect upon us. The question is, can we see that effect and then do something about it? That's the important thing, is that whatever is happening out there, if the society is uptight, if the society is angry, if the society is full of doubt, full of uncertainty, full of anxiety about that, that stuff is going to be passing around. And so there's actually two ways to deal with it, always two ways to deal with it. And the two ways to deal with it is on the inside and on the outside. Now what I mean by that is, is that if we are having trouble dealing with it on the outside The best solution to that is to get away from it. I would highly recommend that if you are listening to the news, or listening to the media about all the stuff that's happening, and that has an effect upon you, the best thing to do is to stop. Stop listening to the media. Stop listening to the news. And you'll say, "Oh, well, I can't stop, because I'm worried about what's going to happen with those lawsuits, I'm going to be worried about what's happening with those court cases, I'm going to be worried about what's happening with that war, or the other war, and the next war that's coming along." And the answer to that is, stay away from it, because The only possible thing that you can get out of that is the bad feelings that they're trying to sell. The important thing to remember about the media is that they have a motto: "If it bleeds, it leads." So they want to talk about war, they want to talk about violence. Why? Because listening about violence and about war and about angry and about conflict creates our anxiety, and we want to know. And so people will become what they call news junkies, when in fact we can't do anything about it. So the question that we can actually start asking ourselves is, what value do we get in paying attention to the news. Is it merely entertaining? A lot of people start listening to the news because they find it entertaining, but eventually we get sucked into it. When you go to a play like a drama, the whole point about going to the play is entertainment, but we wind up getting sucked into and become identified with the characters. And so we like this country and we don't like that country, and so the conflict keeps us going back and forth. So when something happens good with that political party or that country or that person, then we feel good, and when something bad happens to them, then we feel bad. And the easy way is to stop listening to the media. Get away from the media altogether, because we're not going to be able to do much about it. And we certainly can begin to control our own thoughts, because we're not being influenced by that outside world. And so also in that regard, that would be the advice that you can give to all of your friends and people who are close by, maybe your clients, to stop listening to the media. Just stop. Because the whole point of the media is to get you involved, and the whole point of the Dharma is to get uninvolved. Stop taking things personally. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says, "Nothing is worth clinging to as 'I,' 'me,' or 'mine.'" And look, the whole world has gotten outraged and unhappy, full of rage, full of violence, lots of wars going on, and everybody's miserable basically because they want to know what the outcome is. How is this going to work out? What effect is it going to have me, not recognizing that it's already having an effect upon us. And the effect that we have is that we don't feel good about what's going on. We're full of doubt, we're full of worry. And so the way to deal with it, first off, is to get away from it. That's the first recommendation: don't deal with it. Now there are certain cases to where there are certain things that, let us say, it's advantageous to deal with them, in the sense of the people around us. And so, the way that we can deal with them also, is by not only just recommending that they stay away from the media, but that they can also begin to deal with people without their own anger. We can say, we can calm down. We have to remember, this is what the Dharma really is all about, is to remember how things affect us. We're uncertain about things, and that in fact, it's a built-in thing, it's part of our DNA, it's part of the instinct. Is that we want to know. Not only are humans curious, but cats are curious. It's a very famous line that curiosity will kill the cat. Well, our curiosity doesn't do us much good either. That I got to tell you this story because it was such an important thing. I don't think that Ajahn Po actually understood how deeply he affected me when he would just walk up random times in random places and just say, "Not sure." He didn't speak a lot of good English then. In fact, he's 93 now and he still doesn't speak English very well. And so he taught me with just a few phrases, not a lot of details. I give the details to the people because I don't have the kind of relationship the way that I did with Ajahn Po. But he'd just walk up to me and say, 'Not sure.' He would also sometimes walk up and use some Pali words. One of them he would use would be 'Tathagata.' 'Tathagata.' And these words are related. The word 'Tathagata' means 'to be here now,' to don't be concerned about other places and other times. Be here now is what he was saying. Be here now. That means don't be involved with those places out there through the media. Don't listen to about the wars. Don't listen to about the politics. Don't listen about how bad the cops are. Don't worry about how the Karens are doing. The thing to do is to start pushing that stuff away. Remember, when you turn your cell phone on and start watching the videos on YouTube, to go find something happy to watch. If you're going to watch something, go watch some comedy shows. Go watch something funny, something entertaining that's actually entertaining, rather than that which is supposedly entertaining, but winds up wanting to keep you attached and involved. They really want you to stay in there for some reason or another. The more clicks and the more likes they get, the happier they are to make you miserable. And so the much easier thing to do is to start planning in advance what media and what television, what newscasting that we're watching, and stop. Stop with the media. That would be like the monks out on Venerable Bodhisattva's and having to stop and listen to all the town gossip. No, they don't stop to listen to all the town gossip. They just continue along. So this is the most important quality that we can talk about this morning. Is the number one thing is to stay away from the media and invite all of your friends to stay away from the media. Well, all our friends are stuck in the media. We get stuck into the media because we're curious about what happens. We want to know. And the answer would be that nobody is going to get the future Nobody knows what's happening, that there is so much broadcasting. I mean, they have many, many, many different YouTube channels. One guy I know— in fact, I know I've seen several of them— that they will broadcast something every day just to keep their audience involved, and nothing much is happening today. And so what they will do is they will predict Because if this is happening yesterday, this will be happening tomorrow. And so they're out there spending your time talking about things that they really don't know, because nobody knows what the future is going to be. We just don't know what the future is going to be. So why are we listening to broadcasts of broadcasters who were predicting the future? Just go ahead, Anna.

**Speaker B:** Because nothing else to do. We don't know how to do anything. Only listen right now. We are obsessed about it, right? We're dependent on this. We're attached to it. Yes. People don't know what else to do.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the big point then is we can cover this is that We actually do this for entertainment. That's what we mean then, is about time structuring. What are we going to do with our time? And the answer to that would be, we need to plan wisely about how we're going to spend our time. And falling back to media is not a good plan. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually added something to what the Buddha taught. The Buddha taught about the Four Requisites in the sense of just enough food, just enough clothing, just enough housing, just enough medication, and he added another one, And the one that he added was entertainment. Now, Eric Byrne talks about that in the sense of time structuring. How are we going to structure our time? Because we have 24 hours a day, part of that's taken up with sleep, part of that's taken up with activities like eating and bathing and dressing and that kind of stuff. But we spend an awful lot of time in activities, work-related often. And so, the rest of the time is left kind of empty or void. How are we going to spend our time? Obviously, from the perspective of the teachings of the Buddha, let's make sure that we're spending that time in a wholesome way. And letting the entertainment, letting the videos run, is not a wise way of entertaining ourselves or spending our time, because it winds up giving us uncertainty, anxiety, and dealing with a lot of angry people on the internet. And so, we can plan wisely about how we're going to entertain ourselves? How are we going to structure our time? Can we find something really wholesome and valuable to spend our time? One of the ways to spend our time would be to do something, volunteer work, that would be useful and valuable and wholesome to some people. Rather than spending our time, wasting our time, not just wasting it, wasting it would be like it's dead even, but in fact, we spend our time in harming ourselves by watching the media, being involved with things that really have no effect upon us, other than the intention is to make us uptight, anxious. And so those news broadcasters that don't really have anything to talk about today will say, well, yeah, but tomorrow they're going to go into court. Oh, and this is going to happen in court, and that's going to happen in court. Or they haven't gotten the military equipment yet, but tomorrow they're going to get the military equipment, and then they're going to do this, and they're going to harm people like that. Etc., like this. And so this is one of the main reasons to stay away from media and find better ways of entertaining ourselves. So, what's the very best way of entertaining ourselves? Is to have wholesome thoughts, to start planning on wholesome thoughts. For instance, if we're worried about something, we can say to ourselves, "Well, my worry is not going to fix that problem. That in fact, it's really not a problem. The only reason I thought it was a problem was because the media told me it was a problem, or one of my friends saw it on media, they thought it was a problem, and now they're telling me it's a problem. And the reality is, is that there really is no problems. All of the problems are made up. A good example of that was the war in Ukraine that is affecting so many people, killing so many people, displacing so many people, causing so much money and so much politics, is because Putin wanted something. He wanted power. In fact, that's what the media wants. They compete with each other for who can get the most clicks. So we're actually out there in a power struggle. And we can recognize that the problem that Putin had wasn't a problem at all. He was much better off, in fact, before he started that war. He was much better off, but he wasn't satisfied. That's what happens with us. We often break things unintentionally, because we wanted to tinker with it to make it better. We had a problem with it. So begin to recognize that the problems that we have are almost always manufactured in the mind, that really there was no problem. The reality of the moment is that there is no problem right now. If we are uncertain about something, just shove it off and say, "Well, I don't know." Not sure. I don't need to know. I don't need to know the future. What I need to know is this: to gain the skills so that whatever happens in the future, I can handle that with the same attitude that I have right now, which is I don't know and I don't care. I don't know and I don't care. And so this is the way that we can deal with our friends and family and other people out there, is to start telling them, I don't know and I don't care, and you're uptight because you don't know and you care. And so because you care so much, you don't know, here you are worried, full of anxiety, full of uncertainty, when in fact there was no problem in the first place. So when you finally buy their arguments and start to worry yourself, the easy way is to see that and say, "Hey, wait a minute, I can make a change here. Just because I don't know, just because I'm uncertain, let me enjoy that. Let me say, because I don't know, I don't care." I don't know what's going on, and that's okay. Right now, everything is all right. Just we have to practice, because look how much time we spend trying to entertain ourselves and wind up being uptight, anxious, feeling bad because of that entertainment. That we buy into it. The people who were talking about it talk about it as if it were important, and we buy into that importance, where in fact it's not important. Not really, not right now. The war in Ukraine is not a problem for us on this call right now. Not a problem. But if we think about it, it becomes a problem. So let's remember to not think about the wars. If you're Jewish, don't think about the wars with Israel and the Muslims, with Gaza, or Egypt, or Syria. Those places are far away. Let's let them be far away in our mind also. So when you begin to let your mind wander off into another country, say, no, I'm going to stay here in this country. I'm not going to let the mind wander into all of those dangerous places out there. That in fact, if Putin had been able to do that, oh, I'm just not going to worry about Ukraine, that's another country. If he had told himself that over and over again, every time he thought about, "Let me invade the place," then he can say, "Never mind, everything right now is hunky-dory." He wouldn't have invaded. So things are cascading, is kind of like the cause and effect, or what dominoes fall. Go ahead, Anna.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Anagami] It wouldn't be Putin. People just want to worry. People find a way. People have the reason to worry. We have 3 of us, maybe not worry, but the rest, maybe 3 of us do not worry, but the rest of the world worries.

**Speaker A:** Right. The rest of the world is worried. They're uptight. They get into conflict.

**Speaker B:** We enter to the world and we see everybody worries. We cannot say don't mind them, don't mind and don't care. They're going to They will not listen to us.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the same thing is true with the friends that I have. They often don't listen to me. They call in, they watch the videos, and then they get stuck back into the old ways. And so this is quite common. This is part of the reason why the Dhamma is so rare and so precious. Is because there is so much media. There are so many people that are uptight, angry, confused, being uncertain, full of anxiety, full of anger, and it's easy for us to pick up on that. So the better thing to do is to stay away from it as best we can. And then number 2, stay away from it in our minds when we can stay away from it physically. Just get away from it. Stop thinking about other times and other places. I mean, I can see historians getting all upset about what happened in some war 2,000 years ago, and they want to know all the details, and they get really uptight and anxious. And then that professor of history walks into the classroom and he spreads his unhappiness and uptightness to the students in the class. Those students leave the classroom and go and talk to their friends and other students on campus, and the next thing you know, just because one college professor got uptight about something that happened 2,000 years ago, now the whole university is uptight. Why? Because we let other people affect us. We buy into what their problems are, and we buy into it when we're listening to them, and then we buy into it later when we think about it. And so this is the second point, is that when we start to think about something that makes us uptight, anxious, confused, uncertain, and that brings on the anxiety, we can say, wait a minute, That kind of thought is making me confused, uptight. Let me think about something else, some wholesome things. And one of the things that we can think of is, well, right now everything is okay. I would like everybody listening to this tape in the future and those who are on the call right now, I'm going to ask you a particular question. Is Putin right here, right now with you? Because I mention his name, some people will say, "Yeah, you mentioned him, and here he is, and why am I uptight and uncertain and confused?" And the answer to that is, Putin is only here because we brought him here in our mind. And we can invite Putin to leave, and to think about something else. And so I can mention another name: Donald Trump. Is Donald Trump right here right now? Is he in the room with you? Well, a lot of people will think about— they've never seen Donald Trump, or maybe they've seen him but he's not here now, and yet they're thinking about him. They're uncertain, they're uptight. Many of them are his good friends, they see our supporters, they see him in court, they're confused, angry, and uptight. Others who are against him and want him out of it, they see the court and they see the ups and downs in the court, and they get angry, confused, and uptight. So whether you like the guy or whether you hate the guy, in both cases we are angry, confused, uptight, uncertain, and all because of what we're thinking about. So we can change what we're thinking about. And we need to actually practice doing that, to practice thinking about something that's wholesome. Like right now, Donald Trump's not here! Yippee-ki-yay! Donald Trump is not here! Putin is not here! Netanyahu is not here! None of those people are here now, so why do we think about them? Why do we bring them in and then cause ourselves uptight worry anxiety? So whenever we start thinking about this or that politician, or this or that important person, Stop. Put them out of the mind. Say, "I don't have to deal with that person because he's really not here right now. I don't have to deal with the situation that's far away." Corey, almost all of your uncertainty and anxiety is because of something that is far away. Is far away, so let it be far away. Just let it go. Don't think about it. Be here now instead. Think about what's happening right here, right now, because right here, right now is pretty good. Almost all of our worries and anxieties are someplace else. So let's remember to stop thinking about the things that are far away, or things that are old, things that are planned off in the future, because nobody knows what the future is going to be. It doesn't exist. The past is gone. It really doesn't exist. Even the war in Ukraine does not exist. For most of the people in Thailand. It does exist for a few because they want it to exist, and so they get involved, they start watching the videos, they get uptight when in fact there's no reason to. So this is the way that we—.

**Speaker B:** How to get this attitude for those who— for whom it exists. I don't— I mean, worry doesn't have to be that big, but any tragedy in the family, or any— okay, the people who are in the war, how they can detach from the immediate danger?

**Speaker A:** Well, mostly they could recognize that there is no immediate danger. For instance, when someone comes into your office and is worried and uptight and anxious about something that's not in your office, You can mention to them, well, right now in this particular moment, here you are in the office and that danger is not here right now. Can you stop thinking about it right now?

**Speaker B:** It's gonna be here in 30 minutes. Well, the danger will come back in 30 minutes. How to keep this coolness for after the 30 minutes?

**Speaker A:** Well, we can keep saying, well, that's 30 minutes from now, I don't have to worry about it. Oh, well, that's 25 minutes from now, I don't have to worry about it. Oh, it's 10 minutes from now, I don't have to worry about it. Oh, here it is, and I don't have to worry about it. If I can practice not worrying about what's happening in the future, then whenever that thing that I was worried about comes into the present, We're now in the habit of not worrying about it, but we have to practice being not worried.

**Speaker B:** We build the habit from the easiest, like we just stepped in the habit.

**Speaker A:** That we can get. We can think about something that's going to happen. Let us say that we've got to go deal with Grandpa. We're going our way to visit Grandpa, and I'm thinking about Grandpa, and I don't like what he did here, and I didn't like what he did there. And I get all uptight and anxious about Grandpa before I even see him, so that when I do see him, I see him and I'm already uptight and anxious, and I'm going to feed that anxiety and anxiousness to him. I remember something that happened to me back in the 1970s, this particular event. I was at school, teaching school. I told my girlfriend that I would be there at a particular time. I had to go to Ann Arbor. I was in Detroit, and I had to go to Ann Arbor to see her, to meet her. And I got involved with some students, talking to them. The time passed. It was time for me to be at the meeting that I had set up. And on the way from Detroit to Ann Arbor, Oh, she's going to be upset. Oh, how am I going to handle her? Oh, she's going to be angry. Oh, blah blah blah, she should not be angry. And I started getting angry at her and uptight. And then when I get to her house, she was really happy to see me. Oh, I'm glad to see you. We're doing this, that, and the other thing. Why don't you come join us? And that struck me so hard right then and there that I had planned for a conflict. I was ready for a conflict, and there was no conflict. But I woke up because I was walking in there uptight, expecting a conflict, but she was not expecting a conflict. And so I had to make a change, and I did make a change. But I didn't have to have gotten angry and uptight because I didn't know how she was going to ask. Just because I was late, I thought that she would be uptight and angry at me. So I was manufacturing my own uptightness and anger back at her out of my own imagination. And so if we know that some danger is going to happen in 30 minutes, guess what? We don't know that it's going to be dangerous in 30 minutes. We don't know that.

**Speaker B:** Here we are, Svend. I found another anxiety triggers. If you have a pain in your body, so the anxiety comes from the pain. You're not really consciously built it. Anxiety coming from your stomach or from your, I don't know, pain in your leg. And it's very, for it is maybe not the pain, you know, you may not feel the pain, but anxiety coming because pain coming, right? The pain and anxiety coming, and you cannot really control it with the, okay, I will think positive. I can't. It's fixed.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point, is that the anxiety does not come with the pain. The anxiety comes with the thoughts of, oh, poor me, what will happen to me in the future? Because I have the pain now, I will have the pain in the future. I will have to worry about it. Okay, and guess what? Some pains are temporary and they go away. There's no reason to worry about it, there's no reason to be anxious. An example of that is a kid can break his arm and he can put it in a cast and he can have the attitude, "Oh, I'm going to let this hand and this arm heal." I'm going to not move it and I'm going to be okay. If we had that attitude. But most of the kids, they don't like that their arm is broken. They try to ignore that it's broken, then it winds up having a lot of pain. And then they get uptight, oh, my arm will never heal, oh, poor me, I can't do this and I can't do that because of the pain. And the answer really is 'Let's not think about the pain. Let's go spend our time entertaining ourselves and get our mind off of the pain. Let's go do something else. Let's make a change. Let's divert.' That when we get old, a lot of pains happen, and the answer to that is, 'Oh, poor me, this pain is going to kill me. Oh, I've got kidney 'Oh, I've got stomach problems.' And the answer to that is, 'The stomach's going to be okay. Let me be nourishing to it. Let me rest the stomach.' Rather than saying, 'Oh, the stomach is going to get worse and worse and worse,' we can have the attitude and the mental state of, 'Oh, it's nothing.' There's no problem here. Yeah, there's a little sensation, a little pain, but it'll go away. This is— you've obviously heard about psychosomatic, right? And that we only hear about it in really, really severe cases, and yet we can recognize that we can cure ourselves with our attitude. That instead of worrying about stomach pain, we can say it's going to be okay, there's no problem with it, I'm all right, let me deal with it happily, deal with it in a nourishing way. Maybe if it's necessary to take some medication, some antacid or something like that, we do that with the attitude of this is going to be all right, this is going to be okay. Now last month I hurt the knee and that it was difficult to walk. And I even— my family even got me a walker. But what I started to do was depend upon that, that walker. And sometimes I would have the thoughts, oh, this knee is not ever going to heal. I'm an old man. It's getting worse. And when I caught myself doing that, I said, no, this knee is going to heal. It will heal. I know it will. Let me work with it in order to heal it. And sometimes I would actually get up using the walker, take a few steps, and then pick the walker up and start walking without the walker, just carrying it around, saying, how is the leg? It's okay right now. How is the leg? It's okay right now. And pretty soon I didn't need the walker anymore. But I could have said, "Oh, poor me," and then because it hurt a lot at one time, every time it hurts just a little bit, I can say, "Oh, poor me, it's getting worse." But in fact, we can heal ourselves with our attitude. But we have to remember to change our attitude, because "Oh, poor me, it's getting worse" is the common way of doing it. That's the automatic way. And so this is why Anapanasati practice is so valuable, to practice having wholesome thoughts about whatever the pain is. Oh, the stomach is going to be all right. Oh, the knee is going to be okay. All those mosquito bites are going to go away. Right now I don't have to worry about it. Everything is going to be okay. I don't have to worry about it. So this is how we can begin to practice having wholesome thoughts. So if any pains come in, let's have wholesome nurturing thoughts about the pain. If somebody comes in angry, we can have wholesome thoughts about them. Oh, you're all right right now. There's no reason for you to be angry right now. You can deal with that later.

**Speaker B:** So it's the same thing if Anapanasati practice, it's about breathing, right? Breathing practice. And it's kind of interesting because it's breathing from different places. So it's the same thing, you're just kind of training the flexibility of your mind when you change the place for the breathing. Is it right, Bhante Mike? As I understand it, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes.

**Speaker B:** How you need to change the place of the breath, like when it's long, when it's short. Is it for flexibility or is it for some other reason?

**Speaker A:** Well, Anapanasati practice in the Anapanasati Sutta is actually a very complete practice. When we think about breathing, we almost always think about the body solely. But in a way, we can say that, yes, that's the foundation. That's the place to start. If we have the thought, "Oh, let me take a long, deep, relaxing breath," then that will help relax the breath, but it will also help relax the mind. And if we continue to have wholesome, relaxing breathing, then that will help us to have wholesome, relaxing feelings also. So it's not really the breathing itself, the breathing is just an anchor. That whatever breath that you're having is either unconscious or controlled. And if we take control of our breathing, then we're actually taking control of the mind, especially if we have the thought of, let me breathe to relax, let me relax. Having that thought about relaxing the mind Having the thoughts about relaxing the way we feel.

**Speaker B:** They say you're not supposed to be attached to the calmness. So you're really not supposed to be attached to— you need to become, but you're not supposed to be attached to the thought of let me become.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's one of the major misunderstandings about the teachings of the Buddha. That, and I think that that comes out of the Vajrayana, or let's say the Western mentality about the Tibetan, they use that word attachment a lot. All right, but not all attachment is unwholesome. There are many, many wholesome things that we can attach to. One of the things that we should be attached to, in fact, is being in the present moment. Attached to the present moment, as opposed to attached to what's happening way over there. Attaching to this present moment means, oh, I'm not going to be attached to the past, I'm not going to be attached to the future, I'm going to be attached to what's happening right here, right now. So there are some attachments that are very wholesome, wise attachments. Mostly what we're clinging to, what we're attached to, what we carry around are unwholesome things. So let us attach to wholesome things instead. This is the way that we can use it, is instead of being attached to being critical, that in fact the way that you started it, oh, you're supposed to not be attached. So that's become a rule. And the answer to that is, is that, oh, Well, I don't have to attach to rules, I can attach to what's happening right now. And right now I'm having a nice deep breath. Let's not make rules about it, let's be in the present moment that is free from rules. In fact, let's throw out all of the rules except for one. Let's have only one rule. And that one rule is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, the entire teachings of the Buddha. Let's start attaching to and having the rule that everything is okay right now, everything is fine right now. Let's remember to attach to that rather than attaching to problems, attaching to criticism. Let's start attaching to being nurturing. Oh, everything is all right, no worries, everything's fine. Let's start attaching to that, because that's wise. It's wise to attach to wholesome things, and it's unwise to attach to unwholesome things. And so let's start attaching to what's here now. And so when you have someone in your office, you can say, wow, let's not attach to any of that stuff. Let's attach to What's happening right now? How do you feel right now? Where did that feeling come from? Can you feel good right now? Can you take a deep breath and relax right now? This is the way that we want to start thinking about those rules, is that those rules make us uptight. An example of that is that Putin should not start that war. And so we hate him because we've got that rule. But a lot of people are actually on his side because they've got a different set of rules. And all we have to do is recognize that our rules often create our dissatisfaction. Our rules create our problems. And if we only had one rule, and that is no problems, let's attach to not having any problems, then that would be a really good rule. Let's not have trouble, let's not have problems, let's not have worries. Let's have uncertainties because we don't know the future, but let's be happy that we don't know, because if we don't know, that means that it's not affecting us right now. And so we begin to practice being in a good state. We practice and in fact become attached to being in a happy mood. Can you attach to being in a happy mood?

**Speaker B:** I can.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's start.

**Speaker B:** I already can. I am already blessed with the— be able to do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yes, let's attach to being in a happy state. Less attached to, "Oh, I don't know, everything is uncertain, and that means that I don't have anything to do." Wow! Let me attach to being free from all those worries, anxieties, and things to do, and just be happy and comfortable right here, right now. This is what we can be attached to, is the here-now. Of being attached to living in a paradise. Most of the people, in fact, in our society nowadays, on the world scene, are unhappy because they think that Planet Earth and human society is a hellhole. And they reattach to that. All things are so bad, there's a war here and a war there, and a political fight over here and those people are having trouble and all of this poverty and the rich people want more money and all of those terrible things. Let's not attach to that. Let's attach to right now. All of those rich people are not here. All of those warriors are not here. Wow, I don't have to deal with them right now. They're not here now. And so let's start attaching to the positive, that in fact we can start attaching to: we're in a paradise. This paradise has got no problems. All the problems that this paradise has are things that I invent in my own mind. And so we can attach to stop making problems and attach to Everything is all right, everything is fine. All of these people that are worried about this war or that war are just creating anxiety and worry. They're not fixing the war. They're not fixing the war. Your worries don't fix things. All they do is make us feel bad. So let's stop worrying about the past or about things out there someplace else, another country, and start recognizing that right here, this is a paradise. Let's attach to the fact that we live in a paradise. Right here there's no trouble. Right here there's no worries. Can we remember that? Can we make that a new rule and bring that up? Oh, I don't have to worry about what those people are doing. I don't have to worry about them being angry. I don't have to worry about them being uptight because right now they're not here. And so we can get ourselves into a really, really good mood because we got no problems, and then somebody comes up that's angry. If we can maintain our position, then we can soothe their anger. But if we're already uptight about the same things that they're uptight about, Now we're going to both be having an angry party. So when somebody comes up to you that's angry, remember that you don't have to be angry because you agree with them. You can instead have the rule of, oh, I'm not going to get angry because this guy's angry. That right here, right now, he's the one who's uptight, not me. I still live in a paradise. He thinks that this place is a hellhole, but I know otherwise. I know that it's okay. And so when someone comes into your office angry, you can say, "Wow, I can be happy right now. Why don't you be happy right now? What you're angry about is not in the office right now." You can begin to help people that way if you can maintain your own happiness and joy right here, right now. Then you can help them with that. But if you're uptight and angry about the same things that they're uptight and angry about, you're not going to help them. You're going to agree with them. You're going to help them justify their anger.

**Speaker B:** I'm not angry. I'm not uptight. I am great.

**Speaker A:** I'm OK. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** When they feel that I'm not angry with them, they get upset. I'm not empathic enough for them, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a choice.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm not. I feel to be angry.

**Speaker A:** So this is what happens is, is that if somebody wants you to get angry and you don't, they'll try harder. They'll make it worse, but they'll get over it. Okay, we always have to do that. Here's an example of that is a pimple or a pus pocket. It hurts. If we squeeze on it, it hurts more, but then it pops out and now it heals. So if you come to them, if they're full of pus and anger and you're not, they've hurt even more. They want you to be there. And when you can't be there, you overcome them. You say, hey, you don't have to be angry. I know that you're getting even more uptight and angry because I don't agree with you in an angry way. But now that you see that you're getting angry, why don't you make a change? Because whatever it is— so it takes a little while. You know that in fact it takes a while with you to start to getting what I'm saying to come in. But I keep coming back, and I keep coming back with my joy. You keep having your joy, and pretty soon it will overwhelm their anger. But if you get happy and joyful and they're angry, they're going to get more angry. And you can say, aha, I knew you were going to get more angry. Have you— how angry can you get right now? Because you've got a choice. You can get even more angry, or you can have a choice of letting it go. Because right now in this room, there is nothing to get angry about. There's no dangers here right now. And so this is the way that you can start talking to the people. But you have to talk to yourself about it first. You have to get into the mood of being happy and joyful. You have to talk yourself into it. You have to breathe your way into it. And then pretty soon it begins to stick. You begin to see there's nothing— there's no problems right now. There is no reason to be anxious or uptight. There's no reason to be fearful, to be scared, that you can in fact say right now there's no problem, there's no worries. That's something to really attach to. Attach to the breathing in the sense of taking a deep breath when we remember, I just relax, everything's all right, no problems, no worries. And you can do this if you remember. And so we have to practice remembering. This is where the value of the breathing comes in, is to remember to take a breathing, relaxed breath. Let's see you do it. Come on, Anna, take a nice deep Just relax and continue to practice that everything is all right. So let's take another deep breath. Everything is all right. And then we start to worry, and then we say, wait a minute, I don't have to worry. Let me take a deep breath and relax. And so we continue to remember Remember that we've got a choice. Remember that we can look at this stuff and say, "This is not worth having. This is Dukkha, this is unsatisfying." To be angry about Putin, to be angry about Israel, to be angry about the politicians, to be angry at this President or that Duke, is not beneficial. So let's remember to have wholesome thoughts. May that ex-President be happy. Let him be okay. The world right now would not have nearly the amount of trouble if we had pleasant thoughts about, "Oh, Donald Trump, just relax, just be happy." We can have thoughts about Putin and say, "Oh, Putin, just relax, just be happy." And so when someone comes into your office uptight about Putin or Trump or something, we can say, just relax, just be happy. Those guys are not here. They're not here.

**Speaker B:** People now coming with a picture of killed children. So it's not— it's a little bit more intense.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** More than some old dicks. But God bless them. And now it's a new entertainment.

**Speaker A:** So let's have wholesome thoughts because we can work ourselves up to doing something bad. That the mind is the forerunner. That somebody who is angry enough to go kill someone, he got angry at them because he kept thinking about it and thinking about it, and pretty soon he acts. And he probably started thinking about it because somebody else said, "Hey, you're so angry at that guy, why don't you go kill him? Why don't you do it?" And so we start thinking about it, and then we do it. And the right answer to that would be, let's not attach to what we see is wrong, the problems. Let's start attaching to that problem is not here right now. We're okay right now. Everything is fine right now. But we have to practice because otherwise those old thoughts will come back in. They've got power. So we have to have the strength to throw those thoughts out, to throw that anger out. Anger, in fact, is power. And when someone is afraid, They've been insulted, they want to fight so that they can regain their power. And the answer is, we don't need any power, it's okay to be weak. It's okay to just, "Not my problem." So we can attach to, "This is not my problem," instead of attaching to, "Oh, this is my problem." So whatever problems there are in the world, whatever causes people to be angry or uptight or upset or full of anxiety and uncertainty, we could just say, well, that's not my problem. And then when you practice well, you don't have any problems, but you keep throwing them back out and say, ah, I'm going to attach to Everything is okay, everything is fine, I'm satisfied with the way things are. And you keep practicing that way, Anna, and pretty soon everything's going to be okay. The only time that things are not okay is when you think that they're not okay. And so let's say, ah, I just had a thought that's not okay. Let me drop it right now. Let me come back to a state of homeostasis. Let's go back into a state of well-being. Everything is okay. Let me feel well, because right now there really are no problems. What a relief it is, no problems. What a relief it is, no worries. What a relief it is, got no place to go and nothing to do and everything is okay. And I can find wholesome ways to entertain myself And in fact, this is what we're doing right now. We're entertaining ourselves in a very wholesome way by saying all of that stuff out there, not my problem. Because my problems only make me uncertain, doubtful, uptight, anxious, fearful, and angry. But I don't solve the problems. So let me just stop having those problems. They're not a problem. Yeah, the world is angry right now. That's okay, not my problem. In fact, if we can spread our joy, then maybe the world will not be so angry. But we can't teach them anything that we don't know ourselves. We can't teach them anything we don't know, so let's make sure that we know that there are no problems.

**Speaker B:** I'm teaching myself to eat slowly. This is the only thing I'm not— I don't know how to do at all. Very wholesome practice to slow— to eat mindfully. Absolutely impossible. For us, it's very hard. So this is my next step of studying mindfulness, to study how to chew the food.

**Speaker A:** Yes, to eat slowly. Then, in fact, when the stomach hurts, that's a very good time to say, oh, let me relax. Let me not eat so fast. Let me not worry. We get in the habit of eating quickly because we've got to go someplace. We've got no place to go. Let's eat slowly. Let's enjoy the food. Every morsel is delicious.

**Speaker B:** But so I saw how hard it is, unbelievably hard to slow down the—.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's easy when we remember, and it's hard when we fuss at ourselves about not remembering. It's easy to do when we do remember, but if we fuss at ourselves, we're halfway finished the meal and we're saying, oh, I ate that so fast, oh, 'Oh, poor me,' and then we finish instead of saying, 'Oh, wait a minute, I've eaten half the meal so fast. Let me start slowing down right now.' It's not hard if we remember. It's hard when we fuss at ourselves about not remembering.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But it's actually easy. One bite at a time. Ah, that's so good. Oh, I can taste that. Oh, I can taste this. Oh, that's so good. Oh, I can taste that. Oh, well, the mouth is empty now. I'll have another bite.

**Speaker B:** I guess this is the oldest habit, even older than being anxious about news. It's just so, so ancient. It's very hard to Reduces speed. Very hard.

**Speaker A:** Actually, babies get into a bad habit with mom's breastfeeding. Cause mom gets tired of the baby breastfeeding, so they want to push the kid away. And because of that, the kid will say, oh, I got to get it quick because mom's going to push me away and suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck. And then all the tits gone. And we wind up living our whole lives like that. To where nobody's going to take the plate of food away from us now. Nobody's going to come and take your plate when you're not finished with it, so it's okay to eat slowly. But you're right, we pick up that bad habit of eating quickly when we're very young.

**Speaker B:** And all of us had anxious moms. Very rare when moms are not anxious.

**Speaker A:** Right, that the moms are anxious and so they're teaching this infant, not even just a few weeks old, and they're teaching that child to be anxious and uptight. Not only that, but when they're anxious and uptight when they're pregnant, they're teaching the child to feel anxious and uptight.

**Speaker B:** And now we need to relearn everything.

**Speaker A:** Back to the— all the way back to our wound. Exactly. To the wound. Okay. We have to change our behavior all the way back to the very first things that we learned. Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's not hard when we remember, but it's really hard when we fuss at ourselves about not remembering.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Anna, well, why don't we finish this now? This has been quite an interesting talk. I really enjoyed this. Thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** We finished very nicely, right? We went back to the To the belly.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Recognize that when you first called, you were in a different mood than you are now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** My joy has rubbed off on you, that you could not make me feel bad, and I can make you feel good because I've got that power, I've got that attachment. Attachment to joy. So we'll see you. Thank you for calling. See you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends including Anna (Speaker B), focuses on **how to deal with widespread societal anger, anxiety, and uncertainty by turning inward and cultivating personal peace.**

Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: External Chaos Creates Internal Turmoil**
*   Society is filled with anger, conflict, and worry (politics, wars, media). This external "noise" generates uncertainty and anxiety within us.
*   We unconsciously absorb and spread this negativity, getting "sucked into" dramas that are not our own.

### **Primary Solution: Skillful Withdrawal & Guarding the Senses**
1.  **Disconnect from the Media:** The most emphasized advice is to **stop consuming news and conflict-based media**. The speaker argues media sells anxiety ("if it bleeds, it leads") and we cannot solve these distant problems. Engaging only harms our mental state.
2.  **Stop Mental Engagement:** Do not let your mind dwell on faraway conflicts, past grievances, or future predictions. As Dhammarato's teacher, Ajahn Po, taught: **"Not sure"** is a valid and peaceful stance. We don't need to know or care about things outside our present moment.

### **The Practice: Cultivating "Here-Now" Paradise**
*   **"Be Here Now" (Tathagata):** The core practice is to continually return to the present. Right here, right now, there is no war, no political figure, no problem. We mentally create problems by leaving the present moment.
*   **Choose Wholesome Attachment:** Contrary to some Buddhist interpretations, the talk encourages **attaching to wholesome states**. Cling to the feeling that "right now, everything is okay." Attach to joy, relaxation, and the perception that you are in a paradise *in this moment*.
*   **Use the Breath (Anapanasati) as an Anchor:** Use conscious breathing to relax the body and mind, reinforcing the "here-now" feeling. It’s a tool to regain control and remember your peaceful baseline.
*   **Reframe Problems:** Physical pain or future dangers are amplified by the narrative we add ("poor me," "it will get worse"). Practice meeting sensations with a nurturing, "this will be okay" attitude. Build the habit of non-worry step by step.

### **Dealing with Others' Anger**
*   If you maintain your own peaceful, joyful state, you can be a calming influence for others. You can point out that what they're angry about isn't in the room *right now*.
*   If you join in their anger, you only justify and amplify it. They may initially be upset by your lack of "empathy" (i.e., joining their distress), but your steady joy can eventually soothe them.

### **Wholesome Entertainment & Time Structuring**
*   Since we have free time to fill, we must choose entertainment wisely. Consuming conflict is unwise entertainment.
*   Choose activities that are genuinely uplifting: comedy, volunteer work, or any activity that supports wholesome thoughts. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa added **"entertainment"** to the traditional four requisites of life, highlighting the need to manage it skillfully.

### **Ultimate Realization**
*   **"My problems only make me uncertain, doubtful, uptight, anxious, fearful, and angry. But I don't solve the problems. So let me just stop having those problems."**
*   The relief comes from realizing that in the present moment, there are truly no problems. The world's anger is "not my problem." By cultivating and spreading this inner peace, we contribute to healing in the only way we truly can.

The talk concludes with a practical example—eating mindfully—illustrating how even our oldest, most anxious habits can be rewired by gently remembering to return to a slow, present, and enjoyable moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about anxiety, media consumption, and mental training. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**
1.  **"If it bleeds, it leads"**: A common media metaphor used to explain how news outlets prioritize violent, conflict-driven stories to attract and retain audience attention, creating a cycle of anxiety.
2.  **News as Entertainment/Drama**: The media is compared to a dramatic play. People start watching for entertainment but become emotionally "sucked in" and identified with the "characters" (countries, politicians), leading to emotional ups and downs.
3.  **Anger/Anxiety as a Contagion or Pus**: Negative emotions are described as something that spreads subconsciously between people (like a contagion). Later, a person's pent-up anger is compared to a "pimple or a pus pocket"—squeezing it (engaging with it) hurts more at first, but releasing it allows healing.
4.  **The Mind as a Forerunner**: This Buddhist-inspired idea is used to explain that actions (even violence) begin with persistent thoughts. To prevent harmful actions, one must stop feeding the harmful thoughts.
5.  **"Living in a Paradise" vs. "Living in a Hellhole"**: A metaphorical choice. The speaker argues we can choose to see our immediate present moment as a problem-free "paradise" rather than adopting the worldview of a troubled "hellhole" presented by the media.
6.  **Dominoes/Cascading Effect**: Used to describe how cause and effect work, from one person's anxiety (e.g., a professor) spreading to many others, or how one thought can lead to a chain of negative events.

### **Stories/Anecdotes:**
1.  **The Teaching of Ajahn Po**: The speaker recounts how his teacher, Ajahn Po, would simply walk up to him and say, **"Not sure"** or **"Tathagata"** (meaning "thus gone" or "one who has arrived," emphasized here as "be here now"). This minimalist story illustrates the core teaching of embracing uncertainty and present-moment awareness.
2.  **The Late Arrival to Girlfriend's House**: The speaker tells a personal story from the 1970s. He was late to meet his girlfriend, spent the entire drive anxiously preparing for a conflict, and arrived to find her happy and welcoming. The story highlights how we **"manufacture"** anger and anxiety in our minds based on predictions of the future, which are often wrong.
3.  **Recovering from a Knee Injury**: The speaker shares how he used a walker after a knee injury but consciously practiced the attitude that "this knee is going to heal." He would test walking without it, reinforcing the belief in recovery. This story is used to demonstrate how **attitude and "wholesome thoughts"** can aid physical healing, contrasting with a "poor me" narrative that worsens suffering.
4.  **The Breastfeeding Baby**: In the discussion about eating slowly, Speaker B mentions the deep-seated habit of rushing. Speaker A extends this with a metaphorical story: a baby learns to suckle quickly because an anxious mother might push it away, instilling a lifelong habit of anxiety and hurry. This story traces the **root of anxiety** back to our earliest conditioning.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks (which function as extended metaphors):**
*   **Inside vs. Outside**: The problem is framed as having two arenas: the external world (which we can't control) and the internal world of the mind (which we can). The solution involves withdrawing from the chaotic "outside" (media) and managing the "inside."
*   **Time Structuring / Entertainment as a Requisite**: Borrowing from Eric Berne and Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, life is framed as managing time. "Entertainment" is a necessary life requisite, and we must choose wholesome ways to fill our time instead of letting toxic media fill it by default.

These metaphors and stories collectively build the talk's central argument: that much of our anxiety is **self-created and amplified by media consumption**, and that freedom comes from disengaging from external chaos, embracing present-moment awareness ("be here now"), and consciously cultivating wholesome thoughts and habits.
