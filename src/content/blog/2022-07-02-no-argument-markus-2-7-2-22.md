### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So Marcus, it's good to see you again. And you have a question about two people in a conversation, and neither of them feels like they're being heard, and neither of them is getting what they want. Can you name me a conversation where that doesn't happen? In fact, that's what an argument is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that is what it is. That happens all the time, right?

**Speaker A:** I guess that's it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So with a bit of skill, you can see it coming. And with a little less skill, but still skill, you can see when you're caught in it. And put a stop to it. That in fact, every argument, someone will eventually wake up and put a stop to it, otherwise there's going to be violence and death and bodies to dump in lakes and Anicca to invade and Star Wars and planets to blow up. I mean, generally there's no end to ignorance. Hopefully somebody's going to wake up soon. Sometime. And the sooner they wake up, the less damage they're doing. So I understand that in that regard, you want her to wake up really fast.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but like at the same time, I think another aspect is like, I mean, we touched on it a little bit actually last time, which is this thing that you know, she had some criticisms of me and I felt, you know, some of them were justified and some not. But an interesting thing is that like in response to— Feel attacked. There's a huge fear of attack. But yeah, the thing is like we were talking about, there's this automatic sense that I should feel bad, that I should feel guilty. And I'm really like noticing that. But then I'm thinking, well, It doesn't actually help me.

**Speaker A:** She probably didn't say that though, that's some old pattern that you've added to the mix. That when somebody criticizes you, you're supposed to feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, no, she didn't say it for sure. It's just like an automatic reaction in myself that I, as if I feel bad, that will somehow like fix anything for anyone.

**Speaker A:** That's absolutely not the case. It doesn't matter whether the criticism is correct or not, you automatically have a first reaction to it rather than being given a gift. You see it as an attack.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so if you could hear what she has to say as a gift, because she thinks she's doing you a favor. She's actually there to help you, and she's frustrated because you would rather get defensive and try to protect the self the way that it was. Yeah, but you're so true. She's just offering advice, and look, you're the one who is doing the attacking, and you're attacking yourself with that parent ego state of the rules and all, that is called Samskara. So with that, we can sort of recognize then why it is so valuable to practice Sati and to practice changing the mind out of unwholesomeness. Into wholesome, and to practice taking joy in doing that. Because when those arguments give themselves an opportunity to arise, you'll just jump right into that argument the way that you did years ago. Any argument will do. I'm willing to argue with anybody on any topic. And then I'll feel bad when they attack me. Yeah, so you've been there, done that, huh?

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, now that we're getting that kind of insight, is that you set yourself up, you make yourself a target. And then when the target gets hit, you squeal.

**Speaker B:** I can't argue with that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. So there are several ways that we can deal with that, and you could say that there are several ways we could deal with it based upon the skill level that you have, and that the higher the skills, the easier it is to deal with But in the beginning, there's some skills, and one of the skills that you can now pick up and take on is to be mindful or to be alert for these arguments, to know in advance when you're getting into it. How soon can you pick up on, oh, here we go again? And if you can do that joyfully, "Aha, I see you, here we go again, here to dance," then with that attitude, you can deal with the argument in a completely different way, if you know that you're waltzing into an argument. You see, you've been doing this ignorantly for a while. You've been wondering how it all got started. And so now you can sort of plan on seeing arguments 5 seconds ahead. One of the ways that you can tell always is when you change your voice, when you raise your voice, either in pitch or in volume. Either one is a sure indication this is hitting fat, this is getting heavy. And so the thing to do right then, shut up. And in fact, that's a good idea as a plan during those times when you want to let her have it, is time to refrain from letting her have it. Keep your mouth shut. You'd be surprised how short arguments are when only one person is arguing. And you can keep your mouth shut. And if you are, let us say, skillful, you can do that in the same mood, with the same attitude, and the same gestures that you have with me right now. Just sitting there and smiling and nodding your head. And feeling the same way inside that you do now, rather than the way that you normally feel when you're in an argument. So that's the question: can you do that? Can you see these arguments coming in, take a deep breath, oh, there it comes again, and now it's time to shut my mouth? Smile and nod. Yes, ma'am. What do you think will happen if you try that approach, or non-approach, as it.

**Speaker B:** Well, basically the argument cannot go on because it takes two people.

**Speaker A:** So if you can manage that on the outside, then the only next issue is that how do you feel about it on the inside when you're being criticized? Yeah, yeah, yeah, because you've been criticized before, probably many times, probably way too many times you've been criticized, right? Did you survive?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I did.

**Speaker A:** You survived every one of them, huh?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you're still breathing, you're still here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's remarkable.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** It's remarkable.

**Speaker A:** Yes. It's in fact remarkable when I point that out to students, that, "Hey, you did not cut yourself to death yet. Here you are, still alive, which means we're doing something right, because you're still alive." If you screwed up everything, you'd already have been screwed up enough to have it kill you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And like, if I look back at times when I was criticized, like, even if I didn't like it or still don't, in retrospect it has. You know, been of some benefit to making me, you know, consider things differently or just generally approaching situations in a better way.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that we are still alive, that we're still breathing, that this is where it comes in. That aren't you glad that you're still alive?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you would be glad that you're still alive even when someone is arguing with you criticizing you, right? You'd still rather be alive and criticized than dead and don't have to hear it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we've got some place to go with it then. So this is in fact back to Dukkha, where in the West a lot of people have been kind of talked into believing that life itself is suffering. That has exactly to do with Christianity's original sin, that we all are born in sin. Well, basically we're born into a civilization that's full of sin. So, in fact, it's more of that we are not born a pile of shit. We're born immediately covered in a pile of shit, and there's a difference. That is, is that life itself is not a pile of shit. We just kind of make it that way. Yeah, one of the ways that I say it is, is that you've probably heard this, that life sucks. Then you die. That's the bumper sticker for a while: life sucks, then you die. The point though is that life sucks when we are sucking. If we would stop sucking on things, then life wouldn't suck so much. And so the sucking in life is not the same thing. It's not that life that sucks, it's the sucker who's sucking. But probably there's no noun anywhere in there, and it's certainly not 'life' itself. So, when we say that life sucks, or that we're actually not looking at the fact that we want something that we don't have. It's like we're trying to take the life that we want and suck through a soda straw. I remember very much so, I got a Mercedes automobile through a soda straw, because I sucked on it that hard. But until I got that Mercedes, life sucked. But guess what? I didn't set that soda straw down. I should have been recognizing that, look how hard I suck. So when we recognize that it is our wanting and our clinging and wanting things to be different than they are, is often what creates the thing. That has been kind of in the magical realm, or in the witches' brew, or sayings that they have in Wiccan, is that you draw to yourself the things that you're afraid of. And there are many, many, many examples of that in nature. An example would be the postman who is afraid of the dog. He behaves afraid of the dog, the dog knows that he's afraid of him, and so the dog immediately starts barking at this guy. Here in Thailand, all the delivery guys ride motorbikes. And whenever the dogs are then barking at them, what do they do? They stop their motorbike. They can't figure out that their motorbike is faster than any dog. And all they have to do is just drive away, but they don't. They stall in fear of getting bitten, giving the dog an opportunity to bite them.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So these are a couple of physical examples of that. So when your fear of being criticized, you set yourself up for being criticized. You draw to it, you draw it to you. The things that you're afraid of, you become some kind of magical or magnet, or set things up intellectually, or whatever it is, and then we get criticism. Just questions like, "How am I doing?" expecting a good answer, and they actually answer the question how you're doing. The best thing, if you don't want to hear about it, is don't ask. Better thing to do is investigate the book. So if you ask her what you want in these argumentative situations, she's going to make sure you don't get it, just like you make sure that she does not get what she wants out of the argument. So you set each other up with this rule.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's how it works.

**Speaker A:** I've seen it happen many times, but I did not see it for myself the first time until it was pointed out to me almost on a regular basis by good teachers. Okay, so this is how arguments go, is that we invent the argument. So that's also the question: who starts the argument, you or her, or you don't know, or both, or neither one of you? Because each one were already in argument in your mind. Often the argument starts before anybody says anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I've definitely sometimes, you know, looked for reasons to be offended or upset.

**Speaker A:** All right, so now we have something to look for, to check these things. To see that those are unwholesome thoughts we have that set up unwholesome situations with the people that we care about. That is well known in many circles, that we hurt the ones we care about the most. Basically what that means is that we will behave behind closed doors in such outrageous ways that we I dare expose in public, that I from time to time would ask a woman, the way that she's treating her child, "If you treated a cop that way, what do you think that cop would do to you?" Give them pause to think that, yes, we behave badly when we think we can get away with it. That's true. You don't try it. Guess what? You're not getting away with it because you already know, and she knows too. Neither one of you are letting each other off with any of this.

**Speaker B:** Because.

**Speaker A:** Often the arguments are old arguments anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, like.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, there was a little problem, but it's fixed now. So basically, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, good. So yeah, there was like this one instance where recently where a person basically wrote to me like a long message detailing like certain things that she had been upset about that I have done like, you know, months ago. And I hadn't like, I hadn't really even noticed that those were so bothersome. But then I'm like, wow, okay. So like all this time this person had like this image of something I did, whereas I saw it completely differently.

**Speaker A:** Now, well, guess what? In an argument, old ammunition is the best ammunition. If it worked— if that ammunition worked one time, we'll bring it up and get you again with it. And so if she said it before, you can just say, oh, I've heard that before, and see where that goes.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, no, it was like Actually, there were some things that I hadn't heard before. So it was like maybe— So yeah, there's basically like two people. The person who— So yeah, like one person basically, I was under the impression that we were like on pretty good terms. But then yeah, then at some point they just told me like all the stuff that they've been upset about, which they didn't bring up back then. And that was a little bit surprising to me.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, it is actually possible. In fact, psychologists have a name for it. It's called pecking order. And it goes something like this: The big boss yells at one of the junior bosses. The junior boss goes and argues and yells at the employee. The employee's on the way out, kick the janitor. The janitor goes home and beats his wife. The wife beats the child, and the child kicks the dog. Yeah, I think I got all of them in there. All right, so that's what pecking order is. In other words, if we get upset but we don't think we can get away with retaliating against the one who made us upset. We'll go find somebody else and retaliate upon them. And we do that for convenience sake. So whoever's there is the one who gets it. So if you go home and there she is, let her have it. Or in her case, whatever happened in the day, when she gets home, she's going to let you have it.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, but sometimes it's also like just don't say anything and hold a grudge and paint this picture of the other person that's like completely, you know, distorted.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the other way, is what they call hanging on to it, holding on to it. And what we would in fact recognize is rehearsing. Rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it. When we've got it down pat, then we let them have it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's felt a little bit what that was like. But you know, I mean, I do, I've done it too. So I understand where it comes from, because you know.

**Speaker A:** So, in a way then, all we're talking about right now is Anapanasati. Yeah. To wake up and look at what we're doing and recognizing that we're rehearsing the trash and that we can throw all of that out and really be glad to be in the environment that we're in. So if you're in an environment with your friend, be very happy that you're with her. And if she starts slinging the mud, dodge. She can't hit you. Not with anything new. Anything that you do, she's already got old ammunition. It's better than anything you're doing now. When you recognize that old ammunition, you don't have to let it hit you. Sort of stand out of the way. Oh, that's not me. I've changed since then.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I think that's the problem. Like, I take somebody's words and start beating myself over the head with them, even if, like, you know, I've moved on and kind of, like, learned what I need to learn. But I'm, you know, there's still this habitual guilt.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is what Anapanasati really then is about, is to recognize that we get into those kind of patterns that you take what she says, mix a whole lot of stuff that your mommy told you when you probably were still in diapers about how to feel about what this girl says, this lady says. And so you've got that mixture of the Samskara and the criticism, and you rehearse it, rehearse it, rehearse it over and over and over again, making yourself feel bad with every cycle. The question is, can you wake up to those cycles? Do you see it? Because if you can see it, you say, I can change that. I do not have to go down that rabbit hole. Not right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, last time, like, I was rehearsing all that stuff. Yeah, I didn't stop, but at least I managed to, like, you know, keep breathing in a better way, which I think allowed me to like not get totally, you know, lost in the unwholesome thoughts, or at least it like lessened the impact somewhat. So that's, you know, better than not having that. I think it's like the breath is really important. Like once that gets gets out of.

**Speaker A:** Control.

**Speaker B:** Then, then it's just like, then there are like really, really bad feelings. It feels really hard to do anything about it if one is like not paying attention to the breathing and how that is interplaying with those thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Well, the easiest way to see that is by getting away from it. Getting alone, being in seclusion, and then practicing watching what the mind is doing, so that you can then change it, to keep changing it. This is a completely different method than what they would call concentration. Oh, you're supposed to take an object and hold that object, and hold that object, and hold that object, and hold that object. What that means is that you're just giving the hindrances a boundary to not cross, or keeping them at bay, almost as if they're going to build up. Instead of having one at a time coming, they come as a horde. As soon as you lose your object of concentration, then the mind will get really busy again. And so the better practice is to not try to fight to force the mind to do anything, but rather just keep track of what the mind is doing with the idea that you can change it by adding a little wholesomeness to it. That's the practice, is it so that beginning every thought then becomes a wholesome thought. An example of that is instead of when the argument starts, "Oh, here we go again," You can come up with the gladden that up, "Aha! I caught you! I see that!" And start adding some joy to the situation, brighten the mind, gladden the mind, change the way that we're thinking. And we can practice doing that when we're in solitude. In fact, we need to practice it when we're in solitude to be able to do it in public. But in the life that you have, you've got both time for silent moments of seclusion, as well as having to deal with it on a daily basis. So you're in and out, and in and out, and in and out. So that gives you actually two opportunities to practice. But the best practice is going to be when you're alone, so that you can get those Anagami thoughts and get them together. And then, when you're in public, even with another person, that's probably enough. And so, dealing with other people, the question is, can you get yourself into a really good state, and then share that with other people. But that's the real goal, is to become friends with yourself on the inside and then become friends with other people using the same methods and same techniques. All right, that's the cause and effect. But in fact, there are systems of thought like Metta meditation, but Metta meditation is kind of backwards. In fact, they even tell the students to say things like, may all beings be happy. Have you ever heard of that? May all beings be free from suffering.

**Speaker B:** I've done it as well sometimes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, guess what? When people are saying may all beings be happy, they're putting themselves in that group of unhappy too. Let's all become happy. And in fact, the possibility of having an on all or everybody is a concept. In fact, we can't make everybody happy. It is a fool's errand to begin with. A much better way of understanding Metta is that, in fact, the way to say it would be, "Wow, I wish everybody that was hearing what I had to say felt as good about it as I do." Okay, there's two things about that. One is, is that the everybody that's around is not every living creature, because every living creature is not my business. The only thing that is my business is that which is around. What's happening in, uh, Norfolk or in Cincinnati, none of my business. But who's around here? The dog's on the porch, the kid's in the house. They're my business. Here they are. And so I work with them to help them be happy in this moment. So that would be the spreading of the Metta. But if I don't have any joy, what kind of gift can I offer them? If my mind is full of argument, what gifts am I going to give them? So this is what we're practicing, is to get the mind clean. When you've got nothing to make it dirty, all you're cleaning up is old mess. And when you get really, really good at cleaning up all the old mess and get the mind spick and span, then you can handle it when somebody comes in and messes with it. Don't you know you can clean it up again? In fact, if you're sharp, you can clean it up faster than making a mess. And one of the ways of doing that is by moving it out of the way so whatever they're shooting at misses. That didn't hit your mind and make it a mess anyway. You didn't present yourself as a target, which goes back to the idea that that's not me. I don't behave the way that I did 30 years ago, so why should I break myself up for the things that I did 30 years ago that were god-awful terrible?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or maybe 3 days ago for that matter. Sometimes it's like, that clearly didn't work.

**Speaker A:** And we're changing a lot, aren't we? Every minute is a new minute.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** But the joy is, is that now we can see that what we could not see that 3 days ago— 3 days ago you could not see what a mess this was making. Now that you can see what a mess this is making, you would choose not to do it. So therefore you're not the same person.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think this view of like the continue, this view that like what we do defines who we will become in the future is also sort of like self-fulfilling and causes us to like do the same things again.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way that we practice, is to wake up, look at what we're doing, make an improvement, and congratulate ourselves. When we do that over and over and over again, and pretty soon that congratulations, you'll begin to recognize that, hey, you can do this. You can clean up your own mind. Every time you make a mess, you clean it right up. Every time you fall down, you can dust, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and boogie on down the road. And most of us, when we fall down, like when we criticize, we just lay there and wallow in, 'Poor me, she ought not said that.' And so we rehearse it, which means that we just stay dirty. But you can pick yourself up if you remember. You can take that and dust yourself off and then boogie on down the road.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think maybe also like there are certain, you know, mistakes that maybe I've made that, you know, I sometimes make again. But I think even then, like, maybe the good attitude to have is, well, I'm not that person right now. Like, I don't know about like in an undefined moment in the future, but I'm not that person right now. Right now I have a better perspective.

**Speaker A:** Right. If that same person is me that I did then, then there's reason for regret, remorse, and redoing it. That's the problem with forgiveness, is that if we get forgiven, that's just permission to go do it again. But if we distance ourselves from it, say, no, that's not me, that's not who I am, I don't do that now, I can see clearly that's not the right thing to do. That in fact, in Christian terms, we would say, "Go and sin no more. Go away from this stuff. Get out of here. Don't come back. Don't go back into that state again." But almost always within the Christian confessional, the priests want to extract something out of you. Because they know you're going to go back and do it again. That's what confessions and forgiveness is all about. But here we're going to say, all right, through wisdom I can recognize that I have been in these arguments. I'm going to stop doing them because they're unwholesome, they're unhealthy. I've got just the tools to do it. Tool number 1, a zipper. And draw it tight enough that it makes a smile. So that's the way that we begin to practice, is that we recognize it. Getting into arguments is not what I want to be, that's not who I am now. That'll give you the insight and the determination to take joy instead of the old defensive way that you were doing, with the argument.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Another thing I noticed— Go ahead, Anushmi.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, another thing I noticed is like the nature of apologists. There's like two things, like I guess the one thing is that maybe I apologize because I recognize I did something wrong and I don't want to do that, that I want, you know, to let the other person know that that was wrong and I'm sorry. But like the unwholesome way is that like I'm apologizing not to make them feel better, but because I want to make me feel better by like, you know, yeah, right. And that's, you know, I really have to look for that, you know, sometimes there's just this feeling of, well, okay, and now I felt this guilty for a while, maybe, you know, maybe they will allow me to feel good again, you know, that's really messed up.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and you can see that that's a messy way of doing it. Congratulations! This is what the whole show, this Dhamma, this Vipassana is all about. Is to see how we mess stuff up, so that we can see how to clean it up. Pretty soon, after you clean up this and that and the other mess, your life becomes comes shining toy to play with, shiny new toy. And so in a way, this Anapanasati of taking a deep breath, seeing what you're doing, changing your mind, changing your breathing, congratulating yourself for it. Recognize that you are safe and secure, comfortable and satisfied, and that we can do this. And that's touching many of the states of Anapanasati. We've covered quite a lot of the territory right there, which is basically dealing with the body, getting in touch with the body, breathing well, changing the way that we feel. But the only way that we can change the way that you feel is by changing the way that you're thinking. In fact, that's how we change the body first. The only reason that you can take a deep breath is because you think of taking a deep breath and then you take a deep breath. Your mind controls the body. Once we get that connection going, then you can use both of them to control the feelings in the sense that you can learn to feel the way that you want to feel. Feel rather than feeling the way that you have trained yourself to feel. We trained ourselves how to feel when we were too stupid, ignorant, to figure out that we could feel the way that we wanted to feel. We were children, and how did we feel? We thought the way that the adults around us were feeling. We used them as role models. So that's how one generation after another that original sin is passed down, but it's passed down not as inherent but as merely a coding. And when you take a really clean bath, you recognize that you are a clean slate, that you're— that all your arithmetic and homework was not already written on the born before you were born. You can choose what kind of thoughts and feelings you want to have, and that is what's liberating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm really noticing this because I've, you know, I've been so used to like the role of the victim where I would wake up in the morning and be like, 'Oh my God, I'm feeling so bad. Why am I feeling so bad?' But now, now when I'm in that state, I'm asking like, 'Well, well, how did I make this happen right now? And how can I make something better happen?' Because it's me, me who made me feel that way.

**Speaker A:** Well, um, an example would be waking up and feeling really tired. Oh, I don't want to get out of bed. Oh, I feel so tired, and then the thought, "Hey, I can get myself out of this by energizing. Let me take a few deep breaths and see if I feel better." And sure enough, we do. And pretty soon then, we think of some reason or another that work makes it worth getting out of bed for, now that we've got enough energy. Before, we felt so tired that we didn't see any reason to get up. But now that we've given ourselves some energy, perked ourselves up, we'll begin to think of, "Oh, there is that toy that I could go play with. Let me go check that thing out." And so meditation in the morning, just at the point of waking up in the morning, that's a really good time to practice. Before you get out of bed. Go for a mind sweep.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because sometimes there are like some kind of dreams that like bring up some kind of odd stuff, then that like tends to linger. Like, it's good to like clean that stuff up.

**Speaker A:** I once had a dream that was so vivid, and what it was is that somehow or another I had turned to an ancient Asian, like in India, hotel. But this hotel was not only rooms where people lived, but every nook and cranny was stuffed with old wreck motorcycles. And that I was in that building inspecting every BMW that I could find. Is this mine? And then somehow enough woke up to say, this is a dream, and that the motorcycle that you're looking for is gone, so is the dream. Okay, the waking up to the recognizing that the reality is that motorcycle is gone. Why am I still hoping and wanting that motorcycle? Motorcycle and look at the dream state of where that I'm looking. I'm actually looking for it where it actually is. It's junk. But the dream got really, really vivid for a while in the sense that I know many of the various motorcycles that I could dream up in my mind to check it out. No, that's not it. And I came up with quite a number of them on various floors, some of them hanging, others were all apart. It's just amazing what the mind would do in a few minutes of dreaming. And I had worked myself— oh, poor me, I can't find my motorcycle— until I woke up thinking, nice, that motorcycle is in that junkyard. Why is your mind in that junkyard? It's gone. So with that, we can do that. When you wake up in the morning, you can reflect upon the dreams that you've had, if you've had one that you remember, recognize right now I'm in reality and it feels so good to be awake, to be free from all of that. Another time to do it is when you go to sleep at night. Many people say, "Oh, I've got to go to sleep." And the answer is, why don't you just lay there in bed for a little bit and just enjoy how nice it is? Don't let it go, nothing to do, pull that cover up, you're so snuggly too, and just go to sleep in Anagami state, and then we won't have all of these violent dreams where's my damn bodhisattva?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been actually like doing it in bed for a while when I remember, because it's like, it's like, because there's always this sort of anxiety, like otherwise, like, well, how am I gonna fall asleep now? But like, that's obviously not gonna help. Instead, it's like, well, sleeping doesn't take an effort. It's just like I'm just being there, and if it happens, it happens, you know.

**Speaker A:** Arahant. Right, oh, how nice it is to not put even the pressure on myself that you've got to go to sleep. Just lay there and just enjoy the night. So that's actually the practice of wakefulness. Along with that goes the sleeping posture, to sleep on one side so that we can breathe really well. We sleep on our back, we close off the back part of the breathing, and if we sleep on our chest, it really is hard. It's possible to sleep so that you're kind of three-quarter, but you still leave a lot of room for the breathing. So sleeping on one side consciously. So if you wake up in the middle of the night, you can adjust your posture back into one side or the other. So no reason to to sleep on one side. In fact, there are physiological reasons it's slightly better to sleep on the left side than it is on the right side. And the reason for that is because the heart is doing all the work, is now low, close to the bed. And so you just kind of let it rest there, doing its little thumpy, thumpy thing. And just relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think the posture thing is also something they discovered with like COVID patients, that like if they were having these people like lay on their back, like the oxygen level in the blood got really low.

**Speaker A:** In the early days, they were killing a lot of people through bad medical practice. They had to learn that you don't put people in hospital beds, crank it up, almost force them to be on their back, and then put these machines on them to help them breathe. Because those ventilators, once you go on one, you're probably not going to come off of it. That's why they, you know, in the beginning of it, they wanted ventilators left, right, and center, anywhere we can get ventilators, until they recognize the ventilators were killing the patients. They're putting them on their side. Was much better than any posture but laying on their back. And that's why we— that's one of the major reasons, you know, they still don't have a cure for it. Why is it that now the death rate is so low? The death rate is really, really slow, low. I mean, now it's down to only, what, 1,000 a day or so, whereas it was 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 a day. A day for a long period of time, because of bad medical practices. Now they've got it down to where there's only about 1,000 people a day. That's the last I heard, that's probably several months old. But in any case, the death rate has really come down, because they're working with respiration therapy, rather than doing the old medical techniques that they had. With them. So that's another reason for you to start sleeping on your side, is good health. It's also good mental training to remember to come back and sleep on your side, which is very much like be here now. I mean, it's really hard to to actually remember to turn over and get on your side and then not do Anapanasati. It's almost immediately you start working with the breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the breathing feels really nice on the side, like there's just like the gravity is working in favor.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. So, so these are the opportunities that we can have throughout the day to get ourselves into a really, really nice state. So that's the way that we want to be able to approach somebody who wants to argue with us— be in a really good state. Well, Marcus, I think that we've pretty well handled this particular issue. Do you have any questions about it?

**Speaker B:** That issue? No, no, I'm good. I'll try out what I've learned.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Go enjoy your practice.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student (Speaker B, Marcus), focuses on **transforming conflict and self-criticism through mindful awareness and joy in practice**. Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: The Cycle of Argument & Self-Attack**
*   Arguments arise when two people feel unheard and become defensive. This is a common, unwholesome pattern.
*   The student identifies a deeper issue: when criticized, he feels an **automatic sense of guilt and badness**, as if feeling bad will "fix" the situation. Dhammarato points out this is an old, added pattern (a *samskara*)—the critic likely intends to help, but we perceive it as an attack.

### **The Practice: Mindful Intervention with Joy**
The solution is to develop skill in **seeing the pattern and changing our relationship to it** using *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing) and a change of attitude.

1.  **See It Coming:** Develop the skill to detect an argument 5 seconds before it escalates. A key signal is a change in your voice (pitch or volume).
2.  **Disengage the Pattern:** The immediate skillful action is to **stop talking, shut your mouth, and smile**. An argument cannot continue with only one participant. This creates space.
3.  **Change the Inner Response:** Instead of feeling attacked, practice seeing criticism as a **gift or useful feedback**. Recognize you have survived all past criticisms.
4.  **Gladden the Mind:** The crucial shift is to **approach the pattern with joy**. Think, *"Aha! I caught you! Here we go again!"* This turns a conflict into a successful moment of mindfulness.
5.  **Don't Be a Target:** Understand that we often "set ourselves up" for criticism out of fear. Learn to "dodge" old, recycled criticisms by realizing, *"That's not me anymore. I've changed."*

### **Deeper Insights & Broader Practice**
*   **Life Doesn't Suck, We Suck:** Suffering (*dukkha*) isn't life itself, but our **clinging and wanting things to be different**. The phrase "life sucks" is reframed: we are the "suckers" sucking on unsatisfied desires.
*   **Practice in Solitude:** To change habits in public, we must **practice in private**. Use solitary meditation to observe and clean up mental patterns (*"clean the mind"*), so you can recover quickly when challenged.
*   **Metta is an Outward Radiance:** Loving-kindness (*metta*) isn't about reciting phrases for "all beings." It's about **cultivating so much inner joy and cleanliness that it naturally radiates** to those immediately around you.
*   **Forgiveness vs. Wisdom:** Unlike confessional forgiveness (which can imply permission to repeat the error), the Dhamma approach is **wisdom**: seeing a past action as unwholesome, deciding not to do it again, and joyfully moving on (*"that's not who I am now"*).
*   **Integrate Practice into Daily Life:**
    *   **Upon Waking:** Clean up lingering dream states by rejoicing in being awake and present.
    *   **When Going to Sleep:** Let go of anxiety about sleeping; just rest joyfully in the comfort of bed.
    *   **Sleep Posture:** Sleeping on your side (especially the left) aids breathing and mindful awareness, supporting both physical and mental health.

### **Conclusion**
The entire talk emphasizes that the path is about **waking up to our unwholesome patterns, cleaning them up with a joyful and alert mind, and thus becoming a friend to ourselves and others.** The breath (*ānāpāna*) is the constant tool for anchoring awareness and changing our mental state. The goal is to reach a point where you can clean up a mental mess faster than you make one, leading to a life that shines.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (the teacher) to illustrate the points:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Soda Straw / "Life Sucks"**
    *   **Metaphor:** "Life sucks when we are sucking. If we would stop sucking on things, then life wouldn't suck so much... It's like we're trying to take the life that we want and suck through a soda straw."
    *   **Purpose:** To reframe suffering (Dukkha). It's not that life itself is inherently bad, but that our **craving and clinging** (the act of "sucking") creates the experience of dissatisfaction.

2.  **The Target**
    *   **Metaphor:** "You set yourself up, you make yourself a target. And then when the target gets hit, you squeal."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how our own defensive patterns and self-criticism (Samskara) invite and amplify criticism from others.

3.  **The Waltz / Dance**
    *   **Metaphor:** Seeing an argument coming and thinking, "Aha, I see you, here we go again, here to dance."
    *   **Purpose:** To encourage a detached, observant, and even playful attitude toward habitual argumentative patterns, rather than an automatic, reactive one.

4.  **Old Ammunition**
    *   **Metaphor:** In arguments, people use "old ammunition." "If that ammunition worked one time, we'll bring it up and get you again with it."
    *   **Purpose:** To highlight how arguments recycle old grievances. The skillful response is to "stand out of the way" or "dodge" because "that's not me now."

5.  **Cleaning the Mind / A Spick and Span House**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a space that gets dirty. Practice is "cleaning up all the old mess and get[ting] the mind spick and span." Then, when someone "messes with it," you can clean it up faster than they can make a mess.
    *   **Purpose:** To frame meditation (Anapanasati) as an active, cleansing process of cultivating wholesome thoughts, not just passive concentration.

6.  **Dusting Yourself Off**
    *   **Metaphor:** "Every time you fall down, you can dust, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and boogie on down the road."
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast a resilient practice (quickly recovering from a negative state) with unskillful wallowing in self-pity and rumination ("rehearsing").

7.  **The Zipper**
    *   **Metaphor:** "Tool number 1, a zipper." (Referring to keeping your mouth shut during a brewing argument).
    *   **Purpose:** A simple, memorable image for the practice of mindful silence to de-escalate conflict.

8.  **The Clean Slate vs. Original Sin**
    *   **Metaphor:** Contrasting being "born covered in a pile of shit" (conditioned by a flawed society) with being a "clean slate." We are not inherently sinful or flawed; we inherit "coding" but can rewrite it.
    *   **Purpose:** To separate the Buddhist view of changeable mental habits from the Christian concept of inherent sin, emphasizing agency and liberation.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Postman/Delivery Guy and the Dog**
    *   **Story:** A postman afraid of a dog acts fearfully, provoking the dog to bark. In Thailand, delivery guys on motorbikes stop when dogs bark, forgetting they could just drive away, thus giving the dog a chance to bite.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how **fear magnetizes what we fear**. Our reactive behavior (stopping, stalling) creates the very situation we want to avoid.

2.  **The Pecking Order**
    *   **Story:** "The big boss yells at the junior boss, who yells at the employee, who kicks the janitor, who goes home and beats his wife, who beats the child, who kicks the dog."
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how we often **displace and redirect** upset feelings onto safer, more convenient targets (like a partner at home), rather than dealing with the source or our own reaction.

3.  **The Mercedes and the Soda Straw**
    *   **Story:** Speaker A recalls "sucking" so hard through the "soda straw" of craving to get a Mercedes automobile that "until I got that Mercedes, life sucked."
    *   **Purpose:** A personal example to make the abstract "soda straw" metaphor concrete, showing how craving for a specific object creates suffering.

4.  **The Motorcycle Dream**
    *   **Story:** Speaker A had a vivid dream of searching through a junkyard hotel for a lost BMW motorcycle. He woke up realizing both the motorcycle and the dream were gone, asking, "Why is your mind in that junkyard?"
    *   **Purpose:** To show how **clinging to the past** (lost possessions, old identities) persists even in dreams, and that waking up (to mindfulness/insight) means recognizing the present reality and letting the "junk" go.

5.  **COVID Patients and Sleeping Posture**
    *   **Story:** Reference to how early COVID treatment forced patients onto their backs with ventilators, which was harmful. Later, putting them on their side (better for breathing) improved outcomes.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a modern, scientific justification for the recommended meditation sleep posture (on the left side), linking physical health directly to mindful breathing practice.

### **Overall Purpose:**
These metaphors and stories serve to translate abstract Buddhist concepts (Anapanasati, Samskara, Dukkha) into tangible, relatable, and often humorous images. They make the instructions for mental training (**observe patterns, don't react, cleanse the mind, cultivate joy**) concrete and memorable for the student.
