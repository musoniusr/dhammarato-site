### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, here we are.

**Speaker B:** So have you joined one of these group calls before, Jeff?

**Speaker A:** I joined the US Sangha the other day, but my video didn't work at the time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's a shame.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think Parker, that's your name, right? Parker, you just came on?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Parker.

**Speaker A:** Parker's here. Jeff, I was having trouble with video last time. Nice to see you.

**Speaker C:** Nice to see you too. Good to meet you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good to meet you. Be well.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you too.

**Speaker B:** How are you, Parker?

**Speaker C:** I'm doing well. How are you, Dan?

**Speaker B:** Good, really well. Good to see you again.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, likewise.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you again representing the shirt-off crew. You're flying solo this evening. I told Dhammarato he could stay in bed. Yeah, so he's gonna do that. But good to see we've still got some shoulders. Good day so far? Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah, great day, nice and chilled, nice and we're just getting started here.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, in the US.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, oh, I see, right, morning in the US.

**Speaker C:** Um, noon is when the call starts. Okay, spot on noon.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great, great. What are you doing with your days right now? Are you doing the work from home

**Speaker C:** thing or Yeah, work from home. There isn't much work to do, but a little bit work from home.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sounds perfect.

**Speaker C:** Is that your situation?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm actually back teaching drums now. I was doing more drum teaching work than I had ever done before the pandemic kicked off, and then I was told to go home. I'd actually acquired a new teaching space with a friend right before everything kicked off. We painted the walls, we mounted a ton of stuff, photos of our favorite drummers, drum skins signed by our favorite drummers. It was all looking slick. We got new rugs on the carpet, two drum kits set up. We taught in there for one week and then we had to go home for three months. Wow. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Are you back in there?

**Speaker B:** I'm back in there. Yeah, I have been for a few months now actually. So the way that the restrictions came off here in the UK was they came off slowly. And so I was able to do kids first. The government here decided that kids would take priority, so I had some younger students in for lessons first of all, and then they opened it up to the adults as well. So all in all, I've been back there a few months now. When everything started, I didn't know if drum teacher was going to be a job anymore. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah, I was on everyone's case with, "Hey, I'm doing online lessons and come see me on Skype." And I had about 50% of my work come through. But then following, I'm now really pleased to see I've got tons of newcomers coming through. Everyone still wants drum lessons.

**Speaker C:** Great.

**Speaker B:** It's always tentative, you know, it's very much an extracurricular. Thing, drum lessons.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so, uh, like, that's the first thing you drop if you're running low on time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, or money, or both, or money.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, definitely, right?

**Speaker B:** But, um, yeah, I'm pretty fortunate. I've got a good bunch and, uh, and more incoming, so very pleased. Oh, great, very pleased. What's your work?

**Speaker C:** Um, I do video editing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so lots of screen time.

**Speaker C:** Lots of screen time, but it's nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great. On your own account?

**Speaker C:** Not like film stuff, more like producing stuff for social media.

**Speaker B:** Great. Yeah, great. Well, yeah, I see more and more really slick videos going out on social media now, and I'm thinking, this guy's got an editor. You can kind of tell, right? Yeah, you can certainly tell, right? How's everyone else's week been?

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Fine.

**Speaker A:** Mine's been really good. I started tuning into Dhammarato a few months ago because I was really struggling with my practice, and then I've kind of altered my practice a little bit, you know, increasing the gladdening of the mind and getting into a happy state before practicing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's, it's phenomenally changed my practice. Like, I owe that man and the Buddha, uh, a Christmas card the rest of my life. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** How wonderful. How's that for a bit of kind of multi-faith?

**Speaker A:** There you go.

**Speaker B:** Give the Buddha a Christmas card. Yeah, yeah. Uh, Dhammarato actually caught up with me and told me following our previous group conversation here, we were, uh, we were gushing a little bit last week, Jeff, if you'd been here. We were, uh, all feeling gratitude toward Dhammarato, and he told me it's misdirected. He said the gratitude really ought to go toward Achan Po. Achan Po is the, the current abbot at Wat Soamok. I don't know how much you guys know.

**Speaker A:** That's like something Dhammarato would say.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, yes, yes, yes, pass it on, pay it forward kind of thing. He was telling me again how it was Anagami Po who said that Dhammarato needs to share what they were talking about in the monastery here on Skype.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** He kind of enabled that. He was the guy who gave Dhammarato the green light. So, um, yeah, I'm, I'm still good. Uh, sorry, Christopher, does he still visit? I think he does see him every now and then. Yeah, I think he— I think the office where Dhammarato has to take care of his visa is on Koh Samui, and Ajahn Poh spends a lot of time on Koh Samui, so I'm told. Um, and so I think, I think they, they will catch up. I don't know, twice, three times a year maybe.

**Speaker A:** I'm not clear on, um, like, Dhammarato is no longer a monastic, correct? But is he still at a monastery? I'm not clear on that.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so he's, he's a layperson who just has his own property on the island?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Ah, very good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, really good. Yeah, he, he's there in jungle paradise Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Thailand's a beautiful place.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, you've been?

**Speaker A:** People are beautiful. Yeah, I've been a few times. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, uh, the Thai people are, um, uh, I guess from my perspective, you know, it's become more Western. And, um, you know, a lot of the people, they've turned, they've turned Buddhism into a religion in Thailand, but their hearts still have that teaching there. You know, there's so many gentle, beautiful people in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's really interesting to look at, isn't it, how where the fabric of the culture is Buddhism as opposed to the Judeo-Christian stuff. There is just a difference, isn't there? There's the— Dhammarato was telling me an awful lot about the Thai people before I visited and how their understanding of how happiness works is just different from the get-go.

**Speaker A:** They don't have the critical nature of the Western mind, which causes, in my opinion, causes us so much problems in meditation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that flip to gladdening the mind that you mentioned, Jeff, was Exactly. That was the pinpoint thing that I got from Dhammarato as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he opened the door to me. Absolutely. I was banging my head against the wall for 10 years.

**Speaker B:** Wow, 10 years.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm a slow learner.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe, but we're kind of sold a dud, you know, in that we just go about meditation in the way that we go about everything else, right? Which is to tell ourselves off. When we do a bad job.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, I certainly— I think I have some development, but there was, there was so much more there at the offer. And this is, this is let me see the light, so to speak, you know.

**Speaker B:** Amazing.

**Speaker A:** That's beautiful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And we hear pretty consistently exactly that, you know. Everyone who's in these, these groups is had that experience, that that tweak

**Speaker D:** is

**Speaker B:** the key that unlocks the whole thing, right?

**Speaker D:** Oh, Parker's smiling.

**Speaker A:** Please tell me if I talk too much, Dan.

**Speaker B:** No, you carry on.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, no, because I— that's why we're here. You're sort of running the show here, and I don't want to interfere with what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Hey, I have no agenda.

**Speaker A:** Very good, very good.

**Speaker B:** I'm just calling on behalf of Dhammarato to bring us all together, and we get a chance to chat and be grateful and smile. And beautiful. Yeah, we spoke a lot last week, didn't we guys, about the importance of Sangha and how great it is for us to have the opportunity to connect. We will often get funny looks if we start talking about this stuff to folks who aren't interested. And so It's important to be able to connect with some folks who are kind of going through the same experience, right?

**Speaker A:** You know, I met a lady, this really nice lady at the— I go to this garden near my house here in Montreal, near my condo, and I go there to meditate. And this lady shows up and she comes in and I'm just sitting there quietly and she's going to read a book. And she said, oh, I come here to read. I think it's very nice in the garden. It's beautiful here. And it's like, oh, it's a beautiful space. And I said, I come here to meditate. And she said, oh, you meditate? And then she was telling me how she'd been really struggling with mental issues, depression issues many years ago, and started meditating and was just recently thinking about starting again. She quit because, as she put it, it didn't work.

**Speaker C:** For her.

**Speaker A:** I didn't say, you know, well, no, it'll work. I mean, I didn't think that was appropriate. But it's just like, okay, you know, that's where you are right now, right? So okay, it's your struggle. So then she really started, we started having this very deep conversation about meditation and, right, and what has helped me. Yeah, I think I've kind of turned her on to Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Amazing. Amazing.

**Speaker A:** So you might see her on one of these calls one of these days.

**Speaker B:** Love it.

**Speaker C:** Love it.

**Speaker B:** And so it spreads.

**Speaker A:** It spreads. Yes, it does. It spreads like a beautiful virus. Yes, we all want to be infected.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** I don't want to be the bad guy, but I'm scared to like put, put that anything up there on my thing because I don't want like 200 people starting to dial them and then I can never get through.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good point. I better keep this a secret. This is now officially a— I've done

**Speaker E:** things like that, recommendations, and next thing you know, I remember I recommended a book one time and a friend of mine tried to order the book and he had to call like a used bookseller and the used bookseller said, well, what is going on? Because I've got 45 calls this week for that book. So I just remember that one experience. I don't want to have that happen again.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, to a secret society, we could create a handshake or something, a secret handshake or something.

**Speaker E:** Well, I guess I'd be like, you could call anytime except for, uh, 10 PM Eastern Standard Time on Thursday, because that's when I call.

**Speaker B:** Well, I suspect before too long, Christopher, you'll feel that you don't, uh, need the calls anymore, and then you can start making the recommendations.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, well, I like talking to him anyway. I like talking to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just great to hang out, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** That's when you know you have a good, you know, somebody good to talk to, because anytime you talk to them, that kind of lights you up a little bit, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker E:** I mean, his ability to bring his mind back exactly where it should be is amazing.

**Speaker B:** So isn't it?

**Speaker E:** Excuse me, guys, one second.

**Speaker B:** Sure, no problem. Yes, we are fortunate. And that's a wonderful story, Jeff. I just love just a casual comment just dropped in there that opens up a whole realm of possibility.

**Speaker A:** I make it a point. I had a teacher once, and maybe this is true in the whole Dharma and Buddhism, but he said never talk to people directly about Buddhism, unless it comes up in sort of an indirect way, or they start talking about it, because you never want to even subtly indicate that you're trying to put something on someone. Because in this Christian society, you got so many Christian people that are just sort of 'You gotta do this or you're going to hell, buddy,' you know. So it just turns people off. So, and it's— he considered it to be an unwholesome act to really to talk to other people who aren't coming to you willingly, right, you know, about Buddhism and the practice. But I don't know what Dhammarato's take is on that, or what your take is on it.

**Speaker B:** Well, I, I'm wrong. Yeah, I would encourage anyone to handle it the way you did, Jeff, to, to just make it very casual, you know, and, and kind of— I, I sense that you kind of tried to read this, this woman and her level of interest. And, uh, you know, you, you can just drop the M-word, meditation, and see what the response is like.

**Speaker A:** And that's what I did, and that was just kind of a— I was just being honest, right? I come here to meditate. Yeah, you know, I wasn't going to tell her I come here to, you know, look at girls, right? Yeah, that's what they do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And that's not proselytizing, right? You're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat. And, um, yeah, I imagine Dhammarato would, would, uh, feel the same about that, that, that, yeah, we, we want to be open, right? Yeah, we want to be able to— yeah, we want to be able to be honest when someone asks us what we're up to.

**Speaker A:** She was funny. She was kind of cute. I'm not a— I'm very much with Dhammarato in that, you know, the idea of, you know, anything magical or even the Devas and so on is, eh, I don't know. Like, it's possible, but I'm really— why bother with it? Yeah, why bother, right? So she was saying to me, you know, I think something's brought us together, you know. So there's something magic, some magical thing that has brought us together today. Because I've been thinking about it, and she said she'd been looking at Eckhart Tolle on video, right? I said, well, you know, that's like Eckhart Tolle, he's interesting.

**Speaker B:** Oh, we've lost you, Jeff.

**Speaker A:** I just thought it was kind of cute.

**Speaker B:** We lost about 10 seconds of that, Jeff.

**Speaker A:** Oh, sorry.

**Speaker C:** No problem.

**Speaker A:** I just sort of smiled at that. I said, oh well, you never know.

**Speaker C:** Part of it, there's Dhammarato talks about before Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, or before the Noble Dharma was shared freely, that you had to be in the right place, asking the right person at the right time, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker C:** Because it was somewhat dangerous to share the Noble Dharma among a bunch of people who believed in things that might conflict with that.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** So part of that too is one might talk to someone but not be ready to ask the right question at the right time. So her experience, there is a bit of synchronicity, but there's also, she might have talked to people that are into meditation before, but they might have mentioned that she might not have been quick enough to actually like look at that and show interest in it. So there's a little bit of, yeah. Like kind of build up there. Maybe you're paying attention more, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So we could point to serendipity, right? But also then it is often, isn't it, that someone will experience the kind of feeling that you touched upon, Christopher, of just like, hey, this is great, and decide that that's something magical.

**Speaker C:** Exactly, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Where— no, that's, that's, that's just what the brain and, and the body does when there's good conversation happening and people are agreeing.

**Speaker E:** And well, it is in a way magical. I think magical just got took into the fantasy world, but it is magic, right? It's just not magic in a supernatural way, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's a completely different way. Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, Christopher, maybe you're sort of saying in a feeling kind of way maybe that it's magical.

**Speaker E:** I don't know, I kind of look

**Speaker A:** at a lot of things in the

**Speaker E:** world as magical, but not in magic like, you know, fairy wand kind of magic. It's just, you know, this is a wonderful thing. It's amazing. Yeah, I don't even know how it happens, but it's really cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that was a big turning point for me with regard to the whole magic thing was to turn around and start looking at how complex and fascinating really mundane stuff actually is. For example, the conversation. I mean, there's, you know, how deep do you want to go with what's going on in each individual's mind? All the chemicals in the brain, the sensory data that's coming in and going out, and all of it is mind-blowing, right? That's not good enough. I want some magic, right?

**Speaker E:** Well, I think our brains kind of work that way because I mean, I have young kids and we read a lot of old fairy tales like German and, you know, all the Norse stuff and, you know, Greek. We go through all of them and these things, you know, are conveying a lot of information in the story, you know. I mean, it's like there's a lot of, there's a lot of truth, but not in the literal sense, you know. There's a lot there. So I mean, a lot of these things can be conveyed. I kind of get that at it when I read, like, I don't read a lot of Buddhist texts. I kind of get everything from Dhammarato because I don't know how I came across

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker E:** I'm just starting to learn about Buddhist, Buddhist stuff now, but I'm reading some of the things and I get that same kind of feeling, like these are illustrative stories. Like, yeah, even magic stories, like they're sort of conveying something that's literal but in a more imaginative way, right?

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Kind of like allegory, parable.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** Right. And, and as I understand it now, my knowledge of Christianity, Judeo-Christian stuff, the Bible, is very limited. But when I look at the Bible, I kind of I think the same thing was going on, right? Stories were being told to make a point, and then it got bastardized and bastardized again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I agree with them.

**Speaker E:** Well, the whole Catholic religion is based on that, because basically they put sort of a pseudo-Roman religion on top of a Jewish religion, right? In order to make that work, you have to go ahead and be super creative. And so they go ahead and translate all the Old Testament stuff to the New Testament to make it work. And, you know, it takes a lot of creativity. And, you know, it's a— it really, if you look at it closely, it's kind of amazing the system they put together.

**Speaker A:** It really is.

**Speaker B:** It's like, it's— well, wasn't it effective, huh? Wasn't it effective?

**Speaker E:** Oh, sure, sure. I mean, if you have an emperor deciding to take on a religion, I mean, that helps too.

**Speaker A:** But yeah.

**Speaker E:** That doesn't hurt. That doesn't hurt at all.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, yeah, yeah. So the effect was kind of already there waiting to happen.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like, I've always found it kind

**Speaker D:** of

**Speaker A:** strange that, you know, people would look at like older Buddhist texts that were, you know, 500, 600, 700 years after the Buddha and think that, you know, this is the pure transmission. Like You know, you just play, you know, when you're a kid, you play telephone, right? You know, the game telephone, you go around the circle. Like, how on earth after 600, 700 years with the change in culture, change in location, you know, all the intertwining of different people and different perspectives on things, how on earth can that be like, you know, pure transmission? Like, you know, even, even, you know, the original text, we don't— like, we don't even really know. I mean, technically, we don't even know Buddha existed.

**Speaker B:** I think there's some pretty solid Indian historical stuff, as I understand it,

**Speaker C:** because,

**Speaker B:** because the Buddha was royalty, of course, right? So, right, um, as I hear, you know, and this is only hearsay, but as I, as I hear it, there's there's some pretty solid stuff that points to that the Buddha was a real dude. But this is one of the tremendously valuable things that I find in speaking with Dhammarato. We keep riffing on this. Is that if I pull up a sutta, it could be full of magical nonsense. And I've got no idea how to make sense of that. Yes, Dhammarato will say, oh yeah, MN whatever, and then point to a bunch of other suttas, right? And drop a context bomb, and now we've got something that makes sense. Yeah, right. And as I understand it, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa made a long, long study of the Pali canon, and that was one of his tremendous strengths, was contextualizing these isolated texts, you know. And how, how could, how could you do that unless you go and read that stuff, you know? And of course, we have to deal with translations. Well, for sure, because Buddhadasa went ahead and just read it all in Pali.

**Speaker A:** So I had a, I had a Buddhist teaching discussion for a while. He was a monk, uh, from Thailand that was an expert in the Pali. He could read the Pali. Unfortunately, I don't know, me and perhaps for him, he was a dry Vipassana fellow, right? So which got me into a lot of problems.

**Speaker B:** Oh dear.

**Speaker A:** Destabilized me.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, wow. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Much of my anxiety came from that. I just freaked out. I think I was starting to see the some of the, uh, the aspects of no-self. Yeah, yeah, kind of. I wasn't stable enough to handle it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, I'm always fascinated by, uh, that, uh, traditional package deal of Samatha and Vipassana. Yeah, right, that, that you'd use Anapanasati to stabilize, and then you can start to, to take a good look.

**Speaker D:** And Samatha and Vipassana are the same those people, the dry Vipassana, I think it's wrong practice. Anicca doesn't lead to anywhere. I don't think that it leads to anywhere.

**Speaker A:** I would say at the very least, for me, it did not work. For some people, you know, maybe it works. So whether it's right or wrong practice, I don't know.

**Speaker C:** For me, it was—

**Speaker D:** I don't think it works because What's the drive? It adds to the anxiety because it's mind movement, like you want to notice things, but it doesn't lead to the tranquility of letting go, gladdening the mind. It's a result. The gladdening of the mind is a result of the right Vipassana. When you do the right mindfulness and you let go, your mind becomes more tranquil and you can do more, like more detailed or more advanced mindfulness on the smaller detail. So it's a practice that leads more inwards, more to smaller things. But the drive, Vipassana, like you cannot handle it. You cannot go more inwards. Just stay on the surface.

**Speaker B:** Just sense.

**Speaker A:** That's been my experience. I would agree with what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it can be dangerous. Right, it can lead to things like anxiety because, yeah, we don't have that stability and we start to see through certain things, things breaking down and, yeah, uh, experience changing. That which we thought was solid suddenly seems less solid, and of course we're going to freak out if we're still in ordinary mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like, I felt like there was no ground to stand on.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Like that, I really began to understand what that term meant, no ground to stand on.

**Speaker B:** Which of course there isn't in the end, but having that foundation of— That's right.

**Speaker D:** Well, the ground to stand is right here, it's the knowing. We take refuge in the Buddha. The Buddha is not only the physical Buddha that lived, but like the Buddha inside. The refuge. The knowing, it doesn't get entangled with good and bad. It doesn't get hurt. You just know it's pure. You can get, I mean, if you're not grounded or if you don't feel grounded, you just come back to the present moment and okay, I know, I notice things, but I don't go with them. I don't follow them. I know and it's safe. It's solid ground that you can come back to and anywhere then whenever you feel lost you can come back to the knowing. It's present, still, it's peaceful and it's safe, it's the refuge. So it's right practice and it's really safe and it's good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, one definition of Dukkha that is given, or suffering, is when the reality in your mind does not align with the actual reality, when there's a disconnect. There. So in a sense, when you're doing the Vipassana, the dry insight meditation, you're observing the thoughts about the reality in your mind, the one that's not the conceptualizations, the unwholesome reality. But the beauty of the Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's teaching and what Dhammarato is teaching is when you see that the reality, the conceptualizations in your mind don't match up with actual reality, you take the right effort and change it to the actual reality. So it would make sense then if you don't take that step, you would get lost. You would feel like there isn't ground to stand on because you're still just observing that conceptualized reality. And I think the path that the Vipassana meditation takes is once you get into that dark night of the soul, once you realize how unwholesome this conceptualized reality is, then you might start on the right practice. It's kind of like the been there, done that. Like, I really know that my mind wasn't thinking wholesomely. But you don't need to take that long path. You can do it right now and come to reality and be in the present moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know, Dan, I still have sort of reverberations of the anxiety.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And my confidence level kind of, you know, like everything else, it's impermanent, right? Things are ebb and flow. But Do you have any suggestions, some wisdom on sort of how to deal with that when the little voice in the head starts saying, well, you know, this is going to come back, this might come back, this anxiety there. You know, maybe it isn't, you know, the practice that's working, there's something else going on.

**Speaker B:** Sounds to me like you know exactly how to deal with that, Jeff. And we just had a wonderful reminder from our brother Muhammad here. I think you know. I think you know.

**Speaker A:** Just go back. Go back to reality.

**Speaker B:** Right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** Keep going back.

**Speaker C:** Let that mind up.

**Speaker B:** Take that deep breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Maybe a little smile. Ah, I see you, anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** There you are again, trying to play your tricks. Dhammarato talks about the right view being that the mind can be cleaned out no matter how obstructed it gets. It sounds like you're not dealing with too much obstruction there, just a little voice, just a remnant of a bygone era, an echo, right?

**Speaker A:** Maybe I just got to fine-tune the effort a little bit, eh? Because I have a nasty habit of being a very lazy young lad. And, uh, when things are going good, I tend to, you know, kind of just let things flow. And maybe, maybe I got to keep the effort going a bit.

**Speaker B:** And hey, that's, that's wonderful because, you know, we struggle to relax, us Westerners typically, right? So to have access to the relaxing is wonderful. And yeah, as you say, maybe just You need to sit up every once in a while. And I see you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see you, lazy boy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I remember I came up with an image one time. I can't remember who I was speaking with, but on this idea of cleaning the mind out, I came up with the image of shooing unwholesome thoughts out of the mind like a dog with muddy paws. You love the dog, right? You're kind to the dog. It's not a kind of— right? But you definitely don't want those muddy paws on your carpet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So there you're active, right? You're engaged. You're, you're, you're standing to attention. You do not want those muddy paws on your carpet. Yeah, but as you say, you're not going to kick the dog. Yeah, you're going to be kind to the dog. So yeah, that sounds— I think, I think you got a handle on it, Jeff.

**Speaker A:** I've been to the hell realms, let me tell you. I've been there a few times.

**Speaker B:** I believe you. Yeah, I've, I've, uh,

**Speaker A:** I have to say that, uh I don't know, if it wasn't for the practice, I don't like— to be honest with you, I don't know if I'd be around.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** I've been— yeah, that's how, that's how dark it's been for me. Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Wow. During the 10 years of practice or prior to?

**Speaker A:** Prior to.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Prior to. And then, uh, yeah, I pretty much had a mental meltdown 25 years ago.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And I ended up on medication. Wasn't hospitalized, but pretty darn close. Wow. And then just sort of, you know, the medication kind of was of assistance, right? You know, these typical antidepressants, the SSRIs, floods the brain with serotonin and it allows you to kind of avoid shit forever, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** After a while, you know, that just wasn't really doing the trick. And then just a lot of searching and then getting into the practice and then doing the dry practice and going back into the hell rounds again. And but then finally, finally getting this gladdening of the mind thing happening and woohoo, woohoo, drinks all around. Non-alcoholic.

**Speaker B:** Well, tremendous respect, Jeff, because I know how hard all of that can be. And to come from that and make the effort to find a practice and do a practice. Yeah, but it sounds like whatever practices you were doing over those 10 years did something for you. Did enough.

**Speaker A:** I've had some development. And you know, the dry Vipassana showed me a lot of stuff. Yeah, really, it really increased my wisdom. Yeah, but it also increased the Dukkha tenfold.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Something wrong.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** But, you know, I don't know that much about Buddhism, but he kind of talks about Sukkha, doesn't he? I wasn't seeing any Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. And what an ingredient to miss. That's hard mode.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's hard mode.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And you know, part of when you're doing the dry and sit meditation or the meditation without gladden the mind is you're waking up to anxiety that was already there, but now you're just more aware of it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Oh, absolutely. It's always there.

**Speaker C:** You met your friends outside and some people don't have a great taste of meditation because They just wake up more to their anxiety and they don't have a solution to that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** And my anxiety for— there goes that. You've hit the nail on the head because my anxiety comes from childhood experience for sure. I had a mother who was really anxious, clinically depressed, not treated, and, you know, would be violent. And I saw violence in the household. I wasn't physically hit, but I saw others being hit. So I grew up, you know, as a 2-year-old, I was like, holy shit, my mom doesn't have my back. And that's been, you know, that's been a monkey on my back for 57 years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. That childhood stuff will do it.

**Speaker C:** Everyone's got their own trauma.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think most people have been traumatized, at least to some degree.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I was reading about how trauma works. There's a guy by the name of— what's his name? He's a world expert in it. But he says even the subtlest things where you would never even know as a parent that you've created some trauma is just yourself to be stressed. A 2 or 3-year-old, even if you don't verbalize it, they pick up on it.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And then, you know, it's not, it's not like, you know, they're going to kill themselves, traumatic experience, but, you know, it creates a little bit of anxiety in them too.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, certainly. Your parents are your role models at a young age. That's who you kind of look to for everything, right? Because you're building your personality and your experiences. So you'll look to them to learn that stuff. So if they have a little anxiety you'll pick up on that and you'll probably adopt that without questioning it. It's not until later that you have more wisdom that you can realize that you don't need that anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So mom was effed up. It's me after all.

**Speaker C:** And one important thing to recognize is that oftentimes their parents were even more in the Dukkha. Their parents were even more anxious. And they've done a pretty good job at getting less anxious. That's how I feel, like they did a pretty damn good job given their situation without mental health awareness or Buddhist teachings or meditation. They did a great job.

**Speaker A:** I have nothing but compassion and a tender heart for my mom. I mean, she's dead now, but nothing but compassion and a tender heart because I mean, she was at wit's end herself, and there were 6 of us, all like 7 years apart. Like, come on, I wouldn't— if that doesn't drive you crazy, what would? What would?

**Speaker C:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** You won't catch me with 6 kids. No, sir. That is— that's hard mode too, right?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. Jeez Louise.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's beautiful to hear you talk about that compassion, Jeff. And the further we go back, of course, the closer we get to the two world wars where shit was just crazy. Oh yeah, Dukkha, Dukkha everywhere, you know, and no one had time to talk about much of anything. Yeah, let alone confide in someone about their mental health. I mean, mental health wasn't even a the term back then, you know, it

**Speaker A:** was like, just keep on and carry on, you Brits.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, go run into oncoming gunfire.

**Speaker A:** That's—

**Speaker B:** I don't feel so good. Well, go get shot.

**Speaker A:** That's— yeah, that'll make you feel better.

**Speaker B:** That, that's how it was for millions Right? And so then, you know, like a lot of their kids, if they had them, grew up without parents. Or if they were lucky enough to come back, they were scarred and had no way to deal with it. You know, the best that they could get was church.

**Speaker A:** My dad was sent to a foster home when he was 12 because his father left and mom couldn't feed all the kids. Yeah, so my father and, uh, one of his brothers was sent to a foster home. Yeah, you know, like, talk about scarring. It's like, Mom has abandoned me. And yet, you know, he was a pretty loving guy. Like, I just— he was amazing. He kept our family together.

**Speaker B:** Wow, wow, it's incredible to, to look, isn't it, at how adversity can breed wonderful, wonderful people. And some real assholes too.

**Speaker A:** Yep, the assholes can turn into wonderful people too though, right?

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's always a chance.

**Speaker A:** There's always a chance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let's get them in on these calls.

**Speaker A:** All assholes welcome. Maybe put that at the top. Uh, yeah, ask Dhammarato first. He might not be, uh, he might be okay with that actually. I could see him being okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the topic of trolls and such came up once with Dhammarato and them joining the calls. And the point was made that through text, people are much more inclined to troll because maybe there's less blowback, less you're actually interacting with the person, less of that. So you can type something and not have any blowback like you're saying. But when you're actually in a call with a person, even the troll would get a taste of joy because they're just in their own Dukkha. And that Dukkha, that situation ends up with them posting weird things on the internet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, text is anonymous and always ready to be misunderstood.

**Speaker C:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** You think about, you know, have you ever been trolled in a face-to-face interaction? It just doesn't happen. There's this whole phenomenon of internet trolling that's, you know, always going down in text. It is quite bizarre, quite amazing.

**Speaker C:** That's really the benefit of the one-to-one calls, the Sangha calls that we're having, is even when you're watching a YouTube video, you can have the YouTube video in front of you without actually engaging with it. And whenever they bring up something, you'll go into your memories about that thing and you might have some bad memories and then you might go and comment that. But when you're actually engaging with someone, you don't really have time for that.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** And the person, if they're wise enough, they'll be able to see when you're doing that and take you out of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get the smiles back, etc. Yeah, yeah, we were talking last week, weren't we, about the power of a community. There's a certain kind of gravity to, um, that Dharma, that good old Dharma. It has a pull.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was talking, uh, about not Sangha per se, but I was talking about you know, being with like-minded people with this lady I met at the garden because she has a lot of negativity. There's a lot of negativity in her and she has trouble seeing the good in people, right? And I said, you know, like, you know, consumption, you know, when the Buddha talks about right— what is the term? Consuming things in the mind, not only the body, but you have to eat the proper food in order to be a healthy person. You have to also consume things to be healthy. And part of that consumption is surrounding yourself with people that you generally like and maybe even admire, to take you up a level instead of You don't want to be going to the bar every week with a bunch of grumpy old bastards complaining about the same old thing week after week. You know, you want to be with people who are striving, not striving, but people that are working on development and working on, you know, gladdening the mind. You got it. Sometimes you got to dump people.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not that you hate them or anything. You want the best for them, but they're just, they're not good for you. And sometimes you have to to take care of yourself and to move ahead, to be in a good place for everyone, not only for yourself, but for everyone, all sentient beings.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Yeah, it's good for everyone for us to take care of ourselves. And who knows when that old friend who you used to complain with at the bar might pop up and say, hey, I'm not feeling so great, do you want to yeah, for a walk, you know. And then

**Speaker A:** all of a sudden you've got a brand new relationship.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And that could take— that could— that could take years, and you know, it might never happen. But yeah, by taking care of yourself, you put yourself in a position where some of those old friends who perhaps you've chosen to distance yourself from—

**Speaker C:** most

**Speaker B:** of the time you move on, people are aware of what you're into, if you're moving on to do something else. And I've had a few people come out the woodwork and say, hey, I've been struggling. I know you went and checked out this mindfulness stuff. What's it all about? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so once again, the cup overfloweth.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I think to change direction a little bit, I think mindfulness The way it's being kind of practiced in the West, like it seems like it's being almost sold as a be-all end-all and as a sort of a dry Vipassana technique here in the West. Like you have so many psychologists, you know, that are taking these mindfulness courses. And I really wonder if this is a direction that that should be taken, you know, without really a deep understanding as to the interaction between the mindfulness, the dry Vipassana, and the Samadhi, and all the other, like the precepts, all the other things that go along with it. Like you're pulling people, like psychologists are pulling people out of, you know, just out of society and, you know, they're doing maybe all sorts of unwholesome things, right? And teaching them mindfulness. So, you know, within a week you discover that you're a complete asshole and you have nowhere to go.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's a bitter pill, isn't it?

**Speaker C:** One thing to recognize about that is that even a little bit of Dhamma will help you find more Dhamma when you go forward. Like I'm sure you would be able to say, Jeff, that maybe you wouldn't have found as much benefit in Dhammarato if you didn't do the Vipassana beforehand, or you might not have been as turned on to him. So like, from my personal experience, I had experience with like a meditation app, Headspace, when I was younger. And I think those maybe gradual things building on each other, that interest helps one develop a deeper interest when the opportunity is given to develop that deeper interest.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker C:** Because I might, I might have just said, if I never had those experiences, that's just spiritual jargon and I'm scared of it and I don't want anything to do with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a good point. I don't know if mindfulness is the first thing you want to,

**Speaker C:** uh, uh, I should agree it's not like super ideal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I can say something on the side of therapy, which is I'm lucky enough to be married to a neuropsychologist here, and one of the things that she opened my eyes to was the sheer variety that's available in clinical settings. And so you'll have therapists who know their stuff and therapists who don't so much know their stuff. And you'll have therapists who are ripping mindfulness out of its context and just prescribing it like a medication. And you'll have therapists who are using it as part of a multidisciplinary practice with a specific purpose in a whole program of treatment for a client, and everything in between.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** And I think there's something that we can all be doing, which is precisely what we're doing here, which is to represent where it came from so as to make people aware of that context, right? So here's that therapist who's been prescribing mindfulness like a pill to everyone who walks through the door and one of Dhammarato's videos pops up on YouTube for him. Oh, what's this? Okay, it's just some folks having a casual chat about mindfulness. Well, oh, I didn't know that. Oh, okay. Hmm. Maybe I should think twice before making someone so aware of how much of an asshole they are.

**Speaker A:** I think, you know, I'm under the impression here in Canada, you know, a lot of people are taking, you know, they're social workers or they're psychotherapists or they're psychologists and they're taking like 3-day meditation courses, right? 3-day mindfulness courses. So they actually haven't done the practice themselves. And then so some of them think they know what mindfulness is after they take the course, right? Because they got the certificate.

**Speaker B:** Oh, wow. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Hopefully that is a minority, but I get an impression that it's there's a fair number of people out there, and

**Speaker B:** I'm thinking, wow, it happens. Yeah, I took a 4-year training course in Alexander Technique, and about halfway through that course, I was having a conversation with a singing teacher. We were catching up, and she asked me how I was doing, what I was up to. I said, oh, I'm doing some Alexander Technique training. She said, oh yeah, Alexander Technique, I love that stuff, it's great. I teach it to all my students. I say, oh cool, who did you train with? Maybe I know him. She said, oh, I— that someone came into my university when I was there and we did like a weekend course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I thought, wow, either I'm wasting a lot of time, or— and so it's, it's— there's, there's all sorts out there, isn't there?

**Speaker E:** There's a lot of that in therapy. I noticed that they steal those— the therapist takes stuff from like CBT is like all stoicism repackaged, you know. And then like you said, I mean,

**Speaker A:** it was a bit of a Buddhist, I think, or he had an interest in Buddhism.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, they grabbed from— they grabbed from these old traditions or the old philosophers. I mean, some of them, like some of them I've seen kind of take it from you know, like the whole magic realm, that like, you know, like the whole idea of manipulating things in your mind, you know, talk, you know, you're even what Dhammarato talks about where the parents talking to the child, you know, that's sort of, that comes from all religious type of stuff. You're basically making images of things in your manipulate, you know, it's not real, but they are real people in your head. Your mom, your mom might not be alive, but she is in your head somewhere, you know. So, so yeah, all these things are kind of, you know, latched on. But mostly I think that happens because the things work, you know, in some way. And people, you know, kind of go off and don't realize that there's more to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And then we come back around to the money-grubbing issue, right? Which is that as long as there's a buck to be made, then Yeah, someone's going to be happy to steal certainly old work because there's no patent on it. Yeah, it's too easy, right, to go digging around in some old books and come up with your new proprietary method. Yeah, yeah. And, you know, especially if it's shown to work, if there's some juice in it, you know, if it has practical value. Then hopefully the people that you're selling it to will get some benefit. And there you are.

**Speaker D:** But I think the true Dharma is taught for free. It should be taught for free. And like the Dhamma, it's free. It's the way to freedom. And anything that gets price tag on it, it's just against the whole path. It doesn't make any sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, meditation teacher that charges just runs away.

**Speaker C:** Right away.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, if there is a charge, there's stress about it, there's Dukkha, and there's greed in it, it's unwholesome. And it's, I don't know really how to say it into words, but the true Dharma is free and it's there. I mean, Dhammarato is doing it for free, obviously, showing his kindness to us. And all the Buddhist teachers, they're doing it for free and they are there. You don't have to buy a book to get into certain Jhana or something. You can find it for free because it is free. The Jhana is a state of freedom. It's not something that you buy or like a technique that you buy a book and okay, I'm going to apply it. No, it's a state of freedom from the world and you get it for free. You should get it for free. That's how you find it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Well, it's interesting, isn't it? When, you know, if you really were to press a teacher who's charging, you say, well, what am I buying exactly? What's the product? What do I get for my money? Well, I suppose an easy cop-out for the teacher would be that you're buying their time, but that's not worth a whole lot by itself, is it? People want a result. So then what? Can you buy a Jhana?

**Speaker A:** And what is it, First Jhana $100, Second Jhana $300? Oh, well, enlightenment $5,000.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker D:** it reminds me of someone who asked the Buddha, he asked him, what did you gain from your practice? What did you get from your enlightenment? And he told him, I didn't get anything, I just got rid of anger, from delusion, from the defilement of the mind. And that's the practice. You don't get anything. You just purify the mind. That's the practice of the Jhana.

**Speaker A:** You end up with nothing. Beautiful nothingness. You clean.

**Speaker D:** No, it's not nothing. It's more like emptiness because nothingness is a kind of perception. Emptiness, you know, it's not there. You know, the defilement, the bad things, okay, you clean them up and it's empty and it's free. It's relaxing.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, and as Dhammarato— I, I,

**Speaker E:** I will— that was one of the first things that I thought of with Dhammarato doing as many videos and calls as he does is, I mean, you know, I'm, I'm still not 100% clear what somebody gets out of that, you know. What does he get out of that?

**Speaker A:** He gets the joy of helping, the joy of spreading the Dhamma, I would think. He's a legit guy.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato means delight in the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** There you go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Perfect name for him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. He wears it well.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, the whole idea is completely foreign to me. I mean, it's amazing and I respect it completely. I just don't fully understand it yet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's very different, right, to what we're all trained into.

**Speaker E:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker A:** Well, the West is very transactional. Yeah, even marriage is transactional, you know.

**Speaker E:** It's like— it's actually everything.

**Speaker A:** You know, I'll stay with you until, like, you know, you're— until it's just no fun anymore, you're a pain in the arse, or, you know. Like my beautiful, my beautiful wife, she stayed with me through all of this stuff, all this dark nights. Wow. Darkness. And, you know, just like, wow.

**Speaker B:** Big respect.

**Speaker A:** Big respect.

**Speaker C:** It's important to recognize like where we come from in that regard, where our like cultural culture comes from. Because we were like products of pilgrims that come over from Europe, and those people are kind of inherently dissatisfied with where they were, so they were going somewhere else.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker C:** And then we go through, you know, migrating or spreading throughout and, you know, taking the land, and then civil wars, World War I, World War II. So our culture kind of has a lot of dissatisfaction with where we are and wanting to have something that someone else doesn't have. So to Christopher's point, we've kind of built these ideas of like you and me and like, this is mine, this is yours. And I'm not going to spread this, but really a more natural thing for humans to be is in more of a community of this is all ours. And these are just conceptualizations we've created. To protect things per se. And like, you know, our history helps put some context to that.

**Speaker A:** Well, once a society, a culture moves out of hunting and gathering, we slowly but surely move away from really understanding the interconnectedness between ourselves and nature, you know. And things just, they just gradually go to shit and things become transactional. Because we don't understand, like, you know, there's children now, it's so sad, you know, like, you know, there's so many kids in these big cities, these metropolises that have, you know, never been to a farm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** They think milk comes from the grocery store. You know, like, of course you're gonna grow up transactional.

**Speaker B:** I have a little sister who did go to the farm a number of times, and yet, uh, an ex-girlfriend of mine was sitting her one time. They made pepperoni pizza, and, uh, they, they ordered two pieces. They had a pepperoni pizza, and the other one was like a meat Feast, you know, with all the meats on it. And this ex-girlfriend of mine offered my little sister a slice of the meat feast pizza, and my little sister said, oh no, I don't want to eat that, I don't like the meat pizza. So what do you think pepperoni is? She didn't know that pepperoni was meat. She's been eating pepperoni pizza, didn't know that pepperoni was meat. And I'm sure there's many, many stories just like that. And you know, we've grown up in a relatively non-metropolitan environment. We're not out in the countryside, but we're in a small town. There's nature around and there's a farm that all the kids visit. And yeah, still, still, yeah, still we're that disconnected from where the food comes from. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** My wife is an art gardener. She loves gardening and she developed a friendship with a person just at a bus stop. They had the same bus stop going into town to go to work and they developed a bit of a friendship and she brought this woman over, her new friend over to the house and was showing her the garden. And this lady didn't know that potatoes grew underground. She just didn't have a concept of like where they grew, how they grew. Like, I guess she thought it was a potato tree or something, right? Or a potato bush. It just didn't know.

**Speaker B:** I did a long stint of veganism because this, this kind of coincided with my practice. When I realized how far removed I was from where my food was coming from, I started to feel like, well, If I don't want to kill the beast, why should I get to eat it? I wouldn't kill an animal. I wouldn't do that. So I just stopped eating meat for a long, long time.

**Speaker A:** Good on you. I'm not there yet.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Well, I've kind of come full circle. I'll now eat pretty much what's put in front of me.

**Speaker A:** As the Buddha did.

**Speaker B:** Right. I think it was very useful for me to examine my relationship to food.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker D:** Can I ask you, how did it affect your mental state being vegan and that kind of stuff? I'm kind of interested in it, and I was vegetarian for a while but couldn't maintain it, so I really want to know. How did it affect your mind, your state of being? Happier, more satisfied?

**Speaker B:** It would be impossible for me to tease out the veganism from the practice, unfortunately, Muhammad. I wouldn't be able to tell you what came from where. A better mental condition was forthcoming throughout that entire period to greater and greater degree. And it was, the veganism went very much hand in hand with the practice. I can tell you that my physical health was great, but also I can tell you it hasn't diminished. My health hasn't diminished for now reintroducing occasional meat. And something that I found out was that it's very difficult for us to get what we get from fish specifically oily fish. So that was the first thing that I reintroduced into my diet. And one of the— yeah, one of the vitamins in there in abundance is B12, which reportedly is good for concentration. Now, I certainly couldn't point to any profound difference in my mental state from any kind of diet that I've had. I recommend experimentation. Go ahead and try it, give it a fortnight minimum, see what happens.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I did it for a month or a few, or a couple months, and I felt like relieved that, okay, I'm not doing anything bad to animals in any shape or form. Like, I'm not contributing to any suffering. It kind of made me happy.

**Speaker B:** Really, right?

**Speaker D:** I felt happier about it.

**Speaker C:** Cool. Can I make a point about that? So with the precept of not violence or not killing, I think it's important to recognize that part of it is it takes a lot of Dukkha, it takes a lot of suffering within one's own mind to take one as far as to kill something living, right? And I think we can recognize the precept of that as like advice, advice in that situation not to go that far to like put yourself through all that, because that's what a lot of the precepts are, just really good advice. So I think it's important to recognize that and the difference between that and maybe eating meat that's been through a long chain of command and that you don't need to put yourself in any suffering to maybe just take that off a shelf, or if it's right in front of you, just to eat it. It would almost be more suffering to maybe deny that gratitude, right? So that's something we can watch.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, that's something that can be watched, you know, as we take the meat off the shelf, or as we take or deny a meal that someone else has prepared that has meat in it, we can be mindful and watching what's going on in us. Yes, is there any Dukkha showing up?

**Speaker C:** Right, I think the point you made about your sister and pepperoni was great, um, because we only— it only really makes us feel bad once we know it's meat. Um, there's, um, have any of you watched the TV show Better Call Saul? Oh yeah, there was a situation where there's someone who has a fear of electricity where like if you turn the light on, he gets very repulsed to it. But it's— but part of the story is— so there's a buildup to a case. So this person is afraid of any electricity. He has a heat lamp at his home. He doesn't have the lights on. But there's a court case and there's a big buildup to the situation and the trial is dependent on whether or not this fear is actually like a real clinical thing. And so the reveal is that like right as the trial is being made, a big point by the person arguing against him, the person slipped a phone into his pocket before the trial. And it had batteries in it and everything. So he makes the point, and the person who has the fear isn't aware of the phone actually in his pocket until the person points it out. So he takes it out, and once it's in his conscious awareness, then the fear starts, and then the whatever starts. And he did that in a very elegant way in front of everyone to see.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, skillful means.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker E:** Which wasn't cool.

**Speaker B:** What was that, Christopher?

**Speaker E:** Did it to his brother though, which wasn't cool.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, I enjoyed the Breaking Bad series. I never went on to Better Call Saul, but I know that— check it

**Speaker A:** out, it's pretty hilarious.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** I do.

**Speaker B:** Hilarious.

**Speaker C:** I like it a lot.

**Speaker A:** The character.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker C:** I think a part of art we can recognize, um, and a part of like anything that's created by other people is everyone's living in the same reality. Um, they might have their own conceptualizations of that reality or own pictures in their own mind. They might not be living completely in the present. Um, but at the end of the day, they're interacting with the same reality. So there will be Dharma in there. There's things to be taken away in art. And another value, I watched a video of Dhammarato that I uploaded a few days back of art, is that there isn't judgment involved. There's less inclination to judge things and more just to accept things as they are, accept the picture how it is.

**Speaker A:** Try to work with nature.

**Speaker D:** I think there's an assumption there that we are all living in the same reality. I wish that Dhammarato was here with us to talk more about it because it's kind of a deep thing. But the way I see it is everyone has his own reality. We create our experience and that's our reality. So we're like separated, but we think we're living in something.

**Speaker A:** I think maybe, I think maybe, but Sorry, I think maybe what Parker is pointing to is the reality of daily life and then the super mundane reality.

**Speaker C:** I think it can be agreed upon though that we have our own conceptualizations, but like when we're having wisdom at the point of contact, which we're in the present moment, It's generally agreed upon that we can't know for sure that it is the same reality we're interacting with, but a lot of the— with observation we can see that we're interacting. There might be some out there, whatever we're experiencing is similar in people's perceptions, although one person might be colorblind and one person might be able to see color. So the reality would be different that way, but we can point to like a physiological difference there, right?

**Speaker B:** We tend to be able to agree upon things that we can touch, see, taste, smell, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** We'd all rather eat a nicely baked pie than a cow pie.

**Speaker A:** I guess it is said the Arahants— part of being an Arahant is you throw everything away. So maybe there's a hint there that, you know, point of contact is getting really close to reality, but point of contact to an Arahant is just something else. There's something beyond that we can't comprehend.

**Speaker C:** I'd say most of it is comprehensible. Not in our hearts.

**Speaker D:** While in meditation, if you want to go into deeper meditation, what is real? What is real? I mean, in the Buddhist perspective, we focus on experience and whatever is experienced, that's real. So that's like the kind of perspective we go into. And if you do it in the practice of meditation, you can get really deeper meditation. Through that, you know, the experience, that's the reality that you're having, the experience, the hearing, the seeing, that's it, the thinking, even the thoughts, you see them as thoughts, you don't go with them, you just see them as what they are.

**Speaker A:** And that's what we're having.

**Speaker D:** Maybe someone else is having another type of reality, that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. Yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and these kinds of conversations can go very, very deep indeed, can't they?

**Speaker A:** Was Dhammarato your first teacher, Dan?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wow, lucky.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I really hit the jackpot. I had been listening to talks and reading books, and then I stumbled upon a Reddit post by our friend Noah, who's one of the directors of the new Open Sangha Foundation. And he was saying, my teacher's got space for new students, anyone can call up. So I went back all skeptical and said, I'm not sure I've got time for all this Buddhist stuff, you know, this and that. But there I am looking for it on the forum, you know, this was on the Reddit stream entry, you know. So I reluctantly called Dhammarato and we spoke for 3 hours. And I called him back the next day and we spoke for another 3 hours. And that went on as it does. And he said to me very early on, he said, what will happen here is you'll call less and less as you get the hang of it for yourself. And that's what happened. And it got to the point where, Christopher, you said earlier you just love to hang out. Right, so that's what the calls were in the end. We just hang out. And then someone very close to me attempted suicide, and I stayed with them for a good while, and we spoke on the phone a lot, and I helped them to get over that experience, gave them the good Dharma and Dhammarato said, cool, well, you're a teacher now.

**Speaker A:** Pretty much.

**Speaker B:** Off to work. Hi ho, hi ho.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That's awesome.

**Speaker B:** That's a beautiful story. I got very lucky with getting in contact with Dhammarato so early on. Yeah. And I'd been, you know, I'd had lots and lots of questions for a long, long time, like most folks who wind up in the Dharma. Um, but I hadn't actively been searching for a teacher until beginning of 2016, it was when Dhammarato and I met. And I'd been hearing from the teachers that I was listening to and the books that I was reading that direct guidance from a teacher is wise at some point, and I felt really ripe for it. I felt really ready.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm sure you see that with drumming too, the like just having someone to be there teaching you. I'm sure you can give a lot your students a lot more than them watching a video, for example.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And the video stuff with drums now is amazing. If you guys want to see some production value, you can type Drumeo into YouTube, and these guys have had every famous drummer in the world in through their studio. They've got thousands of hours of video lessons, and still students will come to me and say, "I've been doing the Drumeo thing. I feel lost. There's so much good stuff there, but I don't know what to do first." and I want someone to actually have a look at me, have a look at my technique, the way I'm doing things, and I've got these questions and those questions. And yeah, that direct guidance is just real important at some point. I would say that the drum student who throws themself at that video content and then comes to see me is in a really strong position.

**Speaker C:** Certainly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they've kind of oriented themselves to what it's all about, and then they kind of seem to know very well what they're there for when they then come to see me for a lesson.

**Speaker C:** I had a similar experience in sport where just being with someone one-on-one is incredibly helpful, and I think a big part of that is the audience size the teacher is speaking to. Because say, Drumeo is speaking to maybe 10,000, I don't know, 100,000, maybe a million people. So they give very broad suggestions or they give multiple suggestions. So it makes sense that people don't know exactly what to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Something interesting we've discovered though is that actually they have all of these famous drummers in and because these guys are the best players in the world, they're not often the best teachers. Yeah, you can see if you know how to look, you can see that often they're struggling to put into words what they understand so well practically. Most certainly, because they've not done it. They're off on tour, they're doing this band, that band, that recording, this recording, and then someone puts a camera in their face and says, okay, tell us how you do it.

**Speaker A:** And they're so advanced that their body just moves it, right? They just do it without thinking.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, teaching is a whole other skill set. It's not the same thing as doing.

**Speaker C:** It's a good point.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because, because you were doing sales before you taught sales, is that right, Christopher?

**Speaker E:** That's right. And then you have to go back and analyze what you did and try to, you know, I don't even know if my ex- explanation is the quote-unquote right explanation. But you know, yeah, you got to go through your head and kind of figure out, well, here's how I think about this. But yeah, it's— and you know, real good trainers, which I'm not going to put myself in that category, but I mean really great trainers, not only do they do that, but then they go back and relook and see if they're doing it right based on the feedback that they get. I'm sure you do that as a drum teacher. So You know, I mean, it's a skill that grows. It's just like any art or profession, you get better as you go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've had a long time. I've been teaching drums for 20 years, and I've not really done anything formal like you describe. I've not videoed many lessons. I've had a little bit of footage here and there, but I've just said all of it so much now to so many different people that I think I've had to find ways that work. Because if I try to explain it to someone in a way that doesn't work, they just stare at me blankly.

**Speaker E:** You get immediate feedback. So yeah. And then you switch it up. And then the next time you're like, okay, well, that works.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** It doesn't have to be any formal thing.

**Speaker B:** Thing.

**Speaker E:** I mean, just the fact of doing it something over and over like you're doing, that's gonna lead to good results. You get lots of feedback and then you alter things slowly until you get what you want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I've had lessons in which I've explained the same thing 4 or 5 different ways because the student just hasn't been able to get it, but it's been the absolutely appropriate thing to try to get the understanding for. And so we've just had it out, and it's been wonderful, actually. I've really enjoyed those challenges of trying to find that many different ways to explain an idea which at one time for me was that very much kind of autopilot, I just do it going back and— because my learning of the instrument was very much intuitive. I had a teacher in school, but he was an old-school guy. It was kind of book on the stand and exercise 1, exercise 2, exercise 3. I didn't want to know. I wanted to rock out. So I was pretty much self-taught. Then I had to go back, as you say, Christopher, and figure out how did I learn this stuff. It took a while. I would probably be shocked if I were to discover any footage of early teaching experiences. And what's interesting about it is the way that it works in the UK, I'm pretty much charging the same amount now as I was then. I don't know how I got away with it.

**Speaker E:** As long as you're better than the person you're teaching, that's all that matters.

**Speaker B:** Well, so they say, so they say, but the beginner who comes to me now is getting a better deal.

**Speaker E:** Sure, yeah, of course there's a difference, you know, a better teacher is always going to be better because they're going to set things up better and make things better to progress over the long run, but yes.

**Speaker B:** But you can get away with—

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, you can.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the beginner who it is their first teacher, they have nothing to compare to. So of course it's going to be great no matter how experienced, right?

**Speaker B:** That was paying my rent, Parker.

**Speaker A:** The years ago, these people now are thinking about Dan and they're like, man, did I ever get ripped off. Yeah, don't go to that guy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it could well have happened. It was, yeah, because I didn't know how to teach. I knew how to play drums, yeah, by the time I was teaching, but I didn't know how to teach.

**Speaker A:** Beautiful thing about teaching, I find, is that— I mean, I'm not a teacher, I'm an accountant, but I've, uh, you know, I've sort of taught the Dhamma a bit just through these casual interactions, and it's so cool because it deepens your understanding of it because you really have to think about it. Yeah, how do I put this into words? How do I get this? How do I get this person to understand it? Like you say, you know, you got to try. There's so many ways in, into, you know, drumming into the Dhamma. Yeah, you know, this person, how are they going to understand it, right? Yeah, it just really deepens your understanding. It's a beautiful thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I had long struggle with folks who like structured learning because that was so different to the way that I learned to play drums. So every now and then I'll get— I've had a couple of engineers come through, right? And they'll say, I want basically a spreadsheet. I want— I want to know how long do I do this, how long do I do that. And, uh, it took me a long time to figure out how to handle those folks.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, to your credit, Dan, have you heard the saying, um, If you know, or what? One sec. I had it for a second. If you do but don't know, or if you know but don't do, you don't know. If you know but don't do, you don't know.

**Speaker B:** If you know but don't do, you don't know. I haven't heard that one before.

**Speaker C:** But I'm sure you could have provided a lot of value just by giving that example. And I think you see the same with Dhamma teachers. The Dhamma teachers who can lead by example and you see them smiling, that's a whole lot more valuable than someone who can give instructions but you don't see them putting it in action.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Some of these people that are so advanced, you know, in the Dharma, they don't even have to say anything to you. Just observing them, you know, watching them how they tie their shoes is like deep. You know, you can just see it. Or, you know, the Dalai Lama, seeing the look on his face, you know, the joy within him is, you know, it's profound. It's a lesson in itself.

**Speaker B:** Certainly. He has a very friendly smile.

**Speaker C:** It's just great to see one who doesn't take everything so seriously. Like, he's not walking up on stage scared. He'll have a fun time walking up on stage.

**Speaker A:** That guy knows how to party.

**Speaker B:** And this guy is a political leader.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right?

**Speaker C:** So they say.

**Speaker B:** So they say. How's that for a demonstration of Dharma though? You know, you're there, you're giving a speech at the UN, or you're, you know, taking care of the— you're taking care of Tibet, and they are just smiling away. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I have a feeling he doesn't buy into the magical aspects.

**Speaker C:** Great seeing you, Christopher.

**Speaker A:** Oh, good seeing you again. Nice meeting you.

**Speaker B:** Bye, Christopher.

**Speaker A:** Bye.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you.

**Speaker C:** Have a good one. See you soon.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You were saying, Jeff?

**Speaker A:** Um, uh, with the Dalai Lama, I get a sense that he's, uh, he doesn't, uh, necessarily buy into a lot of the magical elements. Like, I know he's speaking about He's kind of condemning this, this notion of, you know, going to search for the next Dalai Lama and taking them away from the family and so on. And, you know, doing— you know, they do a lot of these magical things to find the next Dalai Lama, right? And yeah, although that's— they buy into it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, though as I hear it, there's some politics in that, which is to do with Tibet's relationship to China.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. Yeah, China has their own Tibetan Lama, right? There are, well, in another lineage, there's these Karmapas, which is kind of a different lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. And there's two Karmapas. There's the Chinese, the, you know, the CPP is saying, okay, the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP is saying, okay, this Karmapa is cool. But the other guy, you know, no. And the other Karmapa is in Nepal because he can't go back to—

**Speaker B:** right, right, right. Yeah, I don't know the whole story, but it sounds messy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And, um, yeah, maybe the current Dalai Lama is kind of, uh, two birds with one stone by— maybe he is kind of encouraging that let's forget some of this magical stuff but maybe he's also making a political maneuver.

**Speaker C:** Yes, there is the same situation as some monks where like only answer a question when it's asked, right? Like there are a lot of people who believe a lot of magical things around him. So if he were to say that no, rebirth doesn't exist or whatever, You wouldn't exactly get a positive response.

**Speaker B:** Chaos.

**Speaker C:** So this ties into Jeff's question earlier about, is it bad to talk about Buddhism in front of people who might get turned off to the idea? I think part of it is— Is

**Speaker B:** it bad to talk about reality in front of people who would be turned off by the idea?

**Speaker C:** And that's kind of harsh speech, right? Like, you might upset someone because you're showing the reality to them and the reaction might not push them in the right direction. You might instead be trying to maybe get something off your chest instead of actually looking out for their own happiness. And I think it's really great today because mental health is growing so widely where we can really teach Anapanasati or the Buddha-Dharma with scientific jargon. It's all there, and I think sometimes the Buddhist jargon gets a little magical, and it's really helpful to have this other stuff to rely on to know that it is really all in reality, that it is all in our experience, that we do have mini-nirvana moments every day. Nivarana is just cooling off.

**Speaker A:** The way I look at it, when you're out and about in the world, you know, if you have a lot of compassion, if you have a tender heart for people, people who are ready for the Dharma are going to see that there's something going on with you. And they're going to tune into it one way or another. And it might take a couple of months, it might take a year, but then they'll be like, you know, they'll tune into it and then you can open up, say, "Oh, well, oh, okay, you're interested in meditation? Oh man, I got a story for you." That's the way I do it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think that's great.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and in the meantime, you're just happy to sit quietly and Enjoy yourself.

**Speaker C:** I can try and get them to smile, teach them in like non-verbal ways, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I had lots of conversations with Dhammarato about how to kind of sneak the Dharma into the drum lessons. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right? Because a lot of the time folks actually want to be satisfied more than they want to learn how to play the drums, although they'll tell you otherwise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** But it's a— it's an interesting balance, you know, on this same thread that we've been talking about. I can't just drop a Dharma bomb, you know. And I remember feeling like it was a shiny gold coin in my pocket that I had to spend, you know. I really wanted to tell everyone about the Dharma. But it requires a little more subtlety. Otherwise, we are just proselytizing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's proselytizing, exactly. I think when you first start, like at least I had this, there was ego attached to the Dhamma, right? So you're learning the Dhamma, you're starting to get the theory of the Dhamma, you really don't know what the hell you're doing, but you got the theory of the Dhamma.

**Speaker D:** Dharma.

**Speaker A:** And I caught myself, you know, wanting to talk about the Dharma because it was kind of, you know, it's exotic and it's sort of, you know, it kind of makes you look like a smart guy, right?

**Speaker B:** Can do.

**Speaker A:** And I— Depends who you're talking to. What's that?

**Speaker B:** Depends who you're talking to.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, it can also make you look like an idiot, right? I caught myself doing that and it's like, oh, well, that's not wholesome, is it?

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. And yet more wholesome than pushing drugs.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, absolutely. Everything's relative, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I, I made some absolute stinkers, you know, sharing kind of early understandings with family or friends, or, you know, just really putting my foot in it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you and me both, friend.

**Speaker B:** And, and, and yeah, and you know, it's probably unavoidable, um, but the, the sad truth is you're probably, um, you're probably making it more difficult for that person to come to the Dharma in that moment, right? I have books at least one that I will hide when certain people come to my house, because I think to myself, if that person were to pick up that book and start reading, it would just turn them right off, right? Turn them right off.

**Speaker A:** Which book is that, may I ask?

**Speaker B:** Well, I have a Tibetan book that's wonderful poetry.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** It's called The Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomena, a wonderful book written by a Tibetan Buddhist. And it doesn't mess about, it's going right to that very deepest level. And I just think to myself, gee, you know, if certain members of my family were to pick up that book and start reading, I mean, it would damage our relationship.

**Speaker D:** Can you repeat the name of the book?

**Speaker B:** The name of the book is The Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomena. The author is Longchen Rabjam.

**Speaker D:** Okay, thanks.

**Speaker B:** You're welcome. It's a beautiful, beautiful text.

**Speaker A:** So you have some grounding in the Tibetan Buddhism?

**Speaker B:** I've had a look. At one point, Dhammarato was encouraging me to go and check out local Buddhist groups because I'd obviously spent all my time online. He said, hey, see if you can make some friends locally. And there was a group meeting in Bristol who were doing the Tibetan teaching, and they were lovely folks. And so I kind of checked that out for a while, checked it out enough to figure out that we're talking about the same stuff. You know, there's these— pretty much, right? That there's, there's these kind of circumstantial differences. You know, the monks wear different colored robes. That's about as far as the, the differences really go, uh, other than of course those that one might create in the mind. But, but when we, when we drill down and we get to that irreducible truth, it is of course irreducible.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Truth is truth is truth. And it, I mean, you know, it's fascinating that, um, you can find it in so many different cultures, written about in so many different ways. The, the Noble Dharma does show up in a lot of places. Sadly, it seems to be weighted toward the East, but, uh, when you know what you're looking for It's there in Zen, it's there in the Tibetan stuff. And I come across a Bible passage every now and then and go, yep, there it is.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, there are the Gospels. There's the Gospel, I think, of Saint— I forgot the name, I think it's John. But it's a Gospel that it was found in the 20th century. It was buried in a cave or something. So it was one of the early Gospels of Jesus and it was hidden. So it's the real deal of the Bible, Christianity. It starts with, "Those who understand this will see the deathless," something like that. So it's really on point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think you might be speaking of the Gospel of Saint Thomas, Muhammad.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think that's it. I think that's it. It was in the 20th century. It was found in Egypt from the Anagami library.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. Very interesting. You know, if they dig up that old one that's not been translated and translated and translated again.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I might take a look at that. I imagine that would be quite interesting. I found a real fun website one time which allows you to switch between 40-odd different translations of a Bible passage. So you click the link to the Bible passage and then you can flick through, and it's really interesting to look at all the different wordings. Sure, right. And to the point that I can't remember what passage it was that I was looking at, but half of the translations had it right on and half of the translations had flipped it so that it was precisely in the opposite direction. And you could see that the psychological flip that had taken place during whatever translation that it was. You know how the English language plays out often, you know, you can say the same thing but it means the opposite. Very, very interesting.

**Speaker A:** It was to show how like serendipity plays a role, eh, like with you, right? You hit Dhammarato Yeah, and it's like, wow, this is everything. It's nailed it. Whereas with me, I've been through a few teachers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I got super, super lucky, super lucky, because, you know, the student isn't necessarily qualified in the beginning to decide which teacher is worth hanging out with.

**Speaker A:** You aren't. You don't know. How are you supposed to know, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And there are a lot of people speaking with a lot of conviction about some very questionable things. Oh yeah, uh, you know, we don't have to look too far to catch one of those televangelists, and you know, they're very persuasive.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** So it's, it's great fortune to, to happen upon a teacher that will take you in the direction of Dukkha, Nirodha, from the beginning. Great fortune indeed, guys. This has been great.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it really has.

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna call it a night.

**Speaker A:** Nice to meet you all. I hope to see you all again. I will tune in again for sure.

**Speaker B:** Please do, Jeff. We're here, 8 o'clock UK time at least.

**Speaker C:** It was great meeting you, Jeff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, beautiful discussion, all you guys.

**Speaker B:** Great hanging out with you. And Muhammad, thanks for popping up and contributing as well. Really great to hear from you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you, Muhammad.

**Speaker B:** Thanks to anyone who's listening. I think we might have— and Eric,

**Speaker C:** if you're still there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, Eric, if you're still there, then, uh, great, great to all be together, even if we're only listening. So

**Speaker D:** thanks, guys.

**Speaker B:** I'll catch you all next week, okay? Oh, sorry, Eric, what was that?

**Speaker C:** What was that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, go ahead. Oh, that it was nice listening to you. Good, I'm glad. And guys, let's all stay in touch throughout the week as well. If anyone wants to say hi, I'm around.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful. Thank you, Dan.

**Speaker B:** Hey guys, great to see you all.

**Speaker C:** Good to see you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Well and happy.

**Speaker D:** See you all.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk is a friendly, informal conversation among Sangha friends, with Dan facilitating in Dhammarato's absence. The discussion covers several key themes from the practice taught by Dhammarato (who follows the lineage of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa). Here is a summary of the main points:

### Core Practice Insight: Gladdening the Mind
*   Multiple participants (Jeff, Dan) shared that the pivotal shift in their practice came from **"gladdening the mind"**—cultivating a happy, relaxed state *before* deepening meditation. This was contrasted with "dry" Vipassana, which they found could lead to anxiety and instability without this foundation of joy and tranquility.
*   Jeff credited this approach with transforming his practice after 10 years of struggle, calling it a "key that unlocks the whole thing."

### Importance of Community (Sangha)
*   The group emphasized the value of connecting with like-minded practitioners. They discussed how sharing the Dhamma in daily life should be organic and non-proselytizing—often just mentioning meditation casually can open a door for others who are ready.
*   They noted that the Dhamma is shared freely in this tradition, seeing charging for teachings as contradictory to the path of freedom.

### Cultural Context and "Magic"
*   The conversation touched on cultural differences, noting how Thai culture's innate understanding of happiness differs from the Western critical mindset.
*   They discussed Buddhist texts and stories, viewing much of the "magical" elements as allegory or parable meant to convey deeper truths, not literal supernatural events. The focus should be on practical, experience-based reality.

### Challenges and Trauma
*   Jeff shared his personal history with anxiety and depression, linking it to childhood trauma. The group discussed how meditation can initially make one more aware of underlying anxiety, and the importance of having the right tool (gladdening the mind, taking refuge in the present moment) to work with it skillfully.
*   The practice was framed as a way to cleanse the mind of defilements, not to acquire anything.

### Teaching and Sharing the Dhamma
*   Participants agreed that sharing the Dhamma works best through compassionate example and casual conversation when others show interest, rather than forceful teaching.
*   Dan shared his story of coming to the Dhamma, getting "super lucky" to find Dhammarato as his first teacher, and how the guidance eventually led him to share the teachings with others in turn.

### Broader Philosophical Threads
*   The talk meandered into related topics: the transactional nature of Western society, the value of art, dietary choices (veganism), and finding echoes of the "irreducible truth" in various spiritual traditions, including Christianity.

**Overall Essence:** The talk was a supportive Sangha gathering reinforcing a central, joy-based approach to Dhamma practice. It highlighted the importance of community, shared personal breakthroughs and struggles, and explored how to integrate and share these teachings wisely in everyday life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this transcript, the conversation is a friendly, informal discussion among practitioners of Buddhist meditation, sharing personal experiences and insights. The metaphors and stories used are drawn from everyday life, personal struggles, and cultural observations to illustrate points about meditation, mental health, and the Dharma (teachings). Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **"Gladdening the mind" as a "key that unlocks the whole thing."** This is the central metaphor of the talk. Speaker A (Jeff) describes how shifting his practice to focus on cultivating happiness before meditating "phenomenally changed my practice." Speaker B (Dan) agrees it was the "pinpoint thing" he learned as well. It's contrasted with the "hard mode" of dry insight practice.

2.  **Meditation practice as "banging my head against the wall."** (Speaker A) A vivid metaphor for futile, frustrating effort before finding the right approach.

3.  **The Dharma spreading "like a beautiful virus."** (Speaker A) An ironic, positive twist on the concept of a virus, emphasizing how beneficial teachings can be contagiously passed on through casual contact.

4.  **Shooing unwholesome thoughts "like a dog with muddy paws."** (Speaker B) This metaphor describes the active but gentle effort of mind-cleaning: you are firm in not allowing the "mud" (unwholesome thoughts) onto your "carpet" (a clean mind), but you are not cruel to the "dog" (the mind itself).

5.  **The "ground to stand on" in meditation.** Speaker A describes his anxiety during dry insight practice as feeling like "there was no ground to stand on." Speaker D (Muhammad) counters that the "ground" is "the knowing" or present-moment awareness, which is a "safe" and "solid" refuge.

6.  **The mind's conceptual reality vs. actual reality as a "disconnect" causing suffering.** (Speaker C/Parker) This frames Dukkha (suffering) not as an abstract concept, but as a practical misalignment between our mental projections and reality.

7.  **Childhood anxiety as a "monkey on my back."** (Speaker A) A common metaphor for a persistent, burdensome problem.

8.  **Western cultural mindset as inherently transactional.** The speakers contrast the gift-economy of the Dharma with the Western view where even relationships and marriage can feel transactional ("I'll stay with you until... it's no fun anymore").

9.  **Teaching as finding "many different ways in."** Both Dan (on drumming) and Jeff (on Dharma) use this metaphor. It highlights that a good teacher finds the right door or path for each individual student, as there isn't just one way to understand a complex skill or truth.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Dan's Drum Studio Story:** He narrates the ironic timing of building a perfect new teaching space with a friend, only to use it for one week before the pandemic lockdown forced him home for three months. This story illustrates impermanence and the frustration of plans disrupted.

2.  **Jeff's Garden Encounter:** He tells the story of meeting a woman in a public garden who had given up meditation because "it didn't work." Their casual conversation allowed him to indirectly share his positive experience with Dhammarato's approach, potentially "turn[ing] her on" to it. This story embodies the theme of sharing the Dharma skillfully and casually, not proselytizing.

3.  **Jeff's Personal Journey Through "Hell Realms":** He shares his history of severe anxiety, a "mental meltdown," reliance on medication, and a decade of frustrating "dry" meditation practice that increased his suffering. His eventual discovery of "gladdening the mind" is a pivotal narrative of relief and transformation. He starkly states, "if it wasn't for the practice, I don't know if I'd be around."

4.  **The Pepperoni Pizza Story:** Dan tells a humorous story about his younger sister not knowing that pepperoni is meat, using it to illustrate how disconnected people (even in semi-rural settings) can be from the source of their food. This ties into the larger discussion about transactional societies losing touch with nature.

5.  **The "Better Call Saul" Anecdote:** (Speaker C/Parker) References a plot point where a character's psychosomatic fear of electricity only triggers when he becomes consciously aware of a battery in his pocket. This story is used to discuss how awareness itself can change our relationship to an object or idea (like meat), and how much of our reality is constructed by our conscious perceptions.

6.  **Dan's "Teacher Origin" Story:** He recounts how he stumbled upon Dhammarato via Reddit, had marathon initial calls, and was eventually told "you're a teacher now" after successfully using the Dharma to help a friend through a suicide crisis. This is a story of serendipitous discovery and the natural, non-formal progression into sharing wisdom.

7.  **The Gospel of Thomas Reference:** (Speaker D/Muhammad) Briefly mentions the discovery of this early Christian text that begins with a Dharma-like promise ("Those who understand this will see the deathless"). This story supports the group's theme that profound, non-dual truth appears in many traditions, often buried or translated out of mainstream religious texts.

### **Overall Themes Woven Through Metaphors & Stories:**
*   **The inefficacy and danger of "dry," critical meditation** vs. the **efficacy and safety of an approach based on gladdening the mind and kindness.**
*   **The importance of community (Sangha)** for sharing experiences that others might find odd.
*   **Cultural contrasts** between Eastern (Thai) and Western mindsets, especially regarding happiness, self-criticism, and transactionality.
*   **The idea of "right view" and "right practice"** as accessible, non-magical, and based on present-moment reality.
*   **The responsibility and skill involved in sharing the Dharma**—avoiding proselytizing, waiting for interest, and leading by example (like the Dalai Lama's smile).
