### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so yeah, yeah, yeah, it's okay.

**Speaker B:** That's, that's an important point to recognize. Um, there, there is a great deal of joy that comes when we finally figure it out and we know that we've got it figured out. But often that figuring it out is not intellectually understanding it. In other words, in a particular artist thing, let us talk about it as a carpenter, or it could be anything even like bricklaying. And the student comes and watches the old master carpenter take a turn with the wood, you know, with his, with his plane, and he'll turn it or shave it in a certain way or use the chisels in a certain way and come up with a very beautiful product. And the student sees that happening and he says, yeah, I got it. I know what's going on. And yet when he does it, it doesn't seem to quite fit exactly right. The first time or whatever like this. And so now we can begin to understand that in our practice, a lot of students want to have that intellectual understanding. And that a good place that you can see that is in what you would call Buddhist scholarship. Okay, where they want to know and want to know more and more, and they'll read this sutra and they'll read the next sutra and they'll read this book and they'll go visit that guru, and they keep looking and wanting more and more and more data, which is basically like the student in the— in the carpenter shed wanting to know every tool and how it's used and all of that kind of stuff, but they really haven't learned how to do much of anything yet. Just want a lot of knowledge, thinking that we can knowledge our way into skill development. Okay. And the other way, though, is that we don't need to know a lot. We only need to know just enough, just enough for correct practice. And this is an important point because a lot of students say, not just in the sense of calling me, because there's good opportunity. I do a lot of repetition and over and over again to get what we do need to go deep, as opposed to 10,000 different things. And there are 10,000 different stories or 10,000 different suttas. There's 100,000s of books. There's already enough that's written, but we get into the idea that in fact, we are trained that way. A good example, I don't know how it's done in France, but in the United States, the way that they teach mathematics is almost guaranteed for the kids to not be very good at math. Yeah, and they give it a little bit at a time, a little bit at a time, but then make them really, really get to that part. Like arithmetic, year after year after year of arithmetic, when in fact some very interesting things can get done. That a way of looking at it, in fact, that calculus could be taught in the 4th and then the 5th grades, and the students can get it because they're getting it a little bit at a time. We can add geometry and calculus and algebra right along the way. But in our culture, no, it is you've got to get 5, 6, 7 years of arithmetic before we give you any algebra. And then it's algebra, algebra, algebra for years before we give you any more stuff. That's the way that it's kind of taught. And that gives us always the idea that we're not getting enough. There's more to this than that. They're holding out on us.

**Speaker A:** It's like a craving, right? You're always craving more information. And it was yesterday I was listening to one of your talks with some students. I think it was a Sangha call. And you said something. On the line of, you said, you already know how to be happy. Like you don't need more information. And I was like, oh, right. I'm clearly listening a bit too much talks. Like I know how to do it. I need to practice now.

**Speaker B:** Every child knows how to be happy. Our children are born happy and we beat it out of them. And then some of them will say, well, how can I be happy? The answer is you were happy before you were unhappy. You already know how to be happy. Ah, so we already have just enough. And we don't need too much piling on of more and more and more information, that there are certain subtleties that we can look into. But we could basically say that, well, they're not so much subtleties as that it's the way that the student asks the question. But it's always back to the same thing. You can ask the question from this side and from that side and from under and from over and all around, and we can address it from that. But basically we're all pointing to the same thing, which is don't worry, be happy. There's really not much to it.

**Speaker A:** It's the opposite of piling up and gathering stuff and just letting go. So it's, yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** In fact, that's exactly correct, that in all the religions that I know of, it's an additive thing, just like all of our culture. The banker is a better banker because he's got more money. More, yeah, that a religious leader is more religious because he's got more religion. And so we think that there's more and more and more to get. And so the Westerners then come to the teaching of the Buddha with that idea, and they want more and more and more. They want more attainment, they want more joy, they want more of this and more of that and more knowledge, etc. like that. And to recognize that really there's only— we need just a little. Just a little dab will do us, and that if we're taking that and practicing it correctly, we'll be okay. That in fact, that happened to me when I was learning to play the piano as a child, that I was never satisfied with the music that the teachers would give me. I would want to practice the stuff that the older kids were practicing. And Because of that, I wasn't learning the basics that I needed to learn from the simpler music. And I see that that happens often with meditation students, is that they want more data and more data and more data to, in fact, just enough. Well, what is that just enough? Well, it's the Eightfold Noble Path. That's all we need. If we would practice the Eightfold Noble Path the way that it's specified in the suttas, we wouldn't need any other sutta. I think the reason that I talk to the students so much about all the various suttas is because I spent all that time researching because I thought I was missing something and I needed to do it. So now all I've got is just a bunch of extra knowledge that I don't need when I need to make sure that I'm at least teaching them the basics that they do need. Because if you've got the basics, that's really all we need. Yeah, and that is to get the mind fit for work and then take a look at what's going on. And in fact, getting the mind fit for work is looking at what's going on. So basically, that's the whole practice, is just look at what's going on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that makes sense, because you're looking, uh, about the thoughts you're having and how you're judging your emotions or maybe the circumstances and how this is affecting your mood, right? Like, I don't like this breath or like I don't know enough. And if you can catch them, you kind of understand. Is this how this works? Like, you kind of understand what you're doing, what's happening and what's causing you a— Yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** I would go then so far as to say, all right, that the one knowledge that the students need above all other knowledge that we don't get, that we look at all the details to where in fact there is only one real knowledge that we need, and what is that? The knowledge of Dukkha. Okay, it goes like this. Imagine then, in that regard, that we walk into the kitchen, uh, in a new kitchen that we've never been to before, and we, uh, just haphazardly, we're just leaning against a counter or a surface, and it turns out to be one of these newfangled stoves that's red hot, but we can't see it. We put our hand right on that that burner. Okay, yeah, now that we burned our hand, we pull our hand back. I do not have to examine every little crease at every little finger for every little burn mark. But the real thing that I need to know is don't put your hand on a hot end of fire. Yeah, that's what we need to learn, is fire is hot. Don't put your hand in the fire and you need to look to recognize various kinds of fires. This is a new kind of fire that we've learned. It's hot. Don't put your hand in it. OK, so Dukkha is like that. It's like fire, but it appears in many, many different forms. But the only thing that we really need to do then is develop the skill of recognizing Dukkha. Because we've already now begun to understand that Dukkha is to be avoided, that I don't have to go dig into the Dukkha to find out that it's hot. And that seems to be the mistake that they make in the Mahasi Method, is the students are supposed to dig into the Dukkha deep enough that they find that it's hot. And the answer is, it was hot all along. Wakey wakey, it was already hot.

**Speaker A:** And that's how— so you have to know it, for you have to know the Dukkha for— so you can see when it comes and that you're doing the, this mental process that's leading to suffering, like unhappiness, unsatisfaction. But sometimes, for example, during the retreats I knew what— I mean, at some point I knew, sometimes I didn't, but I kind of knew like I was wanting something and that was making me suffer. But at one point my mind was tired, and how does this tired mind affect the Dukkha? Because I had all the knowledge I needed, but at some point I think I maybe had some blind spot and This was enough for like this mental process to start, or maybe I didn't see it.

**Speaker B:** Well, there is— yeah, here's an interesting thing about the tiredness, is that if you are tired and you recognize that you're tired, then you can do something about it. But if you're tired and you don't like the tiredness and you don't want to be tired then you will stay in a situation that may be dangerous. In fact, driving while we're tired, driving a car while we're tired is a very, very foolish, dangerous thing to do. I know I've done it and I've sat there saying, well, I've got to get up to Greensboro. I'm going to be able to make it. The next thing I know, the car is whirling. And that's when I say no. I have to recognize the mind is tired and it is dangerous to continue on. Okay, so here's what happens in the meditation retreats is that you're doing something new and doing it over and over again, and the mind is naturally going to get tired because it's doing something that's never done before. And we don't then know, we can't see that a tired mind is prone to Dukkha. It's dangerous. All right. If we could see that the tiredness was prone, then we would say, well, let me take a break.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Let me go ahead and take a break. Let me lay down and take a nap or do whatever I need to do so that I can gain that fitness back and do away with the tiredness. But if I leave it and ignore it and want it to go away, it's not, it's going to remain dangerous.

**Speaker A:** So it's ignorance about how the mind works, right? Or maybe denial. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And yet when we go to these meditation retreats, we say, oh, well, I'm supposed to follow the rules. I'm supposed to do what I'm supposed to do. And they told me that I'm supposed to do this, and they didn't mention what to do when the mind got tired. So that means that the mind's not supposed to be tired. Tired, and I'm supposed to sit here and practice while the mind is tired. Well, guess what? A mind that's tired in meditation is just as likely to go into the ditch as the car is when you're sleepy and tired behind the wheel. Right. So that's the way to then begin to look at it, is that we need to do something about that tiredness and seeing it for what it is and recognize that it's dangerous. To try to do something while we're tired. And then so take a break, go take a walk. The Buddha actually has a whole list of things that we can do, including rubbing our face, rubbing our arms, taking deep breaths, standing up and walking. And above all, if none of that works and we're still tired, go take a nap. The Buddha actually recommends that, but the meditation retreat leaders won't. Yeah, yeah, they say, oh, you're supposed to be in here practicing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just— yeah, I wanted to see how the tiredness could, uh— but, uh, yeah, that makes sense because when you're tired, you're trying to— you go from, uh, gladdening the mind, trying to fix the mind, and yeah.

**Speaker B:** And when we're tired, we're not capable of dealing with tiredness very well. We say, oh, you're not supposed to be tired. And we start listing our set of rules that we're supposed to be following, just like I was doing when I didn't wreck the car. But I knew that if I continued driving tired, that I would. And so I had to stop. That was an important point. To recognize. And then I began to say, oh, wait a minute, this is the same thing that happens with students in meditation too, that being tired is not conducive to good practice, that getting rest is what we need to do, and that in fact, mostly, if we're practicing correctly, we don't get tired because we're practicing being relaxed. And so if we've gotten ourselves tired, that indicates that somehow or another we're not correct in practicing, that we'll get us tired when we're driving a car. If we've been driving a car for hours and hours and we get tired, whatever we're doing, we get tired of doing that. That's just the nature of the human existence. So from that perspective, we can say, okay, I've gotten myself tired. What was I doing that got myself tired? And so that I can avoid that next time. Wanting something out of meditation and not getting it is an easy way students get tired. Also, not breathing well. If you're— we get tired when we're not breathing very well. The mind's not getting the kind of oxygen that it really needs. But we also recognize from science that the average human attention span is only about 20 minutes anyway. And that anything that we're doing is not going to be permanent, that the mind gets tired. And so allowing that and forgiving ourselves for being tired.

**Speaker A:** Part of understanding how the body and the mind works, I guess, just like you want to train without rest forever. Like the body needs some rest. Yeah, okay. So it's part of knowing how— so.

**Speaker B:** Knowing, knowing what's going on is the right thing to do. And to— and like I said, there's a few things that we can do, but if that doesn't work, then going ahead and getting the rest that we need is what, uh, is the correct thing to do, even if we're not following the rules of the retreat center. That's the problem with rules, is rules just don't handle every situation. That's why we need wisdom rather than rules, because wisdom is taking care of the situation directly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've seen that in training, actually. Maybe sometimes, like, you create a training plan for a client or for yourself. And so you try to follow the plan and it's going well, but maybe sometimes you're getting tired and you would have to not follow the plan in order to recover and be even more efficient. But if you stick to the plan and the rules that you set yourself, your individual needs are not always met because the program is not changing, it's not adapting to the thing you do, and it's even less efficient than if you just kind of like we call that auto-regulate, meaning you kind of get feedback from your body and to modify and change the plan for the day. Maybe if you didn't sleep at night, you cannot follow the plan and put the same weight and stuff.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** So that's really— yeah.

**Speaker B:** So driving a car tired is a hindrance. Working out and doing bodily things being tired is a hindrance. Also, correct practice of Anapanasati, getting tired, that's a hindrance. But a lot of the students say, oh well, I'm tired, that doesn't mean anything, let me push the tiredness away and practice correctly. No, if the tiredness is there, we need to deal with the tiredness. If we get tired, then we need to do something about it to come untired. Breathing, taking a break, going on a walk. Rubbing our limbs, stimulating. And if none of that works, then taking a nap would be the correct practice. So, and forgiving ourselves for being tired. In fact, we can say, oh, I'm too tired now. I don't have to do anything. That in fact, that attitude begins to be correct practice. The correct practice when you're tired is to enjoy being tired. Because when we really are tired, that's when we really can relax, if we let ourselves just completely relax. And if I need to lay down to relax, that's okay. The important thing is to stay relaxed rather than continuing to work when we're tired because we're not supposed to be. The bell hasn't rung yet or something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's stupid.

**Speaker B:** So these are the hindrances that we can start to pay attention to, including tiredness, and recognize that, oh, I can make whatever is happening to my best advantage, that anything is happening, I can improve that right now. Then instead of being tired and hating it, I could be tired and love it. To come back to that nurturing state, that's what we're looking for, is to come back to being in a state of nurturing, to gladden the mind in that way. So That's the— that's the— basically, you already got it with the tiredness. I think you, you, you understand that. Do you have any other questions? I'm sure that you got several.

**Speaker A:** Um, well, so that's part of knowing the Dukkha, right?

**Speaker B:** And that's the knowing of the Dukkha, to know that tired is not Dukkha. But tired and not liking it, that's Dukkha. Tired and wanting to do something other than being tired is Dukkha. But tired and knowing that you're tired and allowing yourself to be tired and put yourself into a state of relaxation to recuperate, that's not Dukkha. So this knowledge thing that we were talking about is that all we need to do is to have correct knowledge of Dukkha. And that correct knowledge is also the knowledge of what to do about it. What is the right effort for whatever is going on?

**Speaker A:** So yeah, it's like experience, like experience of the, of this process. Okay. And, and so the, the goal, I mean, the Yeah, the point of doing this practice is, um, like getting— like realizing every time you create Dukkha for yourself, what you did and how you did it, so you don't have to do it again.

**Speaker B:** Right? Right. You've probably heard that some of them talk about, um, in the Mahayana method, steps 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have to do with fearfulness, misery, disgust, anger, and a strong desire to get out. And in Western Buddhism, this is referred to as a dark night of the soul. Another way of talking about this is hitting rock bottom, which is the way that it's talked about in AA and other things like that. Basically what we're talking about hitting rock bottom means that finally, after all, the student can finally see the Dukkha. The alcoholic can't see the Dukkha as he's going down, but once he gets to a certain point, which is called rock bottom, is when he crash lands. So you can imagine then that the airplane pilot, he can see that the plane is in a nosedive, but he doesn't recognize the danger until he hit the plane, until the plane hits the ground, when he's hit rock bottom, there's where the danger is. But if he is wise, he can see that his plane's in a tailspin and he could do something about it before he hits the ground. This is the real teaching of the Buddha. The real Anapanasati is to be able to get good at seeing little Dukkhas so that we can avoid them without having to hit rock bottom with a great big Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like seeing this subtle, the subtle, like, injuries.

**Speaker B:** Right, the little ones. That's where we begin to get good at it. Here's an example of that. Two people are in a great big argument. When does the argument end? The argument ends when one or the other people recognize that this is going nowhere. This is a bad idea. Idea, or even, "I've gone too far." And often those kinds of arguments end with someone slamming the door on the way out, or making a noise as they leave, to show their unsatisfactoriness. Now, here's the point: If no one sees the Dukkha in the argument, the argument will continue until someone does see the Dukkha. Even if that's the point of violence. Once the guns come out, once the knives come out, then people can see the Dukkha. But that's not also true. Sometimes people wind up trying to bury a body, and that's when they recognize the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Maybe you have gone too far.

**Speaker B:** When they go way too far. OK, so now we can say, all right, well, if I'm going to see the argument as a Dukkha, how soon can I see the argument as a Dukkha? Can I see it as soon as I get into the argument? This is going no place. Why should I argue with someone for 10 minutes before I get my gun out?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And then maybe you can see it like even when you just feel triggered, like in yourself before you interact and stop that right away.

**Speaker B:** Knowing that arguments almost always have a bit of anger and frustration built in them, how soon can I see the anger and frustration? In other words, If I even start to make one loud noise, if I get loud one time, should that not be enough for me to be able to see the Dukkha? Or if I start to put my hand on that hot stove and I begin to feel the warmth as my hand gets close to it, I don't have to put my hand all the way on that stove to feel the Dukkha. Okay, so this is what we're getting at, is that can we begin to see the Dukkha early. Can we see the way that things are headed? Well, guess what? This is an excellent definition of the word wisdom, is to see where things are going, see which way things are headed. And a good example of that, because it's so clear, not because it's a good example otherwise, but on a gun range, or when hunters are out hunting, where those guns are pointed is important. In other words, if an officer has his gun in his holster, it's pointed to the ground, it's not dangerous. If he pulls that gun out of the holster, it's dangerous. Now you got to start watching where he's pointing that gun. This happened to me when I was a teenager. In fact, I was only about 14 or so when I learned this lesson, because some old man had come to the hunt with with us, and he was carrying a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun, and he had it over his arm just hanging down. And as he was walking around, that gun was pointing at various knees, and the people who had those knees did not like the fact that that guy was not mindful of where his gun was pointed. Later, I got that from some other students that said, yeah, they've been on gun ranges and that's the important thing, which you don't point that gun in any willy-nilly way. You make sure that you know which way that gun is pointed all the time, because if it goes off, the bullet's going to go in the direction of the barrel where it's pointed. Right. So we can use that now as a very excellent method of understanding what wisdom is, is looking where things are going. We don't know where that bullet is going to actually hit or when the gun's going to go off, but we do know which direction the barrel is pointed. And that's wisdom, is to keep track of how things are going, which way things are pointing. And if we can see that, then now we're beginning to get really good at seeing Dukkha, because we can see the way things are pointing, which way things are headed. You can do that with another person in the sense that you use one word and they get a great big scowl on their face. Don't go in that direction anymore. Let's make a change. So this is the way that we begin to understand it, is that the real wisdom is then seeing which way things are headed, not a whole bunch of knowledge. Not a whole lot of information, not a whole lot of books full of suttas or math or anything else, but rather real wisdom is just looking at how things are, the circumstances, how they're headed. An example would be when you're tired driving a car, you should automatically see, hey, I should park this thing while I'm still awake enough to be able to park it, because otherwise I'll tell myself, oh, I can drive and still be tired. And that's dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. All right, so we can do the things in advance. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. That's really like observation, like, uh, yeah, and knowledge of, uh, of the signs leading to.

**Speaker B:** Right. So we can, we can apply that in our practice when we're in seclusion and recognizing these kind of thoughts. If I go down that path, that's dangerous. Let me not go down that path. Let's stop thinking about that email and come back to the present moment. Thinking about that is dangerous. And as we begin to develop that skill of wisdom while we're sitting, we can also begin to develop that when we're around other people, when we're not in seclusion. And we can begin to see how things are headed so that we can straighten it out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I guess I noticed that the more I do it, when I feel very awesome, very glad, and just like something very subtle happens, I can immediately feel the, like, the little bit of drop in satisfaction. And so that allows me to ask myself more easily, oh, what did I do? Like, how did I get less satisfied right now? And then I can see it more than when I'm just like full of— because there is like a sign, more like I can feel it.

**Speaker B:** So precisely, yes. This is why the teaching of the Buddha on Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, that first noble truth, that's the big doozy. That's it. Now, a lot of people in the West, they misunderstand. They think that all life itself is dukkha. Well, life itself is not dukkha. We all love to be alive. That's the very, very best thing about any kind of existence, is that you know that you exist. And so being alive, that's not a problem. Dukkha is not life itself. But also in that regard, other people will say that the Buddha teaches that dukkha is inherent in things like the world, that the world is dangerous. No, that's not the case. The world itself is not inherently Dukkha. All Dukkha has a particular cause: greed, ill will, and delusion. And if there's no greed, ill will, and delusion, then there's probably no Dukkha heading our way. So we can't say that the Dukkha is inherent. It's because we don't see what's going on. Here's a good example. They talk about this stuff, and even in the legal documents, they talk about an act of God, like, oh, we're not going to pay for your fire insurance because your house burned down because it was an act of God. Lightning hit it, and therefore we don't have to pay you, or a tsunami or whatever like that. And that one of the things— there was a big tsunami, by the way, in December 2004 here in Thailand. Yeah. And that one of the big issues about it that was quite remarkable is the animals in Phuket, especially the elephants, started acting very, very strangely. That in fact, the elephants broke loose from their moorings and their chains, and the animal trainers followed them right up into the hills. There was also part of the story is that there was an elephant that was up there with his trainer in the hill, and the trainer wanted to take him back to the base. The elephant would not go. He was very, very slow. He was very trepidatious, you know, very slow, not wanting to go, resisting, wanting to take another path, all that kind of stuff. And after a short time of this behavior, all of the other elephants from the pack came up there with him. And this elephant, even with the trainer on his back, turns around and goes up the hill with the rest of the elephants. Okay, so everybody, yeah, they feel it in their feet. They could— they knew, and other animals, they know. But, but humans not paying any attention to what's going on. We're too busy thinking about all of our problems to not recognize that the whole ground is shaking up from under us. We need to go to a high ground. Okay, so here's where we can say that it's not the tsunami that was Dukkha. That when, when Phuket got wiped out from that and all those people died, it wasn't the tsunami that killed them. It was their ignorance. If they had been as smart as elephants, they'd have headed for the hills. It was not the tsunami that was Dukkha. It was ignorance of the tsunami. That was the Dukkha. Not seeing it. Okay, so that's why Dukkha is— that's why we talk about wisdom is being able to see the dangers before it gets there, so that we can do something in advance. We can take a hike, we can go up the hill with the elephants. We don't have to stand on the shore and get flooded.

**Speaker A:** Like earlier and earlier, like every time you get like better at the practice, you can recognize even earlier, right?

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. And what do we mean by that earlier is now we're looking at it in the sense of Paticcasamuppada. And you've probably heard, or at least I'll tell you now, that we have to know it forwards and backwards. Forwards, it's taught forward. So that we can see that this causes that, causes this, causes that. But that's the sequence in time, that this happens before that, and then that happens before the next thing. So how we practice Paticcasamuppada is not in forward order, we practice it in reverse order.

**Speaker A:** What did I think about that made me do this? And Yeah, that you retrace the Dukkha, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. So the beginning student, the first thing that he has to learn is this is Dukkha. He's in it. And then later he begins to see, oh, this is the cause of Dukkha. This is how I wind up in that state. And that's when we're at the level of the wolf states and Upadana. And clinging. And then as we get better at it, we wind up saying, oh, it's not the clinging and it's not the Dukkha, it's the fact that I feel, my feelings of wanting something ignorantly. And then later we back up even further to say, oh, well, I felt that way because of the way that I thought in the first place, that my perception was wrong. If I had perceived things correctly, then I wouldn't have wound up going in the direction of my feelings taking me into Dukkha. So you're exactly right. This is what wisdom is all about, is catching things earlier and earlier and seeing which way they're headed so that we can make a change. That's the entire teaching of the Buddha right there, is quicker and quicker we can see what's going on so that we can see it through wisdom, recognize how things are headed and make a change before they get there. We point our guns in the correct direction before they go off, not after. We point our mind in the correct position so that when our mouth goes off, we don't hurt anybody. And so this is wisdom for you. That's a really clear definition of wisdom. Can you see Dukkha in advance? Can you see it as it's coming along before you step in? Can you see that cow pie and then not step in it? Or can you see that insult flying in your direction and you stand out of the way so that it doesn't hit you? Oh, you missed me. That's not who I am.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so the slings of arrows of outrageous fortune never hit you because you're fast enough to stand right out of the way and not get hit with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think, uh, it's time to Drop the knowledge and start to understand the wisdom even more.

**Speaker B:** Right. Start to recognize, now I know what wisdom is. Now I know that I got to look, because if I look and I can see what's going on now, I can make changes before things go south. But we practice that from the very beginning, by after the mind is already in hindrances, after we're already tired, after we're already messed up. Up. Now let's look at what got us there so that next time when we're in that state, we don't have to go any further. We can interrupt someplace along the way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe you just feel like this light clinging and not like the full-on next level of Dukkha. And then we can— it's like so more subtle, right? And then you feel like a sensation, even more like slight Maybe, uh, then you— so, and is this like an earlier step? Um, maybe we can talk about this next time, uh, like, okay, um, because I've got to go to work. And, uh, but, uh, sometimes, you know, you, you feel like a really strong Dukkha, and you're like, your mind is— and sometimes you just feel like a tendency, like a slight emotional reaction. And I was wondering, maybe this is like clinging, and then when there is the strong Dukkha, maybe it's clinging plus the next step, you know. And is the feeling level Yeah, well, I think I know the answer. Like, everything you feel is on the feeling plane, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. This— so this is the practice, is that we can see it, beginning to see it quicker and quicker. We begin to notice that if I hold my mind pointing in that direction, that I can do damage, that I need to change the mind. Or change the focus or change the direction where the mind is pointed. Or like I said with the gun, you got to watch where the gun is pointed because that's where things are going to get attacked when the trigger is pulled. And we can't tell for sure when the trigger is going to get pulled, but we can keep track of which way things are pointed. And so that's just an analogy for start looking at the kind of thoughts that we have, because those thoughts give us the feelings. And we're already beginning to change our thoughts. We're beginning to see the wholesome thoughts, knowing what they are. And now we can begin to also see when things are going in the direction of getting unwholesome. We can catch that. Yeah, you come back into a wholesome state.

**Speaker A:** That's good.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's finish this conversation. I think that this has been a really interesting point about, uh, just enough data.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you do not know how to test battle every rifle in the world. All we need to know is Which direction is that gun pointing?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, how to use it. All right, all right, thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll see you. Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. See you.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with contributions from a Sangha friend (Speaker A), centers on a crucial shift in approach to Buddhist practice: moving from accumulating intellectual knowledge to developing practical wisdom through direct observation and skill.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Pitfall of "Knowledge Craving":** The talk begins by critiquing the common tendency, especially among Western practitioners, to approach the Dhamma as an intellectual pursuit—constantly reading suttas, seeking new teachings, and gathering data. This is compared to a carpentry student who watches a master and says "I understand," but cannot yet produce the work. The danger is mistaking information for skill development.

**2. "Just Enough" for Correct Practice:** The core message is that we don't need an endless pile of information. We need **"just enough"**—the essential instructions for correct practice—and then we must **practice repeatedly**. The Eightfold Noble Path is presented as this complete foundational instruction. The goal is to go deep with a few essential tools rather than wide with endless data.

**3. The One Essential Knowledge: Dukkha:** The talk distills the practice down to one supreme knowledge: the knowledge of **Dukkha** (suffering/stress/unsatisfactoriness). Understanding Dukkha is likened to knowing "fire is hot—don't touch it." We don't need to analyze every burn; we need to recognize the nature of fire (Dukkha) in its many forms and learn to avoid it. The entire path is about developing the skill to see Dukkha earlier and earlier in its causal chain.

**4. Wisdom vs. Rules: The Example of Tiredness:** A significant portion discusses the hindrance of tiredness in meditation. The talk criticizes rigid retreat rules that ignore fatigue. **Wisdom** means observing your state: a tired mind is prone to Dukkha and dangerous, just like driving tired. The correct practice is to adapt—take a walk, rub your limbs, or even nap—to restore a gladdened, fit mind. This illustrates how wisdom must override blind rule-following.

**5. Wisdom Defined as Seeing Direction:** A powerful analogy is offered: **Wisdom is seeing where things are headed.** Just as you must always be aware of where a gun is pointed (because that's where the bullet will go), wisdom is seeing the direction of your thoughts, emotions, and situations. Can you see an argument is leading to anger? Can you see a thought pattern is leading to sadness? Seeing the direction allows you to change course *before* the "trigger is pulled" and full-blown Dukkha arises.

**6. Progressive Practice: Catching Dukkha Earlier:** The practice is framed as a progressive refinement of this wisdom. Beginners see Dukkha only after it's fully arisen (like "hitting rock bottom"). With practice, you learn to spot it in the clinging (**upādāna**) that leads to it, then in the feelings (**vedanā**) that lead to clinging, and even earlier in the perceptions (**saññā**) and thoughts. The goal is to intercept the causal chain (**paṭiccasamuppāda**) as early as possible.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a call to move from being a "scholar" of the Dhamma to being a "craftsperson." Stop craving more information. Use the essential instructions you already have. Practice observing the mind and body to develop the core skill: the wisdom to see Dukkha and its causes as they begin to form, and to skillfully redirect the mind toward wholesomeness and ease. The ultimate point is simple: **"Don't worry, be happy,"** which is achieved not by adding more, but by letting go and seeing clearly what is already happening.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker B (the teacher) to illustrate the core teachings:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **The Carpenter/Apprentice:**
    *   **Story:** A student watches a master carpenter create a beautiful product and thinks he intellectually understands. But when he tries, it doesn't work. This illustrates the gap between intellectual knowledge and experiential skill.
    *   **Purpose:** To criticize the pursuit of endless Buddhist scholarship (reading sutras, visiting gurus) without deep practice, comparing it to an apprentice who wants to know every tool but hasn't learned to *do* anything.

2.  **The Hot Stove/Burner:**
    *   **Story:** You lean on a new, red-hot stove you didn't recognize and burn your hand. The essential knowledge isn't examining every burn mark, but learning: "Fire is hot. Don't put your hand in it."
    *   **Purpose:** To define the one essential knowledge needed: recognizing **Dukkha (suffering/stress)**. We don't need to analyze every nuance of suffering; we need to develop the skill to see it and avoid it.

3.  **The Airplane in a Nosedive / Hitting Rock Bottom:**
    *   **Story:** A pilot in a nosedive doesn't recognize the full danger until he "hits rock bottom" (crashes). An alcoholic only sees the Dukkha clearly at "rock bottom."
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast unskillful and skillful practice. The goal of practice is **not** to crash into major suffering, but to become like a wise pilot who sees the nosedive (the small, early signs of Dukkha) and corrects it long before impact.

4.  **Pointing a Gun:**
    *   **Story:** On a gun range or hunt, the cardinal rule is to always be mindful of where the barrel is pointed, because that's where the bullet will go if it fires. The speaker shares a personal story of an old hunter carelessly pointing a shotgun at people's knees.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a "really clear definition of wisdom." Wisdom is seeing **"which way things are pointed"**—observing the direction of your thoughts, words, and actions *before* they "go off" and cause harm. It's about trajectory, not just outcomes.

5.  **Driving While Tired:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker shares a personal experience of driving tired, feeling the car start to whirl, and realizing he must stop. He compares this to meditating with a tired mind.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue against rigidly following meditation "rules" (like sitting through all sessions). A tired mind is prone to Dukkha and is "dangerous," just like a tired driver. Correct practice (wisdom) is to recognize the hindrance and address it (rest, walk, nap), not to ignore it.

6.  **The 2004 Tsunami and the Elephants:**
    *   **Story:** During the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, elephants in Phuket sensed the danger, broke their chains, and fled to high ground, even resisting handlers who tried to lead them back.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that Dukkha is **not inherent in the world or events** (like a tsunami). The Dukkha was human **ignorance** of the signs. Wisdom is being "as smart as elephants"—attentive to the present moment to see danger approaching and act skillfully.

### **Supporting Metaphors & Short Analogies:**

*   **"Just a little dab will do us":** A saying (from an old commercial) used to argue we need only a little correct information (the Eightfold Path), not piles of data.
*   **Learning Piano as a Child:** The speaker wanted to play advanced music like the older kids, but this meant he skipped the basics from simpler pieces. This parallels meditation students who want advanced "data" instead of mastering fundamentals.
*   **The Additive Model of Religion/Culture:** Like a banker who is "better" for having more money, people think they need "more" religion, more attainment, more joy—importing this consumer mindset to Buddhism.
*   **Stepping in a Cow Pie:** A quick analogy for seeing Dukkha in advance: wisdom is seeing the cow pie and not stepping in it.
*   **"Slings and Arrows of Outrageous Fortune":** A reference to Shakespeare (*Hamlet*). With wisdom, you become fast enough to "stand out of the way" of insults and misfortune so they don't hit you.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose:**
The metaphors consistently build a central argument: **True Buddhist practice is not about accumulating intellectual knowledge ("gathering stuff"), but about developing the practical wisdom to see the earliest signs of suffering (Dukkha) in your own mind and life, and skillfully changing course.** It's about moving from being a scholar in the carpenter's shed to becoming the master craftsperson; from being the driver who crashes while tired to the one who pulls over; from being the person who gets hit by the tsunami to the one who heads for the hills with the elephants.
