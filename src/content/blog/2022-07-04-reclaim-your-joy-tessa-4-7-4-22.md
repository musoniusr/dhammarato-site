### Transcript


**Speaker A:** If you can't remember to smile, I can't. Okay, that's part of the Sati. Can you remember to smile?

**Speaker B:** No, I couldn't on those two days.

**Speaker A:** So you can't. So you're saying that you can see the, uh, the unwholesome thoughts, but you're not waking them up? You're not waking up to them, rather?

**Speaker B:** I mean, I see them, but I see them.

**Speaker A:** But you see them with the same old eyes.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** You see them with the same child eyes that you've always seen through them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's not Sati. Okay, because Sati is the waking up so that we can see it as it is with discernment and put together that you're not a little girl anymore. You're a big grown lady. In fact, I've been busted for using the word because it's too grown up.

**Speaker B:** I'm, you know, getting older and realizing I don't actually have the potential I thought I had. So that bums me out. And then when I try to— I don't know how to make this wholesome because when I just I don't know what to change it to. I don't know what to do with it.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll go ahead and add our friend. To see if she answers. Okay, so let's remember to smile until she answers so that you'll have a smile when she does.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, what we were having to talk about is you're saying that you now are claiming you don't know how to be happy, that in fact you were using it. So the thought that I came up with was you can't teach an old dog new tricks. And you're seeing yourself as an old dog now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, guess what? We don't want to teach you new tricks. We want you to become a puppy again. You already been through the puppy phase, so you know how to be a puppy.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, you were a little kid. Before you were trained in the methods that you live now, you were a little kid that had joy. Every child is joyful. Every child loves to play. The number one thing that a child does when they're 2, 18 months, is learn to play. Right? Do you remember that time for yourself? Do you have any old memories of the time when you were a little kid? Little girl?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you do. Uh-huh. When you said you do, I noticed a little smile.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do. I remember playing when I was younger.

**Speaker A:** Okay, can you remember it with relish?

**Speaker B:** I mean, it makes me— Can you.

**Speaker A:** Remember how you felt when you were playing? As a little girl?

**Speaker B:** Not that well.

**Speaker A:** Well, can you enjoy thinking about how good you realize that she did feel, even if you can't feel that good right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So you know— okay, there that little smile is again. All right, so let's practice with that. Let's keep going with it. So you know that this little girl once upon a time had joy in her life. Yeah, yeah, she played with her toys, she learned to walk. Yeah, yeah. What kind of little toys did you play with back then?

**Speaker B:** Dolls and, you know, fake house stuff.

**Speaker A:** Like, now I'm seeing a bigger smile.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you remember one of the dolls?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And how about stuffed animals, stuffed toys, teddy bear? How old is that one?

**Speaker B:** Oh, this one's like, uh, gosh, maybe 7 years old.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Did— does it remind you of one that you had when you were 2 years old?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we're going to be using that— what's his name?

**Speaker B:** Polar bear.

**Speaker A:** Huh? Polar bear. That's his name. Okay, he's a bear. Yeah, yeah, he's a teddy bear, polar style.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, so we're going to play with the bear, the polar bear. He's our friend. So every time that you see that polar bear, you're going to remember him as your friend.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that this bear has all the knowledge of how good you felt when you played with the other bear, Polar Bear Number 1, who was there when you were having so much fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah. So you have a polar bear now. You have something to remember, to remind yourself that you could feel okay now. You could feel the way that you felt when you were a little girl, or at least the way you remember that she felt.

**Speaker B:** But when I do that, a lot of bad memories come up with it.

**Speaker A:** Well, and as soon as they do, you'll push those right back out again and stay with the memories of the good times. This is the whole point, is yes, the old memories, because you spent so much time remembering the old bad memories, and it's time for you to stop and start thinking about the best times that did happen. Okay, that you're— yeah, because it was all a mix, and here you have chosen the dark side of the mix rather than the bright side of the mix.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But since it was a mix, you're doing the choosing, and you're doing the choosing every moment. You choose what to put in your mind.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I've spent a lot of years in therapy about childhood stuff, and that brings up all the negative stuff, and now I'm worried I'm too mired in the negative to fix it ever.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, uh, the therapist should have in fact worked with you on that. Therapists know all about this stuff. They call it psychological archaeology, but many of the therapists use it in the sense of trying to find the villain. OK. And they often do. In fact, one of my jokes is that this psychopath got ordered into psychotherapy from the court, and there he is in his psychotherapy session. And he has to do this psychological stuff. And meanwhile, he's already identified as and calls himself an.

**Speaker B:** Asshole.

**Speaker A:** And so he gets into her memory with the psychologist is that all He got a spanking when he was 4 years old. He got a really, really big spanking, and ever since then he's been this asshole. And so he and the psychotherapist say, yeah, that's it, that's— that was the trauma that caused all of this. Okay, but neither one of them figured out that maybe he got a spanking because he was being an.

**Speaker B:** Asshole.

**Speaker A:** In other words, they may have not been digging deep enough. They came to a conclusion and it didn't even help. So what's the point of the psychological archaeology if it's not going to be doing the repair that needs to be done?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like, I mean, I have improved over the years, but I've also become really negative.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's an improvement, huh?

**Speaker B:** That's not an improvement. No, that's not one of the improvements.

**Speaker A:** Okay, if you don't mind, I've got a puppy that wants to play and is biting both my fingers and my toes. I think you've already seen her. It's— here she is. This is Panda.

**Speaker B:** Hi, Panda!

**Speaker A:** And she is really feisty right now. She is really— see, there she goes, starting to bite again. So I'm going to go put her down. I'll be right back.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So I put her down on the floor and closed the door, as opposed to just putting her down. That's not the way that I expected it to come out, but I heard what happened.

**Speaker B:** So it's really cute.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yes, she's, uh, growing into 8 weeks now, and, uh, that I, I'm the only one in the house that really plays with her, and so she gets really feisty, and so I'll take the teddy bears or some cloth or something and play with her very strenuously, because she needs to do that. Then in fact, I originally thought that she was a Jack Russell Terrier. The terrier is really strong. Then in fact, I think she's more— I think of her now as a Rat Terrier, because she really claws, she really digs. I mean, she's a very, very active little puppy. So, um, when I see puppies like this, it actually reminds me of all the, uh, human childhood stages. Dogs go through the same stages as humans do, just a little more rapidly. Okay, and so, uh, She's in that heavy oral stage right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Which for humans is when the kid will put anything in his mouth.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So in any case, I can understand that the approach that we're taking here, you've actually been down that way and had some lack of success with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But there's certainly— yeah, yeah. All right, well, we can in fact, uh, use that still to capitalize on the fact that you know that you have felt good in your past, and so that you're actually now rediscovering something that you already have, as opposed to an old dog trying to learn a new trick. Okay, okay. This is an important point, that the archaeological, uh, psychological archaeology that you've done only dug up things that, um, let us say, might belong in a museum, but they're not golden yet. Do we have it struck gold? Yeah. And what do I mean by that? The delight of a child. Yeah, to allow yourself to become delighted.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I want that back.

**Speaker A:** Well, all you have to do is start allowing yourself to feel it, because you already know how to feel delighted. Here you're all getting sad. Oh, poor me, I used to have it and now I've lost it.

**Speaker B:** But I feel like I don't deserve it because I haven't achieved anything important.

**Speaker A:** Well, you don't have to achieve anything other than being delighted. How much achievement did you have to do to feel delighted in the first place?

**Speaker B:** Nothing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now you have permission to do nothing and still feel delighted. In fact, you can feel robbed. I'd rather you feel robbed.

**Speaker B:** Feel robbed instead of delighted?

**Speaker A:** No, to feel robbed rather than feel like I have to get something that that I lost. Then in fact, you weren't actually so much that you lost it, it's that you were robbed of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you don't have to work hard to get it back, that all you could do is just reclaim your stolen property, which is right there in front of you. And it's that easy. Okay, so say it's that easy. Is it that easy to just take a deep breath and recognize it's okay to be delighted right now?

**Speaker B:** Okay to be delighted right now.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. And I see just a hint of a smile, not as much as the smile that we had when you talked about your dolls and your dollhouse.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now there you go again. It's the dollhouse, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's the dolls.

**Speaker A:** It's the dolls in the dollhouse. Okay, so recognize right now that you have delight just thinking about it again.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you can have delight. You've had it many times, and then you were told that you can't have it anymore. You were robbed of it. Not only robbed, but you have to pay a ransom to get it back. Yeah, yeah. Funny how this society treats its children.

**Speaker B:** I do feel that way. I have to pay ransom to get back joy. I have to achieve to feel happy, and I don't— I don't deserve to feel happy if I don't achieve.

**Speaker A:** Did you feel that way when you were in college?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, do you think that a lot of the students in college felt that way?

**Speaker B:** Very possibly, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and they didn't tell you about it, but everybody went around feeling robbed. That's why they're in college, because they're part— they're paying off the ransom.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I still feel like this is hard to do though, and I know that's a hindrance itself, but I still feel like it is hard.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the feeling. Yeah. Okay, that gives voice to the hard. All right, so let's look at the feeling itself. And then with investigation, you can recognize that the feeling itself is not necessarily attached to that negative language, that we can in fact nourish ourselves. Oh, poor baby, you've been robbed. Yeah, yeah, we can begin to change our attitude from the anger of being robbed and know that you've got to pay the ransom back and you don't like that into being tender with yourself and recognize that, yeah, you've been robbed, but you're not going to get— you're not going to get your joy and your delight and your childhood, um, feeling of being on top of the world by paying the ransom. You've been paying the ransom all these years And the ransom hasn't worked. At least it only works temporarily. This is in fact what the Second Noble Truth is really all about, is that we have been told, we've been lied to, to say that if you stomp out all the bad things that you don't like and you gather up all the things that you do like, then you'll find happiness someplace in there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And now you spend all your time grasping and clinging and getting, or stomping things out, and you're not enjoying doing that. You've come pretty good at it. So the question is, why don't you just continue to stomp out the bad things that you don't like, but do it with delight? Haha, I got you! Because now with that, we can begin to do it the Buddha's way, is, aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I got you. That in fact, what we're really talking about now is beginning to make friends with yourself on the inside.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was trying to do that today. Like I would I'd say, "I see you, Mara, that's not true." But I would still cry.

**Speaker A:** You still cried anyway. Did you enjoy the crying?

**Speaker B:** Mostly not, no. There was like a moment where I did, but it was very short.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's go back and look at that moment. Okay, so there was actually a part of it that you actually enjoyed crying. So it was actually not the crying itself that's the issue, it's whether you were enjoying yourself when you were doing it or not. And there was a mix. Look at that, another mixed bag.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there was a moment where I got really into it and it was very cathartic feeling. That was short-lived, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so maybe then the purging that you're talking about is not so much a purge, is that when you change the pain into delight, that you actually enjoyed the purge, you let it all out because you could let it all out and it felt good to let it all out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I was— the real change.

**Speaker A:** Was is that you let yourself feel good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because when I was a kid, I wasn't supposed to cry, so it felt good to do it.

**Speaker A:** I could cry if I want. It's my party. I could cry if I want to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Who was that one? I don't— I don't know, maybe.

**Speaker B:** But I, I tap danced to that song when I was like 5 or 6 in a group.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we've got a really— and I'll cry if I want to. All right, so we've got an anchor for you now. That's your song. Okay, okay. We need to start singing that song whenever you feel like crying. Okay, because you remember the dance and you remember that you cheered yourself up, and you could cheer yourself up again with that song. Yeah, but I often talk to students about using music and mention a whole lot of tunes. This is the first time that I've used that one for obvious reasons, but I even talk about the James Brown meditation.

**Speaker B:** What's that?

**Speaker A:** James Brown?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know, I know James Brown.

**Speaker A:** But what do you— you know that he danced all around the stage? He really enjoyed himself. All right, and that not only that, but he was Al Sharpton's mentor. Some of the best aspects of Al Sharpton I can see because he got that from James Brown. And one of James Brown's songs is 'I Feel Good.'.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I got it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you smile. So that one will be another one for you. But it's my party and I could cry if I want to. And then the next song is 'And I Feel Good.' Yeah, so we can actually begin to remember and use these songs as anchors. Or if you really, really want to get Hindu about it, we can use these songs as mantras. Yeah, yeah, it's my party, I can cry if I want to. Yeah, and then you can go ahead and cry all you want to and enjoy the heck out of it. I feel good when I'm crying.

**Speaker B:** So you can still cry but be happy?

**Speaker A:** Well, you said so yourself. This is not my observation, it's your own. This is your reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess so.

**Speaker A:** All right, so it's your party. That's, that's an important part. In fact, that's the important thing. Not only is it your party, you could do anything you want to, including not cry. You can squeal with delight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I want less crying.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, it's your party.

**Speaker B:** I don't feel like I have that control though, because I was— Well, we.

**Speaker A:** Can start with this: my party, I can cry if I want to then. And let's start with at least you can cry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I can definitely do that.

**Speaker A:** One Little Step at a Time is my party, and I can cry if I want to.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Cry if I want to, die if I want to, I think is the next line. You would cry too if this happened to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. That's the song.

**Speaker A:** All right, so now you've got some joy. Let's use this joy because you know that you have it. You had it when you danced at the age of 5, so you hadn't lost it completely. You were probably better at it at the age of 2, but even by the age of 5 they hadn't stomped it out of you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. We— I did. I was the— I missed one of the classes, so I thought we were doing a little cheer at the end, and— but then I was the only one who did it out of the whole troupe because I'd missed it.

**Speaker A:** Well, let me hear that cheer now. Okay, it's my party and I can cry if I want to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, that's the cheer.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we've got some place to go with this now. Uh-huh. That you can begin to change your mind. You can add things to it. This— we can use this as a mantra. The only question is, can you remember it to to apply it with the same gusto that we're doing it today?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can.

**Speaker A:** All right. In fact, you may want to start singing that song right out loud with a great big woo at the end. Go ahead and put some effort into it. Right, do it now.

**Speaker B:** It's my party and I'll cry if I want. To cry if I want to, cry if I want to. You would cry too if it happened to you. Yeah, yeah, I think I can do that.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, this is the value of, uh, of psychological archaeology, is not to go look what happened that caused all the trouble But let's go back and recognize that it wasn't all trouble, that you did have something then that you won't give yourself now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I did. Yeah, I was happy a lot as a kid, actually, now that I think about it.

**Speaker A:** Wow, isn't that marvelous? You didn't want to think about it 30 minutes ago, 10 minutes ago.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, yes, I spent so much time in therapy just talking about all the bad stuff. Right.

**Speaker A:** You know why? Because the therapist is still thinking about all the bad stuff that happened to them. When they get over that, they can invite you into all the good stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** We have to do that one little thought at a time, and then we remember to wake up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I feel like I, yeah, I mean, I had a lot of mindfulness today and Thursday while I was crying, but all of the wholesome thoughts just, they didn't stick. They felt, they felt like I was just lying to myself and I just wanted to cry, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's okay. I cry too.

**Speaker B:** I just felt like crying a lot. Yeah, I cry.

**Speaker A:** Some of the most beautiful music in the world, I mean, there's nothing to do with it but cry. Especially pieces like Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony, the Pathétique. I mean, the whole piece of music is disastrous. You're supposed to cry. Enjoy yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I do like to cry sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Well, enjoy it then.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's okay to cry and enjoy it. Yeah, it hurts so bad it feels good.

**Speaker B:** I guess I felt like— I guess, I guess a part of me feels like it's not okay to cry, so I shouldn't be doing it, and then there's a conflict. Because I want to cry, but then a part of me says, no, that's— you're a wimp, stop being a wimp.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Well, you've got a lot of rules. Yeah, fine. You've got a lot of shoulds, you've got a lot of standards that you have given yourself that you can't meet up to. Yeah, funny how preachers do that to their audience at church. Yeah, the preachers will give the people rules and standards that they're supposed to live up to, but he doesn't have to. They go home and they teach those rules and those laws to their kids and tell the kids, you got to live up to all of these standards, but we don't have to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was raised Catholic, so there were rules, rules for that too.

**Speaker A:** Right? Well, guess what? This is called hypocrisy. Do as I say, don't do as I do. Then in fact, in a way, that's what's wrong with Buddhism. Modern Western Buddhism would rather do as the Buddha did before he became enlightened, rather than following the instructions of actually how to do it. But when we are actually out there telling people to secretly— I'm telling them all, even if I still get angry a lot, I'll tell people to don't get angry, or whatever the Christian preacher is telling them. In other words, this is the hypocrisy. The problem with hypocrisy is that even though we have been able to shovel this rule off onto someone else so that I don't have to keep it myself— I mean, these rules came, they say, from God. If the rule comes from God, that means that I've got to pass it on down, but along the way I can not so much as touch it. But the problem with that is, is that we always wind up feeling guilty for telling people to do things that we don't do ourselves. And so nobody then is free from the misery, whether they're following the rules or not. Yeah, yeah. Then in fact, those who follow the rules, uh, there's a word for it, perhaps you've heard it before. It's called goody-two-shoes. Yeah, okay. And the goody-two-shoes is one who follows all of the rules and they're still miserable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I tried to follow all the rules. I mean, I still do all my rules. I try to follow all my rules, but then I just feel bad because I don't, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, you learned those rules from someplace else. They left them around for you to pick up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** One of the many of them were shoved down your throat.

**Speaker B:** No, I know, like, don't be happy until you achieve something. Unless you achieve something, don't be happy. You don't deserve it. That was the messaging.

**Speaker A:** Well, you have heard of the concept of Sunyata. Or Sunyata.

**Speaker B:** I don't know what that is though.

**Speaker A:** That's the Pali word that means emptiness or nothingness, and that things are actually empty of meaning, they're empty of purpose. And as humans that give purpose and meaning to things, and sometimes they try to make things really, really important by story, but the reality is, is that there's really nothing to it. That in fact, this is a way of saying that there's really nothing to feeling bad, and there's nothing really to feeling good. Your choice, but there's really nothing to it. It's nothing to it when you have learned to feel bad, and every time you feel bad, it's really easy to do. There's nothing to it. But through right effort Through right effort, you can in fact change that so that you could feel really good. And when you get into the habit of feeling really good, then there's nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** So I can feel bad if I want to?

**Speaker A:** You can feel bad if you want to, and you can feel good if you want to. Recognize that right now, feeling bad is your default position.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it really is. I like— I have a lot of, um, like, my heart has felt heavy today and Thursday when I was crying. I don't like that feeling, but there's.

**Speaker A:** Like— well, did you breathe into it? If you don't like it, that's what we do, is we breathe right into it. Why is that? Because that'll start controlling it. That in fact, if it feels heavy on the chest, that is saying, okay, that means you can't breathe. I won't let you. I'm being heavy for you now. And here you go saying, oh yes, I can breathe. Why should we do it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it would lessen throughout the day and then come back. It would leave, come back, leave, come back. I don't like this pattern of things leaving and coming back. I don't want them coming back. I just want them to leave forever.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know. Guess what? The world spins. Can you imagine that the world was not spinning, that it was laying flat like a pancake? I mean, there are some people who believe that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Flat Earthers, right?

**Speaker A:** And they have to contort and twist all kinds of reality to get that state. But the point that we're making is that things are on a cycle. All kinds of things are on a cycle. I mean, tricadas are on a cycle, the moon is on a cycle, the sun is on a cycle. They call it solar cycles, sunspots. The Earth is on a cycle. Trees are on a cycle. That's why they're called deciduous, is because they have rings in there to look at those cycles. Every year the trees go through cycles. Everything goes through cycles.

**Speaker B:** I felt like I had an insight into impermanence, like maybe a couple days ago. But it didn't stick because today I had the heaviness return and leave and return and leave and I got upset about it. So I don't understand. When I meditate, sometimes I feel like I have insights, but then those insights don't— they don't just translate to, oh.

**Speaker A:** Now my life— they're not going to translate to, but what they will allow you to do is to have that insight again and again and again and again. Okay, over and over again.

**Speaker B:** I just want one insight and then nothing bad ever happens again.

**Speaker A:** I know, and you will make progress as soon as you get over that and recognize that you're going to have to keep putting some effort in it. Happy effort.

**Speaker B:** I don't feel like it's happy effort. I mean, sometimes I do, but I don't know.

**Speaker A:** If you put happy effort into it, then it's not so bad. But if you put heavy-duty effort into it, then oh no, that's too much.

**Speaker B:** I put heavy-duty effort into it.

**Speaker A:** I know, I've been watching.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah. What's light effort? What is light happy effort then compared to what I'm doing?

**Speaker A:** Well, partly we're developing the attitude that you can do this. And you need a little bit of that. We can call it mojo juice. Then in fact, I did one time, it blew me away when I actually found in the Pali this word mojo, and it actually means what we think it means today.

**Speaker B:** Wait, really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a Pali word, mojo.

**Speaker B:** Is that where it came from?

**Speaker A:** Is that the— I don't know, it's just, it may be a coincidence, but it's, it really was funny, it was humorous. It's on some video for years ago. But anyway, mojo. Get your mojo going. All right, yeah, this is where James Brown— remember James Brown? Remember, it's my party, I can cry if I want to. Yeah, okay, that gives you back the feeling of being in control. It's your party now. Yeah, so you've been feeling out of control all of these years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Which is my emotions. Yeah, yeah. And I have been very much in the victim mentality. Still am though, because I'm waiting, you know, wanting everything to go away permanently.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. That's what victims do. Champions say, let me at him, hold my beer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yeah, that's the attitude that we're going to start developing for all of these negative feelings when they come up. Is it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, we start with, it's my party. It's my party. You're in charge here.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We've got that one. That's our anchor.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Are you going to have a pity party? I mean, it's your choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do like pity parties sometimes.

**Speaker A:** I know. Yeah. That's why you called.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I like them sometimes, but other times I don't like them, and it's still in my head, all these unwholesome thoughts, like the potential thing, and then I have to achieve to be happy. That one keeps coming back a lot.

**Speaker A:** Say it again.

**Speaker B:** Like that I have no potential, but I have to achieve to be happy, but I can't achieve, so I'll never be happy.

**Speaker A:** And the next thought is, I'm so lazy. No, the next thought is, it's my party.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so maybe it's my party and I can cry if I want to is not a solidly green thought like a kelly green. It's more like a chartreuse. Or maybe yellow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but at least it puts the control back.

**Speaker A:** But you're taking control and you're shifting it out of that dark red. Yeah, it is your party. So that's the way that you begin to think, that when these really heavy negative thoughts come, wakey wakey, see them as heavy duty and recognize you can light them right up by saying, it's my party.

**Speaker B:** Do I need to replace the negative thoughts with positive ones?

**Speaker A:** That's what the Buddha recommends in dozens of suttas.

**Speaker B:** I don't know sometimes what to change the thoughts to.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can change it to, "Hey, I don't have to think about that.".

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Are then— and guess what? When you have that thought, you've just changed what it was. Or, aha, I see you, Mara, is already a change.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and you have the ability to, to have whatever thought you want to have in your mind. And you can get that from someone talking to you. You could get that from things that you see, or they can be things that you just dream up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so what we recommend is to not only to come out of the heavy dreaming, let's start adding the dreams to reality. And wake up into reality, into the things you see, the things you hear, and comment on them by taking a deep breath and commenting on, wow, I'm glad I'm still breathing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's the way you ask the question, I don't know what to change the thoughts into. Now we've got a whole bag full. Right now is a big, big bag full of new thoughts to have.

**Speaker B:** So whenever emotions come up, it's because I have thoughts that are negative that create them rather than the old emotions coming up for purging? Because there's that concept talked about a lot about how to purge old emotions. Is that not that you're saying, why don't just kill them?

**Speaker A:** What do you mean by the word purge?

**Speaker B:** Like if you cry, you're getting maybe negative energy out of yourself or opening up a block.

**Speaker A:** And maybe when you're crying, you're not getting rid of it. You're not purging it. You're just wallowing in it. Purging means to drain the swamp, not drown in it. Okay, okay. So we have to look at the word purge here, and the thing that we're doing is— aha, I see you, Mara— is a kind of a purge right then and there. Okay, okay. In other words, having a bigger pity party is not going to stop pity parties. Okay, that doesn't purge pity party. It in fact gives you, uh, even more habit, even grinding it in deeper. Okay, so we have to understand that yes, we are going to purge, but we're not going to purge anger by getting even more angry. But in fact, that, uh, there's a story about that one. It got started with Fritz Perls. Have you ever heard of Fritz Perls?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Fritz Perls was in Esalen Institute, and he had a style called Gestalt therapy that he used a client and another chair, an empty chair, and the client would have conversations with the empty chair. The last reference that I saw to it was Clint Eastwood in the 2016 election, when he actually put Obama in the other chair. OK, and then he had his own conversation, but that then eventually led to people taking pillows and bashing the pillow on the floor, and then it ripened altogether into encounter groups and encounter therapies. They even invented an industry around it that had to do with boxing gloves and big padded helmets that looked like you were in a boxing ring, and batons that were very, very heavily padded and that kind of stuff, so that people could have at it with each other. This is back in the '70s. This was during my training years. And What happened was, is that they were getting people angry in therapy, trying to purge it out. These people would go home and beat their wives.

**Speaker B:** Oh, great.

**Speaker A:** Oh, great. Exactly. Purging again. Yeah, purge with beating the pillow. And now you go home and actually beat up mommy. So they recognize that's not the right way to go. Purging has got a problem when you're actually over-escalating whatever bad feeling that you're talking about. Whether it's anger or a pity party or whatever. And so they stopped that kind of therapy. They don't do that anymore. That's 1970s. That's 50 years ago. And most Western adults in the United States are still living either the 50-year-old psychotherapy or they're just now learning it. But psycho— but the average human being is way behind what psychotherapy has gotten into now. They're getting into Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** Does this mean then that when I'm crying I should stop it?

**Speaker A:** No, I didn't say that. We know enjoying it.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point, is to change the way you're feeling. The Buddha mentions it most specifically in the Anapanasati Sutta, as well as well-known, this quality of Sukkha. Sukkha and Dukkha are opposites. Get yourself into a state of Sukkha, and we can talk ourselves into it. For instance, it's my party, I can cry if I want to, and now we've added just a little bit of joy to that, as opposed to, "Oh, poor me." Because the old poor me is, is that it's not really your pity party. You wouldn't choose a pity party if you had a choice about what kind of party you would have. You wouldn't have a choice of a pity party. Yeah. So by having that song, 'It's my party and I can cry if I want to,' means I can also change this pity party. I have that choice. But before, you didn't feel like that you had a choice. Yeah, I mean, you've got all of these rules and everything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like it happens to me for sure.

**Speaker A:** And now you're beginning to understand that you're the author of all of this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Now it just seems like it's connected to the heaviness in my chest because I— it feels heavy that I'm trying to breathe.

**Speaker A:** So that's a good time right now. Don't just point and talk about heaviness. That's the time to take a deep breath before you even mention it to me. When you feel that heaviness, breathe into it. There you go, that's a good one. Yeah, right. This is a— so see, That heaviness is not so heavy right now, is it? After just two deep breaths, it's not as heavy. Yeah, because now you're not thinking about, oh, poor me, how heavy this is. Now you're thinking about, I can take a deep breath and see what happens. A new thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is it. This is waking up. To remember to take a deep breath and to look at what we're doing. And that's it. Taking the effort to take that deep breath is the same effort that it takes to change your mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, I guess I forget a lot that I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you forget it often. So this is why we want to have Sati. Yeah, to remember, to remember, to remember, to remember. Because otherwise that negative thought will pop right back in. It's such a habit of doing that, and you have to be there ready for it, on guard, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you can do this. You can throw those negative thoughts out. Yeah, yeah, you can. That's it. See, you've already begun to change your attitude from the attitude of a victim. In the early part of the call, you couldn't do it. Now you're agreeing with me. Yes, you can.

**Speaker B:** So I just need you to tell me this every single moment of the day, and then we'll be good.

**Speaker A:** No, no, but twice, three times a week maybe, but not every minute of the day.

**Speaker B:** But then I forget because it's— because it's you reminding me that helps.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So I know that. I know that you have to— you have to get a push-off. Yeah, that's my job. My happy job is to keep pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing, and pretty soon you'll figure out that, hey, you could tell yourself the same thing that Dhammarato tells you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that you can feel good. It's your party.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us have a James Brown party. And you can say, I feel good.

**Speaker B:** I feel good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I feel good. I do feel good now. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so then the next step would be another song, which would be the spreading of that joy, which would be like Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog. You know that one?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Joy to the world, all the boys and girls now. Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me. Joy to you and me. Yes, that's it. Right. Okay, so the first one is, it's my party, I can cry if I want to, but now I feel good because that's the party I'm going to have, and then I can spread that joy with joy to the world.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Did you remember those three little songs?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's my party, I feel good, joy to the world. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And all of them are empowering. Take your power. We talked about the power last time. You have the power to do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have the power to do this. Yeah, I can do this. I forget that I can do this a lot though, and I feel like I don't have permission because I didn't achieve anything. And this pops up so much.

**Speaker A:** And when it does, you could pop it right back out. How do you pop it back out? It's my party, I'll cry if I want to.

**Speaker B:** Haha. Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, take it. That's how— when those thoughts come in that you feel out of control, take your control immediately.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Do the breath deep. Funny how this little stuff that we're talking about fits so carefully and precisely into the teachings of the Buddha. This is what he taught 2,500 years ago, is to remember to take a deep breath and enjoy the moment. That this is your party.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, so the fact that I'm old isn't going to prevent me from doing this?

**Speaker A:** No, not a bit, because this is not a new trick for an old dog. This is an old— this is an old trick this puppy's been using for years. I mean, don't you remember? It's my party, you can dance.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** So that's what you have to remember. It's my party, got to sing all the way through it. You would cry too if it happened to you. And then whoa, yeah, we gotta have that whoa at the end of it. Yeah, I know, just like, right, just what happened when you were 5 years old. That woo has to come out.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah. Yeah, I got this.

**Speaker A:** Okay, will you practice that and call me in a couple of days and we'll repeat this again? Okay, next time I expect to hear from you success instead of poor me.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, yes. All right, thank you.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you.

**Speaker A:** Have fun, it's your party.

**Speaker B:** I will, I will.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a compassionate and practical coaching session focused on overcoming persistent negative thoughts and reclaiming joy through Buddhist principles. The central student (Speaker B) is struggling with feelings of worthlessness, the belief that she must "achieve" to deserve happiness, and a heavy, cyclical sadness.

Here is a summary of the key themes and guidance offered:

**Core Problem:** Speaker B is stuck in a cycle of negative, self-critical thoughts ("I have no potential," "I must achieve to be happy") which lead to heavy emotions and crying spells. She feels like a victim of these states and has been mired in therapeutic work that focused on excavating past trauma without repairing it.

**Dhammarato's Guidance & Key Takeaways:**

1.  **From "Old Dog" to "Puppy":** He reframes her problem. She's not an "old dog" that can't learn new tricks. Instead, she needs to reconnect with the innate, playful **joy she had as a child**. The goal is to remember and reclaim a capacity she already possesses.

2.  **"It's Your Party" – Taking Back Control:** The central, practical tool offered is the mantra/song: **"It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to."** This is not to encourage crying, but to re-establish a sense of **agency and choice**. It shifts her from a passive victim ("this is happening to me") to the host of her own experience ("I can choose my response").

3.  **Psychological "Archaeology" for Gold, Not Trauma:** Dhammarato critiques therapy that only digs up painful memories ("finding the villain") without "striking gold"—which is **rediscovering the innate delight and good memories** from childhood. He guides her to consciously dwell on positive memories (playing with dolls, a polar bear teddy) to strengthen those neural pathways.

4.  **Sati (Mindfulness) as Waking Up:** True mindfulness isn't just seeing negative thoughts with the same old, defeated perspective. It is **"waking up" to them with discernment**—recognizing them as mere thoughts (calling them "Mara," the tempter) and choosing not to believe or be controlled by them.

5.  **Replace, Don't Just Wallow (The Right "Purge"):** The talk distinguishes between **wallowing** in emotion (which reinforces it) and **purging** it through skillful means. The skillful means is to **actively replace an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one** (e.g., "Aha, I see you, Mara!" or "It's my party!"). Crying is okay if you can **change your relationship to it** and find a cathartic joy in the release.

6.  **The Breath as the Anchor:** When heavy emotions arise (e.g., tightness in the chest), the immediate physical practice is to **"breathe into it."** This simple act of taking a deep breath is an act of control and investigation that can immediately lessen the heaviness and create space for a new thought.

7.  **Joy as a Habit, Not an Achievement:** Happiness doesn't require achievement. It is a permission slip you give yourself. The **Second Noble Truth** is referenced: the lie that happiness comes from stomping out the bad and grasping the good. True happiness comes from changing your relationship to experience.

8.  **Empowering Mantras:** A sequence of song mantras is suggested to cultivate and spread joy:
    *   **"It's my party..."** (to take control)
    *   **James Brown's "I Feel Good"** (to generate the feeling)
    *   **"Joy to the World" (Jeremiah was a Bullfrog)** (to spread the feeling)

**Conclusion:** The session moves Speaker B from a place of helplessness ("I can't remember to smile") to empowerment ("I got this"). The path forward is framed not as a heavy, effortful struggle, but as a **"happy effort"** of remembering her innate capacity for joy, using simple tools (breath, mantras, memories) to repeatedly wake up and choose a different thought, thereby hosting a better "party" for herself.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the speaker (A) uses several key metaphors and stories to guide the listener (B) from a state of negativity and feeling trapped to one of empowerment and joy. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **"Old Dog" vs. "Puppy" / "Little Girl" vs. "Grown Lady":**
    *   **Problem Frame:** B sees herself as an "old dog" who can't learn "new tricks" (new ways to be happy).
    *   **Solution Frame:** A reframes it: the goal isn't to learn something new, but to **reconnect with the "puppy" or the joyful "little girl"** she already was. Happiness isn't a new skill to learn, but a natural state to remember and reclaim.

2.  **Psychological Archaeology / Digging for Treasure:**
    *   **Problem Frame:** Traditional therapy is compared to "psychological archaeology" that digs up the past but often only finds "things that belong in a museum"—traumas and villains. It can leave one "mired in the negative."
    *   **Solution Frame:** The *right kind* of looking back is to **"strike gold"**—to excavate and reclaim the buried **"delight of a child."** The focus shifts from analyzing pain to recovering innate joy.

3.  **Robbery and Ransom:**
    *   B feels she must "achieve" to "deserve" happiness.
    *   A metaphorically reframes this: **She didn't "lose" her joy; she was "robbed" of it** by societal and internalized messages. Furthermore, she's been told she must **"pay a ransom"** (through achievement) to get it back. The solution is to **"reclaim stolen property"**—to simply take back the joy that is rightfully hers, no payment needed.

4.  **"It's My Party":**
    *   This is the central, anchoring metaphor. A uses the song ("It's My Party") to shift B's sense of agency.
    *   **Metaphorical Meaning:** Your mind, your emotions, your experience—**it's YOUR party.** You are the host, not a victim. You can choose what happens there: you can "cry if you want to," or you can choose to feel good. It's about reclaiming control and authority over your inner state.

5.  **Purging vs. Wallowing / Draining the Swamp:**
    *   B talks about crying to "purge" old emotions.
    *   A distinguishes between healthy release and unhealthy fixation. **"Purging means to drain the swamp, not drown in it."** Crying while reinforcing a "poor me" narrative is **"wallowing"** or having a "pity party." The key is to change the *relationship* to the emotion—to feel it with awareness and even enjoyment, not to be consumed by it.

6.  **Mojo / Inner Power:**
    *   A introduces the Pali word "mojo" (meaning inherent power or efficacy) to describe the energy and attitude needed. The goal is to **"get your mojo going"**—to shift from a passive "victim mentality" to an active "champion" mindset ready to engage with negative thoughts.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of the Psychopath in Therapy:**
    *   A tells a joke-like story about a psychopath who, in therapy, traces his issues to a spanking at age four. The therapist agrees it was the cause.
    *   **Point:** The "archaeology" stopped too soon. They never considered **he was spanked *because* he was being an "asshole."** The story critiques superficial therapy that finds a trauma to blame without seeking deeper understanding or actual repair.

2.  **The Story of Fritz Perls and Anger "Purging":**
    *   A recounts the 1970s therapeutic trend (from Gestalt therapy) where people were encouraged to beat pillows to purge anger.
    *   **Point:** This method of "purging" by escalating the emotion failed. People would go home and beat their wives. It illustrates the danger of the wrong approach to emotion—**"purging" anger by being more angry just deepens the habit.**

3.  **The Puppy "Panda" (Live Example):**
    *   The speaker's puppy, Panda, bursts into the conversation, biting and full of life.
    *   **Point:** Panda serves as a **real-time example of natural, uninhibited joy and playfulness**—the very "puppy" state A is urging B to reconnect with. A also uses Panda to explain developmental stages, linking her "oral stage" to human childhood, normalizing these natural phases of being.

4.  **Personal Memory of Childhood Dance:**
    *   B's own memory of tap-dancing to "It's My Party" at age 5 or 6 becomes a foundational story.
    *   **Point:** This is the **"gold" excavated.** It's concrete proof that she *has* experienced empowered joy. It becomes the anchor for her new "mantra" and the living disproof of her belief that she never had or can't access that feeling.

### **Musical Mantras (Metaphorical Anchors)**
A prescribes three songs as "mantras" or "anchors" to change mental state:
1.  **"It's My Party (I'll Cry If I Want To)"** – For reclaiming control.
2.  **James Brown's "I Feel Good"** – For directly cultivating the feeling of joy.
3.  **"Joy to the World" (Jeremiah Was a Bullfrog)** – For spreading that joy outward.

**Overall Narrative Arc:** The metaphors and stories work together to guide B from a story of being a **trapped, old victim** who must achieve to pay a ransom for lost joy, to the story of being a **powerful host** who can reclaim the natural, playful delight of her inner child, which was always her rightful property. The shift is from **archaeologist of pain** to **treasure hunter of joy.**
