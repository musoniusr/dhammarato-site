### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, hello everyone. Welcome to the UK Sangha. It's 12 PM Pacific Standard Time on Wednesday. I'm here with my good friend and longtime practitioner DJ. So it's really nice to see him. It's great that we can talk about Dharma together. So there wasn't any initial points of conversation that came up. So in that case, I have a sutta ready to read. It's from the Anguttara Nikaya, which Dhammarato says is not as canon as the middle-length discourses, but I just pick it out because it's a lot shorter, so it's easier to read and talk about. But there is like some recurring themes that's present in other suttas and seems to be talking about the same Dhamma. So I'll just get right into it. The title of this passage is Gratification, Danger, and Escape. So this is a recurring theme in the teachings of the Buddha, is understanding What's the appeal of something? Like, what's the pleasure of something? Like, of a sensual pleasure, whatnot, of anything that's experienced through your sense media. So like anything that you see, hear, touch, feel, etc. The pleasure in it, the danger, and the escape from it. So before my enlightenment, oh monks, when I was still a Bodhisattva, this thought occurred to me. What is the gratification in the world? What is the danger in the world? And what is the escape from the world? Then I thought, whatever joy and happiness there is in the world, That is the gratification in the world. That the world is impermanent, pervaded by suffering, and subject to change. That is the danger in the world. The removal and abandoning of desire and lust for the world. That is the escape from the world. All right, so whatever happiness you get out of the world, that is the gratification, right? But it's not saying that there's no gratification in the world and everything is just miserable. That's not what it means. A lot of people think Theravada Buddhism is saying just, oh yeah, life sucks no matter what, and there's no happiness in like worldly things. But there is a happiness. The problem is that that happiness is— there's a danger in that happiness, because that happiness is dependent, right? It's dependent upon external factors. And those external factors are by nature subject to change. So as a law of cause and effect, right, the happiness that is dependent on something that is subject to change is also subject to change. So what do we really want? Do we want a happiness that is subject to change, or something that is liberated from the cycle of changing altogether, or being dependent upon something that changes, right? So you see the futility of happiness and things that change, because that happiness is also subject to change. So the natural cycle of things throughout your life is to go through highs and lows. Some good things happen in your life, you're going to feel really happy, right? And then some shit hits the fan and then you're miserable again, right? So the idea is to realize that the cycles are inevitable. There's no avoiding it, that the high is going to come and the low is going to come. So the woke thing to do is realize that you're in a cycle and try to escape it. As soon as you realize that you're in a cycle, you're no longer infatuated by it, you know, hypnotized by it. By the cycle, you know. Uh, praise and blame too. Like somebody, somebody gives you a compliment or praises you, wow, you feel great. Somebody insults you, you feel bad. But that's just what happens, is that sometimes people are going to praise you and sometimes people are going to blame you. It's just another inevitable cycle. It's not personal, right? So to wrap your sense of self up in these kinds of things and to base your emotional state in these things is inherently foolish, because then you'll just be on a merry-go-round of highs and lows. And you'll just be like a dog chasing its tail. It's just never-ending cycle, right? Happiness that's based off of the satisfaction of previous desire is an unending quest. It's an unending search that will never come to a resolution. Right? But happiness that's not dependent upon anything, any satisfaction of desire, but happiness that's based upon the removal of desire has a conclusion to it. And the conclusion would be enlightenment as taught by the Buddha, or Nibbana. So there's a final destination whereas the search for the quench, the search for the fulfillment of desire is never-ending. This is always going to be replaced by new desires. So the idea is to wake up to the cycle that's going on and escape the cycle entirely and live your life free from mental agitation. Based upon these ever-changing circumstances. So long, monks, as I did not fully understand as they really are the world's gratification as gratification, its danger as danger, and the escape from the world as escape. For so long I did not claim that I had awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Mara, and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans. But when I had fully understood all this, then I claimed that I had awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world, its devas and humans, etc. The knowledge and vision arose in me. Unshakable is the liberation of my mind. This is my last birth. There is no more coming into any state of being. There is now no further re-becoming. Is what it says. So, um, this is just another way— gratification, danger, and escape is just another way to phrase, uh, also the Four Noble Truths. Um, so what is the danger? It's the Dukkha. What is the escape? It's the Dukkha, Nirodha, right? So, and until you see fully, experientially, what is the whole mechanism by which something is appealing, something causes suffering, and the release from that suffering, by means of not grasping for it, becoming disenchanted with it, then you can experience a supramundane level of happiness that's above it all. So it's above the world. It's not concerned with worldly things. But most people live in ignorance of all this thing that's going on inside. So they find a new shiny object, they want it, they get it, they're happy, they lose it, they're sad. All this happens without them understanding that it's all mentally fabricated. It's all a byproduct of your mental activity. So things are only valuable because you place mentally value on them, right? Why does a Mercedes-Benz make you happy? It's because the mental idea you have about a Mercedes-Benz, the status that you mentally construct about it, it's just a dead object. It doesn't have any inherent value besides the mentally created value that we give it. A diamond ring, right? Ooh, shiny rock. It's just a— it's a useless rock. It doesn't do anything. At least the car can drive you around, right? As a function. But maybe you'd be better off with a Toyota, right? It's probably less expensive to maintain. The parts are more easily replaceable. But why is a Mercedes-Benz better? It breaks down faster. It's more expensive to maintain. It's all mentally fabricated, right? So to see all of these delusions that you've inherited that's preventing you from being satisfied right now is the way that you can escape these delusions. But first, you have to wake up to the fact that you're deluding yourself into unhappiness. Can be a hard pill to swallow. Oh, I'm not happy because I don't have a girlfriend, or oh, I'm not happy because of this. And when you have a girlfriend, you're not happy because, oh, it's so stressful to maintain and all this conflict, right? It's just all mentally created. Whatever situation you're in, is not why you're unhappy. You're unhappy because of the activity of your mind through which you interpret that situation. So this is a fundamental teaching discussion about practice to come back to again and again, right? To escape the victim mentality. Um, that you can actually escape your own suffering by means of your own, um, your own practice or your own awareness of waking up to, to this, to the very thing that is causing your suffering. Because like, if you don't think that you're causing your own suffering, or if you don't realize it, that you're causing your own suffering, how can you hope to even escape it? Right? You're just eternally a victim. So to become enlightened, first you have to realize the gratification, the danger, and the escape that's all going on within the activity of your own mind, because then you can escape it, you can do something about it, right? That's the whole idea. Okay, I went in search of the gratification in the world, O monks. Whatever gratification there is in the world, that I have found. And in how far there is gratification in the world, that I have clearly seen by wisdom. I went in search of the danger of the world. Whatever danger there is in the world, that I have found. And in how far there is danger in the world, that I have clearly seen by wisdom. I went in search of an escape from the world. That escape from the world I have found. And in how far there is an escape from the world, that I have clearly seen by wisdom. Yeah, so that again is saying that you need to do it for yourself, right? You need to see it for yourself. You're not— there's no enlightenment until you see it for yourself, not somebody else told you that's the way. But if you hear it and you you subscribe to it as your new dogma, it's not going to help you, right? But if you take the teaching, look for it, investigate your own experience for yourself, and see these patterns that are happening in real time, then you can escape it also in real time, or you can grow in wisdom and understanding about it. Wisdom is the ultimate city. Wisdom is the ultimate superpower, because wisdom transcends any power, because you only need powers to get something out of the world. But with wisdom, you don't need to get anything anything out of the world anymore. You don't— you're totally free from.

**Speaker B:** Uh.

**Speaker A:** Free from the world. So you're— you don't even need a power, uh, that would be, uh, related to getting something in the world, right? So that's why wisdom is the ultimate city. All right, before I continue, DJ, is there anything you want to jump in, talk about?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no, it just— with the wisdom comment right there and it being the ultimate, uh, city or power, is that like it cuts right to the source. And that's very much the thing with the teachings of the Buddha And as we look at like gratification, danger, and escape, it's like more and more as we continue to wake up and practice and see these cycles and how it's really futile, how these things are not secure in terms of a refuge, that we can kind of just step out of it. We can recognize that that's not worth chasing. And yeah, the happiness or the contentment or the satisfaction is super mundane. It goes beyond any particular like phenomena, right? And so yeah, it's really, it's something where like, too, as you were talking about, Scott, it's like that direct recognition of it. It's not coming from a place because, oh, this was heard, or we're following the teachings of a particular teacher. It's like you get, you know, there's some knowledge there, but then it's actually practicing that. And because when there is that taste, when there is that understanding, it's that wisdom. And there's a galvanized kind of confidence, a really strong confidence, because it's not even like, it's just like, look, and it's there, right? It's just like, oh, we can recognize that. And yeah. So thank you for sharing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, thanks for talking. Yeah, there's a real, um, there's a real joy that comes from spotting, uh, these things and waking up to your own mind to realize that you can stop. You can make a change. You can stop making yourself miserable. If you're in a, you're in a hole, uh, you're, you're stuck in the same habits of your mind. The same patterns, right? You can stop, look at what you're doing. Oh, I'm thinking about all kinds of things that are making me miserable. And that's why I'm miserable. Not because of those things that I'm thinking about. It's because I'm thinking about those things. Right? It's a huge awakening. If you realize this, wow, I can just stop thinking about things that are making me miserable, and then blaming it on those things to reinforce it. Right? That's because then you're out, you're out. There's an escape. Right? The mind is like a cage. But the door is wide open. The door to the cell is wide open. And you can walk out at any point. Everything in our experience is subject to change, which means that whatever suffering you're experiencing is also subject to change. Along with the happiness, right? So if you're suffering, by the law of cause and effect, there's a way out of that suffering. And if you're not suffering, by the law of cause and effect, there's a way into suffering again. So the idea is to understand the cause and effect of suffering, so that we can come out of it directly without chasing it ignorantly, right? And things in the world, right? The, you know, the pleasures of the world, you know, they can be very infatuating, right? And there's nothing wrong with them. It only becomes a problem when that's where you're basing your satisfaction from. Like, oh, I can only be happy until I get this or this, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing wrong with enjoying whatever, like sensual stuff. That's not the problem. The problem is basing our our satisfaction off of it, because that satisfaction is going to be unreliable satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like placing ourselves in debt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, you're just playing— you're in debt, right? You can free— your debt can be forgiven. If you just stop, uh, you know, if you exit the matrix, so to speak, and you stop using money for stuff and you just go into the forest and, uh, build yourself a hut and then live off the fat of the land, right? I mean, metaphorically, this is what you should do with your happiness. Exit the whole capitalistic idea of happiness where you have to give this, oh, I have to work for happiness in the future. I have to be unhappy now so that I may be happy in the future. You're in a happiness debt. And this is what everyone has been taught, right? Oh, discipline, punish yourself now so that you can be happy later. Right? That happiness never comes. You'll be a rich billionaire and you'll still be miserable. You'll be— you'll be in your— you'll be having all your nice cars in the garage and you'll be like, okay, when is the happiness going to come? I got all my stuff that I worked hard for. It's not going to come from acquiring stuff in this world. Believe it or not, the acquirement of things in this world is a fool's game because all those things are going to disappear and you're going to die. So find out what you will take with you when you die. Find out what, what, what, okay, on your deathbed, what then is going to be important to you? That should be what is important to you right now, right? How would you think about things? How would you think about the world? How would you think about yourself? And your last dying breath. And live your life like that, as if each breath is your last breath. The power of this moment, or the miracle of this moment, can reveal itself to you with the right mindset, right? Yeah, you can actually come into a state of awe for creation, a state of awe for your experience, right? So what is the experience of awe? It's not the experience of wanting something to be different, right? It's almost like a state of just being wide awake. You're so awake to experience that you're in awe of it, right? It's an expanded state, so it's not a single-pointed— it's not a single point of concentration. It's a state of taking it all in, of just letting your entire experience in and being vibrantly awake of all of it, you know, in all directions. The locus of attention is not constricted to one thing.

**Speaker B:** Open, aware, awake. Yeah, just appreciating this being alive, life, just.

**Speaker A:** The Yeah, I mean, uh, there really is nothing to do and nowhere to go. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, no, no worries. Um, Yeah, I know that's the thing. And so that's kind of like a fun play too, is to see how can we rest with that? How can the mind rest with that? Because sometimes we can notice like, oh no, there has to be something to do, there has to be somewhere to go, and these rules start forming, or this restlessness. Restlessness is a hindrance that is, I think, one to really work with. Which is like, no, you have to do something. But just to rest with, you don't need to do anything. You don't have to do anything.

**Speaker A:** Right. So if someone's trying to meditate like this, there's going to be a general sense of like unease, right? When you stop doing stuff, there's going to be a sense of restlessness of, oh crap, now that I'm alone with my thoughts, or I should be doing something, right? And the idea is to intentionally release this restlessness by changing your mindset about it. Oh no, actually everything is okay right now. And actually I could just sit here and there is actually nothing to do. And to literally reassure yourself out of the restlessness. And to take a deep breath and relax, right, out of the restlessness. And if the restlessness is stubborn, then make friends with it. Don't try to force it to go away, right? That's more restlessness. Oh, it's just a couple bodily sensations. It's not a big deal. Hello, restlessness, my old friend. It's a temporary guest in the home. It also is subject to change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's fun. I like to bring this up from time to time, but like, you know, playing that little game of, you know, when it comes up, you know, you spot it, say, glad to see you, restlessness. Because in that way, you know, restlessness, boredom is no longer an issue. You know, when we have the gladdening the mind, or just, you know, Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and there's also other techniques too. Like, you can just go for a walk too. You can do walking meditation. I found some of my greatest meditative moments was while I was walking, right? So walking does not mean that you're not meditating if you're walking. You're aware of every single bodily sensation as you walk, every single step, right? Every single mental formation. But you know, there's kind of that restlessness, it kind of has an outlet by the activity, the motion of the walk. So you don't have to sit there. Like if you're ever sitting, you don't have to sit and punish yourself and until your suffering gets worse and worse and worse, right? Thinking that you're making progress. No, like, you should have like a more intuitive understanding of meditation, right? Unless you're on a retreat or something and you're doing something that's specifically structured. I mean, if you're doing a specifically structured meditation practice, that's different. But I'm talking about um, uh, daily living meditation of daily life. Like, every moment you can always— if.

**Speaker B:** You'Re waiting— oh, sorry, yeah, go ahead. I just wanted to add, yeah, if you're like waiting in line at the bank and, you know, the thought comes up like, oh, this is so bored, I wait, I'm so bored, you know, I wish I was somewhere else, and all that, you know, it's like spotting that and being able to come back to that peace, to that ease, to that calm of, wait, no, there's no place to go, there's nothing to do. Glad to see your restlessness in that kind of situation, right? It's like, oh cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Or if you're at work, right? And you're like, oh, I can be happy once I get off work. And then you get off work and you're at home and you're like, oh, I'm bored. There's nothing to do. Right? You have to like really, this is the cycle. Like be happy at work, you know, now's the moment. Yay, I'm at work. Yippee. Let me enjoy this being at work, you know, not thinking, oh shit, when is this gonna be over? Because that same mindset will continue into not when you're not at work, right? You're going to be like, oh, I'm bored, I need something to do. Um, uh, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the development of that like skill of, of being able to, to spot that and to change, you know, in a wholesome way, yeah, that carries over like you're saying, Scott, like when you get back home, it actually makes it easier to, while we're at home, or we are practicing in seclusion, to enjoy ourselves, or to be able to just come back to that, you know, rest. If we remember to do that, like in a situation like we're at work, or we're in a line, or, you know, wherever, right? So it's like, it's still, I think that's like like, if we have the mindset of I have to be in seclusion in order to do this, you know, and then start craving for that seclusion when we're not in that really a situation where maybe it's the most advantageous thing to do so, right? Like, if we're like, okay, we're at work and we're like, you know, if you go and be like, okay, it's time to get into seclusion, right? I really want to get into seclusion. And you just walk out, you know, of your job. You know, maybe that's the thing to do if you're like, okay, I'm going to go off and ordain or something. This is the shift, right? But like, it's one of those things where it's like, no, let's see what we can do here. Right? And then, okay, when it's time for seclusion, we can enjoy that. When we're in the world, we can enjoy that. Right? So it's like, whatever we're kind of with, you know, we can come back and appreciate that with that. Hey, I like the situation that's going on here, but I don't want it. I don't need to form this, you know, rule that it has to always be like this. Yeah, because it's always— the circumstances are changing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so I found another passage. Um, I haven't read it before, but it seems kind of interesting. Uh, it's called The Stream, so I'm gonna read it right now. These, uh, these four kinds of persons, oh monks, are to be found in the world. What for? The person who goes with the stream, the one who goes against the stream, the one who stands firm, and the one who has crossed over and gone to the far shore, a Brahman who stands on dry land. Of what nature is a person who goes with the stream? It is one who indulges his sensual desire and commits wrong deeds. Of what nature is one who goes against the stream? It is one who does not indulge sensual desire and commit wrong deeds. He lives the holy life, though in painful struggle, with difficulty, sighing, and in tears. Of what nature is one who stands firm? It is one who, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, is due to be reborn spontaneously and there attain final Nibbana. So Anagami, it seems like it's talking about. Of what nature is one who has crossed over and gone to the far shore? A Brahman who stands on dry land. It is one who, with the destruction of the taints in this very life, enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberated by wisdom, having realized it for himself by direct knowledge. These monks are the four kinds of persons to be found in the world. Yeah, so I think this is good.

**Speaker C:** Because.

**Speaker A:** Explanation that the idea is not to like— oh, hey Brett, welcome!

**Speaker B:** Hey, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, are you guys good to have you? The idea is not to just miserably, um, practice not indulging in things and just repress yourself, because it talks about how miserable that person is, you know, in the name of being holy, to not do these things. That idea is you want to escape it. That you want to escape the cycle of it by wisdom. So idea is not to live a certain— the idea is not to punish ourselves and do something that we really rather be doing, right? And just live in suffering of that, but to find out through your own wisdom why that's not going to satisfy you, to like become disenchanted with it, like so that you don't even want it anymore. The idea is not to do some, to repress yourself, right? I'm not going to do this because it's the holy thing to do, but you really wish you were doing it, right? It's probably better just to go do it in that case, because then at least you won't be miserable.

**Speaker C:** Spiritual chains.

**Speaker A:** Spiritual what?

**Speaker C:** Chains.

**Speaker A:** Chains, yeah. So, and nobody likes that type of person anyways. They're always looking down on others, judging people, right? Oh, I'm holier than thou. But inside they're miserable, right? The angry priest. Nobody likes these people anyways. I'd rather hang out with the hedonist, right? But the idea is that to escape it is to not suffer from it whatsoever. And that can be practiced by very enjoyable means. So Jhana is very enjoyable. The reason why Jhana gives us like a stepping stone to let go of these more unrefined states of happiness that are fleeting and like dependent upon sensual pleasure. So like the pleasure you get from eating or the pleasure you get from fucking, it's so fleeting, right? It's just like, yeah, it's gone. So like, there's a more sustained— like, there's higher pleasures to be had, like, literally, um, through the practice of, uh, through the practice of Jhana. So like, if you're— yeah, above the world. We were talking about that a lot before you hopped on, that we're talking about being above the world, right? So these pleasures are um, you're gonna— you're so happy with just existence itself and just being alive that like you don't even want anything else, right? But there's no reason to say they're mutually exclusive. Uh, you could be so happy that you don't want anything else and also be having sex at the same time, or not having sex, right? It's not dependent on that. So the idea is to escape the cycle of happiness being dependent upon things that are so fleeting, so impermanent, because that happiness is inevitably going to turn into suffering. As soon as it's gone, you want more. Or if you have it, you're scared to lose it. Right? So that happiness is so dependent, so fragile. And that happiness is inevitably going to lead to future suffering. So if you realize the futility of it, then all of it becomes less important to you psychologically. And when it's less important to you psychologically, then you could just be happy without it, right? I don't need that. Yeah, go ahead, Brett. Are you gonna say something?

**Speaker C:** I was going to point out too, and you may have already covered this before I jumped in, often we're taught or along the way we misunderstood through ignorance to believe that going after some of these worldly pleasures of the senses such as sense pleasure and sexuality, that if we get that then we're satiated or we're sated and we won't have to have it for a while or we won't be hungry. But often when we indulge in these things, it just makes us more hungry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker C:** The satiation— I mean, the satisfaction or the temporary or worldly or the, uh.

**Speaker A:** It'S the same thing with junk food. The more junk food you eat, the more junk food you're going to want, right? So someone develops the habit of eating junk food all the time, and I'm not even hungry for it, so I don't eat junk food, so I don't really get the desire to eat it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Um, I do eat junk food sometimes. That was a lie, but, but, but the idea is the same. Uh, and it's the fasting works the same way. So I don't get hungry until at least like 2 or 3 PM every day because I don't eat until at least 5 PM every day. I'm not saying like everyone should do that, that's just what I do. But so now my body is trained to not be hungry. I don't even get hungry in the morning. Uh, at first it was really hungry and it was painful to like not do it. So I, um, that's the only— I think like renouncing something is good if it helps you stop wanting it, but it's useless if you just keep wanting it because it's just going to be—.

**Speaker C:** Can cause aversion.

**Speaker A:** It's aversion, right? You're averse to not having it. Maybe it might be better to like wean off of it. Like, so for example, like a heroin addict or like someone who's addicted to alcohol, it's a really bad idea for them to just cold turkey quit, especially for alcohol, because you could actually die from withdrawals.

**Speaker C:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** So if you try to cold turkey, you know, the things— all of your happiness is previously based off these things, and you try to cold turkey it, you're not going to have any other happiness because you don't know how to be happy without them. So it's going to be devastatingly miserable. A lot of people have like terrible experiences if they go on a like a, like a meditation retreat, like a hard one, and they're just totally cold turkey life, then they don't know what to do, right? They can have even a psychotic break.

**Speaker C:** They can decomp.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I think that there's a— you should have a more easygoing way, method of meditation, right? Instead of slamming the brakes brakes and trying to come to a screeching halt. Just tap the brakes, you know, just bite-sized chunks, right? Oh, all I can handle right now is 5 minutes of meditation, then do 5 minutes. Don't, you know, don't sit in misery for an hour if 5 minutes would be better.

**Speaker C:** Multiple micro hits of meditation throughout the day is wonderful.

**Speaker A:** It can be like microdosing meditation, you know, like people like to microdose. Yeah, just a microdose. Uh, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Nothing wrong with it, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if there's— if there's anywhere else you guys would like to go with this, I'm open to it.

**Speaker C:** I had a question regarding the previous topic of food. And fasting. Okay, what— okay, Scott, what would be your advice? Or DJ, if you have any ideas, um, if someone has the form— because I'm this way, and I just got off the phone a while ago with a friend, um, from another state who has the same problem, and I think it's genetic, or it could be also neurological part of that profile, but we forget to eat. And it's not even— it's not volitional fasting, you know, like we tried to. It's just— there can be multiple causes, but it seems to just happen so often that it'll come to be 1, 2, 3 o'clock and we haven't even eaten breakfast. And, you know, I've actually lately instituted lists and actually a script so that I will eat because I have to have my head clear. I wake up at 5:30 or 6 in the morning, fix my wife's breakfast, fix her lunch, pack all that stuff, and then force myself to take a bite. Otherwise I'll just skip breakfast and start going with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, so like these types of questions, it's really person to person. It just depends. So it's like I can't give you like a fair answer. For me personally, not eating until like, uh, 4 or 5 PM every day, I feel great. I have more energy. If you feel terrible, then it's probably better for you to eat differently, you know? So I just do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Like, I think it should be like more, uh, intuitive.

**Speaker B:** Um, you're right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just do it based on what feels best for your body, you know. What do you feel? But do you feel like crap from this certain way? Yeah, then don't do that, you know. I can't really say, like, some people have different metabolisms and stuff like that, so maybe fasting isn't as good for them. But for me personally, I found it very beneficial. Uh, yeah.

**Speaker C:** I have found fasting to be beneficial in times of more meditation, in times of retreat, in those scenarios. And then in that case, I also.

**Speaker A:** Think the thing that makes it different for me is the sheer volume that I eat when I'm not fasting. So like, I used to play like D1 water polo So the amount of calories I would have to eat every day is probably double what you would eat in a normal day, or maybe even triple. So when I stopped playing water polo, I still ate like this, right? And that is way too many calories. So for me, I fast because when I eat, I still eat like that. Like I put that much volume and then it's like the perfect amount for the rest of the day. But If someone eats like less per sitting that they eat, it's probably better to spread it out because then, because then you wouldn't be— the problem is you wouldn't be getting in enough calories when you do eat because you can't like physically stomach all that food. But my stomach is huge, like because of how I eat, it's already huge and I can eat a lot in like one go. Yeah. So that's another thing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. I don't think that I wasn't in a— I think I didn't language my question in a way that it was. In the maximum level of skill. I think what I was after was the teaching, and I think it eventually came out, and I think that's the Buddhist methods. And if we're using meditation correctly, we go further in body and we know our bodies.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's how the monks— the monks essentially do it the opposite. So they do— essentially, if you eat like a monk, you would be doing intermittent fasting. You only eat one meal in the morning. But then again, the monk doesn't really do much all day, kind of just sits around all day.

**Speaker C:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** So if you're more active, you're probably going to need more food because you're doing more things.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I've heard. Yeah, I've heard that. And I've heard if there's a lot of construction on the monastery, then the food regimen is sometimes adjusted to facilitate construction. Having more energy for it.

**Speaker A:** If they're actually doing physical labor, yeah, they're going to need more food. Yeah, interesting stuff. Yeah, I mean, we could talk about whatever, like, whatever is interesting.

**Speaker B:** I'm cool chilling for a bit.

**Speaker A:** Let's see, I probably have time to read one, at least one more passage, if you guys would like to hear another one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay, so I haven't read this, but it's titled The Best Kinds of Faith, which kind of sparked my interest, so I'm going to read it. Monks, there are four best kinds of faith. What for? Monks, Among all living beings, be they footless or two-footed, with four feet or many feet, with form or formless, percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, the Tathagata, the Arahant, the fully enlightened one, is reckoned the best of them all. Those who have faith in the Buddha have faith in the best, and for those who have faith in the best, the best result will be theirs. All right, so this is kind of interesting. It's talking about like the different configurations in which you could have a body, right? Could have two feet, you could have four feet, you could be an animal, you could be a human, you You could have all different kinds of body, but what is the best way to be is to not have a body at all. So like, that's what the Arahant is. The Arahant has transcended like having a body, right? In fact, the experience that there is no body in the actual experience of Nibbana, because all mental perceptions have come to an end or ceased temporarily at least. So in that moment, there's no body. If there's no body, there's no suffering. Because if you think about it, have you ever suffered anywhere other than the body? If you think about something and you experience a negative emotion, it's always somewhere in the body, right? Where else would the suffering be? Like, where else could you possibly experience suffering?

**Speaker C:** That's where the world is experienced as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly, the world. So like, even a thought— so we don't suffer because of a thought, we suffer because of how that thought makes you feel, right? And feeling always arises as some sort of tension in the body. So if you escape the body, or you realize that this body is not me, This is not my body. I don't actually have a body. Then you can be free of— that's the, that's the most, that's the highest form. Like, that's the most enlightened. And it's saying that you should put your faith in that form. So not like the form of a Buddha, like meditating. No, like the actually the first ways that the Buddha was depicted was by not depicting the Buddha. It was like sacrilegious. They would just depict the tree where the Buddha would be sitting and the things around it, but they didn't actually put the Buddha because the idea is that the Buddha isn't in the body, right? The, the, in the, the Arhat, the awakened mind, is not a body, you know. It's totally expanded, totally formless. There's nothing, uh, phenomenally constructed that can be like pointed to as the Buddha. So that's what you should have faith in. That should be where your faith is.

**Speaker C:** The Arahant is no longer bound by the aggregates.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Um, even though they would live the rest of their lives with a body disjoint, you've seen that There's no more like identity in the body. Even for stream entry, you don't see the body as self.

**Speaker C:** Not me, not mind, right?

**Speaker A:** Monks, among all things conditioned, the Noble Eightfold Path is reckoned to be the best of them all. So the Noble Eightfold Path and the whole teaching of the Dharma is still conditioned, right? But it's the best thing that is conditioned because it's the way out of it. Those who have faith in the Noble Eightfold Path have faith in the best. And for those who have faith in the best, the best results will be theirs. Monks, among all things conditioned and unconditioned, dispassion is reckoned to be the best of them all. The crushing of all infatuation, the removal of thirst, the uprooting of attachment, the cutting off of the round of rebirth, the destruction of craving, Vipassana, Nibbana. Those who have faith in the Dhamma of dispassion have faith in the best, and for those who have faith in the best, the best results will be theirs. Monks, among all religious orders or communities, the The Sangha of the Tathagata's disciples is reckoned to be the best. That is to say, the four pairs of noble persons, the eight noble individuals, the Sangha of the Blessed Ones is worthy of gifts, worthy of gifts and hospitality. All right. So it's saying like the Dhamma is the best. All right. We are, we're number one. And this practice is the best way out of suffering. It's the best way out of suffering because it's the most direct. Other traditions care about all kinds of things like what's God or what's this and that. It doesn't— it might be distracted from what's the point of religion to begin with, is to bring an end to your own suffering. There's no other point to religion, right? And people get distracted and they wage holy wars and they think things matter that don't, when the Buddha just taught just the way out of suffering, nothing else. There's no weird religious dogma like, oh, God sent me here to tell you this. I mean, there's some of that stuff in Buddhism too, like after the Buddha attained enlightenment, God had to convince him, or a deva had to convince him to teach the Dharma. Because he didn't think it would be possible for anyone to understand. So that's what it says in the story. So I mean, that's kind of similar to Jesus being the Son of God or whatever. But the idea is always the Buddha taught bringing an end to suffering explicitly and directly. Yeah. Is there any other things anyone wants to talk about.

**Speaker C:** It seems as though that story, it seems as though when he did awaken beneath the Bodhi tree in that story, did he not hang out for a while by himself in the woods for a while in the story with his mind blown, just thinking, you know, this is wonderful, but no one's going to be able to learn this, no one's going to, it's too subtle, it's too hard to see, it's too profound. How am I going to teach this?

**Speaker A:** And there's a select few amount of people that can actually learn it, but otherwise that's still true. Most people will never even put their pinky toe in the Dhamma because they just can't. Like, you have to be intelligent enough, and I don't even mean intelligence in as conventional intelligence, but spiritual intelligence, right? Enough to grasp these things. You can be stupid and understand the Dhamma because the Dhamma can be simplified too. It's like rudimentary, it's a rudimentary like essence. So the, the, the, the Dhamma can be, you know, taught, expressed in its essence and in its particulars. And in the technical things. It's all-encompassing, right? So if you get its essence, then you get all the particulars. And if you get the particulars, you get its essence. So no matter how good of a critical thinker you are, doesn't really matter. But your ability to grasp the Dhamma does matter. And most people don't even have that ability or desire to do that. So most people are excluded from the teaching of the Dharma just right off the bat because of that.

**Speaker C:** I can't see it. I wanted to ask you if you— it is said that in Sariputta's quest to attain Arahantship, it took him longer.

**Speaker A:** Now it only took Sariputta 2 weeks.

**Speaker C:** Right, that was a bit longer.

**Speaker A:** No, it took the Buddha a long time. The Buddha had to do all kinds of things. The Buddha went, tried asceticism, he tried this and that. He was at it for a while, but once he learned it, he taught it to Sariputta, who essentially attained Arhatship in 2 weeks.

**Speaker C:** I think Ananda was said to have attained it. There were 5, weren't there?

**Speaker A:** Ananda took a long time. Anagami. It took a little bit because of the attachment to the Buddha. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** It took Anicca much longer. Yeah, because he had to wait for the Buddha to be deceased and because his clinging to the Buddha was so strong. That's the way I understood it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker C:** And so when the Buddha passed away, then he was no longer his attendant. And I believe according to Bhikkhu Bhajrasa, he was also his cousin. And so there was attachment, familial attachment, as well as he was his best friend and he was an attendant. And then after that, he was able to attain Arhatship himself. But I have heard that it took Sariputta longer because of his skill in analytical thinking and intelligence.

**Speaker A:** And so— No, it was really fast for Sariputta. It only took him 2 weeks because that was his strong suit. So I'm saying like your critical thinking and skill can be used as an advantage in the practice of the Dharma, but it's not a requirement. So like there's, that's the cool thing about the Dharma is it can be taught very technically or it can just be taught like by its essence, you know, by maybe not as like exact of languaging, you know. Just, um, Dhammarato makes it really simple all the time, right? That's his, like, trademark, is to make it as colloquial and simple as possible. So it doesn't have to be very technical, right? You don't have to talk about the aggregates and the dependent origination of the volitional formations and stuff like that. You don't have to get into all that. Um, you can, but you don't have to.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, if it helps. And depends on the form.

**Speaker A:** It's person to person. Exactly. Every— everything is case by case.

**Speaker C:** In my case, it's enjoyable and it's joyful and it's faith-building to read certain things, but not to overdo it. And certainly I'm obsessed.

**Speaker A:** Certainly. I think the best thing to become obsessed with is the Dhamma. I think you should become obsessed with it. That's the best, because that's what the thing I just read is trying to say. Like, out of everything to become obsessed with, that's what you should become obsessed with. Because if you're not obsessed with the Dharma, you're just going to be obsessed with something else. That's just the nature of the mind, is to obsess about something. So use the Dhamma to obsess about it, and then you can center the mind on something wholesome. And when the mind is centered on something wholesome, then the experience of the path, you know, can come into fruition. But if the mind is always jumping other places, the fruits won't be as apparent as if the mind is totally centered upon the Dhamma. There's nothing else that you're thinking about besides Dharma. Everything is Dharma.

**Speaker C:** It's concentration. That's the 8th path factor.

**Speaker A:** All right, I think I'll end it there, guys. Thanks for coming. I really appreciate seeing you guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And yeah, any last words, DJ?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when we talk about, you know, the Dharma being the best, it really is. Yeah, like you were saying, Scott, like the most direct and also just the most thorough. So that's something that, you know, when you read the sutras, there's like— it's.

**Speaker A:** The most thorough, like nothing really compares to how thorough it actually is. Yeah. Any last words, Brett?

**Speaker C:** The Dhamma is that one fortunate attachment.

**Speaker A:** One fortunate attachment, right? That's right, right. That Citta says it better, says it the best. Yeah. All right, thank you guys. I'll see you next time. Bye-bye.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Scott.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, David.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Scott)** with contributions from **Speaker B (DJ)** and **Speaker C (Brett)**, revolves around core Buddhist themes of **gratification, danger, and escape**, framed by readings from the Anguttara Nikaya. Here is a summary of the key points:

---

### **1. Central Teaching: Gratification, Danger, and Escape**
- The Buddha’s reflection before enlightenment focused on:
  - **Gratification (assāda):** The joy or happiness found in worldly experiences (sensual pleasures, praise, possessions).
  - **Danger (ādīnava):** The inherent suffering in these experiences because they are **impermanent, dependent on conditions, and subject to change**.
  - **Escape (nissaraṇa):** The removal of desire and lust for the world, leading to liberation.
- This framework mirrors the **Four Noble Truths** (suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path).

---

### **2. The Futility of Worldly Happiness**
- Worldly happiness is **dependent, fragile, and cyclical**—it leads to highs and lows (e.g., praise/blame, gain/loss).
- Seeking satisfaction in external things (like a Mercedes-Benz or a relationship) is a “fool’s game” because these are **mentally constructed values** and will inevitably change.
- True happiness comes from **wisdom and disenchantment** with this cycle, not from repression or forced renunciation.

---

### **3. Wisdom as the Ultimate Freedom**
- **Wisdom (paññā)** is emphasized as the “ultimate city” or “superpower”—it allows one to see the nature of reality and **escape mental agitation**.
- Freedom comes from **direct personal insight**, not from dogma or blind faith. One must observe their own mind to understand how suffering is created.
- The goal is a **supramundane happiness** that is not dependent on conditions—Nibbana.

---

### **4. Practical Meditation and Daily Life**
- Meditation should be **intuitive and gentle**, not a form of self-punishment:
  - Start with small, manageable sessions (“microdosing meditation”).
  - Use techniques like **walking meditation** or **mindfulness in daily activities** (e.g., waiting in line, working).
  - Meet restlessness or boredom with **friendly awareness** (“Hello, restlessness”) rather than resistance.
- The aim is to **find ease and contentment in the present moment**, regardless of circumstances.

---

### **5. The Four Kinds of Persons (Sutta: “The Stream”)**
- The sutta describes four types:
  1. **Going with the stream:** Indulging in sensual desires.
  2. **Going against the stream:** Struggling miserably to resist desires (not recommended).
  3. **Standing firm:** An Anāgāmi (non-returner) who has destroyed lower fetters.
  4. **Crossed over:** An Arahant, fully liberated.
- The path is about **wise escape, not repression**. It’s better to indulge with understanding than to resist with aversion.

---

### **6. Faith in the Dhamma**
- The best objects of faith are:
  - The Buddha (as the awakened one, beyond form).
  - The Dhamma (the teachings, especially the Noble Eightfold Path).
  - The Sangha (the community of noble disciples).
- Buddhism is presented as the **most direct and thorough path to end suffering**, free from dogma or divine command.

---

### **7. Personal Anecdotes and Advice**
- The group discusses **fasting, diet, and lifestyle**—emphasizing intuitive, body-aware choices rather than rigid rules.
- **Obsession with the Dhamma** is encouraged as a wholesome focus, replacing unwholesome attachments.
- The tone is **colloquial and accessible**, reflecting Dhammarato’s style of simplifying teachings.

---

### **Overall Message**
The talk encourages **waking up to the cycles of craving and suffering** in one’s own mind, using wisdom to see “gratification, danger, and escape” in real time. The path is about **gentle, insightful practice** leading to a happiness that is unconditional and free from the world’s instability.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Cycle / Merry-Go-Round / Dog Chasing Its Tail:** Used to describe the inevitable and endless ups and downs of worldly happiness and suffering, where one is perpetually infatuated and trapped.
2.  **The Mind as a Cage with an Open Door:** Represents the idea that suffering is a mental prison, but the escape (through awareness and dispassion) is always available if one chooses to see it and walk out.
3.  **Happiness Debt / Capitalistic Happiness:** Describes the mindset of sacrificing present contentment for a future reward, which is portrayed as a futile economic transaction that never yields true satisfaction.
4.  **The Matrix:** Used to symbolize the conventional, deluded world of seeking satisfaction from external things; "exiting the matrix" means waking up to this delusion.
5.  **Wisdom as the Ultimate City / Superpower:** Portrays wisdom (paññā) as the supreme refuge and ability, as it frees one from the need to acquire anything from the world.
6.  **Restlessness as a Temporary Guest / Old Friend:** A personification to encourage a friendly, non-combative relationship with hindrances during meditation, acknowledging their impermanent nature.
7.  **Microdosing Meditation:** Likens short, frequent meditation sessions to the contemporary practice of microdosing psychedelics, suggesting small, manageable "doses" of practice can be integrated throughout the day.
8.  **The Stream (from the sutta):** A central metaphor for four types of people:
    *   **Going with the stream:** Indulging in sensual desires.
    *   **Going against the stream:** Struggling with renunciation but filled with conflict.
    *   **Standing firm:** Partially liberated (Anāgāmi).
    *   **Crossed over to the far shore / standing on dry land:** Fully liberated (Arahant).
9.  **Junk Food vs. Nutritious Food:** Compares addictive, fleeting sensual pleasures to junk food that increases craving, contrasting it with the sustained nourishment of deeper meditative happiness (jhāna).
10. **The Body as the Locus of Suffering:** All suffering (including from thoughts) is felt as sensation in the body; transcending identification with the body is key to freedom.
11. **The Dharma as the "One Fortunate Attachment":** A paradoxical metaphor suggesting that if the mind must be attached to something, the path to liberation is the only wholesome and fruitful object.

### **Stories & References**
1.  **The Buddha's Hesitation to Teach:** Referenced when Speaker A mentions that after his enlightenment, a deva (Brahmā Sahampati) had to convince the Buddha to teach, as he doubted anyone would understand the profound Dhamma.
2.  **The Depiction of the Buddha in Early Art:** The story that early Buddhist art did not depict the Buddha in human form (using symbols like an empty seat or a tree) is used to illustrate that the awakened state is formless and not the physical body.
3.  **The Attainment Stories of Disciples:**
    *   **Sāriputta:** Mentioned as attaining arahantship very quickly (in two weeks) after hearing the Dhamma, demonstrating how acute understanding can accelerate the path.
    *   **Ānanda:** Referenced as taking much longer to attain arahantship due to his deep personal attachment to the Buddha as his cousin, attendant, and friend, only achieving full liberation after the Buddha's passing.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make abstract Buddhist concepts like impermanence, suffering, non-self, and liberation more relatable and vivid, while the historical references root the discussion in the tradition's narrative.
