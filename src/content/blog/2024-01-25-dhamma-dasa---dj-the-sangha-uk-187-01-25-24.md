### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Let me know if it says that it's recording at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do see Dhamma is recording the call. Okay, looking good.

**Speaker A:** So sweet. So you said you're reading the, uh, the Heart Sutra?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, specifically the Thich Nhat Hanh translation, but I've been for like the past month about every day or every other day once I kind of got it down, I've been like reciting it from memory. So just like straight from the memory. I mean, it's not an incredibly long sutra. It takes like anywhere from like 3 to 5 minutes depending on how fast you're kind of going over it. But yeah, it's kind of nice. Like that sort of, you know, having the sutra helps to gladden the mind, right? Right? So it's directing it towards wholesome things. And then it does help with collecting it and sort of focus, because you can notice like when the mind kind of wanders away from, you know, the sutra or the memory of being able to recall it, right? So, and it also I find helps with like, you know, just kind of going over it in one's mind, but also that kind of directly sort of looking at it, there builds a familiarity with it as that invitation to sort of like look. And especially too, what's interesting with the Heart Sutra is it really goes over like the Five Aggregates or the Five Skandhas. So it's kind of cool because in and of itself it's sort of like a guided, you know, meditation, if you will, or practice?

**Speaker A:** Oh, nice. Yeah, I always, um, just for myself, I find it easy to, to change my Dukkha as it arises. To me, that's not very difficult. I feel like something that kind of goes subtly under the radar is remembering the remembering part, to the remembering to do it. Because even when you say like, wake up, you have to remember to wake up. And it's like society's kind of like— everything in your day-to-day life is kind of like Mara, kind of like lulling you in to follow me, you know. And then you remember to look and say, aha, I see you, Mara. But the consistency and the momentum of getting into a place where it becomes easier to recognize Mara for what she is, and getting rid of ignorance. To me, the remembering part is what I try to cultivate usually throughout my day, because the changing Once I remember, I'm like, I almost breathe the sigh of the relief before everything. I'm just like, ah, I can remember to let go, or to— like Dhammarato says, letting go, it'll still be in your hand, but you can turn it over and let go completely. To be more specific, letting go completely of these things that we're attached to that are causing us Dukkha or dissatisfaction. Because everything is really subtle in our day-to-day life. Everything is like, it's designed that way because it's designed by ignorance. It's designed by people who are chasing Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. So they don't see it for what it is. So when you're watching a commercial, They lull you in with get a gym membership, get the new car, get the new house, get the new career, go to the new university, and all under the impression that this is somehow gonna give us lasting happiness. And usually 99.9% of the time, it always ends up with just more Dukkha, being covered in Dukkha. And I'm not really aware of anything outside of Buddhism really, and some other religions and practices, whatever you want to call them, that give the option to step outside out of all of that, you know. Usually, to quote Tolstoy, he said, "There was not an evil deed that I did not commit." And the more he leaned into that, the more famous he became and the more prominent his name became. And he was observing that and he's like, "Man, I don't want this type of life." He had all the money, he had everything, and he just wasn't happy, wasn't satisfied. And that's the name of the game, is satisfaction. And I think oftentimes when people get into Buddhism, it can start with with the wholesome attachments, then sometimes it could turn into unwholesome. Like, what gets you interested sometimes for a lot of Westerners is this idea of the goal at the end of the race or the mountain that we climb. But as you become more seasoned in your practice, that wholesome intention, although a bit ignorant, it can turn into something unwholesome because there's still the Samsaras of the trophies or the rewards or the heavens in the Christian sense of, "I did all the work, now where's the goods?" Instead of realizing that the goods are already here within us. Like Jesus said, "The kingdom of heaven is within you." You know, we're swimming in enlightenment. We just can't see it because of delusion, because of ignorance. And it's not like— so you may not know this, but you always remind me, like, when I'm talking with you, it's not necessarily the magical thing that the Western culture has made it up to be. We put it on this pedestal, like this is exactly what I'm talking about, the goals and the achievements and the careers, and enlightenment is just one other thing to run after like a rat chasing cheese, you know. But really it's here now, and it's very simple. And if we remember to look in a balanced way, remember to wake up and look, in a balanced way throughout our day. And just see, just take a look, observe if there's any dissatisfaction in the moment. And catching it early when it's just a young little budding tree or plant before it becomes a giant oak tree. Catching it, taking care of it. Taking care of it meaning remembering to change it with our speech, both inner and outer speech, from unwholesome thoughts, unwholesome feelings, to wholesome thoughts and wholesome feelings. And one of the best wholesome thoughts I could think of is coming back home to the breath. Coming back home to what I like to call the doorway in the present moment, the doorway to our true nature that's always been here. Peace, our true peaceful nature of being satisfied. And as we get better at practicing this, just like exercise, just like anything else, it becomes easier You know, like Dhammarato says, or at least I think he says— sorry, Dhammarato, if this is not what you said— but it's like lifting weights. You can't turn into the Incredible Hulk after lifting 20 pounds for a couple reps, you know. It takes sometimes days, weeks, and years, but it's not really a difficult thing if you think about it. Just takes a little effort, the right effort and the right attitude. And in no time almost, you know, you look in the mirror one day, after a few months you start seeing some real changes. And it's the same thing with our mind. It's the same thing with satisfaction. After a while, Mara, who at first appeared to be this big angry monster, in the words of Jiddu Krishnamurti, one day that monster you were afraid to see around the corner, you look finally around the corner and you see it's just a little puppy. It was really nothing ever to be afraid of, you know, and you were already free. Yeah. I always liked that imagery of turning the corner and then just seeing a little puppy staring at you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it's this giant monster and nope, it's just a small puppy. Don't worry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and a good way to see a lot of these things I'm talking about is One of my favorite techniques or methods is observing others. And, well, actually it's not my technique or method, just like Dhammarato says, the Buddha created this. I actually read it the other day in one of the suttas. I couldn't tell you which one, but the Buddha was talking about how when you're observing other people, you see that they lose a family member. And yeah, you may feel sad for them a bit, but you're not nearly as devastated as they are with the loss of people in their life. Or you're not nearly as devastated when your friend loses a lover and they're heartbroken. You're not crying and pounding on the ground with your fists. And it's a wonderful, curious thing that happens when you're just observing other people in their day-to-day lives, particularly like what I'm saying, when something happens that really seems to cause them a lot of Dukkha. Because they have this cloud over their head and you're sitting here dry and you have almost no effort. But if you have the right wisdom, you look at them and you can learn from them and see like, wow, look how they're pining and perishing over something that, yes, is sad, but also it's gone beyond a natural kind of response to the event, and it's entered the realm of Samsara. And you see them, and you can observe this quietly, and you can see how unattached you are and how totally attached they are, and how your unattachment is leading to this peaceful freedom, but their attachment is causing them such a great deal of suffering. And then it dawns on you, like, wow, maybe I can do this with the things that occur to this fictitious character, to this fictitious thing that I call myself. Perhaps when these events happen, like— and it doesn't have to be as dramatic as, you know, it doesn't have to be something crazy huge, but, you know, it could be something as simple as like losing a losing your car keys or your jacket or shoes or something like that. It could be something so simple. Um, like Bukowski says, sometimes it's not the big things that drive somebody mad. It's like, it's the broken shoelace when you're running late to work, just as you're about to get in your car. The broken shoelace that finally drives you to the loony bin.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the madhouse. All that.

**Speaker A:** Suppressed rage, so to speak. But really, if we were remembering to look, we could turn everything around. We could turn all that Dukkha into Sukkha. And the masters prove it to us, like Zen Master Seung Sahn. And I've probably told you this before, But this is what it's all about, is the consistency and the remembering. But Zen Master Seung Sahn, when he had heart problems, great heart problems, he was an old man at this time, his students were like devastated, but they asked him how he feels and he said, "The doctor said my heart is making music." And he put his hand on his chest and it was just like just joyfully laughing about it, about dying, about his body failing him. He turned it into a beautiful symphony.

**Speaker B:** Wow!

**Speaker A:** If that's not a beautiful example of living the Dharma, I don't know what is, you know. And there are many, there are many examples of this from all types of Dharma practitioners turning the changing the Dukkha into Sukkha with the right effort and with the right attitude, you become the captain of your ship, so to speak.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, it's really too, right, developing that skill of remembering to do that, especially one thing kind of, we could say, in a worldly way, goes south, right? The body starts failing and all these different things. But to be able to take that and turn it around and be like, hey, you know what? At the end of the day, that's okay. This is the way that reality is, right? Yeah. And we don't have to identify with these things. Like you were saying, Dhamma, when we're looking at other people, right? And we see people are caught up in various different attachments, but, you know, they're not us. So we don't have to necessarily, you know, we don't perhaps feel it so much. But then the next level is when we look at this, you know, person, this being, and we see these different, you know, collections of, you know, body, the feeling, the perceptions that make things up, you know, our habitual sort of memory. And like consciousness, and we see this all to be non-self. We can look at that, and even with that, you know, we can look at what we would consider to be ourselves in very much that same way, and we don't have to feel that same amount of dissatisfaction. We don't have to feel that same amount of pain. It's very liberating. And that's not like completely and totally, I think, you know, disconnecting or dissociating. No, it's actually being very much here. It's being here with reality as it is and being able to, you know, accept that. But we can see the way out if we can remember it, right? That's the skill. Because yeah, the mind can work really quick. Like when you were talking, Dhamma, about sometimes it's a shoelace that sets you off. And this is something I'll sometimes notice, you know, with myself. And the thing is, is that what it really is too, this is not so much the shoelace, but it's the piling on, it's that mental formation, it's that coming together, right? And two, there can be stories of like, oh, well, you know what, this is all just repression and all that. We can tell ourselves all these different stories, right? But the thing is to see it right now and be like, hey, you know what, I can release this in a healthy way. I can change this, you know, I can take accountability. I don't have to, you know, throw a hissy fit, right? And to be able to change that. But I think one of the really powerful things there too is to to come back to that nurture, to come back to like, hey, congratulations, we spotted it now. Now we can break it up and we can make a wholesome change. And so yeah, that's another aspect too that I find to be quite helpful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the Piti or the wow factor of we can do this. And it's almost like secondhand Piti, like secondhand smoking when you see somebody else in trouble and you're not in trouble, you're like, well, what's the difference? Oh, like she lost her car keys, so she's freaking out. But you know, one day I'm gonna lose something, so really there's no difference. I can feel totally unattached when it happens to me. I have that beautiful choice to remain calm. To remain collected, to tell myself that everything's all right, right here, right now. And that's a big thing with the breath, is that not only does it give you that release, like, ah, like, who doesn't love that feeling of just letting go in that way, of just breathing in and completely letting go of, ah? Um, but also it's like Me and you have talked about before too, the breath, like Dukkha, everything becomes Dharma when you look at it. Like the Dukkha becomes the bell at the Zen center that reminds you, hey, remember to look. But also our breathing, when we, you know, maybe we have to remember to look at the breath, but once we start looking at it, the breath itself becomes just this continuous beautiful music. This beautiful bell reminding us, oh, your home's this way. And then the mind wanders to the past or wanders to the future, but you're aware of the breath and it's always that beautiful bell chiming you back home, you know. And really you never left. You're just like one of those boxers who keeps getting punched in the face and you start getting out of it. And then the referee puts the smelling salts underneath you and he's like, wake up. And then you come back home and you never really were gone, but your mind was just boom, somewhere else. But then it reminds you, hey, everything's okay right here, right now. There's no races to run. There's no mountains to climb. You can leave all this bullshit of the Western culture of climb over, stomp over everybody's head to get whatever you want achieved. Like, you can— like, I always liked what Mr. Rogers said back in the day. Are you familiar with Mr. Rogers?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he was always telling kids, like, you're perfect just the way you are. And I always thought that was such a beautiful message for children to hear, because just like Dhammarato says, like, this is what kind of starts the whole negative Sankhara is when you're younger, you know, you have to throw out the trash, you have to get good grades, all that nurturing breastfeeding, all that nurturing protection from the father. If you want that after the age of 7 or 8, you're gonna have to earn it. That once unconditional love starts becoming very conditional, and then people after a while work their asses off, and they look around and they're still miserable. Even if they are, quote, by societal standards successful, and all that money and all that power didn't really bring anything but more Dukkha. Then they have midlife crises.

**Speaker B:** And then.

**Speaker A:** They get a convertible and it makes them happy for a couple months until the car payments start rolling in, and then somebody scratches it at the grocery store, or somebody steals it, or even if nothing happens, the problem-creating machine of the mind will make something happen to validate its own existence in a weird way, to validate the illusory ego's own existence. You make up all kinds of excuses, like it can be perfect, and then you'd be like, well, I don't like this color. Actually, I think you did like the color, but you have these Samskara, these habits that are just like mental and physical habits that are just leading you away from your true nature, your true peaceful nature. If everything's fine, which it rarely is, you'll come up with the problem to keep you busy. Because that's what we're taught too at a young age. You can't be— you can never just not be busy. Like Thich Nhat Hanh says, like, the businessless man is a great man. To be businessless, you know. And we all start with that negative false assumption that something always must be done. God forbid you find yourself sitting. Oh, the idle hand's the devil's playground. You know, you're going to become a nobody. And it's like, good. I'll play with the devil. I'll become a nobody. It's better than running some rat race that leads to World War II and all kinds of dukkhas and all kinds of dissatisfaction. I'd rather be happy doing nothing, sitting on my couch in a peaceful way. If you look at the world, they have all these statues all over of great war leaders and presidents and people who have conquered lands. But you rarely ever see anybody in the Western world. This is more meaningful. But you don't see any statues of somebody sitting on their couch eating Cheetos. Peacefully, you know? But you'll have statues made of bronze and silver and gold of all these serial killers.

**Speaker B:** Like.

**Speaker A:** Why not have a statue of a peaceful person resting at home? It's like, well, that doesn't make sense. Actually, it makes perfect fucking sense if you open your eyes to reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's that thing with the restlessness, you know, society that you see where, you know, folks will have in their mind that it's better to do all these things that are actually harmful, to go out and fight, kill people, than it is to do nothing, than to be a loser by society's standards, right? That is far worse than going out there and committing, you know, these kinds of acts. Where I think like a lot of the population, you know, that haven't, is a good idea. They can recognize, hey, you know what, you haven't done that. To recognize, you know, the non-action sort of part of things of harmlessness, right? As opposed to, I mean, there can be that sort of incredibly negative aspect, right? That's sort of fed in. No, you're not doing enough. You need to do more, you know. But it's funny because, like you said, it's, you know, there's all these ideas of all these great men, you know. And like, yeah, great. Sometimes it's like, yeah, exactly. It's like, and what have they done? And in a lot of cases, you know, there's some pretty terrible things, you know. And I mean, like, yeah, we can have compassion and understanding for folks and what might have led somebody on on that path, right? And this isn't— I mean, this is something where I think the Dharma is very much about rehabilitation and that really anybody can change, right? But it's that sometimes we prioritize the wrong thing. We don't prioritize peace. Yeah, we prioritize getting stuff done.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a Dukkha shit culture of— it thrives on rolling around in shit. You know, and what is Dukkha? In a weird way, Dukkha can only exist in the conceptual realm of the past and the future. We say, no, you could be happy or you can be miserable in the moment. Yeah, but why are you miserable? You know, if you got a new Xbox console or new video game, and even if nothing's happening and you're worried about losing it, that's taking place in some fictitious future realm. Or if you're looking at your Xbox and thinking, um, man, all the work I had to do before I got that, man, I hope nobody steals it. That's the future. But also, if you think the reason I got this Xbox is, man, because my friend Tommy had one and I want one, and that's the past. It's like it's all rolling around in shit. It's like the correct way to do it would be like, oh, I have this nice Xbox, however I acquired it, whatever. And if somebody comes in and takes it, whatever. If it breaks, whatever. You know, if it makes me happy, whatever. And that reminds me of something Ajahn Chah said. I'm paraphrasing. I forget his exact words, but he was saying he really liked how one monk would always say like, or it was one of his teachers, I forget, but he would always say something along the lines— it was a bad translation in this book— but it's something along the lines of, oh well, it's like, so what, or who cares. Oh, I got enlightenment, so what. Oh, I broke my leg, so what, who cares. Oh, this happened, okay. Or just kind of saying like, okay, so what, that's not gonna affect my my Sukkha, you know. But the moment I start clinging to it, those temporary sense pleasures or those temporary physical pains, the moment I start clinging to those things, then the whole wheel of Samsara starts spinning and building momentum. And that moment is— that momentum factor is something that sometimes is It's not looked at, but it's good to remind yourself, like, just as somebody who's really earnest in their practice can build positive, wholesome momentum, and things will get easier, they will get easier, they'll get so easier. It'll go from, say your life is like 70 5% difficult, it'll go down to 10 before you know it. You know, and it's like, who cares? Like, it will get easier. But also, if you start deviating away from the Sangha, if you start worrying about this I, me, my mind, that momentum builds up too. And that's what leads us to the realm of Dukkha. It's not only the positive Samskara or habits, so to speak, but the negative ones. It works both ways. You know, you can deteriorate before you know it. And it's insidious, meaning it's slow moving and it's widespread. But if you remember to look and change, it's easy peasy, easy peasy to get rid of that Dukkha, or to change that Dukkha rather, into something more wholesome. That's the name of the game really, is just remember to change the unwholesome to the wholesome. Come back to that breath. Our doorway home that leads us to our true peaceful nature that's always been there. And it will deviate, like the Buddha said, it will not last. That's what takes off a lot of practitioners too. They get to these wholesome states and they forget the Buddha's teachings. They forget Anicca, you know, they forget impermanence. And that's why Dhammarato is always reminding us these things aren't going to last forever. And when they don't last forever, which they surely won't, that's when we have to change the unwholesome back to the wholesome, then come back to the breath, then enjoy our peaceful nature in this Sukkha state that will not last, and then we change it again. And in that way, it does in a way make it last. When we realize that nothing lasts, in a way it does continue this cycle of Sukkha for us. Which is what they call Nibbana, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think this is something that, you know, as I continue to practice and develop and look, is that balance in terms of when it comes to Anicca, right? Because sometimes there can be like, okay, everything is changing, and that can kind of get into a thing of being, well, there can be almost a feeling of pointlessness at times, right? If it's seen the wrong way. But I think what is helpful is that no, we can continue to develop and cultivate these wholesome states, right? But recognize Anicca, recognize that things are in flux. And the way that we get into those wholesome states, or we recognize them, is through emptying out. It's through dropping the attachment any particular phenomena. It makes it much easier when we can just come back to, hey, this breath right now is enough. Not last Tuesday's breath, not tomorrow's breath, but this one with whatever qualities come, whatever qualities go. It's fine just the way that it is, right? And we can play with it. We can make it long, we can make it relaxing and all that, right? But recognize, hey, these qualities, they come and go, and that's okay. Right? But we can still develop the ability to see that, to recognize that, to know that, know that freedom, right? Rather than being like, oh no, just because everything is changing, I'm inevitably going to fall back into Dukkha. So what is the point? It's like, no, it's continuing to develop that, remember, look, change, because again, we might, right? We, and that's why I think remembering too, yeah, that first noble truth that there is Dukkha, because that builds the appreciation as well. It builds the enthusiasm and the, hey, we can do this, we can keep looking, we can keep changing, we can keep developing these skills of the Noble Eightfold Path. And it can be a very joyous thing. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There's Dukkha because we forget to change it. Yeah, yeah. And a lot of— sometimes people, yeah, like you were saying about Anicca, they confuse it with nihilism. And it's like, no, it's not nihilism. It's not— it's not everything's like, well, if everything's impermanent, what's the point of practicing Buddhism? It's like, no, that's nihilism. The point of practicing the Dharma is gladdening the mind here and now. And that's the brilliance of what the Buddha discovered. If it was just meaningless nihilism where it doesn't matter, he would have said so. But, you know, there was Nibbana. There is Nibbana. And he says so with the— and it's one of his first things, the Four Noble Truths, and then the Eightfold Path. You know, there is the way we perceive life incorrectly causes this Dukkha. And there's a way out of it. Or like Dhammarato says, which I like, is like, he also says the doorway to the Eightfold, it's here. It's not something you have to climb the mountain and run the race for. It's available now. And you build the confidence, you cultivate the joy, and it becomes much easier And it's actually, if you give it a chance, much more easy than you would ever have thought otherwise. It's as easy as breathing peacefully.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hi Piti! Hi Karuna!

**Speaker A:** I love cats. Yeah, cats are like little Buddhas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, little Buddhas, little Zen masters.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they're just, uh, they're so present. They're so, uh, not complaining. They're so, uh, Sukkha-filled. Sometimes with my facial expressions, people think that I'm not like happy or joyous. But I always have to tell people, there's like this famous meme on— not meme, but there's a couple TikTok videos that are like, "I'm not angry, I'm just indigenous." So if you're like indigenous or to North America, you kind of have these or if you are what they call Hispanic but is really indigenous, you kind of have these like facial expressions of just— but really you feel great.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So sometimes when I'm meeting new groups of people, I have to remind them like, I may look terrifying, but actually I'm feeling good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I think that's funny too, because like thinking about it in terms of change and You know, yeah, when it comes to smiling, right? It's like, yeah, sometimes, you know, it can be really nice to smile and all that. But sometimes we can just kind of go into a very relaxed, like, sort of, you know, just let the face like completely ease, you know. And sometimes, you know, maybe to others it doesn't like look like the most—.

**Speaker A:** Smiles come in all shapes and sizes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Sometimes there's smiling big and bright internally. So even if— yeah, but it comes and it goes. Yeah, so, you know, if we have a rule like we have to be smiling all the time, you know, it's.

**Speaker A:** Like, you know, that's called Disney World. Yeah, you don't smile, you don't get your paycheck.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it's interesting too because like, you know, coming into the Dhamma And also like here where we really emphasize the wholesome thoughts, right? Is there something where, you know, in terms of investigation and looking into it, because I know a lot of the time people do talk and it's a pretty popular thing about like toxic positivity of like always be happy and all that stuff. But I really do think that again, especially with the wholesome versus the unwholesome, this is very, very different. Because it's not saying like, okay, you have to be happy all of the time, no matter what, you got to put on that smile. And especially because a lot of the time that is from like the perspective of not acknowledging reality, the fact that, hey, we're all going to get old, we're all going to get sick, and we're all going to die. Now, can we still be happy with that? Can we still be happy recognizing that? That's part of it, because what's stepping into the wholesome is actually embracing reality. And sometimes things on the surface don't seem particularly sunshiny and rainbows. But the fact that there is what is, is being like, hey, you know what? We can accept that. We can move on. We don't need that.

**Speaker A:** That's a good point. Like, if somebody's mother dies and you see them at the funeral crying and mourning, Don't confuse their crying and what appears to be like crying and mourning with Dukkha. To them, they might really enjoy crying for somebody who cared for them their whole life that they love dearly. That might be their Sukkha, and it can be disguised into looking. But then somebody with ignorance might come in and say, you know, you're not really practicing changing that to Sukkha, look at you, you're like— No, I'm experiencing a natural beautiful process that sure may be painful, but like Sukkha itself comes from the mud of Dukkha. And it may appear, and it may even be painful, but it is a beautiful natural process that helps us to move forward and to heal in the moment. You know, there's such things as growing pains. Although pain is often associated with Dukkha, it doesn't have to be. Yeah, you can have pain and be delighted, in a sense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because that's the interesting thing, because if you look at Piti, Samuppada, right, it's like the feelings are, in a sense, before the Tanha, or even the attachment, right? Or, yeah, like it's sort of like there's feeling tones, and there can be pleasant or unpleasant. And, you know, sometimes, yes, if we're like really looking, we can just see it as sensation, and we can break it down even further, right? But the thing is, is like, yeah, sometimes things are unpleasant. That's okay. Can we be okay with that? Right? And sometimes, yeah, if we're like with somebody in that situation, I think that it's very helpful to be like, hey, you know what, we can be here, we can have that understanding, we can have that nurture, passion, and allow them to be with their emotions as well. Right. And I think that's the thing too, is it helps as well when we can allow other people to be with their emotions.

**Speaker A:** That's why not judging is a really wonderful thing, because you might see another Buddhist, so to speak, or whatever they like to call themselves. And be like, oh, he felt this way about this. You don't know his heart. And that's— I even remember reading in some of the suttas Buddha saying like, worry about yourself. I know Jesus said that. Don't look at the logs in other people's eyes, or don't look at the splinters in others' eyes when you have a log in your own eye. But in this sense, they might not even have splinters at all. No, if somebody I love dies and I'm crying To me, it's all part— it's as natural as death. It only becomes suffering when I just don't want it. Like, oh, this is happening, I don't want it. It's like, no, I understand it's a part of life. And let me have my delightful Sukkha morning of crying for somebody I love, of doing that. Sure, it may be a little painful, but there's no problem for me. But often we'll look at other Buddhists and say, oh, look at all their problems, look at how they should be acting and shouldn't. And that's why Ajahn Chah warned a lot about be careful how you're perceiving others. It's not really important. What's important is how you are perceiving and changing your own mind. So.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, precisely like that, just like it's very helpful to be on the lookout and to keep looking like, you know, when we catch that is like, oh, is there aversion here? Is there aversion to this situation? Right? And all that stuff like here that is causing like a dissatisfaction when if we're like complaining about others or the way that others are behaving like, well, and that's the thing is to yeah, like, you know, even when we are kind of observing and whatnot, what have you, others to keep looking back and to see what is going on here. Has this arisen? Has aversion arisen? Has ill will arisen? Has greed arisen? Right?

**Speaker A:** And again, that's— and complaining is a bit different because mourning could be more easily mistaken for Dukkha, whereas complaining almost is always Dukkha because it's the projection of things are not the way I want, and I'm going to talk about it, damn it. Talk about it, because misery loves company. But the crying is— the crying or mourning, they're not hurting anybody. They're not asking you to join their pain, you know. But when someone's complaining, they kind of are having a proverbial hand grabbing you toward them, saying, come join me with my complaining about every goddamn Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** But then it's like the trick, right, of like, oh, not stumbling into complaining about, you know, they're complaining, and just to recognize, wait a minute, that's not the most helpful thing. I don't have to pick that up. I don't have to take that in. Maybe there can be some like wholesome, you know, redirection here and there. But that's sort of the thing I think, like, really to be aware of and skillfully engage with, like, in today's climate too, right? Is like, how would you do that, right? Because like, sometimes, yeah, people, yeah, things do happen and what have you. And sometimes if you just tell them straight up, yeah, you know what, you got to fatten up, you got to cheer up, that's not going to work, right? You got to kind of be like, not sneaky with it, but you know what I mean? You got to be skilled with it if you want it to to really come in. And sometimes that's like just listening and like sort of being like, okay, cool, right? We don't have to pick it up and then gently sort of guide, as opposed to being like, oh.

**Speaker A:** You got.

**Speaker B:** Nothing to complain about, because they might not get that. Because they'll be like, might even have.

**Speaker A:** The opposite effect of somebody who might have been a great practitioner in the, you know, now because of something we've said or criticized, now they're no longer even interested in the Dharma, which is sad too, you know. Well, not sad, I guess it's just the way it is, but something that can be avoided, something that could skillfully be avoided, like you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Work around that skillfully. But yeah, it's kind of— yeah.

**Speaker A:** God gave us a brain, so let's use it. And speaking of— speaking about God is funny. Like Zen Master Seung Sahn, sometimes when he would do some teachings, some new people who didn't— weren't familiar with him, he would talk about the soul, he would talk about God, and they would raise their hands right away and be like, that's not in the Pali Canon, that's not Buddhism, that's but they have the ignorance, they fail to realize he's not attached to these descriptive words, you know. Everybody has their own things that help them. Perhaps some Buddhists like talking about God, and if it— and they're not attached, they're not attached to— I always tell people, like, sometimes I feel like I believe in God 100%, and at the same time I don't at all. Like, I'm very atheistic in some sense, but to me, it's not a problem. Like, it's just something that's always balanced, you know? It's not something that comes up where I— you start the Dukkha, you start rolling around in the Dukkha shit once you start getting attached to these labels. Once you start getting attached to I'm a Buddhist, we can never talk about God, we can never do this. Like, okay, enjoy that attachment, buddy. But I'll be over here free speaking in whatever poetic way I feel, you know. And if that's not good enough for you, go throw a pity party. That's okay.

**Speaker B:** You know how the Buddha talks about, you know, the Dharma as the raft and laying it down. I think this is another aspect of that, of like, hey, recognize when this is going to cause more harm than good, right?

**Speaker A:** And if we're being skillful with our words.

**Speaker B:** That's true. Exactly. We don't have to communicate. And this is the thing, we can communicate in ordinary language, or we don't have to be so fixed in these things, if it's gonna lead to conflict. And we can see, hey, this, yeah, this is not, there's not going to be really any benefit to this. You know what I mean? But if people perceive and they're like, oh, you know what, that was kind of worded skillfully, and oh, that actually kind of makes sense. I'll kind of open up a little bit more to it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because it's really like any other, quote, religion, it's really easy to get pretty close-minded pretty quick in Buddhism. You know, especially if you start donning a pair of robes or a robe and, you know, a bowl and stuff and shave your head, then you really start having Mara speaking very sweetly into your ear, like, now you're somebody, now you're better than everybody else. Now, you know what I mean? And you do have to be skillful. You can't just go around saying I'm a Buddhist and then like preaching Satanism.

**Speaker B:** You can't.

**Speaker A:** But you do have to be skillful. But I think whenever I'm talking about the Dharma, talking about God, it never really has ever— if it ever comes up, it's always in that teaching that it's okay. Like, there's nothing negative with talking about God. If you are bringing negativity to those words, it's coming from your own end. I see no problem with saying there's a God or talking about a God or saying that there was a beautiful wise man named Buddha. But if somebody else has problems with these words, they're creating it. See, there are certain words you can say that you could almost be sure that a lot of the negativity will always be from somebody else, because you're not challenging them with a word that's.

**Speaker B:** Like.

**Speaker A:** Something really negative. You're just saying a neutral word— to me is neutral— like God. But if you say that word and somebody starts giving you trouble over that, that's their own problem, you know? That's their own attachments.

**Speaker B:** That's interesting, um, too, when it comes to, you know, word God and all the various different things that can come with it, because there's like some things like where it's like, okay, well, it's, I mean, to, from what I can see, it's like, okay, it's this, right? But so there isn't yet that, that holding on to it. I mean, like, there isn't so much, okay, there's this deity that, you know, does these things or what have you, but it's just like, is this right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And that's where people have false assumptions and judgments. If somebody says God like me, it can mean something totally different. So what do you have to do when somebody you think may have a different vocabulary or opinion? You need to talk with them, find out. Because when I use the words God and people talk to me, they may very well find out what I really mean is the Dhamma. What I really mean is the truth of nature right here and right now, and the beautiful teachings of the Buddha. To me, it's like Buddha Dasubhikkhu once said, he's like, everybody wants to cling to this identity of I, me, and mine. Like, if you want to live forever, if you want to cling to these souls and do this, he's like, cling to the Dhamma. Let the Dhamma be your self. If you need a self, let the Dhamma be it. And I'm like, I always loved that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, no, I think that's the funny thing, going back to the wrath thing, where I think that like, sometimes, you know, there can be a misunderstanding with it, or wanting to throw it down too quickly in terms of the Dhamma, or sometimes it's like, okay, it's time to apply it. And sometimes it's time to drop it. Right. And so that requires discernment. But in terms of The funny thing with like, yeah, clinging to the Dharma, one fortunate attachment, because it's the attachment that's going to shred all unnecessary, unwholesome attachments, right? It's like by sticking with that sort of point, and even with like, okay, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, it helps to alleviate and clear out all the, um, yeah, the garbage. So like that sort of thing, it helps keep things clear in a sense, right? Open.

**Speaker A:** I always like to say all Dukkha has attachments behind it, but not all attachments cause Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if you have Dukkha, 100% of the time there's always a negative attachment attached to it, but all attachments don't cause Dukkha. But Dukkha is caused by attachment, always.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But to make it in simple terms, there's unwholesome attachments and there's wholesome attachments. And what is an unwholesome attachment? Anything that causes Dukkha is an unwholesome attachment. Anything that causes Sukkha, peace, loving kindness, compassion, that's a wholesome. Anything that gladdens the mind here and now and rest assured that that is a peaceful, wholesome feeling or thought. And you'd be hard-pressed to find any Buddhists— I'm sure they exist— but if you're talking to somebody who's part of a Sangha, they usually don't. You could usually give them the benefit of the doubt that they're not trying to cause any harm. They're not trying to inflict any Dukkha on anybody. If they do so, it's merely out of ignorance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's another PSA too, is like, if you stumble across somebody who's rubbing you the wrong way in the Sangha, they're your brothers and sisters. Allow them to be who they are, you know. Help guide them, you know, and realize they're not out to get you. Most people Don't give a— like, I heard this on a TikTok the other day. I forget who said it. It was brilliant. But maybe it was David Goggins or something. He's like, but most people don't give a shit about you. You know, they just don't. You know what they're busy about? They're busy about taking their kids to school, doing their job, doing this. You're the last thing on their mind. You know, you're not that special. And that's a great thing. Because you don't want everybody thinking about you all day long, then you will become But I'm glad that people have their own lives. And usually in Sanghas, nobody's out to cause Dukkha. So you have to give them the benefit of the doubt, even when they do seemingly appear to make mistakes. And in the words of Ajahn Samadhi, don't take— I'm looking at the book right now— don't take your life personally. Don't take life so seriously either. Anyway, that's all I have to spew out of my mouth. You have anything else to add or say?

**Speaker B:** Not really. Nothing that needs to be said.

**Speaker A:** Awesome, dude. Yeah, it's about quality, not quantity. So if we get one or two more people really interested in the Dharma to come back next time to talk, how wonderful will that be? But if not, oh well.

**Speaker B:** That's true. It is a good conversation though, and I appreciate your spewing Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for listening to this, as Yugi Krishnamurti says, this dog barking. But anyways, you rock, bro. Hopefully I can exit out of here while saving the recording.

**Speaker B:** It'll do it automatically, so.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're awesome.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Much peace and love. Adios.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Dhamma)** with contributions from **Speaker B** and other Sangha friends, revolves around the core Buddhist practice of **mindfully transforming dissatisfaction (Dukkha) into peace and contentment (Sukkha)** in daily life. Here is a concise summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Practice: Remember, Look, Change**
The central method discussed is a simple, moment-to-moment practice:
1.  **Remember:** Cultivate the habit of "waking up" from the autopilot of daily life, which is often designed by ignorance (Mara) to lure us into craving and distraction.
2.  **Look:** Observe with mindfulness to detect the subtle arising of Dukkha (stress, dissatisfaction) in thoughts, feelings, and situations.
3.  **Change:** Actively shift unwholesome thoughts and feelings to wholesome ones. The primary tool for this is **returning to the breath**—the ever-present "doorway" to peace and our true, satisfied nature.

### **Key Themes and Insights**

*   **The "Monster" is a Puppy:** With practice, what seems like overwhelming suffering (a "giant monster") is revealed to be manageable and empty of real threat (just a "small puppy"). Freedom comes from seeing this directly.
*   **Building Wholesome Momentum:** Like lifting weights, consistent practice builds mental strength. The goal is to make the "remember, look, change" cycle a habitual, positive momentum that makes peace easier to access.
*   **Learning from Observation:** One can learn detachment by observing others in distress. Seeing their attachment and subsequent suffering, while oneself remains relatively undisturbed, provides a powerful lesson in applying the same non-attachment to one's own "fictitious self."
*   **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Attachment:** Not all attachment is bad. **Wholesome attachments** (to the Dhamma, to gladdening the mind, to kindness) lead to Sukkha and ultimately help shed unwholesome ones. **Unwholesome attachments** (to sense pleasures, status, fixed identities) always lead to Dukkha.
*   **Impermanence (Anicca) is Not Nihilism:** Recognizing that all states—both joyful and painful—are impermanent is not a reason to give up. It’s the key to freedom. It allows one to enjoy Sukkha without clinging and to meet Dukkha without despair, continuously returning to the present breath.
*   **Skillful Communication and Non-Judgment:** The Dhamma should be shared skillfully and compassionately, without rigid dogma. Avoid judging others' practice (e.g., how they grieve) or getting attached to labels (e.g., "Buddhist," "God"). The raft of the Dhamma is for crossing over, not for carrying unnecessarily.
*   **Counter-Cultural Peace:** The talk critiques societal values that prioritize restless achievement, busyness, and acquisition—all sources of Dukkha. True peace is found in being "businessless," content, and free from the "rat race."

### **Illustrative Examples**
*   **Zen Master Seung Sahn:** Facing serious heart problems, he reframed it joyfully: "The doctor said my heart is making music."
*   **Observing Others:** Watching someone devastated by a loss, while you feel compassion but not the same devastation, reveals the possibility of non-attachment.
*   **The Broken Shoelace:** Often, it's the accumulation of small, unattended annoyances that causes outbursts, highlighting the need for constant mindful "check-ins."

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**
The conversation is practical, encouraging, and down-to-earth. It emphasizes that enlightenment or peace (**Nibbana**) is not a distant goal to be achieved, but a present-moment reality to be accessed through simple, consistent practice. The path is about **gladdening the mind here and now** by remembering your capacity to change your relationship to experience, using the breath as your anchor and home.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Buddhist practice, mindfulness, and overcoming suffering. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**

1.  **Mara as a Monster/Puppy:** Speaker A describes the distractions and temptations of the world (personified as **Mara**) as initially appearing like a "big angry monster." However, with practice and clear seeing, one realizes it's not a threat—it's just a "little puppy" (attributed to Jiddu Krishnamurti). This symbolizes how our perceived sources of suffering are often illusions born of fear and ignorance.

2.  **The Rat Race / Chasing Cheese:** Enlightenment or happiness in Western culture is compared to a "rat chasing cheese"—a futile, goal-oriented pursuit of an external reward, rather than recognizing it as something already present within.

3.  **The Budding Tree vs. Giant Oak:** Dissatisfaction (**Dukkha**) is likened to a "young little budding tree." The practice involves catching and addressing it early, before it grows into a "giant oak tree" of overwhelming suffering.

4.  **The Breath as a Doorway and Bell:** The breath is described as:
    *   A **"doorway"** to the present moment and our true peaceful nature.
    *   A **"beautiful bell"** at a Zen center that chimes to remind us to return to awareness when the mind wanders. It's a continuous, gentle guide "back home."

5.  **Lifting Weights / Exercise:** Developing mental skill and peace is compared to physical exercise. You can't become the "Incredible Hulk" overnight; it takes consistent, right effort over time to see "real changes" in the mind.

6.  **The Boxer and the Smelling Salts:** The wandering mind is like a boxer who gets punched and dazed. The breath (or awareness) acts as the "smelling salts" that the referee uses to wake the boxer up, bringing consciousness back to the present.

7.  **The Raft:** Referencing a classic Buddhist parable, the Dharma (teachings) are a raft used to cross the river of suffering. Once across, you don't carry the raft; you "lay it down." This metaphor is used to caution against clinging dogmatically to labels or concepts (like "Buddhist") when they become unhelpful.

8.  **Swimming in Enlightenment:** We are said to be "swimming in enlightenment" but can't see it due to delusion. This contrasts with the idea of enlightenment as a distant mountain to climb.

9.  **Rolling Around in Shit:** Samsaric existence and a culture focused on external achievement is bluntly described as a "Dukkha shit culture" that "thrives on rolling around in shit." The path is about stepping out of that.

10. **Captain of Your Ship:** With right effort and attitude, you "become the captain of your ship," taking control of your inner state rather than being tossed by external conditions.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **Zen Master Seung Sahn's Heart:** When asked about his serious heart problems, the Zen master placed his hand on his chest and joyfully said, **"The doctor said my heart is making music."** This story exemplifies transforming physical suffering and impending death into an occasion for joy and acceptance.

2.  **Leo Tolstoy's Dissatisfaction:** Speaker A references Tolstoy, who, despite immense fame, wealth, and success, felt he had committed every evil and found no happiness. This story illustrates the futility of seeking lasting satisfaction in worldly achievements.

3.  **Mr. Rogers' Message:** The children's TV host's mantra, **"You're perfect just the way you are,"** is cited as a wholesome, non-conditioned message that contrasts with the "conditional love" society often teaches, which leads to craving and performance-based self-worth.

4.  **The Buddha's Advice on Observing Others:** Speaker A recalls a sutta where the Buddha advises observing others in grief (e.g., over a lost family member). Noticing that you are not devastated as they are reveals the power of non-attachment. This "observing" becomes a practical lesson for applying non-attachment to one's own losses.

5.  **Bukowski's Broken Shoelace:** Referencing poet Charles Bukowski, Speaker A notes that sometimes it's not major tragedies but tiny irritations—like **"the broken shoelace when you're running late"**—that can catalyze a breakdown. This highlights the importance of mindfulness in daily, minor annoyances.

6.  **Ajahn Chah's "So What":** Speaker A paraphrases the Thai forest monk Ajahn Chah's attitude: whether it's enlightenment or a broken leg, the response is a detached **"so what"** or **"who cares."** This illustrates the ultimate non-clinging to *all* phenomena, pleasant or painful.

7.  **Statues of War vs. Peace:** The speakers note that societies erect statues of warriors and conquerors, but not of **"somebody sitting on their couch eating Cheetos"** peacefully. This contrasts society's valuation of violent action over peaceful non-action.

### **Summary**
The metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist principles (**Dukkha**, **Anicca**, **Anatta**, mindfulness) concrete and relatable. They emphasize themes like:
*   **Illusion vs. Reality** (monster/puppy, rat race).
*   **Cultivation and Process** (budding tree, lifting weights).
*   **Present-Moment Awareness** (breath as doorway/bell, boxer).
*   **Non-Attachment and Perspective** (observing others, Seung Sahn's heart, Ajahn Chah's "so what").
*   **Cultural Critique** (statues, Mr. Rogers, conditional love).

The dialogue uses these illustrative tools to advocate for a practice that is simple, immediate, and focused on transforming one's relationship to experience here and now.
