### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I chose— okay. Okay, so I chose that no matter how much I wanted to be irritated, or how much I wanted to get frustrated, that I was just going to let that be. And instead, just be like, wow, anyway, just wow, anyway. And what I've noticed is that today there has been less unwholesome thoughts in general. There has been a more positive feel-good baseline to my energy. In fact, I didn't do 4 to 6 meditation sits today because I forgot. I was enjoying. So I was so focused on my here-now practice that it didn't occur to me. It was like, oh, I got to meditate.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll meditate later. Oh, and then I meditated. I did like about— I did two. I did two sits. And what I noticed in those two sits is it was much easier to focus on the breath. It was much easier to be here in the now because for the entire day I've been practicing being here in the now. Now, that is the victory. Okay, there's a victory. I do have a however, only because this is tough, man. This is— I gotta be honest with you. So it has gotten to a point where I'm starting to see that the irritation and the frustration is just there. No matter how much I'm like, wow, or oh, this is great. It all— sometimes it feels when I say wow, or oh, this is great, is it feels like I'm trying to convince myself. But it's like, kind of. It's not working. It's, it's bullshit. It's not letting me just enjoy it. And I'm seeing all of that, which is good, seeing all of that. But it's like what's happening now is, man, it's still the same thing is happening, right? Where I notice I'm not being present, but now what's happening is I'm getting upset about it because I feel as though I cannot budge this irritation. It's just, it's stubborn. And then, and then wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'll do you one better. I'll do you one better. Remember what you told me? Remember what you told me? You said when I see irritation, I could be like, ah, I see irritation. I see you, I see you. Okay, no, no, no, I see you wanting, I see that tendency to go be irritated. Wait a minute, I don't have to do that now. And then it'll happen again and again

**Speaker B:** and again and again and again, and I'm exhausted.

**Speaker A:** And I don't know if the irritation is just there because it's there, or it's coming from doing this exercise, or if it's just already there, or what. But that's where I'm at.

**Speaker B:** All right, so we've got 3 things to talk about now. Yeah, the first thing to talk about is that you use the word background In the sense of background thoughts.

**Speaker A:** I don't even remember using that word

**Speaker B:** when you were talking about washing the dishes. So the next part is, um, uh, the, the point about, um, what you just mentioned, that things keep coming back and, and coming back. And the third item was that statement of you ought to be meditating when the wow that we're talking about is the meditation. That is the practice. No, I know.

**Speaker A:** And I noticed that. I noticed that. Yeah. My girlfriend was like, well, it's not— I don't think it's that you're not meditating. You're just doing it in a different way. And I'm like, yeah, you're actually right. I've been meditating all frickin' day.

**Speaker B:** And the reason that that's true is because of the Western Buddhism view that has been presented as Buddhism as a meditation hall full of meditators, probably all dressed in white, right, sitting on white cushions with mahogany or brown floors or whatever like that. All right. So the whole idea then is meditation is done sitting down to where in the suttas we're talking about all of the postures. Right. Right. And so that's the important thing, is to recognize that it's the practice of what we're doing, not any postures that we take.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't know, Dhammarato. I don't think I let that go a long time ago.

**Speaker B:** Well, a lot of people don't.

**Speaker A:** I did. Yeah, I mean, I'm just letting you know just for your reference.

**Speaker B:** But then you came and said that you weren't meditating when then you were going around doing it and not recognizing. So we're actually just adding to the definition of the word.

**Speaker A:** What'd you say?

**Speaker B:** You suggested— we're just adding— we're just adding to the definition of the word. We're broadening the scope of— yes, um, and in fact possibly we could go so far as to throw out the word meditation because it never belonged to Buddhism in the first place, that that's an old Christian thing. Okay. And that meditation is almost always synonymous with contemplation. Okay. And that the meditations will have an object of contemplation. Okay, so in that regard, we can say, okay, well, there is something similar because we do take objects of contemplation, but the objects that we take is not something abstract or something magical like the Trinity or the Holy Spirit or whatever it is that is contemplating on. Rather, what we're contemplating on is the here and now, right now, what's going on in the present moment. So we can use that word contemplation, but a much better word for what we're actually doing would be practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, practice.

**Speaker B:** The practice of being here now. So whenever you're practicing being here now, that's the practice. Or we can say that's the meditation.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so I've gotten a lot of

**Speaker A:** this stuff from Dan, too, by the way. So some of what you're saying isn't the first time I've heard it.

**Speaker B:** All right. Well, that's the whole point again, over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Repetition.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. This is like music. It is sometimes exhilarating and interesting to go to, let us say, back in the old days where there was real concerts with a whole symphony orchestra and that Beethoven or Brahms or whoever was the dude on the block at the moment was coming out with a brand new symphony. And everybody gets excited to go to see, get all dressed up, becoming aristocrats for the evening and all of that kind of stuff. Except that nowadays with recording, that musicians, that in fact the people who were there in that place that we were talking about, that, that performance, that concert, the people who were getting the most out of that music were not the people who were hearing it for the first time. It was the musicians had been performing it and practicing and doing it over and over and over and over again. And that it generally— I've actually been in symphony orchestras to where we only played the whole piece of music one time in what is called a dress rehearsal, and then we play it one time for the performance. And so we only played the whole piece of music twice. All the rest of the time was playing a little bit here and playing a little bit here, playing over and over and over and over and over again. Okay, this is the quality that musicians have learned. And so this is also the quality that we need to bring into our practice. I understand. Recognize that this stuff is old and that, let us say, the child who is beginning to learn to play the piano, his fingers are not skilled. He doesn't have the motor memory, he doesn't have the muscle, he doesn't have a whole lot of stuff going for him. But by playing it over and over and over and over again, like just one measure, especially if it's like a credenza or something like that, Um, or maybe a passage, or maybe the revolutionary attitude. You just keep playing that over and over and over and over again, that one sequence, over and over and over again until you get it down. Okay, so that's the quality that we're going to be bringing to the practice. Yes, because you've gotten the idea that once you get into the wow, it's going to be easy to maintain. But no, We are looking at two skills that have to be developed. The first skill is the skill of getting into a really good state, and then the next one is to be able to sustain that. And that's what you're practicing now, the sustaining it, because look how much guarding you're having to do and look how many, let us say, immigrants you have to throw out. You have to deport these dudes over and over and over and over. And you think there's a flood of them. Well, yes, in the beginning there is a flood.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** no, it's not. Nuts is opinion of failure. The better way to do it is just one more, out you go, got that one. The next one, out you go, got that one. Okay, always keep coming back with that feeling of wow, that feeling of success. That's the important point is to go with this, because you're like everyone else. When we're talking about the Dharma and we talk about yous and mes and specific examples, really we're always talking about the general human condition. Uh, and so every one of us has everything, just in various, uh, let us say Triggering mechanisms change, but the emotions are the same. And when the triggering mechanisms change, that means that we fall into having frequent triggers keep triggering us over and over and over again. And so we keep giving the same responses over and over and over again. All right. And so this is what gains personality, is this one guy gets triggered with this over and over again, and that guy gets triggered with that over over and over and over again. Okay, so that's the point, is that we all get triggered, but our responses to the triggers are a little different, and the frequency based upon the triggers. But we all have this, and the natural condition of the mind over time goes into getting triggered more and more often. And so we get into a habit pattern of thinking in a certain way. And what you're doing now is you're interrupting that. Congratulations. Start to congratulate yourself for every time that you can catch that and move back out of it, because by doing so, you're actually building, as it were, mental muscle memory.

**Speaker A:** So why after all day, when I've noticed that I was in and out of thoughts, and then came to the present moment. By the way, I want to make sure, I want to clarify one thing. I want to make sure that we're on the same page about this. There's no actual wow experience I have when I realize that I've been going off of a stream of thoughts. I've been off in my head in other thoughts unrelated to what I'm doing. There's no wow experience. I'm saying wow, and, oh wow, look at that, to kind of— what you've encouraged me to do is to cultivate an appreciation for coming to the present moment, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** So I want to make sure— cultivating

**Speaker B:** that, and it's not working exactly as well as you want it to. Yes, but that it's almost like— okay, here's an example of it. Imagine that the swimming pool has not been cleaned or kept. And so over weeks, there has been dogs playing in it, leaves have fallen in it, the dirt has gotten stirred up out of the atmosphere, falls in the water, and the pool gets dirty. Let us say that it's gotten really dirty and so that you can actually look at the pool and see it dirty. Yeah, right. Yeah. Now we're going to turn the cleaning machine on and start to clean the pool. As we clean the pool, we can see evidence of the cleaning. But your average Joe Blow is going to come off the street and look at the pool and say it's still dirty.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right. But look at all the cleaning that you've been doing. You've gotten a whole pile of trash out of it. Right. But we also have to turn on the filter and start filtering and cleaning the water also. But even as the filter is getting gunky and pulling the dirt out of the water, the still— the water looks dirty. Still, but it's not nearly as dirty as it used to be, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, that's true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is the way that we're going to look at it, is you keep looking back at the dirty swimming pool rather than looking at how much work you've already put into it and the fact that you're getting things cleaned out. So give yourself that congratulations too, that you can begin to recognize that, wait a minute, even though that stuff keeps coming back in the mind, it's not coming back with the intensity. It's not coming back with the frequency. It's not coming back with the grabbing the mind and holding the mind the way that it used to, which could be considered part of the intensity. But it doesn't actually grab you and it doesn't actually come so often. Why does it not grab you? Because you're waking up to it and you're seeing it.

**Speaker A:** Well, it does. It does still come just as often, I would say, just as often. What's happening is is, you know, me realizing I'm going off in my thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Well, since you didn't see it before, how do you know that it's, uh, just as often now as it was before? But in fact, look at all the mind moments that you have spent in, in wow or in satisfaction. Your, your girlfriend is even saying that she can see it, and now you're not recognizing, you're not giving it credit because you think that, um, All right,

**Speaker A:** all right, all right. I congratulate myself. I congratulate myself for all the work I've been doing. Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yes, great. And that— keep with that appreciation rather than, um, have— let us say your existential life position is now shifting. Basically what we can say is, is that it's not shifting slowly in one direction, but it's finding itself plopped here and then plopped back.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And plopped here and then plopped back.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And it's almost like that as soon as you get up on here, all of a sudden you lose your grip and you just slide back in. Oh, what the hell? And so I got to take the effort again to go back in and then it slips back out.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yes. And the effort, I would say the effort is Wow, that's the effort. And it's exhausting me. It's exhausting how much effort that is. It feels like I'm cleaning a freaking pool.

**Speaker B:** It does. Exactly. And so the point then to take is, is that yes, you do get tired. Yes, the pool is dirty. Yes, you are learning how to clean it. Congratulations. Don't expect results that way. Get— the results are going to be in the moments that you are actually like picking that dirty rubber dolly out of the— wow, look at that. I see that come out of the— never mind, into the trash it goes. Okay. But and so what about be happy for the stuff that you are seeing? Friends with the garbage and the pool.

**Speaker A:** I— and I— listen, I had your voice in my head all day. I was doing that. I was— I literally— I went to the bathroom, I was about to take a shower, and I noticed I didn't want to— I didn't want to brush my teeth, I didn't want to floss, I didn't want to take a shower. I just wanted to watch a movie. And I was like, oh wait, look at that. Wow, dissatisfaction. Look at that. Your mind's already rattling off thinking about how it's going to be so upset and disappointed in doing this other thing. Well, who says? Who decided that? I can interrupt that. I have a say. No, no, let's do something else. I can feel good right now. And all the while I'm saying that, there's this sense of looming and ever-present irritation of— Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** That's the, that's the idea of the background, that even though you're doing it right, that stuff is always there, right? That's the kind of way that— and

**Speaker A:** it's instantaneous, it's simultaneous.

**Speaker B:** Well, guess what? It's not actually simultaneous. That— let us say it this way, that you've got two computers or you've got two cell phones in your hand, both of them are simultaneously operating, but you can only look look at one and then the other and then the other and then the other. This is a way of looking at it. And in fact, these are not background thoughts. They are thoughts that are in the queue or in line. And that's the thought that comes to the window. And then the next thought comes to the window and that guy goes away and then he comes back again, back to the window. Okay. And so whatever is going on, it's only going on in this moment and only, let us say, kind of one thing at a time. And this would be the way of understanding that is about consciousness. Now, the way that I figured this out was by understanding at the, let us say, the very deep hardware level of about how a CPU operates with cycles, that a cycle means one instruction cycle. And one instruction, it can be a fetch or a store or whatever like that, but the CPU can only have one cycle at a time. Now, the thing of it is, though, is that in mainframe computers, there's the mainframe computers actually have highly specialized machines or highly specialized computers. For instance, a channel computer that's managing the I/O for a mainframe, to where on the PC they do it with a simple bus. There's really no electronics hardly there in an SATA. But with the mainframe, they've got computers that are actually managing the the traffic into the main CPU, but still the main CPU has only one instruction cycle. Then in fact, multiple CPUs have gotten very complicated. But this is a way of understanding the human mind that we only do one instruction at a time. But that instruction is happening. Those instructions are happening so fast, very fast, that in fact, the— let us say the instruction cycle for the human mind is variable. But it can vary down to the level of 100 milliseconds is the average time for an alpha wave, which is the kind of the instruction cycles that the human mind works on. Now, in that instruction cycle or in that mind moment, another way of talking about it is that we can do some things. One of the things we can do is have a thought. That thought may not be fully formed. It could be just a flash of an image, or it could be just the color. Let us say that someone has their laptop set up so that their email screen has a particular color to it. Let us say a dark red, a particular dark red. Okay, so anytime that that color flashes into the mind If it has emails associated with it, it didn't take but a second, a tenth of a second, and it was only the flash of a color. But then the next thing happens is the feeling of, oh no, I've got to go write that email. And now we start thinking and spinning about that email one cycle at another, after another, after another. And now you come in and wake up and say, aha, I don't have to think about that email. And then we think about the email, and then we— aha, I don't have to think about the email. Yes, good. And then thought of the email comes back over and over and over again. But it's just one thought moment at a time. But right now, anything that we could do with these thought moments— go ahead and we'll get back to that.

**Speaker A:** The thing is, when I come and say, oh wow, that is that right there, when I say that That's noticing, oh, I've been working on all these emails, right? And then when I say wow, I realize, oh wait, I was working on all those emails. This is what it is. I don't actually realize that I've been working on all those emails until I do in that moment. And then once I do in that very, very, very split hair of a second, I can see, oh, okay, this moment right here is not spent on working on emails. This moment right here is spent in seeing that I was working on email, on seeing that there were thoughts going on that I was engaged in. I was trailing away. What happens when I say, wow, The next second later, or just a little later, is, oh shit, there's the irritation. I'm irritated. But is the irritation from saying wow? Because I'm having to say it so many times.

**Speaker B:** Okay, now that— yes, here's the point now. Irritations, agitation, worry, stress, all of that kind of stuff is actually chemicals in the body. While the mind moment spins very quickly at a tenth of a second, one of those mind moments in fact can be the mind through the pineal glands turning the adrenaline faucet on full tilt. For a short period of time and then turning it back off. But now that adrenaline is in the system. This is where the breathing comes in, that you can actually then breathe away the tensions and the anxieties that happen. Okay, so the tensions, the feelings are slower. The mind is very fast. The Buddha, in fact, is— there's a sutra, is one, is one of the joyful ones. I mean, it's a really juicy one. It's in the ones where you're talking about just one thing. And the Buddha says, the mind, oh monks, is so fast, I don't even have an analogy for how fast the mind is. Well, now in modern times we have nanoseconds, but in the time of the Buddha, he didn't have anything like that. And so there was no way to measure mind moments. But now, just on the internet, an example of this will be there's programs that measure reaction time. And how they do that is they'll have the screen completely red and then they'll change the screen to green. How soon after the eyes see the green change of the screen can you click the mouse? And then the software measures that time period. Okay, reaction times for very high quality fast reaction is about 200 milliseconds, which is 2 mind moments, which is the first mind moment is to see it, and the second mind moment is clicking the mouse. Okay, so this is one of the things that you can experiment with, is to begin to see how fast the mind is. Is it— can you get it down to that mouse click done in 200 milliseconds?

**Speaker A:** Now, the thing is, Dhammarato, is like, this is— I'm sorry, this whole thing is kind of— it's driving me crazy a little bit. It's driving me crazy because every, like, every 30, 40 seconds or so— What

**Speaker B:** specifically is driving you crazy then? And it is a craziness of giddiness, or is it a craziness of not liking?

**Speaker A:** No, not liking, not like.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's the point that you need to see, that those points in time of not liking, where are they? Are they in fact not— is it something in the body that you're not liking? Is it the feeling of the adrenaline in the system that you're not liking? What actually is it?

**Speaker A:** It's every 30 to 40 seconds. When I say wow, and then, and then feeling honestly, actually there's a feeling, there's good, there's a good feeling of, oh, I recognized, that's great. And then like a hair of a second later, it's, it's It's almost like disbelief. It's almost like it's just disappointment. Maybe it's doubt. Like a half a second later, it's just disappointment. It's like, oh, I have to do this again and again and again and again and again and again. Before, I was upset.

**Speaker B:** But the musician doesn't mind the repetition. It's the child practicing, who doesn't like to do it over and over and over again. But when the skill is developed, the musician loves it. He loves that repetition. Okay, so wait a minute. Let's just hang on for a second. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh man.

**Speaker B:** Sati is something that's new, this practicing of waking up and seeing what's there. Samsara. Every one of us is already in the habit of thinking that we know who we are. And so we kind of don't like surprises. And yet Sati, the waking up process, is to begin to see things that are really there that we didn't think were there before because we weren't looking for it. Okay, an example of that is, is that the guy is in his basement and he's looking around and he finds termites. He doesn't like those termites. He doesn't want them in the house. He wants to go get rid of them, and he does it with great anger and hatred. But he does not appreciate the fact that those termites would have done a lot of damage in his house if he hadn't found them. So he should congratulate himself for having bound the termites so that now he can do something about them. So from that perspective, as a one-time shot, what we're actually understanding is, is that you're beginning to see stuff inside that you have not seen before and you don't like it at all. You're beginning to see this tension that keeps coming back and coming back and coming back in a new way. You kind of knew it was there all along, but now you're seeing it more deeply. More specifically and more often, and you don't like it a little bit.

**Speaker A:** You're talking about the tension that I experience when I congratulate myself, when I am trying to show right effort to myself, when I'm trying to cultivate an appreciation for something. Right there on the other side of it is anger or irritation or tension.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That's what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations for seeing that. It was already there, but you had to kind of move out of it, and then you saw it as you moved back into it. If you had been sitting there all the time— the example is a fish doesn't know the water that he's swimming in as water. So you— one thing that you know, that when a fish gets put onto the boat without the water, they really flap around.

**Speaker A:** Well, let me say this, then you

**Speaker B:** will know when he's put back in the water. So what we're talking about here is, is that you're beginning now, because you're moving in and out of it, you're beginning to see it in a new way than if you had just been sitting in it or dwelling in it or doing it over and over and over again. Because you're doing now a new mind moment of wow, and then you go back into it, you don't like it. Where before it used to be old and comfortable and familiar, even though it was painful, it was still old and comfortable and familiar. Now that you're moving out of it and then the mind moves right back into it, you don't like that.

**Speaker A:** Hmm. So what you're saying is that this whole time I've been a fish flapping out of the water, like with air, no water for my gills, but learning to— learning to live that way. And then when I get put in the water, I'm like, whoa, I didn't know this was possible. I didn't know there is this whole other— there is this whole other alternative way to experience life.

**Speaker B:** But you could also say that because of some circumstances, or let us say triggers or conditioning or whatever, and in this case it's like the other line, the fishhook line. And so the fish gets back in the water. Wow, it feels so good. And then he gets jerked back into the boat. Okay, so maybe that's that kind of analogy is backwards. The original point of view that I was wanting to take is that the fish is used to the water, but he doesn't know he's in the water, that the fish really understands the water. Because he comes out of it. Okay, so this is what we're looking at in that regard, is that you are stuck in tensions and you spend a lot of mind moments in there and you're not even aware of it. You're not looking at it. And now with Sati coming up and you're coming out of it, now when you go back into it, you can see yourself going back into it because you're alert and awake now. But the stuff comes back. Yeah, right. That's the habit. It's always— it's not always been there, but it keeps recurring over and over and over and over and over again. And then you're over here patting this and you say, wow, that's really nice. And now you come back over and pat— wait a minute, I don't like it now. Well, you've been doing that your whole life, but now you're comparing it against something new and you like the new one a whole lot better. But you're still in the habit of doing it the old way. So that means that we need to continue to practice. And one of the ways of practicing is by recognizing when it does come back, that is, hello darkness, my old friend, or it's aha, I see you, Mara, or now we're guarding the mind in a new way. You see, the whole quality of guarding is also wrapped up with the quality of sustaining wholesome thought. So, OK, so that's the whole trick of it, that we have to develop the skill of getting into those moments of, wow, this is really nice. And then when the invitation to go back into the teaching We can say, aha, there's that tension again, and I don't have to go there, I can come back. But as soon as the tension comes back, because your habit pattern of not liking, you just jump right into that tension rather than saying, wait a minute, I don't have to have that.

**Speaker A:** So no, no, I've been doing that too. I've been— what will happen is, I know I don't have to have that, I don't have to go there, and then it'll happen a second later.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. And then you say, I don't have to go there this time either. Every second later it comes back.

**Speaker A:** Every second.

**Speaker B:** Well, but every second's 10 mind moments. That means that 9 moments you're spinning out of it, and 1 mind moment it comes back and you don't like it.

**Speaker A:** It's probably every 5 mind moments, honestly. Or no, oh no, no, well, it doesn't matter. That's the— it's a 10th of— it's like a 20th of a second. It's very fast.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is. It's very, very fast. And it— that then the tension triggers you not liking it. What we need to do is to keep that grace going, that wow sensation, so that when the tension comes back, you can say, wow, the tension. But you immediately, because of your habit, you go into the state of not liking it. So watch that not liking it, the divine moment that comes back. Rather than just say, aha, I see you, Mara, and throw it back out again, and then it comes back again, aha, I see you, Mara, and throw it out again. When for you it comes back, you could say, aha, I see you, Mara, and throw it out. And then it comes back again and you say, what the hell are you doing back here? I threw you out already.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's exactly like that. And I'm working so hard.

**Speaker B:** Oh my God, work so hard. Instead, don't try to keep it out. Make sure that the effort, the right effort that you're putting in, is that that feelings, those thoughts are not going to take over. Which for you they are, because the habit is, is not liking. So the first thing that we need to practice is just keep getting yourself back into a good state, knowing that it's going to pull you right back out. Never mind, get back into a good state, and then it pulls you all the way out. Never mind, get back into a good state, and it pulls you out. But the next time it starts to pull you out, you say, wait a minute, I'm not going to go this time. I'm going to stay in a good state.

**Speaker A:** I just want to— I don't think we're on the same page about one thing. It's not necessarily a good state. When I say wow, I'm not experiencing a good state, Dhammarato. It's not necessarily a good state. What it is, is just noticing that my mind was somewhere else rather than the present moment. It's not a good state though. It's not like how I feel necessarily when I'm getting up from

**Speaker B:** a seclusion session. What would it take for you to get yourself into a good state?

**Speaker A:** Maybe like 2 to 5 minutes of breath, focusing on the breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay, maybe just a few breaths. I don't know. Okay, right. That's the way that— so start experimenting with that. But so that the wow that you're saying is not false, it's real. You really do have to Talk to yourself in a real way about, well, this dish that I'm washing is really okay. I really like this dish.

**Speaker A:** But what if I don't like it?

**Speaker B:** Well, then examine that. Why are you not liking a dish? What's the point of not liking it.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, man, I feel like I've lost it.

**Speaker B:** I feel like— No, you haven't. You're actually— This is an important question for you here. Let's ask that same question in this way. If you— Which would you prefer, being in a wow that's a false wow that has the tension come back, or would you prefer to be in a really nice wow that lingers?

**Speaker A:** Really nice. Wow, that lingers.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's your choice.

**Speaker A:** I just don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do that.

**Speaker B:** Well,

**Speaker A:** um, I think— is that— wait

**Speaker B:** a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You do know how to do that. You just want to do it more often and more better.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** You do know how to do it. You can do this. You know that you can do it. You're just still at that level of dissatisfaction. This is an important point about Sati that I was starting on. Let's go back and put it on again. Is that the wake-up process is to wake up to what's real. And we often, because of our prior conditioning, we think that we're something different than what we are. And when Sati comes in, in real investigation, we begin to see what we really are. And we don't like it a little bit. You see that tension. Which is real, and you don't like it. And you're not liking the tension is going to bring more tension. And you're not going to like that, and there's going to be more tension. But when you do see the tension with Sati, the gladdening of the mind is, okay, there's tension there. Hello, tension. Let's take a deep breath and breathe with you. Can I play with the tension? Can I make it bigger? Can I make it smaller? Can I make it go in and out while I'm breathing in and out? Can I manipulate it take control over it. See, one of the mistakes that most of us make is we think that the tension, number one, is bad. Number two, it should not be here and I want it out. Okay. Those are the ways that we look at it. And all of those are going to keep us in the negative, ordinary state of mind. That is not the issue of the tension itself. It's the issue of your attitude towards the tension. And right now you don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Can I— can I say, hello darkness, my old friend? Can I make friends with this tension even if I'm not in a wow state?

**Speaker B:** Yes, absolutely. That's in fact the way to do it, is to deal with it in whatever state that you're in and recognize it as it is and that it's okay to deal with it as it is.

**Speaker A:** Am I supposed to be at this point? Did you think that I was experiencing more of a wow state than I actually am? Am I doing— I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

**Speaker B:** Honestly, no. But you have been feeling like you've been doing something wrong for your whole life. That's an old, old friend of yours.

**Speaker A:** My God, so many old friends.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the feeling of that you're— that you're doing it wrong, that you're messing up, that this is not good enough.

**Speaker A:** Why won't they die?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Can't they die now? Can't they just die?

**Speaker B:** No, they don't.

**Speaker A:** What are they, immortal?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no, they're temporarily arising due to conditions. Yeah. And as you begin to change the condition, and in this case the condition is the not liking,

**Speaker A:** so was I

**Speaker B:** just having something different than it is instead of just enjoying the way things are?

**Speaker A:** So was I just doing a whole bunch of false wows today? How do I know?

**Speaker B:** No, no, don't judge. That's the whole point. Let's be here now rather than trying to figure out what happened during the day. Let's just do it now. I can enjoy this present moment.

**Speaker A:** Okay. What is the difference between a false wow and a real wow?

**Speaker B:** I would say that both of them are real, and one of them is just subject to the critical mind, and the other one was nurtured. But they were both real wows. One of them was subject— you just judged it as not a wow. It wasn't real. This is not good enough.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, that's what's happening. That's what's happening.

**Speaker B:** As soon as I say— now that you can see that, in fact, I like that you're getting excited that you can see that, that you go around making things unsatisfactory intentionally.

**Speaker A:** I just said it's not good enough again. What happens when I say wow right there? It's like the other side of my hand. I say wow, not good enough. Wow, not good enough. Wow, not good enough. They're like attached to each other.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so wow, good enough. Wow, wow, wow. Wow,

**Speaker A:** I've been doing that all day!

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, you haven't, because when it comes out, it's a subtle wow, but I don't like you, and you need to see that you are sabotaging. But it's not you in particular. This is not a, um, a condition unique to you. It is the way the human mind works, and that if you're in the pattern of doing this, even if you get out of it for a moment, you get right back into it. It's almost like a dud. Um, you know, the example is a muddy dirt road, and that muddy dirt road has had a lot of your traffic over and over and over again, and so you've got ruts and potholes and all kinds of things in that road, right? Just because at this moment you can swerve around the pothole doesn't mean that now you are 100% expert at avoiding potholes. And in fact, by thinking about how wonderful it was that you missed that last pothole, you wind up in the next one. Okay, but the whole road is muddy. And what we need to do is we need to learn to drive right through the potholes, right through the ruts, drive right through them. Most beginners, when they're going down a muddy road like that, they want to go very slowly because they want to make sure that everything is special. And they're the ones who get stuck. The ones who just drive right through it, they're the ones who wind up happily on the other end. But that takes skill to drive right through it. OK, so this is what we're talking about here, is that the wow comes and then the mudhole, and you want to not drive right through it. You want to stop and complain, oh, I don't want that pothole in my road.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. No, but I, but I do want to say there were times today when I did drive right through it. I did drive right through it. It was more, but it was still there. It was still there. The irritation, the tension.

**Speaker B:** No, it came back. Don't say it's still there.

**Speaker A:** No, it was still there when I drove through it.

**Speaker B:** You just recognized it was still there later. The first mind moment is the first you have this, and then it's the next mind moment. You can't have both sides of the hand up at exactly the same time. They were in different mind moments. Okay. Okay. That's the first thing to understand, is that you had it and then you lost it. So go get it again and then you'll lose it again. Go get it again and you'll lose it again. Go get it again and you'll lose it again. Go get it again and you'll lose it again. That's the way that it works because we're developing a new skill. Now, the people who have no skill, all they've got is the tension. But now they're not even looking at the tension. So the tension and the problems are there. They're just not paying any attention to it. The first thing that you can do is you can congratulate yourself because you can see the tension. You can see it. Congratulations, you can see it. Am I supposed to jump back into it?

**Speaker A:** If I could really see it, wouldn't I be able to see that I've been doing it this whole time?

**Speaker B:** Um, well, you're pretty critical on yourself.

**Speaker A:** I can't, I can't see that I've been doing it this whole time.

**Speaker B:** What, the tension? Are you saying— that's a good question then. Do you think that this tension is brand new, or is it something that you have discovered?

**Speaker A:** Well, if I've discovered it, wouldn't that be new?

**Speaker B:** Well, the discovery is new, but the fact that you have been talking yourself into being tense and uptight, I think, has been ongoing for quite a while. Otherwise, why would you even be trying to do some meditation if you weren't already knowing that there was some dissatisfaction? But now you're beginning to see it more clearly.

**Speaker A:** Maybe I don't need to worry about it. I don't need to think about it.

**Speaker B:** You don't. That's the whole point, is that you're— what everybody does is they're taking a look at something that's been there for a long time that they haven't seen before, and they don't like it at all. It's just.

**Speaker A:** It's just amerado. I. I understand everything you're saying and I appreciate it. There's just a neuros, a neurosis that is coming with this. Like it's day in, day out. Every second I'm like wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. I feel exhausted from it. Like, what can I do about that?

**Speaker B:** For one thing, you're putting too much effort into it. How about a wow? Okay, a relaxing wow. See, your wows are excited wows. Let them become happy, relaxed, peaceful wows, like the wow of, wow, I just saw you again. I just saw it again.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I was thinking I could do that, but— and I tried it, but I did try that tonight before we got on the phone. I was thinking, man, maybe it's just the excitement. Maybe I can just be like more quiet to myself about it, more gentle about it. And as I noticed that I was doing that, the irritation was still there.

**Speaker B:** It keeps coming back. A better way to say it, that's one thing that we can start to say, is not that it's still there, but that it comes back, that it comes back, that it comes back. Okay. The example is a new field that has been newly plowed and the plants are planted there. But there's a whole lot of weeds that keep coming back. Okay. Western farmers are really just overly complaining about weeds. We have Monsanto and other companies who were really into putting out all kinds of poisons to take care of the weeds. Right. But if the farmer goes in and pulls one weed after another, after another, she might be able to get her garden fairly clean of weeds until next year. And here they come back again. Again. The weeds keep coming back. Now, in Thailand, they grow food differently than that. They never plow any of the fields. They just take the natural habitat that has all the plants that are already there. They don't call any of them weeds. They just plant what they want to plant right there in the middle of— and that's where we live. In fact, the word for it in Thai is sawan. It can mean garden But it also means a forest or a jungle that about, let us say, a half or two-thirds of the plants that are planted around the house here were planted by humans. But all of the other stuff was never pulled up by the humans. So this is a way to begin to understand that, yes, you are going to have tension, but you don't have to weed that thing, just enjoy the garden of the fruit that you can plant. And that as you continue to do that, the weeds will become less important. So that's a way of thinking about it, is that you're not necessarily having to pull up everything thinking that, oh, now that I pulled it up, it's gone. No, what we're doing instead is planting a garden right alongside of that. So that we're spending more and more mind moments in our garden and less and less mind moments pulling weeds. And here you are finding a whole bunch of new weeds that you haven't seen before, and you're madly trying to get rid of them so that you can enjoy without the weeds there, rather than recognizing that, no, this mind moment— just because the next mind moment may be a frustrating mind moment, this mind moment I can enjoy. And when that frustration comes, never mind. I don't have to dwell on that weed. I don't have to go grab it and pull it up and hang it or whatever like that. I can just ignore it or put

**Speaker A:** it— I see you, I see you,

**Speaker B:** yeah, I see you— and just throw it aside and come back and have a pleasant moment again. Go for your— the fruit of the practice rather than trying to murder the weeds.

**Speaker A:** It's interesting, you know, because I think you're right. I think I'm seeing the fish in the water, like I'm seeing

**Speaker B:** that I

**Speaker A:** never realized that this was the water that I was in. And now that I've seen what it's like to be out of the water, it's like Well, why wouldn't I want— why wouldn't I want to keep that? So,

**Speaker B:** except that you don't, that things keep changing. Yeah, back and forth and back and forth. But you have a choice about paying attention to the fruit rather than paying attention to the weeds.

**Speaker A:** Paying attention to the fruit rather than paying attention to the weeds. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** yeah, the tension is there, but now the tension, you can start to play with that as if it were a piece of fruit. How do we do— how do we play with the tension? Can you locate it in the body? Do you know where the tension is? For most, it's in the chest area. So when you're breathing in and out, you can actually feel the tension, and so you can breathe into it and play with it. Can you breathe it out? And then when you breathe back in, it comes back. Then you breathe it out again. So begin to play with it as a toy,

**Speaker A:** okay?

**Speaker B:** It's a toy to play with, because they're playing with it as a toy. This is the Sati, this is the practice. Not liking it is just the old way of doing things, and that not liking it keeps that going. If we have to put up with something we don't like, isn't that tension? And you don't like the tension. By not liking the tension, you keep it going. So first thing, number 1, congratulations, Alex, you can see the tension.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha. Number 2, enjoy it. Enjoy playing with it.

**Speaker A:** You're breaking up, you're breaking up.

**Speaker B:** I said the number 2 is to enjoy it, to play with it, make it a toy when it comes. Aha, I see you. Attention, where are you? Are you on my left tit or on my right tit? Are you down in my belly or are you up in my throat? Where do you have it? Do you have me by the throat? Because a lot of people, they got themselves by the throat with their own tension and they got you know, like this. So where is your attention? Can you move it around? Can you find a place in the body that's tense? Can you relax it physically? So this is how we deal with it. We deal with it as if it were a fun game to play rather than a work to do to get rid of it because you're not supposed to have it.

**Speaker A:** How do you make it a fun game if the game is also to get rid of it?

**Speaker B:** Every toy breaks the more it's played with.

**Speaker A:** That's pretty good.

**Speaker B:** I should tell you about the Velveteen Rabbit. The Velveteen Rabbit, you see, the donkey, the Velveteen Donkey was sitting on the shelf and he was saying, look at my velveteen fur, it's just all beautiful and I'm so shiny and everything like that. And the Velveteen Rabbit says, yeah, I've had all my fur rubbed off with love. So that's how you're going to deal with attention. You're going to rub it until you love it off.

**Speaker A:** I just noticed like a couple of my moments ago, the thought, I'm irritated, went flashing off. And yeah, I just noticed it. Just noticed it. So when that happens, I can just

**Speaker B:** be like,

**Speaker A:** I see you. I see you.

**Speaker B:** You don't own me. I see you.

**Speaker A:** I'm here. Yes, that's over here.

**Speaker B:** Not the tension. The tension is out there. The tension is here. I am not the tension. I am not tense. I see it. I see the tension. And you begin to play with it like a toy. Like a cat with a mouse.

**Speaker A:** I will say, is it what the cat do?

**Speaker B:** They play for the mouse, he kills it. That's what he does.

**Speaker A:** Is it, uh, Dhammarato, is it normal, is it natural to experience some exhaustion from doing these practices?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is normal natural because the average Westerner works too hard, but it's not natural because you don't have to work so hard. But it's our part as part of our society that in fact we are taught that as a kind of a skill. An example of that is that do your homework. And so the child is there doing whatever he wants to do. But he is looking like he's struggling doing his own work. Okay. We have words built into our language like try. People who say, I'll try it, they have no intention of being successful at it. Okay. Now, scientists try stuff, but they try it because they think it's going to work. Work. A child tries it because he's told that he's got to do it, and he doesn't want to succeed at it, but he'll do it because he was told to do it. Okay, so which is the attitude that you're going to have? The attitude of trying to deal with the tension, or actually just playing with it?

**Speaker A:** There's tension right there.

**Speaker B:** There's tension, right? Right, but you see it. But look what you did with that tension. You laughed at it. There it is.

**Speaker A:** I got upset though. I got upset too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but look at the upsetness also. There it is. I see that too. Haha. Aha.

**Speaker A:** It feels like whether I'm saying wow or whether I'm saying Wow, there's still

**Speaker B:** like— it comes back again. Don't say still, says it comes back.

**Speaker A:** There's still an exhaustion is what I mean. There's an exhaustion.

**Speaker B:** The thought of exhaustion comes. Maybe one thing at a time, but it happened really fast, one after another after another after another.

**Speaker A:** It's tiring though in my head, like I feel tired.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's just a thought too. That thought can trigger, oh, let's take a deep breath.

**Speaker A:** But what about my body? Like, my body actually feels like physically exhausted.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're working either too long or too hard. Oh, you're wanting something. That's why you're working. You're exhausting because you're working. You're wanting something rather than actually experiencing that you're satisfied, because being satisfied doesn't require anything. Then in fact you can't feel satisfied while you're busy. You have to stop being busy. So take the effort out of it. That's one's right effort, is to take the wrong effort out.

**Speaker A:** I don't— I don't— I'm not sure I understand the distinction.

**Speaker B:** Well, the effort— okay, here's— here it is. The effort to stand up is a whole lot more effort than the effort to sit down. Takes muscle to stand up. Okay. And you're standing up to deal with things. And I'm saying, no, you don't have to stand up to deal with them. You can sit down to deal with them mentally. Take a rest. Ah, there you are. Never mind. So you say, there it is and I hate it. I got to go do something about it. Okay. No, you don't have to do anything about it. There it is. I can see it.

**Speaker A:** But also, but also, don't I have to be like enthusiastic about it or appreciate it? Like to appreciate

**Speaker B:** it is exhausting. The enthusiasm will grow with success. And right now you're not feeling it as success. So we start first with success, and as the success grows, the enthusiasm will grow. Okay.

**Speaker A:** I was at some point today, at some point there was like a climax in the day where I felt really successful. I felt really good. And then, and then after that, it was like—

**Speaker B:** Well, that's because you wanted to keep it rather than being satisfied with that. You lost your satisfaction. Yeah, I know that it's subtle. That's why we keep practicing over and over and over again to get ourselves into a state of satisfaction. And then can we maintain that state of satisfaction? We have to do that by guarding it, because the mind is very likely to go jump away. Now, one of the things about that is, is that keeping the mind on the breathing will help to not go off into the mind moments of thought that cause the tension.

**Speaker A:** But you mean, you mean even if I'm just like in a conversation with someone or watching a movie, to focus on the breathing then too?

**Speaker B:** Like I am now. I'm noticing the breathing. Not absolutely every breath. But most of them, but more attention on them, but more attention. Okay, but you don't— you probably don't

**Speaker A:** have to do that, right? Because you've been doing this for so long.

**Speaker B:** Well, I do because I like doing it, because it's pleasant to remember the breath, right? Take a deep breath and just, ah, it's so nice, everything is good. So allow the tensions to be there. It's okay that wanting them to go away is going to keep them here. But if you say they're okay, that's all right, let me look at it, let me play with it. The breath to relax that tension. Use the breath to play with that tension. Find out using the breath where that tension is in the body. For most people, it's in the solar plexus and the sternum. In this area right in here is where most people experience it. Some people, it's up higher in the chest. Others have a lot of sadness with it, and so the feelings go lower into the belly. But now that you can locate it where it is, now can you move it around? Can you start to put your eye into areas around it to see if you can kind of move it around? Where is it exactly? Can you move it a little bit? That we could do this actually with an itch that you see. We think that the mosquito bite Let's see if we can find out. Okay. This would be because we can see it right there. We would say that that's where it itches. But in fact, the whole area with a lot of different cells. So if I focus exactly on that one point, then I can recognize that while I'm looking at that, I can feel the itching or the sensations around it. So let me go look over there. And when I go look over there now, the attention returns back to the point that I was looking in the first place. So we can begin to move it around, chase it around, find out exactly where its center is. Where is— where is the one dot point in your body where the tension is the strongest? I bet you can't find that because it's a generalized area kind of thing. Well, if it's a generalized area, then where are the boundaries to it? Can the boundaries be moved also? But if you don't like it and want to avoid it, then you don't get to know it at all. So the first thing that we do is we say, hey, I got a new toy to play with, attention. So let me go examine it, play with it. No more than a couple of minutes.

**Speaker A:** Why would I want to do that?

**Speaker B:** Because the other possibility is hating it and doing what you're doing now and not making any progress.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, if that's the only other possibility, then yeah, that's pretty convincing for why I would want to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can either love it or hate it, but you can't get rid of it right now. But loving it and playing with it and massaging it is going to be a whole lot more advantageous for getting rid of it than hating it and avoiding it and trying to ignore it, hoping that it'll go away on its own. It's not going to go away on its own. It's going to keep coming back and coming back and coming back.

**Speaker A:** You're saying play with it for a couple minutes a day or a couple minutes at a time?

**Speaker B:** Whenever you see it, when it comes up, when you recognize it, hey, it's a new toy to play with.

**Speaker A:** It comes up all the time?

**Speaker B:** No, not all the time.

**Speaker A:** Not all the time. Not all the time. It comes up when it comes back after I notice that I was in it, basically.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it comes up when you can see it. It when it— when you do see it. Yeah, that's to play with it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** As soon as you get yourself satisfied, then you become dissatisfied, which is a whole lot better than you just being dissatisfied and not knowing. So here you get into satisfied, and then you go back into the dissatisfaction. And the way to manage your satisfaction is to begin to play with that which you would have been dissatisfied with.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I understand.

**Speaker B:** Satisfaction with playing with the tension rather than being dissatisfied with the tension when it comes.

**Speaker A:** I see it. Yeah, I see what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why is it better to understand why is it better to see that there's something else possible other than dissatisfaction, that satisfaction is possible other than dissatisfaction, and why is it important to see that I've been dissatisfied this whole time but didn't know it? Why wouldn't it be better to just be dissatisfied this whole time and not know it? Because if I don't know it, Isn't

**Speaker B:** that somewhat— guess what? Most people make that choice. That's the choice that most people make. That's the choice that ordinary people do, that they think that it's, well, it's a tragedy, but it's not that big a tragedy. I can put up with it. I always have. And I guess I can continue to do it. And basically it's the mentality of either number one, I can't change, or number two, it's not worth the effort. And so most people stay ordinary people, even if they have an opportunity to practice correctly. Most people who start meditation don't continue doing it. But if you can learn to become successful at it, and know that you're successful, knowing that you're satisfied with what you're doing, that will grow the enthusiasm, and then you can really be on the path. So most people don't. So the question is, can I teach the students how to become satisfied so that they can make that change out of the ordinary life into the noble existence, because most people don't do it.

**Speaker A:** Dan describes this process as becoming very ordinary again, not special. Yeah, that we're at— that actually all those people you're talking about are special.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're all special.

**Speaker A:** You and I are much more ordinary.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the— that's the direction that we're going, is to recognize that, yeah, the tension is ordinary and I can deal with it. It, where most people think that their attention is extraordinary and, and is difficult and hard to deal with. Okay, so most people are victims thinking or hoping that they're going to be at least special victims, or they're wanting to come out of their victimhood so that they can be special. We were taught as children that we're supposed to be special. And we have to perform and prove that we're special. But if you can come to the point of you don't have to prove anything, you could be ordinary and just sit back and enjoy ordinary. So you have a world full of special but unhappy people, and then you have an occasionally a few people who were both ordinary and quite happy at it. I know that there's a catch-22 in there because that ordinary and special has to do with quantities, and so special is unique or not ordinary in the sense that they're not frequently had. So then special people are very few of them, and ordinary people, there's a lot of them. Except that all of those people who are actually ordinary think of themselves and have been taught that they're special. Okay. And those who are wise see that, oh no, everybody is ordinary and that's okay and everything is fine. And so by being ordinary, they become special. But ordinary people never become special because they think that they're already special.

**Speaker A:** Oh man, such a trip.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Yes, and then that's the whole point. So let's enjoy the show. We don't have to fix everybody. That's up to them. Each one of us, each one of us has to fix our own mind. You can't fix other people's minds. All you can do is share your joy with them. And so that's what I'm doing with you, is sharing my joy. Yeah, attention is there, so what? It's not a problem, not an issue. Not a worry. That's the way to think. I can be satisfied even when moments of tension come back. That's okay. Can't touch me. Okay, so another toy comes by, just another toy.

**Speaker A:** So to recap, the first thing is when I noticed that there were other thoughts that were going on, and I come to this present moment, I see the present moment again. It can be a wow. It can be a wow. It can be a wow. It can be— it doesn't even necessarily have to be out loud, right? Because I've been doing it all day. It doesn't have to be out loud now. It can just be like a breath. It could be awesome. It's great. And then if irritation is there, Well, then it's like, oh, irritation. So it's like I'm regarding the present moment and everything but the present moment the same, with the same gentleness, with the same nurturing, with the same appreciation almost. Because in getting upset at the dissatisfaction, I create a war, basically, like this is better than this. And if I'm having this, then I'm not happy with this. And if I'm having this, then I'm not happy with— if I'm having this, then I'm not happy unless I have this. So really, what's required is just whenever there's irritation, like you said, play with it, invite it, it. Just let it— just appreciate that for what it is and take control over it. And yeah, yeah, take control over it

**Speaker B:** rather than letting it control you. You can control it. Hi, old friend, I see you. And then you play with it like a cat would play with a mouse. Yeah, so you take that teaching, you throw it up in the air, you see how it lands. You see, though, it landed right back where it came from. Okay, well, let's throw it over that direction and see where it lands. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, let's finish now because I got a couple of other people who are looking for Yeah, I was going

**Speaker A:** to say, I heard your phone ringing earlier. So cool.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** It helped too.

**Speaker B:** So go play with this. Go practice playing with the fact that, yes, things, the old stuff keeps coming back. So what? So what? Yeah. Your job is to not jump in it.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And go with it. Right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** My job is to focus on the fruits. Fruits of my labor.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, stay with the fruit, stay with the garden. Okay, all right, okay.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Dharma. Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** See you soon.

**Speaker A:** See you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a practitioner's (Speaker A) experience with integrating mindfulness into daily life and the challenges that arise. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Practice: "Wow" - Cultivating Appreciation for the Present**
The practitioner describes trying to use the word "**Wow**" as a tool to interrupt unwholesome thoughts (irritation, frustration) and cultivate appreciation for returning to the present moment. This all-day "here-and-now practice" led to positive results: fewer unwholesome thoughts, a better energy baseline, and easier formal meditation.

### **The Central Challenge: Persistent Irritation & Mental Exhaustion**
Despite the success, a major difficulty emerged:
*   **The "Wow" felt inauthentic at times**, like trying to convince himself.
*   **Irritation felt stubborn and ever-present**. Every time he recognized his mind wandering and said "Wow," a wave of irritation or disappointment would follow almost instantly ("Wow, not good enough").
*   This created **exhaustion** from the perceived constant effort of "cleaning the pool" of his mind, only for the "dirt" (irritating thoughts) to immediately return.

### **Dhammarato's Key Teachings and Reframes:**

1.  **Redefining "Meditation" as "Practice":** He broadens the definition. True practice is **"the practice of being here now,"** whether sitting, washing dishes, or talking. The goal isn't just formal sitting but sustained mindful awareness in all postures.

2.  **The Analogy of Skill Development (Like a Musician):** The mind's habit patterns are deep. Developing mindfulness is like a musician mastering a difficult passage through **loving repetition**, not a one-time achievement. The two skills to develop are: (1) entering a good/pleasant state, and (2) sustaining it.

3.  **Shift from "Fighting Weeds" to "Cultivating a Garden":** The practitioner's approach was like desperately trying to pull weeds (irritation) from a garden. Dhammarato advises:
    *   **Stop the war.** Don't focus on eradicating the "weeds" (negative thoughts/feelings).
    *   **Focus on the "fruit."** Spend your mind moments in the pleasant garden (appreciation, satisfaction).
    *   **When a "weed" appears,** don't engage in battle. Gently note it ("I see you") and return your attention to the garden. The goal is to spend more time with the fruit, not achieve a weed-free mind.

4.  **"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend" - Making Friends with Tension:**
    *   The irritation and tension are not new; you are simply **now seeing them clearly** because you're contrasting them with moments of awareness.
    *   **The problem is not the tension itself, but your attitude of "not liking" it.** That aversion creates more tension.
    *   **Advice:** Play with the tension like a **new toy**. Locate it in the body. Breathe into it. See if you can move it or change its boundaries. Investigate it with curiosity instead of rejection. This "loving it off" (like the Velveteen Rabbit) is more effective than hating it.

5.  **The Mechanics of Mind: One Moment at a Time:**
    *   Dhammarato explains that consciousness processes one "mind moment" at a time (incredibly fast, like a CPU cycle).
    *   The feeling of simultaneous "Wow" and irritation is actually two sequential mind moments.
    *   Therefore, you can't be "in" both at once. When you see irritation, you are already out of it for that moment. Your job is to **choose not to jump into the next mind moment of "not liking."**

6.  **Right Effort vs. Striving:**
    *   The exhaustion comes from **wrong effort**—striving, trying too hard, wanting a result.
    *   **Right effort** is simpler: gently guiding attention back to satisfaction or to playful investigation of the tension. It's about **relaxing into awareness**, not standing up to fight.

### **Conclusion and Recap (by the Practitioner):**
The practitioner synthesizes the lesson:
1.  Use "Wow" (or a breath, or a gentle note) to appreciate returning to the present.
2.  **Regard everything in the present moment—including irritation—with the same gentle curiosity.** Don't create a war between "good" (presence) and "bad" (irritation).
3.  When irritation arises, **"play with it,"** investigate it, take friendly control of it. Don't let it control you.
4.  **Focus on the fruits** (the pleasant moments of awareness) rather than obsessing over the weeds (persistent negative patterns).

The ultimate message is one of **gentle persistence, self-friendship, and a shift from being a victim of mental habits to becoming a playful, ordinary observer of the human condition.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato, Speaker B) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the meditation practice and the challenges of dealing with persistent thoughts and irritation. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **The Dirty Swimming Pool:** This is the central metaphor. The mind is compared to a dirty, neglected swimming pool full of leaves, dirt, and debris (unwholesome thoughts, irritation). The practice of mindfulness ("wow," noticing) is the process of cleaning it. The key insight is that even as you clean, an observer might still say "it's dirty," but you should congratulate yourself for the progress (the pile of trash removed) rather than focusing on the remaining dirt. The dirt (irritation) doesn't disappear instantly; cleaning is gradual.

2.  **Musician Practicing:** The repetitive nature of noticing thoughts and returning to the present is compared to a musician (or a child learning piano) practicing a difficult passage **over and over and over again**. At first, it's frustrating, but the skilled musician comes to love the repetition. The goal is to develop "mental muscle memory."

3.  **The Gardener and Weeds / The Thai Jungle Garden:**
    *   **Western Farmer (Weeds):** Initially, the mind is like a weedy field. The common impulse is to aggressively pull every weed (fight every negative thought). This is exhausting and feels like a battle.
    *   **Thai "Sawan" Garden:** A better approach is to be like a Thai gardener who doesn't clear the whole forest. They plant the desired fruit (wholesome states, satisfaction) right among the existing plants ("weeds"). You focus on nurturing the fruit, spending more time there, and the weeds become less relevant. You don't have to eradicate every weed, just don't dwell on them.

4.  **The Muddy Road with Potholes:** The habit pattern of the mind is like a deeply rutted, muddy road. Swerving to avoid every pothole (every negative thought) is slow and gets you stuck. Skill means learning to "drive right through" the potholes—acknowledging but not being derailed by them.

5.  **Computer CPU / Mind Moments:** The mind's operation is compared to a computer's central processing unit (CPU) executing one instruction cycle at a time, very rapidly. Thoughts and feelings arise in discrete, sequential "mind moments" (estimated at ~100 milliseconds). This explains why you can't have two conflicting states (e.g., "wow" and irritation) in *exactly* the same instant, but they can alternate extremely quickly.

6.  **The Fish in Water:** The practitioner who has lived with tension and dissatisfaction is like a fish that doesn't know it's in water. The practice of mindfulness ("wow") is like being pulled out of the water (noticing the tension). Now, when you fall back into the "water" (the old state), you recognize it for what it is and don't like it as much. The discovery is new, even though the state is old.

7.  **The Velveteen Rabbit:** To encourage playing with tension instead of fighting it, Dhammarato references the story of the **Velveteen Rabbit**, whose fur is loved off through play. Similarly, you can "love" the tension away by engaging with it curiously rather than with hatred.

8.  **Immigrants / Deportation:** Intrusive thoughts are compared to immigrants trying to enter a country. The practice is like being a border guard, calmly deporting each one as it comes: "out you go." The point is to do it without drama or a sense of failure.

9.  **Standing Up vs. Sitting Down:** Wrong effort is like the hard work of standing up. Right effort is like the ease of sitting down—it's about *relaxing into* the practice, not straining.

### **Stories & References:**

*   **Symphony Orchestra Rehearsal:** The story of musicians rehearsing a piece by playing small sections **over and over**, only performing the whole piece once or twice, illustrates the depth and repetition needed in practice.
*   **The Buddha on the Mind's Speed:** Dhammarato references a sutta where the Buddha says the mind is faster than any analogy he can give, underscoring the CPU metaphor.
*   **Finding Termites in the Basement:** Seeing your own irritation is like discovering termites in your house. While you don't like them, you should congratulate yourself for finding them so you can address them, rather than just being angry they exist.
*   **"Hello darkness, my old friend":** This lyric (from Simon & Garfunkel's "The Sound of Silence") is suggested as a way to greet returning negative patterns with recognition rather than alarm.

### **Core Conceptual Reframing:**
*   **Meditation Redefined:** The talk reframes meditation from a formal sitting practice to **"the practice of being here now."** Any moment of mindful presence is the meditation.
*   **"Wow" as a Tool:** The word "wow" is a tool to **cultivate appreciation** for the simple act of waking up to the present moment, not necessarily to generate a euphoric state.

**In summary,** Dhammarato uses a rich tapestry of metaphors (pool, garden, road, musician, computer) and stories to convey key principles: the gradual nature of purification, the need for joyful repetition, the shift from fighting thoughts to nurturing wholesome states, and the importance of recognizing and playing with mental phenomena rather than being controlled by them.
