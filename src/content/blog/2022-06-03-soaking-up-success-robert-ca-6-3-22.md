### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So there we go. All right, Robert, you just said there's a part of you that wants to be unhappy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what it feels like.

**Speaker A:** All right, so tell me more about that.

**Speaker B:** So, um, Subjectively, it feels like it's almost like a second entity inside me that doesn't actually like— maybe like it doesn't enjoy like being happy and it prefers being unhappy. Like, I'm not exactly sure, but it feels a lot of the time like there's always this like another part of me that's like resisting practicing. Because I know the steps of like remembering and like feeling good that I've remembered and thinking wholesome thoughts and replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome thoughts. But there's like, even then, there's still this like wall of kind of resistance. And I feel like that ball is like a part of me that like wants me to stay unhappy. It kind of sounds a little crazy.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, um, it's not necessarily crazy, but it's incorrect in some ways. And the example of that— it's part of me, right? Is it?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's like, I don't know, it feels like an entity inside me, kind of.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** There's like my ego and there's like a second ego, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, in fact, that's the way that Freud describes it, and he calls it the superego. Now basically what's happened in English language is we've got something backwards, and I'll just take a moment to talk about that, and then we'll go into the superego. The point is that we have confused ego with id, and that gives rise to language like egotism, egotistical, and the way that we use the word ego. But both Freud and Eric Byrne use the, let us say, the concept of the adult, or the way that we would think correctly, or let us say our wisdom. That's actually the ego, and that what we call ego is actually the anterior cortex, the habits, the instincts, and our identity. We identify. Okay, so in that regard, we should be using words like idtistical. Would have been egotistical. So, um, and I just wanted to point that out because it is a way of beginning to look at things differently. Now, the reality is, is that you say that you've got two egos. So that would be the child, which is the id, is the first ego, the one that we're talking about. And then that second ego is what is referred to as from Byrne as the parent ego state, or what Freud calls the superego. And that's the part where all of those rules come in, like you're not supposed to be happy. It's a rule that you've learned. And you probably made that rule up that, oh, if I am happy, something bad will happen. In other words, an example of that would be the child goes to school with a new toy and he wants to show it off to his friends, and within minutes it's broken. And so we say, oh, well, that means that I should not bring my good favorite toys to school because they're going to get broken. Arahant. So now we can change that because that can actually happen with a child. But then the child can make even a bigger decision rather than the decision, oh, I should not be bringing my toys to school, they'll get broken. I should not bring my joy to school, it will get broken also. Now, I don't know exactly what the rules are that you've had, but that you have a set of rules in there about how things are supposed to be. You've heard me talk about this before, that the Buddha talks about it in the sense of attachments to rights, rules, and rituals, or attachments to the way that things are supposed to be. But those decisions about how things are supposed to be were done by a little kid who was quite ignorant, didn't know what he was doing. And that kid still needs taken care of and still needs nurturing, but all you're giving him is more criticism. You're giving him more rules to follow rather than learning to nurture yourself, to become friends with yourself, that you don't have to be unhappy in order to be safe. That you can be happy and safe together. That in fact, that's part of the practice of Anapanasati, is to actually practice. But we have to remember to practice, to remember to look at the feelings and the thoughts that we have and throw those out and bring something in. Well, right now I'm okay. Right now I'm all right. Everything is okay right now. Let me hear you say that.

**Speaker B:** Right now I'm okay. Right now.

**Speaker A:** Right now I'm okay. Right now I'm all right. You need to say that over and over and over again until that's what gets stuck. That becomes the new habit.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** You're all right now. Everything is okay right now. Not a problem in the world right now. No dangers right now.

**Speaker B:** It's weird because it's like weirdly difficult to believe. It's like I'll say it and I'll say it and Somehow, like, I just kind of believe it, but I kind of don't. It's like it doesn't sink in all the way, but it's— I don't know, I just— it's weirdly difficult to believe.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what's standing in the way then? What's keeping it from sinking in? I think that possibly what it is is that you have that resistance, and so you stop doing it. Perhaps what we need to do is to go ahead and let it sink in. This is also true in many other cases, that a wet cloth, a washing cloth, or a modern sponge, if those things get dried out, you can put it under a faucet, or you can put that sponge in water by just dropping it on the water. It will float on top. And the water won't go in. Now, the natural tendency then immediately is, oh, this sponge is no good because it will not absorb the water. It's all dried out. It's probably old. Now let me throw it out. Right. But if you keep dropping water on that sponge over and over again, it will start to take the water. So this is where we need to practice. You need to keep watering, keep watering, keep watering, keep watering, even if it doesn't soak in yet. In fact, you're probably not aware that it's already been soaking in. You've already made some marvelous changes. But you don't want to give yourself credit for it. And that's because of this attitude of being a loser, to where in fact you're not a loser, you're a winner. All we have to do is change our attitude about it, but we have to change that attitude over and over and over. And over again. Keep dropping the water on that sponge and it will someday start to soak in. If you trust that— right now you don't trust that you can keep doing it. You have the attitude, what's the use? Why don't I just give up? Oh, poor me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that about sums it up. There's like, there's some joy in that, but it's, yeah, yeah, it's like Yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. Well, now you're with that smile, you're putting another drop of water on it. Begin to trust that you can change, that you've got a set of rules inside. We all carry those rules, and you built those rules up without a deep, close inspection. And so you made a rule without inspecting it very well. That's actually funny, as a side note, that in Congress or in a legislative body, generally what happens is that if a new law is really, really deeply investigated, thoroughly investigated, talked about, and all kinds of stuff, it doesn't get passed. But if a stupid idea comes up, like the new name for an airport or the new name for a post office, or, you know, honoring someone or whatever like that, then those laws get passed lickety-split because they don't mean anything. Okay, so this is what we need to look at then, is we're going to change that style, that we're not going to operate the way that they do, that we could say in fact that child will just licky to split, taking any new rule in. But as an adult, we stop changing our rules, we're stuck with the old rules. And what is time now is for you to start investigating these rules. And one of the rules that you're made is, is that you're better off being unhappy, right? That's how it feels. But think about that logically. Is that true? Is it really true?

**Speaker B:** No, not at all.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not. It's not true at all. That's the investigation we need to do, to investigate that all you can change. You've been changing. Look that you can change, and that you don't have to get punished for making a change. Okay, then in fact, this is quite instinctual, but going along to get along, this is most This is the most common woful state for Westerners. OK, that in other cultures it will be other things that are the primary woful state. Some cultures are perpetually angry. Other cultures are perpetually in a state of greed. Maybe not so much cultures, but certain individuals in it. But they just never get what they want. They're always wanting more. They're always wanting more. And then there are those of us who, uh, let us say, are the victims for the ones who were super greedy, and we're the ones who have to do their work for them. To go along to get along. Okay. We can actually say that there are four primary ways of looking at things. This is the OK Corral. The OK Corral is I'm okay, you're okay. I'm okay, but you're not okay. You're okay, but I'm not okay. And then there is I'm not okay and you're not okay. Now, Eric Berne came up with this stuff, oh, 60, 70 years ago, and it's called the OK Corral. You can see it in quadrants in the sense of I'm okay, you're okay. And that's the way that we want to work with, with wisdom. I'm okay, you're okay can also be thought of as a win-win. You can also see then that if we have the idea that I'm okay and you're not okay, what that means is that I will take benefit for myself even if other people lose. This also can be considered the thief. Or the criminal. The criminally minded is, is that I don't care what happens to you, at least I'm going to get my share. Okay. And, and, uh, then, uh, the next group is what you would call helpless or hapless. And that is, is that they will set up the situation so that someone else will benefit even when they don't. And that's kind of the situation that you've gotten yourself into, that you're a hapless, helpless, helpful person. You're helpless because you can't get help, but you're helpful because you will help other people, right? The generosity. And then the last group Recently I've seen a talk and the whole talk was on stupid people. Now, stupid people are the ones who do not gain the benefit, but they set it up absentmindedly or stupidly so that the other people don't get a benefit. This is the lose-lose situation. Now, the point that this particular psychologist was making was that stupid people is not a matter of education. It's a matter of attitude. That stupid people are in all professions. You can have a stupid heart surgeon and you can have a productive heart surgeon or one who is actually a winner in his life. He helps other people. But a stupid heart surgeon, he may be able to do heart surgery, but he doesn't get along with his staff or whatever like that. So it winds up being a lose-lose situation. You could go so far as to say that in this stratosphere, on the top, you will have I'm okay, you're okay, and I'm okay, or you're okay, but I'm not okay. That's the hapless. So you have the winners and the hapless and the helpless on the top, and then you have the criminals and the stupid on the bottom. Okay. All right. Because they're the ones who— the criminal doesn't help other people, but he'll try to get it for himself. To where stupid people will try to harm them, will not try to. They're absent-mindedly doing this. They don't even know what they're doing, but they wind up not getting any benefit and also harming other people, too. You could actually go so far now as to say that the Democratic Party in the United States is a combination of helpless helpful people and the winners, and that the Republican Party is left with the criminals who are the politicians and the greedy wealthy people. And then the stupid people is their voters, the rednecks, the ones who are so afraid that they don't want anything to happen. They're the ones who buy the guns, by the way, is the stupid people. So you could actually measure stupidity. How many guns do you own? If you've got a whole house full of guns, that makes you a very, very, very stupid person. Why? Because what are guns for? They're for hurting people. And the people who get hurt most with guns are the ones who own them. The houses that have guns have more violence than the houses that don't have them. It's a mental attitude. Guess what? It's not actually the gun that pulls the trigger.

**Speaker B:** It's the person.

**Speaker A:** It's the guy who is acting stupidly. Now, this is an important point for us in the sense of you identifying with the fact that you would rather other people get a benefit rather than allowing yourself to have a benefit, where the wise way of doing it is setting it up for a win-win so that you and your friend wind up both gaining benefit. But you won't let yourself have your benefit. Because if you take your benefit, it might be dangerous. It might be taken away from you. Okay, but how we're going— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I relate to that. Um, kind of like, I get like a feeling a lot where, um, if I, if I become happy, I'll lose it and I'll become unhappy again. So I don't want to like find joy in things. Like, I don't like, um, like some things like material desires kind of things. Like, I, I have like a thought like, if I pursue this, this will like lead to unhappiness down the road. So I don't want to— I don't actually like pursue it, even though I guess pursuing it would make me happy while I'm doing it. Because I think it will end in suffering.

**Speaker A:** Right, so you'll get punished then if you're happy. You'll lose it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what we need now to do with our practice of Anapanasati is to prove that's not true. You have to prove to yourself that that's not true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** How are we going to do that? Well, we have, number one, to remember to practice. Number two is to remember that you can practice and that you can change the thoughts that you're having and have happy thoughts. Now, if you don't, that you just go around miserable anyway, then you're just still miserable. If you do have happy thoughts and then the misery comes back, didn't mean that the misery came back because you were happy. It's that the misery came back because you didn't continue to be happy. But your happiness does not cause the misery. The misery is already there.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Yeah, that's.

**Speaker A:** So. This is why the Buddha talks about that everything is founded in ignorance. Ignorance is the start. You ignorantly made a decision when you were a child that if you're happy, you'll have to suffer for it. So now as an adult, you have to prove to yourself that you can be happy and you're not going to get slapped or slugged for that. You can in fact have a great big happy smile right now and nothing will happen other than you've got a big happy smile. That's all there is to it. The question is, how long can you maintain the smile? Because the misery is going to come back. It's an old habit.

**Speaker B:** When I start smiling, I immediately have the thought that when I stop smiling, it'll hurt more because I was and I lost it. So it'll hurt extra, whereas if I just stay kind of mildly miserable, it won't hurt as much.

**Speaker A:** Well, mildly miserable is a whole lot better than totally miserable now, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we're going in the right direction.

**Speaker B:** I feel like when I get totally miserable, I kind of give up on everything, and there's like so much self-pity that like the, like the good side of the self-pity kind of outweighs the stuff that I'm self-pitying myself for, if you know what I mean. And it actually feels good again. That's like kind of what I was talking about in the Sangha, um, the last Sangha call we did, where like if I become like really, really miserable, then I kind of like don't care about anything and it goes good again. But that's obviously like not the direction I want to go in because then that's just like training myself to become miserable and more self-pitying and stuff. And that's bad.

**Speaker A:** And there's also the attitude that that's who you are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I noticed this today. I noticed this today. I was noticing how, like, because I was kind of like in this middle, like, ground of— I wasn't like fully unhappy and I wasn't like fully happy either. I was in this like awkward middle ground where everything was like as uncomfortable as it gets. And I was noticing how, like, when I become like completely unhappy and kind of give up on myself, there is like a feeling of wholeness there. Like, I'm like whole as a person. I'm not like an unhappy person trying to become happy. I'm not in this like awkward like middle space. I'm like, I'm kind of like whole. I kind of know who I am. It's like, oh yeah, I'm a depressed person who failed at life and who's completely miserable. But there's like a, there's like a feeling of like wholeness and unification in that. I was really—.

**Speaker A:** Today, except that you're not a miserable person, that that's what our society teaches us, that once our rules and methods and feeling patterns are set up in childhood, as an adult we are doomed to repeat that same system over and over and over again. This is also what is normally referred to as providence or destiny. You're destined to be miserable. Right. The reality though is, is no, it's just a habit. It's just a habit. That's all it is. And here we are already beginning to modify and begin to change that habit so that you're not totally miserable now all the time. You're only just a little bit miserable most of the time, with moments of joy sprinkled in when you remember So all we have to do now is just remember some more joy. Remember to gladden up, to remember to brighten the mind over and over and over again. Let's have a new habit. Now the interesting thing is, is that really, really old, old, old stuff that we keep repeating over and over and over again gets pretty solid. But the interesting thing is, is that old, old, old stuff will get really, really old and sink to the bottom if we start adding a whole lot of new wholesome stuff on top. Your more recent memories are more useful for you than your old, old, old memories. Except that if your new memories are already reinforced by the old memories, then it's just the same thing piling on, piling on. But you have a choice of what kind of memories, what kind of thoughts, what kind of attitudes you're going to have in this present moment, which now becomes yesterday's new memories.

**Speaker B:** That's a good point. Yeah, I guess it's like I have to like learn not to use like unhappiness as my coping mechanism, and I have to like use happiness instead, which is really difficult because I have like a lifetime of using the other one.

**Speaker A:** That's just an old habit. You have a lifetime of using that old method and you've got it ingrained as not only a rule but as a habit pattern. So you've got to change both the rule that set that habit pattern up and the habit pattern itself. And so the new rule is, Robert, it's okay for you to be happy. And you can be happy without repercussions. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, misery has more repercussions than happiness. Happiness doesn't have many repercussions. You've been getting all of these repercussions thinking that it was the happiness that was doing it. In fact, no, misery is what causes the repercussions, not the happiness. So we need to practice this. This is part of the reason of getting into seclusion, of just sitting down on our own and say, wow, I could be happy right now without any repercussions, without any problems. I can sit here and just enjoy the breathing, enjoy the moment, and be happy, and nothing bad is going to happen because of that. And by adding the breathing to this, that helps energize the body. That in fact, it's kind of important to recognize that the frontal cortex, the human part of the brain, takes more energy, takes more fuel than the reptilian and the mammalian cortex to the brains. Okay, it actually is work to be wise. It takes effort. The habits are easy. You just follow, you know, you just fall down the same stairs that you've been falling down. It's easy to fall down the stairs. It's, it's not so easy to climb the stairs, okay? But you've been falling down the stairs back into the gutter over and over and over again, and, and gotten to kind of the idea that you belong there. But you belong nowhere other than what you call home. And that's your choice, to either feel like that you're falling down a flight of stairs out of control, or you can feel like, hey, I can handle this, I'm at home now, everything is okay. And so we have to keep remembering to change those thoughts over and over and over again, to start having some new wholesome thoughts. It's okay to be happy, and no problems will occur. You can actually start talking yourself into feeling comfortable, feeling safe, that right now you are safe, right? The room that you're in is not a dangerous place, it's a safe place. So why is it that you don't feel safe in a safe place?

**Speaker B:** It's never-ending, one reason after the next.

**Speaker A:** Ah, the thoughts are not safe, but the place you're in is safe. So we need to start having the thoughts of, yes, this porch is safe, yes, this room is safe, yes, I am safe now. There is no problems. No one's coming after me right now. No disaster is about to occur. I'm safe. And that's part of what you need to keep telling yourself, is that you're safe, you're secure. Only when you feel safe can you let yourself feel comfortable. I feel safe. Is it just nice to feel safe? Finally, I felt in danger my whole life, but right now I can feel safe.

**Speaker B:** It's certainly much— it's a much different, like, direction to go in. Certainly very different. I feel really stupid though, like as soon as I start to feel a bit safe, I feel like, man, stupid, like continuing that pattern of like negative thinking and negative self-judgment.

**Speaker A:** Well, somebody told you it was stupid to be safe and happy at one time. I don't know who it was that gave you those marching orders, but that's just a rule. And the reality is not that rule. And so paying attention to what's real rather than following your old rules. And recognize that you are safe right now, and you can be safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied and happy, and the boogeyman's not going to come after you for it.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of crazy. It's.

**Speaker A:** You know, it's human. I would say that probably 25 to 30% of all of the people that you will ever meet are stuck in this same place that you're in right now, this hapless, helpless. You're capable of helping other people, you just can't help yourself. That's all right, I'm here for you. I'm a winner, so I'll help you become a winner. Just remember that you can win, that you're all right.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah. Thank you, thank you. That's— I really appreciate the helping hand.

**Speaker A:** That you actually have my permission to be okay. Nobody's ever given you permission to be okay before. They've given you permission to do what you're told to do, and then you'll be okay. And one of the things you're supposed to do is to be miserable. And so we can change those rules. Give yourself permission. You have my permission. It's okay for you to feel okay. It's okay for you to be happy and secure and content and satisfied, safe, and secure. And you have the power to do that. You have the power to change your thought from an unwholesome, miserable thought into a happy, healthy, secure, safe Satisfied. Wow, everything's okay right now. Not a problem in the world. Everything is okay. The reality, Robert, is all the real troubles are outside of the room you're in.

**Speaker B:** Is that right?

**Speaker A:** All of the real problems are outside of the room you're in. In the room that you're in, you're safe. There are no problems. In that room. All of those wall decorations are just pieces of paper. They're not dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Holy shit. Oh my God, I feel just so stupid. Like, I'm literally perfectly fine, like, in this room. I'm just like freaking out over my own thoughts. It's crazy. It's crazy, Dhammarato. It's crazy. Um, I forgot what I was going to say, but, um, but don't you.

**Speaker A:** Feel a sense of relief right now?

**Speaker B:** Definitely, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, so go with that sense of relief. Wow, I can feel relieved right now. Oh, what a relief it is just to let go of all of those problems that are outside the room. Everything's all right. Everything is fine. Not a worry in the world. And you can handle that. You're okay, Robert. You can remember over and over again. You can remember. You're okay.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** You too can get the benefit from the Dhamma. You too can win. You have permission to be a winner. To be successful, to be happy, to be secure and comfortable and satisfied. Actually, we've been talking about something already, and I should mention it to you. In TA, it's referred to as the 3 Ps: Protection, Permission, and Potency. And we've been talking about all three of those, because you don't feel protected when you feel happy and safe, that something miserable, something terrible will happen. So you need protection from that. Recognize that you can protect yourself, that you can be happy, and any misery that comes is just old misery. It's not newly created misery because you were happy, that you can be happy and be protected. And you have the power to do this. You're capable of doing it. You already know that you can do it because you have been practicing doing it. You've already been doing it, so you know that you can do it. So all you need now is just permission to give yourself permission. You've got my permission. Give yourself permission. It's okay for you to be happy and self-secure, safe, comfortable, satisfied. It's okay. You have permission. Can you give yourself permission?

**Speaker B:** I feel like to an extent, to an extent I can.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a start. Congratulations. Okay.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I have like goals in my mind, like how much I'm willing to go.

**Speaker A:** Well, one step at a time. Yeah, you've heard the old saw that a journey of a thousand miles starts with but a single step. Have you ever heard that? A journey of a thousand miles starts with but a single step. Guess what? After you've made that first step, the rest of the journey starts with just another single step.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Just one more deep breath. Just one more letting go of— it's okay to be happy. It's okay. Let me remember that it's okay. Give yourself permission. It's okay for you to be happy.

**Speaker B:** It feels better, but somehow it also feels worse. Like, somehow it feels like— Ah, but.

**Speaker A:** When it does feel worse, you can say, Arahant, I see that feeling worse. Arahant, I caught you. That's what you need to investigate. Rather than giving into it makes it feel worse, recognize that you do have that that resistance to it. And see that resistance. Play with that as a toy. I see that resistance because that's the old habit. So let's do it again. Let's say, okay, let's take a deep breath. And throw all of that stuff out. And in this moment, we're safe and secure. Everything is okay, comfortable, nice pleasant smile. Everything is okay. Now does that resistance come up again?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it does, right? I've been waiting for you to say yeah, because I can see it written all over your face.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I can't tell, like, I can't tell if I'm doing it or if it's like, like, I don't know, it's kind of confusing because it feels a little bit like I'm doing it, but also like it's an obstacle that I have to overcome. That's like in my way and I'm trying to do something else. So it's kind of a bit confusing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a pile of garbage, but you are not that pile of garbage. It's just an old Samsara. It's your habits. It's all of that accumulated stuff. And you have permission to start ignoring that stuff, including the resistance. You could just ignore all of that stuff and say, I can be happy anyway, right now. I don't have to do it the way that I've done it in the past. Right now I can be happy and safe and secure, comfortable. So do it again. Let's see a great big smile. Get yourself back into that state. Come on. Feeling safe, secure. The room that you're in got no dangers. So we have to keep practicing that over and over again, because otherwise you're going to practice, oh well, here's that resistance again, I gotta do that, I gotta go do it the old way. No, you can, you can take the right effort to do it a new way. You can do it a new way. You just have to remember to take the effort to do it a new way.

**Speaker B:** It's exhausting. Like, I'll have a moment where I'll feel like something really, like, original and new. Like, this, this feels really good. And then I'll kind of lose it and go back, like, one step forward. It's like 2 steps back or whatever.

**Speaker A:** And I'll go ahead and have the 2 steps back. That's okay, because that didn't destroy the 1 step forward that you did make. So let's make another step forward. And even if you slide back 3 stages, let's take another step forward, right? Just 1 step at a time. Never mind about what happens after we forget to take the next step. Just remember that you can make the next step.

**Speaker B:** That's it. That's it. I just got to focus on the present moment. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, right? That's what matters. It's not anything else. It's just—.

**Speaker A:** Everything's okay right now.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Everything is fine right now. You have permission. Everything is okay right now. Everything— the misery will come back, but that's not a problem, because when it does come back and I remember, I can put myself back into a state of everything's okay right now.

**Speaker B:** Everything's okay right now.

**Speaker A:** Everything's all right right now. Everything's all right. Everything's fine. This will come back later, but right now I feel good. Everything is okay. Everything is fine. Oh, what a relief it is. Everything's okay, everything is fine. Just keep telling yourself, just keep reminding yourself, just keep remembering you're okay, you're all right. That you're the boss here. You're the boss. You're all right. You're the boss here. Everything's all right. You can handle this. You take this next breath and say, oh, I feel so safe and secure. I'm still alive. Are you? Are you still alive? Did you make it this far? Robert, are you still alive? Okay. All right, go ahead. Well, congratulations, you're still alive. All of that misery didn't kill you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, somehow I'm still walking, right?

**Speaker A:** Somehow you're still here. Isn't that marvelous?

**Speaker B:** That's a miracle. That's crazy.

**Speaker A:** That's right, the miracle of life. It is an absolute miracle being alive. So keep remembering that. Keep remembering how marvelous it is to be alive, that misery ain't much life to it. But you can be alive, vibrantly alive, healthy, wholesome, taking deep breaths and becoming vibrantly alive, safe, secure. Comfortable. These are the words to keep telling yourself over and over again, and pretty soon those will be the kind of language that you use regularly rather than the misery words that you use regularly. But you got to train, train the mind over and over and over again. Everything's okay. Everything is fine, no worries, no problems. I can handle this. Everything is safe and secure and comfortable. You can do it. You can handle this. This is an easy piece of cake. You're in your room all alone. You're okay. There's no dangers, no troubles, no harm, no worries. And this is the practice. We have to remember to keep talking like this. This is the brightening of the mind, the gladdening of the mind. You can gladden up, you can brighten up, and pretty soon you'll begin to feel good. In fact, I've seen you move in and out of feeling really good in this time that we've had together today. Then you go back into being miserable again. Now you can come back. See, you can change it that quick. Look how quick you can change.

**Speaker B:** It's crazy. It's just confusing. Like, yeah, it just happens, you know. I just walk right into it. I just got to come back and.

**Speaker A:** Just Well, this is why we're going to practice.

**Speaker B:** And like my immediate reaction is like, it's like I have like, I don't know if you're familiar with like dissociation at all, but it's like I have like walls of like dissociatedness. So I'm like, I'm not like looking at what's here, you know, like I'm kind of like, kind of— I mean, I don't really know what dissociation is, but it's like I'm kind of like, I'm kind of like dissociated a little bit. So I'm kind of like, like not, like not really, like, I don't know, it's like a, it's like a resistance that's like becoming like not a resistance. It's kind of like what it is. So it's like I'm resisting, but I'm resisting for the purpose of like feeling like I can handle it. Like, because if I don't resist, I'll be overwhelmed. So it's like, I'll kind of like move through these, like through the call today, it's kind of like I've been like moving through these like walls of like less, more or less like kind of dissociatedness. Like sometimes when I do it, I feel a bit like overwhelmed with emotions. And so I'll resist again, but it'll actually make me feel better, which is weird.

**Speaker A:** So it's kind of— but anytime that you get overwhelmed, you get over it. But the first time that you were overwhelmed, you didn't continue that up until this day. I mean, you've been overwhelmed and then got over it and gotten overwhelmed and gotten over it. Sometimes we feel overwhelmed, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we feel like a nut, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we feel miserable, but that's gotten to be a right, uh, royal habit for you. But you can in fact come out of that. I've watched you come out of it a dozen times in this hour. I can cheer you up. Can you cheer yourself up? Can you remember to cheer yourself up?

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Do you give yourself permission to cheer up? Do you give yourself permission to feel good? To feel safe and secure and comfortable. You deserve it. Why don't you give yourself permission to do it? Mhm. You're alive, and that was the only qualification for feeling good. I like that. That sounds beautiful, doesn't You're alive, and that's the only qualification you need to feel good.

**Speaker B:** That's really good. That's quotable. I liked it.

**Speaker A:** So give yourself permission. You, you're qualified. You're alive.

**Speaker B:** I'm qualified. I'm alive. That's the only Qualification. I need to feel good. It's all I need. All the permission I need.

**Speaker A:** It's all the permission you need that you're alive and you qualify. You deserve it. And you do not deserve the misery that you've been giving yourself all of these years. But you gave yourself all that misery because you thought you deserved it. Somewhere down in there, somebody told you that you were a real screw-up.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** And you believed them, and you still believe them right up in— even right now, you still believe them. But you're still alive. How bad you screwed up, it didn't kill you. You're still alive, which means you have permission, you have the qualification to feel good even if you've screwed up. We've all screwed up. Guess what? Everybody's a screw-up. It's.

**Speaker B:** True, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, everybody's a screw-up and some are happy and some of them are not. Why do you make yourself miserable because you're screwed up when everybody's a screw-up?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a double standard actually. Yeah, everyone's screwed up.

**Speaker A:** Everybody is screwed up, but that doesn't make them miserable. You make yourself miserable.

**Speaker B:** That's— yeah, I'm starting to see that. Yeah, that's.

**Speaker A:** Good. Keep looking, keep recognizing that you do have permission, you do have the qualifications to feel good, to feel satisfied and comfortable. Safe, secure, satisfied. It's okay. You have my permission. You have the permission of life itself. Now what better endorsement do you need than that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's crazy. Life is just crazy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, take another deep breath and feel alive. Allow yourself to take those deep breaths. They're good, they're wholesome, they're healthy, and they can give you the exact energy you need in order to think clearly. Wow, being alive is a really nice thing. So just relish being alive right now. Isn't it nice? Isn't it marvelous that you can receive sensory input and process it and breathe? It's just so marvelous to be alive. Even if you're a screw-up, you're still okay. You're still alive. Celebrate it. Celebrate that you're alive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you did it. Here we are. That's crazy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so these are the kind of thoughts that you should be having for yourself. Gladden the mind. Celebrate that you're still alive. No matter how miserable you've been in the past, you're still alive. Celebrate that you're still alive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Man.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. It's really, really helpful. I'm really glad I called you tonight. It really helped.

**Speaker A:** Great. Excellent. All right, well, let's finish now. We've got it on a good note. Go celebrate.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Thank you. This is actually like— yeah, it's really— I feel really good but really stupid at the same time.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's all right. You can be stupid. Just recognize that this kind of stupidity is stupidity from the past, not right now. Right now you're exhibiting grand wisdom. I feel you're a winner for it.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Like, I feel like a winner in this moment, in this moment now. Like, for all the, like, shit that's happened and that will happen, I feel like This is— at least we have like a winning moment now. We've got like our bubble, like our winning bubble moment thing.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Yeah, thanks. All right, Robert, we'll see you soon. Keep remembering you're okay. Keep remembering that you've got— you're still alive. Celebrate, you're still alive.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you. Can I, um, can I call again and 3 days.

**Speaker A:** Sure, absolutely. Yes, you should call more often.

**Speaker B:** I will, I will.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** I'll see you soon.

**Speaker A:** I really like your smile. You got a great smile when you let it out.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you. You too.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay, well, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** All right, ciao.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a practitioner named Robert (Speaker B), focuses on overcoming a deep-seated internal resistance to happiness and cultivating self-permission to feel safe and content.

**Core Problem:** Robert describes a feeling of a "second entity" inside him that prefers unhappiness and resists practice. He has a subconscious belief that if he becomes happy, he will inevitably lose it and suffer more, so it feels safer to remain in a state of mild, familiar misery.

**Key Teachings & Framework:**

1.  **The "Two Egos" and Internal Rules:** Dhammarato reframes this not as craziness, but as an internal conflict. He uses psychological models (Freud's superego, Berne's "Parent ego state") to explain this as a set of rigid, unconscious **rules** created in childhood (e.g., "If I'm happy, something bad will happen" or "I don't deserve happiness"). These rules are operated by a critical inner voice.

2.  **The "OK Corral":** Dhammarato introduces Eric Berne's model of life positions:
    *   **I'm OK, You're OK (Win-Win):** The wholesome, wise goal.
    *   **I'm OK, You're Not OK (Criminal/Exploiter):** Taking at others' expense.
    *   **I'm Not OK, You're OK (Helpless/Helpf ul):** Robert's identified position—helping others but not allowing himself to benefit, stemming from a fear of punishment for happiness.
    *   **I'm Not OK, You're Not OK (Stupid/Lose-Lose):** Harmful to self and others.

3.  **The Practice - "Dropping Water on a Dry Sponge":** The solution is consistent, patient mental training:
    *   **Investigate the Rule:** Logically challenge the old belief ("Is it *true* that being happy causes suffering?").
    *   **Install a New Rule:** Consciously adopt a new permission: "It is okay for me to be happy and safe."
    *   **Use Anchoring Phrases:** Repeatedly use present-moment affirmations like: **"Right now, I'm okay. Right now, I'm safe. Everything is okay right now."**
    *   **Persist Despite Resistance:** Like watering a dried-out sponge, you must keep applying the wholesome thought even when it doesn't seem to "sink in." The old habit of misery will return, but you can meet it and choose again.

4.  **The 3 Ps (from Transactional Analysis):**
    *   **Permission:** Give yourself explicit permission to be happy, safe, and secure. Dhammarato grants this permission, urging Robert to internalize it.
    *   **Protection:** Understand that happiness itself is not dangerous; the ensuing misery is just an old habit returning, not a punishment *caused by* the happiness.
    *   **Potency/Power:** Recognize you already have the ability and have demonstrated it by shifting your state during the talk. You have the power to change your thoughts.

5.  **The Ultimate Qualification for Happiness:** A central, liberating insight offered is: **"You're alive, and that's the only qualification you need to feel good."** Your existence itself is the permission slip. Celebrate the miracle of being alive, regardless of past mistakes.

**Summary:** The talk guides Robert from seeing himself as doomed to misery by a mysterious internal entity, to understanding it as a set of changeable childhood rules and habits. The path out is through relentless, gentle self-training: investigating false beliefs, consciously granting oneself permission to be happy, and using present-moment phrases to anchor the mind in safety and okay-ness, thereby building a new, wholesome habit over the old one. The session ends with Robert experiencing a tangible shift, feeling like a "winner" in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

This talk is rich with metaphors and stories to illustrate psychological and spiritual concepts. Here are the primary ones used:

### **1. The Sponge Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The mind is compared to a dried-out sponge that is placed on water. At first, it floats and resists absorbing the water.
*   **Purpose:** To explain the nature of practice and resistance. Just as you must keep dripping water on the sponge until it finally soaks in, you must keep repeating positive affirmations and practices ("Right now I'm okay") even when they feel like they aren't "sinking in." The change is gradual and requires persistent "watering."

### **2. The Internal Rule-Making Story (The Broken Toy)**
*   **What it is:** A story about a child who brings a new toy to school, it gets broken, and the child makes a rule: "Don't bring good toys to school."
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how the "superego" or "parent ego state" forms irrational, childhood-based rules. The speaker extends it to show how such rules can generalize: from "don't bring your toy" to "don't bring your *joy*," because it too might get "broken." This explains Robert's core belief that happiness is dangerous and will lead to punishment or loss.

### **3. The Legislative Body / Congress Analogy**
*   **What it is:** The mind's rule-making process is compared to a legislature.
*   **Purpose:** To show how our deepest, most damaging rules (like "I must be unhappy") are passed "lickety-split" without deep inspection—like naming a post office—because the child-mind doesn't scrutinize them. Conversely, changing these rules as an adult requires the careful, investigative work of a wise legislature examining a major bill.

### **4. The "OK Corral" Framework (from Eric Berne)**
*   **What it is:** A four-quadrant model of life positions:
    1.  **I'm OK, You're OK (Win-Win):** The healthy, wise position.
    2.  **I'm OK, You're Not OK (Criminal/Thief):** Taking benefit at others' expense.
    3.  **I'm Not OK, You're OK (Helpless/Helpless):** Helping others but not oneself (identified as Robert's position and common in Western culture).
    4.  **I'm Not OK, You're Not OK (Stupid/Lose-Lose):** Unconsciously creating harm for all.
*   **Purpose:** To categorize Robert's mindset ("helpless helpful") and show it as a specific, changeable attitude, not an identity. The extended political analogy (Democrats vs. Republicans) is used to make the abstract categories more concrete and memorable.

### **5. The Staircase Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Falling into old, miserable habits is like "falling down the stairs"—it's easy and requires no effort. Cultivating new, wholesome thoughts is like "climbing the stairs"—it takes conscious work and energy.
*   **Purpose:** To normalize the difficulty of practice. It frames the struggle not as a personal failing, but as the natural inertia of old neural pathways versus the required effort to build new ones.

### **6. The "Safe Room" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A direct, real-time exploration of Robert's immediate physical environment. The speaker insists that *in the room he is currently in*, there are no real dangers; the walls and decorations are just paper.
*   **Purpose:** To create a powerful, experiential distinction between **actual, present-moment safety** and the **perceived, mental danger** of his thoughts. This leads to Robert's moment of insight: "I'm literally perfectly fine, like, in this room. I'm just like freaking out over my own thoughts."

### **7. The Journey of a Thousand Miles**
*   **What it is:** A reference to the common proverb: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
*   **Purpose:** To encourage persistence and break down the overwhelming task of changing a lifetime of habit. The speaker adds a crucial follow-up: "After you've made that first step, the rest of the journey starts with just *another* single step," emphasizing continuous, moment-to-moment effort.

### **8. The "3 Ps" (Protection, Permission, Potency)**
*   **What it is:** A framework from Transactional Analysis (TA).
*   **Purpose:** To structure the solution. Robert needs to feel **Protection** (safe to be happy), give himself **Permission** (it's okay to be happy), and recognize his **Potency** (he has the power to do it). The talk revolves around granting these three things.

### **9. The "Miracle of Life" Celebration**
*   **What it is:** A recurring refrain that simply being alive is a "miracle" and the **only qualification needed** to feel good, safe, and deserving of happiness.
*   **Purpose:** To bypass all of Robert's complex, conditional rules for worthiness. It's an ultimate, non-negotiable source of permission and a tool for "gladdening the mind."

### **10. The "Pile of Garbage" vs. "The Boss" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The accumulation of old habits, miseries, and rules is dismissed as a "pile of garbage" or "old Samsara." In contrast, the true self in the present moment is "the boss."
*   **Purpose:** To externalize the problem (the "garbage" is not *you*) and empower the listener (you are in charge, you can "ignore the garbage").

These metaphors and stories work together to **demystify** Robert's painful experience (showing it as common, habitual, and based on old rules), **provide a clear map** for change (the OK Corral, the 3 Ps), and **offer tangible tools** for practice (the sponge, the safe room, the single step).
