### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So start with you going, turning the laptop off.

**Speaker B:** All right, so turn the laptop off.

**Speaker A:** Hang on, hang on. Okay, now.

**Speaker B:** All right, so I turned the laptop off. I was exhausted. I was tired. Um, I, I felt like, at least I had thoughts like there were tears coming on. Um, but I, I, you know, I went into my girlfriend's arms and I just laid there with her. And it's actually really cool, Dharma. It was a tender moment. I told her like At first she didn't want to cuddle, actually. She didn't feel up to it. But I just looked at her in the eyes and I just told her, I was like, you know, I don't know what came over me, but I was coming back from the chat and I just felt like I wanted to hug my mommy. And she's like, oh, and she like grabbed me and held me close. And I just was able to let out some tears. And it felt It's cool because I noticed that I had more unwholesome thoughts at one point. And I noticed that was bringing more tears out. But it wasn't like a problem. Whereas I think if I cried in the past, it would be like, you know, unwholesome thought that I would not be conscious of. And I would think that there's some, you know, force governing me that's making me cry. But what I could see, I think, is that I I have a part, a strong part in that too, especially in the continuation of crying. And I was able to enjoy it. I was like, oh, I like this. This is nice. This is nice to just cry like this. This is okay. This feels good. I was like, wow, that's really cool. And yeah, I just chilled out. And, you know, I feel like I've been— the axing away at the thoughts has been kind of like a— like this action figure is like in my head, like, and I think I started to come down from that. And instead, just let it be like a flash, but like more gentle, like a gentle kind of attitude, even though the axing is more of a gentle attitude rather than like, I'm gonna get you. And then I just follow that up immediately with a congratulations and a smile. And then today, I got up and anytime I axe something now, pretty reliably, I don't like— there's nothing to axe at. Like, I see the unwholesome thought. But like, when I axe at it, it feels like empty. I guess that would be a good way to say it. It feels completely empty. But just for protection, I have been doing it anyway. And I noticed, that's okay. It's interesting. It doesn't seem like a chore. There's sometimes things that come up like, I don't want to do this right now. And I'm like, I see you too. It's all right. But now I got this really cool idea.

**Speaker A:** Wait, before you go into the new idea, hang on to that. Let's go back.

**Speaker B:** All right, let's go back.

**Speaker A:** A postmortem of the moment that you're in the arms of your mommy, and even earlier back to when you mentioned that about mommy. She was enormously receptive to that, as opposed to, I'm not your mommy, I'm your girlfriend.

**Speaker B:** Which I told her about our chat. I told her about our chat, actually, that it's like healthy to talk like that with each other if we can nurture each other in that way and also know what we're doing. And she likes it. We like it very much.

**Speaker A:** Right. It touches a nerve with women in a way that Papa doesn't touch with men. Yeah. Okay. Mama. Yeah. And so talking about the tears now for a moment. Okay. I'll use an expression that's kind of weird. And it doesn't fit into most people's understanding. And that is the term. And it's not an oxymoron, it's a descriptive term. The tears of an Arahant. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** I've heard that.

**Speaker A:** Because you would think that an Arahant would be beyond all tears.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Because that's a warrior. An Arahant is supposed to be like at the end of the path, have completed the path. That's what an Arahant is. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, except that you're now talking about the joy of the relief. That this is the word that I would use. In fact, I would ask you the question is, is that while those tears are coming out, it's a sense of relief, a sense of, oh wow. Oh, this is— yeah, okay. That relief is the quality that they're talking about in the suttas when they're talking about letting go. But the Western mind has the quality of prying our hands loose from it rather than the reality of after we've let go, our hand begins to feel better. And if we let go of something in the mind, the mind begins to feel better. It's not grabbing and holding and clinging on to something. Now it can relax. And you had a really nice moment of deep relaxation. Good for you. Yeah. Okay. In this regard, tears are good. This is also why some music literally does bring tears to the eye. They've known about it for so long. They do it with movies and, you know, they call it tear-jerkers and all of that kind of stuff. Okay. These are not necessarily unwholesome tears. For one thing, if they are tears of loss, is it tears of someone else's loss? Or let us say displaced in from my pity party into the reality that I live in a complete world of a pity party. Okay. And this is also— we have words like pathos. And there is great beauty in pathos. Okay, uh, uh, plays— there are many of them that are tragedies, but the ones who really make an impact are the ones who are also a farce, where the tragedy is ridiculous.

**Speaker B:** That's very true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know if you're familiar with Chekhov. I used to do a lot of Chekhov in acting school. And Chekhov is very much like that. There's a lot of humor, but they're all tragedies.

**Speaker A:** There's also the beauty in that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the beauty in that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a lot of beauty in it. And one of the ones that I would mention would be a particular symphony by a particular composer. His name was Tchaikovsky. You've heard of him. And it's his Sixth Symphony that he wrote when he was in the depths of depression. But at that time of the writing of it, he was not committing suicide. That happened later, actually, after yet another piece of work that was done or unfinished. He's got an unfinished Seventh Symphony. But this Sixth Symphony that he did is absolutely profoundly sad to the point that it brings tears to the eyes. But these are not harsh tears, they're sweet. It's so beautiful that it really touches the soul and that we need to experience the soul, right? Goes down to the depths so that we can actually shine a light on the tragedy of human existence, is that it's not a farce the way that it ought to be. And that the whole society is about that. There is actually a videotape on YouTube by— his name is Achan Mahaboa from Udontani. He died in 1912. This was done a few years before he died. And the topic that he's talking about is, does an Arahant cry? Which is exactly the point that we're making here. This is the whole thing about it. And that in there, he uses language that the Western ear winces on because it's low, harsh language, but it's actually the literal translation out of the Thai. The word in Thai language is khee, and they have khee buri. Buri is a cigarette. What is khee buri? Ash. That's how the word is used all over the place. Okay. There is also a chili that is a very tiny one. It's about the size of a rat turd. And guess what its name in Thailand is? Kinu Prick. The prick, the chili of the key of a mouse. So this is the word that Ajahn Mahaboa is saying when he says that the whole society of humanity is is nothing but a giant toilet full of shit.

**Speaker B:** For sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And there's a beautiful sadness in that. And part of the sadness is that each one of the turds think that they're the only turd in the bowl without recognizing, no, this— the turd— you can't tell who did what turd. You know, but that there is a sad, profound sadness to it, and the cry is not a cry of desperation, it's a cry of relief that we can see it the way that it is. So I thought that I would add that for you, to give you a pat on the back and congratulations. Let's go have a good cry. Together. It's relaxing, it's relieving that people after a cry, they feel so much better. And part of the crying also is that they're doing some pretty good breathing during it. Yeah, it cleans out and flushes out the eyes. I mean, it's a purative process when done, uh, in the way that we're talking about. Yeah, what a relief it is.

**Speaker B:** What a relief it is.

**Speaker A:** And so if you're listening to a piece of music and it makes you cry, enjoy it. It's the beauty of being alive.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I love that. Oh, for sure, love that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So then we— you were about to embark upon The next thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I was telling you about how I've noticed with the axing of a thought that it started to occur much more empty, whereas before it was like there was this whole world of like joy and throwing the axe and then seeing it come back and, you

**Speaker A:** know, there was like— And conquering a great big target.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and now it's more like, it's more like, I'll like, okay, so this is, this is weird, because what's what I, I can't tell what exactly is happening other than this and what I, what I've been experiencing.

**Speaker A:** I have some questions for you.

**Speaker B:** You do?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** You have questions for me?

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes. Okay. Would you say that part of the distinction between a great big axe swing and hitting a great big target versus now it's much more almost empty and easy peasy is because you're catching it a little quicker now so it doesn't get so big in your own mind? Either one of them.

**Speaker B:** I think it's that. Yeah, I think it's that too. And it's that I've had so much— I was talking about this with Dan today, Dan Goldfield, talking about I think what I'm starting to see is that once you have really great content that you're replacing— so great content would be the wholesome thoughts. Not great content would be the unwholesome thoughts. And when you start replacing the unwholesome thoughts with the wholesome, you get exposed to what we call the message of that content, which is the positive feedback loop. And the exposure to that positive feedback loop over and over and over again creates evidence where you can have complete conviction that you can do this and that you can feel good. And it starts to occur much more easily and quicker that you can feel good. When encountering an unwholesome thought. It can be, whereas before it would take a whole breath to feel good, now it could take a couple seconds of doing an inhale to feel. It's like a spark, like a lightning bolt of Sati, like, oh, it feels good. And now I can even say, oh, that feels good, even if it doesn't feel as good as I'm expressing it, but it feels good to say that it feels good. So it's like—

**Speaker A:** Go ahead. I'm just seeing a message.

**Speaker B:** Do you want to read it? Do you want to read it?

**Speaker A:** I did it already.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Already done.

**Speaker B:** So it's like the wholesome is just compounding and compounding and compounding. So what I've noticed today And what I wanted to like, check on with you about is, it seems like, or what I've noticed, no, what has happened today is there has in general been less instances in which I have unwholesome thoughts. But what's interesting is I don't know if it's that I'm noticing the unwholesome thoughts less, or they're actually happening less? Because the thing is,

**Speaker A:** even if that's what I'm saying, yes, they do start to happen less often.

**Speaker B:** Less often. But the thing is, is I can't tell the difference.

**Speaker A:** They're not as strong.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but the thing is, is I can't tell the difference between if they're happening less often or they're still happening the same amount. I'm just not noticing them as much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, logic will say that if you're developing a skill, then as you're developing the skill, you're better at practicing that skill than you were before you started practicing the skill.

**Speaker B:** So it seems like it would be the former, that there really actually is less, at least in this moment, or this day.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. While we're practicing. And not only that, but now you're directing that thing that is referred to— why, it's that item on the list of the Eightfold Noble Path that is translated as right intention, that we've also talked about, has to do with right attitude and also right expectation. But the difficulty with the word intention is that that also is closely related to Tanha, or wanting, which is slightly different. But we can use the word intention here, right intention. So now your right intention is to have wholesome thoughts. Your right intention is to feel good. Yes. As a feel-good. We begin to take on that winner's attitude, or we can talk about it in the sense of the attitude of the winner is that I do have wholesome thoughts. I'm the winner here. These thoughts are wholesome. Let's inspect them once again. Let's inspect them once again. But always keep looking and keep looking, and they become more often more wholesome and less often unwholesome, and very rarely downright harmful.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Right, right. Now, what's really interesting about this though, is that the joy that I was experiencing, as I mentioned, you know, as I've been doing this practice, is much less as well. But this is— now this is where it gets really interesting, okay? I can be like watching TV or being out with my girlfriend or doing something. And I can't tell if like nothing is going on, or I'm just not paying attention. Because I'm still feeling pretty good. But I'm not having to remind myself to feel good.

**Speaker A:** And I'm not building up a habit slowly. You're changing your frame of reference. That's another way of talking about it. The Samma Sanghappa, the right intention. Now we can say you're actually changing or shifting your way of looking at things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. An example of that is, is that there is a drawing that has two vases, two vases sitting side by side, and they are kind of scrolly work. But when you set them side by side, obviously a face appears in the gap between them. You've seen this, right? Okay, now the question is, who sees which one first? And that's the way that we look at the whole world. We see the, the vase in a, uh, let us say, the way that it is. But we don't see things that are hidden. Another example is that there's a drawing that has a young woman and an old woman in the same drawing. One of them, the nose of one is the chin of the other one. Right, right. That kind of thing. Now, the point that we're making is, is that if we can shift our focus from one of them to the other and really be able to see it that other way, Now we can see it completely of what the artist has done, what a magnificent piece of art this is that this artist could put both in. And many people cannot see the hidden image in there. Okay. This is kind of the way that now we're looking at reality, that humanity and our human culture has taught us to look at the vase only and not look at the gap between the vase, which is not just a vase, two vases together. Now there's a photo world of person inside there.

**Speaker B:** Or I would even say, as the vase is all there is, the vase

**Speaker A:** is all that there is to humanity.

**Speaker B:** There's not a possibility of there being any other way.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** But in our imagination or in a fantasy, which— and that isn't even the face, the other face.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, in the 1980s there was actually a bumper sticker that I saw that was popular, and the bumper sticker actually said, life is shit and then you die. Okay, that means that they cannot see it the way that— because many people will say, well, he's— they're saying just the same thing that Ajahn Mahaboa is saying. And you're saying no, Your tears of life is shit and then you die is an unhappy one, rather than the Anicca's tears is the tears for joy. Why? I'm so relieved that I can see that there is more to this than just the vase. I can see that the world is a toilet of shit. But that's not all there is to it. So life is shit and then you die means they can't see the other side. That's exactly what happens with atheism. You see, most atheists, in fact the hardest of the hardcore atheists, were at one time hardcore Christians. That follows in line exactly with things like It's ex-smokers who will tell you to stop smoking around them. The non-smokers who never smoked, they don't care so much. But if you're an ex-smoker and proud of being able to give up cigarettes, you're going to start becoming a policeman for others smoking cigarettes. Another example is fat people don't like fat people. Why do fat people don't like— because they don't like them, the fat they have together, and they've condemned themselves for it because they've always been condemned for it. And so they go around condemning everything that's fat. That's their nature. All right, the point is though that we can't see the other side of things. And so welcome to the other world, the world of relief. Wow, I can see it the way that it is. And that, by the way, that word release that we're talking about, a feeling, is exactly what we're talking about in art also. The other side.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, um, that's excellent that we can put this together and that as time goes by the wholesome will begin to take over the unwholesome so that you spend less time in the unwholesome when you're mindful. Now, when we— if mindfulness is not there, all games are back off. The way that I would say it, in fact, is like this: in fact, with martial arts or anything else, someone can be an absolute skilled marksman But in the Old West, the old teacher would take the young fast-draw artist out and kick over rocks so that he's confronted 3 feet away with a rattlesnake about to strike him. In other words, if you forget your skills in the point of danger, then it doesn't matter what skills you've got. And the skill of Sati, the skill of waking up, is that skill. And if we don't wake up to look at what's going on, the mind's going to get flooded back with the old history.

**Speaker B:** So that's kind of like why I'm saying that I can't tell if it's that the unwholesome is just happening less or if I'm just not noticing it.

**Speaker A:** And I certainly don't— That's one of the questions to keep asking yourself. How is my investigation? In other words, now that we are investigating to the point of being able to remove the unwholesome thoughts, now we want to investigate the skills and tools we use to get there. Okay, this is actually in the Suttas, in number 111. One by one as they occur. So now let's talk about what is it that's one by one as they occur with the point view that what's in the mind already is wholesome thoughts. So the things that can be looked at now when the mind is wholesome is: how is my guarding to make sure that these are wholesome thoughts? How is my Sati to remember that I am looking for the wholesome thoughts? Do I wake up to look just often, just to see? That's what we mean by unremitting mindfulness. Unremitting Sati means that we keep practicing until it becomes a habit of just kind of waking up to check how things are. There are several examples of this. One of them out of the Visuddhimagga is the example of in ancient times and still in Thailand. You know what a lungi is or a sarong? No, it's a long piece of cloth that is used tied to the waist. Women wear them, men wear them. It's a skirt, but it's just one great big piece of cloth that's folded. Monks wear them. Okay, the lower garment.

**Speaker B:** I've got a visual.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, also called a rains cloth. It's about the size of a large towel.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Now imagine that this cloth is tied, uh, in a way so that the long part of it is a hammock. And it is a perfect hammock for an infant. That most of the infants in Thailand, that's all the baby crib they ever get, is just an old piece of cloth that was in the closet tied into a hammock. Okay, when the infant is not going to sleep, then mom has to watch it carefully. To make sure that the child is going to stay in there because it's fidgeting around. But once the child is sleeping, now Mom only needs to keep an eye on it. She can actually gaze this way, and as the swing comes back and forth in her view is all she needs. She does not have to continuously look at the child, just check up on him occasionally. Okay. That's how we want to practice our Sati, just checking up on things occasionally to make sure everything is hunky-dory. The other example then would be that in Sutta 19, when the cowherd gets the cows into the pasture where they're all safe and secure and they're feeding, he can go sit down under a tree and he doesn't have to keep the stick with him to put them back in line. He takes the stick and he goes and he sits under a tree and he just rests and watches the cows. Okay, so that's the kind of analogy that we're looking for. So long as we keep having that Sati going, everything is going to be available for you because you remember that they're available to look at, to investigate, to see what's going on. And you're still in the very early phases of this. You're making really, really fast progress. Alex, and I congratulate you for that. But there is still a process going on for sure, and that's what we need to keep track of, is that this is merely a process of progress that you're going on. And pretty soon you'll begin to see the things that you're asking questions about. You begin to see, oh yes, in fact, the mind does get more settled. If you keep petting a dog, it will keep getting settled down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's okay. So you know what it— all right, well then I think I'm already seeing it because this is what it's kind of like. Do you know how like before you ever practiced any— I don't know if you can remember back this far, but if you— before you ever practiced the

**Speaker A:** Dhamma, before— I remember quite a lot.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so like I remember, right, that before I practiced the Dharma, I didn't know that I wasn't aware of unwholesome thoughts. I didn't know.

**Speaker A:** So you didn't even ever hear or have the concept of unwholesome thoughts? It didn't occur to you? It's not in your vocabulary? No one ever mentioned it?

**Speaker B:** So like, until I had that waking up experience, I didn't know there was anything to wake up from. So now, that being said, after like spending time in like what I've woken up into, it seems like at least today it's kind of like how it was before I even practiced the Dharma. Like, I'm not aware of that there's anything that I'm not aware of because

**Speaker A:** like, what can you be aware of now? Now you feel different.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the point. Okay, so this also fits in with the Zen story of the student of Zen is in the valley and the mountain is the mountain and the trees are trees. And he climbs the mountain of his mind and he looks around and he says, you know something, mountains are not mountains at all. Trees are not trees at all. Yeah. And then he climbs back down the mountain And he looks back at the mountain and he says, oh yeah, mountains are mountains and trees are trees. But now his whole perspective is completely different from it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is also what Jesus says, to be in the world but not of the world. And the Buddha says, yes, everybody's stuck in the world, you got to get out of the world and clean that out. But when you go back into the world, don't go be backing into the world Go back into the world above the world of the world. And Jesus says, be in the world, but not of the world. Be above it.

**Speaker B:** So they're backwards. Oh, they're the same.

**Speaker A:** Okay. They're the same thing. Right. Well, the point is, is that the Buddha says, but you got to get out of the world first.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Both physically and also mentally. And then you can come back into the world but not be stuck back in that world. You can deal with people and still be happy.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's interesting, you know, because I took of the world like it's above the world. Like, I think those— I think of those as the same.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Well, it says be in the world but not of the world. So of the world is stuck in the world and not— oh, And so not of the world is being above the world. So yeah, Buddha and Jesus are spot on together on that one. In that regard, by the way, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was a big fan of Jesus but completely ignorant of Christianity. Never met a Christian.

**Speaker B:** So I mean, like a couple times throughout today, whenever I would notice an unwholesome thought, it would be something like, I don't, I don't want to throw an axe right now, or I don't want to do this.

**Speaker A:** And I was just like, just relax. You've already thrown the axe. In fact, when you say, I don't want to throw the axe, the thought of throwing the axe has already happened.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. That's right. That's right. Exactly. It's like this now. I don't really like— It doesn't have

**Speaker A:** to be a great big thing to hit a great big target because it didn't get a chance to grow into a big target, a tiny little target with a tiny little one-thought axe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I see you, Mara.

**Speaker B:** Noticing the unwholesome thought is the trigger for all of the wholesome thoughts and all of the great stuff happening. And so, so, so this is interesting, right? Because since there's been less unwholesome thoughts, I've been concerned that I will have less joy because I have less triggers to trigger that joy. Does that make sense?

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't make sense at all. You can have all the joy you want. You're now thinking that the joy is conditioned punish something that you've got to do.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, no, no, no. So at first, when we start noticing the unwholesome thoughts, right, we learn to replace those unwholesome thoughts with the feeling good, the joy, congratulations, success, right? What I'm saying is that now that I'm having less unwholesome thoughts, there's less triggers for that joy that I was creating?

**Speaker A:** No, no, I'll give you a new trigger. Wait, wait, we just need to put some new triggers in there. Okay, okay. I haven't told you about all of the triggers, okay? That in fact, you've got the important trigger. The important trigger that you've got is the trigger that seeing an unwholesome thought and taking the right effort That's the triggering of the gladdening of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** They're connected now. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, what happens when you wake up and you see that the thought is already wholesome? Can you congratulate yourself for that too?

**Speaker B:** I'm doing that too. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, there's another trigger. All right. So there's more to it than that also. And that is, is that you can reflect upon, wow, how nice it's been for oh so long now. I can't believe that this stuff lasts that long. And that statement of that long can in the beginning start in 5 minutes, the next one is an hour, and then 5 years, and then, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Wow, it's been that long since I've been angry? Wow.

**Speaker B:** Another one that I've been doing is sometimes I'll just like, I'll just like, I'll be watching TV with my girlfriend and I'll be like, Oh, I feel good. This feels good right now. Oh, congratulations, success. That's great. Good job, good job. Oh man, this feels good. You know, like, I'll just— you know

**Speaker A:** about those second triggers anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know about them. It's just you just momentarily, when talking to me, you forgot, but you know they're there, that you can in fact With Sati, you could take the good feeling that you now have and boost it again.

**Speaker B:** It's just really interesting because I came

**Speaker A:** from—

**Speaker B:** every time I would see an unwholesome thought, that would be a trigger for more joy. And then I think I've started to see like a belief that I have that I need to see the unwholesome thought in order to trigger my joy. But I think what I can see now is that the joy is just here, and I can trust that it's here and enjoy and relish it being here and celebrate that. And that's it.

**Speaker A:** And the relief comes is I don't have to work at getting it anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, oh, I don't have to work at getting it anymore. It's right here.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And that's freaking nuts because—

**Speaker A:** See, look at you triggering yourself right into I'm 50 again. This is freaking nuts.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Because like a week ago, it was like I needed all that unwholesome— I believed I needed all those unwholesome thoughts to trigger the joy. But now I'm seeing when there's less unwholesome thoughts, it's like, okay, all right. And there have been some fears.

**Speaker A:** The conditioning. Yeah, for the fears. Let's hang on for that. Let's go back and look at the point that that conditioning is that you got to work in order to eat. That's just playing out at a more subtle level. And now you're recognizing, no, you don't even have to work to eat the best joyful pie of the mind that you can create because we've got the triggers now. We know the steps so that we can put ourselves into that elated place. This is freaking nuts. It really is.

**Speaker B:** Now, I just use that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's that recognition then that you were beginning to control the mind that is now free from the burden of delayed gratification, that you do have permission to cheat and get all the joy you want without hurting anyone. And you don't get caught.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I'm giving myself permission. I'm giving myself permission. I'm like, I'm next to my girlfriend, and sometimes I'm like thinking she must think I'm weird, and I'm like, oh, this feels so good right next to her. I'm just like, oh, this is so nice. And, and when I notice that judgment, I'm like, ah, axe that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, here's what you can do with that. You can say to her, just to pass that on in a really interesting and real way for an ordinary person, as you can say, wow, it feels so good now to be with you.

**Speaker B:** I do that too. I do that too. Yeah, yeah, I caught my— I was like cuddling with her tonight, I mean this morning, and I was like, I normally would like hold myself back from expressing feeling so good because I would think it would make me look needy or clingy or weak or whatever, you know, because here's the guy, the guy's supposed to be the strong rock, and here he is like 'Oh, this feels so good.' And I was like, 'Nope, accent that, accent that.' 'Oh, it feels so good to be in your arms right now. Oh, this feels so good.' And she looked at me and she's like, you know, she just laughs at me, she just smiles. So it's really nice.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what friendship and Sangha is all about. Yeah, finding some joy and spreading it with others.

**Speaker B:** So the other thing I wanted to say is like, it's funny, right? The one that was coming up the most is the one that's still coming up, but it comes up less. It does come up less. And what that is, is— okay, well,

**Speaker A:** that's the first question that you had.

**Speaker B:** Well, congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can see it when it does come up. Don't worry about when it doesn't, because that's just another one of them that comes up, right? Exactly.

**Speaker B:** I noticed that one too. It's like, wait, where are the— where are the unwholesome thoughts. And I was like, oh, that's okay, I'll axe that one too. But the one that comes up is like, I'm afraid I'm going to lose this, or I'm afraid I need to do something because I don't have unwholesome thoughts triggering my joy. I'm afraid I need to do something. And then I can see that, I'm like, oh, that triggers the joy. There we go.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's cluing into that whole quality of the expectations that we built up Yeah, almost. You could say that the whole pile of it is our life story. Yeah. But in that moment is the expectation, just like Jeff was talking about, the expectation of the feeling of fear comes up on the out-breath because the expectation there may be some trouble.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's really interesting. It's like I would say like on the outermost layer, this thought, the way it's manifested is I need to do something with my life. I need a purpose. I need to do something new. I need a new job. And I used to like obsess over that.

**Speaker A:** I know. Yeah. You need to be able to enjoy your life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Obsess over that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I used to obsess over like purpose and the job and this and that. And I think that comes from— Oh,

**Speaker A:** that's the whole point. Let's go back to that. What is the purpose of life?

**Speaker B:** To enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** To enjoy it. What else could there possibly be a purpose to life?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not, it's not that we have to kind of— if you want

**Speaker A:** to talk about in Christian terms, God gave you life for you to enjoy it, right?

**Speaker B:** No, I, I'm with you on that. I'm saying I used to see it the other way, that I gotta, I gotta focus on a purpose, I gotta, I gotta get this job, I gotta be this kind of person. You know, I got to do personal development.

**Speaker A:** The religion. Yeah. And the spiritual. The spiritual is God gave you life for you to enjoy it. And religion comes by and says you can't until you do what I tell you to do. We've got a— we've got the inside dope here. And you can't— yeah, you've got your toy, but you can't turn it on or play with it until we tell you to. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Until you— yeah, until you pray enough,

**Speaker A:** until you pray, whatever it is that we give ourselves, because that always becomes an internal thing and that it happens just at the point of time in meditation for us to now be able to see that mechanism that's been driving our lives.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's been really cool. The other thing I wanted to share with you is that I came up with this new image that is some— it's, it's more gentle than the axe. It's instead imagining I'm like, Anicca, like my— no, like my whole being is like made of water. And I'm like, swishing it toward them to rush into me and give them a big hug. So it's like, it's like this big burst of like love and power, you know, it's like, oh, oh, you're worried about something? Oh, come here. You know, rather than like, yeah. So it's, it's, it's, I'm noticing it's like getting softer image.

**Speaker A:** But it's right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And I noticed that it changes my being too. That, that image is starting to look different on the outside too. I'm like smiling differently. I'm behaving softer. It's, it's just incredible.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations. Success stories. I really like the success stories.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations to you too, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm just having fun. I'm just here for the show. Well, in that way, I mean, that's what the conductor of the orchestra is doing too. I mean, why would you be a conductor of an orchestra if you really didn't enjoy the show?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but the dancers on the stage, they're doing their thing, and they're the ones who need to be congratulated for their own mental new choreography.

**Speaker B:** True, but it is a congratulations to you too. That is a congratulations to you too, because you have helped me develop the enthusiasm to light my own fire, to light my own engine, or just to spark my own engine.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's all I've got is a spark. The blowing and the fire is all up to you and the kindling. But I will come by and light your fire if you let me.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you know, I'll let you.

**Speaker A:** Great. Because a lot of people would prefer to blow me off, which is okay. Yeah. That in fact, one of the things that I told Kishon, and this is very true of the Dharma, that a lot of people have the idea that the more the merrier. Actually means we're not successful until we get everybody. But the Buddha talked about it in the way of the Sangha, of just a few good men, that in a way we can say that we're not the army here. We don't go draft recruits and try to train them. All we want is a few good men or women. I mean, it's not a sexual thing, but the phrase for the Marines is "just a few good men." Because let us say that there was— you know the difference between a zero-sum game and a non-zero-sum game? A zero-sum game is when there is only so much. And it has to be shared. And so if A gets 4, then B can't have 7 if there's only 10 there. Okay. And if B demands to have 7, now we've got conflict. But there is also a non-zero-sum game where everybody can win. And we need to try to change the mentality from a zero-sum game into a non-zero-sum game. But that can't happen because society operates with a zero-sum game. So that what that would mean is, is that— and this happens with a lot of gurus, I've seen it— and that is that so many students come around and they all are fighting with each other for proximity to the teacher. In that regard, very, very few students are actually going to get all that the teacher has to say. But if the teacher has only 1 or 2 or 3 students, then those 3 or 4 students can really get it. And if they get it, then when the crowd of people then come to the guru, he's got help, he's got a Sangha. Already formed. And that's what I'm seeing now, the need of— rather than me just teaching individual students here and there— no, it's time the students who are capable of growing in their own next step, Dharma, can help each other do that. That, that's what the real teaching of the Buddha is, is when we got Sangha going, when we got a community of people who were helping each other, joyfully spreading joy to each other. And so this is what is the Triple Gem. You know, you've heard about that— the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. And yet in Western Buddhism, they have almost no emphasis upon Sangha, and almost everything that Western Buddhism has is meditation. That's the whole sum of their game, which basically then winds up being dukkha, dukkha, dukkha. Where's the dukkha? Got a lot of dukkha here. Maybe this dukkha connects to that Dukkha, and now I've got even more Dukkha. And we're going to get to the bottom of this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Dukkha, more Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** We're going to get to the bottom. There's got to be a pony in this barrel of horseshit someplace, is the mentality that humans have. In other words, if you practice long enough, then you will get a reward. That's an old joke, by the way. Even though I've told you the punchline, I'll tell you the joke. Mother had twins. One of them was a perpetual optimist and the other was a perpetual pessimist. And she took them to the psychiatrist in early December and he said, well, Christmas is coming, so this is what we're going to do. All the toys that you would have given to both of them, give them to the pessimist. And for the little kid who is an pessimist, give him a 55-gallon big oil barrel full of horse manure, and that's his Christmas. And so Mom walks into the child's bedroom of the pessimist, and there he is crashing and breaking the toys on the floor, and he's frustrated and doesn't know what to do and says, where's my this, that, and the other? Which didn't happen because Mom didn't know that he wanted this, that, and the other. So she closes the door, disappointed. She goes to the door of her other son and opens the door, and there he is standing in this barrel of horseshit, hooking it up both hands at the time and throwing it all over the room saying, 'Whippy, whippy!' And she looks at him and says, 'What are you doing?' And he says, 'With all this horseshit, there's got to be a pony in here someplace.'

**Speaker B:** Oh my God, that's funny.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's your Western meditator. Digging deep in their barrel of horseshit thinking there's a pony at the bottom.

**Speaker B:** It's, it's so funny because I just saw this, like, optimism and pessimism are two sides of the same coin as they both destroy each other. They both are their own, um, demise.

**Speaker A:** They're both delusional. They're both delusional.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're their own destruction. They're both their own conflict, their own demise. The conflict of the optimist, he corrodes himself with shit so that he can get to the light at the end of the tunnel. The pessimist cannot enjoy what's there that they have. And so they destroy it, and so both end up destroying themselves looking for something else.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** It's fucking awesome. That's so cool to see.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's why it becomes cool, is because we can see it. Yeah, we could see these both sides of that. We could see that chin hidden behind the nose.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, whereas the middle, the middle way is just when you have a bucket of shit, you learn to see that you can, you can clean off that bucket, right? You can, you can, you could take the bucket and empty it out. You can, you could take the bucket, turn it upside down and stand on top of it and wave to everybody, right?

**Speaker A:** And jump it, jump for joy. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** So, and in the house, that's Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that's what we would talk about, uh, changing any lemon into lemonade.

**Speaker B:** That's attitude right there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. It's the attitude. Changing it by adding a teaspoon of sugar. Put some joy in the juice and you've got lemonade. Yeah, rather than it's just bitter. But we have to remember to do that rather than just being disappointed with the bitter, hoping it to be better. Maybe if I get used to it, it'll be sweet tasting. Because in fact, we can get used to anything. Yeah, you can put up with anything. Yeah, even when we don't even know it, understand it, or look at it, just repetitive. That's part of the human mind, is repetitive over and over and over and over and over again. And that's what we've been doing with the unwholesome. Now we're beginning to change that pattern.

**Speaker B:** And 28 years, 28 years, and, and this pattern could change. And they can change in a few weeks, a month. That's nuts. That's nuts. It's freaking nuts. It's freaking nuts.

**Speaker A:** It's fucking great. It is. That's right. That we can change.

**Speaker B:** And you know, it's funny, like, I just noticed I'm starting to notice the trouble that I'm saving myself because usually I would say like, oh, that's great. And then there'd be like a tinge of, oh, you don't really believe that, or it's not completely great. But that wasn't there just now. It was, it was like missing. It was like, where— that's gone. That's not there.

**Speaker A:** That's right. The more you practice the wholesome, the less unwholesome you have to deal with. So we've got 3 triggers in there, not one just to trigger, Baha, I see you, Mara. But aha, you're not there, Mara, is the second trigger. And then the third trigger is, gosh, where have you been? I haven't seen you in so long.

**Speaker B:** And that's why when unwholesome comes back, hello darkness, my old friend, seems so easy. And it makes sense because it's like, oh, well, hey, I know you. I know you.

**Speaker A:** I know you. I've seen you before.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so now where we're at is starting to notice more of the wholesome thoughts. Now we're going to start noticing the wholesome thoughts. It's interesting because the wholesome thoughts are very deliberate. Whereas I would say the unwholesome thoughts were habits, you know?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. So now what we're going to start looking at is that deliberation. If you say that these are deliberate thoughts, okay, what does that mean? In other words, how is my Sati? How often does deliberation happen or deliberate happen? What does deliberate look like?

**Speaker B:** Deliberate looks like when I'm feeling good,

**Speaker A:** I'm like, oh, that's a rhetorical question for you to go investigate. That's, that's the what's next with this is that now that we've gotten the mind wholesome, let's go look at all these aspects of wholesome mind, which are in fact the Four Noble Truths or the Eightfold Noble Path in the sense of how is my Sati, how is my investigation, how is my effort, how is my attitude, how is my being able to sustain being in a good place? How can I have— how is my way of applying it to come back when I'm not in that good state? How can I get back into it? All of this is the stuff that now is needed to be investigated. Okay. Including that this is freaking nuts. What does that freaking nuts sound or feel like on the inside? What is it that gets us to raise our hands in that kind of joy? And what is that joy? So this is something now that we can investigate. Uh-huh. So you got to have a whole lot of that. Oh, wow. This is freaking nuts in order to be able to see all that. Wait a minute. What is going on here? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I wanted to say that the joy that I'm experiencing, like, you know, we said like eat too much of donuts, too much donuts. I've noticed the belief creep in or the thought creep in like, oh, if I'm not eating enough donuts, I'm not going to have enough joy. But I just axed that one too. But what I've noticed is that my joy is more, it's more calm. It's more just, it's not really anything significant. It's just kind of— It's kind of

**Speaker A:** satisfactory rather than successful. Yeah, success has that quality of wow in it. Yeah, but satisfaction has more of the quality of the relief.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's not even like feeling intensely good. It's more like, oh, this is— yeah,

**Speaker A:** feeling good without it being intense is even kind of better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like, oh, this feels nice. This is good.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? This is all in the Suttas.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure it is. It really is.

**Speaker A:** Even talked about it directly, yes, that sometimes too many donuts is too much. Sometimes the exuberance is, okay, I got a load of it now, now I really see it, let me relax even from that, that I'm even more satisfied because I know that I can control that elation.

**Speaker B:** And I think one of the reasons why, I don't know if you remember, but I think reason doesn't really matter. But I think one of the reasons why I'm having so much progress with this is because I've had 1.5 to 2 years of intense staring at my Dukkha. So, I have like the seeing capability of it. You just helped me.

**Speaker A:** Years. Okay, 10 years of intense going to India kind of practice meditation, living in the ashrams and staying with Goenka before I met Bhikkhuni. So I was ready for him.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. And that's how I picked me up

**Speaker A:** and turned me on my head. Wow. Wow.

**Speaker B:** That's what you've done with me then, huh?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I mean, it's really great. It's really great that I have the same seeing now, but it's matched with right view, right effort, right attitude, seeing that I can do something about the Dukkha, seeing that I have— Right now

**Speaker A:** that you don't have to do something now to get finished with it later, right? That's the trick, that this is a now kind of thing. This is not a— and as we do it more and more, we gain the skills to get better and better at it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we get more interested in doing it right now.

**Speaker A:** Enthusiastic, eager, eager, eager right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And I wanted to say there's a couple of moments where I checked in today and I was like, wait, I need to be on guard. I'm going to be on guard because I don't know if I'm missing unwholesome thoughts or not. But then like another hour would go by and it'd be like, wait, I need to be on guard, but there's no unwholesome. There's no unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** So it's like, this is reminding yourself, waking up and reminding, but you've got to be on guard. Listen to that. You've got to rather than, wow, isn't it nice to be on guard?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Isn't it nice to watch what's going on? To enjoy the show. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So it's normal then for it to feel like the same as it was before you started practicing Dhamma, where you're not really actually aware that you're not aware because there's less to be aware of that is hindering?

**Speaker A:** No, you're aware that there is less to be aware of.

**Speaker B:** That there's less to be aware of.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. You're aware that there's less to be aware of.

**Speaker B:** But being aware of less to be aware of doesn't really seem like anything because you can't see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You can't see what's not there. It's just not there.

**Speaker A:** So there's nothing for the cowherd to do. He doesn't have to get up and chase after the cows with the sticks anymore because the cows are okay. Yeah, so he just sits and everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's finish this now, but I do want to tell you this much right now. Congratulations, you're moving. And I also really appreciate your, um, participation in the Sangha groups and Discord and whatnot. That's great.

**Speaker B:** I haven't really been on Discord much, but, um, I love the Skype Sangha. And, uh, Keyshawn— Keyshawn and I are becoming good friends.

**Speaker A:** That's what friends are for.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent, Alex. Well, we'll, we'll hear you next time. Check in soon and, and we'll do it again.

**Speaker B:** Okay, keep going.

**Speaker A:** You're on the right track. You're, you're doing just fine and getting the benefit of it, so you know you are.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, great.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend, Alex (Speaker B), centers on Alex's recent breakthrough in meditation practice and the profound shift in his relationship with thoughts and emotions. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Theme: The Shift from Struggle to Relief**
Alex reports moving from an effortful, combative practice (mentally "axing" unwholesome thoughts) to a gentler, more integrated state where wholesome thoughts and feelings arise naturally. The discussion explores the joy, relief, and deeper understanding that comes with this shift.

### **Key Discussion Points:**

1.  **Wholesome Tears and Relief:** Alex describes a tender moment with his girlfriend where he cried, not from distress, but from a sense of relief and vulnerability. Dhammarato reframes this not as a weakness, but as "the tears of an Arahant"—tears of profound relief and clarity upon seeing reality as it is, free from clinging. This is contrasted with tears of self-pity or loss.

2.  **The Evolution of Practice:** Alex explains how his practice has matured:
    *   **From "Axe" to "Hug":** He moved from forcefully cutting off unwholesome thoughts to a softer, more welcoming approach ("a big burst of love and power").
    *   **From Triggered Joy to Abiding Joy:** Initially, noticing an unwholesome thought was a *trigger* to generate wholesome joy. Now, he experiences a more constant, calm, and satisfactory joy that doesn't depend on a "problem" to solve. The wholesome mental state is becoming the new normal.

3.  **Investigating the New Normal:** As unwholesome thoughts become less frequent and potent, Alex and Dhammarato explore what to investigate next:
    *   Is the mind actually more wholesome, or is he just noticing less? They conclude the skill has improved, leading to genuine change.
    *   The new focus becomes investigating the **wholesome state itself**: the quality of joy, the right attitude, and the sustained feeling of relief.
    *   Dhammarato introduces new "triggers" for gladness: 1) Catching an unwholesome thought, 2) Noticing the mind is *already* wholesome, and 3) Reflecting on how long it's been since unwholesome states arose.

4.  **The Role of Sangha and Right View:** Dhammarato emphasizes the critical importance of **Sangha** (spiritual community) for mutual support and spreading joy, critiquing Western Buddhism's overemphasis on solitary meditation. The talk highlights how Alex's previous years of observing *dukkha* (suffering) prepared him, but it was applying **Right View** and **Right Effort** that allowed transformation.

5.  **Metaphors and Analogies:** Dhammarato uses several powerful analogies:
    *   **The Optical Illusion:** Seeing both the "vase" and the "faces" represents the shift in perception from a limited, suffering-based view of life to a liberated one that includes beauty and relief.
    *   **The Cowherd:** Once the cows (the mind) are settled and safe, the cowherd (the meditator) can relax and simply watch with gentle awareness, without constant intervention.
    *   **The Barrel of Manure:** The optimist (digging for a pony) and the pessimist (angry at his gifts) represent two deluded extremes. The Middle Way is to clean out the barrel (the mind) and use it as a foundation for joy.

### **Conclusion: A Celebration of Progress**
The talk concludes with mutual congratulations. Alex is celebrated for his rapid progress and for embodying the practice—moving from struggle to a gentle, abiding satisfaction. Dhammarato reinforces that the **purpose of the path is to enjoy life now**, not to defer joy for a future achievement. The session ends on a note of shared joy and the importance of community in sustaining the practice.

**In essence, the talk documents a practitioner's transition from doing battle with his mind to learning to dwell peacefully within it, discovering that joy and relief are not rewards for hard work but natural states uncovered through right understanding and gentle, persistent awareness.**

### Metaphors and Stories

This conversation between a teacher (Speaker A, Dhammarato) and a student (Speaker B, Alex) is rich with metaphors and stories used to illustrate spiritual and psychological concepts. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Axe (and its Evolution):**
    *   **What it is:** The student's primary metaphor for his practice of cutting off unwholesome thoughts.
    *   **Evolution:** He describes it starting as a forceful, dramatic action—an "action figure... in my head" throwing an axe at a big target. It then evolves into something "more gentle," and finally transforms into a completely different image: a wave of water or a burst of love that embraces and absorbs the thought rather than attacking it. This illustrates the progression from forceful suppression to gentle, compassionate awareness.

2.  **Tears of the Arahant:**
    *   **What it is:** A central metaphor introduced by the teacher to reframe the student's experience of crying.
    *   **Meaning:** These are not tears of desperation, self-pity, or loss. They are "tears of relief" and joy that come from the profound understanding and letting go of suffering. They represent the beauty and release found in seeing reality clearly, even its tragic aspects.

3.  **The Vase/Face & Young/Old Woman Illusions:**
    *   **What it is:** Classic optical illusions used as an analogy for "right view" or shifting one's frame of reference.
    *   **Meaning:** Most people see only one reality (the vase, the young woman)—the conventional, suffering-filled world ("life is shit and then you die"). The practice allows you to see the hidden image (the face, the old woman)—the deeper truth of impermanence and the possibility of release. The master sees *both* and the artistry of the whole.

4.  **The Cowherd:**
    *   **What it is:** An analogy from the suttas (likely MN 19).
    *   **Meaning:** At first, the cowherd (the meditator) must actively watch and guide the cows (the mind) with a stick (effort). Once the cows are safely in the pasture (the mind is wholesome), he can sit under a tree and simply watch them with relaxed awareness. This describes the shift from strenuous effort to vigilant ease.

5.  **The Mother with the Infant in a Hammock (Sarong):**
    *   **What it is:** An analogy from the Visuddhimagga.
    *   **Meaning:** When the infant (the mind) is restless, the mother (sati/mindfulness) must watch it intently. When the infant is asleep (the mind is calm), she only needs to glance at it occasionally as it swings in and out of her field of vision. This illustrates "unremitting mindfulness"—not constant strain, but a gentle, periodic checking-in.

6.  **The Barrel of Horseshit (The Pony Joke):**
    *   **What it is:** A humorous story contrasting the optimist and the pessimist.
    *   **Meaning:** The pessimist destroys his gifts (toys). The optimist joyfully digs through a barrel of manure (dukkha/suffering), believing "there's got to be a pony in here someplace!" The teacher uses this to critique a certain type of Western meditation that endlessly analyzes suffering, hoping to find a prize at the bottom. The "middle way" is to clean out the barrel or simply stand on it—to deal with suffering skillfully, not just dig in it.

7.  **Climbing the Mountain (Zen Story):**
    *   **What it is:** A well-known Zen parable.
    *   **Meaning:** First, mountains are mountains (ordinary perception). Then, mountains are not mountains (analytical, deconstructed perception). Finally, mountains are again mountains (perception returns to the ordinary but is now infused with profound understanding and is completely different). This mirrors the student's feeling that his mind now seems like it did before practice, but from a totally new, liberated perspective.

8.  **Donuts:**
    *   **What it is:** A metaphor for joy or wholesome feelings.
    *   **Meaning:** Earlier, the student worried about "eating too many donuts" (overdoing exhilaration). Later, he fears not having enough donuts (not enough triggers for joy). The teacher points out that joy can become a calm, sustained satisfaction rather than an intense, triggered sugar rush.

9.  **The Conductor and the Orchestra:**
    *   **What it is:** A metaphor the teacher uses for his role.
    *   **Meaning:** He is the conductor who enjoys the show (the student's progress), but the real work and artistry belong to the dancers and musicians (the students themselves). He just provides the spark and the framework.

10. **Spark, Kindling, and Fire:**
    *   **What it is:** A metaphor for the teacher-student relationship.
    *   **Meaning:** The teacher can offer a "spark" of inspiration, but the student must provide the "kindling" (practice, effort) and fan it into their own "fire" of understanding.

### **Key Stories & References**

1.  **Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony ("Pathétique"):**
    *   **Use:** Cited as an example of art that evokes the "tears of an Arahant"—profound, beautiful sadness that touches the soul and brings relief, not despair.

2.  **Ajahn Maha Boowa's "Toilet Bowl of Shit":**
    *   **Use:** A direct, harsh metaphor from a Thai forest ajahn. It describes human society (and the untrained mind) as a toilet full of excrement, where each "turd" (person) thinks they're unique. The sadness and beauty come from seeing this truth clearly, which leads to relief, not disgust.

3.  **Jesus's "In the world, but not of the world":**
    *   **Use:** Linked to the Buddha's teaching and the mountain story. It describes the state of being fully engaged in life yet not enslaved by its cravings and delusions, having seen the "other face" in the illusion.

4.  **The Twins (Optimist & Pessimist) Joke:**
    *   **Use:** As detailed above, to critique unskillful approaches to suffering and joy.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories collectively chart a path from **forceful doing** to **gentle being**, from **seeing only suffering** to **finding relief in clear comprehension**, and from **needing external triggers** to **abiding in intrinsic, calm joy**. They move from imagery of combat (axe) to imagery of care (mother, cowherd), integration (water hug), and liberated perspective (optical illusions, mountain).
