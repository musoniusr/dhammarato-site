### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think I started watching a little bit before, around the time Alex started doing calls with you, because I definitely remember when Alex started, and I remember watching that process and just being kind of impressed seeing him going from someone who didn't really know that much about Adama to you know, really becoming well developed. So yeah, and I guess another one of the other main reasons I called is because I guess I just had questions about like how to handle certain.

**Speaker B:** Things.

**Speaker A:** And part regarding the temple that I've been visiting. I'm just like unclear on how to handle certain things, I guess, and how to handle this.

**Speaker B:** Let me take 5 seconds. I need to stop dogs growling at one another.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. So go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's pretty much all I was saying was like I was just calling because I felt like it felt appropriate at this time to go ahead and do that. I felt like, well, you know, I've been meditating for a little while now and I've been kind of wanting to actually have some sort of person to actually talk with about it. And.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. Yeah, yes, Dhamma is for sharing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. Um, and I've noticed that like if I talk with people about it that, you know, don't participate or something like that, it's just like sometimes difficult to have those conversations.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's especially true in places like Tulsa.

**Speaker A:** Tulsa's a wild town for sure.

**Speaker B:** Uh, there's a whole lot of dissatisfied, unhappy people.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And that they think that if they can make other people follow their rules so that they don't have to follow them themselves, then they will be powerful and happy, right? Um, that in fact, uh, I know quite a lot about that, that culture, and that it seems to be actually worse now than it was But the important point is to be able to see the dangers they're in, and start to avoid those situations, not only in the sense of going along with them, but rather also to get away from them. It's the better thing to do. And so I'm really pleased that you've gotten established a bit. In a Taiwad. I didn't think about it until you mentioned that there's a Taiwad in Tulsa. But also, you mentioned that all of the Asians within probably quite a distance are collecting together.

**Speaker A:** Vietnamese.

**Speaker B:** And all of that. Well, that's very typical. Throughout the United States; that whatever borders or boundaries were there on the terrain of Asia, get melted into the Asian Buddhist culture of America. And there it is, a bright, shining, happy, wholesome system of about 500 watts that the Westerners don't even know about. And they would never consider it, and possibly the reason for that is language as well as culture. And so I'm really pleased that you were capable of making that leap. That would be really an advantage. I'm looking for guys who have spent some time in Asian Watch, to help promote it within the wider community of our groups, and on Skype. So you've gotten that information, I invite you to join our group. That what most Western Buddhists miss would be— let's look at it from the perspective of the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. Their Dharma is badly translated. They haven't seen a Buddha in hundreds of years, and they don't even know what Sangha is. And so, what we need to do is to reintroduce it as the Triple Gem, that in fact, when the Dhamma is correctly understood, there's the Buddha right there. And then the question is, where is the Sangha that they don't even know that exists? Of the West, don't even know about it. That in fact, not long ago, someone was saying that, "I would like to be a student of yours, but I disagree with your politics." Wait a minute, the whole teaching is, stop having politics. We couldn't get out to the idea that Sangha is actually not political. Right. A community that people would live in, like a wat, is not political. That in fact, any politics that are in the wat is actually getting there by mistake out of the minds of the people who came to be in a place where there was no politics.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Kind of, they brought it in with them. But the whole idea is that we can find This Sangha, this friendship, this companionship with the people who know and understand the Dharma, is already in the West. And if we can get guys interested all over to start spending more time at the Wat and less time in Reddit, that it would be greatly to their advantage. To meet some people. You see, it's very rarely, even for people who go on retreats, it's very rarely and unlikely for them to meet and be around people who were born Buddhist. Almost all the Western people will be getting into to Buddhism from adulthood, mainly because you're trying to take a bath from whatever they were taught before. They call it, uh, what, recovering.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And so that's where most Buddhists are, are people who were looking for something because whatever they had isn't good enough. Well, if they listen to the teachings of the Buddha correctly, they'll hear it as like, yeah, that's right, look at the fact that you keep seeing things are not good enough. The Christianity is okay, except that everybody who's in it thinks it's not good enough, it needs to be fixed, it needs to get political, it needs to get not political. Needs to raise money, it needs to stop talking about money. And so Christianity winds up being more of a punching bag than an actual method where people can come together in communion, come together in sanctuary. The very things that they want are actually mentioned as the qualities of the religion, and yet the people who come into religion bring their old stuff with them. A really clear example of that happened in the time of Asoka, which I mentioned before, is because he wanted to spread the teachings of the Buddha around. He actually promoted it in a way that big money would promote anything, in the sense of inviting people to change what religion that you have. He would give free robes, he'd build hotels or monasteries or something like that for the monks. He gave them the equipment, the tools and things that they needed in and whatnot like that. And so, in the area around Rajagiri, they had so many monks, that was the capital city at the time, that the nobles, the old guard, those who actually knew the teachings of the Buddha, saw that things had gotten out of hand, because the students didn't have a teacher, so they taught each other. And so this was the great time when all the magic beliefs and all of the Hinduism and all of that stuff started to infiltrate into the teachings of the Buddha. It's also the time when the great divide happened. The original group called for a meeting, called for a Grand Council. And that they wanted only nobles there. And so King Asoka says, fine, I'll support it in the capital. Bad idea. They should have had that council way out in the sticks, way out in the woods. But because it's a grand affair in the city, all of the monks who didn't get into the council were unhappy. So they decided they'd have a Mahasangha, a Mahakaya, and that was the beginning of Mahayana Buddhism. Was that there was a split at that time, but it was a split of jealousy of knowledge. And so the question would be, well, how do you know whether you got into that group or not? How would nobles recognize nobles? The answer to that is that if you are— they say it takes one to know one, and there are certain questions to be asked. And if you answer those questions in Hindu words, then you're not invited in. Okay, and so there's There's various ways of telling, but what had happened is that it got separated, not within the division of necessarily Mahayana and Theravada, whatever the real issue was, the breaking within the Sangha between the nobles, which in the original Sangha, everybody was coming in to become noble. It was a noble organization. Now it became two. It became an organization within an organization. The real Sangha is not the Sangha of monks, or it's not even the Sangha of lay people, but the real Sangha is the Sangha of nobles. They got hidden away and kept safe and secure and all of that, because there were some pretty bad times that happened in India. And so, it also got dispersed into China, Thailand, Western Asia. In fact, it got right into Pakistan and onwards that way. And then when Islam came back, they pretty much destroyed Buddhism right into India. They didn't get into Burma, but they might try. But in any case, the Western Buddhism we have came completely differently. Buddhism was brought to the West by treasure hunters, not by nobles. And because of that, Westerners have always had that treasure hunter mentality. With the Christians talking about bowing and scraping and praying to a stone statue and all of that kind of stuff, it's just coming out of their understanding of it, as well as all of the bad understandings of the actual teachings of the Buddha, which was Christian to begin with. That's why words like Dukkha are translated as suffering, right? Why would they translate it? That's a fairly bad translation. In fact, imagine that you were a Jehovah's Witness kind of Buddhist going around with your tracts knocking on doors and saying, here, read this and it will free you from suffering. And nobody would say, forget it, I'm not suffering. Nobody would admit to suffering. Nobody is suffering, but we are quite often dissatisfied, right? But often, and when we're around other people who are dissatisfied, then we take on their dissatisfactions also. And so when we're little kids and you're having parents that are dissatisfied, they're going to pass that dissatisfaction down to us. It's almost like a mental virus that they give us, that really little— Can.

**Speaker A:** I ask you, how does that work? Like, because I have noticed that a lot where I'll see other people dissatisfied with something and I just almost mirror it or copy it, or, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, you could call it— in an instinctual language, it would be imprinting.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** In common language, we would say monkey see, monkey do. Mom will often ask their kids, well, why are you going to do it? Because he did it. If your friend stuck his head in the oven, would you stick your head? Yeah. Ah, so that's it. That's, that's the answer to your question. Why do we follow our instincts? Right. Another way Okay, we take that down a little bit into actually the nesting instinct, right? Because if you don't get along with the nest, the nest is going to throw you out, and the nest may be quite dangerous if you're not in it. Either an insider or an outsider. And so we long with that intensity of instinctual Your survival depends upon your ability to get along with others. And so we wind up getting along with the wrong people, doing things that we're told to do, rather than doing what we want to do. And so we resent it. I have never met a student ever who actually claimed that they really liked first grade. Sit down, read your book, do your ABCs, do your 1-2-3s. Very few children actually enjoy the first grade, and those who are best prepared for the first grade are the ones who were most miserable in the first grade. So, in that regard, you can say that from childhood, we are not only born as a victim, But we are taught that we are a victim and that you have to go along to get along. This is what makes a politician, is to get powerful enough so that you can make changes to the things so that you can get your way. Because we never think that we ever get it our own way. And the Buddhist teaching is to stop having your way. That's the problem, is either getting your way or not getting your way is a problem. So just start getting along happily is the better way of looking at it, rather than getting along and resenting it. Do what you want to do and do it happily. Rather than doing it because you were told to do it. So that's basically the answer to that question. And in fact, we've gone quite deeply into Paticcasamuppada in that regard, that we wind up being in that woeful state of being an animal, a dumb animal that does what it's told to do, because the dumb animal becomes a dumb animal because he'll do things that he doesn't want to to do, to stay in them. Also, besides being a nesting instinct, you could call it the herd, herding instinct, or the— you could also call it the mob mentality. Sure. And so this is one of the things then to start waking up to. Is recognizing that you're doing something that you don't want to do. So you can set it down, take a deep breath, and say, wow, I don't have to do that right now. Let me get to a really, really good state, and then I might want to do it while I'm feeling good. Right now I don't want to do it. Look how I'm feeling. So this is actually quite an important point, this issue of why do we go along. Monkey see, monkey do, imprinting, is because we're doing it ignorantly. We're letting it be done by the automatic pilot right down to our gene level, instead of acting wisely. The whole teaching of the Buddha is to wake up and take a look. At these instincts, to wake up and take a look at these unwholesome thoughts that come out of these instincts, to wake up and recognize that we are already built in with a victim's attitude that was instinctual. It was instinctual when we were born, and it was then pounded into us by the society. Giving a few people a great longing to get out. But they're wrong in the sense that they think that they can become Prime Minister or Chief or something, and then be getting their way instead of in a situation of being subordinate to someone else and doing what you're told to do. What they don't recognize is that everybody, even the guy in charge, It's just going along to get along. Everybody— I mean, Dante's pyramid, if you've seen it, you have all of these human bodies climbing up, and the guy who's on the top, guess what's happening with him? He's got 6 arms grabbing him by the feet, pulling him back down so that one of the other guys can get on Right. So even the guy in charge doesn't get his way.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay. But there's another way of looking at it, and that is that if you can see clearly what's going on, instead of wanting what you want, you'll begin to want the right things because you know that you can get them. But this is wisdom, is learning to figure out how to aim our ambitions rather than keeping shooting ourselves in the foot. Or another way of saying it is see how things are headed. We don't know where that bullet's going to land, but you can sure see which direction their barrel is pointed, right? I don't know when the gun's going to go off, but you know that you don't want to be standing in front of that gun when it does. So this then is getting back to the issue of the, uh, Eightfold Noble Path and how the three gems are wrapped up in there, because we are societal animals. The Buddha has in fact got one sutta, uh, The funny part is the name of the sutta is the Half Sutta.

**Speaker A:** I haven't heard of that one.

**Speaker B:** Well, the Half Sutta is where Ananda approaches the Buddha after having a long talk with Ananda, excuse me, with Shariputta. And Ananda announces to the Buddha that friendship is half the Dhamma. Oh, okay. And the Buddha corrected him. He says, oh no, friendship is the Dhamma. That's all we've got. That's the only thing that there is. It's 100% of the Dhamma is friendship. Now where people get the half and half stuff is the, uh, natural division that we make between the inside and the outside. Dealing with the people that you're living with and all the people that are around you, that's one half, those on the outside. But the more important one is becoming friends with the ones on the inside. The crowd that we have within have to be brought into unison, or within the context of the Samadhi mind. To get the mind together, to become whole, become unified. And the only way that we're going to be able to do that is to stop having the war inside. Because what happens with us as children is that not only do we get told what to do, we remember what we're told to do. And then we go around with all of these remembrances of all of these rules and things that we're told to do. This is what the Buddha called Sila Bhanta Paramasa and what Eric Byrne calls the parent ego state and what Freud called the superego. So this superego, this parent ego state, this collection of rules is also registering in the mid-cortex of the brain, called the temporal lobe, the middle part, as opposed to the problem-solving machine that humans have that the other animals don't have, as well as a huge, huge cerebellum in the back. That's the way that we do our reasoning, and we spend most of our time not in reasoning, but in the back of the brain, the reptilian brain, the anterior cortex rather than the frontal cortex. Another way of saying it is that we spend so much more time in instinctual behavior. Another way of saying it is that we spend so much of our time doing what we feel to do, that we are driven by the feelings that are instinctual, our automatic pilot. Automatic pilots are great to save the pilot a lot of extra work. You know, on a big aircraft, an airliner, there's an automatic pilot, but that automatic pilot, you can't use it on takeoff and landings. You can't do it when you're heading into a mountain or in a storm. You got to take control, right? And so this is actually practicing doing this for the pilot. The frontal cortex is to take control of this craft instead of having it on automatic pilot, the instinct. And so this whole quality of friendship then is that we need to get this automatic pilot functioning correctly. Because it's at war with itself, right? Right. Because we've got all of these rules and regulations that are often contradictory, and that they're not according to what we want to do anyway. So the act— the idea is, is that, oh, I'm going to go on a diet, and then I firmly on a diet, and then the— then I get in front of the refrigerator and open the door, and where's the diet? Now the diet is guilty, okay? Because we're a crowd and we change back and forth. And, um, uh, that in fact one of the signs of a unified mind is confusion because we don't know what to do. Yeah, yeah. And another one is a sign of a mind that's not unified is when we lie. When we lie to ourselves, we lie to other people. That's a disunity. And lying is something that we do to enemies, not to our friends. Okay, so if we're lying to ourselves about our religion or our beliefs or our political views or any of that kind of stuff, then lying means that we're not looking at the evidence that's right in front of us.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** You've already made a predetermined position, no matter how wrongly it fits with reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is what teaching for the Buddha is, is keep remembering to wake up and look at what's real right now. What's real? Not what's real in a big sense, but what's real in the sense of our senses. Okay, let's come to our senses. That's a very interesting word. I love it. Think about that. Coming to our senses means getting out of the noggin and getting into sensory awareness, in the here-now, into the present moment.

**Speaker A:** The heat of the moment.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but where's the heat coming from? Wake up and recognize that we're the heat. We're making things hot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then we can come off, we can take it off the heat, we can take it off the grinder. We thought we were polishing it and all we're doing is making sparks, right? So that's the idea then of Anapanasati, is to come out of the unwholesome thoughts. The heat of the moment and come into reality is that there's no reason for me to be making heat right now, right? That I can cool off instead. And in fact, that's what the Panna means, is chill, baby, chill.

**Speaker A:** You said Panna?

**Speaker B:** Nibbana.

**Speaker A:** Nibbana, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right, if you want to use it that way, wouldn't put an R in it. Nirvana. Nirvana, just chill baby, just chill out, cool off. In the physical context of the body, relax the body. Relax the body, cool the heart, and keep, let us say, watchful, to keep that system going. By breathing, we understand the body itself, and by understanding the body, we can relax it. By gladdening the mind, we can change the attitude of the mind, as well as change how we feel. But we have to do it over, over, and over, and over. It's very repetitive. Why? Because we've been repeating doing things that we were told and resenting it over, and over, and over again. Instead of enjoying what we're doing, we resent what we're doing. That's why we call it a job. That's why we call it work. We could call it employment. We could call it time off. Yeah, but we don't. We call it work, we try, etc., like that. We're not enjoying it. We could be satisfied instead. Yeah, but we have spent so much time being dissatisfied, working, wanting things that are off into the future. That habit needs to be modified and changed many, many, many, many, many times. Okay, just a little bit at a time, we keep changing it, keep changing, keep changing it, and pretty soon we begin to change that attitude from the loser's attitude into the winner's attitude. I've got satisfied, and I can be satisfied again. I know how to do it. So that's the whole idea of Anapanasati, is to become friends with oneself. And then, we practice that with others. There's a whole language that we have, you know, like Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha, how we're going to handle things with others. Are we going to be friends? Are we going to be political, or we're going to be enemies. So the whole teaching of the Buddha is all about making friends, first on the inside, normally in seclusion, and then we open it a little bit to allow other nobles in, so that we can really cement this thing. And then after we're associating with nobles and know what really high-class humanity really is, then we can go out and share it with others. So Jesus had an expression like, don't feed your pearls to the swine. That means that for a while we keep our nobility to ourselves, right? Anyway. But thank you, Sheriff. And in fact, we want to become available to those who are noble. This is why it's such a good idea to start going to these Thai Wats, yeah, and Asian Wats throughout the United States. That in fact, the Lao, the Cambodian, and especially the Vietnamese Taiwans were established by refugees from the war. They came in the '80s, but the ties were already there, because when the Flyboys left with their new brides, they went back to the military bases, and that's where all the Taiwans sprung up. So, the Taiwans were springing up really early, by 1983. That range of time, '80s, '90s, to where the Asians were, the refugees were into the Reagan administration, deep into the Reagan administration, when finally enough pressure was put on the United States to bring these millions of refugees in. So, a lot of them started rolling in in 1986, in that time period. And nothing much happened with them, because they had it set up that Christian churches would take a group of Asians under their wing and become foster representatives or something like that. And so, it took 5 to 10 years for the Asians to break away from that, so that they could go away from that Christianity and reestablish their their Buddhist temples. And so there was new influx in the middle '90s through the— up until now, of people wanting to build the other Asian ones, the Lao, the Cambodian, and the Vietnamese. And so that's how all of that got started in the United States. But only to a lesser degree in other Western countries, that Buddhism has now sprouted. There's been a wat in Mexico City for more than 20 years. And so, this is the place where Westerners are going to find that Sangha, of getting around people who have been Buddhist from birth. Go eat with the Bhikkhuni, especially the Dhamma. Have fun being in a wholesome environment. This is one of the things that would happen. And over time, the idea then is that with your establishment there and staying around the Asian people and gaining some value, sometime you can make an idea, or maybe somebody there will have the idea of why don't we do a meditation, uh, an hour or two every week for the West, done in English language.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Then the Western community in general, uh, uh, in Tulsa can find out that the wat exists.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now is not the time to invite other people. Now, sure. Go get yourself all mentally cleaned up and polished and everything. Yeah, and go do that is at the Wat. Also, I would invite you to join us on, on the Skype sambhas because we've got some friends here and many of them are experimenting with going to watch. In fact, about 5 of them want to come to the watch here in Thailand. But Matt's been to the watch in Tampa and Orlando, and Scott's been to the watch, and Kishon has met a good monk in Chicago, and Everything is really beginning to percolate. Everything's beginning to bubble up and that kind of stuff. So you're into this at the right time. And so come and become friends with our group of Sangha and call me and we can talk about any questions that you have about the Dharma or whatever. But it sounds like that you're having quite a lot of fun on your own. And I had to praise that. Congratulations, Michael.

**Speaker A:** I've been enjoying it. Yeah, I will say, so I'm not even sure how to pose this question exactly, but like for me, and part of this has actually come from listening to Buddhadasa. He had this one talk called No Religion. I'm sure you've maybe heard of it.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. I've really been sort of feeling that way lately. And like.

**Speaker B:** Well, that book is chocolate box. What way are you talking about?

**Speaker A:** Well, just that, you know, that essentially they're like, there is a Dharma, there is a truth, you know, but it's like, it doesn't necessarily like exist because of the Buddha or because of Jesus or because of, you know, any religion or whatever. It's just that like there's kind of like.

**Speaker B:** Truth is truth. Is that human capable of seeing things the way that they really are?

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker B:** The Buddha actually said that he did not invent or make anything. They merely discovered an old path. And there's a whole quality of what is called a teacher Buddha, which are those who became without talking or teaching, that it's a natural experience. An example of that would be Anicca, modern times, Eckhart Tolle, who just got tired of the message he was making and just sat down on a park bench for a couple years, right? When people started asking him a bunch of questions, he didn't have any answers to them, so he started reading Buddhist books so he would have Buddhist answers.

**Speaker A:** Right? Right.

**Speaker B:** So this is another example, Dan. And, um, actually, I've had conversations with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa about Jesus, especially with all detailed knowledge that we have been digging up about when and who, how Buddhism was transmitted to the Mediterranean area, looking at Alexandria with the Therapeute, and, uh, who was Socrates book storage. Where did they get all that?

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the scenes and, uh, that are all doing ritualized water bathing, which is very typical of, uh, uh, in fact there's a whole lot of stuff about watering holes and bathing areas. And you see so many combinations. It could be the Nāsa keeps the position of Yes, but we don't know. And we do know that it was a Bhikkhuni, an Anagami, just like it was in India.

**Speaker A:** At whatever time. Dhammarato, you're breaking up a little bit. Could you maybe move the mic closer? Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. So Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's position is, is that the Dhamma is the Dhamma, and it will be, um, let us say, identified and understood by those who do and will speak their own native language, right? In fact, in one of the suttas, 139, the Buddha talks about that in the sense of how to teach the Dhamma is that you have You have to teach it in the language of the student. So if you're using new language, you have to introduce the words slowly so that they will understand the words, rather than piling a bunch of foreign language words on them, or other things like this. And so the question that you're asking is there, in the sense that I hear a lot of noise.

**Speaker A:** Are you hearing noise from me? You, you sound fine on my end.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. I turned my microphone off and the noise stopped.

**Speaker A:** I wonder if it's maybe your headphones. Maybe your headphones aren't plugged in properly. That's the only thing I can think of.

**Speaker B:** No, actually, this mic is not associated with the headphone connections on this PC. It's different. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** As soon as I'm quiet, the noise comes back up, so that means it's weird. Skype. Yeah, Skype. Skype is getting that noise. I'll have to take a look at the Skype connection. Uh, yes. Okay. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'm going and doing the audio settings. Audio. That's very interesting. Something's wrong with the microphone now. I'm beginning to think Yeah, I've got Quite a problem here. Oh, okay. Um, very, very noisy.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Uh, well, now it seems to be better. I changed several things, and let's see what happens now.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Um, actually, this is the microphone that I'm using now. How does that sound?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it sounds perfectly fine.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So, actually those are— I don't know what to do about it. So anyway, I can't even hear. All I've got is the roar in here. Is it possibly coming from your end?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can, I can mute.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right now that, that was it. It wasn't here at all. It was on your end, a lot of noise. Turn your microphone back on now.

**Speaker A:** Do you hear it now?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, I wiggled the cable on my microphone a little bit, that might have helped.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a roar that increases in volume.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right now I can hear it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, cool.

**Speaker B:** All right, now the noise comes in again. What you did— now it's off. Now it's on again, getting louder. Now it's off.

**Speaker A:** Now it's on again. Here, let me mess with my mic for a second. One sec. Can you hear me now?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can hear you now, but also when you turn the mic on, the noise started up. Again, so your mic's catching a lot of noise. And it's very late into our talk when that started to happening, so I.

**Speaker A:** Don'T know what's— Yeah, I'm not sure what happened, honestly. Are you still hearing it? I'm guessing.

**Speaker B:** Um, well, one, when one of us is talking, the noise stops. That's an interesting point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Uh, and it starts up in the gaps, and when we let it roll, it gets whittled out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, so let's go ahead and, uh, I've lost my thread with all of this.

**Speaker A:** That's okay.

**Speaker B:** I know where we were going with it, because we were covering the general point about the Triple Gem: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, which has to do with getting one's mind cleaned out and making friends with it, within one's own mind. And then the Sangha, of the other side of the friendship, of dealing with others, in a friendly way, rather than in a political way. So, we come into a state of satisfaction, and then deal with others from a state of satisfaction. So that's basically how it works. And there's a whole process to do that. It's called the Eightfold Noble Path, which I guess we can talk about later, as well as how it fits into Anapanasati. So why don't we finish now?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And you go and practice basically what we've been talking about, because you've been listening to so many of the videos anyway. I think you kind of know what's going on. So I hope to hear from you again soon.

**Speaker A:** —Yeah, of course.

**Speaker B:** —We can go over it all again, as well as get you invited to join the various Sangha groups.

**Speaker A:** —Yeah.

**Speaker B:** —It'D be good to see you on Friday evenings on the US Sangha.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I think the main one I can join is the— I think it's Wednesday UK call. I'm off on that day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, usually. All right, sounds great.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, it was a pleasure talking with you, Dhammarato. I'm excited for our next talk.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** See you later.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a Sangha friend (Speaker A):

### **Core Theme: The Triple Gem and the Importance of Noble Friendship**
The central message revolves around rediscovering the true meaning of the **Triple Gem** (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) for Western practitioners, with a strong emphasis on finding and cultivating **Noble Friendship**.

### **Main Points Discussed:**

1.  **The Western Buddhist Experience:**
    *   Many Westerners come to Buddhism as adults seeking relief from dissatisfaction, often missing the cultural context of born-Buddhist communities.
    *   Western Buddhism has been influenced by a "treasure hunter" mentality rather than being transmitted through noble lineages, leading to misunderstandings (e.g., translating *dukkha* as "suffering" instead of "dissatisfaction").

2.  **The Critical Role of Sangha (Community):**
    *   The real Sangha is the **Sangha of nobles**—those who understand and practice the Dhamma correctly. This is more important than the formal monastic/lay distinction.
    *   True Dhamma practice is **100% about friendship**: first, making friends with oneself (achieving inner unity and peace), and then cultivating noble friendships with others.
    *   **Recommendation:** Western practitioners should connect with **Asian Buddhist temples (Wats)** in their areas. These are vibrant, wholesome communities often overlooked due to language and cultural barriers. Spending time there provides invaluable exposure to born-Buddhist culture.

3.  **The Problem of "Going Along to Get Along":**
    *   A major source of our dissatisfaction is instinctual, monkey-see-monkey-do behavior—conforming to social or familial expectations out of a survival instinct, which leads to resentment.
    *   We operate too much from the "automatic pilot" of instinct and conditioned rules (the superego), rather than from wise, conscious choice (using the "frontal cortex").
    *   **The Solution:** The Buddha's teaching is to **wake up** from this automatic behavior, see the dangers of dissatisfaction, and consciously choose actions that lead to satisfaction and peace.

4.  **Practical Path: From Inner Conflict to Inner Friendship**
    *   The path begins with **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing) to calm the body and mind, stepping out of the "heat" of unwholesome thoughts.
    *   The goal is to **unify the mind**, ending the internal war between different desires and conditioned rules. Signs of a disunified mind include confusion and lying (to oneself or others).
    *   One must repeatedly practice coming to a state of satisfaction and relaxation ("chill out") to rewire the habit of dissatisfaction.

5.  **Historical & Cultural Context:**
    *   Dhammarato provides context on the split in early Buddhism (linking it to King Asoka's time) and how the noble lineage was preserved in Asia.
    *   He also explains the history of Asian temple establishment in the U.S., noting they are ideal places for Westerners to find authentic Sangha.

### **Advice for the Practitioner (Speaker A):**
*   **Continue and deepen practice** at the local Vietnamese temple.
*   **Focus first on personal practice** ("get mentally cleaned up") before actively inviting others.
*   **Join the online Sangha groups** to connect with like-minded practitioners on this path.
*   The ultimate aim is to become a stable, satisfied person who can then be a noble friend to others, spreading Dhamma naturally from a place of contentment rather than politics or proselytizing.

### **Underlying Tone:**
The talk is encouraging and hopeful. Dhammarato praises the student for seeking out a temple and frames his journey as part of a timely, growing movement of Westerners connecting with authentic Sangha to correctly understand the Triple Gem.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and the challenges of Western Buddhist practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Mental Virus:** Dissatisfaction is compared to a "mental virus" passed from parents to children through imprinting.
2.  **Monkey See, Monkey Do:** Used to describe how we unconsciously mimic the dissatisfaction and behaviors of those around us.
3.  **Nesting/Herding Instinct:** Our tendency to go along with the group to belong and survive is likened to the instinctual behavior of animals in a nest or herd. This extends to "mob mentality."
4.  **Automatic Pilot:** The unconscious, instinctual mind is compared to an airplane's autopilot. Wisdom involves taking manual control, especially in "storms" or dangerous situations (strong emotions).
5.  **The Crowd Within:** The mind is described as a divided "crowd" of conflicting voices (rules, desires, instincts), which need to be unified into friendship.
6.  **Gun Barrel:** To explain wisdom and foresight: "I don't know when the gun's going to go off, but you know that you don't want to be standing in front of that gun when it does." It's about seeing the direction of cause and effect.
7.  **Polishing vs. Making Sparks:** Our frantic attempts to fix things (through thinking) are often just "making sparks" and heat. The practice is to "take it off the grinder" and cool down.
8.  **Chill Baby, Chill:** **Nibbana/Nirvana** is metaphorically explained as cooling off, relaxing, and chilling out—the cessation of the "heat" of craving and dissatisfaction.
9.  **Bright Shining System (500 watts):** The vibrant Asian Buddhist temple communities in the West are described as a "bright, shining, happy, wholesome system of about 500 watts that the Westerners don't even know about."
10. **Treasure Hunters vs. Nobles:** Western Buddhism was brought by "treasure hunters" (orientalists, scholars seeking texts) rather than by "nobles" (those practicing the path), leading to a fundamental misunderstanding of the Dhamma.
11. **Feeding Pearls to Swine:** Referencing Jesus, this metaphor advises wisely sharing the refined Dhamma only with those prepared to receive it ("nobles"), not indiscriminately.

### **Stories & Historical Narratives:**

1.  **King Asoka and the Great Schism:** A central story used to explain doctrinal corruption and the split in the Sangha. Asoka's well-intentioned but lavish support attracted many monks who lacked proper training. The "nobles" (true practitioners) called a council, excluding those with wrong views, which led to a jealous counter-council and the split that began Mahayana Buddhism. This story highlights the danger of diluting the teaching and the importance of associating with true "nobles."
2.  **The Half Sutta (Story of Ananda):** The story where Ananda tells the Buddha that "friendship is half of the holy life," and the Buddha corrects him: "Not so, Ananda! Not so! Friendship is the *whole* of the holy life." This underscores the paramount importance of **Sangha** (noble friendship) in the practice.
3.  **The Transmission to the West via Refugees:** A historical narrative explaining how authentic Asian Buddhist communities (**Wats**) were established in the West—first by war brides near military bases, then by refugees in the 80s and 90s breaking away from Christian sponsorship to rebuild their temples. This story points to where "noble" Sangha can be found today.
4.  **Eckhart Tolle as a "Teacher Buddha":** Referenced as a modern example of a *Pacceka Buddha* (a self-enlightened one) who discovered the truth without a teacher, then later studied Buddhism to find language for his experience. This illustrates that truth exists independently of any single religion.

### **Core Conceptual Frameworks Used as Metaphor:**

*   **The Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha):** Used as a lens to diagnose the problem in Western Buddhism: bad translations (Dhamma), no living example (Buddha), and misunderstanding of true community (Sangha).
*   **Paticcasamuppada (Dependent Origination):** Referenced as the deep explanation for why we remain in a "woeful state of being an animal" driven by instinct.
*   **The Eightfold Path & Anapanasati:** Framed as the practical method to "come to our senses," cool the mind, and transform our attitude from a "loser's attitude" to a "winner's attitude" of satisfaction.

**In summary,** the speaker uses metaphors from modern life (autopilot, virus, gun barrel), animal behavior (monkey, herd), and common experience (polishing, heat) to make abstract Buddhist principles tangible. The stories of Asoka and Ananda provide historical and scriptural weight to his points about the critical importance of authentic practice, correct understanding, and noble friendship over religious politics and dogma.
