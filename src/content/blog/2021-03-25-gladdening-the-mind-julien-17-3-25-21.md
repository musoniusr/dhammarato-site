### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, well, Chirang, it's good to meet you.

**Speaker B:** It's great to meet you.

**Speaker A:** Where are you?

**Speaker B:** I am in Miami right now.

**Speaker A:** In Miami, okay. Yeah, I have some friends in Orlando and, uh, other parts of Florida, in Tampa and whatnot. But no one that I know of in Miami right now. Okay, so you called to get some instructions about how to practice, I guess would be the way to say it, and that you said that you practiced two things in the past. One was that you were practicing deep breathing and controlled breathing, and then you seen on Reddit or on the internet someplace that you're not supposed to control the breath. Okay, let me give you this very beginning first analogy of that, and that is that if you are watching your breath but not having any control over it, just mentally monitoring it, then that would be very much like watching someone else play a video game. Right. And if you are actually there controlling the breath and doing it, that's very much like you've got your hand on the mouse and you're actually doing something, right? Who's going to pay more attention closely to the game, the guy who's playing it or the guy who's just watching?

**Speaker B:** The guy who's playing it.

**Speaker A:** The guy who's playing it, right? Okay. In that regard, We can say that with proper practice of meditation, you've got to have some skin in the game. Okay, okay. But this is not passive. It's not a passive activity. It's an active activity. And yet it is being sold as something passive to do. Some will say noting— oh, you just note, you just note whatever's there. Some will say, oh, it's awareness. You be aware of all of your bad thoughts and they'll melt away. And some will use other language. But basically, this is what has become Western Buddhism. Western Buddhism is a kind of practice that has no skin in the game, but it has a whole lot of desire for outcome. Come. In other words, people won't get something out of meditation. That's why they're doing it, where if they were practicing just relaxing, they'd get more benefit out of it than if they practice what they're calling meditation because of passively wanting something that they don't have. That in fact, this is the point to look at, and that is, is that much of the problems of life that people experience as the problems of life are actually that they want something that they don't have, right? That's, that's it. They've got a job, but they want a job that they don't have. They don't want the job that they do have. They, uh, they live in the house that they live in, but they want another house, right? They drive a particular car, but they want another car. And so on and on it goes. We keep wanting things, and eventually all of these people who want all of these things stumble upon meditation and want that too. And they've heard the benefits of the meditation and they want that. And so they go from wanting and longing to wanting and longing to wanting and longing. And that the real practice of Anapanasati as taught by the Buddha is to get ourselves out of that state of wanting and longing, and that we can do that right away. An example of that is that if you want something and there it is and you take it, you're okay. For instance, you want a drink of water and the water bottle is right there at hand. You just grab the bottle and drink it within 10, 15 seconds, you're satisfied. But now let's suppose that you're thirsty, you want water, and the nearest water, drinkable water, is 1,000 miles from here and you're barefoot. And now what are you going to do? Okay, you see the distinction? Yep. Okay, that's where most meditators are. They want a drink of water, but that water seems so far away with no real way of getting there. And so this is what brings on the struggle. Is because you're not practicing correctly from the very beginning, right? All right, so let's talk about what actual practice is. That in fact, what the Buddha taught was, uh, what we refer to as Anapanasati, and that's the name of the sutta, the Anapanasati Sutta, that, uh, that's part possibly a better word to use because the word meditation refers to something different. And that word has been, let us say, stolen from the Christians and applied to Buddhism because the guys were trying to come up with a word and they didn't know what to use, and so they started calling it meditation. And that's confused everybody. Because really what we're talking about here is when we say Anapanasati, that means basically breathing. And that the Sati, that word is— let us go ahead and say it's wrongly translated as into the word mindfulness. In fact, I never heard of the word mindfulness until I heard about Sati. That's not an English language word. There's a lot of words that we use in English language that are, or at least appear to be English language words, and we have a kind of an idea of what they are. But really, these words were invented to describe Buddhism when in fact the original blurred would have been better. Okay, so Sati— basically what Sati means is to wake up. Now you've heard the expression to wake up and smell the coffee before, I'm sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's basically then what we're really going to practice, because the smelling of the coffee is actually getting into our sensory awareness. We're actually smelling something. Now, as opposed to dreaming about smelling something. And so our sensual awareness and our sensual input is one way to spend mind moment. But another way of spending the mind moment is not being in reality in the senses and being here now, but it's being caught in thought, lost in thinking. And when we're thinking, we're normally always lost in the past or in the future. We're thinking about something that happened yesterday or last year or the year before. Sometimes when we're thinking about it, we like something, and because we like it, we miss it and we want it back again. And sometimes we think about the past and remember something really bad happens, and so we feel bad again. Or sometimes we run across some business that needs to be, uh, or that we think about that business that was left undone. And so now we have to make a future plan to do it. Okay, so this is the dangers of having thoughts that just roll on and on and on, is because no one generally in our culture is taught from childhood that you can take control over the kind of thoughts that you have. And if you don't take control over the kind of thoughts you have, the same kind of thoughts that you've always been having will remain because of habit. So just like the breathing and taking control of the breath, we can also say the same thing is true about the thoughts, that if we don't take control over the thoughts, then the old our system of thoughts will just be there. We're not really paying much attention to it, and this is not much of a meditation. Okay, so again, we have to have some skin in the game, and so we're going to work with two items. One is the breath, and the other one is the thought. Now, to get things started correctly, we have to go back to the original teaching the Buddha, the Buddha had, let us say, a very short phrase for his entire teaching. This is very, very well known. It's a 3-word phrase: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. I've got a favorite phrase that I use in English, and that is the phrase, "Don't worry, be happy," because worry is dukkha and be happy is Dukkha, Nirodha. There's many ways that we can say this. This is the entire teaching of the Buddha, is to see the Dukkha right here, right now, in this present moment, and then come out of it right here, right now, in this present moment. The next present moment may be a tenth or a fifth of a second later. Things happen in the mind pretty fast. And yet most of the way that meditation is practiced is it all— you got to do it for an hour a day, day after day after day, and maybe someday you'll get some benefit. And so the only way that people are going to practice that is by really wanting something that they don't have, and they keep practicing meditation wanting something and wanting it and wanting it and wanting it, and it never comes. Because they're not practicing correctly. But if in fact we seize the breath and we seize the mind, then we can do something with them very quickly. It's like, let us say, a naughty child is running around in the yard and mommy will stand on the porch and watch the child and maybe occasionally tell the child, "You come here, you come Come here. But the child is going to keep out playing in the yard. But if mom goes out into the yard and grabs that kid by the arm, she can pull him into the house, right? We've actually got to do that. We can't call the mind and hope that it will come out of its hindrances and out of its yuck and muck and problems into the wholesome place, back home again. We actually have to go grab the mind and bring it back and put it at home. Now this is actually quite easy to do because the mind moments only last a short period of time. And so naturally we're going to go from one thought to the next, to the next, to the next. So we might as well start being aware to start putting some wholesome thoughts in there. One thought to a next thought to the next thought, so that we can begin to control the mind, and then in fact, in this practice that the Buddha sets out of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, this immediately unpacks to the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. And the First Noble Truth is Dukkha. It does exist. People experience it. It's not magical. It's not God-given.. It's something that people do on their own. We feel bad on our own. We have fear, anxieties, and whatnot like that. But mostly you can see that fear is the basis of all of the feelings, and that basis of fear is based upon self-preservation. It's an instinct that keeps us alive. If you had had no fear your whole life, you'd already be dead by now. Your fear has kept you out of the road. Your fear has stopped you when somebody's yelling at you, don't put your hand in the buzzsaw, right? So our fear has kept us alive, but much of the fear that we have is what you would call a false positive. We go around being afraid at times when there's nothing to fear, right? So we still wind up being fearful. We are very thankful for the fear that's kept us alive, but we're not so interested in the fear that keeps us fearful. Okay, so we need to actually start working on that. And one of the things that we can do then in that regard is to tell ourselves there really is nothing to be afraid of. You can look around the room, there's nothing there in that room to be afraid of. There's no alligators on the floor, you don't have any giant Arahant pythons in the closet. There's no mafia dudes there at the door with their guns. You don't have riot police banging into your house. Things are very— in this particular moment, things are safe. Who knows about what the future is going to be, but right now things are pretty well. And yet most people sit at home and they still have fear even though they're fairly safe. They worked really hard to get a safe house. To live in, and they still don't feel safe. Interesting, huh? So we are a part of this practice, then has to be able to look at the reality, to begin to see what is Dukkha and what is not Dukkha, so that we don't have to go around acting as if things that are not Dukkha are Dukkha, or worse, things that are not Dukkha and we see them as Dukkha. So this takes an investigation, and this investigation is an important point so that we can understand what is the real cause of suffering. Now, this is something that the Buddha is really big on, is cause and effect, and I find that so is now modern physics and science. Science and physics are all built upon the cause and effect relationship, that this causes that. Without this, that doesn't happen. Another way of saying it is you said every fire has a fuel. Fires are known by their fuel. You have a house fire, a car fire, uh, electrical equipment fire, uh, a grass fire, a forest fire, whatever, um fire there is, that fire is known by its fuel. So, offhand, do you know of any fire that burns without any fuel?

**Speaker B:** Do I know any fire that burns without fuel?

**Speaker A:** Do you know any fires that burn without fuel? There's quite a lot of them that are

**Speaker B:** famous. A candle, for example.

**Speaker A:** No, the candle has the wax of that it burns. It burns. You notice that as the candle burns over time, the wax melts and is burned down, right? I'm not thinking. All right, let me give you some examples of fires that burn without fuel. Ghosts. You're frozen. Hello? Oh, you're coming back.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I think I lost you for a second.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the internet's good here. So, I was about to say that one fire that burns without a fuel— you still seem to be

**Speaker B:** stuck. Sorry, I think I'm losing you.

**Speaker A:** Turn your camera on and off. Down at the bottom, there's a white deal, uh, white, white, black, uh, the middle white one. Turn your camera on and off.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm sorry, I think I'm— your,

**Speaker A:** your, uh, your screen is frozen. Oh, that's right, you're on a cell phone, so


### Summary

This is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a student (Speaker B):

**Core Theme:** Correcting common misunderstandings about meditation (Anapanasati) and presenting a practical, active approach to ending suffering (*dukkha*) in the present moment.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Active vs. Passive Practice:** Dhammarato strongly criticizes "Western Buddhism" as a passive practice of mere observation or noting. He uses the analogy of playing a video game vs. watching someone else play. True practice requires "skin in the game"—actively engaging with and guiding the breath and mind, not just watching them.

2.  **The Problem of "Wanting":** The root of much suffering is the constant desire for things we don't have (a better job, house, or even meditation results). This turns meditation into another object of longing, placing the "water" of peace far away. Correct practice aims to end this state of wanting immediately.

3.  **Redefining Key Terms:**
    *   **Meditation:** A misleading term borrowed from Christianity. The accurate term is **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing).
    *   **Sati (Mindfulness):** Not passive awareness, but **"waking up"** to sensory reality (like "smelling the coffee") versus being lost in thought about the past or future.

4.  **The Core Method: Seize the Mind & Breath:** Just as a parent must actively take a child by the arm to bring them inside, we must actively "grab" the mind and breath to guide them to a wholesome state. This involves:
    *   **Controlling the breath** to foster deep attention.
    *   **Controlling thoughts** by intentionally replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, breaking habitual thinking patterns.

5.  **The Essence of the Teaching:** The Buddha's entire teaching is summarized in the three-word formula: **Dukkha, Dukkha Nirodha** ("suffering, the cessation of suffering"). This can be practiced **right now**—seeing suffering in this moment and ceasing it in the next. This immediacy is contrasted with the common view of meditation as a long-term grind for future benefits.

6.  **Investigating Fear & Cause/Effect:** Much of our suffering stems from "false positive" fear—being afraid when there is no immediate danger. The practice involves investigating reality to see what is truly suffering and what is not. Dhammarato emphasizes the Buddha's focus on **cause and effect**: every "fire" (suffering) has a "fuel" (cause). Understanding this allows us to remove the fuel and extinguish the suffering.

**Overall Message:** Authentic practice is an active, present-moment engagement where you take charge of your breath and thoughts to directly uproot the craving and fear that cause suffering. It is not a passive waiting game for future enlightenment, but a series of immediate interventions based on the principle of cause and effect.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the speaker uses several metaphors and stories to explain their perspective on meditation practice. Here are the key ones:

### Metaphors

1.  **Video Game Controller:** This is the primary metaphor.
    *   **Watching the breath without control** is compared to **watching someone else play a video game** (passive observation).
    *   **Actively controlling the breath** is compared to **having your hand on the mouse/controller and playing the game yourself** (active participation). This leads to the conclusion that you must have "skin in the game."

2.  **Skin in the Game:** This idiom is used repeatedly to emphasize that proper practice is **active, not passive**. It requires direct involvement and effort, not just passive observation or longing for results.

3.  **The Thirsty Person and Water:** This metaphor illustrates the problem of desire in meditation.
    *   **Correct practice/satisfaction** is like wanting water and having the bottle right next to you—you can satisfy the need immediately.
    *   **Incorrect practice/struggle** is like wanting water but the nearest source is **1,000 miles away and you're barefoot**. The desire is present, but the means to fulfill it seem impossibly out of reach, creating frustration.

4.  **The Naughty Child and the Parent:** This metaphor is for controlling the mind.
    *   The undisciplined mind is like a **naughty child running around in the yard**.
    *   Passively calling the mind (like a parent standing on the porch) is ineffective.
    *   Correct practice is like the parent **going into the yard, grabbing the child by the arm, and bringing them inside**. You must actively seize and guide the mind back to a wholesome state.

5.  **Fire and Fuel:** This metaphor explains the Buddhist concept of cause and effect (specifically regarding *dukkha*, or suffering).
    *   **Every fire is known by its fuel** (house fire, forest fire, etc.).
    *   The point is that **all suffering (*dukkha*) has a cause** (its "fuel"). The practice involves identifying and removing that fuel. The speaker hints that some "fires" (like suffering) are thought to burn without fuel, but implies this is an illusion (like "ghost fires").

### Stories & Analogies

1.  **The Story of "Western Buddhism":** The speaker narrates a critique of how meditation is often taught and practiced in the West. They describe it as a **passive activity sold to people full of desire**—people who want a better job, house, car, and then "stumble upon meditation and want that too." This creates a cycle of "wanting and longing" that the true practice is meant to end.

2.  **The "Don't Worry, Be Happy" Analogy:** The speaker maps the famous song phrase onto the core Buddhist teaching:
    *   **"Don't worry"** = *Dukkha Nirodha* (the cessation of suffering).
    *   **"Be happy"** = The state free from that suffering.
    This simplifies the Buddha's core teaching of the **Four Noble Truths** (*Dukkha*, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation).

3.  **The Safe House:** This is a short, illustrative scenario to point out irrational fear. The speaker notes that people work hard to get a safe house, but often **still feel fear inside it**, even when there is no immediate threat (no alligators, pythons, or mafia). This story highlights how much fear is a "false positive" and a self-generated component of *dukkha*.

### Summary of Key Themes Through Metaphors:
*   **Active vs. Passive:** Video game, skin in the game, naughty child.
*   **Desire & Frustration:** The thirsty person far from water, the critique of "Western Buddhism."
*   **Mind Control:** The naughty child, the need to "seize" the breath and mind.
*   **Cause and Effect:** Fire and fuel.
*   **Recognizing Suffering & Safety:** The safe house story, "Don't Worry, Be Happy."
