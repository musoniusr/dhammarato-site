### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There we go.

**Speaker B:** Um, so we had just been started to talk about, let us call it, other meditation, and that the point that I'm kind of making is that, uh, the other kinds of meditation practices are not actually other kinds of meditation practices. Everybody's practicing Samadhi, they're just leaving a few pieces missing. It's sort of like having a car and they take out the back seat, take out the window glass, they take out the engine, and pretty soon they've got their vehicle, except it's not going anywhere.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Uh, but when we add all of the things back in, all the skills that are added to it— and also these skills, almost all of the skills can be developed other places. So let's talk about skills and what skills that need to be developed. Uh, the Buddha starts off with the skill of right view. And when we say view, we're not talking about a noun like a viewpoint. Yeah, view, an attitude. We're talking about looking, investigate, taking in data over and over And when do we do that? When we remember to. So now we've got the two main skills: whenever you remember to book, book. Now, this is actually two skills that are necessary for martial arts. Yeah, but in a context, not remembering all the time, but only remembering that you're in the ring and that there's danger and you've got to wake up and watch what you're doing. But if you're in the boxing ring, say, well, I think the rounds last for about 2 minutes, and then the really big prize fights are 15 rounds. So altogether in that whole match, there's like 30 minutes of mindfulness. That's all that's necessary. But if you don't have mindfulness, you're going to lose that bout. You're going to get hit in the face every time you're not looking. Okay, so that's one of the places that martial arts and those who practice martial arts are already developing a skill that they can now apply to Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** And then the next one remembering and then looking. Also, looking itself is a skill. Now, in martial arts, that looking would have to do also with the quality of response or reaction time, where the skill of looking and being here now with Anapanasati also has the quality of developing discrimination. Just like in prize fighting or in martial arts, the difference between a blow that lands home and does its job, a knockout punch, is different than the punches that 5-year-olds give each other. And so that's also the quality of the discernment of recognizing what kind of thoughts that we have are knockout punches and what kind of punches don't matter, don't mean anything.

**Speaker A:** That's something I've been noticing a lot over the past couple weeks since I've been doing the practices that I see you recommending for beginners. Just being able to discern how much easier— like, A, how much more enjoyable and easier meditation is when you're you're actually putting some wholesome thoughts in there and just watching for the hindrances as the center, you know, with the breath. Not because a lot of the other meditation advice I've been given and programs I followed, like you say, it's very— it's like concentration-based. It's not necessarily Samadhi-based. It's concentration, and there's a little preamble about the hindrances, but they're not treated as something that's like you're gonna sit here and get the breath going, control it a bit, and just find the hindrances and just get them out of there. And so there's been some discernment just seeing how effective that is. Just from doing it, it's obvious how well that works.

**Speaker B:** The two major places where you find it practiced incorrectly is one under the label of noting and the other one is under the label of choiceless awareness, which is more Vajrayana. Now, the point about choiceless awareness is correct, and the point about noting is correct. It's just not— The problem with the choiceless awareness is that the student is taught to be choiceless aware of what's going on outside. Yeah, you're gone from survival, so what, right? So that's the kind of way that they're looking at it. But in fact, choiceless awareness is very, very much then like, uh, the noting method of Mahasi, in the sense The noting method is to note what's going on on the inside, but not doing anything about it, just noting. Yeah, this is the practice. In fact, note it, note it deeply, note it well, keep noting and noting some more, and when you get finished with that, start again and note some more. Okay, and the question always arises: noting what? And the answer to that is noting whatever is there, which is also so far so good with the teaching of the Buddha. Sure, they're missing both sides. Is missing right effort. Right effort is one of the major parts of the path. It's missing in choiceless awareness because you're not making any choices, you're not doing anything.

**Speaker A:** That was something, that was something I became aware of. This was years ago. I was reading, um, Thanha Saro's, you know, he has a lot of content online, and he had this, this one talk. He was like, he was like, grab the breath and make it like how you want to make it. If you want a deep breath, take a nice deep breath and enjoy it. Don't just sit back and, and, and just watch it. Like, actually do something with it that you think would be useful. And there was something in, you know, what he said that makes a lot of sense in terms of having the discernment to know what to do and actually just doing it, rather than just sitting in the meditation and just, and just watching things kind of happen. Actually being able to guide the mind into doing something like you would if you were practicing an instrument, you know, you actually try to execute some kind of technique and train it. And so I really resonated with that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So actually, you bringing up music, that's another kind of skill that is very useful in the Anapanasati. One of the biggest qualities of music is repetition. And repetition of the music itself, as well as the repetition of the practice, to do it over and over and over and over again. And that we can actually understand that repeating something, or doing it over and over and over again, can in some strange ways be considered concentration. But most people don't think of concentration that way, of just doing the same little thing over and over and over again, which would be basically the way that the child who was doing his homework could do it. It's just do one problem and then do another and then do another and then do another, have some fun and do another, like that. But when the parents or the teacher says, "Do your homework, concentrate," Now the child has to struggle with each one of the examples or each one of the puzzles. He's supposed to add something to the doing of the example.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly what happens with concentration.

**Speaker B:** Right. So concentration has the quality of struggle, and Anapanasati has the quality of seeing the struggle and removing it, because we've gotten them quite— we've already built up in our society the habit of struggling, especially when they don't feel like they can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So what we do then, instead of actually doing it happily, easily, joyfully, we struggle at it and fail. But by struggling and failing, then we get the higher-ups' mercy, grace, and forgiveness, because look how hard we tried. So we get the consolation prize. Now, this actually is the entire basis of Christianity. Yeah, this is 99% of Christianity, is that, okay, you're a sinner, 'Go and stop sinning, but I know you can't do it, so come and confess, and then go and sin some more. And when you're dead, God will give you— because you did confess and did screw up, but you worked hard at not screwing up and did it anyway— now you're going to get forgiveness and get into heaven.' That's the funny thing. No one in heaven that dies— I mean, Christians especially— Christians seem to think that they're the ones that are in heaven. And yet, all of the people who were in heaven under that example of Christianity would be failures. That heaven is, let us say, a collection of thieves, pickpockets, rapists, preachers with their hand in the panties and in the till, and that's who you're going to have to put up with if you get into heaven. Because they're still going to do it, but they're going to get forgiven for it when they're in heaven. The only difference in between heaven and hell is that heaven you get forgiven for being bad, and in hell you don't.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so this is how that whole system is set up, and Back to the point about the noting system, of the noting, is that it's almost the same thing that you're supposed to note and struggle and work hard at noting, but you don't ever come out of the sin, even though that's true. This is kind of interesting, the way that it's built into these 16 stages of insight. I think you might have heard about that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm quite familiar with the stages of insight.

**Speaker B:** So the 16 stages of insight, there is stage 11, which is remarkable, and that's the one of the redoubling of the effort. Finally, they're going to put some effort.

**Speaker A:** In after the whole emotion, all of.

**Speaker B:** The dark night of the soul and all of that. And they're so disgusted with the way that they're doing it, finally they're going to take the effort to practice the Eightfold Noble path and the Four Noble Truths, which is Step 12. And so what I try to do with the students is let's start off with Step 11. Let's go right in and get ready for and go right into the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. That's what the Buddha teaches. He does not teach despair and fear and misery and disgust. That's actually what happens when people are not practicing correctly.

**Speaker A:** Well, and it makes sense that it would happen if you don't know how to get the hindrance out of the mind. You know, you're going to have like the stages of insight has an explosive experience that's positive and then a huge dropping off. But if you don't know how to get the hindrances out of the mind and build some Piti and Sukkha, then of course there's going to be this super low value if you don't have the skill set to stop it. And to me, It just seems crazy to not teach people that now, uh, because I've, you know, I've been in those states before and saw it.

**Speaker B:** It's not so much crazy that the teachers don't do it, it's that the ignorance— the teachers that are out there teaching are ignorant of the actual teachings.

**Speaker A:** And to be fair to the, um, the whole Mahasi tradition, like, I studied with the Mahasis monk at a Mahasi Center in Vancouver. And my experience with them was much different than what I hear about people talking about noting online. The monk that I worked with was much more tender and calm. And I even asked him point blank, what do you do if someone's having these hard experiences? And he just says, you just stop doing that practice because it's causing issues. And so he was a lot more, I would say, level-headed about it. But some of the other people that I've the Western advice online is more like, no, just note through, like it's concrete wall and you just got to note through it. And that was not the advice I got from the Mahasi Center, but that's the advice, you know, again, that you often see online from people that are practicing noting. So I thought that was interesting to note.

**Speaker B:** It sounds like that you've run across a monk that had gone through that and had gotten finally to the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. It's also an interesting point that step 16 of that 16 stages of insight is basically the statement, "Never mind, start again," but it's raised in the sense of continuing ongoing investigation. Ongoing investigation. Okay, well, why couldn't we start that ongoing investigation right from the very beginning? That's the problem with this 16 stages of insight, or 16-step insight, is that they should not be seen as steps and stages. They should be seen as perhaps items. But we couldn't even say items on the list because then we take the list in this order.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly, which is what happens with other, you know, there's like Chuladasa's concentration stages, the same stuff happens to people. It's like, you know, they get kind of hung up on the sequential order of things.

**Speaker B:** So if there actually is an order for the 16 stages of insight, I'd start with number 16, then go to number 11, and then 12. And that would be the 16th. It's number 16, number 11, and number 12. You can forget about most of that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So getting back to the idea of the skills that we have to develop, we've talked about, or began to talk about, 3 of them, which is the skill of— remember, the skill of waking up. Skill of coming back to the present moment to get out of our daydreaming. It's sort of like the wake-up call is when the teacher is standing at the front of the class and all of a sudden she beats them with a stick or something to make some noise. And then she screams at Johnny in the back of the room, Johnny, stop daydreaming and pay attention. Okay. That's his Sati, wake up. Pay attention to what's going on in the classroom rather than daydream.

**Speaker A:** You know, I found like one thing I really wanted to talk about at some point today was I found that, you know, humor is very useful for doing this. And these stories, you know, they're very useful because they're fun, right? So like when you wake yourself up, when you have the Sati with the right view and the right effort online, I found that, you know, the humorous letting go of the hindrances, it works so well. Like it works well and it's fun and it feels good, but.

**Speaker B:** Rather than.

**Speaker A:** Everything, like it's playful rather than it being like really intense and serious, you know. It's like you're doing the right work but it's playful. And so it's aimed in the right direction, but it can be done with a certain kind of spirit.

**Speaker B:** You could go so far as to say that the playfulness comes with the attitude and the result of success. To where heavy-duty concentration and working is based upon the expectations of failure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that it's going to be a tough slog. You got to beat your head against the wall, not recognizing that not only is your head beating against the wall, the wall is also your head. It is your wall.

**Speaker A:** And it kind of— I mean, people kind of talk themselves into the hindrances being harder to deal with than they actually even are any moment by making it into this big thing that's going to require all this, you know, this superhuman type of effort.

**Speaker B:** Anicca is a hindrance. They don't see that.

**Speaker A:** It's so silly.

**Speaker B:** And that in fact, that's one of the— I would say if there is a key word anywhere in the sutras, just one word sitting someplace buried in some sutra or another, I would say that that one word that is a key word to this whole practice is the word that's translated into English of gladdening, to gladden the mind or to brighten the mind, because there's nothing of that in either the Vajrayana or the choiceless awareness or the noting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I agree.

**Speaker B:** They don't have that quality of taking the right effort to gladden the mind.

**Speaker A:** I wasn't taught that in the Zen tradition. I wasn't taught to do that either, right? I mean, there's a lot of great skills I picked up there, there's no doubt, but that one skill missing is— it's a game changer, you know? Really, that's right. I mean, even just my daily life is way more enjoyable since I've been practicing like this.

**Speaker B:** In the Anapanasati Sutta, the gladdening of the mind is listed as "thus one trains oneself," is what is stated, which means that this is a skill to be developed. While mindfully breathing in long and mindfully breathing out long, one develops the skill of gladdening the mind. That's actually the way that it's phrased in the sutta. And that this is the quality. So, the right effort of gladdening the mind is exactly the same as the right effort to change the unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. And that's what's missing in the Mahasi and is missing in the Vajrayana. But I'm not really sure, in fact, that it's missing in Mahasi Samadhi's method, is missing in, by and large, the Western Buddhism version of Maharshi's method.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a really interesting point because, you know, I've heard you talk about that. I heard you talk about that with other students and with Daniel Ingram. My own experience studying with a monk that was from the Burmese tradition, he studied with Saddha, um, was that he was very joyful and very tender and playful, and it was infectious when you're around him. But, you know, for a Westerner, like, you know, he already has that online. So maybe for him when he does noting, he already has this wholesomeness online while he's doing the noting. But for Westerners who are studying with him, that might not be the case. I mean, There's tons of analogies you could draw with that, but it'd be like a musician already having good rhythm, and then they come for piano lessons and you start teaching them, and they don't really need to do the rhythm exercises because they have that stuff.

**Speaker B:** You're right, exactly correct. So I'm reminded of the conversation that I had with Steve Gruberweiken Steve James and Daniel Ingram were— we were talking about the Mahasi Method. We actually did a— yeah, I watched that.

**Speaker A:** I watched that a little while ago.

**Speaker B:** And what Dan did in that was he did his diligent research and he brought up a passage from Mahasi on joy. And I said, I already knew that, but In fact, the way that I stated it is, well, we're done here then. We've just made the point that Dan and I completely agree that that's what's missing in the modern version of the Mahasi Method is the gladdening of the mind and the joy. And that in some of the Burmese traditions, that's true, but it seems like that Where things got kind of shifted or turned was when Mahasi, after he died, Upandita took over, and he was then the primary show and the primary exporter of the Mahasi tradition. And it was he that made things really, really tough.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, I recall this. You know, it almost reminds me of like, I— this is why I think it's important to study the Dharma with a teacher and not just read, because like, I mean, I have music books that I've read, but I know the professor who wrote them, and I know there's a ton of stuff they left out of that book. And someone who hadn't studied with that, that musician and just read the book, they're missing all these little details of how it's strung together. And I mean, maybe that's what's happening with with how noting has come to the West and it's very big online. But yeah, I mean, that's probably something like that, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, we can go down that thread, but let's for at least a little while, let's continue on with this issue of the skills. What skills do we need in skill development? We've covered 3 of them. The fourth one then is after we get a practice going of right looking, remembering to look and remembering and then taking the effort to change the mind from what was there. And when we talk about that, I can say it this way, whatever thought that we're having in this particular moment could be improved. Whatever thought that we've got, it could be improved. And in that regard, we can send, all right, well, let's look at it from that way. Whatever thoughts that I'm having right now, we can make a slight improvement. An example of that is, oh, the wife wants to buy land. Oh, poor me, where's the money coming from? She wants to buy land and I don't.

**Speaker A:** I think we share that story.

**Speaker B:** Well, we can change that into, well, we can afford the land. I mean, if that's what she wants, we can do that. Okay, so that's the way that we can begin to change our thoughts. Well, maybe it'll work out, maybe it'll be okay. And so we can begin to change all of the negative thoughts like.

**Speaker A:** Uh.

**Speaker B:** Um, I'm The Democrats, for instance, have just lost a primary or something like that. And the negative thought says, oh no, things are terrible, we're going to have a terrible election come November. And the correct answer to that would be, instead of that, we can say, well, now we've got something to do. Now we know where the weak spots are and we can go take care of it. So there's always ways of flattening the mind and making the change to it. But if you do just the noting, it's going to spiral down, down, down into fear, misery, disgust, despair, and a strong determination to get out of it, which is steps 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Okay, so all of that will be eliminated simply by that quality of gladdening the mind and bringing the mind back. So now that we've got those three things going, then the fourth one is added according to the Vinaya and Sutra number 117. The fourth ingredient that's added is Samma Sanghappa.

**Speaker A:** The attitude.

**Speaker B:** The attitude, right. Now in Bhikkhu Bodhisattva's version translation. He uses the word thought here, but a better word would be right intention. You know, that second one, that's what.

**Speaker A:** I had heard before, right intention, right?

**Speaker B:** And intention has also to do with that attitude or that expectation, rather.

**Speaker A:** Um.

**Speaker B:** An actual verbal discursive thought. That the verbal of thoughts that we have, uh, we can start off with that, but after a while we begin to actually look at and start changing our attitude about things. And that comes about with success.

**Speaker A:** I felt that start starting to happen. Um, yeah, you can feel, you can feel the attitude like from bottom up, like top down you can, you can change the thoughts, but then after a while you just feel the attitude bottom up changes and it like, it, it just pulls you in that direction, um, even stronger. Like you really feel it. Like, you know, I was just laying, I was laying in the living room last night, did a bunch of practice yesterday, and there, there's this little screensaver on my TV with these flashing colors And I was just sitting there like, this is pretty nice, you know, everything's great, everything looks beautiful, like a nice little screensaver on my TV, like, you know, everyone's fed, like life is great. But, you know, it was more like it was really felt, like it was strong, and it was the attitude was, you know, anything could happen, this would be fine.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Okay, so that's, that was the fourth skill. That comes through development of the other three. The other three run in circle around each other, it's stated, and then we add this fourth one, the Samma Sanghappa, which is the right attitude. And that is based upon the confidence of having been successful at being able to wake up, take a look, and gladden the mind. Wake up, take a look, and gladden the mind. And now you've gotten the mind gladdened, and you feel successful at that. So now you wake up, gladden the mind, look at what you're doing, gladden the mind, and then kind of in a way— I know that some Buddhists would not like that— but take credit for it in the sense of acknowledging the success.

**Speaker A:** It feels more like— it doesn't— like, it feels more like like the success was positive, but it's like, well, now I know what to do. Now I know what actually works to make that happen. Doesn't feel like— doesn't feel like I'm like such a good person for having done it or anything like that. It just feels good. And it's like, well, now I know how to do it. Like, this is great.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So right. It is not my— what a good boy am I?

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, no.

**Speaker B:** Wow, this is the way to do it. This works.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and something interesting, you know, I heard you talk about this and I've been experiencing this. Now it doesn't seem like hindrances won't ever come back, but now there's just like an honest, well, now I know what to do, this is great. Like, there's no problem if the hindrances come back, boom, boom, boom, you know, I have a few little things I do, this is great.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly correct. And then there is one more step to that. And that is that not that we have the general idea that hindrances, yes, I can handle them, but the next step on that is it does not matter how heavy or deep those hindrances are, I can throw them out and come back to this present moment. That is actually what the Buddha calls the first step of the Noble Path, is that knowledge of being such a winner that it does not matter what kind of crap comes by, we've got it wired. That is real confidence, okay? This is the Anagami, and that the example that we have is that the Buddha was known to be a lion, to be a bull. And some of the suttas say things like, it does not matter what kind of assembly he is in, He can walk into a bar, he can walk into a court office, a courtroom, he can walk into a political gathering, he can walk into the gods in heaven, and wherever he goes, he's the center of attention. Anywhere he goes, all the people's attention will turn to him. Okay, there have been many people like that in the past. Some of them are healthy and wholesome and some of them not. One example would be Rasputin, a particular politician, to where the other kind of politician like Trump is when people see him, they don't gravitate towards him. Well, some do, but most people run.

**Speaker A:** I'd be running.

**Speaker B:** But, and so we can think of it. In that way, that the lion, the one who is so self-secured and so confident that people will gravitate towards that. And so this is why he's a lion, and we should practice that. This is a practice, the practice of being a lion, the practice of being in charge, the practice of being the one who knows what's going on. This is the Samma Sanghappa. It is full-on attitude, and it can be developed into a kind of supreme position. And you will hear people talk about that in the sense of, "I am God." Well, you have to define God in a certain way, but if you define it correctly, then I'm God. I'm the boss here. This chair is going to sit right here on the floor, and I'm not going to let it float off into the air. I'm going to sit on it. Okay, so this is the way that we look at it, that we can handle anything. And that's— and we start with that by changing the thoughts that we have that are defeatist thoughts, thoughts of difficulty. Into thoughts of ease. And when things are really, really easy, that means that you've got it wired. You, you could, you could do this. That, that's, that's the attitude that we build up. Okay, so as we're building up those four skills, we also start developing some other skills, and those skills are in, uh, listed in the Anapanasati Sutta. So we We take the development of these four skills that we have from the Eightfold Noble Path and bring them then into the practice of Anapanasati in the sense of waking up and investigating the mind to step 9, and step 10 would be then the gladdening the mind. But now we're going to be working in some other areas, and that is that instead of just talking to ourselves We're actually going to start working with the way that we feel. This is where the Vedana comes in. And in fact, the way to talk about it correctly would be that as we're beginning to change the mind, the way that we do that is by using the body in the sense of watching the body breathe, becoming aware of the sensory input. You've known that in Buddhism we think of it as 6 senses, 6 of them. The mind is one of them, and that's where we tend to spend far too much time, except the only input for that mind is old data, the past. Jump to where the input for the eyes and the ears is present data. So if we are coming out of the past and out of the future, we're actually coming out of the mind and the sense organ of the mind into the other senses of the body—the eyes, the ear, especially the touch—because we have gotten so out of touch with touch. And it happens in childhood. Children are extremely kinesthetic-oriented. Any little boo-boo and the child will cry. Any sensation is a strong sensation. All right. But as we learn to grow up, part of what we do is begin to stop thinking about the body. In other words, when a child is learning to walk, they're always in the danger of falling down, and they're mindful of that. But once we get the skill of walking developed, we stop even thinking about walking. We just walk without even thinking about it. We let it be done by motor skills. That we do need these motor skills, because if we had to think our way through every movement that we made, we wouldn't be doing very much. In fact, the old joke is that one of the animals in the forest saw the centipede So he goes up to the centipede and says, wow, I've only got 4 legs here and I know how to use them. But you're a centipede, you've got 100 legs. How in the world can you walk with 100 legs? And the centipede thought a minute, and then he lifted this leg and he moved that one back and forth, and then he fell over. And then he says, as he had fallen over, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** That's what happens to piano players. That's what happens if you ask a musician, how do you play that? They'll start screwing up, but you know, they start overthinking it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. If you ask the musician how he played that passage, he'll start overthinking it and he'll screw it up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if that's the case, then as we are young people, we spin less and less attention to the body at all. We don't watch the breathing, we don't watch our hands, we don't watch our postures, we don't watch much of anything because we're very outward and past and future oriented. So we're even thinking about something— which.

**Speaker A:** Is like what you were saying before. If you have some other life skill like martial arts that's forcing you to pay attention to the body and you've been working with that, it makes sense that you could bring that to the meditation practice, because it's not like meditation is a bunch of skills that have nothing to do with the rest of your mind. It's just they're not often trained very well outside of the meditation, but some of them could be.

**Speaker B:** Well, there are side skills that are developed. An example of the side skill of walking meditation is that people begin to start walking very quietly. They don't stomp around and make a lot of noise the way that most people do. We also are more familiar with walking barefoot rather than in shoes, and shoes make a lot of noise. So that's one of the qualities that— in fact, it's the quality of silence that gives rise to the idea that monks can fly, because how in the world did he get right over my shoulder But I didn't have a clue about him coming into the room because he didn't make a lot of commotion coming in the room, and you weren't paying attention to your body anyway. If you had been alert to your body, your body would have told you that someone is walking up behind you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've done a lot of walking meditation over the past 7 years, and it's hard for me to think of how normal walking is different. But, you know, when I'm just walking down the street now, it's very difficult to not be mindful of the walking. Like, even if I'm listening to music or listening to a talk, you know, the feet are in my awareness. They never, like, disappear anymore. That's just the way it is. But it's hard to remember what it was like before, you know, like 10 years ago. I'm assuming I wasn't mindful of it, but I can't precisely think of that.

**Speaker B:** So bodily awareness is a kind of a side benefit of, or a side skill of paying attention to the body, of waking up the body to feel the sensations of the body and the breathing and all of that. So we work with the mind to work with the body, that we cannot take a long deep breath unless, until we remember to take a long deep breath, or the body does it naturally because we're running upstairs or up a hill or something like that. That, and then the body will start to breathe heavily. But if you think about it, you can breathe in a deep, strong, relaxed way. Okay, so in that regard, we can now see that we use the body and the mind together. We're going to take them as kind of a pincer movement to get to the heart the real difficult one, which is the Vedana, to learn to control our feelings. Very, very few people will boast about the fact that they are capable of managing their feelings. Almost everyone speaks in language that indicates otherwise. An example of that, when somebody says, "I'm angry," or, "I'm frustrated," that means that the anger is so big that it's encompassed me, whoever I am. Okay, so I am angry is different from, aha, I see the anger. I am not the anger, I'm the observer of the anger.

**Speaker A:** So this topic is something I wanted to talk to you about, about being able to influence/control feelings is something that the message you get in the West, because it's very— for Western meditators, is very much this mentality of we shouldn't control emotions because that'll suppress them somehow. We should just stand back and watch them and let them take their course. And even the other day I was in another Dharma group, not one of your groups. I won't name the teacher just out of some respect, but the whole mentality in the group was that, you know, you can't influence your emotions. And it's really interesting hearing that now after practicing.

**Speaker B:** Well, they can't because they don't know how. They don't have the skill.

**Speaker A:** But there's the mindset's even deeper than I don't have the skill. The mindset almost is it's dangerous to try because it's going to cause some kind of chaotic explosion. We have to just kind of take it and sit back. And after practicing like this for a couple weeks, I'm like, this is crazy because, you know, I've been meditating for a decent amount of time, not as long as many, a lot of people, but, you know, 7 years pretty seriously. It would have been useful to know this earlier, you know, because I'm having a great time.

**Speaker B:** No doubt you've heard of the Esop's Fable of the Fox and the Grapes.

**Speaker A:** You might. Maybe tell it to me again because the whole thing's not coming to mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the grapes were high up on the bush. These were not low.

**Speaker A:** Oh, is this the sour grapes? Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So the fox is jumping and jumping and jumping and he can't get it. And so finally he won't Saray, saying all the grapes were sour already anyway. So that's what happens with a lot of meditation practices, is that they say that, oh, it's sour anyway, I should not try to control the feelings simply because I can't. But if you can't control the feelings, then how are we ever going to come out of our anger? How are we ever going to come out of our Anicca? To come out of our greed and our ill will, which is the source of suffering. So what they're saying is, is that by saying you can't change your feeling, they're saying basically what the Christians say: you're stopped, you're stuck, you've got an original sin, you've got an albatross, and you're going to have to deal with a God or something, because you can't fix it.

**Speaker A:** And it also leaves aside this whole notion that's in just all the Buddhist literature of things happen based on causes. So if you have a negative emotion, there's a cause to that and you can do something about it to change it. That's the whole game, is it not?

**Speaker B:** Right. That's a major distinction between the teaching of the Buddha and the old Hindu. They had the idea of the Kamma in the sense of the cause and effect. Causes this effect that we're having right now happened a long time ago, and you can't do nothing about it because it happened so long time ago. To the point of the Buddha is, he said, no, the reason that you're in this situation right now is because of what you just did. The cause and effect were immediate. And then in fact, in the Sutra Number 12, in the line, the The Large Sutta of the Lion's Roar, this is one of the first items on the list, actually is number 2 of what makes a Buddha. The first item on the list is that a Buddha knows what is impossible and what is possible. Breathing is possible. Holding one's breath for days at a time is not possible. You'll die. Okay, so that's an example of it. Now we can think of it like this: you were born, you will live, and you will die. That's possible. Not only is it possible, it's evident. But reincarnation, there is no evidence of that. It's impossible. And when we can see what's possible and what's not possible, then we can begin to see what kind of stories people are telling us are all based lies, because what they're saying is impossible.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I have a very— some of my friends know this, and if they watch this, it'll be funny, but I have a very low tolerance for magical thinking. Like, it's extremely low. It just— and I mean, you know probably more than anyone that the meditation community It's just a circus with this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Because they believe in things that are not possible. Yeah, an example of that: I can sit here in misery and call it meditation, hour after hour, day after day, until I rack up 100,000 hours of misery, and then the Kamma machine is going to come in with the Shaktipat and make me feel blissful. And that's impossible.

**Speaker A:** But that is, I think, the operating assumption, maybe not verbally evident in someone's mind, but it's the operating assumption that's guiding a lot of people's behavior in this sphere. That kind of, you know, I just got to keep playing the lottery until something happens and I'll win the bliss jackpot forever.

**Speaker B:** And the thing that people are beginning to wake up to, and that is that the jackpot pots and these lotteries are rigged. How many— in fact, the Michigan Lottery, they went that way for years because they didn't ever come up with a winning number, so they just added to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** They pulled out the number. Here's the number. Anybody got the number? Sorry about that, we'll keep the money. Yeah, and nobody wins. Nobody wins that lottery. Okay, that's how it is wound up. And so this gives idea in Western Buddhism that always been centuries since anyone's become enlightened.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you said something really interesting on one of the YouTube conversations I listened to, that Westerners think there's very few people that are enlightened, even that are monks. And you were saying in Thailand there's like 400,000 monks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the number that I've heard is 25,000 But I heard that 30 years ago. I don't know how many there are now, but that's basically 25,000 nobles in 25,000 nobles. Yeah, 25,000. I'm not sure whether that was referred to as just nobles or fully enlightened Arahants, but in any case, it's not nearly as unique and is uncommon. You see, that's the thing about Jesus, is that if they had left Jesus as an example for everyone to follow, we'd have a completely different Christianity. But what they did is they put him way high up on a pedestal. Yeah, he's unique. We only have one Jesus at a time, you know. Okay, and we've already had one. Humanity's had their Jesus. Sorry, you've run out. No more Jesus left. He was a unique, special kind of Son of God, without recognizing that we're all sons of God. We're all sons of God. We're also all sons of bitches too. And we don't know that we have a choice. We all think that we're sons of bitches, and that's just it, that we're born into suffering. And that's just it, that we're screwed because we can't change the way that we feel. Now, if we can develop the skills to change the way that we breathe and change the way that we think and change the way that we experience the world, we can also change the way that we feel. Then in fact, we have been changing the way that we feel. We just didn't know it. So the way that I express that is we have been talking ourselves into feeling bad for our whole life. Now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good. This is what those Anagami wholesome thoughts are about, is that they do affect the way that we feel. Which you're, you know, let's say a clear example of that, that you can change the way that you feel.

**Speaker A:** It's, yeah, it's really quite possible. I mean, I've always meditated a lot in the past years, but all I started doing, as I said, let's start from ground zero. Let's just do 10 minutes a day, 5, 6, 7 times a day, who knows, whatever I can fit in. And it's been really nice, you know, because the practice doesn't really feel like it stops between the sits. The Sati is still very frequent.

**Speaker B:** Just— Would you go so far as to say then that your sitting meditation is when you were intentionally, intensely practicing? Practicing remembering.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that you get up off the chair or get off the floor and go about your daily business. You continue to remember. You continue to remember because that's the skill that you're developing, is the skill to remember.

**Speaker A:** And it's interesting, you know, I'm sure everyone's background is different, but, you know, my background of having this piece missing, it makes it feel so good to do. So there's a really good motivation for doing it. It's because my day is a fucking lot better when I do it. And even not just the whole day, but the moment feels better. You know, whatever I'm doing, it's just so self— it almost makes a feedback loop. Like, it's so self-reinforcing to do it. And even when the mind starts to drift and maybe some hindrances come in or distraction or whatever, it's like, oh yeah, I don't have to deal with that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, look at that. I can see that. Exactly. Okay, so in the regard then, now that we're beginning to talk ourselves into feeling good, this is now in the Anapanasati Sutta where the Buddha says, "Mindfully breathing in long, one trains oneself in Sukkha, and mindfully breathing out long, one trains in Sukkha." And then you go to the Pali dictionary and you find out that Sukkha actually has clear definitions. Also, we can see that Sukkha is exactly the opposite of Dukkha, that when you're in a state of Sukkha in that moment, you're not in Dukkha. And yet, within the Western Buddhism, we think that Dukkha, Dukkha everywhere, and it's going to stay there for years, and you're only going to get rid of the Dukkha if you're really, really lucky. That's the kind of way that they phrase it.

**Speaker A:** That is how it's phrased, and even when people talk about the three characteristics, they talk about They talk about no-self and impermanence, which I'm fine generally with the way that's spoken up. But then this Dukkha part is, in the Western tradition, it's often just phrased as like, well, nothing satisfies. That's it. There's not really more of a conversation. But, you know, the way that I'm hearing it from you is that this being satisfied, it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with what's going on. Yeah, things don't satisfy, but you can, you can you can train yourself to be more satisfied. And, and yeah, just again to hammer that home, it's like that message is not what I've been hearing. And I'm very much, you know, read in this Western Buddhist sphere, and it's just not like, hey, just take it a little bit at a time, train to be satisfied, and it, it works.

**Speaker B:** Well, satisfaction has several constituent components. That would, let us say, destroy our satisfaction, or if we didn't have them, or take us back to Dukkha. And that is, by the way, the primary feeling of the human, the primary feeling of all life forms, the primary feeling is the feeling of fear, danger. Because the whole point about being alive is sustaining life, and so we all have a built-in self- preservation instinct, and the language that it speaks is fear.

**Speaker A:** Which is why that feeling of safety.

**Speaker B:** Would be an important— Right, exactly. So even humanity, when we were, let us say, jungle bunnies, when we lived in the jungle, everything was dangerous. And so we start doing things like building houses and building villages and building communities and then building cities in order to feel safe, and yet no one feels safe in a city. That's the interesting thing, that we took the danger with us. And so, if we're feeling in a state of danger, that's not satisfying, that's not satisfying. So we have to come to the state of feeling safe and secure. Well, guess what? The reality is that we are safe and secure right now. There are no alligators, there's no monkeys, there's no crocodiles, there are no mafia bosses. You don't have a boogeyman in your closet. There's not a bear under the bed. You're safe. And we don't give ourselves credit for the fact that right here, right now, we're safe. We start thinking about emails and then we feel insecure because of an email. We feel insecure because of a water bill. We feel insecure because of a comment. I want to buy some land and all of a sudden, oh no. Okay, so, and so just to comment, and people get angry and uptight and upset because of a comment or because of, um, a thought. But the real danger is not there. So paying attention to the reality of the situation and talking to ourselves with thoughts about the reality of the situation is that we are safe right here, right now. Why can't we give ourselves credit for feeling safe and secure? Because almost all of the dangers that anyone has ever had is either going to be in their past or in their future. In fact, some people would go so far as to say that every problem that any particular human being has ever had in their whole life, 99% of those problems didn't ever happen. They didn't materialize. They stayed mental. And here we are developing and thinking about 99 things that could go wrong, when in fact none of them go wrong.

**Speaker A:** This was something I noticed over the past 2 weeks of doing this practice, and and following your videos and material and stuff is just the relationship with time seems different in terms of like you can use time as like I got to meet this guy at 7 o'clock and we'll both be there and that's great. But it doesn't really seem real in the same sense that it was before in terms of, you know, when you're thinking about futuristic problems, they're just kind of— they're just thoughts. They're not— they're nothing. Like, everything's good right now. I'm just sitting in a well-cooled room on a decent chair. I got water. Like, every— in that sense, like, what's actually going on? I got it. Yeah. And, you know, we're okay. Okay, right now we got this technology and we gotta talk, and, you know, everything's pretty good right now.

**Speaker B:** So we don't— we don't pay attention to that kind of stuff. That we're always paying attention to the possibility of what could go wrong. And anything could go wrong.

**Speaker A:** You know, I started kind of experimenting with this, like just watching how thoughts like drive up this fear and this kind of distracting attention. And I just started putting kind of funny thoughts in the head, like there's a unicorn outside that might die if you don't run outside and deal with it right now. And you can just see how ridiculous that is. Like, it doesn't get your body fired up in the same way that a thought that you really are invested in does. But essentially, they're very similar to each other in a certain sense. They're both just, you know, the mind just yapping.

**Speaker B:** Correct. Exactly. So dealing with fear that way, the next item that we can look at is the issue of discomfort. That if you are in physical or bodily discomfort, never mind mental, because that's what we're dealing with, but if the body is not comfortable, then we're not in a state of satisfaction. We need to be in a state where the body is comfortable so that it can relax. That's in fact step 4 of Anapanasati, is to not just become familiar or investigate the body as step 3, but do so with the intention of relaxing the body. And yet you will find things like the Goenka method with the strong determination sitting, which by the way is Burmese too, and people will sit for a long time and their body will become uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** I sat in the Zen tradition, right? It's brutal sometimes. It's really something, not enjoyable for the body.

**Speaker B:** Is not enjoyable for the body, and because it's not enjoyable for the body, it's not enjoyable for the mind, and there is no Sukkha there. It's just more Dukkha. Now we've got bodily Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** And then you wonder why you're not running back for the next retreat the next month, right?

**Speaker B:** No, I know. So having shorter sitting sessions in these retreats would be a good thing to do.

**Speaker A:** I've been really enjoying the shorter sessions. I've been getting very, very calm, very happy. My body feels great, you know. I know I get to do more of them during the day. This is great. Sometimes they go longer if I have time.

**Speaker B:** Well, if the mentality is, is that this is really tough, Nookies, this is tough going, and you're going to have to beat your head against the wall— in that mentality, you said, yeah, and I'm going to have to keep beating my head against the wall for an hour or two. Yeah, because of the quality of endurance. So if we have Sukkha, that means it's got a basis or a foundation of freedom from fear. I wouldn't call it fearlessness because fearlessness has to do with bravery. Or we walk into a dangerous situation. You can see in the old days that someone is putting on his battle armor and battle gear and he's fearlessly going off into battle. That's courage.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah, because you wouldn't even use the term fearless unless there was something to fear.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:D] Right. So, a better way of looking at it is that this same guy, instead of dressing in battle armor to go out to battle, He's actually going to cook dinner, because he's got a guest coming. Why? Because I'm not afraid of the guy at all! You see, he got into battle armor because he was afraid, it was danger. So we have to actually stop getting ourselves ready for battle, and start getting ourselves ready for a dinner guest. Because that's all that we've got. There is nothing to fear. He's my friend, he's not my enemy. So when we begin to have that idea, then we can have that feeling of— that's why I use the word safety and security as opposed to fearless, because we don't practice fearless, we practice being safe and secure. Fearless is something you do in the face of danger, but when we recognize that the danger itself was manufactured, and that there really was no danger in the first place, now we can feel safe and secure. With safety and security and comfort comes— now the real issue is the satisfaction. And these three things together— safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction— are the primary ingredients of Sukkha. That if you have safety, security, comfort and satisfaction, where's your dukkha in that moment? Okay, so this is a skill to be developed, but we're not finished yet because the next part of it is, is that as we practice this safety, security, and satisfaction over and over and over again, we begin to get that attitude, hey, I can do this anytime. It's not just a one-time shot. Now I can do it anytime that I remember to do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I noticed. I noticed it starts just, you know, you end the sit and the attitude feels good, and it's like, well, I'm just going for a walk down the street. I'm not sitting, but there's no reason to stop working on that stuff because it feels nice and the Sati is still there.

**Speaker B:** OK, so now we've got a new skill developed, and that is not just Sukkha, but the attitude of "I can do this," the attitude of "Life is not only worth living, but it's worth living happily." Wow, this is good stuff. That's the Samma Sanghappa, and that's also what we refer to as the Piti. The Piti is the feeling, "I've got it." Now, when we bring the issue of gladdening the mind and throwing the hindrances out, bringing the body into a state of relaxation and comfort, bringing the mind into a state of satisfaction, and the winner's attitude, these are all skills to be developed. And by bringing these skills developed, especially when I add the word applying the mind to the wholesome and sustaining it on the wholesome, applying the mind to the wholesome and sustaining the mind into the wholesome, which eliminates the hindrances, having Sukkha, and then that winner's attitude, the Piti. Now this is a combination of a group of factors that we would call Samadhi and also called the First Jhana. Being able to get into the First Jhana quickly is a new skill to be developed. How can I get— do I have all of these little skills laying around that I could put them together quickly? And that is totally— yeah, but that's.

**Speaker A:** Totally different than, you know, what you hear about the Jhanas from a lot of people. It's a type of concentration attainment. It's a type of like mental focusing on an object attain.

**Speaker B:** No, that's got nothing to do with what we're practicing here. That's just a bad representation, or let us say the bad translation of the word Samadhi. Does not mean concentrate.

**Speaker A:** You know, which is really interesting because I found the same thing in music. It's often very, uh, you know, from teaching music and studying it myself, telling someone to concentrate is almost a completely pointless direction to give them. You would almost— like, if I was trying to get a student to do something, I would just tell them what to do. I'd say, put your finger here and just watch this note going to that note. I wouldn't give them this blanket statement of just concentrate more. It's almost like I don't know what they would do with that information because it's just more stressful.

**Speaker B:** They would struggle and concentrate, which ends up.

**Speaker A:** Like— Yeah, it's really, it's really, uh, interesting, the parallels there.

**Speaker B:** So the example that I was using for mathematics is exactly the same issue with the music. If you tell the child to concentrate, he can't do the mathematics, he's too busy concentrating.

**Speaker A:** If you tell them— it's almost like they just try to start looking like they're concentrating, like they tense the body up so it looks like they're doing something really intense.

**Speaker B:** And we learn to do that as children, so when we begin to practice meditation as adults, we do the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Because when you listen to Richard Feynman talking about how to solve a problem, he's often just stepping back and taking this wider, like, "Holy shit, I got to take a second and think about this." It's wider, it's not this narrow focus to solve an issue. It's a more kind of panoramic openness to things.

**Speaker B:** That concept is actually, let us say, sprinkled throughout the suttas, but it's not actually directly specified of drawing back and taking distance. But it does have words like relinquishment, Letting go. Atta��mayatā is an example of that.

**Speaker A:** I guess the openness is even applied like with the four foundations of mindfulness, that there's actually four different like kind of dimensions of your experience that you're supposed to be aware of. It implies that it's going to be somewhat open. It's not going to be narrowed on one of the foundations necessarily. You're going to be watching the body, and the senses and the mind and the mind objects and the feelings. Yeah, it's implied there.

**Speaker B:** And we have a concept like watch closely. In fact, I remember that from a song, Watch Closely Now. But the example that I'll use is imagine that you're standing very close to the railroad tracks, let us say 5 feet from the tracks. All right, not close enough to when the train comes that you're going to get knocked over. You got to have a little distance, okay? But just a little bit of distance from the train, and as the train is speeding by, you're too close to it to see the letters on the side of the boxcars. You can't read the numbers, you can't see what company it had. You might get some color, but if you stand back 20, 30, 50 feet Now you can see the numbers on each boxcar as it rolls by. When we're too close, we can't see anything. Okay, now imagine that we're in a cycle, and inside of that cycle we're here and we like it, and then it changes to this and we don't like it, and it changes to this and we like it, we change to this and we don't like it, and we're stuck in a cycle up and down and back and forth and over again. However, if we can see by stepping back, we can see the cycle. When we're in the cycle, we can't see it. This is why I talk to the students in the sense of sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Begin to see your cycle. Watch what you're doing. Look at what it— over a longer period of time. Okay, so as we develop these skills, then the skill of being able to get into the first Jhana quickly. And then the skill of staying in the first Jhana quickly is a higher kind of skill. But in order to stay in the first Jhana means that you have to keep applying those little skills of remembering to look, gladden the mind, and to throw the hindrances out, and thus sustain this quality of feeling very good. And so we can see that, wow, that means that we've got 4 skills in the Eightfold Noble Path. Then we have those duplicated, plus we're adding Piti and Sukkha and applying the mind and sustaining it. And now we're adding getting into it quickly and being able to sustain that for a long period of time. And so we can see that there's a whole lot of skills that are put together. With that. And so this is the way that it's important for us to recognize that these little skills of Anapanasati then will help with those bigger skills, because the skill of sustaining the first Jhana is a way of getting the mind really fit for work so that we can see things clearly. And so this is now a basis for building even further skills. The skill of being able to see the arising and the passing away, which.

**Speaker A:** Is the layering you were talking about, right?

**Speaker B:** So there's many, many different layers of these skills, and there's many different ways for people to develop these skills outside of the practice of meditation and then use these skills inside meditation. That's why I really like to have students like musicians and mathematicians and computer scientists and all of that kind of stuff. Yeah, but I'm not so much interested in having accountants and lawyers because they've got skill set that's going to not do them much good when it comes to practicing correctly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't know if it's like this with other musicians, but, um, you know, I've been playing music pretty seriously for 20-something years, but the framework that you laid out, it's familiar to me, you know, in this other domain. Their skills have to be layered in this way, and the idea that you would do that makes perfect sense. Just, yeah, yeah, makes perfect sense. Well, I want to be mindful of my bedtime here. I usually go to bed pretty early, but I really enjoyed this conversation.

**Speaker B:** And yes, this has been really good. I'm glad that we've had it. It also reinforces The Anapanasati Sutta and how to practice, as well as looking at these— everything is a skill to be developed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can see why.

**Speaker B:** The skill of relaxing is a skill to be developed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I went to one of the Sangha meetings earlier today too, so it's been a nice day for my practice. Right, very nice.

**Speaker B:** Well, this has been a really good conversation. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** I'm excited for the next one. I'll see you, I think, during the next Sangha meeting, I think on Friday.

**Speaker B:** What's today? Is today Thursday?

**Speaker A:** Wednesday for me, so Thursday for you.

**Speaker B:** Wednesday, right? So it'll be Friday night, so it'll be in 2 days.

**Speaker A:** Great, I look forward to it.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Take care.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), is a detailed critique of common modern meditation methods and a presentation of a core, skill-based approach based on the Anapanasati Sutta and the Noble Eightfold Path.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: Meditation is a Set of Skills**
The central argument is that genuine meditation (Samadhi) is not a vague state of concentration but a complete set of skills to be developed. Many popular methods (like "noting" or "choiceless awareness") are likened to a car with critical parts removed—they may look like a vehicle but cannot take you anywhere. True practice requires integrating all the necessary skills.

### **Critique of Common Methods**
*   **Noting (Mahasi-style) & Choiceless Awareness:** These methods are incomplete because they lack **Right Effort**. They teach passive observation ("note it, note it deeply") without the crucial skill of actively gladdening the mind and replacing unwholesome states with wholesome ones.
*   **Concentration vs. Samadhi:** Western meditation often misinterprets Samadhi as forceful, struggle-based concentration. True Samadhi is built on ease, joy, and the systematic application of skills, not struggle.
*   **The "Stages of Insight" Problem:** The popular 16-stage model is criticized for putting people through unnecessary "dark night" experiences (despair, fear, misery). Dhammarato argues this suffering is a result of incorrect practice, not a necessary path. He suggests starting at what he sees as the essential stages: the determined effort (stage 11) leading directly into the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path (stage 12), framed by ongoing investigation (stage 16).

### **The Essential Skills to Develop**
The talk outlines a progressive skill set:
1.  **Right View (Samma Ditthi):** Not a fixed opinion, but the **skill of investigation**—looking, taking in data, and understanding cause and effect.
2.  **Mindfulness (Sati):** The **skill of remembering/ waking up** to the present moment, pulling out of daydreams. This is compared to the alertness of a martial artist in a ring.
3.  **Right Effort (Samma Vayama):** The **active skill of gladdening the mind**. This is the most frequently missing piece. It involves actively replacing negative, hindrance-based thoughts with positive, wholesome ones to create a foundation of well-being.
4.  **Right Intention/Attitude (Samma Sankappa):** This emerges from success in the first three skills. It is a **confidence and playful attitude**—a "lion's" confidence that you can handle any mental state because you know how to work with it. Success feels like "this works!" not "I am good."

### **The Role of the Body and Feelings (Vedana)**
*   The practice uses the body (especially the breath) as a tool to pull awareness out of past/future thinking and into the present.
*   Contrary to a common Western belief that emotions cannot or should not be controlled, the Buddha's path is precisely about **developing the skill to influence feelings**. We have always "talked ourselves into feeling bad"; we can learn to "talk ourselves into feeling good" through wholesome thoughts.

### **The Goal: Sukha and Jhana as Skills**
*   **Sukha (Happiness/Bliss)** is presented not as a random reward, but as a skill to be cultivated. Its components are: **safety/security, comfort, and satisfaction**. When these are present, Dukkha (suffering) is absent.
*   **The First Jhana** is re-framed not as a trance-like concentration state, but as the **integrated skill of quickly and sustainably establishing a mind free of hindrances, filled with Piti (joy/confidence) and Sukha**, based on the foundational skills.
*   This entire process is **playful and enjoyable**, not a grim struggle. The positive feedback loop makes practice self-reinforcing.

### **Practical Advice and Analogies**
*   **Short, frequent practice sessions** are encouraged over long, grueling ones.
*   Skills from other domains (like **martial arts** alertness, **music** repetition and relaxed focus, or **mathematics** problem-solving) are directly transferable to meditation.
*   The importance of a **skillful teacher** is emphasized, as texts often leave out crucial nuances (like the need for gladdening the mind), leading to widespread misunderstanding, especially in Western Buddhism.

In essence, the talk is a call to return to a **practical, skill-based, and joyful understanding of the Buddha's path**, where meditation is a learnable craft for cultivating well-being here and now, not a passive or punitive ordeal aimed at a distant future insight.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers (primarily Speaker B, Dhammarato) to explain meditation and Buddhist practice:

### **Core Metaphors**
1.  **The Incomplete Car:** Other meditation practices are likened to a car with essential parts removed (engine, seats, windows). It's still called a "vehicle," but it can't go anywhere. True *samadhi* requires all the parts (skills).
2.  **The Boxing Ring / Martial Arts:** Mindfulness (*sati*) is compared to the alertness a boxer must maintain during rounds. You only need it in specific, crucial moments (the fight), but without it, you "get hit in the face." It's a skill developed elsewhere and applicable to meditation.
3.  **Knockout Punch vs. Child's Punch:** Discernment in meditation is like a fighter distinguishing a powerful, effective "knockout punch" from weak, ineffective punches. Similarly, one learns to distinguish thoughts that are truly harmful (hindrances) from trivial ones.
4.  **Practicing an Instrument / Music:** Meditation is compared to skillfully practicing music. It involves:
    *   **Repetition:** Doing scales or exercises over and over.
    *   **Active Guidance:** Actively shaping the experience (like guiding the breath or mind), not just passive observation.
    *   **Overthinking:** Asking "how do you play that?" can cause you to screw up, just as overthinking meditation (or "concentration") creates struggle.
5.  **Homework & Struggle:** The common idea of "concentration" is compared to a child struggling with homework, adding effort and strain. True meditation is about removing that struggle and doing the task happily and easily.
6.  **The Centipede:** When asked how it walks with 100 legs, the centipede thinks about it, tries to coordinate them, and falls over. This illustrates how overthinking a well-learned skill (like walking, playing music, or meditating) disrupts it.
7.  **Watching a Train:** To see details (like letters on boxcars), you need to step back. If you're too close to the tracks, the train is just a blur. Similarly, to see mental cycles (*anicca*), you need mental distance ("relinquishment") rather than being immersed in them.
8.  **Building a Lion's Confidence:** Developing the right attitude (*samma sankappa*) is compared to becoming like a lion—confident, self-possessed, and the natural center of attention in any assembly because you "have it wired." This is contrasted with figures who inspire fear or flight.

### **Stories and Analogies**
1.  **Christianity as a Consolation Prize:** Speaker B critiques a perceived Christian model as: you're a sinner, told to stop but can't, so you confess, fail again, and are promised forgiveness and heaven. He concludes heaven would then be full of forgiven "failures" (thieves, etc.), making the difference between heaven and hell merely forgiveness. This story is used to critique passive meditation systems that note faults but don't change them.
2.  **The Fox and the Sour Grapes (Aesop's Fable):** Referenced to describe the attitude in some meditation circles: if you can't achieve a goal (like controlling feelings), you devalue it ("the grapes were sour anyway"). This rationalizes not developing the skill to change one's emotional state.
3.  **The Teacher and the Daydreaming Student:** The skill of *sati* (remembering/waking up) is like a teacher snapping a student (Johnny) out of a daydream and back to the present lesson.
4.  **Historical Shift in Buddhist Practice:** A story is implied about the transmission of the *Mahasi* method. After Mahasi Sayadaw died, his successor (U Pandita) is said to have made the practice "really tough," which, combined with Westerners missing the cultural context of joy, led to a dry, effortful version of "noting" practice online.

### **Conceptual Metaphors (Implied Comparisons)**
*   **Meditation as a Skill Set:** The entire talk frames meditation not as a state to achieve, but as a collection of portable, learnable skills (like martial arts or music).
*   **Hindrances as Manageable Intruders:** They are not monolithic barriers but things you can "throw out" playfully and with humor, once you have the skill.
*   **Sukkha as Safety, Comfort, Satisfaction:** *Sukkha* (bliss/happiness) is explicitly broken down into the feeling of being **safe** (no real danger is present), **comfortable** (bodily relaxation), and **satisfied** in the present moment.
*   **The "Gladdening of the Mind" as a Key Mechanism:** This is presented as the crucial, often-missing skill—actively brightening the mind—which is the antidote to the downward spiral of negative noting.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors consistently contrast two models:
*   **The Wrong Model:** Struggle, passive observation, endurance of pain, narrow concentration, and deferred gratification (like a rigged lottery).
*   **The Right Model:** Playful skill-building, active guidance, ease, joyful repetition, open awareness, and immediate, tangible results that create a self-reinforcing feedback loop.
