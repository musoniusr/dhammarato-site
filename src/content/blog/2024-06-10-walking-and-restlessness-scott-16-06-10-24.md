### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so let's repeat it for recording's sake. So go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I just asked Dhammarato a question about sitting still and the hindrance of restlessness. I mentioned how I can more easily get into a good state when I'm walking. Or moving in some kind of way. And Dhammarato recommended— do you want me to recap it?

**Speaker A:** No, no, I'll do that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** That basically what you had mentioned, Scott, was that you were following someone's plan of you've got to sit still. And when you have to sit still, that's when the restlessness comes back. And so what I would recommend is to start off walking, because you can do it there. And as you start off walking and whistle a happy tune and get yourself into a really, really good state, then that's the time to sit down. That in fact that's something that we practice at Wat Soan Muak on a regular basis in the retreats, is a combination of sitting, walking, sitting, walking. And that you can probably start walking in a regular pace, but then begin to slow it down. As you slow the walking down, that will actually kind of help the restlessness come back. But when you can deal with the restlessness in walking, then when you get it done and you are in a calm state, a happy state in walking, then sit down and sit with the thoughts: I could do this, restlessness is not a problem, I can handle this. If restlessness comes back, I know exactly what to do with it. And as it— if it does come back, then what do we do? We get up and we start walking again, as you're doing right now.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** You see, you have actually been quite active in your life. You're quite a sportsman, right?

**Speaker B:** I'm very active, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that restlessness then is built into that, but it need not be a worry. What actually becomes a problem is because you've been told to sit still for a long time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, talk about early childhood.

**Speaker A:** And that's become a rule for you, and it's what the Buddha talks about, is the rules we make for ourselves is often the problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the sitting still rule, that goes way back. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the right way to handle it then is that if you are sitting and restlessness comes up, then happily stand up, say, aha, I see you, restlessness, let's take you for a walk. The dog's got to go out for a walk right now. And so you take your restless dog for a walk, and while you're doing.

**Speaker B:** That— that reminds me of the dog analogy, the Nibbana dog that walks around. Yeah, that you use sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So that's the way of handling it, is just take the dog for a walk happily, not worrying about that there's a problem with restlessness. The problem with restlessness is you've got a rule: thou shalt not restless. You've got to sit still for a long time, and that actually interferes with a lot of people, especially people who are sports-minded.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So sit for a while, sit for 10 or 15 minutes or ever how long, but when that restlessness comes back up, stand up. In fact, you might even want to do it in this order: stand up and see if the restlessness goes away. If it doesn't, Take a few steps and then a few more and keep walking until the restlessness goes away completely and then sit back down. In other words, you're training in a new way now. You're training in a way that the restlessness is not there when you sit down and it will come back up I'm sure it will. And when it does, take a hike. That should be fairly easy instructions for you to remember, is to alternate back and forth between walking, sitting, and standing. But mostly it's going to be walking and sitting and walking and sitting. And so go out, go out and pay attention to how marvelous the paradise you're in is. And that doesn't mean you're reading billboards and looking at cars and things like that, but whether you're just— wow, how nice it feels to be out. So if you can go to a park or to the forest to do the walking, that's better.

**Speaker B:** That brings back a good memory, uh, the first time I called you and you gave me, uh, the talking myself into it instruction. I had my favorite park that I would go to. And I remember so vividly the first time I got into first Jhana at that park. And every time I go to that park, I feel good, like it's so beautiful. Oh, what a nice day. There's some children laughing and playing, people out and about. Wow.

**Speaker A:** Well, while you're doing that then, and now enjoying that park and enjoying the paradise you're in, if you happen to walk past a park bench, just sit down and just stay still for a little while. And then if the restlessness comes, get back up and continue walking. Don't make the restlessness a problem. It's not a problem. It's easy. So you can say, oh, it's so easy. There's no place to go and nothing to do. Ah, what a relief it is. I can sit, I can walk, I can stand. And when the restlessness comes, I can do something about it. I don't have to let it overcome me. I don't have to hate it. It's just there it is. I see it. Let's take a walk.

**Speaker B:** Another unwholesome, unwholesome thought that comes up generally when I'm thinking about my life is that, oh, I should be making more money. People, I don't have a career, like I'm just doing my job that's not too hard.

**Speaker A:** So who's hard on you? Who else besides you are giving you all of this grief? Is this just an old memory, or is somebody hassling you about going and getting a job?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, uh, people who are related to me. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, but you've got enough money, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And I always have the option. I have enough, plenty of money to also get my plan for sustainable, keep doing what I'm doing is if I get a van that I can live in, um, even with some amenities. I could sustain my current lifestyle without relying on anybody else also. But, but then my mom shames me. Oh, I don't want you living in a car. I don't want you— like, there's like a stigma, I guess, like an ex— that, that's like not okay to do. But the Buddha was a homeless guy, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, well, I'm sure that you can come to some sort of compromise and agreement with your mom.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now, one of the ways that you can do that is because she probably already knows that she's better off with you in that house. Yeah, that she's better off, and so are you. Yeah, this American dream to where a guy's got to go buy a house he can't afford, it's too big for him to take care of, he's going to have to have a wife and kids to take care of the house. Yeah, all of that kind of stuff. No, if your mom's already got the house, then you're helping her. Yeah, you can help clean, you can help her, uh, giving her companionship and all kinds of other stuff. So a lot of what your mom is saying is that she doesn't want to lose you. Yeah, so even if you do get a van, I tell you what, I know a really excellent parking place. Yeah, in her driveway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that'll give you the freedom in both, both sides of it, so you can go off with your van and also take care of her. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That was pretty spot on with the situation because, yeah, she does benefit from the companionship and my whimsical nature. Reminder, hey, life's not serious. It's all.

**Speaker A:** Good. You can call it a whimsical nature if you want to, but I see that as actually quite beautiful. I like it when guys decide that, oh, that job and that house and all of that stuff that you're supposed to do from the training that we've had our whole lives is actually detrimental to everybody. Yeah, look at the housing market. Why? Because the real estate people, they want to make a lot of money. They want to put you in a house you can't afford because they'll make more money that way. And having the idea of a tiny house or shared apartment, shared living, is what's been going on in Asia for many, many centuries. Family living, communal living. So you living with your mom is actually quite beneficial to her. It's just the real estate people that are not making money off of you. Yeah. And so putting a shed in the backyard, making gazebo, go find, you know, make a little place for you to go hang out, but it's got no walls because you're in Southern California. California, you don't have to worry about the weather.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** By the way, the gazebo of the West is— it's got a word in Thai, in, uh, yeah, actually it's a Pali word, it's called a sala. And a sala is a building that's got very little for a floor. Very little or nothing for a wall, and it's got a roof to keep the rain and the sun out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a sala on wheels would be perfect because I can go into very remote places if I have a sala on wheels. Obviously I can come back, park it at the house, but I can get, like you've recommended, like the Buddha recommends, very isolated places where there's no city, no people.

**Speaker A:** And no jobs to do. Yeah, and it's just not— no office buildings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's just not affordable to get a hotel because I go to these remote places but get a hotel and then hike out. But it's not not affordable to keep getting a hotel.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, no, well, a good tent, a really good tent would be the price of 1 or 2 nights in a hotel, right?

**Speaker B:** That you can— a tent that you can carry on your back.

**Speaker A:** Um, that's portable housing, is what you can pack up and carry with you. That's what there is actually The system for the monks is that there are two robes. One robe is for wearing and the other one is called a double robe, which means it is actually two robes that are stitched together, but it's got air pockets and whatever like that. And that is called a Sanghati. And that Sanghati can be used for a chair, it can be used for a headrest. And with a pole or a wire, it can be used as a tent. And so the monk— the outfit of a monk in the time of the Buddha was designed for camping gear. That was a 2,600-year-old camping gear. And so you can use modern camping gear. With a backpack and a bedroll and a tent, and all of that can be put into a backpack. Then you don't have to go buy a car or a new van or whatever. What the transportation that you've got now will be good enough.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's a good point. I— yeah, I have my car.

**Speaker A:** So load it down with camping gear. Park it in some small town and hike off into the wilderness. In fact, one of the places that's really good, if you can get up to it— there's two of them, both of which are a little bit far from you— but I do know that one is Wat Metta, which is where Achan Thanesaroen And you go camp out there.

**Speaker B:** I went there.

**Speaker A:** And the other one would be Awad Amaravati, which is up in Mendocino County.

**Speaker B:** What— when I go, like, the Sierra Nevada mountain range, like, that's where I snowboard, but when I just go there, it's so spectacular that Jhana is just so easy to get into. Like, I've had some of the most, like, just euphoric moments, almost like you— like, almost like tears come out of your eyes. And I'm satisfied in that moment fully. Like, I don't need anything else. Like, I don't need—.

**Speaker A:** That's great. You're very lucky. You designed your lifestyle well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thanks for saying that. I don't want to have kids. Yeah, I don't want to have to like take care, like be responsible for kids. I like being free.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're okay. You got it. Go hiking, go camping. But this is exactly what the Buddha recommended. Go to the forest, sit down at the foot of a tree, take a tent so that the tent can be used in the shade and it can keep the rain off. I tell you what, some of the best music there is is to be in a tent while it's raining.

**Speaker B:** The sound of rushing water, a tent by a river especially, like just that soothing sound of the water rushing.

**Speaker A:** This is great.

**Speaker B:** This is great. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So why don't we end the call now? I think you've gotten just what you needed.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay. Well, thank you so much. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Okay. See you next time.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Teaching: Working Skillfully with Restlessness**
The central question was about dealing with restlessness (*uddhacca-kukkucca*) during meditation, especially when trying to sit still.

*   **The Problem:** The practitioner (B) finds it easier to enter a good meditative state while walking or moving. The instruction to "sit still" triggers a rule-based anxiety and amplifies restlessness, a pattern potentially stemming from childhood.
*   **The Practical Solution:** Dhammarato advises **not to fight the restlessness or see it as a failure.** Instead, use a dynamic, flexible approach:
    1.  **Start with walking meditation** to cultivate a happy, calm state ("whistle a happy tune").
    2.  **Sit down only once that good state is established.** Sit with the confidence that restlessness can be managed.
    3.  **If restlessness arises while sitting, happily get up and walk again.** The analogy is to "take the restless dog for a walk." This alternation between walking and sitting is a standard practice (as done at Wat Soan Muak).
    4.  **Remove the unhelpful rule:** The issue isn't restlessness itself, but the self-imposed commandment "thou shalt not restless." The training is to respond wisely, not to suffer from the expectation of perfect stillness.

### **Supporting Themes and Personal Advice**
The conversation expanded into related life themes:

*   **Lifestyle and Societal Expectations:** B expressed guilt over not pursuing a conventional career or more money. Dhammarato reframed this, praising B's "whimsical nature" and intentional simplicity.
    *   He challenged the "American dream" of excessive home ownership as often detrimental.
    *   He validated B's current living situation (with his mother) as beneficial **communal/family living**, offering companionship and support.
    *   He suggested creative compromises, like parking a van in the mother's driveway or building a simple shelter (*sala*) in the backyard.

*   **Nature as a Support for Practice:** Both agreed on the profound value of nature for meditation.
    *   B recalled easily achieving *jhana* (deep meditative absorption) in beautiful, remote natural settings like parks and the Sierra Nevada.
    *   Dhammarato strongly recommended **camping and forest retreats** as aligned with the Buddha's instructions to seek out secluded places. He even noted that the monk's robe (*Sanghati*) was originally designed as versatile camping gear.

*   **Freedom and Contentment:** The talk celebrated designing a life oriented toward **freedom and contentment** rather than societal metrics of success. B's desire to be free from major responsibilities (like having children) to pursue hiking and meditation was affirmed as a valid and well-designed path.

### **Overall Message**
The Dhamma talk emphasized **pragmatic flexibility and self-kindness in practice.** The path is about skillfully working with one's own conditions (like an active, restless body-mind) rather than forcing oneself into an idealized mold. This practical wisdom extends to life choices, encouraging a lifestyle that supports peace, contentment, and deep meditation, often found in simplicity and nature. The hindrance of restlessness is not an enemy but a signal to skillfully change posture and continue the training.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Restless Dog Metaphor**
This is the central and most developed metaphor. Restlessness is compared to a dog that needs to be walked.
*   **Key Quote:** "take your restless dog for a walk..."
*   **Purpose:** To reframe restlessness from a problem to be suppressed into a natural energy to be managed with kindness and activity. It makes the instruction ("when restless, walk") intuitive and non-judgmental.

**2. The "Rule" or "Training" Story**
The speaker identifies the root problem not as restlessness itself, but as a self-imposed, rigid rule.
*   **Key Quote:** "the rules we make for ourselves is often the problem... thou shalt not restless."
*   **Purpose:** To shift the blame from a personal failing to a mistaken strategy. This story connects the listener's struggle to a broader Buddhist teaching on attachment to rules (sīlabbata-parāmāsa).

**3. The "Paradise" Metaphor**
The immediate environment (a park, the forest) is referred to as a "paradise."
*   **Key Quote:** "pay attention to how marvelous the paradise you're in is."
*   **Purpose:** To encourage appreciation and joyful presence in the current moment and setting, making meditation about connecting with beauty rather than battling internal states.

**4. The Monk's Robe as Ancient Camping Gear**
A historical anecdote about the practical design of a Buddhist monk's robe (the *sanghati*).
*   **Key Quote:** "the outfit of a monk in the time of the Buddha was designed for camping gear. That was a 2,600-year-old camping gear."
*   **Purpose:** To legitimize and spiritually connect the listener's desire for a simple, mobile lifestyle (living in a van, camping) to the ascetic tradition of the Buddha himself. It's a story that validates his choices.

**5. The "American Dream" Counter-Story**
This is presented as a contrasting, culturally imposed narrative.
*   **Key Quote:** "this American dream to where a guy's got to go buy a house he can't afford..."
*   **Purpose:** To explicitly name and challenge the societal pressure the listener feels (regarding career, house, family) and to position the listener's alternative lifestyle as wise and beneficial, not deficient.

**6. Minor Analogies and References:**
*   **"Whistle a happy tune":** A simple story/image for actively cultivating a joyful mood to begin practice.
*   **The Sala (Gazebo):** A brief story about a specific architectural form (a shelter with no walls) to illustrate the ideal of simple, open-air living.
*   **"The sound of rushing water... the best music":** A poetic metaphor framing natural sounds as superior entertainment, reinforcing the value of nature over commercial or urban life.

**Overall Purpose:** The metaphors and stories work together to **normalize the listener's experience** (restlessness, non-conformity), **reframe challenges** as manageable, and **validate his preferred lifestyle** by connecting it to Buddhist tradition and wisdom. They turn advice from a set of instructions into a coherent and empowering narrative.
