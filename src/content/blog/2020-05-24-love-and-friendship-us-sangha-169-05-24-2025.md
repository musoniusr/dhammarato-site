### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so it's Saturday morning, a little after 9 o'clock. Looks like we've got about 16, 17 people on the call today. That's good. We'll probably get some more soon enough. Today we're going to be talking about longing and the various forms that we have with it, and that the image I was just asking everybody to see is the image of a dog where you can see in the eyes that the dog wants something. Now, generally what we can say about, let's say, the animal kingdom in general is that what animals want is easily enough for them to get. An example of that would be the lion. When the lion goes hunting and kills, then the lion pride will eat the carcass. And if it's a water buffalo or something, they can't even finish it all. And then what will happen is, is that they'll sit around for quite a number of days, sometimes up to a week, and just hang out and do nothing at all. And then one of them will get hungry finally. And they'll go off on the hunt again, in the sense that the only thing that the lion wants, he can get easily enough. The same thing would be true about sex. Now, generally, sex in animal kingdom has to do with a certain condition, a certain odor that the female will put off. When I was a child, they called it being in heat. Or being in season. And dogs don't care much about sex until they have that olfactory key hit off, and now they want it. But now let's look at that dog again and see that that dog wants something, but there is no way that he can get it. So that dog is wanting something he does not have, and the only way that he can get it is probably from a human. I want to go out. I want to play with a toy. I want you to scratch my back, something like that. And so the dogs have actually been with humans for so many, many thousands of years that they have actually picked up on that wanting things that they don't have. Other animals do it too. There, in fact, back in the '80s, there was a gorilla, female gorilla named Koko, and that they trained that gorilla for about 600 different words. She would use sign language, but in the process of her learning that language, she also learned to want things that she didn't have. So she picked that up. And so I'm talking about a particular human trait of wanting things that we don't have. Now, this is, uh, uh, uh, something that was picked up by the Buddha before he was enlightened, and that became his quest. About wanting things that we don't have. He called that Dukkha. That in fact, in Sutta number 9 in the Majjhima Nikaya, that's part of the classical definition of Dukkha. It starts off with old age, sickness, and death, lamentation, crying, and wanting things. In fact, then it comes to the actual definition: wanting things that you don't have, or putting up with things that are hard to put up with. Now, the wanting things that you can't have is kind of interesting. When humans picked that up, I would think that it was so long ago that it was before humans, before we were actually fully human. We were some other species, but already then they began to have dissatisfactions. They started wanting things that they didn't have. All right, so Alex, did you show up finally? Yeah, there you are.

**Speaker B:** I did, I'm here.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we can start in on the— this part of the talk was, is that you asked the question about friendship, right? Okay, so friendship is something that the Buddha was very big on. There are several different ways that we can look at it. One of them is that there is a sutta where, in fact, the name of the sutta is the Half Sutta, where Ananda had come back from Sariputta where Siriputta, he had discussed how important friendship was, and that Ananda said to the Buddha that friendship is half the path. And the Buddha contradicted him by saying, "Oh no, friendship is the whole path." Now there's two ways of looking at that. One of them is that it's the entire path, And the other one is that friendship makes the path whole. It's the whole of the path. The other part that we can talk about from that is what is referred to as the Triple Gem, which is at every Buddha Day at every wat in Thailand, they do a ceremony that has to do with the Triple Gem. Buddha�� sattva��a�� gacchāmi, Dhamma�� sattva��a�� gacchāmi, and Sangha�� sattva��a�� gacchāmi. This is the Triple Gem. Okay. What we mean by that Buddha is that anyone and everyone who practices correctly can become free from the Dukkha. And that the Dharma is the path that leads us to the end of Dukkha, and that Sangha is the collection of friends who are practicing the Noble Dharma for the release from the Dukkha. This is actually quite important. As you know, doing first on Skype and now on Discord, that promoting friendship among the noble Sangha is quite important. And so we've talked about that a lot. And now I see actually in the past few weeks, in fact, there has been a lot of one-on-one calls or people communicating with one another, making friends online. And this is exactly what's needed to be done. There are several issues about that. And one of them is, is that the more often you're talking to nobles about the Dhamma, the more ingrained it gets that this has to be done habitually. It has to be done on a regular basis over and over and over again. It's practiced. It's not practiced in some high-polluting, great big way, but it is repetitive, is to come out of our Dukkha in this particular moment and come into a state of Sukkha. Now Sukkha is exactly opposite of Dukkha. Sukkha actually means satisfaction, and satisfaction actually has several components to it. According to the Pali lexicons, it has the quality of being safe and secure. If you're not safe and you're not secure, you can't have satisfaction. If you have safety and security but you're uncomfortable, you cannot have satisfaction. But if you can find a way of getting safe, secure, comfortable, then we can promote and bring about a state of satisfaction. Now, satisfaction is either on or off. You're either satisfied or you're not. And I have had people come and say, "Oh, well, I feel satisfied, but it's not very much satisfaction." What that means is that they're not satisfied, they're dissatisfied. They're lying to themselves thinking that they've got a little bit, but they're telling the truth when they're saying that it's not enough. Okay, now that may in fact be a one-two punch. It may be in fact that they practice just long enough to bring on satisfaction, and then the unwholesome hindrances came back in: "Oh, well, this is not good enough." And the way that we handle that is: "Never mind, start again, come back into the state of satisfaction." We need to keep promoting that over and over and over again. And so, having good friends will help with that, if the friends are noble. Now one of the things that I have noticed from time to time, especially on Procrastination server is that people come on and vent, they come on and complain, they come on and be unhappy, they tell about what happened here and there. And this is actually not what we want to use the service for. We want to promote people staying in wholesome states, because we know that everybody's capable of being in an unwholesome state. There's no reason for anyone to come onto the servers and complain about anything, that we're not going to commiserate. We're going to say, no, this is noble service. We're going to promote being friendly and happy with one another. This is your opportunity to do that. And so this is what we would promote. Is for you to spend your time on Discord in a happy, wholesome state. It's okay to bring up topics. It's okay to post videos of monks and things. It's okay to raise certain topics of Dharma and all of that kind of stuff, so long as it's done wholesomely. And this will help us train in what is wholesome. This is why we have a Sangha. We have a lot of friends who know the difference between what is wholesome and what is not wholesome. And so this is why we would have friendship. And I'll go back and say again that this practice of being around noble friends who are helping you to stay in a noble mind state That's what makes the Dharma whole. Most of you, in fact, have started your spiritual journey practicing all on your own, maybe being around a teacher once a week or once a month or once a year, doing a retreat once a year, those kind of things, to where what we actually want is to be able to be around friends every day. Every day come on to Discord and find something noble to say to some of our friends. So, um, Alex, do you have any specific questions about friendship?

**Speaker B:** One of the things I was thinking on when I was considering friendship, especially within the context of our community, is What are some ways that people that are really looking to get into the Dharma, how do they often find themselves starting to talk about it with a community? Does that make sense? Like, I kind of fell into it, you know, I found you and started talking with you and whatnot. But for some people that maybe are looking to get a little more into it, what are some things you would recommend we talk about?

**Speaker A:** Okay. I would start off then by saying something wholesome. That we've already learned about from our practice of. So you can just open up the Discord and say, no place to go and nothing to do, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself, hahaha. See what kind of response you get. Or you open the Discord and say, wow, what a great day this is. Now that's actually kind of unwholesome in the sense that the days are not great, it's your attitude about the day. So you can say something like, "Wow, right now everything is great. Everything is just fine. Not a worry in the world. Everything is okay." It's got nothing to do with the day. It has to do with your internal attitudes about things. So this is how I would approach it, is just to come on and instead of, "Oh, I can't get to sleep," That's not a wholesome thing to say. A much better thing to say is, wow, I'm up, and so I thought that I would say hi to you guys. So this is the way that we would practice staying in the state of wholesome, staying in a state of friendship. Now here's something that's very good that we can talk about in the sense that friendship is actually fairly easy to define. We can use the word kindness. In fact, the Dalai Lama used that word. There was a bumper sticker back in the 1980s, and the bumper sticker said, "Kindness is my religion." So we come on and we be kind to each other. Kindness actually would be Anicca, be kind to each other by not complaining to each other. But rather have something really wholesome to say. So does anybody have any questions about this? This is to be practiced over and over again. Practice on your own. Practice— in fact, I see Anicca and several others are going on, and Dhamma Dasha also. Of just coming on and hanging out together quietly, not have anything to say, just being there together. So this is something that we can practice together. Whatever it is, it's creating harmony, it's creating wholeness, the wholeness of the Dharma. So if we don't have any questions— Zero, do you have anything to say? How about you, Ivan, Arjun, Santiago? Any of you have any questions about this so far?

**Speaker C:** I have actually something to say about complaining. I woke up and it is raining all day. It's raining since, since few hours, and normally when it rains, I don't go outside. I just I just remain inside. I just stay inside. Then I thought in the morning, you know, I'm just complaining. Whenever it is raining, I just complain. So then I thought, you know, I will just wait till it rains even harder and then I will go outside and I will not allow myself to complain even for one second. So I went in the rain outside to the 7-Eleven and bought something and came back. Without complaining. And because there was no complaining, well, the retreat was enjoyable to do it. I thought, what would it be if I truly stop all form of complaining from the moment I wake up until the moment I sleep?

**Speaker A:** Because if I just— That's part of the practice. That, in fact, if you can catch yourself complaining about anything, aha, I see that complaining. Because the complaining itself is already coming from a state of Dukkha, dissatisfaction. And when you're complaining, you're just keeping it going, you're reiterating it, that in fact you're making it more so when you could in fact be practicing going in the opposite direction. An example of rain is, wow, the rain makes a really strong noise on the roof of these houses here in Thailand. If it's a tin roof, it's really drowsy. This house has got pressed asbestos, and it's quite noisy. I love the rain. It's beautiful. It cleans the air. The trees love it. They sway back and forth. Oh, they get a bath. Everything is so beautiful in the rain. And so start thinking about happy thoughts for the rain. And come out of our complaining nature. That's the whole point, is that we stop having— in fact, we do not need a complaint department because nobody's complaining about anything. Why is that? It's because they've practiced enough that they recognize that complaining is unwholesome. The same thing is true about comparing ourselves to one another. Just be okay by yourself. You don't have to be better than or less than or looking up to or down upon anyone. So complaining and comparisons are two different forms of Dukkha. In fact, you could say that they're both fetters. So this is the way of practicing, is just to stop complaining. Don't complain on Discord. Make sure that before you hit that send key, am I complaining about something? And then we can change that. So now that we've talked about friendship We have another topic to talk about, and that is many people think that the word love has something to do with friendship. But I would like everyone to listen very closely. Rather than disagreeing with what I have, just be open and listen to what's being said. Because our society is great, great big on love. Now, to start off, in Christianity they talk about Christian love. In fact, the word that's in the Greek is agape. Now, agape is actually in the Greek is fairly close to the word in Spanish of amigo. Agape actually is Let's not use love, let's use friendship as an alternative. Let's be the Three Amigos. Let's not have love involved with it. Now one of the things that we can say automatically is that love has sexuality built into it. Love and lust are pretty close together. And so it's actually not necessarily a good state. Have you ever heard of the story of the boy that was so in love that he was called lovesick? There are songs: I love you, I want you, I need you. Okay, so love actually is Dukkha. When you love something, that means that you want it, you want to hold it. "I would die without you" is the kind of extreme form of it. "Oh, I love you so much." Or the other part of it would be, "I love you, therefore you've got to do what I tell you to do." Moms use this with their kids. Boys use this with the girls, the girls use this with the boys. Oh, I love you so much, will you go and grovel for me? Would you go clean my toilet? I love you. In fact, I hear that that's a major quality of Christianity. God loves you, therefore you got to do what you're told to do. How many have ever seen it that way? God loves you, Karwan, therefore you gotta do what you're told to do. All right, so it's controlling. It also has the quality of— let me give you an example. The example is the phrase, don't you just love her dress? Now, one of the places that you can hear that is, let us say, there was a television series by the name of The Golden Girls. So imagine the Golden Girls are looking out in a party or something, and they see this young lady in this dress, and they say in a very catty fashion, "Oh, don't you just love her dress?" A bit of jealousy there. All right, so you can imagine we can take that a little further. Imagine that there's young ladies there and one of the ladies has a dress just like that, and so she says, "Don't you just love her dress?" which means that's jealousy. We can also say that the boy brings the girl in that dress up to her mom and tells her mom, "Don't you just love this dress?" Well, in that case, it's not even the dress that he's presenting. Presenting the girl, but he's sideswiping, saying, "Don't you just love this dress?" Another example would be that this is a designer dress, this is done by some bigwig designer, and he goes and says, "Don't you just love this dress?" And now he's talking from the sense of pride. So in all of these cases, loving the dress really is Dukkha for each one of these people. And so if we understand that loving means that you want it, you want it, you want it really badly— he wants that girl, that guy wants that car, we love it— uh, in this case though, you can actually then Translate that into the Buddhist word, actually it's become kind of Buddhist in the sense of craving. We want it. This would be a way of talking about love. If we begin to see the word love like that, we will begin to not use that word so much. Now I know that some people have gotten a kind of a positive and negative aspect to it, that the mother is supposed to love her children. Actually, mom don't need to love her children. She'd probably take care of them better if she just liked them. But when she loves her kids, that means that she's going to make them conform, she's going to make them do what she wants them to do, They're going to be little versions of her. She's going to train them so that they're like her. So this is a way of looking at this whole concept of love, is that it has negative qualities to it. It also has comparisons. Don't you love this more than that? Mothers will say, "Oh, I love this kid and I don't love that kid so much," and other mothers will say, "Oh, I love both my kids equally," but then she treats them differently. And so, it's better that we not use this word, or if you do use it, be careful about using it. In fact, this is one of those words that I would put on our watch out for this word list. We've got several words that we have on watch out for this word list. Another one would be try. Another one would be hard. Oh, this is so hard. Oh, meditation is so hard. Well, that's actually Dukkha words. It's not hard at all. That's just an attitude of being hard. Okay, another one would be try. Oh, I'll try it. Well, try actually has the anticipation of failure built right into it. And so now we can put another word on that list, and that is love. Be careful about using the love. For instance, if you own Discord, you say, oh, I love you, brother. Somebody's going to pick up that and think somebody's gay because they can't help but put sex in it.. But if we can just use the word friend— oh, I really enjoy your friendship— then that doesn't have any heat built into it. Hey Scott, glad to see you. Hello. Yeah, you're my dear friend. Yeah, yeah, we were going to talk yesterday, but that didn't happen.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, no worries, no.

**Speaker A:** Worries. Okay, so look around this group here that we've got and recognize which one of the people here do you think is a really close friend of yours. I see quite a number of them here that are my friends. I've known them for a while. And so we're promoting friendship, not love. So this is actually not a very long talk. Does anybody have any questions? Santiago? Okay, Clay, go.

**Speaker D:** Ahead.

**Speaker E:** Have you ever realized that you were in.

**Speaker A:** Love? That was so long ago, I've forgotten all about it. But I will say now that Tam is a really, really good friend, that this is what should happen in every marriage, is that they go out of love into companionship, friendship. They take care of one another. They deal with one another as best friends. That in fact, if the people try to keep the love in the relationship, it's probably going to wind up in divorce. Jealousies, all kinds of things. And so we have to take the love out of the marriage before it falls apart, and then we can be good.

**Speaker C:** Friends.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, who's Tam?

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker E:** Did you say.

**Speaker A:** Tam? Tam's— she's here someplace.

**Speaker E:** Oh, is that your friend?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, she's my friend. That's what I.

**Speaker E:** Just said. Okay, but do you like— okay, but do you know what I'm— okay, could you remember enough to kind of estimate in what I'm saying what I mean by.

**Speaker A:** Love? Yes, you know what I mean. And everyone here knows love, and everyone here has been hurt through it, by it, and doing it. And yet we still use it because it's such a common word in English language.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, but do you like when— like, do you like the way that Tam.

**Speaker A:** Smiles? What?

**Speaker E:** Like, I'm talking about those features of love which are like, you kind of differentiate between friendship. I'm getting to that.

**Speaker A:** Point. Yeah, the difference is, is that with friendship you can enjoy someone without wanting anything from them or wanting to do anything to them. But when you love somebody, you either want them to do something for you or to you, or you want to do something to them. So in fact, you could say that friendship has the quality of bringing people together into a wholeness, and love keeps people.

**Speaker E:** Separated.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. Christine, do you have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker F:** When I think about love, I think there's part of me that there's like a fear baked into it. Where there's like a fear of losing that person that you love so much.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yes, that's very good. Thank you for bringing that up. Yes, if we love someone, there's automatically fear into it. Why? Because we're clinging to them. We might lose it. But if you've got friends, there's no possibility of losing them as a friend, even if you never see them again. They're still your friend. But if you love somebody, then you miss them when they're gone. Now, here's something very interesting about the Thai language. In English, when there's absence, we say, 'I miss them.' That's actually a statement that adds to that quality of Dukkha. I miss them. I'm heartbroken. I want to see them again. But in Thai language, they have a different phrase. They say, "Kit tun kun," which means, "I was thinking about you." So you can think about someone and be good friends with them, But if you miss somebody, that's got that quality of love built into it because it's got clinging and wanting. Santiago, do you have something to say? I think it's great. There's a Dukkha element mixed into the high of being in love. You go towards the sun, you get burned real good once you don't have it no more. Uh-huh, right. When you're in love with someone, you got butterflies in your stomach, you get, um, uh, agitated, you get, um, uh, how to say it, uh, uh, you, you want to go and say hi to her, but you're afraid of rejection. And so there's fear of rejection, there's fear of loss, there's all kinds of fears that are built into love. That you don't have when you've got high-quality noble friendship. So Mr. Potato, what do you think?

**Speaker G:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I think I feel good. I think this community is wonderful. I.

**Speaker A:** Think I might fall in love again, but I want to get more established in the Dharma first. All right. Maybe you can have a good friend and you don't have to go through all of the downside of being in love. Excitement, anticipation. I got to have it. In fact, I'll say this, that at one time, many, many years ago, let's say 50— yeah, 50 is a good word, how about 55, something like that— I did have the impression that if I got laid, that meant that the girl loved me. And I would go around getting laid over and over and over again, almost like putting a notch on my pecker or a gun for every kill that I made. But guess what? None of those, uh, receptacles of love have— no matter how many women I had to love me, I still didn't feel loved. Not enough. Can't get enough. Or as I think it was Springsteen, it says, can't get no satisfaction. I can get laid all over the place, but I can't get no satisfaction. And so this is actually part of the quality of that longing, that wanting. And we get it. That's kind of like, um, we talked about last time, hunger and happiness, that there is two kinds of happiness. One is the happiness of getting the hunger fulfilled. So getting laid, that's a lot of happiness for a short period of time. You get laid in the night, and by 7 AM it's time to get up and go to work. And where's your happiness now? It's already gone. And we're thinking about, well, who am I going to lay tonight? And over and over and over we repeat it. So if we in fact can come to the point of being satisfied without that hunger, then in fact that's the real happiness, is that you have no more hunger for it. And now this is a training. To train yourself in to stop getting short-term happiness by getting what you want and start planning on being happy because you don't get what you want, because you don't want it anymore. You stop with the loving and start in with friendship. So, Karwan, do you have something to.

**Speaker C:** Say? I love you.

**Speaker A:** Man. Can't get no satisfaction here.

**Speaker C:** Friend. I'm enjoying, I'm just enjoying it. And yeah, thank you for.

**Speaker A:** Sharing. Somebody has written up there, so you can't have love? Who wrote.

**Speaker D:** Something? Baked Potato asked, so you can't— so you're not allowed to love? That's what she asked.

**Speaker A:** Who was that?

**Speaker D:** Baked Potato.

**Speaker A:** A Baked Potato, which is different than Mr. Potato. Okay. So we're talking about— and use the word, the word love. You've been using it and you want to continue to use it as if it were a good thing, and now you're asking me, oh, that means I can't use it anymore? Well, not my problem. That's up to you so that you can decide for yourself whether you're going to continue in that spiral of temporarily getting what you want, followed by, as Christine was talking about, is the fear of loss, the fear of it ending. Love has the quality of clinging. It has the quality of wanting it to continue, and that often we drive are made away. I've seen that so often. In fact, in the United States, the divorce rate is higher than 50%. So about half or more of all relationships, solid relationships, marriages, are going to end in divorce. What does that mean? That means that people fell out of love with one another, and it generally means really that one increases his love to the point that he smothers the other person and they feel like they have to escape. I've seen that many times, that guys will get jealous. He wants to know where his wife has been. And guess what? After a while of that, she's going to bend someplace else. She's not going to bend around him. Because he's smothering her because he wants her too much. Does that answer your question, baked potato?

**Speaker H:** And that's what the Buddha instruction for enlightenment is disenchantment from cravings.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. That's a very interesting word, disenchantment. There's other words that have that quality also. Disillusioned. But the word Disenchanted comes with the idea of enchantment, and that the chanting quality is doing something over and over and over and over again to try to make it real. And disenchantment means that it didn't matter how many times you did it over and over again, you didn't make it.

**Speaker B:** Real.

**Speaker A:** You become.

**Speaker D:** Disenchanted.

**Speaker A:** We become disappointed. We become dissatisfied because wanting something, whether you have it for a while, when you lose it, then in fact the way to say it is like this: when you want it and you don't have it, that's Dukkha. When you want it and you get it, Now you've got to take care of it to keep it because you really want to keep it. But no matter what you do, in fact, the harder you try to keep it, the more likely you are you're going to lose it. And when you lose it, now you really feel bad. So you want it, you feel bad, you get it, and now you got to keep it and you feel bad, and then you eventually lose it and you feel bad. That's kind of like a three-way losing, and that if you didn't want it in the first place, you're a happy camper. You're already okay. So this is what I would recommend for a baked potato, is to change her mind about it from wanting to be in love with all the excitement into merely having close, happy friendships. Ivan, do you have something to.

**Speaker E:** Say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was thinking about, you know, in psychology they have, they call like people with trauma and there's a lot of psychology called DPDSD or whatever. And something I realized, people that that has trauma really seek out love, and it never worked out well for them from my experience again and again because the perception was wrong to begin with. The intention was kind of off to begin with. Even, yeah, it's just a lot of conditioning going inside that's wanting the outside world to fix.

**Speaker A:** You. That's a good point. When we love somebody, that means that we make it her job or his job, in any case, one or the other. It's their job to fix me. I love you so much, give me what I want. I love you so much, it's up to you to make me happy. But in fact, that's what we mean kind of by ownership. That we begin to own someone. We cling to them. We grasp and hold to them. We become very selfish about it, which gives then the other person the quality of wanting to.

**Speaker B:** Escape.

**Speaker A:** We don't have the freedom because the other one is clinging too.

**Speaker B:** Much.

**Speaker H:** Dhammarato, I think love is a, like, a very charged word for people, but it sure is. A lot of that falls away with Jhana. Um, it surpasses love, it surpasses all those feelings. And you're like, oh, love isn't that magical of a feeling when you have like Jhana. And then it kind of levels out the feelings and you realize that there isn't as much of a, what is it like, discrepancy between them. It doesn't matter what the word is. Jhana itself is like the solution in a way.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, or at least several of the factors of the Jhana, that in fact if we have all of the five factors of Jhana, that puts it together in a kind of wholeness. But the important part, number one, over and over again this is listed in the Suttas, that the first thing you've got to do is to remove the unwholesome thoughts. And if you love somebody, That's an unwholesome thought. If you have them as a friend, then that would be a wholesome thought. And so this is the way that we would practice is stop loving things and be okay, already whole the way you are. You don't have to love something in order to feel good. In fact, you can feel really, really good by not having that negative quality to it. Because if you love something, you want to keep it. You got to hold it. You want it to stay. Well, this is easy enough then for Jhana. All you have to do is just come out of those unwholesome states back into the wholesome states, mostly and particularly to practice over and over again to apply the mind and sustain the mind into Sukkha, which is exactly opposite of Dukkha. Bring your mind into a state to where you feel safe and secure. Loving something puts you in danger of loss. Feeling safe and secure and uncomfortable— when people are in love, they're often uptight. And so if you can come to a state of safe and secure and comfortable, then you can be satisfied the way things are. And that's the state of being happy without having to get fulfilled, without having to get what you want in order to be happy. It's a hungerless happiness. Why is it hungerless? Is because we already have what we wanted. What did I want? To be free from desire. And I am. And so there's your Jhana right there, occasionally punctuated by that really, wow, that's so good, I love it! And now you're into that full-on first Jhana.

**Speaker H:** So Dhammarato, I do have a question on.

**Speaker I:** Jhana.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker H:** The Buddha, he, under the rose apple tree, he remembered that he entered Jhana when he was a.

**Speaker A:** Kid.

**Speaker H:** But he had learned the four arupa, the rupa, and the four arupa jhanas when he went into the ascetic life.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker H:** Were those four Rupa Jhanas he had learned, were they different from the Jhana as a kid?

**Speaker A:** And when he was— let's put it this way, just to give you a simple analogy, is once you have all of the factors of the first Jhana, the higher Jhanas is systematically, intentionally losing one of those at a time. Okay, so the second Jhana is systematically bringing the mind to a quiet state where we're not having wholesome thoughts anymore. And then the third Jhana is bringing that intense joy, that wow sensation that I was talking about, bringing that into a quiet peacefulness. And then the fourth Jhana is bringing that quality into a state of emptiness. Now actually, there's only four Jhanas. When people talk about Rupa and Arupa Jhanas, that's just because they don't know how to read suttas. There's only four Jhanas. And the problem that Siddhartha Gautama had was that he could not sustain that first Jhana. And that when— and then anybody who goes up into the higher jhanas, when they come out of Jhana, the place that they go is back into hindrances. But in fact, we could think of that the middle path is the middle path between the hindrances on one side, harming ourselves with our thoughts versus all of those higher jhanas, which has quite a lot of peace and quite a lot of bliss. And so you could say then that the real middle path is that first jhana. And that's the place to stay, is in that sweet spot, that middle path, to where you're not getting all those higher things, but that you're really, really well practiced so that you can come back into that first Jhana instantly or easily. Just take a breath and I'm glad I don't have to worry about that anymore.

**Speaker H:** So the Jhana that he learned from Arahant Kamma, it was that he just didn't think to stop at the first Jhana and sustain it.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker H:** Because they kept incrementing.

**Speaker A:** If he had stopped— isn't that the normal mind? The craving mind wants more and more and more and more and more. But really, first jhana needs to be sustained in the sense of becoming really satisfied with the first jhana. Because you can go into those higher jhanas, but you're not skilled now to be in the first jhana. And so when you come out of those higher jhanas, you're going to crash land back into Dukkha. So it's better to stay in that first jhana, which is being able to keep that state, the state of everything is all right, everything is fine, unremitting, keep coming back and coming back and coming back and coming back. That's the quality that the Buddha would teach. That's why he says that the first Jhana is the path. It's the middle.

**Speaker D:** Path.

**Speaker H:** Cool, thanks.

**Speaker A:** All right, so RJ, do you have something to say?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I think this is all very interesting. I'm quite new to this, but I think I get a lot of benefit in my daily life with all this.

**Speaker A:** Already. Yeah, it begins to change our mind, especially if you keep thinking about it and talking about it and practicing with other noble-minded people. It comes off, it rubs off. You get.

**Speaker G:** It? Yeah, and that's what's happening with me. I watch a lot of other videos of you as well during the week, so it's really helping me in my actual life. I can see it.

**Speaker A:** Impacting. Good. Congratulations. Keep at it. Keep at it over and over again. Keep.

**Speaker J:** Going.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Simon, do you have something to.

**Speaker J:** Say? Yeah, interesting topic. I have a quick question. Sometimes people talk about like the mother's love being like a real love versus like romantic love. I'm still a little confused because I have the idea in my mind about like mother's love being like a true feeling, like a true thing.

**Speaker A:** All right. Let us use a different language for just a second to help us out. One of the big beautiful qualities of the mother with her infant is what they call bonding, that she becomes at one with that child. She nurtures the child, she cares for the child. It is only after the child is the age 3 or 4 does she begin to love the child in the sense of now she wants the child to perform. But when the child is an infant, he could poop all over himself and mom's just fine with that. But that 4-year-old or that 16-year-old, he comes and craps on the carpet, Mom's going to have something to say, because she loves that teenager and she doesn't want him out there crapping on other people's carpets. That gives her a bad name. And so it's that early bonding that, in fact, that's of that example, is what I would recommend that you do with each other, that you do for yourself, that bonding, become whole, become integrated, become unified, that that's the way to live your life, as if you were caring for a tiny infant, you, and that you're not critical, you're not demanding, that love has a lot of criticism, a lot of demanding, a lot of other stuff built into it, to where this bonding quality is all nurturing all the time, all friendliness. And so this is the way that we would do it. Now they talk about it as motherly love, but as you can see, motherly love by just by the timetables of things happen, that love gets polluted, that the bonding is over. And now she loves that kid, and that's why she makes it go to school. It's because she's trying to control the kid. That's what we do with love. It's the attachment, it's a clinging. And so if moms would stop clinging to their children, stop loving them, they can just make best friends with them. Just be friendly with your kids. Don't expect anything out of them other than being happy with them. So does anybody else have any comments to make? Everybody's good, huh? How about you, Anna? You have something to.

**Speaker C:** Say? Beautiful talk, Dhammarato. Nothing to say.

**Speaker J:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right. Thank you. How about you.

**Speaker G:** Garantha?

**Speaker J:** I think that's me. Thank you, Dhammarato. It all makes a lot of sense, and I'm very happy about it.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right. Okay. Well, Mikey, why don't we take this thing.

**Speaker I:** Home? I'd love.

**Speaker A:** To. Bang, bang, bang. Yeah.

**Speaker I:** Thank you, friends, for being here today. And yes, Dhammarato was saying, and we'll echo here again, make good friends with each other here in this community online. It's a really wholesome space to do so. If you aren't currently, the encouragement would be to go ahead and start doing one-on-one calls with somebody. It can be with someone like me, Alex, Mr. Ben, Scott. There's all sorts of people here. Santiago, Anna, you know, Karwan. We've all made a lot of really worthwhile friendships here. So find someone. And pick someone new to pick new people to give a call and say, hey, you know what, I haven't talked to that person, but I've seen videos with them. And we're going to go ahead and start up a conversation.

**Speaker A:** Let's.

**Speaker I:** Really spread that friendship around. Also, we have sort of a new space set up for ladies in our server. So if you're a lady and you'd like to kind of chat with the gals, then let me know and we'll get you in.

**Speaker A:** There. Yeah, I think there's more than about 15 or so are already there. We don't know all of them, but Anna, I think Garantha is there and SwissBot, which is Samatha. I don't know about Christina, but I would recommend that the ladies, they go off to themselves and do as they please. Become friends, Dharma friends, good noble friends with one.

**Speaker B:** Time. Take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha (community) on a group call, focuses on two interconnected themes: the nature of **longing (Dukkha)** and the importance of **noble friendship (Sangha)**.

### **Core Teachings Summary:**

**1. The Nature of Longing (Dukkha):**
*   The talk begins by defining a key human trait: **wanting things we don't have**. This is identified as the essence of **Dukkha** (suffering, dissatisfaction).
*   Unlike animals, whose wants are simple and fulfillable, humans have developed complex, often unfulfillable longings.
*   This longing manifests in many forms, including **complaining** and making **comparisons**—both of which reinforce a state of dissatisfaction.

**2. The Antidote: Cultivating Satisfaction (Sukkha):**
*   The opposite of Dukkha is **Sukkha** (satisfaction, ease). Sukkha is described as a state of feeling **safe, secure, and comfortable**.
*   Satisfaction is binary—you either have it or you don't. The practice involves repeatedly letting go of unwholesome states and **returning the mind to a state of satisfaction**.
*   A key method is to stop feeding dissatisfaction (e.g., by complaining) and instead consciously cultivate wholesome thoughts and attitudes.

**3. The Central Role of Noble Friendship (Sangha):**
*   Dhammarato emphasizes that **friendship is not half, but the whole of the path**. A noble Sangha (community of practitioners) makes the Dhamma practice "whole" and sustainable.
*   The purpose of the community is to **mutually support each other in staying in wholesome, happy mind states**. It is not a place to vent or dwell in complaint.
*   Practicing with friends helps ingrain the Dhamma habitually, turning it from an occasional practice into a daily way of being.

**4. A Critical Distinction: Friendship vs. "Love":**
*   A significant portion of the talk is devoted to deconstructing the conventional concept of **"love."**
*   "Love" is presented as a form of **craving and clinging** that contains elements of control, jealousy, fear of loss, and neediness. It is seen as a source of Dukkha.
*   The recommended ideal is **noble friendship** or **kindness**, which is free from clinging, expectation, and the rollercoaster of possession and loss. It is about enjoying someone's presence without wanting to change or own them.
*   True companionship, even in marriage, is framed as evolving from "love" into a stable, caring friendship.

**5. Practical Application & Jhana:**
*   The practice is to **monitor speech and thought**, ensuring it promotes wholesomeness and friendship within the community.
*   This training leads towards **Jhana** (meditative absorption). The **first Jhana**—characterized by applied thought, sustained thought, joy, happiness, and one-pointedness—is highlighted as the sustainable "middle path" and the goal.
*   Achieving a hungerless happiness (Sukkha) through releasing craving is superior to the temporary happiness of getting what you want.

### **Key Takeaways for Practitioners:**
*   **Recognize longing** (wanting what you don't have) as the root of dissatisfaction.
*   **Cultivate satisfaction** by fostering feelings of safety, security, and comfort in the present moment.
*   **Prioritize noble friendship**. Actively engage with a Sangha to support and be supported in wholesome states.
*   **Transform relationships** from ones based on clinging "love" to ones based on selfless friendship and kindness.
*   **Guard your speech.** Use the community to practice wholesome communication, avoiding complaining and comparison.
*   **Aim for the first Jhana** as a state of stable, craving-free happiness that can be continually returned to.

The talk concludes with an encouragement to build one-on-one friendships within the community and to actively participate to deepen the practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a few key **stories** to illustrate the teachings on longing, friendship, and the nature of love.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Dog's Eyes:** The primary metaphor for longing. The image of a dog that wants something it cannot get on its own (like to go out, play, or be petted) represents the human condition of *dukkha*—wanting things we don't have and relying on external sources for satisfaction.
2.  **The Lion's Feast:** Used as a contrast. The lion hunts, eats its fill, and then rests contentedly for days. This represents a simpler state where desires are immediate, biological, and easily satisfied, unlike the persistent, complex longing of humans.
3.  **Hunger and Happiness:** A metaphor for two types of happiness:
    *   **Hunger-fulfilled happiness:** The short-term pleasure of getting what you crave (like sex or a possession). This is fleeting and leads to more craving.
    *   **Hungerless happiness:** The deeper satisfaction (*sukkha*) of being content without craving. This is the "real happiness" of being free from desire itself.
4.  **Complaining in the Rain:** A practical metaphor for choosing one's attitude. The example of going out in the rain and consciously choosing not to complain illustrates how we can practice shifting from a state of dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) to acceptance and even enjoyment.
5.  **Bonding vs. Loving (Mother & Infant):** The nurturing, non-demanding care of a mother for her infant is presented as a metaphor for ideal "friendship" or wholesome connection. This is contrasted with "love," which later becomes controlling and expectation-laden as the child grows.
6.  **The Middle Path as First Jhana:** The first *jhana* (a state of meditative absorption) is metaphorically described as the "sweet spot" or "middle path" between the suffering of hindrances and the rarefied but unsustainable higher *jhanas*. It's the place to learn to abide in sustained contentment.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Koko the Gorilla:** Referenced to support the idea that the trait of "wanting things you don't have" can be learned. Koko learned sign language and, in the process, also learned to desire things beyond immediate needs.
2.  **The Buddha and Ananda on Friendship:** The story of the "Half Sutta," where Ananda says friendship is half the spiritual path, and the Buddha corrects him, saying, "friendship is the whole path." This story underscores the supreme importance of noble friendship (*kalyāṇamittatā*) in the practice.
3.  **Personal Anecdote - "Can't get no satisfaction":** The speaker shares a personal story from his youth about seeking validation and love through sexual encounters, only to find that it never led to lasting satisfaction. This illustrates the futile cycle of craving.
4.  **The Buddha's Jhana Experience:** The story of Siddhartha Gautama remembering a spontaneous childhood *jhana* under the rose-apple tree and later learning meditative states from teachers is referenced. The key point drawn from the story is that his breakthrough was realizing the importance of *sustaining* the first *jhana* (the "middle path") rather than constantly seeking higher, more fleeting states.
5.  **Anecdote - "Don't you just love her dress?":** A mini-scenario used to deconstruct the word "love." The phrase is shown to often mask other unwholesome states like jealousy, pride, or indirect communication, demonstrating that "love" is frequently entangled with *dukkha*.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks (which act as extended metaphors)**

*   **Dukkha vs. Sukkha:** The entire talk contrasts these two states. *Dukkha* is metaphorically the state of the longing dog, the complainer in the rain, and the lovesick person. *Sukkha* is portrayed as a safe, secure, and comfortable satisfaction—the "hungerless happiness."
*   **Love as a Toxic Word:** The speaker frames the common concept of "love" as a dangerous container for clinging, fear, control, and ownership. He contrasts it sharply with the ideal of "friendship," which is presented as free, wholesome, and unifying.
*   **The Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha):** This is presented as the framework for practice, with a strong emphasis on *Sangha* (the community of noble friends) as what makes the path "whole."

In summary, the speaker uses relatable animal metaphors and personal and canonical stories to vividly contrast the suffering of endless human longing with the path to contentment, which is built on noble friendship, mindful speech, and sustained wholesome mental states.
