### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so this is Saturday morning here, Michael and I, and for everybody else it's Friday evening someplace in New York and Chicago. Brett, where are you located?

**Speaker B:** Located in Tennessee.

**Speaker A:** Tennessee, my goodness. Maybe I can get you to volunteer for the website.

**Speaker B:** If there's any skill, but it seems as though not a whole lot.

**Speaker A:** Um, actually, however, what we do need is, uh, something that doesn't require much skill but it's very repetitive, and that is that we've got a couple of thousand, um, uh, names and, uh, websites but we need photos and descriptions and perhaps addresses for those. And so Googling it and getting it, uh, getting to the website, finding photos, etc., like that is the kind of thing that we need mostly. The website is for, uh, almost all cases. We've already got all the pages that we want. There's some bugs and some stuff that needs to be fixed up, but right now all of my time is devoted to getting our data. And anybody can do that. It's a matter of, you know, click on this, Ctrl+C, change the page, paste that into the URL, see what Google has to say, click on that. Find an image, copy that, come back to the original page and paste it. That's the kind of stuff, you know, that kind of thing can get down to only 3-4 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so if you'd like, we can talk about that later. That's in fact what Michael is needing the laptop for, because I've used tablets and it's much easier to do it on a PC.

**Speaker B:** I have an extra laptop as well, so, and I wouldn't mind fitting shipping for that as well if you need that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, um, one thing that I want to mention is, is that on the, uh, the 9th of February, um, Steve, um, James and I will be doing another interview. Guru Viking, I think that you've seen some of those, and he reached out specifically to ask me the question about kind of being against formal sittings and formal meditation practices. And I wanted to introduce today's topic by talking about the fact that everything is a middle path, and that Western Buddhism tends to go overboard with the sitting practice, and that in fact the real issues is not while we're sitting. The real issues is can you take the skills that you're developing while you're sitting into your life. And that there's many examples of this, but basically what we really need to do with development of the teaching of the Buddha is to develop the attitude that everything is okay right now, and it's okay right now in both sides. In other words, the world is okay. Like it is, and I'm okay in that world. This is the kind of attitude that we need to come up with. This is in fact a restatement of the Buddha's point in the Haf Sutta, that the entire teachings of the Buddha, 100% of it, is about friendship. And yet I hear people being disappointed with this, that, and the other thing. An example of the disappointments is that, oh well, women are not really accepted into the Sangha very well. And the answer to that is that if someone is satisfied with the way things are, then we don't need to be making a lot of changes. And when things do change, We can handle that. And so in that regard, the Bhikkhuni Sangha for women has already been re-established, but it's not well known. It's not widespread. Well, I don't know what widespread means in the sense that right now there are more than 300 Bhikkhunis in Thailand, and there's couple of senior Bhikkhunis at Anagarhati. There's a nunnery in Southern California and all of that kind of stuff. So it's happening, but women are not satisfied with that. They want big. So this is one example. Another example is Noel was talking about that when he came to Thailand, he can see the same issues within Thai Buddhism that irks him about Islam, because he's living in Tunisia and he's pretty well disgusted with what's happening in the religion in Islam. And he sees the same selfishness and the same puffing one's ego up and the same kind of 'I'm the great guru' and all of that kind of stuff. He sees that in Thailand also. Now, whether that exists or not in reality, we don't quite know what his experiences are, but what we do know is that this is the way that his attitude is looking at it. So he's gotten kind of the attitude that all religion is bad, and that, that's, you know, it's the same issue in fact about the Bhikkhu Sangha or the Bhikkhuni Sangha and his issues with religions in general, and also each individual person meditating They're wanting something out of it, and we get dissatisfied from time to time. Oh, I'm not getting what I want out of my practice. Well, the thing of it is, is that everything is in flux. Everything is changing. There is always something you can find that you don't like, especially if you go looking for for it. The question is, can you find something that you do like, and would you go looking for it?

**Speaker B:** It's already here.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** It's already here.

**Speaker A:** It's already here.

**Speaker B:** It's already here.

**Speaker A:** Everything that we need is actually already here. Um, Years ago, in fact, not so long ago, only about 10 years ago, there was a whole lot of discussions going on. I think that there was some books written and that caused a lot of controversy, and then some more books were written, and then a whole hullabaloo came about atheism. Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and several others were pointing out that the Christian view of God is not conducive to freedom. But they were saying it in different ways. They were saying there is no God, and the reality is that reality exists. Realness is here, and we can do with it what we want to do. And some people can take reality and magnify it to the point that reality itself is God. This is in fact a good way of looking at it, that when you breathe in, you breathe in God, and when you breathe out, you breathe in marble. You breathe in, or you breathe out love, you breathe out energy, you spread your energy. This is a matter of an attitude. That we can develop, so that everything is already okay. But we have been in such a habit, and those habits that we have gotten have been trained into us from our parents and from our teachers, that in fact Western society is a society built upon dissatisfaction: "We've got to make it better, we don't have enough." And that we talk about rich and poor, and all of that, but in fact, everybody suffers because they want more. No matter how much money someone has, they want more. No matter how many clients someone has, they want more. No matter what meditation experiences that somebody has, they want more. Why is that? Because we have been trained in dissatisfaction. Now, when we were all about 3 years old, we could play because we already had everything that we needed. Our families supported us, we gave us food, they changed our diapers. And all of that. And so we can sit there and just be happy. But then Daddy and Mom comes along and they say, hey, we don't want you to be happy as a 3-year-old. We want you to join our society and start doing something. And then later Dad comes up, and I've had it. I know that almost everyone does have it. Dad wanted me to be the musician that he never was. He was in the Army in the US during World War II, and he was in a military band. And so he wants me to be in a military band so that he can relive and re-fulfill his life. So we train our children to want things, and what we train them to want is what we want. So if Dad wants something, he teaches his son to want that, so that if the son can get it, then Dad can get it too. And so we're trained into being dissatisfied and wanting to go get something. And so we bring that attitude to our practice of Anapanasati. We bring that practice to our religion. We bring that practice to whatever that we're doing, and that way we're not really making the progress that the Buddha talks about. Now, one of the points that we can say is that the Buddha's path is a change model, and yet you can see in what Western Buddhism has become, is an investigation model to look. They call it Vipassana, they call it insight. You got to take a look, you got to see what's there and get and see what's real. But often when we do that— pardon.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead— and then make a change.

**Speaker A:** And then we make it, then make the change. Exactly. But most of them don't make that change. They just do more investigation. That in fact, this is something that Anna may be interested in, that the label has been put on it is psychological archaeology. Now, Freud was actually quite big on developmental phases of children, developmental psychology. And nowadays, it's almost like the idea, "Oh, if we can go back to the original source, if we can find out what started the problem, then we can be free from it." But that's in fact not the case. Imagine that you were wearing handcuffs, or a better example would be that you're in a prison cell, and you've got bars there. And you can investigate those bars, you can investigate the floor, you can investigate the bed, you can investigate the toilet, and you can look and look and look and look, and know that cell very well, but that's not going to get you out of it. That in fact, wanting out of it is the problem. The question is, that if you are in a cell or whatever predicament that you're in, can you find a way of being satisfied with the way things are. That in fact, the cell that we're in is not the prison. The prison is in the mind, and we can change that mind. And this is so hard for people to understand. I've talked to people for years now, and the folks keep coming back with the same kind of issues, as if They've forgotten that they're already free. You can actually live in a prison and be free because the prison walls, the physical walls, is not your prison. The real prison is, is that, oh, you're here for punishment and you're supposed to not like it. You're supposed to hate it. You're supposed to want out. And so we all buy into that, to where in fact prison life sounds pretty good to me. You get 3 meals a day. If you're a monk and on Pindapat, you only get 1 meal a day. You have to go barefoot to get it. Then in fact, if you treat the guards in just the kind of way that they want you to treat them, They'll bring your food to your cell for you, lock you up in solitary confinement. But that sounds pretty good, you know? No hassles, no worries, no problems, no clocks, no calendars, just this moment, one moment after another, after another, for us to enjoy. This is the whole point of our practice now. Is to find a way of changing the mind from being dissatisfied with whatever circumstances that we find ourselves in, and recognize that this too, whatever circumstances that we're in, is actually our reality. And our reality is in fact our God, that that prison and the prison walls and the floor and all of that is supporting us. The air is there. Everything that we need in life, the best things in life in fact, are all free. And most of that has to do with our mental attitude. So the whole point is, can we change our mind? Yes, Anna.

**Speaker C:** But somehow I'm thinking that we're not supposed to like it, right? We're not supposed to dislike it, but somehow we don't like it. So we always need to be neutral. Or is it right thought or not?

**Speaker A:** Well, no way.

**Speaker C:** Like there's no requirement to like the present moment.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I think that this is something that is kind of misunderstood about Buddhism. In the sense that that feeling of neutrality is the outcome of the fact that we've enjoyed it. That a lot of people— let's look at a curve like this in the sense that coming from the bottom, coming from the nadir, up to zero, seems to be the mentality, and that I'm in a hole and I need to come up to zero. But if you know anything much about electricity and electronics and whatnot like that, we recognize that things don't stay at the nadir and they don't stay at zero. Everything is in a cycle. Everything is up and down and up and down and up and down, and nothing is actually neutral. Everything is in a wave. So the real balance is, is can you ride the wave no matter what part of the cycle it's in? This is also the point about Samskara, Samsara, that in fact you could say that Samsara is the word that Buddhism used 2,500 years ago for cycles. We know about electronic cycles, we know about electricity, we know that the Sun cycles, it's sometimes dark, sometimes light, that sometimes the wind is blowing, sometimes it's not, sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot. Everything is constantly changing, and the only thing, and in fact it seems not to change, is people's bad attitude. That's about the only thing that doesn't change. No matter what part of the cycle we're in, we don't like it. If in fact it's part of the cycle that we do like, then the thought will come in, oh no, it's not going to last. Oh no, tragedy is going to happen. We're going to go back. We're on the zenith now, but we're going back to the nadir. And so the question is, Can we find a way to learn to ride the waves, to deal with the fact that everything is constantly changing, and still be really okay with it, to appreciate it, that that's our environment, that's our reality?

**Speaker B:** It's beautiful.

**Speaker A:** This is the way that we have to start to practice. And this is a real change model, because we have been trained to have the opinion that whatever it is, it could be better. And yet we don't do anything to change, to make it better. Because really the only thing that needs to be done to make it better is our attitude. This is the real teaching of the Buddha. When the Buddha There's several places, I think that there's at least 4 suttas where the Buddha says that both formally and now, I teach only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Well, that Dukkha means the dissatisfaction that we don't like the way things are, that things are cycling, they're going back and forth and up and down, and I want peace and quiet. Well, actually, the peace and quiet would be to have fun riding that roller coaster rather than dreading it. So there's another way of looking at it, and that is that if you're going to come to a balance point, it's better to come to that balance point— let us say that you've got a kind of a field and that there's mountains and valleys around, and that it's better to coast from having climbed a hill. Yeah, we've climbed the hill, we've gotten to the top. Let us coast now down to the valley, as opposed to climbing up and then stopping. All right, in other words, if we come to zero from a minus place, that's a whole lot more hard work and effort and disappointments, etc., than if we come from a high number down to zero. Let your life become a downhill easy journey. This is the way that we're looking at it, is that Wherever your zero balance point is, you're coming to that zero balance by coasting, not by climbing. Find a way to coast in life, that everything is already okay, that gravity is there, that in fact— here's an idea that we can talk about for just a moment, and that is that you've heard that God is omniscient, he's every place, he's omnipotent, all-knowing. Well, if you look at it, physics is like that. The first example I will use is gravity, right? If you stumble, you'll fall because gravity will pull you down. Gravity is always there. Gravity is watching everything that happens. No time does gravity forget that if you drop a ball or if you let go of a ball, is it going to float in the air? No, gravity is going to be there. It's there all the time. So anything that you could think of that would be called a god in that regard, that's gravity. It's always there. It's always going to grab hold of you. It doesn't lose track of what's going on. Well, guess what? All of the four laws of physics are that way. The nuclear force, the strong, the weak, electromagnetic force always is in operation. That in fact, one of the things that I've learned recently is that even oxygen is affected by electromagnetic force, but we don't really know that. Because it's a gas, and because it's a gas, it's hard to see. But if you can put oxygen as a liquid, then you can see that in fact it's magnetic. So all of these forces are there all the time. This is what we could refer to then as God, that God is in fact real. Your reality is there all the time. The question is, is that what kind of relationship are you going to have to reality? If you're comfortable and happy and secure in your reality, then you're at that balance point. But the point about reality is, is that it's always there, but it's constantly changing. Everything keeps moving. Everything is up and everything is down. Can you hold your balance that way? So an example that I would use would be, imagine that a professor or a landlubber or someone like that has gotten on a big fishing boat to maybe do some research or whatever. Now the captain on that fishing boat has been on that fishing boat for years. And when the waves start to move and a little bit of a storm comes, the captain of the ship, he can keep his balance. He can go from the bow to the stern, back to the bow, and maintain his balance. But the college professor who has never been on board a big fishing boat like that, he's all over the place. He's not able to maintain his balance at all. He'll be banging into the cabin door, he'll be heaving over the side, he may even go over the side, because he doesn't have that ability to manage and to balance, that this is in fact a skill that the captain of the ship had to learn for himself. Now I use this example because I was in the Navy, and after I told this story one time, Tam and I needed to go to Koh Samui. We took the ferry over, but the weather was pretty rough. And even though that it's a big ferry, it was still going up and down and up and down and side to side and whatnot like that. And she was having a lot of trouble with it. And so I says, oh, well, one thing that I know about boats is that it will be easier if you go to the aft, that it's always forward that has to deal with the waves so much. And so we got up to go to the back part of the boat, and she was having a lot of trouble. She was banging into this chair and that chair and whatnot like that. But I remembered I've got to keep my balance, that I have to watch where the waves are moving the boat. And to learn to take the steps at just the right point so that I can maintain my balance. Well, this is actually what we need to learn in life, because life is very much like a ship where the deck is not solid, things are changing. That when people get old, they really, really want to get things to be exactly the way that they've always known it. So that they don't have to make any changes at all. If you've ever been around old people, you'll know that, that don't move their cup from that part of the table to the other part of the table. That you want it exactly the way that they remember it. I'm like that too now. When Piti comes to sit in my chair, she'll mistakenly unplug the mouse or she'll move stuff around or whatever like that. And when I come back, I say, 'Oh, Piti has moved something.' But look at the fact that it's me that doesn't like it, that I'm the one that wants to have things the way that they are, that they were, that they have been. And the reality is, is that things are not going to be the way that we want them to be. The better thing to have is the skill that, 'Oh, I can handle it.' no matter what happens. Yeah, I can plug the mouse back in and there's no problem. So this is the way that we can start to practice with our meditation, is this change model of coming out of our dissatisfactions, out of our disliking, out of our wanting to get something out of the practice, and start practicing actually being satisfied that this is good enough. I can handle this, this is okay, this is the skill that we need to develop. And then if we can develop that skill while we're sitting still, where there's, you know, we're in private, we're in seclusion, and that we still have this mind state that's going on, and we can come up with all kinds of things that we don't like, all kinds of things that need to be 'Can we change those thoughts into, yeah, it does need to be fixed, but I'm okay right now. Maybe I'll fix it later.' Michael, I hear your microphone. Very noisy. Yes, I can handle that. Okay, so let's take a moment and get some feedback on this. Aaron, does this fit in with what you were talking about earlier in the sense of wanting something out of your meditation?

**Speaker D:** Sort of. I get what you're saying in a sense that it seems It's more of a dance, you know, you adjust to whatever comes up. Now, there's a couple of things that comes up for me when I hear that is, you know, let's say if I get angry with something, I mean, I am not separate from life. So that anger also is part of what is. Me hearing this message is also part of what is. So I'm lucky in that regard. Then I'm thinking, okay, I'm assuming there is certainly a way to do, like you're saying, it's not that we don't do anything, we enjoy while we're doing things. Like when kids play, they're probably bored and they want to play, they want to do something, they want something else. So nonetheless, their play is more wholesome because it's sort of directionless. There's no greed in it. There's liking, but there's no wanting. And so I'm thinking, well, we can master things for sure. You know, you can master a piano, you can master some sort of a meditation, whatever, as long as it's playful, as long as you don't ruffle the feathers too much. I feel as long as you're not cannibalizing yourself increasing the energy too much, as you said, in physical systems. Maybe that's what skill is.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes, I agree that things are always in flux. The question is, can we handle that? And you mentioned anger. So We can understand that we get angry because we're dissatisfied. And yet, when we get angry, we're angry at something. We don't like that thing that happened, rather than recognizing that all really what's going on is that I have changed. I used to not be angry, and now I've gotten angry, so anger is there. Is that okay? If the anger is okay— yeah, I've gotten angry, that's okay— then we can get over it really easily. But it's possible for you to get angry at something and then get angry at yourself for getting angry, and it just stays in a cycle. But if we can accept that, oh yeah, I got angry, so what? Nothing to it. And forgive ourselves. I'm not really a big fan on using the word forgiveness because forgiveness is always from the outside. And also it has the quality of having something wrong that needs to be forgiven. As opposed to everything is already okay. So a way of thinking about it is that, yeah, I've gotten angry, but I can ignore that. I can just ignore it and everything is okay. So we begin to ignore the things that we don't like rather than dwelling on them and getting hot because they're not what we want. We can kind of ignore it. Oh well, doesn't matter. Nothing really matters anyway. The only thing that matters is, can I keep my homeostasis? Can I keep my balance? Can I keep my friendliness with the environment? But I don't have to be angry because something in the environment I don't like— that really, the not liking is the issue, not what really happened.

**Speaker D:** At what point is, if an emotion is too big and you don't have the equanimity for it, then you can get angry because you don't have the equanimity, then you're dissatisfied that you don't have the equanimity?

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. In fact, that's very common for beginners in meditation when they're given some instruction like to watch the breath, And then the mind wanders away from the breath. And Goenka would say, when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again, come back to the breath. But a lot of people, when they recognize that the mind has wandered away from the breath, they'll get really hard on themselves. They'll say, oh, you're supposed to watch the breath. Oh, you're not doing it correctly. And then they get worried. And this is not the real training that we're looking for. The real training is that it doesn't matter if the mind wanders away from the breath. Doesn't matter. What matters is, can you come back happily to it? Never mind, start again. So when you get angry out in life, we can say, never mind, start again. That this is the real point, is that can we develop a practice that works anytime that we can remember it? This is the change model, is that I can change the way that I feel, rather much easier in fact, than I can change reality. Like a war is on, I don't like the war. Well, I can't do anything about the war, but I can do something about it for myself, I can get out of the way. I can go find a place that's quiet, and I can be happy, contented, just the way things are. But if I don't like the war, then I'm going to get angry at the war, then I'm going to get angry at myself for getting angry at the war. And the reality is, is that we can't stop the war. But we can change our own mind. This is why the model is a change model, not just a Vipassana or an insight model. That yeah, we can do archaeology and find out where things come from, but that doesn't make it change. We have to make it change. We have to change our attitude. And the way that we change our attitude is by beginning. There's big attitude in the sense of an overall way of looking at it, but then there is very tiny little ones, niggles, just a little thing that moves us, sort of like a tree is going to fall in the direction that it's leaning And that woodchoppers, woodcutters, have learned that they can cut the base of the tree in such a way that it will fall exactly where they want it to fall. Well, can you do that with your own mind? Can you have your mind leaning in such a way so that when it falls, it's going to fall exactly where you want it to fall to? This is what we mean by the attitude. So if the attitude is this way, then it's going to fall that way. And that we can manage that with our language, that language is really, really powerful. The thoughts that we have. So if we have that quality of being able to gladden the mind, to be able to brighten the mind, to be able to change that little bit of an attitude, then we can manage how we feel. This is actually the way that Anapanasati is phrased, is that we do an investigation and then we make a change by gladdening the mind, brightening it up, changing the attitude of the mind. And we do that by changing the language that we're using. So, if I sit here in meditation saying, "Oh, I'm bored with meditation," then I'll have that feeling of boredom. But if I have the attitude of, "Oh, well, guess what? It's okay to be bored. That really is a good state to be in." Really, having nothing to do and no place to go, isn't that marvelous? And so we begin to cheer ourselves up with our boredom. Yeah, it's okay to be bored. But if we are dissatisfied with our boredom, then we're in that state of dissatisfaction. We want something, rather than being satisfied with the way things are. So we can do that with anger also. Yeah, I've gotten angry. Let me be satisfied with my anger and it'll dissolve. But if I keep wanting what I want and keep wanting it, then the anger is going to continue on. This is in fact why they talk about it in the sense of how long do you stay angry? Are you going to stay angry for 2 or 3 days? Can you get down to the point that you're only angry for a couple of hours? Then can you come down to the point that you're only angry for, let us say, 5 or 6 words? And then can you come down to just one word, like, oh, or ouch, or whatever? And then you see that anger and you say, okay, 'Never mind.' And pretty soon you got to the point that you're not even letting out that one scream. So this is the way that we could start to look at how we can change the way that we feel, is by monitoring it and recognizing that we can change. We've got an ability to do that. We can actually make friends with it. So yeah, most religion is, um, unuseful to society, but that's okay. I can get used to that. I mean, it's been that way my whole life, it's been that way before my whole life. I'm not going to be able to change religion, but what I can do is become satisfied that it's broken. It's okay that religion is all messed up. It's okay that I live in a prison. This is the way that things are really. We can handle anything like that, but one of the values, and in fact Michael is beginning to learn that being in Thailand and living in a wat, things are not the way that you're used to. Everything is new, everything is weird, okay? And all you have to do is to be able to handle the weirdness. I'm okay with this, I'm okay with that. That Kat was going through that when he was there also. That he would get into, "Oh, well, I don't like that they do this at the Wat," and, "Oh, I don't like it if they do that at the Wat," rather than recognizing, "Oh, your job really is to be okay with whatever's happening." If we've got a bad president, that's okay, because you can't change presidents. You can't do it. We can't, we're in the soup, we're not the cook. And what we can do instead is enjoy being part of the soup. Mike was just sending a message about the Bhikkhuni. I wish that he'd join us here. So anyway, Brett, do you have any comments to make?

**Speaker B:** The process you described previously of ascertaining moment-by-moment dissatisfaction and making a change That's what I understood the word Vipassana to mean.

**Speaker A:** I know, but that's in fact the Buddhist version of Vipassana. But in fact, here's a funny little point, is that the word Vipassana is not even a common word in the suttas. You will find the word Vipassana more commonly in braces or brackets where the translator has put it in there, that it doesn't really exist. And in fact, you've probably known that the Vipassana people who call themselves Vipassana people, they're very much in love with the Satipatthana Sutta. And yet in the Satipatthana Sutta, the word Vipassana doesn't appear, never. Except as subject headings that the translators have put in there. And the word Vipassana then would be overly used in the sense of you've got to go deep, you've got to really understand it deeply. So you look at this dukkha and you see this dukkha is like that dukkha, and then you put them together as double dukkha, and then you go down the dukkha rat hole And this is not what the Buddha teaches. What he teaches is, if you can see it as Dukkha, do something about it immediately. You don't have to investigate it. You can just see it, that's the investigation, is to see that, "Oh, I'm dissatisfied, I don't like that, let me change my dissatisfaction back into satisfaction." [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Right.

**Speaker B:** But we don't become obsessed with the investigation itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the investigation is only in order to be able to tweak it, to make a change to it.

**Speaker B:** Step 2, like Ajahn Thanissaro says, mindfulness 2.0. So 1.0 is non-reactivity at the senses, but that's not the whole game. 2.0, make a change.

**Speaker A:** Make a change to change whatever attitude that you have into something more wholesome. So Michael, do you have something? Oh, wait a minute, Emran. Go ahead, Emran.

**Speaker D:** So concerning Vipassana, you know, sometimes it's not necessarily Dukkha. What I find useful is if I'm breathing and thought comes up, And so, oh, where did that come from? From here. That's a sensation. From here, that's another sensation. Here, another sensation. So in that sense, it's nothing bad, but it helps with the insight of, you know, there is no me. It's just okay, just like whatever comes into sensation.

**Speaker A:** That's correct. Things are changing constantly. Can you Be okay that things are changing constantly. The way you feel changes, the thoughts that you have are changing. You can get angry. Can you be satisfied with, yeah, it was okay, I got angry? Everything is all right. Go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker B:** And furthermore, if a practitioner, or if someone in their practice, if a practice truly grasps the quality of Anatta or the Lakshana of not-self, how could there be a dark night of the soul? That couldn't be. It's unless one's clinging to craving still, only then. And otherwise, it's an illusion. It was never there. No chains.

**Speaker A:** Yes, wanting something. The question is, is who wants.

**Speaker B:** Who.

**Speaker A:** Is it that wants something? And the answer to that is actually there is no one who wants, there's just wanting. And so we can just change that wanting into, I'm okay, I don't have to want something. That in fact, this is all what the Second Noble Truth is really all about, is wanting something ignorantly, in the sense of I want it. I want this, and I want that, and I want to get rid of this, and I want to get rid of that. And the reality is, is that there is no wanter. There's just wanting, which makes it really easy to change. We can change it immediately into I'm okay, I don't have to want anything.

**Speaker D:** And just to add to it, there is also no meditator, there is meditating that can change the wanting. Can be sneaky.

**Speaker A:** Yes, actually that's the key point that I'm trying to make, is that why do people meditate? Because they want something. Isn't that weird that really the correct practice is to come out of wanting. And so the only time that we need to meditate is when we want something. And yet, the way that it's practiced and taught, it's done on a schedule, it's done in a certain place, it's done at a certain time, it's got certain features. You've got a meditation hall, all of that kind of stuff. And so we kind of think that meditation has all of this formality around it. But the Buddha didn't ever say, go to a retreat. He never said, go to the meditation hall. That's not what he said. What did he say? Go to the woods, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, sit down. Then actually it's a bad translation when it says sit cross-legged. In fact, the actual Pali word is sit on a sitting place. So a couch or a bench or a chair is a sitting place. And so you can sit on anything, just be comfortable. The whole point about it is, is that we need to learn to be comfortable with the body. So that we can then assist ourselves into being comfortable in the mind, to be comfortable wherever you are, no matter what's changing, etc., like that. But when people go to the retreat, when the bell rings and it's time to go to the meditation hall, almost everyone goes to the meditation hall begrudgingly. Oh, I don't feel like it. Right now. Oh, I'll go because I'm supposed to. Very few people are eager to go sit in meditation. Why? Because they hadn't been practicing correctly the moments and two moments before the bell rang. If we were in a state of deep satisfaction, everything is okay, then when the bell rings, we can just continue with our satisfaction as we go to the meditation hall. And what are we going to practice in the meditation hall? Maintaining that being satisfied with what's happening right now. This is the real practice. It's subtle, it's profound, it's deep, it's hard for people to understand that the real practice is to become satisfied with the way things are. Right now, whether we're in the meditation hall, on the way to the meditation hall, leaving the meditation hall, or going to the forest, or whatever we're doing, can we be in a state of satisfaction that this is okay? If somebody's yelling at me, yeah, that's okay. If nobody wants to be around me, yeah, that's okay. So whatever happens learn to be okay with it. This is the satisfaction. Now what happens when that satisfaction happens over and over and over again? We begin to become surprised because we have been in the habit of being dissatisfied so often that we don't experience satisfaction very much. And so when it begins to happen, we get that kind of a wow sensation. Wow, this is good enough. Well, I am satisfied. Now that wow, that peak moment doesn't last, but it certainly is part of the process. This is in fact the Pali word for Piti, is that wow sensation. I can do this. Piti, Sukkha, Anagami, and be satisfied. Go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker B:** A Piti Sukkha party.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a Piti Sukkha party is that, hey, I'm okay. This is already okay. I have arrived at no place because there's no place to go, but I have arrived there at least right now. I might leave it later, but I can come back. That there is a sutta number 48, the Kansambhian Sutta, where the Buddha talks about that the first step of the real practice, you could actually say the first step of Srotapanna, is to develop that attitude that no matter how obstructed my mind gets, no matter how angry I become, no matter what frustrations or whatever, I know I can come back out of it. I'm not stuck there. I don't have to be frozen in that anger. I can drop it and I can come back to the reality of the situation and see things like the way that they really are. That's the real practice, is not that we get sidetracked or we lose it. It's that attitude that, oh yeah, but I can drop that and come right back into this state of satisfaction. 'Wow, isn't that nice? That's marvelous that I can just be satisfied just by changing my attitude.' And if my butt hurts, okay, yeah, the butt hurts. Let's take care of the butt. The butt needs something, and so let me take care of it. But I don't have to be frustrated and sad, 'Oh, I don't like it.' I could just, 'Okay, so the butt hurts.' This is the whole attitude that we have to practice. This is a simple thing, but the Buddhist practice is simple. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha means to come, that we're in our state of dissatisfaction, I'm angry and I don't like it, into, okay, well, anger is there, but I'm okay with it. And when I become okay and satisfied with being angry, guess what? It just disappears. In fact, it's kind of a joke. But look, I was angry because I was dissatisfied. Now that I'm satisfied, where's the anger going to have a foundation? It's not. It's going to float away. It's going to disappear. There's nothing really to it.

**Speaker B:** So— It never had any substance.

**Speaker A:** Say what again?

**Speaker B:** It never had any substance.

**Speaker A:** It never had any substance. All it had was our dissatisfaction. It was always mental all along. So, Michael, do you have something to say about this?

**Speaker E:** Yes, when you were talking about balancing on the boat and talking about balancing as applying it to the practice. I think that's just very applicable to all of what the Buddha teaches, and in particular about the Buddha, Dhamma being about friendship. I was thinking, if you meet someone and you try to be too loving, or let's say you try to hug them before even knowing their name, they might push you away. So when you're making friends with people, there's kind of a balance to learning how to get close with them. And the same is true when you're making friends with yourself too.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's what we have to do. That's the whole idea of the friendship— become nurturing. You see, we are mostly trained to be critical with ourselves, that all this is not good and all that needs to be fixed, and that kind of mentality. But we can't treat a tender infant that way. When, let us say, a 6-week-old baby, we can't fuss at the child because he pooped in his diaper. In fact, we don't even want to give the child a bad feeling about it. We want to be playful with the tender infant. That mothers, in fact, they have that motherly instinct, but they lose it by the time the child is 4 or 5. 5 years old, mother loses her motherly instincts and she becomes a parent instead, fussing at the child, criticizing the child, wanting the child to be better, etc., like that, rather than accepting the child the way that it is. And so that happens to every one of us. Mom goes through a big change that might in fact help happen a lot If we're the older child and mom has a new baby, now she's going to put all the nurturing on the new baby. And Johnny, who used to get all the nurturing, now he's mama's little helper. He's got to be put to work. This is what happens with all of us, that we're put to work. We lose that nurturing and we lose the ability to nurture ourselves. Ourselves. So what we need to do is to come back with that nurturing, everything's all right, everything is okay, everything is fine. And as I said, pretty soon when we get into that rhythm of everything is okay, we begin to get that wow sensation. Wow, I can feel okay. I can control my mind. To come back out of my misery into everything's all right, everything's fine, no worries. And so we have to practice that. Now, when do we practice? We don't necessarily just practice it in a formal meditation session, but that would be good if we're doing those things to practice that then, rather than investigating and trying to out the root causes of things and worrying about why I can't get over it and all of that, is to just keep coming back to everything is okay, everything is fine. And then when we get up from that meditation, now that we have made friends with ourselves, we've nurtured ourselves, we can go nurture the entire world like that. That yeah, the world is stuck, yeah, the world is broken, so What? I'm still having a ball here, folks. This is the attitude that we can pick up, but we have to practice that. Practice, practice over and over again. Everything's okay, everything is fine. Why? Because look how often and how much practice over the years that you put into making things a mess. Not making the mess yourself, but calling whatever is there a mess, calling it, it needs to be fixed. Oh, you need to do your homework. Well, why can't I just enjoy doing the homework? Why do I have to need to do it? Why can't we start to enjoy our lives? Because we're not taught that. We're taught that things are broken and they need to be fixed, and you got to go do it. And we don't care whether you like doing it or not, so long as it gets done. So in reality then, that becomes more important than how we feel. So here the whole practice is learning how to feel the way that you want to feel. And when you get good at feeling the way that you want to feel, you can feel that way towards everything. A broken world is just a broken world. That's okay. We don't deny that it's broken, we just recognize, yeah, it's okay that it's broken. Go ahead, Brett. Um, you made a motion that you had something to say.

**Speaker B:** It has fallen from my mind, and that's Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay. Okay, well, Michael, good to see you.

**Speaker F:** Good to see you as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we were just about to finish up here.

**Speaker F:** Oh, okay, good. Yeah, I have like 2 minutes. I just wanted to come by and say hello.

**Speaker A:** Well, hello.

**Speaker F:** How's everybody doing?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm really okay with the fact that you came late. That's all right with me. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** I was actually at Costco when you guys started the call, so.

**Speaker A:** So does anybody have any final words? Dhamma Das, do you have something to say? No, thank you, but thank you so much for your teachings, and I really appreciate it. Yeah, satisfying. So how about you, Anna? You okay? You're all right, good. Everything is fine. Yeah, let's try to keep that attitude going, and when we don't have it going, that's okay too. It's okay when you get angry, it's okay when you mess up. Keep track of the fact that you can continue to nurture yourself. If you become critical of yourself because you're angry, now you've got two problems. But if you can nurture yourself while you're angry, then that nurturing will solve the issue of the anger, and then you've got nothing left and everything is okay. Back to homeostasis. Everything is all right, everything is fine. So this is the practice, that everything is all right, everything is fine. And when you do that, pretty soon that wow, everything really is okay— Arahant, everything actually is okay, isn't that marvelous? Everything is okay. So, Michael, I would like for you to come over tomorrow.

**Speaker E:** Okay, I'm over.

**Speaker F:** Oh, different Michael.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Many Michaels in the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, yeah, Michael Clark. Sorry.

**Speaker F:** A long, a long, uh, multi-vehicle trip for me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, does anybody have any final things to say? Nothing? All right, everybody's satisfied, everybody's okay. So we'll see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a core theme: **shifting from a mindset of dissatisfaction and wanting to one of acceptance, satisfaction, and skillful adaptation to life's constant changes.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Problem: The Habit of Dissatisfaction**
*   Western society and our upbringing train us to be perpetually dissatisfied. We are taught to want more, fix things, and believe the present moment isn't good enough. We bring this "wanting" attitude to meditation, spirituality, and life, which hinders real progress.

**The Buddha's "Change Model" vs. "Investigation Model"**
*   Dhammarato contrasts two approaches:
    1.  **Investigation Model (Common in Western Buddhism):** Endlessly analyzing problems (like "psychological archaeology") to find their root cause. He compares this to studying every detail of a prison cell but never getting out. Insight (*Vipassana*) alone is not enough.
    2.  **Change Model (The Buddha's Path):** The immediate practice of **changing your mental attitude** from dissatisfaction to satisfaction. The moment you notice discontent (*dukkha*), you actively work to gladden the mind and accept things as they are.

**The Practice: Cultivating "Everything is Okay"**
*   The essential skill is learning to be **satisfied with the present reality**, regardless of circumstances. This doesn't mean passivity, but changing your relationship to experience.
*   **Examples:** Being okay with boredom in meditation, being okay with anger when it arises (and then letting it go by not fueling it), being okay with imperfections in religions or society.
*   This is framed as making **friends with reality**. When you are friendly and nurturing toward yourself and your experience, dissatisfaction loses its foundation.

**Key Metaphors and Illustrations:**
*   **Riding the Waves:** Life is constantly cycling like waves—ups and downs, pleasure and pain. The skill is learning to ride these waves with balance, like a seasoned ship captain in a storm, rather than fighting them.
*   **The Prison of the Mind:** Physical limitations (a prison cell, a bad situation) are not the real prison. The prison is the mental attitude of "this shouldn't be happening" and "I must get out." Freedom is an internal state of acceptance.
*   **Nurturing the Infant Self:** We must relearn to nurture ourselves with the kindness a mother shows an infant, rather than with the criticism and demands we internalized from parents and society.

**Application to Meditation and Daily Life:**
*   Formal sitting practice is not about achieving special states, but about practicing this attitude of satisfaction in a quiet setting: "This is good enough. I can handle this."
*   The real test is taking this skill **off the cushion** into daily life—dealing with frustration, weirdness, injustice, or discomfort with the mantra: "It's okay. I can handle this."
*   The goal is **homeostasis**—a balanced, flexible mind that can return to "okay" quickly after being disturbed.

**Conclusion:**
The talk is an invitation to a profound but simple shift: stop trying to fix reality to match your desires, and start fixing your attitude *toward* reality. The path is one of **self-nurturing friendship**, leading to the discovery that "everything we need is already here." The ultimate freedom is realizing that dissatisfaction is a mental habit that can be dropped, revealing a baseline state where "everything is okay."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about dissatisfaction, meditation, and changing one's attitude. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Prison Cell:** The speaker compares investigating one's problems without making a change to being in a prison cell. You can study the bars, floor, and toilet in detail (psychological archaeology), but that investigation alone won't free you. The real prison is the *mindset* of wanting to escape and being dissatisfied. Freedom comes from changing your attitude to be satisfied even within the cell.
2.  **Riding the Waves / The Ship Captain:** Life is compared to a ship on rough seas, constantly moving. An inexperienced person (the college professor) is thrown off balance, while the seasoned captain has learned to adjust his steps and maintain balance. This metaphor illustrates the skill of maintaining equanimity and satisfaction amid life's constant changes and cycles (Samsara).
3.  **The Roller Coaster:** The cyclical nature of experience is likened to a roller coaster. The goal isn't to stop the ride (which is impossible) or to dread the lows, but to "have fun riding that roller coaster." Peace comes from enjoying the entire cycle, not craving only the peaks.
4.  **Coasting Downhill vs. Climbing Uphill:** Achieving a balanced, satisfied state ("zero") is better approached by "coasting" from a positive state rather than laboriously "climbing" from a negative one. The idea is to cultivate an attitude where life feels like an easy, downhill journey because you start from the premise that "everything is already okay."
5.  **Gravity / Physics as God:** The speaker uses the laws of physics (gravity, electromagnetic force) as a metaphor for a god-like principle: an omnipresent, consistent, and dependable reality. The point is that "God" or ultimate reality is always here—it's the constant backdrop of change. Our relationship to this reality (accepting or fighting it) is what matters.
6.  **Felling a Tree:** The mind is compared to a tree. A woodsman cuts the tree so it falls in the direction it's already leaning. Similarly, we can cultivate ("lean") our mental attitude in a specific direction (towards satisfaction) so that our thoughts and reactions naturally "fall" into wholesome patterns.
7.  **The Soup:** We are not the cooks of life's circumstances ("the soup"); we are merely in it. Since we can't control the soup (global events, others' actions), the skillful response is to "enjoy being part of the soup" rather than railing against its ingredients.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Father and the Military Band:** A personal story about how the speaker's father, who was in a military band, wanted his son to fulfill his own unmet dreams. This illustrates how dissatisfaction and specific desires are socially conditioned and passed down through families, training us to always "want more."
2.  **The Ferry to Koh Samui:** A personal anecdote where the speaker and a companion (Tam) were on a rough ferry ride. The companion struggled with balance, while the speaker (drawing on Navy experience) consciously timed his movements with the waves. This story concretizes the "ship captain" metaphor, showing the practical application of finding balance in instability.
3.  **Old People and Routine:** The observation that elderly people often insist on things being exactly in their place (a cup, a chair) is used as a story to highlight the human craving for stability and resistance to change. The speaker contrasts this with the adaptable skill of saying, "Oh, I can handle it," when something is moved.
4.  **The 3-Year-Old Child:** The speaker references the natural state of a young child who is happy and satisfied because their needs are met. This is contrasted with the moment parents begin socializing the child into the culture of "doing" and "wanting more," thereby implanting the seed of chronic dissatisfaction.
5.  **The Baby with a Dirty Diaper:** This story emphasizes the "nurturing" attitude we must relearn toward ourselves. We wouldn't criticize a 6-week-old baby for soiling itself; we'd care for it tenderly. Similarly, we should meet our own anger or failings with nurturing acceptance, not criticism, to allow those states to dissolve.

### **Central Narrative**
Woven through these metaphors and stories is a **core contrasting narrative**:
*   **The Common Model:** A life (and meditation practice) based on **investigation and dissatisfaction**—always looking for what's wrong, seeking more, and treating meditation as a formal, goal-oriented task.
*   **The Proposed Model:** A life based on **change and satisfaction**—using simple awareness to see dissatisfaction and immediately "changing the channel" of the mind to an attitude of "everything is okay right now." This turns practice into an informal, continuous nurturing of friendliness towards the present moment.

The metaphors and stories consistently serve to make this abstract "change model" tangible, memorable, and relatable.
