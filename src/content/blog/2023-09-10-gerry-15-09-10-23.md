### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Arya. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I got a little boo-boo on the nose here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. So anyway, this Theravada group that I have not contacted, I mean, the minute I saw that they they have their meetings which they start with chanting. I think, oh my God, no, I'm not going to chant. That's religious.

**Speaker B:** That's an interesting point. Why would you think that chanting would be religious?

**Speaker A:** Because I did a fair amount. I didn't. Yes, I had to do some in my school days. I had to do the plain chant.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Well, here's a question, an alternate question. Does everything that a religion do, is it wrong? Or is it possible that sometimes religions do something that's correct?

**Speaker A:** They do quite a lot that's correct. I mean, they are. I hand it to them, the Roman Church, I hand it to them. They do a lot of good for the poor and that kind of thing. They may be an element of rice Christianity about it, you know, come to our services and we'll give you a free meal. But, you know, but they do have, they do do some good that way. They do do quite a lot of good that way. And if I were seeking Well, put it this way, I have on occasion sought to hand over, you know, used stuff like used luggage and stuff to groups that collect in the name of giving it to the poor.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm getting on about the whole point about the chanting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I would think that Christianity would be, and over the long haul would have been, much more advantage if they would have chanted what Jesus said. Take— I mean, you've heard of red-letter editions of the Bible. Why don't the churches start chanting together the red letters in their Bible? If they would do that, then it would come into them in the sense that Christianity has gotten far, far away from the teachings of Jesus.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah, but what this chanting was that I was doing as a child, as a boy in school, was the plain chant. They were chanting the Psalms in Latin.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's not going to do you a whole lot of good unless you learn Latin.

**Speaker A:** It's although one phrase has stuck with me, Kadenta Latere. Hang on, I'll chant it for you. Kadenta Latere, tu Omile et etcha Miliad ex Christo. No, that means that is, but it.

**Speaker B:** Doesn'T matter what it means. I got it. Let's, let's ask this question though. Do you not think that by you learning that, that you help develop your mind?

**Speaker A:** Oh, yeah. Oh yes. I mean, that is memory. That is, that is good that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's called Memory. That's one of the advantages of those cultures that their education system is all about chanting. I Madrassas, many of them do nothing but teach the kids how to memorize the Koran.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** Which in a way teaches people how to gain a photographic memory. All right, so there are some advantages. This is one of the things that I have talked to the various students who go to the Wat, and they hear the chanting and they want to know what the value of the chanting is. And the answer is, is that for kids it really helps develop the mind. For adults, the same thing is true. Also, if you know what you're chanting, it helps to remember, revive, and open up, just like I was talking about. If they would chant what Jesus said, but they don't. They spend more time, in fact, in Paul, Revelations, the Old Testament. And all of that kind of stuff rather than hanging in there with what Jesus said.

**Speaker A:** But Jesus said some weird stuff like, like you rock up, you rock up at sort of an hour from sunset to do a job and the master pays you for the whole day and that sort of thing.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I didn't quite catch that.

**Speaker A:** That's the parable of the, of the, the guy who, the master who is paying his workers for a day's work and people come on late on the job, late in the afternoon and they get paid the same money and this annoys the workers who have had to slave all day for the job, on the job.

**Speaker B:** All right, here's the point. Don't take that literally, that there is a metaphor in there and that is that we're all alive, that the wages that we have gained is The basis is that we're alive, and we all get paid the same wages, but some people have short lives and some people have longer lives, but we all stay alive. And so, putting in a shorter day is what they agreed to. The guys who are saying, "I agreed to getting so much money for a full day's wage," And now who am I angry at because somebody else got a better deal?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, fair enough, but there we are.

**Speaker B:** That's like saying that the guy who gets paid for a particular job, the guy next to him makes more money than he do. That happens in law firms, it happens in fact in a lot of corporations that are called merit-based, that you're not supposed to know what other people are making because it only causes jealousy.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** So that's the teaching that Jesus was giving there in that parable. But the point that I'm making is, is that what Jesus said is almost never listened to. And yet in Buddhism, what we're chanting is actually, though it may be in Pali, it's an invitation to learn some Pali so that we can do a better job of understanding what the Buddha said rather than relying upon other translators who have their own axe to grind. And so I'm not against chanting, but I was when I started doing it. And in fact, I was really happy at Wat Suwan Mokkh that almost no one who was a full resident of Wat Suwan Mokkh went to the chanting. The only ones who did the chanting were foreign visiting monks. But when I got with Maha Samsara in Wat Greensboro, I changed my mind with him because he first off studied under one of the world's best chanters at Wat Pho. In fact, his mentor was the Thai monk who went to Burma for the Sixth World Council in 1954, '55, '56. And over a 3-month period of time, this monk chanted the entire Tripitaka.

**Speaker A:** Whoa.

**Speaker B:** Now, when we start chanting, we say, wow, it would be really hard to learn one sutta. But if you've learned one sutta, the second sutta is easier. The third sutta is even easier than that. And pretty soon you get in the role of being able to remember things. And that's why you have a few world experts. I mean, humans can do this kind of stuff. He wasn't the only one, by the way, at that conference who did that in an opposing hall, or maybe at a different time. A Burmese monk also chanted the entire Tripitaka, and all the audience was sitting there with their— what kind of book they had in either Thai or Burmese script to follow along, to make sure that the guy got it word for word as well as that. Okay, but only people who were being interested in chanting would have bothered to go to such things. And so, we can see that there is value in the chanting. But you originally called about a guy who was not religion, and said that, "Why would you go out of one religion that in fact was quite damaging to you, into another religion?" Is that part of what we opened this up with?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] That is what we opened this up with.

**Speaker B:** OK, so let's go down that one for a little bit. In fact, my one-liners as you were speaking, we can repeat and put into context, that in fact, many, many people in the West will see meditation as a word, meditation, that they associate with religion, especially the Catholic Church. That in fact, in many of the places that I know of, they will use words like Vespers or meditations as written things down, things to meditate upon, or to figure out, contemplate in that way. And so meditation has historically been a contemplation, like contemplating the Trinity or contemplating the compassion of Mother Mary, or Those are the various things. And so what we're doing here is a mental development. It's a training for the mind, and it's not meditation. But somehow or another, the word meditation has been stuck on to all kinds of things that are not actually within the context of meditation. But I can appreciate that what he was saying was, for you, he sees that you've joined a religion after having been damaged by one. You've joined another religion. And I would say that if the new religion that you join is damaging also, at least now you're older and old enough to figure out the damage when you see the damage flying towards you without actually having to get wounded by it over and over again. So I would recommend that any group that you join, you check them out. Is this place damaging, or is this place going to be more wholesome for me? And from what I've gathered, your, let us say, interest in forays into Buddhism have led you to good results, not being damaged by it?

**Speaker A:** Well, this is entirely true. I mean, I have— this is going to lead me on to things that I will ask you about practice, actually. But yes, yes, the results I see as as good. And but I mean, I do not. I would— I say to people now, I follow a Buddhist meditation practice, I said, but I don't identify as a Buddhist.

**Speaker B:** Well, why don't you then, instead of using the word meditation and perpetuate that falsehood, why don't you call it mental development?

**Speaker A:** Because that's what people understand, because meditation—.

**Speaker B:** I know, but they will understand it wrong. And you can help them get that straightened out, that this is actually a practice of mental development. And in fact, you could go so far as to use the word mindfulness because mindfulness is a very common word now that's used, and it's certainly a better word than meditation.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but that again, mindfulness, he seems to come with its own baggage. I mean, it's seen as— Boy, it.

**Speaker B:** Sure does, doesn't it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. No, go ahead. Going on to actual practice, I mean, this may be Well, I'm really— well, I find myself— the exercise that you talk of, of remembering, what I seem to be remembering as much as anything at the moment from time to time is the fact that I can do I can get into the first Jhana. Okay, I remember that and it pretty much progresses from there.

**Speaker B:** The question arises— And congratulations for that.

**Speaker A:** Well, thank you. But the— or it doesn't always, but sometimes the hindrances are too strong, especially doubt. But Various things. I mean, well, things that do. Well, no, I need— I'm sorry, I'm trying to get my— what in order, what I want to say. First of all, there is this idea that there is this— we can call it a memory. I've called it the sort of trigger or whatever that sets me off going down that route. And there is a tendency to think of this as some kind of stable existing thing in the mind, which I take it that it cannot be because everything is conditioned. And this must also be conditioned. It is not. I'm not sort of contacting the eternal or cosmic consciousness or something like that. That sort of exists out of time and space.

**Speaker B:** You're not contacting anything on the outside, you're contacting something on the inside.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so the cosmic consciousness is within the mind, it's not out there someplace in the cosmos.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But then it's only a thing in the mind that is conditioned by one having a mind.

**Speaker B:** You know, right? But that's a wholesome, healthy condition that the mind exists in order for you to have other conditionings. But some of the conditionings are wholesome and some of them are unwholesome. Much of what you got out of the Catholic Church was not wholesome for you, but some of it was. Yeah, like for instance, you remember, you're okay. So let us say that there are various kinds of memory, or to remember. For instance, you can remember the chants, or we can remember songs, we can remember sequences of events. Some coders can remember code. Yeah. Okay. Now there's another kind of memory, which is just a memory of the past, which is related to that. But we reminisce, and then we find, then we will stumble into reminiscing about something that brings not good feelings, but bad. And so remembering and reminiscing about the past is kind of dangerous, to where remembering a song or remembering a chant is not so much danger, it took in fact some skill. Now there's another kind of remembering, and that is the remembering to do something in the future. But the one that we're really looking at is the one to remember to wake up into the present moment, to remember to be here now, to remember to come out of our old memory systems and to come into the present moment. So in a way, we're saying that we're developing the memory to forget all the things that we remember and pay attention to new input. So that's the kind of memory that we call mindfulness, except that mindfulness is not a good translation of this. What the original Pali word was, was Sati. Yeah. And that often I use the translation of Sati to be wakey wakey, wake up to this present moment, to be here now. And that is training, because we have been trained to remember things in the past. We have been trained to be able to remember long sequences of words. I mean, I'm pretty good at that. Not as good as you as a Latin, but I've got several things like Once Upon a Midnight Dreary, while I wondered weak and weary upon the tales of forgotten lore. Now that's American, not British, so you probably you're not going to remember that one. But I can go, I can go all the way through. 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, and not a creature was stirring. Not even a mouse. The stocking was hung by the chimney with care, and hoped that Saint Nicholas would be there. When, nigh on the kerchief and nigh on my cap, we just settled down for a long winter's nap, when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. The dew on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave luster of midday, when one the object below. And what to my wondering why should appear but a miniature sleigh and 8 tiny reindeer? And I can go on, I mean, I've already gotten about half of it done. But the point is, is that while I'm saying that, I'm having a lot of fun in this present moment. And I remember to do that, that it's not just a matter of trying to remember it, it's a matter of the presentation and everything, and all the good gushy feelings that we have about this present moment, that that's where it's all about. And this is the training for Anapanasati. It's not a long deep breath, it's this long deep breath. That's the whole point of it. And this is a training that very few people go through, even those Buddhists who call themselves meditators. They're not training themselves to wake up and be here in this present moment. And we're using words like mindfulness and meditation, often get in the way of what we really need to be doing, which is wake up and smell the coffee at whatever level coffee is at the moment. And I can understand then that your friend is, who is non-religious, is completely confused because we're using the same words that the religious people use. And I would go so far as to say, yes, let's give the Christians the word meditation and stop using it. And let's give the medical doctors who use the word mindfulness— we'll give them that word and stop using it. And then between you and me, there's another word, and that is Buddhism. And we can give that word to those people who want it and let them have it, right? That I am not a Buddhist. I've been a Bhikkhu for many, many years, but I'm not a Buddhist. I appreciate the Buddhists in Thailand, and there's a lot of them, but they don't practice what the Buddha taught.

**Speaker A:** The Hinayana, sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** That in fact, in Thailand, much of the Buddhism is in fact a religion, just like it is in the West.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, I've been in the sort of tourist monasteries in Thailand, in Bangkok, and well, in Bangkok, really, I can't remember being anywhere else. I mean, it's the— well, it's all— and I've been in them in Hong Kong too. It's all in one way or another sort of messy, and people are doing silly, superstitious things like buying gold leaf to put on the Buddha's statue and so on, which is not going to do anybody any good so far as I can see.

**Speaker B:** But the jewelers and the gold salesmen, they benefit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but what it did always impress me was that there was a kind of overall sense of peace. In any Buddhist monastery that I've been in.

**Speaker B:** That's true. That's one thing that we can say is that it's peaceful, it's easy, and that that's part of the teaching of the Buddha. Like I said, it's not everything in Christianity is wrong. Same thing about Buddhism, that not everything in Buddhism is wrong, but enough of it to where you and I would not call ourselves Buddhist. Because that would confuse people who don't know the distinctions. Yeah, just like your friend who is the religion or the non-religious guy is confused because everything that he's looking at over there fits that way. That in fact, you can think of it from the extremes in the sense that you've got a 12-inch ruler and that you've got something that's over at 12 inches and you're at 0 inches And anything that's at 6 inches from the 0 inches perspective looks like it's the same as the 12 inches. And in fact, all we can see is the two extremes to where the Buddha was very famous for teaching the middle path.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now the problem with the middle path is, is that we become targets for the two from both extremes. The joke is, is that in the Civil War, one guy decided that he is going to be neutral, so he put on gray pants and a blue shirt, and he was sitting on a fence, and he got shot at by both sides.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so that's what happens when we take this middle path, that non-religious people will see that which is actually in the middle as a religion.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, oh yes.

**Speaker B:** And those who were in the religion will take a look at the other day and they say, you're not religious at all. Well, no, I'm not religious at all, but I'm not at the extreme of being anti-religion. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** My secular friend did have a point, which was, they said, I thought you were supposed to sit on your own on a mountaintop and not join, not, not, not, you know, this is about sort of joining some sort of or going to some sort of group meeting. And I said, well, you got a point there because the Buddha did say go and sit in an empty hut or with your back against a tree, you know, or on a pile of leaves in the forest.

**Speaker B:** But not on the mountaintop. In fact, the mountaintop is a metaphor for your own mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker B:** To climb to the top, be at the top peak. Of your own humanity. So, I can appreciate what he is saying, but the seclusion that we so strongly recommend is not one's whole life. That in fact, in some places in Burma, there are monks who take it to extremes. There's a couple of them that have been famous for— they live in the meditation hall, and the only time that they leave the meditation hall— I call it a meditation hall, actually it's a board— but if they leave and they stay there all the time except to relieve themselves and to eat, and even they sit sleeping, sleep sitting up. Okay, that's not a life. That's not a life I want to live.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** I want a laptop and a cell phone, but I also like seclusion. And so there's a middle path in there that we can take, and that that middle path then is neither the atheist nothingness or whatever that your friend is. In fact, he's probably quite uneducated about religion, and some people are well too much educated about religion. And that you can teach him, in fact all of the people who ask you these questions, you can talk to them about the middle path, the place that's not an extreme, that just because you're not in the position of being completely atheist the way that he is, doesn't mean that you're way over there in the religious group either, that you're in the middle, and that the middle has to do with being in the present moment.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, this person did say that they'd had an experience of trying to sort of sit and empty the mind, and they found it scared them. They found themselves— thought they were disappearing, sort of thing.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Well, that does happen. Dissociation. And in fact, I wouldn't suggest— you've never heard me suggest to anyone to completely empty the mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, no, no.

**Speaker B:** And for many, that would be terrifying. That the way that I would say it is, is that when you see that you're having an unwholesome thought, change that unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought, whatever it might be. In fact, earlier today we talked about boredom, which is basically either restlessness all dressed up and no place to go, or boredom, which is I don't have anything to do right now with my mind. So they're very closely related. And the answer to that would be take great joy in the fact that you don't have anything to do right now. Wow. That's a moment of in-between.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, we don't have to take that extreme of, oh, isn't it bad that I don't have anything to do? And the extreme of I've got too much to do. Let's take the middle path of everything is easy. And so when he is practicing trying to empty his mind, first off, he's going to be not very good at it. He's going to fail. And second, it can be terrifying in the sense that he is not ready for emptiness. Yeah, we're in fact within Buddhism, emptiness, which means I don't have anything to do.

**Speaker A:** Mm.

**Speaker B:** Well, my calendar is empty. Isn't that marvelous? But he is still attached to the idea of self in the sense of he's disappearing, not that all of the crap is disappearing. It is he that's disappearing. And that's terrifying to a lot of people until they recognize that, hey, what you're losing is worth losing. Your selfishness.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, of course, this is where you get all this stuff about Dukkha, Anicca, and falling into the pit of the void and dark nights of the soul, all this sort of thing, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Actually, the dark night of the soul is not exactly what you would call of the void. That in fact, what's there in the dark night of the soul is fear, misery, disgust, despair, not getting what you want. That in fact, several places within Christianity where that's become quite clear and obvious. One of the most good, best examples was Mother Teresa.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, when she started getting a lot of money, she became a criminal with it. She didn't actually help the people in Calcutta. She built monasteries to have little girls to become her acolytes. But she had a dark night of the soul that lasted for years, and it wasn't even known until after her memoirs were published. And basically her complaint was, I've been talking to Jesus all these years and he won't talk back to me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that is— that's right. I read about that one. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so here's the point about the dark night of the soul, is she wants Jesus so bad and she can't have him, and she's become become fearful and just misery and disgusted and despair about that. And the Buddhists will do that too when they're paying only attention to the Dukkha. This is what we do mean by mindfulness and Vipassana practices. Look at the Dukkha, see the Dukkha, get more Dukkha, see that this Dukkha is related to that Dukkha. Look, let's go down this Dukkha rat hole. And pretty soon they wind up in their own city dump. And that the way out of that is that as soon as you see the Dukkha, which is the unwholesome thought, you get rid of it, right then and there. So if I'm angry, I can say, "Wait a minute, this guy doesn't control me, but I've gotten angry at him because I let him get to me.".

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Now, here is the thing. Relating to anger. I have found myself sitting, trying to— well, okay. I sit down, I do the breathing, I follow the Anapanasati practice. I know that I am carrying an anger and a resentment about some particular incident, recent incident involved, you know, that somebody, some, something, some, something, someone has said something and it has annoyed the shit out of me. And I am feeling the, the good feeling of the, you know, the, the good feeling coming on, the sort of trigger point, trigger sense, the the feeling of Piti coming. And I think at the same time, there is this anger, and I know that there is a hindrance there. And I know that, you know, I'm thinking sort of with what I'm trying to overcome the one with the other. And it's not working. It's the anger is still there. It's like you have to chip away at it.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Well, one of the best chisels to use is that he didn't hurt me bad enough to make me angry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And when I'm angry at him, I recognize, oh, I'm adding something to this, that what he was doing was not worth getting angry at.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know. But we're talking about feelings here, you know?

**Speaker B:** You've heard about revenge, in fact, that anger and revenge are very closely related. Of course. And one of the clichés that is used is that the best revenge is living well.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's true.

**Speaker B:** In other words, he didn't hurt me bad enough for me to lose my ability to live well. All right. And so my living well is the best revenge. So whenever we get angry at someone, we can say, he didn't hurt me that bad. Yeah, well, if he's criticizing me, then I can say later when I'm angry at him, oh, well, he didn't criticize me as much as I could. He missed out this. He didn't get that one. Yeah, well, that's— and then that that brings on the joy that at least he missed a few points. Yeah, that he wasn't really successful. He didn't destroy me, he only nicked me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so why should I criticize myself? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, what I— yes, I did find that it's, it's lovely actually. I, I flew You know, I flew a short flight yesterday to see my dying relative, and I felt as I sat down in the airplane seat, and I just sort of relaxed. I didn't even start breathing, start taking long breaths or whatever. And the feeling came on, like the feeling started without having the breath to trigger it. It's like the sort of triggering of the setting, either of the sort of Piti sense of something good flowing into the head from somewhere, or however you wanted to it. Describe it, that happened without the breathing. And I could feel it, and I could feel it, you know, as you sort of— this business about in the— the ones, the sort of that Brazington uses to teach it about— it suffuses you. It's like the sort of the all these metaphors of the guy making the soap and so on. So, there's this sense of getting suffused with it. But that came on, that sort of came on, and that seemed to propel the breathing rather than the breathing propelling it, which is Strange.

**Speaker B:** It feels good when you breathe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Allow it to, I mean, it's marvelous. Can you imagine that you don't like breathing? Well, then stop doing it for a while.

**Speaker A:** You can try that. You can try that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then you'll like the next breath when you breathe.

**Speaker A:** And then in fact, if you let the breathing become so slow and gentle that, you know, it gets to the stage, I suppose, where you breathe out and you feel yourself, there's still some more in there. So you pull the belly up and out it goes. And then you sort of, you can sort of pause at that stage and think, well, nothing in there. And you think, well, I better have some more and take it in again. So there is a— can be an element of the breath sort of stopping more or less in between breaths for a while.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's the point about letting the breath get very subtle as the way that you described it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is that as often associated with the higher jhanas.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Now, of the higher jhanas, besides them being described many times in the suttas, the Buddha said one thing is, is that it's a pleasant abiding.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** While someone is in the jhanas, it's pleasant.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And that's back to those guys in Burma who sit there for all of those hours, is because if they did get up out of the meditation hall and and left to go do something with their lives, then they would be back in the Dukkha again.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes.

**Speaker B:** And that the Buddha then, you know, in the Dhamma Chakra Bhavana Sutta— I mentioned this more often, that's the very first sermon that he gave according to the traditions— and that in this Dhamma Chakra Bhavana Sutta, the very first thing he teaches is the middle path, that the middle path and the Eightfold Noble Path are basically the same thing, that at the extremes you're going to find Dukkha, too hot or too cold. And that we're looking for the sweet spot in the middle. And yet people who are out doing the Jhanas, they're going to an extreme. So one extreme would be pain to the point of self-flagellation, which we do with our hindrances mentally, even though we're not sticking ourselves with a knife or whipping ourselves with a chain like some people do. We're still punishing ourselves for not doing our meditation practice correctly and other things like this. But someplace in the middle is where that sweet spot is, and the Buddha recommends that that's the first Jhana because we're free from the hindrances of self-flagellation, but we're also satisfied with that enough that we're not looking for more and more and more and more. Just being in that first Jhana is in fact the middle path, that's the path to enlightenment according to the Sutta No. 36 in the Majjhima.

**Speaker A:** Now, what was the number of the Dhamma Chakra Upadana?

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's somewhere in the Samyutta Nikaya. You could probably Google Buddha's first sermon and it'll come up.

**Speaker A:** Okay, fine. Well, yes, now here, that put me in mind of something which now has slipped out again. Oh yes, never mind, never mind, it'll come, I suppose.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go back to the point then that that guy, the atheist, doesn't understand the middle. He either sees everything as black or white, up or down, back and forth rather than letting things be in the middle. Which, by the way, that if you've done any, let us say, geometry with a graph, the middle point for the both up and down and back and forth is zero. There's nothing there. And so this is a place that we can come to that middle place where there's no problems, there's nothing to do, no place to go, and that that's the part that he's missing out on. And so maybe you can help him understand that really the correct practice is to not be religious and to not be anti-religion, but to be present, be in the moment.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is now— hang on. I mean, this is what I need to do, not be anti-religious, because I've been playing at anti-religion for 40 years or 50 or something, you know, doing anti-religion.

**Speaker B:** I know you won't let go of the fact that they injured you. You still have resentment and revenge to get.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** I tell you what, why don't the two of us get a bomb and go to the Vatican? At least we could blow up the guards and the gate.

**Speaker A:** You don't want to say things like that on the internet.

**Speaker B:** I know, I know. That's why I'm saying it in the sense of humor.

**Speaker A:** I know. Have you ever heard of a policeman with a sense of humor?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, every one of them have a sense of humor. They just don't want to show it to you. Yeah, but they will.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** They'Re trained out of having a sense of humor, and that training doesn't always work. Not always. I know, but I understand what you're saying. Yeah, that is dangerous to talk about getting our revenge. We're not supposed to get revenge, but we still hold that quality. We still hold that old anger. And what I'm asking you to do is to start playing with it. Turn it into a toy. Recognize that you're not going to get any revenge. Well, and so why carry it? Live well instead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Also, you can recognize that whatever the Catholic Church did for all of those centuries, hurting all of those people with all of those power plays and all of those divine rights that Anagami, the Kings, and all of that kind of stuff, you've got a pretty good life. Oh yeah, yeah. So they didn't do that much damage, even though they tried to damage you over and over again when you were a child. It didn't stick. You got out. So don't blame them for your seeking revenge and your resentment. Recognize that that's something that you're doing that's unnecessary, causing yourself your own suffering, because you're not going to get revenge from the Catholic Church. As I mentioned, in fact, earlier before we started the call, if you were going to call the Catholic Church to complain about the fact that they had damaged you, who are you going to talk to on the phone other than someone who is continuously getting damaged by the Catholic Church?

**Speaker A:** You won't even get that. You won't even get far. It'll be like any other large organization. You'll get a robot answering. You know, you get one of these talking robot things which will refuse to let you speak to a human.

**Speaker B:** I would believe that the Catholic Church will just keep the robot going. But most banks and other places they— the robot will get tired of not being able to give you what you want, and then they'll eventually give you to a human being.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that is true, that is true. I mean, eventually, if you hold on long enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, don't get your revenge up and you're feeling damaged by the robot too.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so that's, that's what he's there for. So you really will get damaged and you'll go away. It's to stop you.

**Speaker B:** You know. So in the big corporations, that's the only number that you have. But with your Catholics, I mean, you've got Catholic priests, you've got building managers. It's actually, I would think, for the Catholic Church would be easier to get a telephone number of someone that does not get guarded by a robocaller. Yeah, you could call your local pastor and tell him how much that you got damaged by the church. He may in fact start talking about he's more damaged than you are.

**Speaker A:** It's entirely possible.

**Speaker B:** He left and he's still caught in it.

**Speaker A:** That's entirely possible. Yeah, well, okay.

**Speaker B:** One more point about that, and that is that on the internet I have found out that there is a website and an organization behind it that is dedicated to serving preachers.

**Speaker A:** I know that one. Yes, I've seen that.

**Speaker B:** Who have tried to leave the church but can't, because if they leave the church, they'll lose their job, they'll lose their livelihood, they'll lose their family, they'll lose their housing. They'll lose everything if they quit the church. And so they keep going along to get along and they wind up in great Dukkha. Mm-hmm. I mean, there are a number of one-liners that a preacher could say from the pulpit and he'd be out of a job probably that day.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh, yes, that is interesting.

**Speaker B:** It's particularly— Like, God is everywhere, I've got him in my pocket. That gets you in trouble.

**Speaker A:** Of course. Of course. Oh, yes, you've got to follow the script.

**Speaker B:** And so, these guys have to follow that script, even though they don't believe in it anymore. So, go call one of those priests, get him to confess to you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the other thing, I do. I do feel again this sort of, I do feel a reluctance to join in things though. I do feel a reluctance to actually go to any kind of Buddhist group and I feel a reluctance to— I can understand that. To sign up the OSF, you know, sign up, you've got all this stuff about sign up.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, here's the point about that. You're seeing it as an organization.

**Speaker A:** I am indeed.

**Speaker B:** And I'm seeing it as a group of friends, my friends. And you could use some friends, and oftentimes the friends will be found among friends. But if you think of it as an organization, especially if it's got even the twinge or the hint of religion, then you're going to be against it. But if you can recognize that there's a lot of interesting things and maybe some interesting people in there.

**Speaker A:** Rather than.

**Speaker B:** Seeing it as an organization— because believe me, uh, Open Sangha Foundation is not organized.

**Speaker A:** Well, these— this is true. Well, no, I don't say I don't know that this is true. I just know that you know, the podcast stopped, which is why I spoke to you and why you put me onto the other guy, that Carl, is it the Irishman? Who was it?

**Speaker B:** You mean the podbean? Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Did you see that get started back up again?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I did the subscription for it.

**Speaker B:** I know. I bunged it up. And that's back running again as far as I know.

**Speaker A:** But that was just for my benefit because I like to listen to podcasts where I don't like to listen to YouTube because I can't put the YouTube in my pocket. It switches off. You know, I can't turn the screen off and the podcast, the YouTube switches off. I can't do anything else while I'm listening to you watching a YouTube. Whereas if I get it as a podcast, I can go for a walk or something while listening to it.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. Okay. So as far as I know that Pedro who is doing that, is putting up at least one a day.

**Speaker A:** Yes, he is. It's all started again. It's good. But this is entirely for my benefit, really.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad you're getting benefit. May others also get benefit.

**Speaker A:** Well, I hope they do, yes.

**Speaker B:** In fact, Pedro is getting benefit by just doing that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, he's very— he seems he's never off the posting things on the, on the, the, uh, UK.

**Speaker B:** Are you talking about the Skype? Uh-huh, the Skype groups. Yes, he's got quite a, quite a good number of people who are good friends are on the Skype.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's a lot of people sort of putting a lot of cut and paste stuff on there too, things that they find interest them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's one of the things we're going to do with the website too. Doing a lot of cutting and pasting to give some variety and give some new stuff on a regular basis.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, oh, maybe, maybe I should— maybe now there was something I found which interested me. I may have mentioned it before, somebody's view on nimittas. And I did raise that question. Somebody wrote an essay at Ajahn, some— I can't remember, Suomo or so, anyway, some guy somewhere in some monastery in America wrote an essay on it, which interested me. And you know how the idea of the nimitta as something visual came in, in the Visuddhimarga or someplace like that.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And it isn't in there as an original.

**Speaker B:** There's a lot of confusion about nimittas. At least let me say this much about it, and that is that the original nimitta was to be able to take an object and look at it and close your eyes and remember it in great detail. Yeah, the same thing is true about the chanting. It's actually a way of remembering, and in fact, using this is a way of developing photographic memory. So, um, uh, the example that I sometimes use is Oliver Twist, you know, the novel by Charles Dickens, where when he went to London He fell into a group of thieves, and the master thief would train them by having Oliver Twist and the other students walk past the storefront, just walk past the place, and then they have to remember every item in the window. OK, that's, that's the nematode, to be able to see things and then remember it. One of the things that I would do, for instance, let us say, because I remember this exactly. To see a very quick screenshot of a whole bunch of jets in formation. And then after it passed by, I would count how many there were. I would remember the arrangement and whatnot and be able to count how many jets there were in that thing, even though I hadn't seen it. Then I would slide back or go backwards and remember and say, yeah, I got that one right. There was in fact 9 jets. Okay, so this is a way that we can train. This is what the nimitta is really all about. Now, in application, after you're breathing in long and breathing out long, that you can still feel the sensation of the breath on the area of the tip of the nose even after the out-breath is finished. When you're paying attention to it, when you breathe out It'll give you some sensation. Where is the sensation? The most prominent sensation would be around the nostrils someplace where you can feel the air as it's going out. Can you still feel that air after you stop breathing out? That would be the nematode.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can, and it sort of interferes with with the breath coming in on the next breath because you're still remembering.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's something new. Okay, but that's something new to come back into the newness of it and to be able to really establish ourselves in the new. And then it gets old and something else gets new. So let's reestablish into the new new and let the old new go. Okay, so that would be the nimitta of the moment. Whatever you're looking at when you close your eyes, you can still see it after you close your eyes. Once you've heard something, you can stop listening to outside stuff and repeat what you just heard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that's what a nimitta is, is that's that kind of memory that we want to develop in order for us to be able to do those long chants. Yes, so memory and nimittas are very closely related to one another, but it has to do with the experience of the here-now. So after you breathe out and having the sensations of the breathing out, when you stop, you can still feel those sensations. No, momentarily, but then when you start breathing in again, you've got a whole new set of sensations to pay close attention to. Another example of that is the guy opens the door to his apartment to rush in to go to the bathroom, and when he comes out of the bathroom, he can't find his keys. Well, he just used the key to open the door only 5 minutes ago. He had that key, but he wasn't thinking about it when he set it down. Either threw it on the couch absentmindedly or put it on a dresser absentmindedly or something. He's not paying attention. But the way that we can remember where those keys are is because we've got the nimitta. We've got the memory of where we put that thing. This is one of the advantages of becoming organized. And in fact, this is the training to become organized, is that he keeps putting the keys in the same place. When he comes in, no matter how much of an emergency he's in.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, in my case, in my case, my keys must go into my left-hand trouser pocket. It's that simple. And if they're not in my left-hand.

**Speaker B:** Trouser pocket— now you have to later figure out which trouser the pocket's in.

**Speaker A:** There comes an immediate sort of sense of panic. Oh God, I lost my key.

**Speaker B:** And that is a sense of panic that only takes an instant of mindfulness, or an instant of to remember.

**Speaker A:** Or.

**Speaker B:** The Sati of wake up when you're setting your keys down. This is the training that we're going through because we're actually avoiding the hell, the Christian hell by the way, of how we feel when we can't find our keys. And so we don't go to hell because we remember where we put our keys. And we remember because we were paying attention when we set them down. This is the nimitta.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, easy enough. So don't go to hell by forgetting about where you put your keys. But better still, don't go to the hell of hating the Catholic Church. Don't go to the hell of feeling like they damaged you. Yes, well, they taught you some good stuff, of course. And in fact, most of the bad stuff that they did teach you, you're over now. You can live well without the Catholic Church. You don't have to resent them.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** I'm the same way with the Baptists, except now the way that I look like the Baptists is every time that I think of them, I start howling with laughter. What a ridiculous group of people that is.

**Speaker A:** But I always, I think of the father of my relative who's now sort of looking at the Grim Reaper sort of thing. Who recanted his— I mean, he did the whole Catholic thing for sort of— and then he pulled out somewhere along the line and he was always regarded himself as a humanist, and I think, and then and at the last minute he called for the priest.

**Speaker B:** And you know, that's what they're hoping for. Last rites.

**Speaker A:** No, what I'm afraid of is that I'll run out of— I'll not have the balls not to call for the priest.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but this is the whole teaching of the Buddha then, in fact, regardless of which group or form of them goes to, they have this thing about what's going to be your last thought. Yeah, what's going to be your last thing that you do? And the answer to that would be, haha, it's finally over. I can really take a rest now. I'm dead. Okay, so can we practice planning for that? Can we practice by being happy about our thoughts of death? Old people, they want to live longer and longer. I'll be very happy when I'm dead, or dying at least. I know that it's over. As Robert Frost the poet said, I've got long to go before I sleep.

**Speaker A:** Miles to go, wasn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Got miles to go before I sleep. Okay, so I've got a daughter who's only 10 years old. I got to stay alive until she's adult.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** But that's about the last thing. All I have to do is just sit around being happy and alive for the next 10 years. Nothing to it. And then I'll be very happy to die.

**Speaker A:** Well, good luck with that. I find it difficult to understand anybody feeling happy to die, but Well, it's going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Your choice: are you going to let it happen and be happy about it, or are you going to let it happen and be miserable, and then be miserable for the next 10 or 20 years before it happens? Because you know you'll be miserable when it does happen. The training about being in the present moment is the thoughts we have about death. Can you train to have thoughts about death, happily thoughts? I know, because you've always had unhappy thoughts about death. Let's have some happy thoughts about death. I mean, that chicken that we had for supper, I'm really happy that dead— that chicken was dead. I wouldn't want to have to eat it while it was still alive. That's what snakes do.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what the chicken thought when it was being— when it was having its neck wrung though. Probably wasn't enjoying that too much.

**Speaker B:** Well, it depends upon if it was an enlightened chicken. The enlightened chicken says, "Thank you, man. I'm really glad to go." Yeah, death happens. Are we going to be there for it and happy, or are we going to be miserable when we die? Because if we know we're going to be miserable, then we're going to be miserable long before we're dead, just thinking about death. So let's start having some wholesome, happy thoughts about dying.

**Speaker A:** I have to say that if anybody watches this as a YouTube, if you put it up, at least they'll get a laugh out of the thought of us trying to get into the mind of the dying chicken.

**Speaker B:** I know. A happy dying chicken. And he was even more delicious because he was happy to give his life for my dinner plate.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, even the enlightened chicken.

**Speaker B:** An enlightened chicken, right? They're happy to go out.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure that's right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, okay. Let's happily end this call. It's going to be dead meat in 3, 4 minutes or less.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cheers then. Thank you for all of that, and we will speak again in a while. Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, go teach your religious friend about the middle path.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Cheers. Try well. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** We'll see you later. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), is a wide-ranging, practical discussion that centers on moving beyond religious baggage to find the core of the Buddha's teachings. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Themes & Summary**

1.  **Beyond "Religion": The Middle Path**
    The conversation starts with Speaker A's aversion to joining a Buddhist group because its chanting felt "religious," triggering negative memories of his Catholic upbringing. Dhammarato reframes this not as a jump from one religion to another, but as a move to the **Middle Path**. He argues that the practice is not about adopting a new belief system, but about **mental development** (*bhavana*). The goal is to find a point that is neither dogmatically religious nor reactively anti-religious, but focused on present-moment awareness.

2.  **The Practical Value of Rituals (Like Chanting)**
    Dhammarato defends practices like chanting not as religious obligations, but as **tools for mental training**. He explains their benefits:
    *   **Developing Memory & Concentration:** Chanting trains the mind to focus and remember, building a "photographic memory."
    *   **Internalizing the Teachings:** If you understand what you're chanting (e.g., the Buddha's words in Pali), it reinforces the Dhamma. He contrasts this with Christian chanting of Latin Psalms, which may be meaningless if not understood.
    *   The key is **intention**—using the practice as a skillful means, not empty ritual.

3.  **The Essence of Practice: "Wakey Wakey" in the Present Moment**
    The heart of the talk is the emphasis on **present-moment awareness**. Dhammarato critiques terms like "meditation" and "mindfulness" as often misunderstood. He prefers calling it **"mental development"** or, more vividly, **"wakey wakey"** (a translation of *sati*).
    *   The practice is about **training to be here now**, letting go of unwholesome past memories (like resentment) and future anxieties.
    *   The breath (*anapanasati*) is the primary anchor for this—not as a long, technical exercise, but as a way to joyfully connect with **"this long deep breath."**

4.  **Working with Hindrances: Anger and Resentment**
    Speaker A shares a practical struggle: feeling anger arise even as pleasant *piti* (joyful energy) begins during sitting. Dhammarato offers pragmatic advice:
    *   **Reframe the Narrative:** Use thoughts like, "He didn't hurt me bad enough to make me lose my ability to live well."
    *   **The Best Revenge is Living Well:** Don't let others control your inner peace. By cultivating joy, you disarm the harm they intended.
    *   He applies this directly to Speaker A's long-held resentment toward the Catholic Church, urging him to see that carrying that anger is now a self-created burden, and that "living well" is the true freedom.

5.  **Jhanas and the "Pleasant Abiding"**
    Speaker A describes experiences where joyful feelings arise spontaneously, even propelling the breath. Dhammarato connects this to the **jhanas**, describing them as a **"pleasant abiding"** (*sukha-vihara*).
    *   He cautions against seeking the jhanas as an extreme escape from life. The **First Jhana** itself—free from the five hindrances—is presented as the ideal **Middle Path**, a sustainable state of balanced well-being.

6.  **Clarifying Concepts: Nimitta and Death**
    *   **Nimitta:** Dhammarato demystifies this often-misunderstood term. He defines it simply as the **after-image or memory of a sensation** (e.g., feeling the breath at the nostrils even after the exhale is complete). It's about sharpening perceptual clarity and memory in the present moment, not chasing visual lights.
    *   **Death:** The discussion ends with training for a wholesome view of death. Instead of fearing it, Dhammarato suggests practicing **having happy thoughts about the inevitable end**. The point is to avoid spending your life in misery about an unavoidable event and to meet it with a peaceful, even accepting, mind.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **The path is a training in mental development,** not a religion. Its value is in its practical results.
*   **The core skill is learning to "wake up" to the present moment** repeatedly, using the breath as an anchor.
*   **Let go of ideological battles (religious vs. secular).** Focus on what is wholesome and works for your mental well-being here and now.
*   **Work with hindrances like anger through wise reflection and re-framing,** not just suppression.
*   **The goal is a balanced, peaceful abiding in the middle**—free from extremes of self-punishment and sensual greed, found in the joyful, mindful present.

The talk is characterized by its informal, conversational tone, use of humor, and direct application of Buddhist principles to everyday psychological struggles.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The 12-inch Ruler:** Used to explain how people at extremes (e.g., staunch atheism and organized religion) view the middle path. From the "0 inch" perspective of atheism, anything at "6 inches" (the middle path) looks identical to the religious extreme at "12 inches." This illustrates why the speaker's non-religious friend misidentifies his Buddhist-inspired practice as just another religion.

2.  **The Mountaintop:** The "mountaintop" of seclusion is reinterpreted not as a physical place, but as a **metaphor for one's own mind**—reaching the peak of one's own humanity and awareness through mental development.

3.  **The Middle Path as a Target:** The middle path is described as making one a target from both extremes. This is illustrated with the **story/joke of the man in the Civil War** who wore a mix of blue and gray to be neutral and was shot at by both sides.

4.  **Chiseling Away at Anger:** Anger and hindrances are compared to something that must be **chipped away at with a chisel**. The suggested "chisel" is the reframing thought: "He didn't hurt me bad enough to make me angry."

5.  **Living Well as Revenge:** The common cliché is invoked as a tool for mental training: **"The best revenge is living well."** This is presented as an antidote to resentment, framing personal well-being as a victorious outcome.

6.  **The Dukkha Rat Hole:** Some meditation practices that focus excessively on suffering (*dukkha*) are metaphorically described as leading practitioners down a **"dukkha rat hole"** into their own internal "city dump."

7.  **The Nimitta as a Memory Tool:** The concept of *nimitta* (often associated with a visual sign in meditation) is explained through the **metaphor of developing a photographic memory**, like a thief in training recalling items in a shop window (a reference to *Oliver Twist*).

8.  **Hell as Daily Frustration:** Forgetting where you put your keys and the ensuing panic is described as a **small, self-created "hell."** Mindfulness is the training to avoid this hell by paying attention in the present moment.

9.  **The Enlightened Chicken:** Used humorously to make a point about accepting death. An **"enlightened chicken"** would be happy to give its life for a meal, serving as a whimsical model for cultivating happy, accepting thoughts about one's own mortality.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Parable of the Workers:** Speaker A references the **Biblical parable of the vineyard workers** (Matthew 20:1-16), where those who worked all day are paid the same as those who started late. Speaker B reinterprets this not as a literal economic lesson but as a **metaphor for life itself**—we all receive the "wages" of being alive, regardless of how long our individual "day" (life) lasts, and jealousy over others' circumstances is pointless.

2.  **The Monk Who Chanted the Tripitaka:** Speaker B tells the story of a Thai monk (the mentor of his teacher) who, at the Sixth Buddhist Council in the 1950s, **chanted the entire Tripitaka (Buddhist scriptures) from memory** over three months. This story illustrates the incredible potential of memory developed through chanting and serves to justify its practice as mental training.

3.  **Mother Teresa's "Dark Night of the Soul":** The story of **Mother Teresa's prolonged spiritual crisis**, where she felt Jesus was not answering her, is used as an example of the suffering that comes from intense craving and attachment (in her case, for divine communion). It's paralleled with meditators who become stuck in observing suffering.

4.  **The Preachers' Website:** Speaker B references an online organization for **preachers who want to leave the church but feel trapped**, fearing the loss of livelihood, family, and community. This story humanizes religious figures and illustrates the institutional suffering within religious systems.

5.  **Personal Anecdote - Remembering Poems:** Speaker B spontaneously recites parts of **"The Raven" and "A Visit from St. Nicholas" ("The Night Before Christmas")** to demonstrate how the joyful, present-moment engagement of recitation is a form of wholesome mental activity and memory training.

In summary, the dialogue uses metaphors of measurement, targeting, and tools (ruler, chisel) to explain philosophical positions. It draws stories from Buddhist lore, Christian scripture, historical anecdote, and personal experience to challenge rigid definitions, defend practices like chanting, illustrate the pitfalls of extremes, and promote a flexible, present-moment-focused "middle path."
