### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Try to have power.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, people want power, and the reason that the people want power is because they're afraid, and so they want power so that they won't be afraid. To defend them, this is exactly why people get angry, is because they want the power of anger to cover up their fear. And when people are afraid, they feel vulnerable.

**Speaker A:** Oh.

**Speaker B:** They feel like a victim, and so they want power. Many people want power over other people.

**Speaker A:** Well, if somebody is busy trying to control someone else, then how are they going to be able to control themselves?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's a good question. What's the answer?

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, I observe when I'm interacting with dogs that if I am focusing on a dog, trying to control a dog, Well, then I am— I'm not at the helm controlling myself. Um, it's, it's like, uh, wanting to.

**Speaker B:** Control the dog means that in fact you're out of control yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's— and dog trainers have developed a huge number of techniques to get the dog to see Dogs actually don't learn very well, but if you hear a dog howling and you start howling with them and then congratulate them every time they howl, then you can get them to sing. Like, for instance, playing guitar, and the dog will howl because of conditioning. But the dog did the howling in the first place. You can't ask a dog to howl and expect him to howl. Only a howling dog can be trained with that howling because he's already doing the howling.

**Speaker A:** Oh, um, I've, uh, I found if I make certain sounds, uh, dogs may want to howl. It depends, but they tend to howl at sirens, at emergency vehicle sirens.

**Speaker B:** That's one of them. You know why? Because the siren to the dog sounds like another dog howling.

**Speaker A:** Oh. Oh, okay. So they're singing in sync with the other Anicca.

**Speaker B:** That's what I just noticed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's cool. Is there a distinction between the brain and the mind?

**Speaker B:** Well, let us say it this way: the brain is physical, is a physiological chemical complex, and chemical reactions happen inside the brain, and the result of those chemical reactions in the brain is the mind.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so is it kind of like software in a computer?

**Speaker B:** Not exactly. Oh, but that's close enough an analogy that it can be used. Hmm. Because an example of that, an example of that is that a computer is a serial processor. It does one thing at a time, one thing at a time. General purpose. There is such a thing as an array processor, which actually is just a huge number of little processors who can all process simultaneously. This is what you would refer to as a graphics card, a graphics chip, and now an NVIDIA, but they're parallel processors. But each little processor does one step at a time: a store, a fetch, an add. Now, the human brain Works in a similar way. It does one chemical process reaction, one after another. Even the Buddha knew that and talked about it in the sense of one by one as they occur.

**Speaker A:** Sounds a lot like code in a computer.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because in that regard, you can say there's a different— another analogy. And that another analogy is, is that the software can be upgraded. You can change. So the software is not the hardware. You are not your brain. You are not your mind. You are not the body, just like the processor in a PC is not Windows.

**Speaker A:** So it's— so would it be possible for someone to completely heal from trauma?

**Speaker B:** That's a way of speaking. That's a way of speaking. Let us put it also this way, that trauma is actually the way that we respond to things instinctively. For instance, you see danger and instinctively you react to it in a very strong way. And that through proper training, we can overcome that. Just like instinctively, a monkey cannot play a guitar. Instinctively, a human child cannot play the guitar, but they can be trained to play the guitar. They can train themselves to play the guitar. So in that regard, you can train yourself out of your post-traumatic stress disorder. So then it just seems practice. Over and over again. Practice, practice. Why? Because the post-traumatic stress disorder is not something that just is, it's something that someone practices. Oh, we practice freaking out until we get really good at freaking out over any and every little thing. So you can practice not freaking out.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so then when someone has trauma or post-trauma, they're just refueling it, right? Just keeping it going.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. They're practicing it over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** So I had a theory about something similar that it's a conditioning. So—.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is a conditioning rather than a condition.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so then it can be undone. Yeah. So people with bad habits, they're just perpetuating those bad habits over and over again. Wow. I mean, then they're participating in their own misery, or if someone's miserable, creating.

**Speaker B:** Their own misery each and every time they practice it. And then they get very good because of the practice. They're very skilled at being miserable.

**Speaker A:** Wow. It's just a form of bad training.

**Speaker B:** Precisely.

**Speaker A:** I mean, that totally redefines, for instance, what trauma is.

**Speaker B:** In a way, because like I said, it's not a condition, it's a conditioning. And that's all we have to do to redefine it.

**Speaker A:** So PTSD is not something that happened to somebody It's something that someone does.

**Speaker B:** Well, of course, exactly. Look at the way that it's phrased. PTSD— post means after. Post-traumatic. So they had a traumatic incident, and after that traumatic incident, they give themselves stress over and over again until it becomes a disorder. How did they do that? Is because they subconsciously remember that trauma and restress themselves over and over and over again. It's conditioning. And you can practice to stop that.

**Speaker A:** Oh, wow. So, so, yeah, it's Wow, it's not, um, it doesn't have to be permanent.

**Speaker B:** That's why the Buddha tells you everything is temporary. Nothing is permanent. The software is not the hardware. You are not who you thought you were. Your personality is not fixed.

**Speaker A:** Wow. So when people label themselves as victims, they're just creating that life.

**Speaker B:** Again and again and again, they're recreating it. And when you start to have happy, wholesome thoughts, you're interrupting that pattern and creating something new, something that's closer to actual reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. That, um, that could make someone feel silly, uh, if they've been doing something that hurts.

**Speaker B:** Feeling silly is conditioning. Oh yeah, they have conditioned themselves to feel silly. That's actually, in a way, you can call that a post-traumatic stress disorder, is to feel silly when proven wrong. Instead of feeling silly, you can control that and change it. Instead of feeling silly, you can feel grateful for finding out what's real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's, uh, it's much healthier.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true. Much healthier. But we were trained to feel silly. We were trained to re-experience our traumas. We met a bully when we were 14, and now we see bullies everywhere.

**Speaker A:** That's common, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so the common condition is, is that people feel like victims. They go around in a mental state of being a victim because they continuously victimize themselves. They're victiming.

**Speaker A:** So they're playing a role or something, or they think they are.

**Speaker B:** They're reading the same script over and over and over again, and they don't even know it.

**Speaker A:** That's kind of like someone walking into a wall and they just keep walking into it over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. That's an analogy. Or you can still— you can say you keep stepping in a dog pile even though you know that there's dog piles in the yard. You're still not watching where you're going and you keep stepping on them.

**Speaker A:** But that, yeah, that's, that's, that's being silly.

**Speaker B:** No, you're calling it silly. I call it ordinary. That's the ordinary human condition.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's very common.

**Speaker B:** About 99% or better.

**Speaker A:** Of the whole world?

**Speaker B:** Of the whole world.

**Speaker A:** Wow. I mean, that's kind of like nearly everybody is walking around with blindfolds on.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. That's why the Buddha talks about look. They're not looking. They're seeing but they're not looking. They're blind. You probably heard the phrase, there are none so blind as those who refuse to see.

**Speaker A:** Oh sure, yes.

**Speaker B:** So they would go walking around with this blindfold on, and the blindfold itself is the old conditioning, the stuff that they've been practicing, to where an actual blind person can get around very well. Yes, because they're still taking in sensory input. But those who have eyes, they keep running into walls because they're not looking.

**Speaker A:** It's— it— I have this theory that at one time humanity was much healthier. I'm not sure if that actually exists.

**Speaker B:** If you go to the zoo, you'll see chimpanzees chasing each other around the same way that humans do. They're belligerent. They fight with each other over bananas, all kinds of things. And in fact, you could go so far as to say that humanity learns their worst traits from their ancestors.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, because we still have superstition.

**Speaker B:** Um, Monkeys have superstitions.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow, was that conditioned into them?

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, by their parents.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, the monkey society is not much different than human society, is it?

**Speaker B:** Not much. In fact, you start to really get funny. You can see a monkey playing with a cell phone. You can teach a monkey to play with a cell phone. In fact, the only way that you can teach a monkey to play with a cell phone is by letting the monkey see you play with the cell phone. Monkey see, monkey do. Oh, which is exactly the way that you would train a dog. You let the dog see what you want and they'll understand. So the way to train a puppy, for instance— you, uh, puppies are the only ones that can, they can, uh, be trained. And the reason for that is because they're playful. So if you see a puppy play with a ball, you can play with the ball with the puppy, and pretty soon you can teach that puppy to chase balls. And then he can chase frisbees and become a world champion for jumping high in the air to catch the frisbee. Why? Because the puppy would play with you with a little ball when he was just a few weeks old. But older dogs, they don't bother to play. They're too smart, they don't play. And so that's why you have the expression, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

**Speaker A:** They see through the illusion, or— No.

**Speaker B:** They don't see the illusion at all. They don't see what you want them to do because you're not doing what they want to do. Oh.

**Speaker A:** Um, I've never noticed that before. Um, I've had older dogs. I have an older dog, um, but I, I don't try to play. I just, I just pet her. To me, that's, that's enough.

**Speaker B:** I never had an older dog the same age. You could play with them because you've been playing with them since they were a puppy. Oh, and they continue to play because that's their habit. But if the human doesn't play with their puppy when it grows older, it doesn't play. But in fact, that's any dog trick. Whether the dog is riding a bicycle, wearing a funny costume, popping balloons, opening doors, whatever the dog is doing, it's doing it because it played doing that when it was a puppy. And that you can take that information and recognizing that almost everything that you do as an adult, you did it because you did it as a child. And so the skills that we have are the skills that we developed when we were children. And so it's kind of, uh, the same situation. It's hard to teach an adult human new tricks. And in that regard, that's why meditation is difficult, because it has to be practiced over and over and over again. So.

**Speaker A:** Someone who's 9 years old would learn meditation easier?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, then Yeah, if they're taught correctly, they'll practice correctly. If what you mean by meditation is you teach the child to sit on the floor and keep his mouth shut and stay still, he can still be in turmoil mentally. But if you teach the child correctly what meditation is, which is to have happy thoughts, then the child at age 9 can have happy thoughts. Easier.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a, what a nice life that would be, uh, for someone to—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but you got to start with where you are now. That's all we have is right now. Being an adult wanting to be trained correctly at the age of 9 is now just wanting something you can't have.

**Speaker A:** Oh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's— instead of saying it would have been nice if that had happened, you can say I can make it nice right now.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is what the practice is, is practicing over and over and over again to change those unwholesome, uh, stressful thoughts. Stop thinking about what everything is a trauma and see everything is delightful, everything is okay, everything is fine. We have to train ourselves that way because we have trained ourselves that everything is stressful. So we practice over and over and over again. No place to go, nothing to do. Wow, everything is really cool right now. Wow, isn't it nice? And we practice that over and over and over again. And I'm giving you the invitation right now to start to practice right now. Over and over and over again, starting right bloody now. It is, um, now you're going to ask a question again, and you've been invited to start practicing instead. Let's have some happy thoughts. Let me hear some happy thoughts rather than questions.

**Speaker A:** Is gratitude qualified as a happy thought?

**Speaker B:** Certainly. And you know that. Why do you have to ask? But in fact, whenever you're asking questions, that means that the mind is full of doubt. Can you see the doubt behind the questions and come out of that doubt and say, well, I don't have to be doubtful right now, I can just enjoy the moment?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I've actually recognized a whole lot of doubt recently.

**Speaker B:** And well, that's what this whole call has been— one doubt after another after another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So why can't we make the rest of the call joyful. One joyful, happy thought. One wholesome thought after another. One skillful thought after another. By practicing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, as of right now, I'm thankful to be warm. It's warm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're okay. You're not cold. Here it is, almost December, and you're okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's—.

**Speaker B:** Is there— I can see that doubt and those questions all over your face right now.

**Speaker A:** It's— yeah, there's some, there's some doubt there. I'm wondering, is it— well, see it.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point. That's the training that you need, is the training to recognize that your mind is in doubt and you have questions. And the reality is, is that getting those questions answered— look how many questions I've answered in the past 30 minutes and you're still in doubt. So getting questions answered doesn't eradicate the doubt. Seeing the doubt and throwing it out That's the way of eradicating the doubt.

**Speaker A:** What's the replacement?

**Speaker B:** There you go again.

**Speaker A:** Well, is there a good replacement for doubt?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Hey, I don't have to know anything. I can just sit here and be happy. I don't have to have my questions answered. All I need to do is have happy thoughts. So, well, can you start having some happy thoughts there?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, I mean, I'd like to say everything's going to be okay, but— Well, it is.

**Speaker B:** Everything is already okay. You've just been telling yourself that it's not okay for so long that it's hard for you to start telling yourself it's okay. Take the right effort to say everything is fine, because actually everything really is fine right this very minute. You're not in danger. The cops are not breaking in. You don't have alligators chewing on your leg. There's no cheetahs jumping on your back right now. Everything is okay. Can you see that and say it? Right now everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it is. It is fine.

**Speaker B:** It's the only thing that's gnawing at you is your own doubt.

**Speaker A:** That's the, that's the panther. That's right, it's the alligator, imaginary alligator.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, your own imaginary alligators. And people do that. They get— that's the post-traumatic stress disorder. The stress is gone. Excuse me, the trauma is gone, but they keep bringing it back in. Oh, uh, they recreate the stress over and over and over again until it becomes a disorder. But it was always post. What does post mean? It means that the trauma that we had in childhood, we keep repeating those, giving ourselves stress. It's a manufactured— manufactured bad feelings.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's no fun.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what you're doing when you're doubtful. Yeah, let's have some fun.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah, yeah, that's— yeah, it's, um, it's like, uh, you know, like 6-year-olds who are carefree and don't, don't worry about really anything.

**Speaker B:** Don't worry about anything. And here you are worried about every little thing, worried about magic, worried about your mama, worried about this, that, and the other thing. You're in the habit of worry. Can you see that you're in a habit of being doubtful and worried and restless and just say, wow, everything's okay?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it has real physical impacts, uh, maintaining that state.

**Speaker B:** Um, sure it does. When you keep carrying it around, picking it up and carrying it around, picking it up and carrying it around, it has physical influences. So why pick it up? And if you pick it up, why can't you see you picked it up and set it down immediately?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the doubt, that's been hard for me to focus on, for me to recognize. You've pointed it out a bunch of times, and I'm noticing, yeah, that's doubt. Um, this is kind of new, this observation of doubt for me.

**Speaker B:** I'm not— um, and so you have very little skill at it. Let's develop some skill. Let's see that doubt. Let's look at it. Let's look for it. Let's have some fun here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Just stop trying to find the fun by being doubtful. Where's that doubt? Oh, where's that fun? Oh, I can't find it. I don't see it anywhere. Oh, poor me.

**Speaker A:** Well, if the doubt is invisible, it can't be much of a problem then.

**Speaker B:** Well, you've made it a problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You stressed yourself right out about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, so the, the happy thoughts, they, they get rid of all that, right? Get rid of all the doubt and.

**Speaker B:** Get rid of it. All right, um, stop asking questions about it and just do it. Yeah, everything is okay, everything is fine, everything's okay, everything is all right, not a problem in the world, no place to go, nothing to do. Wow, isn't it nice right now? Wow, things are really playful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So say it, say it. Yes, start having some happy thoughts. Everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Wow, everything is all right, everything is nice right now. Let me hear it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right, it is. It's nice right now, it's, it's just fine.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay. No alligators, no crocodiles, no doubts, no worries, no frustrations. Wow, everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow, the doubt itself is like an alligator.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is. You just recognized that 5 minutes ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know. It's— it's— I'm having a hard time making it stick.

**Speaker B:** Um, Well, practice making it stick, Mr. Alligator. Get out of here. I'm having too much fun.

**Speaker A:** To become.

**Speaker B:** Doubtful about how to have fun.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, it was just a short time ago when I would have asked myself, uh, you know, what am I doing? Like, what is all this stuff?

**Speaker B:** There it is.

**Speaker A:** This, this is all this complication. It's all pretty new, actually.

**Speaker B:** It's— yeah, actually, we're uncomplicating things. Doubt and questioning makes things complicated, makes it stressful. All we have to do is say, I don't have to know the answer to those questions, I'm already okay. Oh yeah, you're already okay. And you disturb that by asking questions, being doubtful, oh, being worried, when in fact if you just drop that stuff, you can start to say, hey, everything is okay right now. Convince me everything is okay right now. Come on, convince me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it is okay. It's, um, it's warm to convince yourself.

**Speaker B:** Convince me everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah. Does laughter count as a happy thought?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— yeah.

**Speaker B:** Wow, everything really is all right. Everything is already okay. Not a worry in the world. And we can practice that over and over and over again, because otherwise, what are you going to practice?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh, doubtful and full of questions. You have to actually intentionally practice. Keep telling yourself, keep telling me, everything is fine, everything's okay. Come on, convince me.

**Speaker A:** Everything's fine, it's— we're having, we're having a good moment.

**Speaker B:** We're— yeah, we're having fun here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's, um, it reminds me of some time in the past when, uh.

**Speaker B:** I would— don't remind yourself times in the past. Let's just be happy right now. Don't go back into the past. Stay right here. Everything right now is okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything is fine. It's— there's no reason for it not to be fine.

**Speaker B:** I mean, other than the reasons you made up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like, uh, manufactured hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Let's start manufacturing some joy.

**Speaker A:** Some joy. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let's start manufacturing the feeling of safe. Everything is okay, not a worry in the world, nothing dangerous here at all. Wow, let's feel safe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is, it is safe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and if we're safe, that means that we're not victims to anything, that we're the champion. We've made it safe.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that feels like a big accomplishment.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is. You've been miserable your whole life, and here I am starting to interrupt that. It's time for you to interrupt it too. That's a big deal.

**Speaker A:** It's a polite interruption. It's a good interruption.

**Speaker B:** All right, imagine that there is a truck on the train tracks and the trucker can see the train coming. All he has to do is to drive his truck off the tracks. Now what he has interrupted is the train hitting his truck. The train hitting the truck's a big disaster. Let's also see that you're standing in the road of your own thoughts. They come barreling down on you and run you right over, and all you have to do is step out of the way.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow, yes. Oh, that's a, that's a good tangible way to recognize, yeah, they're like oncoming traffic. Uh, well, yeah, why would someone want.

**Speaker B:** To get in your own mind? And all you have to do is say, wow, I'm glad I don't have to think about that. Wow, I don't have to be confused and doubtful right now. I can just be happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, there's no room for doubt where there's happiness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and there's no happiness when full of doubt. Your choice.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, wow. Is that— somebody mentioned— be careful, huh?

**Speaker B:** Be careful, you're starting to ask questions again.

**Speaker A:** Look, looking back at the muddy water. Yeah, yeah, uh, at least from this moment it feels like waking up from insanity.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll stay awake. Wakey wakey. Yeah, don't go back into the doubt. Don't go back into the questions. Don't go back into the restlessness. Don't worry. Don't worry. Be happy.

**Speaker A:** Oh, this is really nice.

**Speaker B:** Um, Yeah, this is great. Just don't worry, everything's okay. You can't fix anything because nothing's broken.

**Speaker A:** Oh, is— yeah, huh? Yeah, yeah, it's, it's fine. So how can I sustain this? Like, later I want to be able to bring this.

**Speaker B:** Remember, okay, remember, oh, I can remember to look to see, oh, how can I sustain that? It's just another damn question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I see that and say, hey, I don't have to have the answer to that. I can just be happy right now.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, this is right now.

**Speaker B:** Never mind about the future. I'll remember when I'm in the future that I can think about right now. Everything's okay right now. I don't have to sustain anything, but I have to practice right now to develop the skills for later. So that later I'll have the skills to remember to stop asking damn questions and just be happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Um, so when I ask myself a litany of questions, they're never answered.

**Speaker B:** They're never answered. And even if you find the answer, you're not going to be happy. You're just going to ask another question. Answers to questions don't make you happy. It makes you ask more questions. Asking a question is developing the habit of asking more questions. So it doesn't matter how many answers you get, you're still asking more questions because that's your habit. Let's start developing the habit of stop asking questions and just be happy. I don't need the answers to any of those questions. I'm okay. Listen to the sound of the falling rain and just be happy. Don't have to worry about when the rain's going to be over or where the leaks are or anything. I can just listen to the sound of the sound, sound of the pounding rain, and everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** I just remembered Thailand. I've been to Thailand once, and it was the rain, wonderful rain.

**Speaker B:** Uh, you got good rain here.

**Speaker A:** Oh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no problems. Can you be here now in your room? Just listen to the sounds of whatever's happening around you and listen to the dogs lay on the floor breathing. Everything is okay. Or you can listen to the sounds of your own doubtful mind. What about this? And what about that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that ball of insanity is not any fun. The series of doubts, it's not— no, it's kind of yucky, actually.

**Speaker B:** So never mind, we're okay. Can you say that? You're okay right now. Everything is fine. Everything is okay. Yeah, you don't have to say, oh, being doubtful is yucky. You can just say everything is okay. Not a problem in the world, not a doubt in the world. I'm okay. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm okay. You're okay. Everything is fine. Everything is safe, everything's secure, we're comfortable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, very much safe and comfortable, warm, cozy.

**Speaker B:** But having questions is not comfortable, so let's not have questions, let's just be comfortable. Yeah, everything's all right. Everything is fine. Let me hear you say it again. Everything is all right. Everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of a worry in the world.

**Speaker A:** Pleasant.

**Speaker B:** Not a worry in the world.

**Speaker A:** Nothing to worry about, right?

**Speaker B:** Nothing to worry about. Let the world take care of itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay. Nowhere to go and nothing to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and yeah, that's That's very comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's very comfortable. Got no place to go. Everything is just fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's nice, pleasant.

**Speaker B:** What a relief it is. So can you practice this?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** You can practice?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** When you go practice, then you go practice just sitting, telling yourself, say it right out loud, everything is okay, everything is fine, everything is fine. Keep practicing, keep practicing. Not a problem in the world. Wow, everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, it's.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, can you practice that?

**Speaker A:** Easy. Yes, yes, constantly, right?

**Speaker B:** I want a commitment from you. Are you going to practice this?

**Speaker A:** Yes, but practice it constantly, constantly, and.

**Speaker B:** Every time you can think of it, because what are you going to do otherwise? Oh, full of doubt and asking questions. So be on guard for that. It's better to take a few minutes every hour or two and sit down and make sure that you're having happy, wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** To practice intentionally, I'm going to have happy thoughts for the next 5 minutes. Wow, there's no place to go and nothing to do and everything is just fine. Not a problem in the world.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. Oh, it's so much easier.

**Speaker B:** Certainly it is. So are you going to practice?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right, you go practice then. You go practice being happy. You go practice, practice catching those thoughts of doubt and worry and say, I'm going to worry anymore, I'm going to be okay. You keep practicing, that'll start to develop the skill and start letting those old habits rot away.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's finish the call now and you go practice. Okay, practice everything is all right, not a problem in the world. I don't have to have any answers to just be happy.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. We'll see you.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker B:** See you later.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** All right. See you later, Alligator.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), is a practical, dialogue-based session focused on **undoing habitual mental patterns of fear, doubt, and victimhood through intentional, repeated practice of feeling safe and happy in the present moment.**

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and teachings:

### **Core Teachings**

1. **The Root of Power-Seeking & Anger**
   - People seek power and act out of anger because they feel afraid and vulnerable, wanting to cover up that fear.
   - Trying to control others is a sign of being out of control oneself.

2. **Mind, Brain, and Conditioning**
   - The mind is the result of chemical processes in the physical brain, similar to software running on hardware.
   - Crucially, **you are not your brain, mind, or body**—they are temporary and changeable.

3. **Trauma & PTSD as a *Conditioning*, Not a *Condition***
   - PTSD is not a permanent state caused by a past event. It is a **learned pattern of re-stressing oneself** by repeatedly revisiting the memory and emotional response.
   - Just as one practices freaking out, one can **practice not freaking out**. It is a "form of bad training" that can be undone.

4. **The Habit of Victimhood**
   - People often "victim" themselves, repeatedly reading a "script" of being a victim, which recreates misery.
   - Labeling oneself a victim is a choice that perpetuates suffering.

5. **The Universal Human Blindfold**
   - Most people (≈99%) walk through life with a "blindfold" of old conditioning, seeing but not truly looking. They are trapped in habitual reactions.

6. **Learning from Animals: Play & Practice**
   - Skills are learned through playful, repeated practice in youth (like puppies playing with balls). Adults lose this playful openness, making new learning harder ("you can't teach an old dog new tricks").
   - This is why meditation must be **practiced over and over**—it's retraining the mind.

### **The Central Practice: Interrupting Doubt with Present-Moment Happiness**

The second half of the talk shifts from theory to direct, interactive training:

*   **Doubt as the Problem:** Dhammarato identifies Speaker A's constant questioning as a manifestation of doubt, worry, and restlessness. He points out that **answering questions never eradicates doubt**; only seeing and discarding doubt does.
*   **The "Alligator" of the Mind:** Doubt, worry, and manufactured stress are like imaginary alligators—they aren't real present dangers, but they cause real suffering.
*   **The Prescription:**
    1.  **Stop asking questions** about the future or past.
    2.  **Recognize** when doubt arises.
    3.  **Immediately replace it** with a conscious, present-moment **happy thought**.
    4.  **Practice this repeatedly:** "Everything is okay right now. I am safe, warm, and have no problems."
*   **Key Reframes:**
    *   Instead of feeling silly for being wrong, feel **grateful** for learning what's real.
    *   Don't wish you learned earlier; start **making it nice right now**.
    *   You don't need answers to be happy. **Happiness and doubt cannot coexist**—you must choose.

### **Conclusion & Commitment**

The talk ends with a direct call to action:
*   **Commit to intentional practice:** Periodically sit and actively generate happy, wholesome thoughts.
*   **Develop the skill:** Catch thoughts of doubt/worry and consciously say, "I'm not going to worry anymore. Everything is okay."
*   **Let old habits rot away** by consistently feeding the new habit of present-moment safety and contentment.

**In essence, this talk teaches that suffering is a practiced habit. Freedom comes from the deliberate, repetitive practice of recognizing the "blindfold" of conditioning—especially doubt and victimhood—and choosing, moment by moment, to see that in the here and now, everything is already okay.**

### Metaphors and Stories

The talk uses several powerful metaphors and stories to illustrate its core teachings about the mind, conditioning, and liberation from suffering. Here are the main ones:

### **1. Dog Training & Conditioning**
*   **Howling Dog:** Used to explain conditioning. You can't command a dog to howl, but you can reinforce a behavior it already does (like howling at a siren) with praise, turning it into a "song." This parallels how humans condition their own trauma responses through repeated practice.
*   **"You can't teach an old dog new tricks":** This common saying illustrates how habits (of thought or behavior) become ingrained. Puppies are playful and trainable; older dogs, set in their ways, are not. This is directly compared to humans—it's harder for adults stuck in mental ruts to learn new "tricks" like meditation or happy thinking, but it's possible with deliberate practice.
*   **Controlling a Dog vs. Controlling Yourself:** The speaker observes that when focusing on controlling a dog, they are not "at the helm" of themselves. The lesson: **The desire to control others is a sign of being out of control internally.**

### **2. Computer Hardware & Software**
*   **Brain = Hardware, Mind = Software:** This is the central metaphor for the mind-body relationship. The brain is the physical processor (hardware), and the mind is the resulting program (software). Key insights drawn from this:
    *   **You are not your "hardware":** "You are not your brain. You are not your mind. You are not the body, just like the processor in a PC is not Windows."
    *   **Software can be upgraded:** Trauma and negative patterns are not permanent conditions but **conditioning**—maladaptive software that can be rewritten through practice.
    *   **Serial Processing:** The brain/mind is compared to a computer that processes one thought/event at a time, "one by one as they occur," which is a basis for mindfulness.

### **3. Trauma as a Practiced Skill (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)**
*   **PTSD is not something that *happened* to you, it's something you *do*:** This is a radical reframing. The "post" means *after*. The talk argues that after a traumatic incident, a person **practices** the stress response ("freaking out") over and over until it becomes a disorder. Therefore, it can be "undone" by practicing the opposite.
*   **Guitar Playing Analogy:** Just as a child or monkey cannot instinctively play guitar but can be *trained* to do so, people are not instinctively "traumatized"—they are *trained* into a state of stress reactivity. They can likewise train themselves out of it.

### **4. Victimhood as a Script or Role**
*   **Reading the Same Script:** People who feel like victims are "reading the same script over and over again, and they don't even know it." They are unconsciously recreating the victim role.
*   **Walking into a Wall / Stepping in Dog Pile:** These are simple, vivid analogies for the self-sabotage of repeating painful mental patterns despite knowing better. "You keep stepping in a dog pile even though you know that there's dog piles in the yard."

### **5. Blindfolds and Refusing to See**
*   **The Blindfold of Conditioning:** Most people walk around with a "blindfold" made of their old conditioning. Ironically, a truly blind person navigates better because they pay attention to sensory input, while those with "eyes" (potential awareness) run into walls because "they're not looking."
*   **"None so blind as those who refuse to see":** This aphorism underscores that the problem is willful ignorance of one's own mental habits.

### **6. The "Imaginary Alligator" or "Panther"**
*   Doubt, worry, and manufactured stress are compared to an **imaginary alligator** chewing on your leg or a **panther** attacking you. The danger isn't real; it's a creation of the mind that causes real suffering. The task is to recognize there's no actual threat in the present moment.

### **7. The Train and the Truck**
*   A powerful story: A truck stuck on train tracks sees a train coming. The "big accomplishment" is simply to **drive the truck off the tracks** and interrupt the disaster. Similarly, painful thoughts are like a train barreling down on you. "All you have to do is step out of the way." The liberation is in the simple, intentional act of interrupting the habitual thought pattern.

### **8. Monkey Society (Ancestral Conditioning)**
*   The bickering and superstitions of chimpanzees in a zoo mirror human society. The point: "Humanity learns their worst traits from their ancestors." Our dysfunctional patterns are often just conditioned behaviors passed down, like monkeys learning superstitions from their parents or learning to use a cell phone by imitation ("monkey see, monkey do").

### **Overall Narrative Arc:**
The talk itself **becomes a story**—a demonstration of the very practice it preaches. It starts with Speaker A caught in a cycle of doubt and questioning. Speaker B identifies this as the "habit of doubt," and the **second half of the talk is a live intervention**, guiding Speaker A (and the listener) away from questioning and into the direct practice of having "happy thoughts" and recognizing that "everything is okay right now." The metaphors serve as tools within this larger story of moving from intellectual doubt to present-moment well-being.
