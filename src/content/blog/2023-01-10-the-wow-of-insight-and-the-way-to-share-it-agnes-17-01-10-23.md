### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Because I've talked to several people about traveling and Wat Soan Mokkh and all of that kind of stuff. But I understand, so we'll talk later. Let's first talk about that aha, wow experience of figuring something out, okay? To get it, to understand it, rather than have it as a rule or a memory or something that should be or whatever like that that we carry around them in in concepts, and then we bring those concepts back when we hear the Dhamma again, but now we're hearing it anew, we're hearing it afresh, and we're taking a different look at it. This is one of the reasons why I just talk about the same thing over and over again, but I say it in as many different ways as I can figure out how to say it. Repeat a lot because that seems to work. But hearing the Dhamma over and over again is part of the process. Just like the second grader who learns to read using phonics and the alphabet that she got in the first grade and whatnot like that. And so the child actually— and everybody's very happy the little girl can read. Right? You get what I'm talking about? Maybe by the third grade they begin to actually get it. But if she then gets the idea, "Oh, I'm a reader and I can read anything I want to," and then she stops reading, she's going to forget how to read. Just like children— in fact, one of the examples that I have, there was a guy who was He was born and raised in childhood in Greece, and then as a kid he came to the United States and didn't speak much Greek anymore. OK, and he wound up in a classroom that I was in, in ancient Greece, ancient Greek. And the ancient Greek teacher was actually quite famous. She was well known. I feel really fortunate to have had such an excellent teacher. But she kept referring back to him to get him to remember the modern Greek and how it fit together with the ancient Greek, and she helped the whole class doing it that way. So he was actually able to reconstruct the language that he had forgotten in childhood, because he really hadn't forgotten it, he just hadn't used it. But he did forget it, so we do forget those things. So the little girl who learned to read and then doesn't read for 15 years, and then she's an adult and she gets a book and she thinks it's interesting enough, she can actually learn to read fairly quickly, maybe by the end of the book. Okay, that's the Dhamma also, that happens many times within the Dharma that guys will go or women will go and fully immerse themselves in the Sangha. And then some event will happen 5 or 10 years later, and they come out of the Sangha. And then they're not around because of the emergency, like going home, and we got to go home and take care of business and whatnot like that. And so we're not we're not around the Dharma, and it kind of slips away. And then we come back to it, maybe by happenstance, just like happenstance got us out of it, we get back into it by happenstance, and then this time when we pick it up, we go, "Bang!" Wow, it's the aha, it's the old stuff that we have let settle. Plus reestablishing ourselves in the Dharma. And that sometimes is even a better experience, new, better experience than if we had stayed in the Dharma until it had gotten old, that we get out of it and then back into it. And so that's kind of what we're talking about here with your experience, obviously, that you hadn't heard this stuff a while. It had settled down and settled in. And then when you hear it in a talk again, you can pick that thing up and say, "Wow, now I get it, now I understand it. I had learned it, but I didn't get it.".

**Speaker B:** Is that sometimes necessary to do, to kind of get away from it and get back into it in a different way?

**Speaker A:** Oh, there are so many stories about that in science and in other places like that. It's in fact built into Japanese calligraphy art, when it's practiced in the Zen tradition, is that they take a while off after they get really good artists. Then they take a break for years.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And then they come back to it and now they're a master.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But they have to retake it up and relearn it again. But that new relearning process is speedy. And the insights come very quickly and much more profound. Okay, and we see that in many, many different places and cases, and that's one example where it's actually built into the tradition. This is also why I think that the Buddha was quite happy for people to leave the Sangha for a family business and then come back later. There's no problem with that at all, to where in Christianity they have the idea, we won't come back, but if you walk out of here, we're going to excommunicate you. We're going to rob you of your robe. You know, they're really heavy duty. And businesses are like that too. IBM was that way when I worked there. It says, if you leave here, you're never coming back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there is that idea in most things, I guess. Yeah, either you're in or you're out. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** If you quit coming to our church, you're off our list, you know. And so that's built in as human behavior, but it can be turned around in the sense of recognizing that and say, maybe taking a break is not a bad idea after all. And if they go out and then come back, they're actually going to come back because we do recognize the value of it. In a way that we didn't even recognize if we had just stayed in it. It becomes ho-hum, humdrum. But coming and going actually is kind of life-giving. And so, congratulations for having some new insights on some old things that we've talked about before.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but there were some new things too in there. That kind of, wow, is this in this context? You were talking about the eternalism and nihilism, and I heard about that a lot, and I kind of get that, and all of this rebirth, and so I don't— I understand that.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing to it. It's a boring topic. I have to really get myself in a good mood in order to be able to talk about rebirth and reincarnation. It's boring.

**Speaker B:** But you said something more. You talked about Nihilism. You said there is a person, and that one got to me in that context. And you were talking about this. When I started talking with you a few years ago now, you were talking about that, the mafia boss, and I can get away with anything, and the wrong view on that. And in this context, I kind of got it in a different way. So it was so revealing. I thought, yes. And then you also were talking about, you said instead of that, kind of it brings us to the Buddha was talking about Dukkha and Nirodha, that life becomes precious when things become dangerous and let's make the best of life and all of that. So it kind of put things in a whole different perspective for me. So it was really, really interesting. And yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that point is often forgotten because generally we don't get into a really dangerous situation. Our society protects us from that, and because of that, we're not really prepared for dangerous situations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, martial arts training is a good example of when the kid actually gets involved with actual combat with people and he makes it through, he survives, he's okay, you know, then we have that kind of experience so that we feel like that we can handle really dangerous situations in life. Yeah, rather than being unprepared for dangerous situations. But in any case, either one of those cases, the individual still in the dangerous situation gains kind of an insight into how precious life is. And I do not want to die right now, and I will do whatever it takes to survive this moment. Okay, this is the kind of feeling or experience that the Buddha talks about when he's talking about practice like your hair is on fire, practice like life itself is so valuable to you, because it is. When it comes down to it, you know, uh, uh, put up or shut up kind of situations, or put your money where your mouth is. Here we're putting our but where our brain is, and recognizing that our butt's in danger and how precious this poor butt is to me. Okay, and that's part of the insight that we get in those kinds of situations that we now can apply to the waking up process of gladdening the mind. That in fact, that gladdening the mind is to look at the fact that our life is so precious. And that also is what happens with old people when they become wise, as they recognize, "I've got not so much time left now. I can see the light at the end of this tunnel. It's going to be over soon. Let me enjoy the best I can right now." And in fact, the earlier we get that kind of feeling that life is short, life is precious, That's what gives us the impetus or the energy to go practice and find a correct practice so that we can get into actually experiencing and appreciating how marvelous it is to be alive. And what guarantees that it's marvelous to be alive is because we're going to die, we're going to lose it. So let's get ready for that. If we can get ready for that, we can get ready for anything.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, because I had that feeling when I started the practice many years ago. I had that. I really had that because I was in such kind of situation. But that got lost. I started feeling safer and safer and safer and safer. And it's kind of— so I kind of— I've been missing that and now it came again. In a slightly different way. But I've been practicing, and that's good because I don't have those horrible fears anymore like I used to have.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations! Isn't that marvelous that you don't have that tough stuff? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. So it kind of became less dangerous with time, but now it's in a different— yeah, the Arya is still there.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly the correct practice and process. We do, in fact, want to create a reality that's safe and secure. But we don't want to lose track of that fact that was so obvious when we were in danger. And that is how precious life is. Now, in fact, we have made life safe because it's so precious. So let's still celebrate and revel the fact that we're still alive. This is part of the Gradening of the Mind, or Brightening the Mind. Wow, we're still alive, here we are, I mean, isn't that marvelous? And so that comes with insight, but every time we have that insight, it gains that sense of joy and brightness again. To continue to renew that, to come out of the ordinary mundane life is safe and now I'm so secure and wow, I'm really grateful for the Dharma, to come out of that state into wow, I'm still alive, that's good Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it comes in slightly different ways, so it's kind of new. There are new things keep coming. In such a beautiful and wonderful way. It's kind of so amazing what happens.

**Speaker A:** Right, but it's natural for us in the sense of instincts, and it's normal for us in the sense that the society follows along with this, that we are to be afraid of new things, that we want to keep things the way that they were so I don't have to learn anything. We want to keep things the way that they were because I feel safe when things were the way that they were. But now you're gaining safety in the new things, which is wisdom itself. Because when the new thing comes, we keep looking at it until we understand it and we feel good about it while we're investigating it. That's what I mean by taking everything as a new toy and playing with it rather than being afraid of it because it's not what we know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. Oh, this is interesting because sometimes I'm so used to thinking I'm wrong and all of those things. So I become unsure sometimes, am I doing the right thing in a way?

**Speaker A:** Because now we can recognize that that's just a rule, that you don't have to be right all the time. It's better to be playful than to be right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I stopped being— every time I realize I'm right, oh no, not— I don't want to be right because I'm usually right about things that are not good.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, so we can turn right from wrong into I don't know and I don't care, or I'm not sure, but it takes both of those qualities because if we don't know, and that matters that we don't know because we should know, because we've got to get it right and so I've got to know that stuff, that mentality then leads us into doubt, insecurity, uncomfortableness. And then into not liking it without even learning what it is yet. We've already gotten ourselves into unliking it and not avoiding it because we think it's dangerous. Okay, that's the way that we were taught, and it conforms to our instincts. So we've got to use wisdom on the other side of that to recognize not only do I not know it, but I don't have to know it. I don't need to know that. I can be quite well and do quite well without having that knowledge. Now that's real freedom. Freedom from the burden of having to know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I started to see that in later time, that that's a thing for me. That's really what I've been struggling with a lot.

**Speaker A:** Well, now you don't have to struggle with it anymore, it's a toy, and when you get tired of playing with it, set it down, never mind, I don't need to know it right now, I'll play with it later. And so we pick it up not with doubt and interest and foreboding and caring, instead we pick it up and investigate it anew, as if it were a brand new toy to play with, that it's not dangerous, it's been there all along.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sometimes I can't differentiate between when it's kind of a toy, and because I can become obsessed too with getting into things to know, I get kind of high on that. And I assume that's a different thing because I'm not happy in that state. I'm kind of kind of dead in a way, but I'm kind of absorbed in knowing. It's still a high, it's a high in a way, but it's not a good high like this. It's a big difference between this I experienced with the Vipassana thing and.

**Speaker A:** That's partly because we forget to add the joy to brighten the mind, that we leave the mind in an ordinary state, and so we can actually brighten the mind to take a look at it. That's partly the attitude of changing it into a toy rather than an object that needs investigation. It's now a new toy to play with. It's not dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I don't really get that play thing, but I just— When I see what you talked about with the flower, that's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's because a little girl was really curious and she was actually playing with that flower. But in fact, by the time she really understood that flower, she may have destroyed it, one petal at a time. Because she saw the petals coming off as not dangerous. Nobody taught her, "Oh, you should not do that with a flower." Oh, you should leave them beautiful and let them wilt and die on their own. Not okay to take a flower apart, but that's in fact the way that we learn anything, is by taking it apart, even if we destroy it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Including taking the self apart, knowing that we can't get it back together again, that we'll come out with I don't know who I am. You see, that's what the whole point about personality view is all about, is that many people think they know who they are, and they define themselves in ways that are always talking about something that they're not, like lawyer or doctor or professional of this or that, or teacher. They talk about, I am what I spend time doing.

**Speaker B:** I actually never got that because I couldn't relate to that ever. I've been trying to do that, to become normal, but I don't get that.

**Speaker A:** Right. Congratulations. But there are other ways that we identify as to who we are, like the gender.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And some people really don't like people playing with gender. They don't like it because they get really established in the gender that they're in, and they don't like that other people can play with gender, that gender bending is a game to play. And many people are willing to play the game until they recognize that it's not worth the effort. But in any case, that's one example. Okay. These things are called actually not only instinctual, but we can call it confirmation bias. So when we go around, we go around finding data that we already agree with. We confirm our bias by what we're looking for on the internet. In fact, that's how Google works. They fix it up so that they only feed you stuff that they know that you'll be willing to watch. Okay, so that's how strong that we're built in. But Google knows that and takes advantage of it We do it and we don't know it and we get burned by it. Rather than keeping an open mind, all we look at is things that confirm what we already believe. That happens with people in political parties, but it happens to every person, including about my meditation practice. We have confirmation biases about it. So there's all kinds of ways that we are not able to look at the way that things are because of these biases. That's why the Buddha keeps recommending, "No, we keep looking, we keep looking, we keep rinse and repeat, and look and look and keep looking," because if we look and then decide that we know what it is, then all we have is a new concept, a new rule, a new law to live up to. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** To recognize that, is that when it becomes suffering? When I see that? I see, oh, I'm doing this and.

**Speaker A:** That'S— And I would be better off not doing it and so we stop doing it right then and there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the thing, to recognize it for myself that this is bad for me. And I see my problem, so to speak, the difficulties with doing that. And then when I see it, I kind of stop doing it eventually or immediately sometimes, but it could take some time because I have to keep seeing it to be able to kind of let it go. Is that it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, and we need to practice letting that stuff go. In fact, I remember from long ago, some of the things, some of these ceremonies were New Agey, some of them were quasi-religious, but there is one kind of ceremony that happens where people either bring an article of the past and what it represents, or they at least write it down on a piece of paper. And then in the ceremony, they'll read off or point out what this is and what I'm attached to out of my past, and then they throw it into the fire with great celebration by everybody around. And that ceremony sometimes has an enormous amount of insight for people.

**Speaker B:** We did that. At the retreat once we did that a long time ago. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because that has a great big impact, but it was only one event. We need to keep practicing that every time we remember that all that comes from this old thing, and I renounce that, I renig it, I throw it out. That's not who I am. My personality does not need that. And that's how our personality changes, is because we keep throwing stuff out of it until it gets pretty empty. And then who the heck are you? Nobody knows, because you're light and airy-fairy, and you know, you're not much of anything. So this is the way that we're looking, is to take those kind of things, that we would do that in a ceremony Like for an example of anger at my dad for doing something and carrying that around, okay? That would be one thing that a young man would do, is to throw out his anger for his father. That would be life-transforming for him.

**Speaker B:** Okay?

**Speaker A:** But he has to keep remembering to do it over and over and over again. But that event may be the emphasis that helps him to remember. Over and over and over again, that I'm not going to hate my father. That's just one example.

**Speaker B:** Is this compared, not compared, but in relation to the turning to the good things, to do something to keep that away, is that to focus on something good?

**Speaker A:** I would say that good feelings, like the feeling of safety, security, comfort, satisfaction, the feelings of success, the feelings of joy, these things are so missing in our society, they almost become a commodity. And so people will put on a happy face for a movie, because people go because they enjoy that kind of thing, and then something happens and everybody feels sad by the end of the movie. So, there is a lot of that kind of thing, and I'm pointing to you that your own joy can become a commodity. Except that you're not selling it, you're giving it away. Okay, and so your joy, then we build that up as a reserve so that we can give our joy to other people. That's what a student just recently asked me, that question about, in the sense of, what is my duty of the Dhamma? To other people? What is my relationship? How should I deal with other people? And the short answer was, smile and give them a happy face. Yeah, right. That's what we owe everyone. We owe everyone a smile and a happy face.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah. Well, I started thinking back too, because before it actually was so dark, there was almost no joy inside of me, but I could keep a happy face because I think people see me as a happy person in a way. I don't know why, because they say— but when I talked about my— But they like it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** They like that you give them joy. I know that you give them joy. And then when we were in conversation, you discounted rather than own the fact that you can present joy to people.

**Speaker B:** I started to realize that lately.

**Speaker A:** You can do this, you do have the joy, I can see that. I've seen that in you for a long time and every time we talk about it you discount it, it's not good enough.

**Speaker B:** Could that have to do with because for such a long time inside I felt this dark, the deadness, that was who I was to me.

**Speaker A:** So let's have a little ceremony. Let's take that darkness, that deadness, ball it up and throw it into the fire and say, every time I think about that dark deadness kind of thing, I'm going to say it's over now. Yeah, I'm going to replace that with joy, real genuine joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but that's what's happened. I started to realize that lately, actually. Because people have kept saying to me, they've been talking about the joy and all, and I never felt it. But over time, today I can say this joy comes from the inside. It's joy that I kind of give. It's real.

**Speaker A:** It's not— It is. I can tell. I'm an expert in telling feelings. I read feelings very often. It's a hobby of mine. Every face I see is a new toy to play with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And I caught you in several ways because now you are admitting that the joy is actually real. Yeah, but it gets clouded by this darkness that keeps popping its head up. So now become aware of that, and every time that you catch it, you can say, aha, I see you, darkness, my old friend.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I do it in a happy way now because I'm happy to see it so I can throw away.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker B:** And it's not usually, it's not even bad. It's different now because before when I saw it, I got so scared. I didn't know what do I do now. I got kind of paralyzed by it. But now I see it's not a thing that's permanent, maybe. I thought it would last forever and ever and ever, and I'm never going to be able to get out of this. But I don't see it in that way.

**Speaker A:** It's not like that, though. There's nothing that can't be described. That's how we think that. We begin to think that way as children, that time is very long. When you're an old man, the days just click by just like that. Okay? But when we're very young, we think we've got all the time in the world. And then we keep that opinion without catching up in time to recognize that no time's apace, and every moment is a new moment for us to either enjoy or live in darkness. And like you, everybody goes back and forth and back, almost as if it was a dance or a tango about giving the joy and then going in, "Your joy is not good enough." And, "Oh yes, it is." And so instead of doing that dance with it, the next time those feelings come about, "Oh, you're so dark, you can't do anything, your joy is artificial," you say, "Aha, I see you. I recognize you, old friend.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually it has become a friend in a way nowadays. It wasn't a friend before, but it was the worst enemy.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. And so therefore we don't even know when it comes because it comes from behind, sneaks up on us, and there we're in that darkness. But now we're waking up to that dark side by not being afraid of it anymore. It's part of our nature. It got us here. Without it, we probably wouldn't have survived.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And so it's actually an important quality that we need to make and befriend that so that we can cooperate together and the mind becomes unified or whole rather than in this back and forth tango dance that we're in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you talked about this too, was it yesterday or the day before, to recognize in hindsight what we were in the past, the self. So is this that?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's that darkness that we're talking about. For you it's feeling dark, but when we want things, we all become bullies. We all become thugs. We all become that 2-year-old tyrant. We do it. We learned how to do it. We got what we wanted occasionally by being tough, and so we go out and we be tough. But mostly where we're tough is with ourselves on the inside. We bully ourselves. Yeah. Okay. And that dark side can become the bully. Oh, you're not joyful, you're just putting that on, okay? So that's a bully, and we bully ourselves. And so, recognize that that bully has actually saved our butt from time to time, because we really weren't watching what was going on. But now that we have practiced Anapanasati so that we remember to actually look at what's going on, we don't need the bully doing the bully job anymore. But we don't want him to die, we just want him to cool down, which is the Nibbana. Just take it, take it easy. Okay. And reality is, is that you are joyful enough to spread joy to others. That's, that's real. And you don't have to bully yourself into, into the doubt.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're already good enough, Agnes. You're already good enough. Yeah, you don't have to improve anything at all. You're already good enough. So now you can just relax and make friends with all the stuff that you thought you had to kill off.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the thing is, I never wanted to be good because people wanted me in a certain way, and I was.

**Speaker A:** Kind of very Oh, and they call that good, right? Do what we tell you to do. Yeah, we've discussed that a long time ago. That's your definition of good. That's your confirmation bias. Uh-huh. And so, so that's where that dance of doing what you're told to do, not wanting to do it, feeling bad about doing it, then we rebel. And then we feel guilty for rebelling, and then we go back and do what we're supposed to do, and we be the good little kid again. But down inside, we still resent it. We still want to rebel. We don't like doing it. And guess what? Every adult that I know of goes and spends their whole day at the office just like that. Yeah, doing it because they're supposed to. Yeah. And then not liking it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then rebelling against it. And then feeling guilty for rebelling against it, and then go back and do what they were told to do again. And we're in that cycle every day.

**Speaker B:** But maybe that's why they like me, because I don't do that.

**Speaker A:** You don't have that cycle. Yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** And this has almost become a problem for me now in the work situation, Because maybe they're jealous of you.

**Speaker A:** What? Okay, because they're jealous of you. That's why. Because they're stuck in a cycle that you've gotten out of over the years. Okay. You do not understand how much I appreciate you, Agnes. You really have made some marvelous changes, and people appreciate that, and then they get jealous. I've had people jealous of me for a long time too. I know what it's like to be stabbed in the back.

**Speaker B:** I didn't know that. But at the same time, they're very kind and supportive. And I get confused by this because I started to realize it's not kindness. Actually, I got some kind of shock now lately because I started seeing it. It's not what I thought. What is this really?

**Speaker A:** It's a mixed bag. And it comes and it goes because they're caught in that same cycle. And so they'll appreciate you for a while and let you know, and then they'll resent it because they don't have what you've got, and they'll let you know that. And then they'll reform and appreciate you again and let you know that. And so they're caught in the cycle. You need not be confused about them caught in the cycle when you can see that that's the cycle that they're in. Rather than, oh, they do this and then they do that and then they do this. Oh, what the hell is happening here? They do recognize that, oh, that's their cycle. I see it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. Yeah, this is, uh, this is a big insight. Thank you so much for this, because that's, that's what's been happening. Really, and there are also— I can see the difference between the people who are genuinely kind and those who are not. It's a big difference. So yeah, that's it. Thank you so much. Because I usually take the thing on me, but I need to start seeing that I'm doing what I can, I'm not doing anything wrong here. And yeah, you're okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you already got what you need. Yeah, and you still need to give them that happy face and that smile. Yeah, whichever side of the coin you're on in the moment, it's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, and in fact, this is so easy. All you have to do is to develop the habit of remembering to be kind to people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that's also something so very new, but actually it's been happening lately. I can't stop myself from doing that, even if I would like to kind of punish someone. I'm not going to give them this, but I'm not able to do it even. It's too painful to me too to get into that kind of state nowadays.

**Speaker A:** I know, and we also have the wisdom of knowing that if you pay them back, they'll pay you back. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** And then I get back into this, I'm going to win.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to win this, I don't care how much damage we do to each other. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And then, oh no, this is a big no-no. Get back to this other, the joyful state. Yeah, but sometimes it takes some turns and what I experienced, there were a few days I really got thrown back into, oh no, what's happening? You know, I got really low. But It kind of changed by itself almost. And I came back. I don't know what's happening. It's kind of a miracle what's happening compared to how it used to be. And everything just works by itself in a way. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** And that's exactly right. And you remember that phrase, just enjoy the show. Yeah, we don't have to figure it out. We don't have to know the ending of the show. We don't have to take on a favorite actor on the stage. We're just enjoying the show.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the way that— especially for people who are into politics, they need to come out of it as something that's important and necessary and just enjoy the show. Even if this party or that party causes a war and everybody in Europe is in a famine, we can't do anything about that other than just enjoy the show. That's all we could do is just enjoy the show, because Putin is not going to listen to me. In fact, trying to make him listen to me sounds like a very dangerous thing to do. And so that's the attitude, to have a joyful, playful attitude that not only is it a show, but it's a comedy tragedy. It's a tragic comedy, they say. Okay, accept that it's your choice. Are you going to stay with the farce? Are you going to stay with the comedy? Or are you going to go over to the tragedy side?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Is that also a thing to maybe not strive to give Putin advice, to kind of keep out of that?

**Speaker A:** Actually, it has no bearing on Putin or anything like that. It only has bearing within one's own life. Mind. Okay, so not giving Putin a thought is the easy way out. Just don't think about him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but if I'm in that environment with those kind of people, would it be better to not be in that place?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's better just to not be in those kind of conversations. But if you get trapped into one, then the way to handle it is my 'Look at Putin, what a joke he is. He's a clown.' Okay, and get everybody lightened up. 'Yeah, Putin's just a clown. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's not in charge of this and in charge of that. He's really gone down a rathole, hasn't he?' That's the way to help with those people, because they need to see it like that. Otherwise, they're going to be terrified.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Ain't it awful they play? Isn't it a tragedy? We should do something about it. This little gang that works at this office, let's get in the car and go to Moscow. We're going to do something about that dude. And we all have that in the back of the mind. We want to fix Putin rather than enjoy the show because we can't we can't fix him, but we can fix our own attitude about it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So that just because Putin is in Ukraine doesn't mean that Putin has to be, in my mind, invading my Ukraine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Because Ukraine is not my business. Putin is not my business. When I make it my business, I suffer. What a burden. And you can actually teach people that when you get called into those conversations. "Oh, I don't worry about Putin." And they'll say, "Oh yes, you have to worry." I say, "Well, it's a comedy or a tragedy. Which are you going to choose? You choose tragedy, I choose comedy." And they'll say, "Do I have a choice in this?" You mean I have a choice about the way I feel about Putin? And that can all be done with great joy. Give them an insight, get that little girl in them to pluck at that petal of that flower, pull it off Putin, hahaha!

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah, I usually do that, but I kind of say I'm kind of strange, I'm weird, you know, but I think like this, and I think I think that's what—.

**Speaker A:** But everything is weird until you get to know it. Of course you're going to be weird to people who don't understand your new point of view. You've got Dhamma as a friend now. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, is that it? Because— and they say, oh no, you.

**Speaker A:** Think you're weird, you think you're weird, and you ain't got nothing on me about being weird.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because they say, oh no, you're not weird. They're trying to calm me to not think like that about my Buddha. I kind of joke about it in that way.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy being weird.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I am. I am.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's great. Just enjoy the heck out of it. And so when they think you're weird, you can actually take that moment to teach them something with that happy face. And that happy smile and say, oh, there's nothing to whatever. Yeah, that Putin, oh, he's not my problem. Exactly. Oh, you want to worry about Putin? Okay, here, here's a Putin, you worry about this Putin. I'm— I don't need Putin. And they'll say, what? I don't want Putin either. This is good, he's going down, you don't need him either.

**Speaker B:** But it's almost everything they talk about, it's like, oh, I have I have nothing to say, or I say something, you know, they're talking about the weather and all those things. Okay, okay. It's like, oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's get back to Putin. I imagine that Putin is the number one topic in Sweden.

**Speaker B:** That too, everything. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Putin this and Putin that, and everybody's terrified. And you can be very joyful about Putin.

**Speaker B:** I say, I'm not into politics, I don't really like politics much.

**Speaker A:** You can actually like it in the sense of being joyful with him. Instead of telling him, "Oh, you're not interested," you can say, "Oh, Putin, what a joke! I really enjoy the show. I'm not really into it, but the show goes on, and the show must go on." And so we watch it and we enjoy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's who— instead of telling them, oh, I don't want it, then that's withdrawing yourself from them. No, you want to go right into the friendship circle. You want to join with them.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay. So that's what I do, because sometimes I do withdraw, but I've been trying to kind of stay into things and I don't really know how to relate to it sometimes, and I just keep.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I just, I just told you how.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it makes perfect sense. Of course that's the way to do it, is that Putin's not important in this room. Yeah, that's another way you can say I don't see a Putin. Is there a Putin here? Start playing with it immediately. Yeah, Putin. Everybody in Sweden looks at everything they see as Putin. He's not here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So talking to them like that and getting them to wake up that they're making their own misery when they talk about, ain't Putin awful, and how bad things might get, because things haven't gotten that bad. They're still talking about it while they're at work. If things were bad in Sweden, they'd be talking about this in the basement of a burned-out rubble. Right? But they're not in Ukraine, they're in Sweden, and yet they're still in just as much misery about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's more like feeling sorry for those who come here. There are a lot of Ukrainian people here and they kind of feel sorry for them.

**Speaker A:** Well, instead of feeling sorry for them, feel joyful that they made it out alive, that here they are in Sweden. Them get set up, rather than, oh, you poor dear. Oh, I know how bad things are in Russia. Oh, let's get back in our car and go to Moscow and do something about that, dude.

**Speaker B:** I think it's a lot of that mentality here. They put themselves above others, feeling sorry for other people. Yeah. And I don't do that. I'm not that kind of person.

**Speaker A:** You might run in the next week, you might run into somebody who becomes a lifelong friend of yours.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Everyone from Ukraine is actually looking for love, and if you give them some, you might be able to find some really good, interesting people to befriend and actually give them some Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S, I mean, This is the Dharma for you. And so that's a good idea, is to befriend some of those people, because I know that there's a lot of refugees. People are leaving and have been leaving Russia for the past year. And the first ones out got all the best places. And now the newcomers who finally have put up with the situation long enough that they finally decided to get out, They get— it's like being at a buffet that's already been emptied by the time you get there. There's slim pickings left, that the Swedish people have already doled out everything they have to dole out, and then the new Ukrainians come, there's nothing left. So now it's your turn. And so, having that attitude towards them is a much, much better attitude than having the attitude like all of the other Swedes, "Oh, we've been put out so much. Another Ukrainian, oh no!" So, when you see them in that kind of position about the people, because now their object is no longer Putin and hatred for Putin, but we've got the representative of Putin, the Ukrainian refugee, right in front of us. So now we can take our anger at Putin out on this representation of Putin. This is called the scapegoat.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It's to find someone who's not responsible and make them suffer. Because you can't get at the right dude who you're angry at. And so playing with that would be something that would be very valuable for you in dealings with the Swedish people there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I need some tips about how to handle people because I'm not the best to do that.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you can handle it though. You can handle it. Don't put yourself down like that. I heard you do it again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm not— yeah, maybe I'm doing it, but I'm not aware of it really.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you're the winner. Yeah, you're the winner. You can do this. You can handle anything.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I got this thing that, you know, in Sweden you're not allowed— it's not like American people here. I think they see themselves in a different way. Here in Sweden, we cannot put ourselves above anyone else, so we do it in a different way, I guess. You cannot say you're good, or perhaps that's everywhere, I don't know. So I guess I've been learning a lot from American people because they present themselves in a different way, and I really like that. To learn from that because.

**Speaker A:** That'S— I'm not so sure that you can learn so much from Americans as the average American could learn a whole lot from you. Now, the important point though is not your relationship with Americans or the distinction between Americans and Swedish people, but the real issue is how can you work with the Swedish people in order to give them a happy face and a smile.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I've been doing that unconsciously. That's also what I discovered, that people— before I only saw negative people and all of that, but perhaps they reflected me in a way. But now everyone I see is happy. And I started to realize I might have something to do with that because I look at my family.

**Speaker A:** You just might, that's right. That good cheer rubs off. That's a very important point, in fact it's called Mudita.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** There's a Pali word for it and it is translated as sympathetic joy, but that's just a ho-hum word, sympathetic joy. We're talking about real smiley faces. Real genuine joy is what needs to be transmitted. Sympathetic joy, because when you are really joyful, they will come in symphony with you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's it.

**Speaker A:** They will harmonize with you if you keep giving them the joy. But if you're sometimes the joy and sometimes not the joy while they've got all anger all the time, then the anger is going to be the music that's played, and you interact with the anger. But if you keep coming back with joy over and over again, let their anger come and go, and you keep coming back with the joy, pretty soon they get in sync, in tune with you. Yeah, but it takes a while.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** If you've got the joy. So instead of delivering joy with a teaspoon, deliver it with a steam shovel. Deliver your joy with a truck. Just, you know, just drown them in their joy, in your joy, rather than allowing them to win the argument with, 'Ain't Putin awful?' or, 'Ain't the Ukrainians awful?' or whatever it is. In fact, that's the kind of a joke that you can make. Oh, ain't it awful? Oh, ain't that awful? But you'll have to see it in Swedish. I don't know how to say it in Swedish. Oh, that's so terrible. Oh, what bad news.

**Speaker B:** That's funny.

**Speaker A:** But we have to remember that we have that option. We have the option to make this thing a game, a toy to play with. You don't have to get met with their negative thoughts by being bowled over by them or have to confront them or any of that kind of stuff. We're playing a game that's much more like jujitsu, if you want to use some Japanese, okay? The softer question.

**Speaker B:** Now I get the playing the game. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is all a happy toy, a new game for you to play. Yeah, this is not serious. They're serious. You're not serious anymore. There's no seriousness to it. Seriousness is a quality that's added, like people add salt to food that they get at a restaurant before they even taste it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** We just salt that thing down. Okay, so now we recognize, no, it's better to really taste carefully because things may be just okay, just like they are. No salt necessary. And the way that Putin is delivered in Sweden, he's already pretty salty. And every time we get a salty Putin, we add more salt to it before we take a bite of it. And so these kind of images can help you to work with your joy. Let's not salt things down, let's put some sugar on it.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S already too salty. Agnes, this has been a really delightful conversation. I think I've given you about as much joy as we need right now, and I am so happy to see you again, and thank you so much for this conversation.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you again. I'm really glad that you were on the Sangha call. I hope that you're on the next one on Sunday. We do that every Sunday. Okay, yeah, which is 10 or 11 or something like that in the day for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, my dear friend, glad to see you again. Glad to see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend named Agnes (Speaker B), revolves around the themes of **rediscovery, joy, and integrating Dhamma practice into daily life and relationships.**

Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Themes & Insights**

1.  **The "Aha!" of Rediscovery:** Dhammarato emphasizes that deep understanding often comes not from continuous study, but from **stepping away and returning afresh**. Like a child relearning to read or an artist taking a break to become a master, leaving and re-engaging with the Dhamma can lead to profound, joyful insights that surpass rote learning. Agnes confirms this, experiencing new clarity on familiar teachings like nihilism/eternalism.

2.  **Life's Preciousness & Urgency:** The talk connects the profundity of practice to the recognition of **life's fragility and the certainty of death**. True practice is done with the urgency of "your hair being on fire," which fuels the energy to wake up and appreciate the marvel of being alive. Agnes shares how this feeling, which initially drove her practice, had faded with a sense of safety but is now returning in a new way.

3.  **Joy as Practice and Protection:** A major focus is on **cultivating and radiating genuine joy (Mudita)**. This joy is not just an internal state but a **practice and a gift to others**. Dhammarato advises that one's "duty" is to offer a smile and a happy face. This joyful attitude is also a skillful means to handle negative social dynamics without being pulled into conflict or despair.

4.  **From Investigation to Playful Curiosity:** The talk encourages shifting from a burdensome, serious investigation of life and self to a **light, playful curiosity**. Instead of analyzing problems with dread, one should approach experiences like "a new toy to play with." This disarms fear, reduces self-bullying, and makes the path joyful.

5.  **Integrating the "Dark Side":** Agnes discusses her historical struggle with an inner "darkness" or deadness. Dhammarato guides her to **befriend this part rather than fight it**, seeing it as an old survival mechanism that no longer needs to be in charge. Recognizing it without fear allows the mind to become unified and whole.

6.  **Dhamma in Social Dynamics:** The conversation gets practical about applying these principles in Agnes's workplace in Sweden, where colleagues are often caught in negative cycles of worry (e.g., about Putin/Ukraine). Dhammarato advises:
    *   **Don't withdraw or confront negativity directly.** Instead, **engage with joyful reframing** (e.g., treating serious topics as a "tragic comedy" to be observed).
    *   Use joy as "jujitsu" to soften hardened attitudes, offering a different frequency (joy) that others can eventually harmonize with.
    *   Recognize that others' mixed behavior (kindness/jealousy) often stems from their own internal cycles of obligation and rebellion, which Agnes has largely transcended.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a guided reflection on moving from conceptual understanding to lived, joyful wisdom. It highlights that the path isn't about constant striving or getting everything "right," but about **rediscovering freshness, cultivating heartfelt joy as a default attitude, and engaging with all of life—including one's own past struggles and current social challenges—with playful, compassionate awareness.** The ultimate message is one of reassurance: "You're already good enough," and from that place of sufficiency, one can relax, be joyful, and naturally extend that goodness to the world.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate points about Dharma practice, insight, and personal transformation. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Learning to Read / Relearning a Language:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **The Child Learning to Read:** Understanding the Dharma is compared to a child learning phonics in first grade, getting the hang of it in second grade, but risking forgetting it if they stop reading. This illustrates how continuous engagement ("hearing the Dhamma over and over") is necessary for true comprehension.
    *   **The Man Relearning Greek:** A man who spoke Greek as a child but forgot it relearns it quickly in an ancient Greek class because the foundation was there. This parallels returning to the Dharma after an absence; the insights come back faster and more profoundly because the groundwork was laid.

2.  **The "Aha" Moment as a New Toy:** Speaker A repeatedly frames insight not as a serious investigation but as **play**.
    *   Investigating a problem or feeling should be like a child getting a "brand new toy to play with"—an attitude of curiosity and joy, not fear or burden.
    *   This contrasts with the "obsessive" need to know, which is described as a "high" but not a joyful one.

3.  **Life as a Precious, Fleeting Opportunity:** Several metaphors drive this home:
    *   **Practicing Like Your Hair is on Fire:** The urgency of practice, recognizing the preciousness and danger of life.
    *   **The Wise Elder:** An old person who, seeing "the light at the end of the tunnel," decides to enjoy life fully now. The lesson is to adopt that perspective earlier.
    *   **Martial Arts Training:** Surviving actual combat teaches you the preciousness of life and prepares you for danger, unlike a sheltered existence.

4.  **The Mind's "Dark Side" as a Character:**
    *   The internal critic, doubt, and darkness are personified as an **"old friend"** or a **"bully."**
    *   The practice is not to kill this part but to **befriend it**, thank it for its past protection (e.g., keeping you safe), and ask it to cool down (a state of *Nibbana*). This transforms it from a sneaky enemy into a known, integrated part of oneself.

5.  **Salting Food Before Tasting:** This metaphor describes **confirmation bias** and adding unnecessary negativity.
    *   People add "salt" (preconceived seriousness, negativity, fear) to situations (like news about Putin) before they even "taste" the actual experience. The wise approach is to taste first (assess reality) and choose whether to add "sugar" (joy) or "salt."

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Japanese Calligraphy Artist:** In Zen tradition, an artist who becomes very good is instructed to take a break for **years**. When they return, they relearn quickly and become a true master. This story institutionalizes the "leave and return" cycle as a path to deeper mastery, applied here to Dharma practice.

2.  **The Flower Investigation:** A little girl learns about a flower by curiously pulling it apart, petal by petal, potentially destroying it. This is used to argue that true understanding often requires deconstructing something without fear of "breaking" it—**including deconstructing the self**. This playful, investigative destruction is contrasted with the rule-bound approach of leaving the flower intact but not understanding it.

3.  **The Burning Ceremony:** A story about a (New Age or retreat) ceremony where people write down or bring an object representing a past attachment (e.g., anger at a father) and throw it into a fire. This **ritual of release** provides a powerful, memorable insight, but the speaker stresses the need to continually practice that "letting go" in daily life.

4.  **Institutional Contrasts:**
    *   **Buddhist Sangha vs. Christianity/IBM:** The Buddha was happy for people to leave the monastic life for family and return later. This is contrasted with the stricter, more punitive models of some Christian churches (excommunication) or old corporate cultures like IBM ("if you leave, you're never coming back"). This highlights the Dharma's unique embrace of the "leave and return" cycle as life-giving.

5.  **The Office Tango / Cycle of Resentment:** Speaker A describes the common adult cycle: doing what you're told, resenting it, rebelling, feeling guilty, and returning to compliance. This story illustrates the pervasive suffering of inauthentic living that Dharma practice helps one escape.

6.  **Putin as a Comic/Tragic Show:** This extended analogy is used to teach **non-attachment to world affairs** and how to interact with others who are anxious.
    *   Global politics is a **"tragic comedy"** or a **"show."** You can't control the actors (like Putin), but you can choose whether to watch it as a tragedy (and suffer) or a farce/comedy (and maintain joy).
    *   Engaging with worried colleagues is framed as **"jujitsu"**—using soft, playful deflection ("Putin's a clown!") to redirect negative energy without confrontation, while offering a joyful perspective.

### **Recurring Symbolic Imagery**

*   **Light/Darkness:** Joy is "brightening the mind," while doubt and depression are the "dark side" or "darkness."
*   **Dance/Tango:** The internal struggle between joy and doubt, or the external cycle of compliance and rebellion in society, is described as a back-and-forth dance.
*   **Commodity/Joy as a Gift:** Joy is compared to a commodity that is scarce in society. The practitioner's role is not to sell it but to **"give it away"** generously—with a "smile and a happy face," even using a "steam shovel" or "truck" to share it.

In summary, the talk uses metaphors of **learning, play, and preciousness** alongside stories of **ritual release, artistic mastery, and social cycles** to guide the listener from a state of rule-bound, fearful practice to one of joyful, investigative, and resilient understanding.
