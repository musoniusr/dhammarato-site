### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So you probably heard before and probably surmised that I'm kind of like Johnny One Note. Yes, in the sense of you got a problem, forget about the problem. Yeah, recognize you got a problem and throw that out whenever it comes to mind.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** But in this case, she's not chasing you down the street. You say you don't have any money. That's okay with me. I don't care. I don't want your money. So you've got a past. So what? Everybody's got a past. Question is, can you be happy right now?

**Speaker B:** I can be happy.

**Speaker A:** All right, then the problem is solved because the only reason you had a problem is because you were unhappy thinking about it. Couldn't put it back to the way that I was speaking before. She's not chasing you down the street.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this is true.

**Speaker A:** So all of this is old guilt feelings. She's not making you feel guilty. You've decided to do all of that all by yourself. Well, she's probably hanging out in the bar with a new dude that's even more beautiful and handsome than you are, or wants to.

**Speaker B:** But I care about her. Okay, like, I don't— I don't want a romantic relationship with her, but I'm—.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's almost always what caring means. Well, you won't own them, you want to fuck them. That's all there is to it.

**Speaker B:** Well, trust me, this is— it's not worth the trouble.

**Speaker A:** It's not. It really is not. It's not worth the trouble.

**Speaker B:** So, so, but I still want to help her, and I, I know that we, we had a conversation in the Sangha about sometimes the best decision to do is to not make a decision. And that sometimes when you try to do good things, you don't know what's going to come out of them.

**Speaker A:** You don't know what's going to happen. So explain to me a little bit about her situation. Why are you so, let us say, worried?

**Speaker B:** Well, the situation is that she's got dissociative disorder.

**Speaker A:** She has— oh, another one of those labels, huh? You can't talk about her behavior, you gotta put it in terms where they can give her pills.

**Speaker B:** Okay, she's a weed smoker. She likes smoking weed. It'll be like a $300 a month habit. That is too picky choosing jobs. No, this one's not good enough. This one's not good enough. This job, I only want to work at a smoke shop or I want to work at a sex shop or work here, there, or whatever it is.

**Speaker A:** And so any help you give her is going to be wasted. It is going to help her in the way that she wants to be helped. Other than give them the advice that, hey, I know an island in South Thailand where you can get a job in a weed shop.

**Speaker B:** And I tried to share the Dharma with her. I, when I heard Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talk about Anapanasati and stuff like that, and then I heard the other talks. Now, of course, I'm not internalizing these things and applying them well at the moment because, well, I'm still caught up in the world.

**Speaker A:** But I, I think— here you are, so what? Average. But you see, you're not caught up in the world like bound to it full time. You're caught up in the world because you have thoughts about it on a regular basis. And when you stop having those thoughts, right then and there, you're not bound up in it. Don't see bound up as a long-term event. See bound up as something you're doing right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And I understand when you say bound.

**Speaker A:** Up, you're talking about personality view. People say, well, that's just how I am, or they're just good old boys. Or fruit doesn't fall far from the tree, or a leopard can't change their spots. This is actually part of our culture. And the Buddha is saying give up on that personality view. You don't have a personality view. You have personality thoughts from time to time, and at other times you don't have thoughts, especially when you're thinking about the Dharma You're not bound up. So don't see the personality view as permanent. It's not. It's temporary, moment by moment. Another way of saying it is, is that you do not know who you are because you are a moving target. Everybody's a moving target, but Dhamma dudes begin to understand that they're a moving target. And therefore cannot be defined. Who am I is a stupid question, because by the time you answer it, the answer's changed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're never the same person.

**Speaker A:** You're never— you can't step in the same person twice. If I help her, I wrote it, just said that, by the way. He was Greek. That was 5th century BC, in same time of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Okay, if I help her, I will be enabling her.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker B:** And this is what my father told me. He's like, I understand that you want to help, but at a certain point, you're like the story of the family that's caught up to the cow whose udders are giving just like barely enough milk. And the family is going to keep.

**Speaker A:** Jerking on them, right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And instead of moving to somewhere better and changing and everybody going their own way and trying to survive, they stay stuck to the cow, trying to milk the cow.

**Speaker A:** So need to get that cow a friend.

**Speaker B:** So I'm trying to understand Maybe it's that I want to be liked, or maybe it's that I want her to still like me and to still— maybe.

**Speaker A:** It'S like you're trying to— you want to get rid of your guilt feelings. You feel guilty about her, almost as if you failed her.

**Speaker B:** I did, because I I promised her that I wouldn't let her end up on the street. But the thing is that you can't.

**Speaker A:** Stop her from ending up on the street. So you promised something, a promise you couldn't keep.

**Speaker B:** I understand.

**Speaker A:** That's the reality about most promises. I've made a promise or two, and even years later I regret not keeping the promise. I regret making the promise because when I made it, I kind of knew I couldn't keep it.

**Speaker B:** And I've tried my best. I've, you know, I've liquidated stock holdings and IRAs and pawned stuff off and all of these things.

**Speaker A:** Just to feed her weed habit, I suppose.

**Speaker B:** Well, in part, yes, in part. But I told her, I told her, I don't want you buying weed with this. I don't want you buying weed with this or that.

**Speaker A:** All you could do is help her get on a plane, leaving on a jet plane to a place where grass is a whole lot cheaper than $300 a pound. Yeah, you can feed a nice, really heavy-duty habit here in Thailand for $100 every 3 or 4 months.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and then I'd go every week to drop food off, not just for her but for her friends, because she's living with roommates. So it's 3 people splitting the rent. Right now, I'm not covering the whole thing. In the past, I was not covering the whole thing. I'm just covering part of it. And then, like, the food, I'll buy enough for all three of them. I'll get enough for all three of them.

**Speaker A:** You've got three girlfriends you can't stand?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't have three girlfriends.

**Speaker A:** I only had— she's shacking up with two guys then? Is that what's happening?

**Speaker B:** No. No, it's two girls.

**Speaker A:** You see if I can guess again, huh? Let me see if I can make another guess. Okay, so these are, these are not three females together, and it's not one gal and two— is she a transverse type? Tell me what's going on here. I don't get it. You're paying the rent.

**Speaker B:** Yes. How did you know? Dhammarato, what's going on? How did you know that? Yes, my ex is transgender. Male to female. Yeah. It's just, you know, that's how I am. You know, when I was, when I was very little, I, yeah, I had a boyfriend. And then I liked it. It was like the emotional connection was good, but I just, I didn't get turned on. So that wasn't it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's all past. We don't need to talk about any of that. Here's a question. Do you have a job? Right now?

**Speaker B:** I'm a full-time student in university studying psychology.

**Speaker A:** Why? I mean, you're pretty bad at it right now.

**Speaker B:** I am so bad at it. That's why I went into psychology. I'm like, you know what, I can get a job and I can also fix my own shit.

**Speaker A:** And now, well, that's why we've got so many psychologists in the world who can't get a job and can't fix their own shit. In fact, the primary source for new psychologists is failed clients.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** You go into the psychologist, they don't get better, but they learn a whole lot about psychology. So they'll say, hey, well, at least I can get a degree in this and go around helping others just like I couldn't get any help. The business model of psychology dooms the whole practice to failure. It sets you into a one-up, one-down situation with people. The psychologist then begins to need his clients more than the client needs the psychologist. I learned all about that in graduate school.

**Speaker B:** I know, because that's the thing that caught me off guard, is that you studied clinical psychology, and I think you even got a PhD in it.

**Speaker A:** Something like that.

**Speaker B:** And then you ended up being a monk.

**Speaker A:** So at some point— that's because I was looking for the right answer. I tried all kinds of weird shit like he did.

**Speaker B:** So I think obviously eventually you just found out that being a monk was.

**Speaker A:** The better choice because I met Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. I met someone, I met Achan Po. I can't tell you which one influenced me the most. They each influenced me in different ways, but I knew that these guys had what I wanted.

**Speaker B:** I see it in people.

**Speaker A:** Gave it to me.

**Speaker B:** I see, I see it in Mikey, for example. When, when Mike— so do I. Mike, Mikey just smiles and he's just like, he doesn't need to talk all the time. He'll talk when, when it's like necessary to talk, and he'll just like, you know, he'll just enjoy the conversation. And then if, if there's like some problem, then he'll just laugh about it or something like that. And then You know, and when I see people like that, I'm like, well.

**Speaker A:** Why don't you come stay with him? He's here on the porch. We can put you up. We can find room for you. If you really want to know psychology, you're not going to get it from psychologists. You're going to get it by understanding your own mind. Because the human mind is all the same. Yes, everybody has PhD— I mean, uh, uh, attention to definite disorder. Everybody has post-traumatic stress disorder. Everybody's a bit schizoid. Everybody is bipolar.

**Speaker B:** I understand that, you know, you'll take some random person off the street and then put them by a psychiatrist or a psychologist and they'll pop out a diagnosis. There's nobody that is, you know, right in the middle of not having a diagnosis.

**Speaker A:** The only people that they don't diagnose are those who they never see. And there's enough people out there who are healthy enough that they don't need a psychologist, but there's far more many of them that are too sick to go to a psychologist, and that's why they won't go.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, if I decide that I want to become a monk, how can I go about that?

**Speaker A:** For example, with the Catholic— where do you live?

**Speaker B:** I live in Philadelphia.

**Speaker A:** All right, there's places in Philadelphia. Why don't you do a Philadelphia search on our website? Okay, but that's what the whole thing is for. I don't understand people who know us. They know we've got a website that has all of this data on it, and now you're asking instead of looking.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, I know, I know, I know that it's there. The, the question leads me to one thing, and it's that I have a diagnosis of bipolar.

**Speaker A:** Now I know for a fact— can you put that in your sock drawer? Put it in there with your Mickey Mouse socks and forget all about it, just like you've forgotten all about your Mickey Mouse socks.

**Speaker B:** But I know some places will not take me because of it. They'll be like, too much liability.

**Speaker A:** It's a bunch of crap. Forget it. And when somebody says, do you have some sort of diagnosis, you can say, I used to, but I forgot what it was. Just forget about it. In the time of the Buddha, they did not have those kind of diagnoses. That in fact, in the 1960s, they didn't have those kind of diagnoses. That in fact, it was in the 1970s when they wanted to have those diagnoses, and you know why they wanted them? It was because the insurance companies would not pay for any mental up. You see, in the medical profession, with medical doctors who work on the body, they have a diagnostic code for a broken bone on the leg, a femur, you know, a hip bone. They know pancreatic cancer. They've got all these diagnoses. And so the psychologists and the Sakyakravas said, we want those things too. And they've been adding to that book for all these years, and when they get the book full of diagnoses, maybe the insurance companies will start paying for it. Fat chance. That's the reason for those diagnoses, is because they want money from the insurance companies. The insurance companies are not going to pay for anything they don't know what it is, and they still won't pay for things when they do know what it is. How many stories have you heard about somebody who died because they were not able to stay in a hospital like the doctor wanted because the insurance company wouldn't pay? Or they didn't get the tests that they needed that would prove that they had something so that they could get the right kind of treatment for it? Well, that's 100% of all the diagnoses that you'll get from psychologists. They're irrelevant, they don't mean a thing. And we've already gone back to the point that you're a movie moving target. Those diagnostic codes are for a personality that's fixed.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** And you can change. That's the whole point about the Buddha. And so there's not going to be any— especially any Thai or Asian Buddhists— are going to give a flying rip about your diagnosis. Only places like Goenka's retreat, because they're run by Westerners who don't understand that personality is not fixed. This is what the Buddha means by Anatta. There is no permanent self. So forget about the diagnosis.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] They don't even work either way. I've— I kid you not, Dhammarato, I've taken like— I've taken like 30 different medications, and each one gives me some new shit. Like, I took, um— every one of.

**Speaker A:** Them has a side effect, often an unwanted side effect. It's not like Viagra. Viagra's the only drug they ever found that had a decent side effect.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Like akathisia from antipsychotics, or, you know, having to go get blood tested for lithium because you might be fucking dying from lithium toxicity, or all these things. And the benzodiazepines, you know, they gave me when I was 18 or something like that, or 19, they gave me, they gave me Xanax. Like candy, you know. Here you go, you're 19, 18-year-old, here you go.

**Speaker A:** If they can diagnose a drug for you, then they can say, my job is done, pay me. Yeah, that's the war basically between the psychologists, the psychotherapists, and the psychiatrists, because only the psychiatrist can dispense drugs, but psychiatrists don't do psychotherapy. They dispense drugs. So the psychologist may know a whole lot more about you, and they tell the psychiatrist what drug to give you, and the psychiatrist just writes it out. He's actually an inkjet printer in a business suit. That's all a psychiatrist ever was.

**Speaker B:** So is a monk just like a real psychologist? That's what it is.

**Speaker A:** No, I would say that those monks who spend an awful lot of time listening to an awful lot of bullshit from an awful lot of people begin to see that it's all a bunch of bullshit. Back to my Johnny One Note, let's get out of the bullshit. Never mind labeling the bullshit. You don't have to be a master psychologist to give people the diagnosis of stop having unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** I understand that.

**Speaker A:** Looking for love in all the wrong places. So in fact, the diagnostic code only has to do with where you've been looking for love.

**Speaker B:** I believe that's the problem.

**Speaker A:** And you'll get different diagnoses when you go to different doctors, when you're looking for love in a different place. Yeah, my favorite is, uh, Rath, who as a child came to the United States. He was Cambodian and he was in the Killing Fields. He spent 5 years in jail because he was in a car that was stolen, and he didn't even know that. But that's South Carolina for you. There they had entered— they diagnosed him as schizophrenic, and he started taking the medicines, and he wouldn't take it anymore. Because his family was from Cambodia, they wound up at the Cambodian Wat in Greensboro, North Carolina, which is where I was. And I took Ross under my wing, and I got him re-diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. I worked with a psychologist who finally convinced the psychiatrist that the psychiatrist in Spartanburg, South Carolina were madly wrong. But he had already had such a bad time with them in Spartanburg that he wound up refusing to take any kind of medication. The only medication he'd take was a six-pack. And so occasionally I'd give him the sick pack, knowing that it was against the law to do so.

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so from that We can— that's just what you would call empirical psychology. That's what you would call one example does not prove the entire system. But every example that I do have proves the entire system. Is not— OK, let me ask you this: You've heard about monks like Thich Nhat Hanh and Achan Samatha and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Achan Po and how highly revered they are?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of someone who went to a psychiatrist or a psychologist and got cured?

**Speaker B:** No, no, never. They just keep coming back.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker B:** And, and as a matter of fact, I think the only time that you know that you're well is when you stop going. Yes, when you just decide enough of this.

**Speaker A:** Not only that, but most psychologists will chase you down the street saying, you're not well yet, you're not well yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that— I mean.

**Speaker A:** Just like diet plans will chase a guy who's lost a lot of weight down the street, you're not thin enough yet, you're not thin enough yet, keep coming back and giving us money.

**Speaker B:** And of course when you do talk therapy, it'll be, oh yeah, and tell me how you felt about that, and then fucking let's open the wound again and let's, let's, let's like go back to the beginning of everything that happened. Maybe there you will really find— yeah.

**Speaker A:** We call that archaeology, uh, psychological archaeology. I've got some jokes about that. Yeah, the diagnosis was, is that, oh, he is, um, an asshole. That's actually a diagnostic code. And he's an asshole because he got a spanking when he was 4 years old, so the psychiatrist figured out because of all of the archaeology. The reality was, is that his mommy gave him a spanking because he was already an asshole. So much for, you know, psychological archaeology. It doesn't mean a thing.

**Speaker B:** That's very refreshing. But, well, no, but it's like Coca-Cola. Look, here's the problem, Dhammarato. Like, I agree with what you're saying. But the resistance is.

**Speaker A:** It's like, well, I'm not inviting you yet to move into the wat. I'm inviting you to go visit the wat and learn a few, make a few friends within the Asian community. One point that I'll make is, is that when the Asians want to start a wat, or when they're looking for monks in an already established wat, they'll often go to Asia to find them. It's hard for Laotian and Cambodian monks to get a visa, but Thai monks, they can get an easy visa for the Thai monks, thanks to the U.S. government and the Treaty of Amity. But here's the point: the lay people who are looking for a monk does not want a young monk who wants to come to America. They want an old monk who does not want to come to America and convince him to come out of his good nature and big heart. So you will often find old monks in the West, and that's true in the Theravada, is true in the Mahayana, is true in the Tibetan system. I'm not so sure about Japan because it's really, really, really hard for for Westerners to convince an old Japanese Zen master to come to the US. He's not going to do it, not having you. So I wouldn't trust the Zen places, but I'd trust the Tibetan, I would trust the Thai, I would trust the Cambodian, because almost always the Cambodian and Lao wats will have an elderly Thai monk.

**Speaker B:** There's a— there's a Cambodian wat near me.

**Speaker A:** There is. Have you been yet?

**Speaker B:** I have, I have been, I have been. I should go. I mean, that's, it's 40 minutes like there and back, but I can— well.

**Speaker A:** That'S 40 minutes in the psychologist's office.

**Speaker B:** And it's expensive.

**Speaker A:** And you can stay all day.

**Speaker B:** And I, I think they do— after.

**Speaker A:** You stay a couple of days, you can just move in. Sleep on the floor in the meditation hall.

**Speaker B:** Uh, but it's, it's very dangerous talking to, to people in the Dharma because now I got to stop going to university.

**Speaker A:** And then, oh, you can go to the university, but what's going to happen? You don't have to stop going to university. You can start seeing a university for what it actually is, and then you'll stop.

**Speaker B:** I know, but there's— that's why it's dangerous, because it's like the resistance is.

**Speaker A:** Like— so what you're saying is truth is dangerous? It's why? Because the truth will help you be freed from the lies you've been told, and you love the lies you've been told.

**Speaker B:** Yes. That's true.

**Speaker A:** We like what we've gotten used to.

**Speaker B:** It's what I told Mikey and Bhante, and I'm sorry, I forgot his name, is if you keep talking, I'm gonna shave my head and buy a ticket to go to Asia.

**Speaker A:** Because it's like, well, we're talking about going to the Watson Philadelphia. You can move in there too. In fact, if you get to the right kind of place, and I would assume that Cambodian wat that you're talking about If you keep going back over and over and over again, they'll be looking out for a size robe that'll fit you. I would, in a funny kind of little way, I was tricked into becoming a monk. You were? Yeah, by Achan Po. He set me up.

**Speaker B:** It's like, uh, what is it, um I don't remember the name, but the Muslims, it's like you give an attestation in front of somebody and then you become a Muslim, and it's like, oh, let's trick him. Then, uh, oh, they'll end up turning, and, uh, sort of like that, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Well, now that's psychology for you.

**Speaker B:** Is.

**Speaker A:** Trick somebody into doing something beneficial, wholesome, and wise for them themselves when they would rather hold a diagnostic code and go to school to learn something more about what it is that's not helping. So in this conversation, you originally called about trying to help a girl who you can't help. Girl in name only, a GI, a Jhino.

**Speaker B:** Well, Dhammarato, what can I say? What can I say?

**Speaker A:** Well, you can say I don't need to help her. Yeah, because you can't help her. That's the problem with helpers. My mom was a first-class, world-class helper. You know what's the biggest problem with a helper? They feel bad when they can't help somebody. They feel bad when they don't have anybody to help. Yeah, my mom respected me, she used me, I helped her, but she loved my sister so much more. Because my sister fixed it so that she needed my mom. And my mom spent her whole life, my sister's whole life, taking care of her because that's what my mom wanted to do. She was a helper. She was a nursery worker in the church.

**Speaker B:** And that can also be treated— she.

**Speaker A:** Tried— treated everybody like a child. And I would not remain a child. So here you are trying to help her, this poor little thing who's got a $300 a month smoking habit and can't figure out what shape her balls are in. You can't help her. And you know you can't. Look how hard you've tried. Look how much money you've already spent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and Dukkha, a lot of Dukkha, a lot, a lot, a lot of Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you didn't get your way. You see, you wanted to help her and you wanted proof that you helped. You didn't get— you didn't get the verification. So that means, oh, I've got to help harder. If I help hard enough, I'll fix her.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Maybe the best thing that could happen to her is that she doesn't see you for a while. She doesn't know what— why you're in.

**Speaker B:** Let's hope not, because if she finds out where I'm at, she's gonna start chasing me. I got her on the phone, that's how, you know, at arm's length.

**Speaker A:** Uh, so I was right, the first question I asked you was, is she chasing you? And the answer is yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know, she's not chasing me right now, but.

**Speaker A:** You know, when the money runs dry, she might.

**Speaker B:** Of course. I mean, I have no— look, I have no doubt about that. I'm telling— stop buttering me up to try to get money out of me. I'll help you either way. Like, like, yeah, you know, it's— and.

**Speaker A:** So you've ruined yourself financially trying to help her no matter what.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations. You're a man.

**Speaker B:** But I didn't get married. I didn't get married, at least because I was about to get married, believe it or not. Well, on the way to get married. I bought a ring, so that's, you know.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations on not getting married.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Now, one more thing, and that is, is that we have watched here on the island Yeah, we have Wat Suan Mok, we have Wat Khao Tam, we have Wat, uh, uh, Tanha, we have Wat Ruesipasiyantong just around here. We also have a wad in Royette, Wat Dam. We know a lot of places here in Thailand, but you're in Philadelphia and you got no money, so the thing to do is to start hanging out Look up Philadelphia on our Google Map and on our search. Type in Philly in the city field and see what you can find.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will do that. We'll do that. Yeah, maybe, maybe the best thing is I just don't do anything because I'm just— I'm ruining this person by being an enabler.

**Speaker A:** You probably learned that from your mom, though. I'm not making any statements about anybody in your family, but we do know from psychology that a girl who is raised in the family with an alcoholic father will more likely find an alcoholic husband. And after 3 husbands, she gets tired of having an alcoholic husband, so the 4th man she marries, she turns into an alcoholic. Yeah, that's an enabler for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You'Re enabling her to have a bad, uh, let us say, to have easy way to have a bad life. So you're just making her life easier while it's a miserable life. Instead of helping her out of her miserable life, which is what you want to do. And you can't do that, not any more than I can make you quit college. I can't do that. I don't even want to. The world needs more psychologists.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe there's— maybe there's still time to change majors. You know, maybe there's something more useful than psychology.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I'm not sure that it's going to be an easy transition into something really useful like electrical engineering. You see, psychology has 1 1 0, they have never figured out that 1 1 3. You know, 1 1 does not equal 2. 1 1 is equal to 1 1.

**Speaker B:** Is 2 something we don't know yet.

**Speaker A:** I did not know. Yeah, that's it. I don't know. I did not. 1 plus 1 plus something we don't know yet. I did not know. That's a Buddhist joke, not an electrical engineering joke. The electrical engineers will fight you over that one.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The whole basis.

**Speaker B:** Of mathematics is to.

**Speaker A:** Prove that one exists. Is it really? Yeah, long proofs. Because if you can't prove.

**Speaker B:** That one exists.

**Speaker A:** You can't prove arithmetic. Huh, that's very interesting. One is always one.

**Speaker B:** Plus something else we don't know quite yet. Do we have to find out?

**Speaker A:** I mean, does it really matter? No, we don't. Because why? Because right now things are good enough. Yeah, we can go with 1 plus 1 plus what we don't know don't hurt us. Ignorance.

**Speaker B:** Is bliss here.

**Speaker A:** Let's have it.

**Speaker B:** Too. Dhammarato, let me ask you a question. How did you know that my girlfriend was transgender? I want to know.

**Speaker A:** That was a pretty wild guess. I call that serendipity. Or maybe it.

**Speaker B:** Was that I had run out of options. No, come on.

**Speaker A:** That'S so like— I'm sure you saw something.

**Speaker B:** Well, her I haven't. Oh well. Only you. Yeah, these are old man tricks. It's like the Zen master tricks. Yeah. It did help though, when we talked about not judging things. Like I have, I'm not, I don't hate as much. I just, you know, I see suffering.

**Speaker A:** And then I can empathize with people. But you can't fix it. That's the whole point. Yeah. When somebody's dying in bed from pancreatic.

**Speaker B:** Cancer, the only thing you can do is fluff their pillow. And I'll tell you something, Dhammarato. When I had that first conversation with you, I literally went and cried all night. Like, because that was such a— I'd never heard that before, that there.

**Speaker A:** Is that, that good and evil doesn't exist.

**Speaker B:** Other than in your mind. I never heard that before, and I went through so many emotions because I'm like, what does this monk know?

**Speaker A:** It's like, what does he.

**Speaker B:** Know?

**Speaker A:** Thinks he's so smart. I know.

**Speaker B:** Nothing. Isn't that marvelous? I don't know nothing. But then I I came to realize that it's true.

**Speaker A:** And then, you know, what can you say about God?

**Speaker B:** You know, there's— don't worry, be happy. That's not— well, it's not a worry. No, it's not a worry. It's that, that I came to that realization that, that I, I can't, I can't say what he— what, what God.

**Speaker A:** Is or is not. So if I can't— but you hear a lot of people arguing like they think they know. So.

**Speaker B:** They get mad when you prove them wrong. If I say anything about God, it'd be intellectually dishonest. And if I can't say anything about.

**Speaker A:** God, then, you know, what does it matter? Like, I can't say— Can we stay with reality? Because reality, in fact, is the God that you're looking for. Yeah. All the way down to gravity and the electromagnetic and strong and weak nuclear forces, vectors, acceleration, all of the laws of physics, is a good enough God. I especially like gravity. Why? Because gravity— they say that God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent. Where do you know that gravity does not— it's not present everywhere? Is present even between the galaxies. That's why Andromeda and the Milky Way are making love with each other, heading for each other due to gravity. It's also pretty strong. I mean, look at the kind of rockets that we have to have to get rid of— get out of the gravitational field. Pretty strong stuff. And then not only that, but it'll get you when you slip.

**Speaker B:** You'll fall. Gravity is there waiting on you.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's a friend that's around. It's always around. Not only that, but we need gravity. It's absolutely essential. If there was no gravity, there'd be no atmosphere. No atmosphere, no breathing.

**Speaker B:** No breathing, no Santiago.

**Speaker A:** Well, no gravity, no planet Earth, no stars, no.

**Speaker B:** Nothing. Just nothing. Gravity, that's our God. Yeah. I can appreciate it better that way because then, you know, I don't have to— I don't have to— well, you know, original sin, why is there suffering? And we already talked about what that.

**Speaker A:** Meant, which I agree with. You don't like something, that's your suffering. Yeah, you did. If you liked everything, you wouldn't suffer. If you'd like that your girlfriend was transgender, smoking dope all the time and wanting your money And if you liked.

**Speaker B:** All of that, you'd be happy enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I could, but I don't like that. I don't like.

**Speaker B:** It. Change that mentality then.

**Speaker A:** Hey, it's okay.

**Speaker B:** But that— you're not telling me to.

**Speaker A:** Go back to her, right? No, I'm not telling you to go back to her. Of course. In fact, the best thing to do is to like what you've got right now. Yeah, because you can't go back to her. No, I can't.

**Speaker B:** But you can sit here and be happy. I can, I can be happy. It's crazy how that works. You just You just say to yourself, I can be happy. And it's like, yeah, I can be happy.

**Speaker A:** What a revolutionary fucking.

**Speaker B:** Concept it is. It is. It's absolutely anti-societal. It's crazy.

**Speaker A:** It's like everything is built against that.

**Speaker B:** The whole society is built against that. This is like, buy this shit, buy.

**Speaker A:** This other shit, fucking come, come become this, come do this, come vote, come.

**Speaker B:** Vote for us, join our army. And, and then, you know, it's like, I know people say that all the time. It's.

**Speaker A:** Like, it's nothing new. But it is revolutionary. Actually, in a way, it's also anti-revolutionary.

**Speaker B:** The Buddha didn't start any revolutions. Well, not in the sense of revolution. I mean, just like something so impactful.

**Speaker A:** To what's always that you can just throw all that stuff out. You don't have to fight with it. That's the revolution. You're trying to overthrow something like a government or whatever.

**Speaker B:** No, you just walk away from it. Yeah. And then now, now I like— even now, like, I see the use of not— of not going on YouTube and looking up debates, debate, like Christian debates Muslim, or this or that, or whatever.

**Speaker A:** It is, or street preacher, da da.

**Speaker B:** Da da da, because— Radimir versus Radimir, right? What's the point of looking at that shit? Because that's only gonna— it's gonna pollute the mind with negative thoughts, and then I'm feeding it and I'm reinforcing it. And even yet there's— when you start concentrating.

**Speaker A:** On something a lot, you start forming connections. So why don't you go form some connections at the Cambodian Wat or a Thai Wat? Yeah, go make some friends that are worth having.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, get yourself on a ticket to, uh, Thailand. Come on down.

**Speaker A:** No, but it's very dangerous, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** You know why? Because you might stay. No, because there's a lot of transgenders in Thailand. I might, I might, I might end up against it. I might.

**Speaker A:** End, I might end up falling in love.

**Speaker B:** Well, falling in love is.

**Speaker A:** Dangerous, not Thailand. It's not gonna, you know In fact, when you find that falling in love is.

**Speaker B:** Downright dangerous, you won't do that anymore either. It is, but I haven't learned the lesson. I haven't learned it yet. I'm still trying to throw the dice, that.

**Speaker A:** Biological dice, that instinctual dice. The habit dice. It's all habit. The question is, can you.

**Speaker B:** Change your habits? One thought at a time. Yeah, because there's a fear of missing out. You know what? What if the Buddha's wrong? And what if the monk is wrong? And And but then I see these people being happy and unmoved, and they don't give a shit about what other people say. They just like couldn't give a shit, you know. Somebody goes on here and it's like, oh yeah, well, that's not true.

**Speaker A:** That'S.

**Speaker B:** Not how it.

**Speaker A:** Is. And this, okay, it just rolls off. And that's what I can roll off of you too. Okay, so the way to do it then is by associating with those kind of people. Yeah, go associate with monks. Yeah, if it rolls off of them right in front of you, maybe it'll roll off of you too, right in front of them. Or maybe when it's rolled off of them and it doesn't roll off of you, the monk will say Don't worry about it. Yeah, don't.

**Speaker B:** Worry. Be happy. It don't mean a thing.

**Speaker A:** And I, I see how it changes people, right? That's the whole point about personality. Personality is not.

**Speaker B:** Fixed. You have a choice. You can change. And like, people are pretty nice here on that Discord. There's— they're really nice. And usually, you know, when I make friends or when I'm hanging out with somebody, it's who can get the best out of the other, you know? Who's better at this or better at that? Or let me throw an insult here. Are you gonna catch it? Are you gonna defend yourself from from it? Are you going to be a man.

**Speaker A:** And step up to the plate? And a lot of social media is like that. And our groups are different because there's enough nobles to take care of.

**Speaker B:** Those.

**Speaker A:** Who are not going to act nobly. And that's contagious. Yes, it is.

**Speaker B:** That's why I recommend go to the Wat I am going to go to the Wat, Dhammarato. You've convinced me. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go on Saturday. And if they have Sunday, if they have it Sunday, I'll go too. I'll go back to back.

**Speaker A:** And I'll just stand there like, without knowing— Philadelphia, they'll have Sunday, what, 12 hours from now?

**Speaker B:** 10 hours from now. No, no, no, it's about to be Monday.

**Speaker A:** Is it? No, wait, no, yeah, it's Sunday.

**Speaker B:** It's Saturday night for you, just turned Sunday morning. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, you're right, it's Sunday. I don't even got the dates right.

**Speaker A:** You know, I'm so lost in my mind. Yeah, I can go tomorrow. When I was in Thailand, I didn't know what year it was. Didn't know when birthdays happened. Didn't take care of them. No calendars anywhere. No change of season.

**Speaker B:** This shit goes from hot to hot. Maybe it rains. That sounds really nice, not looking at the— not looking at the calendar. How old am.

**Speaker A:** I?

**Speaker B:** I don't fucking know.

**Speaker A:** I don't care. I don't care. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so we've solved several issues today.

**Speaker A:** We have, and thank you very much for those that are not really issues at all.

**Speaker B:** They.

**Speaker A:** Were just, let us say, guilt feelings. Yes. All right, so go join the website.

**Speaker B:** Go look on our, uh, uh, search.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they got the Sangha maps.

**Speaker B:** I saw it. Yeah, we've got huge number of maps. Now I've, I've posted on there and I've made groups. Yeah, that's right, you have. And, uh, no, like, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to get active on that and on the Discord and on the Skype.

**Speaker A:** And trying to, trying to stay right.

**Speaker B:** Connected, stay connected with noble people. That's not fallout, right? Not fallout. Because the moment I stop coming back and I stop staying on this frequency, then, oh, it's not going to be good.

**Speaker A:** It's just not going to be good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Anyways. All right, we'll see you later. Thank you very much. You take care.

**Speaker A:** I know you'll have a good day either way. The day is not the issue. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, centers on a Sangha friend (Speaker B) struggling with guilt and a compulsive desire to help a financially and emotionally dependent ex-partner, who is transgender and has a costly cannabis habit.

Here is a summary of the core teachings and advice given:

**1. The Central Problem: Misplaced Compassion & Guilt**
Speaker B feels responsible for his ex's well-being, having made promises he couldn't keep and spending significant money to support her and her roommates. He is trapped in a cycle of enabling her unsustainable lifestyle while feeling guilty about withdrawing support.

**2. Dhammarato's Core Advice: "Johnny One Note"**
Dhammarato repeatedly returns to his central theme: **if you are unhappy, it's because of your thoughts in this moment.** The actual past event or external person is not causing current suffering; the mind's repetitive, guilty, and worried thoughts are.
*   **Key Reframe:** The ex is "not chasing you down the street right now." The suffering is self-created through memory and projection.
*   **Solution:** Recognize you can choose to be happy *right now*, independent of the unsolvable external situation.

**3. Critique of Psychology & Fixed Labels**
A significant portion of the talk debunks conventional psychology and psychiatric diagnoses (like Speaker B's bipolar diagnosis or his ex's dissociative disorder label).
*   **Personality is Not Fixed:** Dhammarato teaches *anatta* (not-self). You are a "moving target," not a fixed personality defined by a diagnosis. These labels are for insurance billing, not liberation.
*   **Psychology's Flawed Model:** He argues the therapeutic model often creates dependency ("psychologists will chase you down the street saying, 'you're not well yet'") and focuses on "psychological archaeology" (digging up the past) rather than present-moment freedom.

**4. Practical, Tough-Love Guidance**
*   **Stop Enabling:** Any further help is wasted and only enables a destructive lifestyle. The kindest action may be to stop, allowing real consequences to prompt change in the ex.
*   **Let Go of the Savior Complex:** The desire to help is often rooted in a need to fix one's own guilt or feel liked and needed. True help sometimes means not helping.
*   **Change Your Environment:** Dhammarato repeatedly advises Speaker B to physically go to a local Buddhist temple (Wat), connect with the Sangha, and immerse himself in a wholesome environment. This is presented as real-world psychology.

**5. The Path Forward: Dhamma as the Solution**
*   **Associate with the Noble:** Happiness and non-reactivity are contagious. By spending time with calm, noble people (monks and serious practitioners), those qualities can rub off.
*   **Question Societal Conditioning:** The simple idea "I can be happy right now" is framed as a revolutionary, anti-consumerist, and anti-dramatic act.
*   **Focus on Habit Change:** Freedom comes from changing mental habits one thought at a time, not from analyzing the past.

**Conclusion:**
The talk masterfully weaves personal advice with profound Dhamma principles. Dhammarato guides Speaker B from a state of guilt and entanglement toward self-responsibility and present-moment freedom. The solution is not to fix the external problem or analyze diagnoses, but to:
1.  Stop the enabling behavior.
2.  See through the illusion of fixed identity and problems.
3.  Choose happiness in the present.
4.  Seek refuge and community in the Sangha.

The underlying message is that the Dhamma provides a direct path to peace that transcends psychological analysis and worldly problem-solving.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Dhammarato) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate his points. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Johnny One Note"**: Used to describe himself as someone who gives the same simple, repetitive advice: forget the problem and focus on being happy now.
2.  **"She's not chasing you down the street"**: A metaphor to emphasize that the perceived problem (the ex-partner's distress) is not an immediate, physical threat in the present moment. The suffering is self-created through guilt and worry.
3.  **"Moving target"**: Used to describe the self/personality. It illustrates the Buddhist concept of *anatta* (not-self), arguing that you are constantly changing and cannot be fixed or defined by a single label (like a psychiatric diagnosis).
4.  **"You can't step in the same person twice"**: A playful twist on Heraclitus's "You cannot step in the same river twice." It reinforces the "moving target" metaphor, emphasizing constant change.
5.  **"Inkjet printer in a business suit"**: A derogatory metaphor for psychiatrists, suggesting their primary function is just to mechanically prescribe drugs based on a psychologist's input.
6.  **"Psychological archaeology"**: A metaphor mocking traditional therapy that digs into the past to find causes for present issues. He counters it with a joke about an "asshole" who was spanked *because* he was already an asshole, not the other way around.
7.  **"Gravity is our God"**: A metaphor to replace the abstract concept of God with a tangible, omnipresent, powerful, and essential force that is observable in reality.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Family and the Cow**: Told by Speaker B's father. A story about a family clinging to a cow that gives barely enough milk, instead of moving on to better opportunities. It's a parable for enabling behavior—Speaker B is the family, his ex is the cow, and his help is the meager milk that prevents necessary change.
2.  **The Story of Rath**: An anecdote about a Cambodian man misdiagnosed with schizophrenia in the U.S. justice system. Dhammarato helped get him re-diagnosed with PTSD. This story serves as evidence that psychiatric diagnoses are often subjective, culturally insensitive, and unhelpful.
3.  **Dhammarato's Trickery into Monastic Life**: He mentions he was "tricked" into becoming a monk by Achan Po. This brief story models the idea that beneficial change can sometimes come through indirect or surprising means, and that what we think we want (e.g., a psychology degree) may not be what we need.
4.  **Dhammarato's Mother, "The Helper"**: A story about his mother, who was a "world-class helper" who needed to be needed. She favored his sister because his sister remained dependent. This illustrates the potential pathology of a "helper" identity—it can create codependency and prioritize the helper's emotional needs over the actual well-being of the person being "helped."
5.  **The Alcoholic Husband Pattern**: A generalized psychological story about how an enabler (a woman with an alcoholic father) often repeats patterns of relationship until a role reversal occurs. It's used to suggest Speaker B might be unconsciously replicating a family pattern of enabling.

### **Core Function of the Metaphors and Stories:**
They all serve to dismantle fixed views—about problems, the self, psychology, and help—and replace them with a flexible, present-moment, and self-responsible perspective rooted in Dhammarato's interpretation of Buddhist wisdom. They shift the focus from fixing external problems (a diagnosed ex-partner) to changing one's internal relationship to those problems.
