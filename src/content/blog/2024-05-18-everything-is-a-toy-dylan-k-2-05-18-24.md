### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Did that help?

**Speaker B:** Yep, I see you now.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. So what you were saying was, is that you can change your thoughts, but your feelings Correct? Is that what you said?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I find it difficult to change feelings but far simpler to change thinking or thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Well, uh, there's many different examples, and that, that one, it would be very, uh, old-timey Diesel engines had a crank on them, didn't have electric motor, uh, jet, you know, didn't have an electric starter, but it had a very strong spring. And what you had to do was to crank that thing up, tighten that spring, then you'd push a button and that spring would release and it would start the engine. So let me tell you again, okay? Didn't have an electric motor, didn't have an electric starter. What it did have was a crank, but the crank didn't crank over the engine because that would be too much work. But what the crank did was it coiled up a spring, and you crank and you crank and you crank and you crank, and as you're cranking up that spring, it's got enough energy in the spring now so that when they push the button to release the spring, the engine will start from that stored-up energy that they put in with the crank. So they'll crank about a minute and get that spring all tightened up, and now there's enough energy to turn over the engine. Does that make sense to you?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it makes sense.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's another— here's another example. Imagine that, um, there is a bucket and it's got a— uh, it's under a faucet and the faucet is just dripping. And when you first start dripping that bucket of water, first off, it's going to just, um, it's going to evaporate because the bucket's hot. But as it keeps dripping, it's eventually going to cool off, and then the water is going to start building at the bottom of the bucket.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And as you keep putting water in the bucket, drop by drop by drop, it's eventually going to fill up the bucket to the point that it overflows. Is that correct? Correct. Okay. Now what if every few minutes, just as you're getting— beginning to get some water in the bottom of the bucket, you turn the bucket over again? And then you put it back under the faucet and get a few more drops, and then you turn it over again, right? That's what you're doing, is that you're wanting instant results, and then what you have to do is you have to keep turning that crank, keep telling yourself that you're okay, keep telling yourself, and eventually you will start to believe it. And as you believe it, you begin to feel better. Okay, so even though this is a backward example, Hitler in his book wrote Mein Kampf, that if you tell a lie over and over and over again for the first year or so, people are not going to believe the lie. But after year after year after year of the lie, because they've gotten so used to it They start to believe it even though it's still a lie. Okay, this is called propaganda. Most of the people know that the news is just a pile of crap. They're lying to you. The TV announcers have got their own agenda, and those who are listening to Fox News have been lied to now for the past 30 years. And look how many people begin to believe it. Okay, so this is the same way with your practice, that in fact the feelings come later because your feelings are so ingrained that you're in the habit of feeling in such a way that every time that you tell yourself that you're okay, something inside says, no, you're not. And the answer to that is, yes, you are, you're okay. Get a load of the fact that you're okay. Keep looking at it, that the world is okay. This is part of the reason why students need to be in seclusion for this, is because the people around them are going to give them a whole lot of negative feedback. They're going to give them a whole lot of propaganda. So it works the other way around, that if you've been living a lie for your whole life, believing it deeply, That when you start telling yourself the truth, it's going to take slowly for it to come on. Here's another example. When you have a sponge in the kitchen that is wet and moistened every day, 2 times a day, then it'll stay wet and pliable. But if you let that sponge dry out completely, then when you put it back in the water, it's not going to receive the water well. It takes a while. That's also true of cloth, that you hang your clothing out to dry, and when they get very, very dry, then if you can take that cloth and dip it into water, it's not going to take that water very well. Water all products back, or water that's not going to stick to the cloth immediately. But a moist cloth is going to receive water very well, very easily. But a very dry cloth is not. So if you're already in the habit of being very dry, being in this state of feeling then telling yourself okay is not going to get it done the first time. And that happens to almost all the students because they don't believe it. They don't believe they're okay. That's like the sponge not taking the water. So you have to keep putting that sponge in the water. You keep having to tell yourself the truth. You have to practice. Over and over and over again, and pretty soon it'll eventually start to take. Another example of that is that the farmer plants a seed, and then he goes back 10 minutes later, "Where's my tree?" Well, you have to plant and water and water and water and water, and slowly the tree begins to grow. And after a while, you've got a tree, but it's still a sapling. But after a while, then it's going to grow into a big strong tree if it's well protected. And that big tree then will support lots of life. Birds make nests, and beetles will hide in it, and the squirrels will get into that tree, and that tree will support a lot of life. But the seed doesn't. So you have to nurture it. And so don't say, oh, I feel good, and then check your feelings and say, no, I don't, because that next thought of no, I don't feel good, that's now an unwholesome thought. That's like turning the bucket back over. You've only got a few drops of water in, and now you're dumping it back out again. So the correct practice is going to be to keep that bucket, drop by drop, filling it back up. And when you say, oh, I'm feeling a little bit better now, that's a wholesome thought. Yeah, I can feel a little bit more safe, a little bit more secure, a little bit more comfortable. Those are the kind of thoughts that you want to have rather than, I feel good. No, I don't. I feel good. No, I don't. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. No, I don't. And you say, I feel good. I feel good. Yeah, I feel good. But I feel good. Yeah, I feel good. So you're actually contradicting and harming your own practice when you're testing to see if you feel good yet or not. Okay, so consistently.

**Speaker B:** So let's say I'm noticing and feelings come up. Should I not even try to label the feeling and then say, "I feel good," to the feeling? Or should you say something that's slightly more congruent to the the part that is feeling good right now and help to grow that into a bigger blossoming.

**Speaker A:** All right, then expand anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Feels bad. Yes, let's take.

**Speaker A:** This as an example. Okay, people will start to practice and they'll recognize that they've got anxiety. Possibly they didn't even know they had anxiety, and then they start to practice and start to see what's going on. They recognize the anxiety So one of the questions that I would ask was, is this anxiety brand new? Did you just create it, or is this an old habit?

**Speaker B:** It's an old habit.

**Speaker A:** The answer would be an old habit. And so then we can say, all right, can we begin to play with that feeling of anxiety? As we breathe in, can we breathe in and change the anxiety? In other words, as you breathe in, can the anxiety grow? And as you breathe out, the anxiety decreases? As you breathe in, can you move it a little higher in the chest or a little lower in the chest? Because anxiety actually has a major physical component, as do all feelings. In fact, all the negative feelings have a quality of fear, and fear is a bodily chemistry reaction. To what the mind is doing. And we get into the habit of feeling afraid, feeling uncomfortable, feeling tense, uptight. And always that has an element of fear in it. So this is why it's good to get into seclusion, get your body into an empty hut much better, in fact, in an empty hut than in a meditation retreat center, because the meditation retreat center has kneecaps, it's got skirts, it's got whispers, it's got rules, it's got expectations. And when you go into an empty hut, you can get rid of all of that kind of stuff that's going to cause anxiety and fear. So when you're in seclusion The reality is that you're safe. You shut the door, and the reality is that you're safe in that room. Okay, so the feelings of fear, then the feelings of being uptight and tense and whatnot, are actually old memories as opposed to what's happening right here, right now. Because right here, right now, you're actually physically in reality safe. So reflecting upon that, talking to yourself about it, recognizing intellectually that you're actually safe, and keep saying that to yourself, "Hey, I am safe. There is really no reason for me to be uptight, anxious, afraid, full of anxiety, full of tensions, because in reality I'm actually safe right now." And so as we practice this way, then we begin to feel safe and secure, we can feel comfortable, and then is when that brings on the sense of satisfaction. So if you're feeling that sense of Anagami, not being afraid, So you have to actually kind of talk yourself into it, see the reality of it, of the way that it is, nurture yourself. Just like the way that a young child gets freaked out by, say, seeing an animal they've never seen before. Maybe they're imagining an animal that they've never seen before, and if the father says, "You just go back to sleep, there's no bears in your closet," then the child's going to grow up with fear. But if Daddy will take the kid into the bedroom and say, okay, where was the bear? Where was the bear? Not where is the bear. Where was the bear? Oh, he's in the closet. Well, let's go to the closet and see. In reality, there's no bear there. Now let's look under the bed. There's no bear there. And so we check out with the child so that the child can see in reality there is no bear there. And so now the bear, because Daddy is also feeling comfortable and relaxed and maybe even cheerful helping his son— in other words, the father is nurturing his child— so you too can begin to nurture yourself. Aha, there's really nothing to be afraid of. There's really no reason for you to feel tense and uptight. That the bear is actually just an old mental situation. And so by nurturing yourself and in reality being in seclusion, you in fact are working both sides of it so that the reality and the body are on one side, and that the thoughts that you're having is also beginning to change your attitude. And your thoughts and your attitude then are helping with the body to try to kind of corner the feelings into becoming real. They're conditioners, but they're not causation. There's a difference between a conditioner. An example of that is you've got a glass of poison and you put a little water in it, it's still going to be poison. But if you put a lot of water in it, then it's not very poison. Let's say that you take that poison which is a kind of half of a glassful and put it into a great big swimming pool. And now that poison is so diluted that you can drink the swimming pool water safely. Yeah, the poison's still there, all cup, the whole cup of it. All right, so this is what we're going to do, is we're going to have so many wholesome thoughts that the poison is going to become diluted. But if you keep emptying the bucket every time, or keep adding more poison— if you can put the clear water and put more clear water and put more clear water, that's going to eventually get you in a state of feeling good. But if you put water and then more water and say, hey, that's not enough, let's put some poison back in And now you're re-concentrating it in back with poison. So let's make sure that you're not having unwholesome thoughts. Oh, I don't feel better. And come back and just keep repeating, yeah, this is okay. I'm feeling a little better. It's kind of like you have to wind things up. You have to keep putting stuff on. So another way of thinking of it is imagine that all your unwholesome thoughts, in fact all of your past, it's like a bunch of crap, it's a bunch of sewage, and that all of that stuff in the past can be covered over with what's happening right now. So we start adding new things. Now normally what happens is if you flush a new thing down the toilet, it's just going to become part of the sewage. That one hamburger in a, in a, uh, a cesspool is not going to be a hamburger anymore. It's going to be part of the cesspool, right? But let us say that the cesspool is only 10 feet across and you've got a field of hamburgers just a mile across. And now when you go to that cesspool, it's going to be hard to find because it's covered with delicious hamburgers. So what we have to do is kind of dilute it. So this is also the idea with the habits, is that the habits are deeply ingrained, but if you keep going against that habit and start building new habits, then eventually the new habits will take over and the old habits will fade away. So that's probably a more realistic way of saying it, but it's nice to know about all of these metaphors. That if you've got a bad thing, but you've got a whole lot of new good things, then that bad thing is not so much. But if you have a good new thing and then say that's not good enough and add more bad things to it, then you're not going to make very quick progress. You have to keep coming back with more wholesome and more wholesome and more wholesome rather than diluting it with more unwholesome, like, I don't feel good enough yet, this meditation doesn't work, Anapanasati is a bunch of crap, I said I feel good 10 times in a row and I still don't feel good 10 times in a row. And that's the way that many people practice.

**Speaker B:** So should I prioritize saying to myself wholesome thoughts even when thoughts aren't arising? Like, now's an opportunity for me to start reprogramming myself, or should I just be doing the wholesome thoughts when a negative one comes in? So a negative one comes in, I'll say two good ones.

**Speaker A:** That's the way of doing it. We're talking about the way that the Buddha teaches is to have Sati, in other words, to remember, to take a look at, is this thought unwholesome? And if this thought is unwholesome, we're going to change it into a wholesome thought. So here's the sequence of events. Oh, I'm practicing Anapanasati. I'm going to tell myself I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. And then the thought comes, wait a minute, I don't feel so good after all. And then that happens. Now, do we recognize that we still have our Sati so that we can see that and see, aha, I just had an unwholesome thought. Let's change that back into a wholesome thought again. So we practice some more, and then another unwholesome thought will come up. We say, hot dog, I see that. Haha, I'm very happy that I see that. Now, mostly what will happen with beginners is that I see that, oh no, I'm not practicing correctly. Oh, I'll never get anything out of that. Now We've had 4 or 5 negative thoughts because we saw a negative thought. So when we see a negative thought, let's make a change to it immediately. And let's be on guard, or begin to watch, begin to notice, begin to have wise attention. Because if we attend wisely to 'this is Dukkha' and 'this is not Dukkha,' then we're actually practicing the Eightfold Noble Path correctly. We're practicing the Four Noble Truths correctly. But if we say, 'Oh, this is Dukkha. Oh, that's terrible, we shouldn't have any Dukkha. Oh, I broke another rule,' now we're just adding more and more and more Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So sometimes, sometimes when I'm noticing my thoughts, the thoughts don't feel fully formed. Like there's no voice narration in my head saying, reading out the thought like I'm reading it in a book.

**Speaker A:** Well, they're fully formed. They're just not discursive thoughts. There are thoughts that are not all discursive. You did have a thought, but you didn't put words to it. You're saying that it's not fully formed. What that means is it's not fully formed as a discursive thought, but it's still a thought. And can you see those? Can you see those non-discursive thoughts? In fact, a feeling is a non-discursive thought. A feeling is a kind of thought. Another way of talking about it is that a thought is anything that you do in a mind moment. So you can feel your arm, you can feel the breeze, you can feel sad, you can feel "I should not be sad" as a discursive thought, but you had a lot of thoughts in there, that in fact a discursive thought generally takes a whole lot of other little tiny thoughts to put the sentence together.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And then sometimes there's no thoughts but action is happening. For example, I'm speaking right now, and when I watch myself speak, it's like the words are just coming out on their own, and I don't really know how that's happening, but there's no thoughts behind it that I can detect.

**Speaker A:** Right, but can you see whether that thought is that discursive sentence that you said Is that wholesome or not? Right now it's not wholesome. Make a change to it.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, so even behind the words I'm saying, there's discursive intention or feeling behind that that I'm not aware of yet, or now I'm becoming more aware of it, now I'm noticing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you are. That's the practice, the skill development.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So that skill development then would be helping you to be able to see that's an unwholesome thought. Let me change that to a wholesome. That feeling, in fact, is unwholesome. Let me change it to a feeling. This is wholesome. Like, take a deep breath and relax. And I can feel good. I can feel relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Now, when you feel good and you feel relaxed.

**Speaker A:** And then the thoughts come.

**Speaker B:** Back up, Well, part of me, part of me wants to have something else to say or contribute or do, or some continuation. Otherwise, I feel like I'm going to.

**Speaker A:** Get some joy out of— there's nothing to do. Wow, that's the best part, is the job that needed to be done was to come out of the unwholesome thought. So the job that needed to be done has been done. So now there is nothing left to do. But see, you're in such a habit of doing, then when you have done what needed to be done and that you can relax and do nothing, then that thought comes, "Oh, I should be doing something," and you see that thought as an unwholesome thought. You say, "Oh, never mind, I can just relax.".

**Speaker B:** How do you move towards being both really relaxed and still doing things like, you know, going to work and working, or Or— but you've been working and.

**Speaker A:** Working and working for years and years. You know how to do that. Do you know how to relax? Because if you can learn how to relax, then you can work relaxed. I say a way to talk about that would be stop working and start playing. Do not see the work as work. See it as a toy to play with. It's okay to screw up. It's okay to make mistakes. In fact, screwing up and mistakes are two unwholesome words. That if we can think of it instead as a learning experience— oh, I learned something. Oh, that doesn't work, I learned something. That doesn't work, haha. But most people say, oh, it didn't work and I don't know what to do now. Oh, poor me. And now they're back into unwholesome thoughts again. But when you see everything is a game, everything is a toy, nothing really matters, there's nothing important, that what you're doing is fun, it's not a job, then you can become very successful at it because you're learning. You're willing to learn because you're willing to try things. But people who are afraid to make mistakes, they're slow learners, and so they wind up staying in bad feelings a lot. And that's the majority of the people. The majority of the people can't change because they're afraid to change, because they're afraid to screw up. And their screwing up is actually all based upon a set of standards that they have. They made those rules up. They made the rules up, and then they compare themselves against the rules they made up, and they feel bad. So you can also begin to see the standards that you make, the standards that you set. And when you change that, you can change it into, oh, I'm not having to work and do and meet a set of standards. I'm just having fun and enjoying what I'm doing. What's the difference then in this regard between striving and working and becoming number one versus relaxed and being number two? Aren't you satisfied with being number two? Being number two is great! The guy who is number one is the one who is a jerk, he's the one who feels bad, he's the striver. And he's not enjoying— even he's number one, he doesn't enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** What about if you were last in the team? What if you were last? Can you still enjoy being last place? Let's say you're striving because you're the.

**Speaker A:** One who was making the competition, you're the one who was setting the standards and the goals. If you just turn everything around, then the last is now number one. You could be the number one laziest screw-up in town and be enjoying, oh, look at that, I'm number one. It's all a matter of changing your attitude.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So, Arhat, begin to be satisfied the way things are, and you feel good and comfortable about it, rather than setting standards that you're breaking. Remember, you're the one who is in charge of your mind. You're the one who makes up your own rules, and you have the ability to feel the way you want to feel. You have the ability to have the mental attitude that you want to have. You have the ability to have the mental state of mind that you want, but you have to practice because right now you don't have those skills developed. Very well. And so the old habits already generally will just take right over the default position, right? You know about computers, there's always default positions. And many beginners, they just stay with the default positions and they stay slow. But if you begin to change the defaults into something that's more, let us say, beneficial So let's change those defaults. And by the way, the defaults that we have are just old habits that we developed in childhood. We get our default positions from our parents, who they had their default positions. We actually learn our unwholesome behavior from other adults and other people— siblings, teachers, aunts, uncles, grandpas, those kind of people, are not brilliant, joyful, noble people, unless you're very lucky. [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Would you say that unwholesome families. And so we take that default as what we've learned from our folks. But you don't have to be stuck with those defaults. You can change the way you feel. It takes practice.

**Speaker B:** Is focusing on the three characteristics beneficial here as well?

**Speaker A:** Or actually, I wouldn't say spend a lot of time on them other than seeing when they occur. For instance, the three characteristics are Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let's look at that first characteristic. That first characteristic means everything is in— everything is changing, everything is not steady, and it's likely to change just when you're not watching. And in fact, watching, you can watch it change. But normally what happens is something changed while we weren't watching, and then all of a sudden we get surprised. Okay, so now imagine that there's a road that has a fork in it, and when you get down that road and progress towards that Anicca, you get to that fork in the road. Which one are you going to take? You're going to take the Dukkha road, or you're going to take the— oh, it's not mine. So let's say that the laptop breaks. Oh, my laptop broke! Oh, poor me! Oh, dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, Bill! But when we see the laptop breaks, we can say, aha, that's not me that died, it was just the laptop. The laptop's not that important. Laptops are pretty cheap nowadays. I can get another laptop. So when something changes, we can either take the unwholesome or we can take the wholesome. So instead of saying Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta and the three characteristics and get all highfalutin Buddhist and all of that, instead we can say, when things change, I've got a choice. Am I going to take the low road or the high road? When things change, am I going to be able to handle it well, or am I going to fall into the ditch with my face in the mud?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Or another way of saying it, let's say that you're tooling down the road, let us say on a motorcycle. If you're watching where you're going and you see that pothole in front of you, you can avoid it. But if you're on your cell phone or talking to a friend or lollygagging and not watching when that— so when that pothole shows up, you're going to hit right in it. You may even wreck because you hit that pothole. So that's the Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. The road is there, but it changed. Now it's got a pothole in it. Are you going to see that pothole and avoid it, or are you going to step right in it? Those are the three characteristics. You like that, huh? That happens, that happens in the mind too. You're tooling down your own road and all of a sudden you have a pothole. Are you going to see that pothole and avoid it, or are you going to step right in it? The habit is to step right in it. So yeah, we're doing the three characteristics big time. We're watching what the mind is doing, and when the mind changes to something, can we see that so that we don't go down into the path of Dukkha? We take the path of Anatta— not mind, not a problem, no big deal.

**Speaker B:** So for me recently, I realized that, and this goes into the impermanence part, that I can't cling on to anything anymore. Like, I can't cling on to job because job is impermanent. I can't cling on to relationship or friendship because friendship comes and goes. Health comes and goes. Health has come and gone for me many times. And with that left kind of a sense of emptiness, but then also I felt an impression of the mind that was seeking something to reattach to, and that it had lost what it used to try to attach to to be happy. But now there wasn't— there's recognition that there was no way they could cling on to anything. But I feel like it's seen that impermanence, but it hasn't filled the hole in. There's a hole now where it says, 'I can't cling on to anything,' but it hasn't recognized that happiness can be created in the moment, moment to moment, without anything.

**Speaker A:** Here's a phrase for you: freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. So when you've lost that friend, you're free of him. Can you see the positive part of that? You don't have to put up with that dude anymore. He's gone. But if you lose a friend— oh, poor me, I want that friend— now you're taking the Dukkha road rather than the Anatta, Sunyata, emptiness road.

**Speaker B:** What would you say about when you do, I guess, bad actions or things that hurt others? How do you— Well, now wait a minute.

**Speaker A:** Let's not go off into dealing with other people yet. Let's get your own mind straightened out.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because if you've got your own mind straightened out, then you can happily enjoy anything that happens from the outside world. Anytime somebody falls down, you can smile at them and help them up. Yeah, but what happens with most of the time is people slip and fall. In other words, they land in a pothole, they weren't watching where they were going. And what are you going to do? You're going to jump in the pothole with them? That's what most compassion is. It's all, they're unhappy, let me be unhappy, that way we can commiserate with each other. You know, misery loves company. In fact, that's how you learn misery, was because you got company with other people who were miserable. This is why we want to practice alone, getting away from it all, so that we can begin to practice a way, in a way, of becoming happy. So that then you can handle happily whatever happens. There's your three characteristics right there. Whatever happens— Anicca— are you going to let it get the best of you? Are you going to be able to get the best of it? That's your Dukkha. It got the best of you. So when you're around angry people, what are you going to do, get angry? You want to be afraid? Can you be happy and content even though somebody's right in front of you, all angry and fistballed up and yelling and screaming? Are you going to yell and scream back, or can you remain your happiness? That's the training. So let's train in seclusion so that you can train, because in fact you already get uptight and angry yourself. Can you change that into being joyful? You can change that into being joyful, and you've got the habit now. You've got all of that fresh water, you let that bucket fill right up. Now you're not only joyful, but you're full of joy. And so it can overflow. Instead of— you've heard this expression, a teaspoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down. Okay, well, now we're going to use a backhoe shovel full of it. You dump a whole backhoe shovel full of sweetness on somebody, they're bound to get a teaspoon out of The question is, do you have a backhoe shovel full of joy? It is if you keep practicing. No matter what they say, you're still going to be okay. This is how we practice. This is why we practice the way we do, is to get yourself into an okay position that is so habit-formed that you've got a new habit now and it's unshakable. But you have to keep practicing over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** I'm curious about right speech. If we can talk about that.

**Speaker A:** Um, if you don't have any wrong thoughts, you're not going to have any wrong speech, now are you? If you don't want anything, if you're comfortable, then you're not going to lie to somebody about it. If you're okay by yourself and they can't harm you, then you're not going to be gossiping about them.

**Speaker B:** In particular, right speech comes naturally when.

**Speaker A:** Your mind is together. The word for right speech and wrong speech is for idiots who have no control over their minds, so you give them a new rule. When you're free from the rules because your mind is strong, your mind is clear, you don't need those rules. You don't need to follow right speech. What you need to do is be happy. And your speech is going to be just fine.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what are your thoughts on right speech and humor though?

**Speaker A:** Right speech.

**Speaker B:** And humor. Humor, because humor, making jokes— can— yeah.

**Speaker A:** Humor that is beneficial, because some humor is dark, some humor is rotten, some humor makes people feel bad. Some humor makes somebody a butt of a joke, and some humor is uplifting. Some humor is lightning. Some humor is uplifting. And if your mind is already an uplifted mind, then you're naturally— your jokes are going to be positive, even if you're using low-caste language. At least it's funny and Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** So most comedians make jokes either about others or themselves.

**Speaker A:** Most comedians, by the way, feel bad. They use humor as a kind of an insecure medicine to try to cure their unhappiness. Very rarely is a comedian actually a happy guy. Now, happy guys are often comedians, but comedians are almost never by themselves happy. And if they do, it's their humor that makes them happy, so they got to keep telling jokes Otherwise, they're going to feel really bad. And this is part of the way of managing hecklers, that in fact some comedians are very funny until the hecklers start on them, and then they get really angry and uptight. They're no longer funny. I've seen people actually ruin their careers because they were comedians who couldn't handle somebody else's humor. Have you ever heard of The Seinfeld?

**Speaker B:** I've heard of the show, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. So there was one of the actors, uh, who after the show was completed, he went on a tour being a comedian, and somebody heckled him and he got angry. He, he career because he couldn't handle the heckling. And so most comedians, I mean, like Roger Dangerfield, I ain't got no respect. That's because he believes he ain't got no respect. He tries to make a joke out of it. So comedians generally are not very happy people.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So are there any comedians you'd say are happy, or anybody you know of that is a comedian or celebrity that is happy? Or would you say they're all in Dukkha? I'm just curious if there are any examples you're aware of, or— well, I would say, like, examples— I would say.

**Speaker A:** My favorite comedian, my favorite comedian was George Carlin. Have you ever heard of George Carlin?

**Speaker B:** No, I have not. I will look him up.

**Speaker A:** Wow, you need to go look him up because a lot of stuff he said was really funny, but it was also kind of dark. The way that he would send people up, you could tell that it hurt him. He was not a happy dude, but he was funny.

**Speaker B:** Right? Did you find that you're not going.

**Speaker A:** To be a comedian, a professional comedian? They're having too much fun. A professional comedian, by and large, is going to be an ordinary person that is full of their own stuff, and that's what they joke about. They're trying to make light of a bad situation. To a real light of that situation. He can just be making the light situation even lighter.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I see.

**Speaker A:** So all of this comes back to your question about right speed. If your mind is right, your speech is right. When your heart— for and against are forgotten, rather than making jokes about the, uh, what you're against, about what you're against. So set your heart right, set your mind right. And your speech will take care of itself. Or you can have a bunch of rules about how you're supposed to speak because the mind is not right yet. That's why we give precepts. That's why we give rules to children. That's why God gave the Ten Commandments to the Israelis, because the Israelis were Bad actors, you give rules to people who break rules. A happy person, you don't give rules. So the question that you should be asking instead is, can you see those unwholesome thoughts? Can you see them so that you can change them before it becomes an unwholesome speech and an unwholesome joke? Can you see those unwholesome thoughts and say, 'Aha, I see you'? The very art of 'aha, I see you' is already changing it. And so you begin to get really playful, because nothing is serious anymore. Let's not be serious, at least be playful. We can be dedicated to being playful. We can be enthusiastic about being— we can be eager even about being playful. We can become delighted with being playful. The serious is heavy. So if you're serious about changing your feelings, That's why you can't. So become light. Oh, I don't feel good right now. That's okay, it's okay. Keep telling yourself everything is all right, everything is okay, not a problem in the world, and pretty soon you'll begin to feel that way.

**Speaker B:** Awesome.

**Speaker A:** Awesome is correct. That's exactly right. Okay, Dylan, so now you've got a better idea about how to practice. You go practice like this. All right, we'll see.

**Speaker B:** Appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we'll see you next week.

**Speaker B:** All right, yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** Oh good, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** See you then, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student (Speaker B), focuses on a core principle of mental training: **changing feelings by systematically changing thoughts.** Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem & Method**
*   **The Problem:** The student finds it easy to change thoughts but difficult to directly change feelings. Dhammarato explains this is because feelings are deeply ingrained habits from the past, like a dry sponge that doesn't absorb water immediately.
*   **The Method:** You cannot change feelings directly or instantly. Instead, you must repeatedly and patiently plant **wholesome thoughts** (e.g., "I am safe," "I am okay," "This is not a problem") to gradually condition new, positive feelings. This requires consistent practice, not checking for immediate results.

### **Key Analogies & Instructions**
1.  **The Spring Starter / The Dripping Bucket:** You must "crank" or accumulate wholesome thoughts repeatedly (like winding a spring or filling a bucket drop-by-drop) to build up enough "energy" for a change in feeling. Turning the bucket over (checking if you feel good yet and saying "No, I don't") dumps out your progress.
2.  **Propaganda / Dilution:** Just as repeated lies (propaganda) become believed, repeated truth becomes believed. Your negative mental habits are like poison or sewage; you dilute or cover them with an overwhelming volume of wholesome thoughts.
3.  **Nurturing the Self:** Treat yourself like a nurturing parent comforting a scared child. Investigate your anxiety (e.g., "Where is the threat?") and use logic and repetition to see the present-moment safety, thereby nurturing a new feeling of security.
4.  **See Thoughts, Change Thoughts:** The practice is **Sati (mindfulness)**: noticing a thought or feeling, discerning if it's wholesome or unwholesome, and **immediately** replacing an unwholesome one with a wholesome alternative. The moment you see an unwholesome thought, that awareness is the first step in changing it.
5.  **From Work to Play:** Shift your attitude from striving and fear of failure to playful learning. There are no "mistakes," only learning experiences. You can redefine success (e.g., being the "best at being relaxed") because **you make the rules** for your own mind.
6.  **The Three Characteristics as a Fork in the Road:** **Anicca (impermanence)** is the fact that things change. When change happens, you face a choice:
    *   The **Dukkha (suffering) road**: Reacting with "Oh no, poor me!"
    *   The **Anatta (not-self)/Sunyata (emptiness) road**: Responding with "No big deal, this is not me, this is not mine." True freedom is having "nothing left to lose."
7.  **Seclusion is Crucial:** Practicing alone (in an "empty hut") is ideal to escape the "propaganda" and negative feedback of the world, allowing you to establish the new habit of feeling okay without external interference.

### **Answers to Specific Questions**
*   **On Right Speech:** If your mind is truly wholesome and happy, right speech happens naturally. Rules about speech are for when the mind is not yet trained. A happy mind produces uplifting, beneficial humor, not humor that comes from insecurity or puts others down.
*   **On Comedians:** Most professional comedians use humor as medicine for their own unhappiness and are not genuinely happy people. True, light-hearted humor flows from a mind already at ease.
*   **On "Doing Nothing":** After replacing an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one, the job is done. The feeling that you "should be doing something" is another unwholesome thought to be released. Learn to relax in that nothingness.

### **Overall Message**
**Happiness is a skill built through patient, repetitive practice of wholesome thinking.** You are not stuck with your default (often negative) mental habits. By diligently noticing and replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones—without demanding instant emotional results—you slowly recondition your mind. This builds an unshakable foundation of well-being that can handle life's changes with ease and joy. The path is one of **playful, persistent re-programming**, moving from heavy seriousness to light-hearted freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

The talk uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate the central theme: that changing deeply ingrained feelings requires persistent, patient practice in replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones. Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Core Metaphors for Mental Practice:**

1.  **The Spring-Crank Diesel Engine:** Used to explain that effort (cranking) stores energy (in the spring) that is later released to start the engine (change feelings). The point is that the initial mental work doesn't directly change the feeling but builds up a "charge" that will eventually power the change.

2.  **The Dripping Bucket:** Represents the mind being slowly filled with wholesome thoughts (water). The habit of checking for immediate results ("Do I feel good yet?") is compared to **tipping the bucket over** just as water starts to collect, preventing progress. The key is to let it fill **drop by drop** until it overflows (sustained positive feeling).

3.  **The Dry Sponge/Cloth:** Illustrates how a mind habituated to negative states (dry) does not readily absorb positive suggestions (water) at first. It must be repeatedly exposed (kept in the water) to become receptive again.

4.  **Planting a Seed / Growing a Tree:** Emphasizes patience and consistent nurturing. You can't plant a seed (a wholesome thought) and expect a tree (lasting happiness) in 10 minutes. It requires watering (consistent practice) over time.

5.  **Diluting Poison:** Negative mental habits are like a glass of poison. Adding wholesome thoughts is like diluting it with clean water. If you keep adding enough water (wholesome thoughts) to a vast container (the mind), the poison becomes harmless. But if you add more poison (unwholesome thoughts like "this isn't working"), you re-concentrate the toxicity.

6.  **Covering a Cesspool with Hamburgers:** A vivid version of the dilution metaphor. The past/painful habits are a small cesspool. By creating a "mile-wide field" of new, good experiences and thoughts (hamburgers), the old negativity becomes hard to find and loses its influence.

7.  **The Road with a Pothole (for the Three Characteristics):** This metaphor explains **Anicca (impermanence), Dukkha (suffering), and Anatta (not-self)** in practical terms. Life is a road that changes (Anicca—a pothole appears). You have a choice: see the pothole and avoid it (the path of Anatta—"no big deal, not me"), or fail to see it and crash into suffering (the path of Dukkha). Awareness lets you choose the skillful path.

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **Hitler's Propaganda / Fox News:** Used as a **cautionary tale** about how repetition, even of lies, can eventually make people believe them. This is turned around to argue that the same mechanism can work for truth: repeating wholesome thoughts to yourself, despite initial disbelief, will eventually make you believe them.

2.  **The Father and the Bear in the Closet:** A story about **nurturing oneself**. A scared child believes there's a bear in the closet. A good father doesn't just dismiss the fear; he investigates *with* the child, showing **in reality** there is no bear. Similarly, in meditation/seclusion, you can rationally investigate your fears (e.g., "I am physically safe right now") to nurture yourself out of old, habitual anxieties.

3.  **The Struggling Comedian (Seinfeld actor, Rodney Dangerfield):** Used to discuss **Right Speech and humor**. The speaker argues that most professional comedians use humor as medicine for their own unhappiness, making jokes at others' or their own expense. Their humor often comes from a place of insecurity (e.g., "I get no respect"), and they can't handle hecklers because their inner peace isn't genuine. The point is that when the **mind is truly happy and secure**, speech (including humor) naturally becomes uplifting and harmless without needing to follow rigid "right speech" rules.

4.  **George Carlin Anecdote:** Cited as an example of a brilliant but "dark" comedian whose humor revealed his own inner pain, reinforcing the point that comedic skill does not equate to a happy mind.

### **Summary of Metaphorical Themes:**
*   **Persistence & Patience:** Crank/spring, dripping bucket, growing tree.
*   **Overcoming Initial Resistance:** Dry sponge, diluted poison.
*   **Dilution & Replacement:** Poison/water, cesspool/hamburgers.
*   **Awareness & Choice:** Road with a pothole (applied to the Three Characteristics).
*   **Nurturing vs. Force:** Father with child vs. just telling them to go to sleep.

The speaker uses these varied and concrete images to drive home the non-linear, gradual, and effortful process of retraining the mind, while warning against the self-sabotage of expecting immediate results or testing progress too soon.
