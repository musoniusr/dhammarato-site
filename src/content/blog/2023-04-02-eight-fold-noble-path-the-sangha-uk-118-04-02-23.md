### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Does anybody see that it's running? For some reason here it doesn't give any— yeah, it's okay. All right, so this is the Sunday meeting for UK. It's 4 in the afternoon here in Thailand. Uh, Laurent is joining us from here. In fact, uh, Laurent is what about 20 miles. Even with good binoculars, I couldn't see your house, but I know where it is. Um, so, Kat, you were asking about the Great Forty, and you mentioned it in the sense of an old, old talk that was given to Paul. What do you— what did you get out of that? What was your question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like what you said, that it's all in that sutta basically. But I only listened to about 40 minutes of it and you were talking for a good hour. The whole podcast is an hour and 40 minutes, so I was just wondering if you could— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Talk another hour and 40 minutes about it? Sure, why not? Um, yes, we're talking about Sutta number 117. It's called the Great Forty, and basically it's called the Great Forty because it's got kind of a surprising ending to it. Because, you know, Buddhism is a bit mathematical— 3 of this and 5 of those and 7 of these over here— and there's also a lot of multiplications with 18s and 36s and 108s and that kind of stuff. So when you find out that this sutta is a talk on the Eightfold Noble Path, where does the number 40 come from? Where's the 5 division, etc.? And the answer to that actually.

**Speaker C:** Is.

**Speaker A:** That 2 additional things are added. Now, why is multiplied by 4? Maybe somebody can go look that up. Now, I've forgotten why that the 8 plus 2 was multiplied by 4 to get the great 40. It's right there at the end of the sutta. I've forgotten why. Beta, you want to try that one? That's in fact a question. Does anybody have an idea of why the Eightfold Noble Path plus 2 was multiplied by 4 to get the Great Forty? So while you guys are researching that, we'll go ahead and start talking about the fact that this sutta actually speaks about the Eightfold Noble Path from a completely noble perspective, and for that reason is not introduced the way that it is in other suttas. And that mostly the Eightfold Noble Path Well, hello Jerry! Hello everybody!

**Speaker C:** Hi!

**Speaker A:** So, the Eightfold Noble Path is introduced in many places, in many occasions, and in fact there's quite a lot about it in Sutta No. 44, specifically where it's introduced as Sila, Samadhi, Pañña. That the Eightfold Noble Path is broken into the three groups of Sila, Samadhi, Pañña. And yet in this sutta it's introduced and explained as Pañña, Samatha, Sila. So you could say then that the ordinary Eightfold Path would be Sila, Samadhi, Pañña, and I'll explain that. And then the Noble Path is Pañña, Samatha, Sila. Okay, how does that work? Well, it works like this, that when we all start off in Buddhism, we all start off ignorant. And that's especially true with little kids who were born into a a Buddhist society. And that, by the way, we're trying to create a society here. We got to get those kids to behave themselves. We can't just let them go wild and let them figure out what's right and wrong on their own. They'll be mostly dead before that happens. I'll kill one or two of them myself. So we got to give them some rules. And that's why the Sila always starts first on an ordinary level. And we pack up quite a lot of rules in our lifetime until it becomes quite a package. Sila, bhata, paramasa is what the Buddha calls it in the sense of attachments and clingings to all the rules that we have learned. And when we go to ordain at a Buddhist wat, they're going to give us a whole lot more rules to get started with. And so it seems like that the rules wind up always being the structure like the scaffolding that is put up before a building is put up. But once the building is constructed, we don't need the scaffolding anymore. But we got to start someplace. We're going to build a high wall. We got to get up high to get there to get so that we can build it. And so we have to put this scaffolding in place. But also the scaffolding and the way it's structured defines what the building is going to look like. That's an important quality, that you don't put up a scaffolding for a dome and wind up with a skyscraper. It just doesn't happen like that. In that regard, our scaffolding then defines who we are or what our personality is. And that we think then, because the scaffolding kind of doesn't change, then the structure can't change. And so the whole point is, is that we can take the structure of the scaffolding down, to remove the scaffolding, the way that things are supposed to be, so that we can see things more clearly, and then build, kind of haphazardly without plans, because we're doing it wisely, rather than according to a set of structures or plans, that often conflict with gravity and things. So in this regard, there are these two paths: the ordinary path where the child starts. And you can imagine the brand new meditator in this regard, that he walks into the meditation hall for the first time, maybe in a retreat setting, and he sits down squats down, sits in a cross-legged position, closes his eyes, closes his hands, and sits there. Okay, now he is having every opportunity in that moment to have perfect Sila, because he's not hurting anybody at all. He's just sitting there. All right, but the idea about time is, is that, oh, you've got to be perfect little goody-two-shoes for years and years before you're going to get anywhere with the Dharma. You've got to have a whole lot of perfect Sila for a whole lot of time. And the reality is that all we need to do is to clean our hands right now, and then we can clean the mind right now. And so the Sila, Samatha, Pañña then comes, and this point about the Samatha would be then, the Anapanasati of getting into the first Jhana so that we can see clearly enough. For instance, all of this scaffolding, all of these rules that we've got, to be able to see clearly enough that we can develop wisdom about who we are and what we are not. Most specifically, what we're not, because we've got a whole lot of old ideas about who we are and what we are. But that stuff really kind of melts, and it winds up being that we're not quite sure who we are because we recognize that there's always changes. Okay, so here comes real wisdom at that point, and now one gets on the Noble Path. And so the Noble Path then starts with the wisdom. The investigation fact is, is first here is where right view comes first. On the Noble Path, right view comes first. In fact, you can't even be on the Noble Path without already having developed right noble view. So one of the little jokes I tell is the student says, you've already got right view, you called me. If you hadn't called me, I wouldn't be sure, but now that you've called me, dead certain you've already got enough right view, right noble view, to get started. What did I do when I hit— oh, somebody's done something. Where did I do that?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I did it accidentally. Sorry, I thought it was only for my computer.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's put that back. All right, I'm sorry. No, no problem at all. Uh, it's just hard to see people when it's in the tiny little framework. So, um, yes, we were talking about that transition period that goes between the ordinary person through their development into the wisdom, and then that's where the nobility comes in. Now, in another sutta, in fact, it describes this a little bit further. Is Sutta number 2, the Sabbha Asava Sutta, where it talks a whole lot about what is— oh, what was the word— wise attention. What is wise attention? And it's described thoroughly in the sense of unwise attention would be, who am I, what was I, where am I going, how am I going to get there, all of that kind of past and future kind of stuff is unwise attention, and it leads eventually to a thicket of views we call viewpoints, or who we are. And so the Buddha says, well, what is wise attention? And he says that wise attention is the kind of attention such that the unwholesome is abandoned and the wise things are collected together. Etc., like that. And then he defines wise attention as, "This is Dukkha." Well, this is what he means by that, in quotations, "This is Dukkha," is that wise looking, noting, seeing that we're doing with the Eightfold Noble Path. So in fact, the Eightfold Noble Path is what he's talking about here, is being able to see This is the Dukkha. Then he says, this is the cause of Dukkha, which is a little bit more observation. And then this is the end of Dukkha, taking a breath right here, right now. Wow, I saw that. And out it goes. And then this is the path, which is the Eightfold Noble Path. So these two suttas go hand in hand in the sense of this practice. And then it says, when one sees with wise attention, this is suffering, this is the reason why I'm doing it, this is the end of the suffering, and this is the way through that, then one gives rise then to the finish of the personality view. We begin to see through that personality, we begin to see that were not fixed. There is no destiny per se that is guaranteed, that any destiny that anyone has set up for themselves, they can come out of that destiny. Easy example: he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. That old man better let that— set that sword down. If he keeps waving it at the kids, somebody's going to stick him. Okay, we got to stop what we're doing that's unwholesome and start doing the wholesome. So this whole quality then of seeing the end of Dukkha and then glorifying or rapturing in that we have gotten finished with that stuff, and so now we go to the this, the Great Forty. Does anybody have the answer to the question of why was 8 times plus 2 multiplied by 4? Thomas, did you find that?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think so. It seems it adds also right knowledge and right deliverance. And also wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance.

**Speaker A:** Right, those are the plus two, exactly. Right knowledge, right noble knowledge is in fact the knowledge that I'm talking about. What is that? This is suffering, this is the cause of suffering, this is the end of suffering, and this is the path to the end of suffering. All right, that's the right to knowledge. And the right deliverance then is do something about it, make a change, set that stuff down, stop carrying it around as if you cared about it. Okay, so those are the two. But the question is, why was that two— and not why that those two are added, because obviously that's the whole point of the Eightfold Noble Path, is to add these two extra elements to it. My question is, why was it multiplied times 4? It's right there in the Sutra, probably right within the paragraph that you were already quoting.

**Speaker D:** Yes, it says 20 factors in the wholesome side and 20 in the unwholesome, but I only see 10 in each side, so I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, there's a start, okay? Because in fact it is true that if the mind is unwholesome, then we can practice all of the Eightfold Noble Path right through Noble Wisdom and all of that and still not be free from the hindrances. Or we can go ahead and remove the hindrances. So that's times 2. I've got that one. Okay, anybody got another multiplier? Nobody's got it yet. Okay, well, I'll let you guys go looking for it. You call this pop quiz day. So continuing along and going right into the sutta itself, The Buddha says that right view comes first to be able to see the Dukkha. And in that regard, we need Sati, because Sati is the wake-up call to take a look. It's kind of a waking up or being here now. It's sort of like you're reading a book and somebody walks into the room and walks up to you and taps you on the shoulder. And when that tap on the shoulder comes, your whole frame of reference changes. If somebody can get close enough to you to tap you on the shoulder, you're pretty well absorbed in that book, and that's your frame of reference. You're in that world. But when they tap you on the shoulder, you come back to the real world. Has that ever happened to anybody? Gary, has that happened? Uh, Jerry, sorry, has that happened to you? Is it somebody gets you attention and you just refocus your whole existence right then and there? I wouldn't have thought I'd refocus my whole existence, no. Well, the thoughts, I mean, what you're paying attention to before you were in the book and now you're in a chair and somebody's behind you and here you are. So this is almost like in the fact of waking up. Out of sleep, what's the very— here's a question for you: what's the very first thing that you note when you're— when you wake up in the morning? How do you know that you're awake? When you wake up, what, what does that mean? Well, take a look, play with it, figure that out. All right, next time that you wake up, recognize, oh, I just woke up. But here's something that's important, and that is that almost for everybody, waking up is not the same thing as getting up. There's a different level of effort or energy there. So we can say then that meditation or Anapanasati is practiced that way, is that first waking up is to wake up to realize that you're laying in bed now, you're not off into that dream world or nothingness or whatever that you just came out of. Now you're awake, and that often has to do with the awareness of bodily sensations, that you actually come back into the body. Okay, and so one of the first things that we can do in the morning is the first thing is to remember, take a deep breath, come back into the body, and be here and in bed right here, right now. So once we understand what Sati really is, it's that waking up process of coming out of our slumber, which basically means out of our daydreams, out of our thoughts, into reality. And we keep doing that, we keep waking up into reality over and over again. And as we do that, we begin to make changes. We keep waking up and looking, waking up and looking. Okay, that's the time to look. That's the time for that investigation, to wake up and take a look. Was the thought that I was just having a half a second ago worth having or not? Where was I a half a second ago in my own mind? Was I actually sitting in this chair? I was on a subway somewhere. So this is the kind of stuff to start waking up to see Where were we? What kind of thoughts were we having? And by doing that, this actually then puts us in gear to start making some changes. And this is at the point in that sutta where the Buddha says is that right noble effort, and right noble Sati, and right noble viewing, able to see, start running and circling around each other, which means they're also gathering energy from each other and gaining the skills of being able to wake up, look at what's going on, and make a change in the mind. And the change that we're making has two qualities to it. One is we're going to change it into more wholesome, which is right there in the sutta, to make those thoughts, to change those thoughts into wholesome thoughts. And then the next quality is that we're also changing our thought pattern into more reality. Because we just woke up into reality, that we're no longer in that novel or in that book or in that code, that we've come back to reality. And we want to practice doing that over and over again. So one of the ways of doing that, by the way, is when the Buddha introduces Anapanasati to this mix. Now here's something very interesting that a lot of the Mahasi-like teachers say that they teach the Satipatthana, but the Satipatthana has this issue of these hindrances, these unwholesome thoughts. And in that same place, it talks about the thoughts have to be gotten rid of, the unwholesome, and then it starts to talk about the Dharma in the sense that the five aggregates are mentioned, the seven factors of enlightenment, to the Four Noble Truths are there. And so in that regard, it seems like that those teachers who say that they teach the Satipatthana would teach the students to come out of their hindrances and come right into start having thoughts about the Dharma, because that's basically what we're doing, especially with the five aggregates of, oh, this body is not me, If it were, it wouldn't be so fat. I don't have any control over this body. Not only that, it wouldn't be so old, and I have gorgeous locks. But no, the body doesn't belong to me. And so we can then go, well, guess what? The feelings don't belong to me either. Feelings are just feelings. Humans come with all kinds of feelings already built right into our genes. And up pops this feeling, and up pops that feeling, and we've got no control over them until we take control over them. And when we take control of them, then we recognize, yeah, but they're not me. They're just feelings, and they're fun toys to play with. And eventually we get tired of playing with these feeling toys, set them down, and really take a rest. And so, going through the Satipatthana with the Anapanasati Sutta is the way of the practice of the Buddha. That Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has been known to say that Anapanasati was the only meditation practice that the Buddha taught. He got into a lot of trouble with that, but that was way back in, even before before I was born, and literature search time, they did a lot of literature searches when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa came along, because a whole lot of people wanted to prove him wrong, so they couldn't find that one, but he's got it, that's the only actual meditation practice that the Buddha gave, was Anapanasati. And he says that we're doing this for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana, and we're doing the fulfillment of the Satipatthana for the fulfillment of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the Sambhojana, which I think, Kath, we've already discussed, is in fact the fulfillment of the Eightfold Noble Path. You see, we look at the Eightfold Noble Path from the beginner's angle, or from the start. This is what has to be done over and over again. Again. But at the end of the path, these things actually become enlightenment factors. But you've got Sati ready to go. There it is. Anytime you need it, it pops right up. Ain't no bad feelings going to take over here, boys. We're ready for them, you know. And if bad feelings come up, I'll catch you. I'll see you. All right. And so, uh, unremitting mindfulness, unremitting investigation, unremitting energy, which actually is the effort. When it becomes unremitting, it's no longer an effort. Now we've transformed it from, uh, oh gosh, look how hard this is to do, into look at me, Pop, look what I can do. And what is that? It's an attitude change. So as we change our attitude, that unremitting effort becomes actually an energy. We're glad to do it, we're happy to do it, we're eager for the Dharma, enthusiastic for the Dharma. That enthusiasm and eagerness then winds up being unremitting energy. It's just there, there it is, you're ready to go. It's almost like a jack-in-the-box, you know, that guy that you put into the coil and turn the crank and sing a little song, and then when it gets to the right place, out pops Jack, right? You know, it's got a monkey in there and you turn the crank and out pops Jack. Okay, so this is what we're talking about. It's almost like that we built up our effort to the point that we're almost spring-loaded for the Dharma. That's an interesting one, okay? We're spring-loaded for the Dharma and we're ready to go, okay? And that, backing up with that, is also the unremitting joy, the Piti, Sukkha, And also, the quietness, the relaxation, that eventually melts then into Upekkha, which means you can handle anything. And with that then, the unification of mind. So that unification of mind point is where the Eightfold Noble Path and the Seven Factors of Enlightenment conjoined completely, because that's the object of the Eightfold Noble Path, is to have the mind in a state of unification where we're not arguing with ourselves, we're not doubtful, we're not telling lies, we don't want anything. No doubts, no worries, no flurries, everything is cool. That's kind of state of mind, is the unification of the mind. And this is what we practice then, the right Sati, then right investigation, looking, and then the right effort, combined with the next one which is Samma Sanghappa, which is actually the change of our attitude, from being a loser, or being a victim, or being in a state of confusion, or hard work, or hindrances of any kind. You see, the only kind of way that a human hindrance can apply is to a victim. Hindrances don't apply to a champion, he throws them off. And so this knowledge and deliverance that is at the end of the sutta is also this quality of that it's really easy to throw the hindrances out, we've gotten pretty used to doing that. And so they're no longer an issue, no longer a problem. And so, we work then, with these four things: Sati, Right View, Right Effort, and Right Attitude, over and over again, and that develops in this right, noble unification of mind, the Samatha mind, where everything is together. The attitude that you've got it. Okay, so in fact, the Samma Arya Samatha is now an attitude. The Buddha was known as a lion, you know. This is the lion's roar. You've got it. You're the king of your own life here. As you've probably heard me say, that everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. So where are you going to be in relationship? Are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? You're going to be climbing your way out of your pile of dirt, or you're going to sit on top of your own pile of dirt? That's sitting on top of your own world. That's what we mean by Lokottara, or the supramundane Dhamma, that which frees us from our own crap so we get on top of it. And so this is the Eightfold Noble Path. That's what that sutta is then all about, is getting the mind into that state of Samadhi mind. Now, when the mind is in fact noble, then we don't want anything. And if we don't want anything, then we're really, really unlikely to go to town and kill somebody to get it. Not if we don't want it. All right, so here's where we wind up or finish up with Sila. You see, in the beginning when we were talking, we started with Sila—Sila, Samadhi, Pañña—at the ordinary level. And when Pañña is developed, then we go through this process of the noble method, which is in fact this Sutra number 117. Where the path is completely changed around. And it's changed around starting with the nobility that we got off of the ordinary path so that we can now apply Samadhi directly to where it now actually congeals, leaving us with a natural Sila. We don't hurt anybody because we don't want to hurt anybody. We don't hurt it, we don't take anything because we don't want anything. So your speech becomes pure because you don't want to harm anybody with your dirty mouth, your gossip. And we don't lie to anybody because we got nothing to hide because we're already living pretty good. So this is the way of then looking at the Sila winds up not as a rule for children, which is where it starts out. But we come out of that mentality about the rules and take on a new mentality about the rules. This is also part of the freedom. The freedom is being free from all of the rules that defined who you were before, so that now you can apply the only rule we need. And the only rule we need now is.

**Speaker C:** To cut to Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** This is the only rule. Let's stay out of the Dukkha right here, right now. Whatever Dukkha is coming, let's sidestep it, move out of the way, get out of it right now. If some splashes on, wipe it off, let it go. And let it— and this is the way that we practice. And eventually, this is the state that we're in. So if we keep practicing this right effort of gladdening the mind, then the fruition of that effort becomes energy. The same is true with the Sati, that the Sati we keep putting in Sati, and then the actual Sati at the end is unremitting, that you keep coming back, you don't get lost but in the space between your ears. Keep coming back and coming back and coming back because that's what we've been practicing. And then we look, we can see that in fact this is what's clairvoyance. The student just asked me the other day, or actually I think it was today, about, well, what is that third eye? They were talking about it on Discord. Do you anybody, anybody remember seeing anything about the third eye? Did anybody get any thing from that. All right, so what is the third eye? Well, the third eye and the opening of the third eye is a metaphor for clear seeing, unremitting. You just keep looking, you just keep looking. That's in fact what the quality is, is that we don't come to conclusions. When we come to conclusions, we'll come back into rules. That conclusion will become a new law, a new rule, a new supposed to be. And once we get the rule fixed, we don't have to look anymore. Well, here we're taking a whole different approach. Oh no, we're going to forget whatever it looked like this time and look for it again. Let's see if it's going to change. And in fact, it took them many, many centuries to do enough mapping of the geometry of the motion of the planets before they could come up with any solid formulas. And even then, they needed to fix them, right? We keep looking and keep investigating, and now that they've got the James Webb Telescope up, it's finding things, it's beginning to say, wait a minute, we got to go do this over again, because by our predictions you should not have galaxies that good that far away. So that's basically what they're talking about. Yes, Jesus, go ahead. Oh no, Pedro, that's all right. Pedro, you've got your hand up.

**Speaker E:** Yes, I was thinking that just on the sentence you said about the fact to keep looking, that we never arrive, you know. I noticed the tendency in my mind that, you know, Every, everything that I see, I think, or every sensation, it comes the little voice that, oh, it must be this, must be that. Like there is a critic ready for really everything that happens. It's actually funny to look at this thing, you know, because.

**Speaker A:** When I get.

**Speaker E:** The habit to throw out everything, these little things is like, you know, like a pinpoint, that pinpoints Everything, you know, oh, happens these things, it must be this for this reason. You know, there's always this kind of voice ready to critique everything that happens in my mind or that I see, hear, smell, touch, or feel. It's really funny to look at this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a lot of fun to start watching all of this is happening there. You reminded me, I've forgotten his name, but there's an old Mahayana teacher that's got the book that where it talks about that every moment is like sea foam. They keep— the bubbles keep popping, and then more sea foam comes, and then the little bubbles keep popping. That's actually the reality of the situation, is this moment arises and passes away and arises and passes away. Everything is new. Kimasitu, good to see you. My friend, glad you joined. So today we have been talking about Sutta number 117 in the Majjhima Nikaya, and as a review, I made the point that this sutta is about all we actually need for the entire teachings of the Buddha, and that a lot of the Buddhism is ordinary in the sense that it starts with Sila, Samatha, Pañña, and then when the mind becomes noble, it goes Samatha— excuse me, Pañña, which is wisdom. That's where we start. What is that starting place of the Pañña? That's right Noble viewing, looking, looking, don't come to conclusions. That in fact ordinary view is that. You could go so far as to say that ordinary views are nouns, they're viewpoints, they're ways of looking at the world, almost like a snapshot. This is my world worldview. You know, I've got a photo of my worldview. You want to take a look? It's got everything I believe wrapped right up in that photo. All right. And, um, it's basically divided into two kinds. One is the worldview, or the noble view, of is that, oh, I'm a pretty smart guy and I can get away with it. It doesn't matter what the laws are, I can sneak around and, and get away with And then ordinary right view is a structural system. You could call it complete conservatism in the sense of, oh no, you can't. We're going to have rebirth, we're going to have guards, we're going to have police, we're going to have rules, we're going to have a priest, we're going to have a whole great big structure here just to prove to you that you can't get away with it. And every 4-year-old child knows they can get away with it. Every 4-year-old, every one of us, we're a little liar. We can get away with anything until we don't. And that's the problem, is that we can get away with it for a while, but we don't ultimately get away with it. In fact, the more we keep doing the same thing, the more likely we're going to get caught. You might be able to do one thing one time and get away with it for the rest of your life. You do it twice and you're in danger. You do it 3 times, you'll get caught. So if you want to murder somebody, plan carefully. You got a one-time shot at it. So that's the whole idea of wrong view, is that I can get away with it. I can go hurt people and that's okay. And the Buddha says, no, no, Kamma actually exists. There are right actions that give good results, and there are wrong actions that give wrong results. And guess what? That's right there in the mind. Let's start making that change right here in the mind. We don't need all of those rules that the rule makers can come up with to make sure you can't get away with it. You just kind of accept, "No, I can't get away with it." Let's go find something better to do rather than trying to get away with it. And so this is when the noble investigation starts. And that noble investigation means that we're not interested in how does it fit into the rules, how does it fit into the structures. It means that we're checking about how does this fit into reality right here right now, and we begin to see that our worldviews were wrong. We were lied to. Some of us get downright ticked off at it. I mean, atheists are generally unhappy and upset people because they're angry for 20 years they were lied to. There's a story about that, in fact, it's called You've heard that, 'Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.' You've heard that, right? I'm sure Gary's heard that. Okay, but there's another line to it, and that is, 'Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, but first it's going to really piss you off.' Now, why is that? Is because the truth doesn't match what we thought it should be. It goes against our own rules. And the answer is, let the rules fall away, because the rules of what we've been doing our whole lives to try to make ourselves happy, and they haven't worked yet. Let's go find a better set of rules, like something that actually conforms to reality. And so that's when we begin to choose the truth over our delusional systems. But most people don't. We would rather keep our delusions. Once somebody votes for a certain party, they want to continue to vote for that certain same party, because if they change their vote next time, that proves to them inside their own mind they were wrong the first time. And people don't like to be wrong, so they don't change their vote, even though deep in their heart they know that this is a really stupid candidate, I should not be voting for him, but I did last time. And so I got to do it this time. That's some kind of rules that people have. So, in this process of using the Eightfold Noble Path, we work at the thought level rather than at the action level. That by the time that we're ready for action, it's too late. That we need to really look at what we're thinking so that we can change it at the thought level. That in fact, you can think of it like this: that thinking and feeling lead to speech, speech then leads to action, action then leads to habits, and habits lead to destiny. And the only way that we can change our destiny is by changing our thoughts and our feelings. And so that's where the Buddhist practice is, is change our thoughts and our feelings And we do it when we see what a mess they are right now. So there is where we practice with that Pañña, Samadhi, Sila. Breaking it down into that order then brings about that wisdom, or the knowledge, that brings on deliverance. The Buddha has actually got several suttas where knowledge and deliverance are a pair, that in fact that's one of the things that makes the Anapanasati Sutra number 118 a companion of Sutra number 117, is the fact that they both end in that comparison about knowledge and deliverance. And so we can actually now, now that we're ready for it, we can take an English language word that really doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about at all, but sometimes seems to be stuck on, almost bolted on. The word enlightenment. Have you ever heard of the word enlightenment? Does anybody know what it means? Dad, can you give me a one-liner definition of enlightenment?

**Speaker B:** Uh, drop the load, I guess. Maybe lighten the load.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now, all right, I'll give you 50 out of 100 points on that one, with a happy smiling big fat F. Anybody else got an answer? Okay, the answer is in fact both. You said one without the other. Okay, so you have light at the end of the tunnel, you have daylight, the dawn, you have spread some light on it. In other words, the knowledge part is light. You start looking, you see, you need some light to do that. So enlightenment means let's put some light on the subject, let's look, let's gain that knowledge. And then the other definition of light is not heavy. Lighten up, set it down. And so the word enlightenment in fact can be used in the frame of reference of both of those things, but it requires both. But most of the people all over the world have been practicing from various religions and whatever like that, only the deliverance part and not looking for the knowledge. This is what Christianity is all about. Oh, don't bother to figure out what's going on, just go kiss Jesus's ring and he'll deliver you. They're trying to make an easy way out, but the hard work is figuring out how to break out of your own prison. Breaking out of the prison is actually fairly easy work, one shovel full of dirt at a time. But finding a way out of the prison, or finding out what you need to do to dig your way out of the prison, getting the shovels and all of that kind of stuff, that's the most work. And so we have both of these qualities, that knowledge and deliverance is what we get. And look at how much deliverance we got. For one thing, we're already delivered from wanting stuff that we don't have. Before, that was quite painful. How many of you have ever wanted something that you never got? Yeah. In fact, we spend quite a lot of time wanting things that we don't have in that moment, and we might eventually get it, then it becomes valuable, and now we've got to take care of it, and then we actually shed a tear and cry when we lose it. But it feels really good to not want anything. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it, by the way, in his book on Happiness and Hunger. Where he says that there's two kinds of happiness. The kind of happiness is the fulfillment of your hunger. You want something, you get it, and then you feel better because you got it, at least for a little while. But the real happiness is being free from the hunger. That I don't want anything. I didn't need to get fulfilled, to get satisfied. I'm already satisfied. And so this is what we begin to practice, is being already satisfied. That's what we mean by having a wholesome thought. A wholesome thought is actually a satisfying, satisfactory thought. An unwholesome thought is when we find something wrong with it that needs to be fixed. And so all we have to do is just look on the bright side. In fact, where is the bright side? That where the light is. You shine the light on it. So that's enlightenment, is when we're taking a look, and then we can drop the load, which makes us light in another way. So did anybody ever find out the second way so that it multiplies by 4? Nobody did. Oh, Thomas.

**Speaker D:** I'm not sure I understood it, but if I understood it, I think it is because, for example, it says that right knowledge causes the absence of wrong knowledge. So that will be the multiplication by 2. And also, I suppose wrong knowledge implies the absence of right knowledge. So that's the— I think that's what I've understood, but it may be wrong.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. The distinctions, as far as I remember, are too subtle to actually figure out and remember, and I think that it has to do with the problem of translations. But I was wondering if anybody could, in fact, come right out and give me the the straight answer. Nobody has been able to do that.

**Speaker D:** Now to me it seems that because it mentions 10 factors and 10 are positive, 10 are wholesome, 10 are unwholesome, and then it also talks, it only talks about the wholesome ones, but it mentions that with every wholesome one there is also the absence of the unwholesome one. And I suppose that implies too that for every unwholesome one there is the absence of the wholesome So maybe you can get 40 that way, but I wouldn't bet on that.

**Speaker A:** I will accept that. And the reason that I would accept that then is because this is one of the secret teachings of the Buddha about start looking for what's not there. This is a quality that we begin— I mean, we spend so much time with observing and looking and discerning, etc., like that. But there's another quiet side to it, and that's the Sunyata, the emptiness. Start looking at what's not there. And a way to do that is start looking for the fear that you don't have anymore. Start looking for the anger that you begin to mollify. Start looking at the changes that you've been making. Start looking for the new absences. Start recognizing that what used to be there is not there now. And in that quality of being able to experience that kind of emptiness, ultimately, it's just when there's not anything happening. Isn't that nice? Except that isn't that nice is way too noisy. It's even not that, that everything just comes down to there's not much of anything there at all. And that gives rise to that joke that I like to say when somebody comes up with something really interesting. I'll say, yeah, but you ain't seen nothing yet. Haven't seen that emptiness, haven't seen that the fact that whatever we want to look for is not there. We can start naming off not there and empty the place out completely. So coming to that state of empty mind, and then he just experiences nothing happening. Nothing. Yeah, Tom?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was thinking that Because I always think about the Dukkha, the sense of dissatisfaction of wanting something you don't have. But there's also the other side, the side of absence, of the fear of not having that. Yeah, I think it's— well, I suppose it's obvious, but I just thought about that. I think sometimes that in my case, the fear of— well, yeah, emptiness, that at first to part of me sounds scary. Oh, emptiness, nothing happening. What I'm going to do if nothing happens? That sounds terrible. And yeah, I think that's like the other, the B-side of Dukkha, it's both. I was just thinking about that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, to let everything be empty. Pedro, you got your hand up. No, okay.

**Speaker E:** It was a mistake, sorry. But anyway, anyway, I very appreciate this point about the empty side of things, because it's really a new kind of sensation, a new kind of experience when, in fact, when you are emptying the thing, you usually look at what remains in your life. And looking at the space you created, it's really a— whole different experience, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's, that's quite amazing. It begins to happen when you begin to go around and recognize that, hey, what used to be here is not here anymore. There's an emptiness to that, to it now, a spaciousness. Things begin to open up, a freedom, a new— it's almost like that we've been living our lives in a crowded room And all of a sudden, the room is not nearly as crowded as it used to be, and I don't bump into things the way that I used to. A whole lot of stuff is missing here, except for one thing, and that is that room is inside of our own mind. And so the emptiness is coming from within, that we're beginning to empty stuff out, a lot of the past. And we can say it like this: this is something that we can clean up for a lot of people about the past, that when we talk about the past, we can think of it as completely event-oriented, or we can think of it as emotionally laden event-oriented. And an example of that Everybody here, I assume, drives a car. Okay, you don't drive a car, you'll have to imagine. Maybe you've ridden a bicycle. Okay, so we can use a bicycle. In fact, I guess everybody here has ridden a bicycle. Have you ever ridden a bicycle and had any kind of an accident? You fell over, You ran into something, you burst a tire over a curb, something like that. Do you remember having that kind of event happen? Okay. But that was a small, small part of the amount of riding that you did, and yet you've forgotten most of the bicycle riding, but you do remember the accidents. Why is this? Well, it's the way that the mind is geared. It's built that way. We wind up remembering a whole lot of the stuff in the past with an emotional burden. And the way that you can answer that is, is that a lot of the pleasant stuff that happened was not worth remembering, but the dangerous stuff that happened, that was worth remembering. It might save my life next time. Okay, so then we begin to create a whole lot of false positives. We have a whole lot more mental accidents than we actually need to have. We create those things because that's the way that the mind works. We would rather remember an accident than remember the easy part. Another example: little Johnny is writing on the wall with his crayons and Mom comes into the room. If she comes in and says, "Oh, that's beautiful art, Johnny, let's get you an art set." But no, she'll come in and says, "Oh, the landlord, oh, the wall, the painting, and all of that, you shouldn't do that." And now little Johnny is going to remember that, and he won't even remember the beautiful paint job that he put up with the crayons. No, he's going to remember mom giving him a hard time about doing it. So this is the way the mind works, and we remember the crap because we have that delusion that remembering the crap is going to help me someday. And it winds up being such a burden to carry around. All the little things that could help you, but don't, but we keep remembering them. So, when we can get the state of mind where we're empty, we can throw all of that, let us say, self-preservation mechanism stuff out. We don't need it. We made it, we're here alive, we're not in danger right now. So let's not have those kind of memories. And we can begin to relish on the fact that not much is happening, that we can get into the emptiness. But we do that also through the sensory input. In other words, just laying in bed and experience the body in bed, and that's all there is, just the breathing in and out and the laying here. And in the dark, and nothing is happening, and everything is okay. What an empty, empty, beautiful moment. And so this is the way that we begin to practice, is begin to find that empty space where there's nothing going on, nothing at all. But we can't get there until we learn to control the mind to make it wholesome, because we can only get into that state through the wholesome. We can't get through that door by having a bunch of unwholesome thoughts. It automatically just stops. No, we've got to go through the wholesome. And so we've been dancing around that Sutra number 117 today. Actually, we've covered all the most important points Does anybody have any questions? Pedro, you got your hand up. Oh, there's a symbol. Okay, Arahant, you found it. Cat, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't really know. That was great to talk about though, yeah. I think that was great to talk about again. I feel like I need to listen many, many, many, many times the same thing. For me to retain it a little bit and understand it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's true. And in fact, that's what Socrates calls learning. There's one of his episodes where he gets into it with this guy and comes to the conclusion that learning is not gathering in data. Learning is when you piled it up so much that you can throw it back out. That's what learning is, is when you've got it on the inside. And we need to do that. We need to keep hearing it over and over again. I've heard this stuff over and over and over again, read the same sutras over and over and over again, keep getting new stuff out of them. That the Dharma, the Buddha Dharma, is easy. There's just nothing much to it. The entire teaching can be done on one page. In fact, you can get it down to one sentence. I can get it down to two words, get it down to four words: don't worry, be happy. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's all there is to it. But we need to hear about it over and over and over and over again because it's so alien to the way that we were raised. Here's an example of that: a mud pot that has been used to crush, let us say, very hot chili peppers, maybe mixed with garlic. And after you crush those chili peppers in there, you can't just reuse that clay bowl, you know, a pistol and mortar. You can't just reuse it even though you clean all of those chilies out. There's still a lot of chilies in there. I know, I've been to Thailand. And they can clean and wipe and clean and take all of those chilies out and there's nothing left and wash it again and put soap in it. And then they make you something sometime in there and it is so hot and spicy that you can't eat it. And that's because there was still that stuff that was still left inside the bowl even though we've cleaned it. And so that's a good example of we have to keep cleaning. The taste of those chilies are going to be there even though you've cleaned out the mind. It's still in there. But eventually we can clean it out enough. And so this is the repetition. We need to hear the Dharma over and over and over again. We become actually thirsty to hear it over and over and over again. This is actually part of the path, is to get thirsty for hearing the Dharma. So that everybody likes to hear the Dharma. Yes, Vedana, go ahead. Yes, Arahant, you got your hand up too.

**Speaker F:** Um, yes, I wanted to say, uh, it's It's funny how sometimes, even though you know that clinging is going to lead to Dukkha, sometimes when I feel fear about the future or something like that, I will get into planning, trying to figure out a way of how to make this thing stay or whatever. And yeah, there is also some kind of experimentation, right? Because I know it's going to lead to Dukkha, but I have to get burned, I feel like, enough times so that will stop the habit from forming too, in a way.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right. We have to keep looking, taking that time to look over and over again. And also with a widening view of beginning to see not just the things that are in the foreground of our understanding, but also the things that are standing around also. In other words, we begin to look at the emptiness too. We begin to see what's there and what's not there. Then in fact, often we wind up recognizing that there's a whole lot of stuff I thought was there that's just not there, never was there. I had painted it into the picture with my own rule systems. And it wasn't there at all. And so that's a good kind of way of understanding Vipassana, is not just looking and finding things that you didn't know was there, is that we can look and find out that things are not there that we thought were. And so this is why we want to keep investigating, keep looking, Eventually we'll find out that that hero had clay feet. Is another way of saying it, because we now we're inspecting it.

**Speaker C:** Can you guys hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** Can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker C:** Ah, okay. Technical difficulties. I saw you displaying today your.

**Speaker F:** Masterpiece.

**Speaker C:** Of, if I understand correctly, the 9 qualities of a Buddha, Sugato.

**Speaker A:** Oh, last week?

**Speaker C:** Last week?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we know, I don't think that's been published yet, so I don't think that, right. You're listening to it. Maybe you saw it on YouTube, not on YouTube, you saw it on Skype.

**Speaker C:** No, I'm referring to what you presented today. It was a very good example for the quality in a Buddha to explain in one tense, and also in several talks.

**Speaker A:** And always— and also in what kind of talk?

**Speaker C:** In several, several talks.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm not quite sure. Can anybody repeat what he said so that I can.

**Speaker C:** Is it— is the.

**Speaker A:** Problem technical, or— No, he said I do not understand your, um, don't understand you. I don't understand the words you're using. My hearing problem. Please repeat. He's left and come back.

**Speaker C:** In the Ittipi��o, it talks about the 9 qualities of a Buddha, right?

**Speaker A:** 10.

**Speaker C:** 10, 10. And Sukkha is one. I don't remember exactly if it is what I mean right now, so maybe you can say.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I remember that one of them is one of the Pali words. What does— what's the definition of that one? Is that the one with clear vision?

**Speaker C:** No, I think it's, uh, uh, speaking in the right way at the right time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes. All right, there's in fact several places that that's mentioned.

**Speaker C:** And you displayed today, because in the Ittipiso, it's not only speaking at the right time at the right place, it's also the way you, if you're able to formulate it short or long, and you did both today. So I found that to be a good example of that.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad you noticed that. A lot of what we're talking about, folks, comes out of Sutta 139 in the Majjhima Nikaya, about how to teach the Dharma. It has to be done in a way where the students can follow it, basically. As opposed to just, you know, highfalutin, you just say what you want to say and whether people get it or not is not important. You know, that's— and one of the ways of that is to use the local language, to use examples that people understand. That kind of stuff is important for the quality of teaching. Then in fact, you can recognize you're not going to get much out of listening to monks chant the Pali. You're not going to get anything out of that. But the monks will, if they know the Pali.

**Speaker C:** Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. Some people, especially in the monastic system, use different ways of Sugato for a specific purpose that's not always in line with the precepts.

**Speaker A:** So, well, we're all students, you know. There's sometimes— we'll figure it out, we'll get it right.

**Speaker C:** We keep— there's sometimes a place and a time for that, of course. And there are also let's say things, if you just keep watching situations can get out of hand. Maybe this is more, maybe this is more an application kind of question, not so much in the sense of practicing in the moment. And also it is because everything is basically practicing in the moment.

**Speaker A:** I was about to say that and you got it right. Exactly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I just try to formulate that in a way that it transports actually what I'm actually thinking and not what I don't want to say. So that's quite a translatory issue. If nothing works, if nothing is, if nothing gets a wholesome response out of someone, then they basically are left to their Dukkha best?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's their choice. And if you accept their choices, that's their choice, and you can keep your Sukkha. But if you really want them to, you know, to grin up or to, uh, to grin up, and they don't do it, um, then in fact it reminds me of a story. It, it, um, Uncle Remus was very famous in the, uh, oh, you know about that with this movie The Song of the South and that kind of stuff. Okay, so there's Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear. And Brer Fox and, uh, Brer Bear, they decide that they run across a great big patch of black tar, you know, the kind of stuff that they make roads with. And they got the idea, we're going to make a tar baby. This became really racist. This is why this whole story was, you know, banned in the US. But they took this tar baby and set it to the side of the road, and Br'er Rabbit come walking by and he says, hi, y'all. And the baby, the The tar baby didn't say anything. And so Brer Rabbit says, "How's y'all?" And the tar baby didn't say anything. And so he gets really angry and he goes up and he hits it. And when he hits it, he gets his fist stuck in. And so he hits him again and gets his other fist. And so he kicks him and gets that stuck. And now he's rolling around with all four paws. Stuck in this ball, and that's when fox and bear come up. So that's the whole story, is don't go sticking your Dhamma into people. You'll get stuck there. If they don't want it, let them go. You don't have to cheer them up, but you can keep your own cheer. But in fact, you saw that story that the Arahant, he lost his cheer. He had to go.

**Speaker C:** If you stick with your cheer, even that is too much for certain people. So even that becomes a tar baby. So yeah, yeah, I already are already figured that one out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, remember that you've got to have enough sugar. You've heard that story of spoonful of sugar will help the medicine go down. Yeah, not when the guy's fighting with you. It may take a whole quart or maybe a gallon of sugar to get a teaspoon of it down his hatch. And we can see that with the people that we're with. Sometimes we have to be for quite a long time before they begin to see any of it.

**Speaker C:** That's the downside of things. I mean, I don't, you know, the thing for me is I really have no bad intention there, but it's difficult to speak about those things if I don't know if this is actually causing more trouble or not. So I just say it now. This is probably the thing I see in Ajahn Chah's way of teaching is the biggest problem, encouraging people with huge amounts of just sugaring and sugaring and sugaring. And they don't get it. They don't get the Pañña that is needed to understand what he is actually doing. And so they get it the wrong way. And yeah, start to find Anamok, basically.

**Speaker A:** So it has to be delivered with a whole lot of good cheer, a whole lot of sugar. Why? Because People got a whole lot of lemon. And if we're going to make lemon juice, we need a whole lot of sugar.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, what I mean is some people don't respond to that. And as I see, that's exactly right.

**Speaker A:** Not today. So you give them a little bit of sugar and tomorrow a little bit more, and you're always happy. You never buy into their crap. You always are okay, and it doesn't matter whether they change or not. What's mattering is that you can handle that they're not changing. So this is part of the emptiness, is beginning to see the emptiness in your efforts to get them to cheer up.

**Speaker C:** So the way the teaching is conducted is basically correct. It's just It's just not basically in any way engaging with Dukkha stuff in any way. Because for me, even the slightest, even.

**Speaker F:** Pre-Thought.

**Speaker C:** It'S already Dukkha. If I experience those kind of situations, and there is just no— there is just no.

**Speaker A:** Room.

**Speaker C:** Uh, it doesn't make sense to engage with it in any way if it doesn't have any—.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yes, that's the right effort, is to leave that hot rock there. Don't pick it up. Don't engage. Keep your distance, keep your smile, give them joy, sprinkle them with sugar. But if they're hot, they're going to be hot. Let them be hot. That's their— as you know, the Buddha talks about that in another sutta. When somebody angry comes to the Buddha and gets all rageful and everything like that, and when they were finished, the Buddha says, suppose you gave a great big party and invited all of the guests and the people came but they wouldn't eat your food and they left. Who owns that food that you prepared that wasn't eaten? And he says, well, I would. And he says, well, you have delivered me a delicious meal of your anger, and I'm choosing not to eat any of it, so I guess it belongs to you.

**Speaker C:** I really like to investigate more of the possibilities. Use anecdotes and little stories or even just a little verbal nudge or something like this too. It's pretty helpful.

**Speaker A:** Have at it. That's a good one. You can actually change the circumstances, take the Buddha out of it and have an old man sitting in a tree or something. I don't care. But it's correct that whoever is angry, if you don't buy into it, then it belongs to them. There's other things the Buddha says about anger, and one of them is, he said, imagine getting your worst enemy really, really angry because you want him to be angry. Because when someone is angry, they're ugly, they're sweaty. When someone is angry, they can't think straight. When someone is angry and roaring, nobody wants to be around them. Okay, so think about that kind of anger. And now recognize, do you, when you're angry, do you want to be seen as ugly? As can't think straight? As people don't want to be around you? And that kind of thing. And when you reflect upon that, I don't want to be angry right now, thank you very much. Let me be empty of anger.

**Speaker C:** That's the obvious one. That's the one that is pretty much, at least for me, easier to deal with. The more subtle one, or or the even intentional disguised one, the undercover craziness that can come up, people developed over so much time.

**Speaker A:** I will give you this, that when there's anger, the Dhamma is hard to remember. Sati is hard when we're already angry. It's better to see the anger coming and have the Sati so that you can get out of the way of the anger so you can stop it when it's stoppable. Just like imagining that a full-on anger is like a big truck running down the road at 100 miles an hour. If it runs into a brick wall, there's a lot of damage going on. But if you could slow that truck down to where it's only going at 1 mile an hour, when it hits that brick wall, there's not going to be much damage. It's okay. And so that's the whole idea, is to slow that anger down. And the quicker we catch it, the easier it is to slow it down and to stop it. And we need to be practiced at that. And the only way that I know how to practice it is by getting angry. So go around and hit your thumb with a hammer, or, you know, stumble around in the woods and fall, and then get angry at yourself, and then come out of that anger. Don't practice this when you're around other people. It's got consequences. You want to be empty of other people and then just go get angry, just with the intention of being able to stop it.

**Speaker C:** So right place, right time, from the lowest to the highest way of using it. I think there This is going to be an interesting time trying all the different ways to look for giving others some cues they don't resist so much.

**Speaker A:** Right. To see, to look. So I'm giving you permission actually to make anger a new toy to play with.

**Speaker C:** For me, it definitely is, for a long, long time. I mean.

**Speaker A:** Well, no, before it was a great big burden, it was a great big difficulty, it was a great big no-no, it was a great big Dukkha machine. And now I'm offering you to play with your anger like it was a toy. It's a toy to play with, it's your friend.

**Speaker C:** If you practice with a mind that is not filled with the appropriate ways to deal with anger or any other of the hindrances. I mean, translating that into a situation where it would be possible to help someone else to see that they're without the proper knowledge yourself.

**Speaker A:** Actually, Goenka has a story about that. He says that the very rich man who wanted to practice Buddhism, he hired a coach. He hired a guy to follow him around, and so that every time that the rich man broke a Dharma rule or whatever like that, the guy would come up and says, oh, kind sir, oh, you have just done this particular thing, please look at what you're doing. And after a while, the guy got really, really picked off, pissed off with this guy coming. And so he comes up and says, oh, Mr. Sir, you've gotten so much anger right now. And that's when he exploded. Don't tell me about you know, that kind of thing. And so, yes, having other people remind us of anger may be somewhat valuable, but we've got to actually be able to see it when they say it, that often we don't, that we will deny being angry. We're not supposed to be angry, how dare they claim that I'm angry? Yeah, I'm about to punch this guy that I've got by the collar, but I'm not angry. And so, recognizing that the anger is there. You'd be surprised at how angry you get, just a little bit. And recognizing that anger, recognize those little frustrations so that you can do something about it, like dropping it, coming out of it.

**Speaker C:** How do I do this for other people if they don't want to listen?

**Speaker A:** If they have the capacity— they have the capacity— it never was about them. It's always about you. Of course it was about you. You can't fix them. You can't fix them. That in fact, they can't fix themselves even if you tried to help them do it. Many, many couples get married with one or the other of them thinking that, oh, this is a diamond in the rough, oh, I'm going to polish him up. And 15 years later and a pile of sandpaper later, he has not been polished up at all. Okay, so we can't change others. It's hard enough for an individual to be able to see what he's doing on his own and make a change and picks it himself. This is why the teaching of the Buddha, especially the Second Noble Truth, is so hard.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's not so much about wanting them to change. It's more like in a playful way, making the situation more approachable. More helpful. I don't really know how to express this in English because English is not my native language.

**Speaker A:** I know, but that's all right. Never mind, start again. Never mind, keep looking. It works, you know it works. You've done it a lot, Vedana. You can do this. Of course, of course you can. And it's a very simple exercise. You've already been doing it. You can do it again.

**Speaker F:** If this is your.

**Speaker C:** Last answer, I'll leave it with that, but I will bother you with this again.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, start again. We can do this again. That's what it's all about, is getting in good practice and recognizing that we are doing it. We can do this. Of course. Thomas, you got your hand up.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was just thinking about the other side of the Yeah, you can't help anyone. You can't actually make, force your Dharma or whatever onto anyone else. But the other side is that no one else can either actually help you make a change, but also can't hurt you, make you be sad, suffer if you don't actually do it yourself too. So I think because obviously it happens to me too, it's so easy to say, oh no, there must be some way to make this person change and improve and be happier. But we also feel, oh, it's— I can't help but being hurt by others. And no, others can't actually hurt you, you hurt yourself. And you can't help others, but others have to help themselves. So it's interesting to see that the both sides of it. You can— that's it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we can't fix other people at all, especially if they don't want to be fixed. That often is hard for us to fix ourselves, especially when we ourselves don't want to be fixed. We're all like that. And in fact, that's part of the beauty of being able to help other people, is the only reason that I can help anybody is by pointing out that I've done this, this is, you know, that's all there is to it. And so we go from that way. But if you don't want my help, there's nothing that, you know, there's a lot of jokes about, oh, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. You can lead a human to knowledge but you can't make him think.

**Speaker C:** Maybe I just say that. Maybe this drops a penny.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can't make people think, you can't make them look and see, but you can give them a big smile.

**Speaker C:** It's so fun, you know, it's so fun to see if you found the the correct way to say it and the appropriate atmosphere. And all of a sudden someone else just sees what's going on. It's just so much fun, you know. And from this relative level, I'm just looking for different— yeah, I don't know this English word.

**Speaker A:** Oh, never mind. It's okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, it's totally fine.

**Speaker A:** Pedro, you got your hand up.

**Speaker E:** Yes, I would like to say that sometimes when you are with someone that knows a lot about the Dharma, it seems so far away, but when you are far from him, actually the Dharma becomes very, very near. Like it's the nearest thing you have all the time.

**Speaker A:** Right, there's your breath right there. You got to take this. Yeah, your choice, do it happily or not. That's— it's just right here.

**Speaker E:** Always available. Like.

**Speaker A:** The only thing that's far away is your thoughts. Everything else is close. The past is only in your thoughts. Other than that, it doesn't exist. So looking at what's around us, recognizing the past's not here, it's gone, and everything is okay right here, right now. This breath, this thought, this immediate present moment. That's what the Buddha gave himself, that name. That's what the word Tathagata means, is being right here in this present moment. And that's all there is to it, because where's the Dukkha? When you're here now, there's no Dukkha. It's only when we start thinking about things that the Dukkha keeps coming up. But when we're not thinking about it, we're just enjoying the present moment, there's no Dukkha here. Where's the Dukkha? You know, Sunyata, where is it? I don't see any Dukkha here. There's no Dukkha. Arahant, do you got any Dukkha? Do you have them? I don't see it.

**Speaker F:** When we get out of the conceptual world and we get into the real present moment, it's so much smaller. There is like so many less problems, I find.

**Speaker A:** You're saying that it's smaller, the present moment is smaller, is that what you're saying?

**Speaker F:** In a way it's way less complicated than the than the conceptual world, like it's only what's in front of you, right? There is no future organization, like planning and—.

**Speaker A:** I would say what a profound insight that actually is. There's so much to that, that our conceptualized world, there's no end to the concepts. It's a huge conceptual world. We can just concept this and concept that and all kinds of things going on. I can name a whole list of cities and people will start having images and concepts about those places. Okay, we just do it like that. And you're saying that when we come out of our conceptualized world, which there seems to be no end to, and come into the real world, it seems to be quite definite. Yeah, here it is. It's present, it's finite, it's real, it's busy, but it is right here in front of us. There's a sort of a quality to it that what I can see, I can see that's real, and what I can't see, let me not imagine because my imagination is not real. Let me stay with what's real. And that's the quality of being in the here-now, which is actually the quality then of the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. We can basically shine it up that way in the sense of when we come out of our ignorance about wanting things in the past and the future, or hating things from the past to the future, and we come out of that ignorance, now we can come into a state of joy. Being free from the Dukkha. And that's what the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path is really all about, is to come out of the Dukkha and come into the present moment, the here-now, because there's no problems here. Right here, right now is marvelous, it's wonderful, it's a paradise. But all the things that we don't like are not really here now, they're back then, they're over there, they're someplace else. But right here, right now, things are good enough. So as long as we stay in the present moment, we're free from Dukkha. That's all there is to it. It's so easy that in fact, Vedana, you can't even get angry at someone in the present moment. We always get angry from something that happened in the past, that if that guy gets angry at me, it doesn't— his anger doesn't trigger me, but my daddy's anger at me will trigger me. And so he just reminds me of my daddy. That's why I'm going to get up and beat his tail.

**Speaker C:** Do you remember when we talked about Robert, the young Robert from the UK, brought up topic of Anapanasati and things like that after he came from Wat Suamok. This is kind of a similar situation, but he just left the conversation because he wanted to talk to— he just wanted to share friendship and nobody of us really listened to what he was talking about. That's kind of a similar situation. It's totally fine. Everything is totally fine.

**Speaker A:** While a lot of people don't do psilocybin and other drugs, everybody takes the drug of anger. Everybody gets angry. So you're among good friends here. You're among company. Nothing to— I certainly have been there, done that. So there's no problem with getting angry. What's problematic is not watching it, letting it fly, letting it go, harming somebody. That's what's wrong with it, but watching it, catching it, putting it back in your pocket, nurturing it.

**Speaker C:** It's a couple, probably 10 years ago, that I did something without thinking before.

**Speaker A:** I did it. Well, now can you forgive yourself for that? You wouldn't do that again, I'm sure, right? The Veda that we have right here today would not do that.

**Speaker C:** That's actually a lot of the practice for the last couple of months, restoring the positive qualities as counterbalances for the traumas that are in the system, which is actually It reached the point now where it's become very amusing, amusing to see, or not only amusing, of course everything is a moving target. So I'm talking in solidity where there is none. I hope that's understandable in a way.

**Speaker A:** Well, the important point that I'm making is that now you would not do that, that that was a Vedana that's in the past.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I don't know that. I don't know that.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you can begin to say that, okay? That look how— look at the regret that you have right now for doing that.

**Speaker F:** Everything.

**Speaker A:** Is okay. So with that regret, we can say, well, I'm not going to have that kind of regret again. I'm not going to do that kind of stuff again. I'm going to be more mindful. I'm not going to make that make that mistake again, right? But this is what real renunciation is about, is that it builds up mindfulness. It's not just taking a vow, oh, I'll never do that again. No, this is, I'm not going to do that. Okay, so once you take that on, now you can forgive yourself because you're not going to do it anymore. You can in fact allow that part of you in the past to be your future. Thank you for showing me what a stupid thing that was to do. I'm glad you did it so that I don't have to, right? Okay. And make friends with that past person because that's not who you are anymore. Sort of forgive him for screwing up.

**Speaker C:** Will do.

**Speaker A:** That you're all right now, that whatever you did 10 years ago, at least you survived and here you are.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's kind of the same thing with me, with the cigarettes, you know, that I'm trying to stop since I've started. And still, I get up and I smoke that cigarette. But like, I try to be more mindful every time, but wow, It's really a fucking battle, you know.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I see that. I see that. Okay, so that's what you can say. What word did you do? Did you use something like fucking bastard? Is that what you said?

**Speaker E:** Fucking battle, battle.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you can say, aha, I see you joyfully rather than hating that quality in you. That we learn to accept who we are happily, knowing that if I can catch that dude in his act, I can put a stop to him. But if I want to ignore him because I don't like him, because it's not me, then I can in fact do it again. But when I make the point, oh, I'm not going to do that anymore, and I'm going to watch to make sure that I don't, then I can be okay, then I'm not going to do it again. So I can forgive myself for having done it in the past. And in fact, there's a place in the Bible where Jesus is talking about that, where the girl is about to get stoned and all the guys— and he says, he who goes without sin, cast the first stone. And nobody's willing to hit her. And he says, go and sin no more. Okay, so this is how we take those kind of regrets. We take those big things— that time that I got angry at the cop, you know, that kind of stuff— and we say, I'm not going to do that anymore. And now we can forgive ourselves and go and not do that again. I'm going to go and I'm not going to do that kind of crap again. I will sin no more. So that's the kind of attitude that we develop. And that is what gives us the, ultimately the freedom.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and actually I've seen that it works for everything. Like the mechanism is the same, the good habit of doing this is the same and works with everything. Like from anger to excessive food to, you know, uh, hating the job, relationships.

**Speaker A:** One size fits all occasions. That's exactly right. That's what makes the teaching of the Buddha so downright simple. You don't have to tweak it for every occasion. It fits every time. Yes, Pedro, you're exactly right. It one size fits all. All we have to do is look at what we're doing, recognize it's good and change and then congratulate ourselves for changing. So the Eightfold Noble Path is one-size-fits-all occasions for all people, if we can remember. So why don't we do it? Yeah, let's leave it with that. That's actually what the original question from Cat was. I think he's left already. Was about that sutta. Okay, let's get our stuff together, get that unification of mind going, and then we're— I wouldn't think of getting angry anymore. I don't need to get angry anymore. I'm okay already anymore. You know, that's the kind of way that we, we go for it. See you, Vedana. Bye-bye, everybody. Thank you, Jesus. Bye, everybody.

**Speaker C:** Thank you for the talk.

**Speaker A:** Anna, I'm glad to see you still. Good one.

**Speaker F:** Thank you guys. Bye-bye.

**Speaker D:** Bye, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye guys. Have fun without me.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on **MN 117, the "Great Forty" (Mahācattārīsaka Sutta)**, which presents the Noble Eightfold Path from an enlightened perspective. Here is a summary of the key points discussed:

### **Core Theme: Two Orders of the Path**
The talk contrasts the **ordinary path** with the **noble (enlightened) path**:
*   **Ordinary Path (for beginners):** **Sīla → Samādhi → Paññā** (Virtue → Concentration → Wisdom). This is where everyone starts, like scaffolding for a building. We begin with rules (sīla) to structure behavior and calm the mind.
*   **Noble Path (for the awakened):** **Paññā → Samādhi → Sīla** (Wisdom → Concentration → Virtue). This is the path as seen from the fruit of enlightenment. It starts with **right view**—the wisdom of seeing things as they are (the Four Noble Truths). From this wisdom, true concentration (samādhi) arises, leading to **natural, effortless virtue** because you no longer have the desire or intention to harm.

### **The "Great Forty" (MN 117)**
*   The sutta's name comes from multiplying the **Eightfold Path factors** (8) **plus two additional factors—right knowledge & right deliverance** (10) in a specific way (wholesome vs. unwholesome, presence vs. absence) to reach 40.
*   Its core teaching is that on the noble path, **right view comes first**. You cannot be on the noble path without already having some degree of right view (understanding of Dukkha and its cessation).

### **Key Practice Instructions**
1.  **Sati (Mindfulness) as "Waking Up":** Mindfulness is likened to being tapped on the shoulder while absorbed in a book. It's the moment of waking up from daydreams, thoughts, and stories into present-moment reality. The instruction is to **wake up, look, and investigate** your state of mind repeatedly.
2.  **Change at the Thought Level:** The practice happens in the mind before action. Unwholesome thoughts lead to unwholesome speech and action. The path is about **catching thoughts, evaluating them** (are they wholesome/satisfying or unwholesome/dissatisfying?), and **changing them** toward wholesomeness and reality.
3.  **The Interplay of Factors:** Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness "run and circle around each other," reinforcing one another. This builds energy and skill in waking up and making mental changes.
4.  **From Effort to Unremitting Energy:** Through gladdening the mind, what starts as diligent effort transforms into **unremitting energy and enthusiasm** for the Dhamma. You become "spring-loaded" for wholesome states.
5.  **Cultivating Emptiness (Suññatā):** A major theme is learning to see **what is absent**. Look for the fear, anger, or craving that is *no longer there*. This leads to a spacious, uncluttered mind and the profound peace of "nothing happening."
6.  **Anapanasati as the Core Practice:** Referencing Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, the talk suggests **anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** is the primary meditation practice taught by the Buddha, fulfilling the *Satipaṭṭhāna* (Foundations of Mindfulness) and leading to the factors of enlightenment.

### **On Enlightenment, Knowledge & Deliverance**
*   **Enlightenment** is explained with a double meaning: 1) **Shedding light** (knowledge, seeing clearly) and 2) **Becoming light** (deliverance, dropping the burden).
*   The two added factors in MN 117—**right knowledge** (of the Four Noble Truths) and **right deliverance** (the act of letting go)—encapsulate this. True enlightenment requires both seeing and releasing.

### **Practical Advice for Challenges**
*   **Anger & Hindrances:** Treat hindrances like anger as **toys for practice**. The goal is to see them sooner, slow them down, and let them go. Practice in private if needed. Remember, if you don't accept someone's "gift" of anger, it remains theirs.
*   **Dealing with Others:** You cannot force the Dhamma on others. The focus must always be on your own mind. The best way to help is to **maintain your own cheerfulness and kindness** ("sprinkle sugar"), without getting stuck in their resistance (the "tar baby" parable).
*   **Self-Forgiveness:** For past mistakes, recognize that the person who did that is not who you are now. Thank that past self for the lesson, resolve not to repeat it, and **forgive yourself**. This is true renunciation.

### **Ultimate Goal: Unification of Mind**
The culmination of the path is a **unified mind**—free from inner conflict, doubt, and craving. In this state, virtue is natural because there is no desire to harm, take, or lie. You are "on top of your own pile of dirt," at peace in the present moment where, as the talk concludes, **"right here, right now, things are good enough."**

**In essence:** The talk is a practical guide to flipping the script from struggling with rules to living from wisdom. It emphasizes moment-to-moment mindfulness to see and release unwholesome states, thereby naturally arriving at the peaceful, virtuous mind that is the goal of the Noble Eightfold Path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly focusing on the Eightfold Noble Path and the transition from an ordinary to a noble practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **Scaffolding and Building:** This is the central metaphor.
    *   **Ordinary Path (Sila first):** Rules (Sila) are like **scaffolding** erected to build a structure. They are necessary to start, define the shape, and provide support, but they are not the final building.
    *   **Noble Path (Pañña first):** Once wisdom (Pañña) is developed, the scaffolding can be removed. You can then build "wisely, without plans," and the resulting structure has a natural integrity. The metaphor illustrates how rules are preliminary training wheels, not the ultimate goal.

2.  **Waking Up / Tap on the Shoulder:** Mindfulness (Sati) is compared to **waking up from sleep** or the moment someone **taps you on the shoulder** while you're absorbed in a book. It's a sudden shift in frame of reference from mental absorption (daydreams, thoughts) back to present-moment reality.

3.  **Spring-Loaded for the Dhamma:** As practice deepens, right effort transforms from a struggle into unremitting energy. This is likened to being **spring-loaded**, like a jack-in-the-box, eagerly ready and responsive to the Dhamma.

4.  **Pile of Dirt / Emperor:** Every person is the **emperor of their own pile of dirt** (their life, their "crap"). The spiritual goal (Lokottara Dhamma) is to get **on top of that pile** rather than being buried under it.

5.  **Clay Pot with Chili Paste:** The mind's ingrained habits are like a **clay mortar used to crush hot chilies**. Even after cleaning, the spicy residue remains and taints everything. This explains why the Dhamma must be heard and practiced repeatedly—to gradually cleanse these deep-seated tendencies.

6.  **Tar Baby (from Uncle Remus):** Used to caution against forcing the Dhamma on others. If you engage with someone who is resistant (the tar baby), you just get stuck. The lesson: if people don't want the teaching, don't engage; let them be and keep your own peace.

7.  **Anger as a Runaway Truck:** Full-blown anger is like a **truck going 100 mph**—it causes massive damage upon impact. The practice is to catch it early and slow it down to **1 mph**, where the "collision" causes little to no harm.

8.  **Third Eye:** Referenced as a **metaphor for clear, unremitting seeing** (Vipassana), not a literal eye. It signifies continuous investigation without coming to fixed conclusions.

9.  **Sea Foam / Bubbles:** Moments of experience are like **sea foam or bubbles** that constantly arise and pop, illustrating impermanence and the unreality of solid phenomena.

10. **Light and Lightness (Enlightenment):** The word "enlightenment" is broken into two metaphorical parts:
    *   **Light:** Shining a light on the subject, gaining knowledge and clarity.
    *   **Lightness:** Dropping the burden, becoming "light" and unburdened. True enlightenment involves both.

11. **Two Kinds of Happiness:**
    *   **Fulfilling Hunger:** The temporary happiness of getting what you want.
    *   **Freedom from Hunger:** The deeper happiness of not wanting anything, of already being satisfied.

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Angry Man and the Buddha's Feast:** (Referenced, not told in full). When an angry person rants at the Buddha, the Buddha replies that it's like preparing a feast (of anger) that the guest (the Buddha) refuses to eat. The anger therefore remains with the one who brought it.

2.  **The Woman Caught in Adultery:** (Referenced, from the Bible). Jesus says, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone," and then tells the woman, "Go and sin no more." The speaker uses this to illustrate the attitude of forgiving one's past mistakes while firmly resolving not to repeat them.

3.  **The Rich Man and His Dhamma Coach:** (Attributed to S.N. Goenka). A rich man hires a coach to point out his every mistake. He eventually explodes with anger at the coach, who then points out *that* anger. The story shows that external reminders can backfire if one isn't ready to see their own faults.

4.  **The James Webb Telescope:** Used as a modern analogy for **right view**. Just as the telescope's new data challenges old astronomical models, we must always be ready to look anew and let go of fixed views ("supposed to bes").

5.  **Bicycle Accidents:** We remember painful or dangerous events (like bike accidents) vividly due to their emotional charge, while forgetting countless uneventful rides. This explains how the mind clings to negative memories, creating a burden of "false positives."

### **Overall Narrative:**
The talk itself follows a **story of progression**: from being a **child** who needs rules (scaffolding), to a **beginner meditator** sitting in the hall, to someone who **wakes up** (tap on the shoulder), develops wisdom, and becomes **noble**—eventually becoming like a **lion** or an **emperor** on top of their world, **spring-loaded** with joyful energy for the Dhamma, and able to see the **emptiness** and **lightness** of a liberated mind.
