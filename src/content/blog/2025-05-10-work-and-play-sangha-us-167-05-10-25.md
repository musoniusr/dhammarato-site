### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome everyone. This is Saturday morning at 9 AM. It's evening time in the United States and we've got small group today compared to how many people we've had before, but I think that more people will be joining. Hello, Char, glad to see you.

**Speaker B:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** So we have a good topic today. Was asked of how to make our work play. And that basically, when we're children, we are taken away from our play. We would rather play with our toys and play around, but we're grabbed and put into school and told to work. Learn your ABCs, learn your 1-2-3s, do all of that kind of stuff. And children then, because of our society, generally fall out of love with life. They fall out of their playful attitude and playful mood, and go into a work mentality, as if we had something important to do, and that it was dangerous if we don't do it. In fact, that's the way that people see school, is that it's a dangerous place. And that we have to work. And we grow up with that mentality all through our school years, even into the work. And so what we do is that we give up our freedom and our joy that we had in childhood because we're told to, and almost in a sense forced to. We don't have much choice about it. Does this ring true for any of you here?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. How about you, Ben? What do you think? Uh, we can play at any age. Work doesn't have to be work, right? Depends on your attitude. But very few of us ever get that opportunity to play in life. After about the age of 3 or 4, life becomes a job. You have to do what you're told to do. That also puts us in a mentality of being, uh, let us say, subject to other people's business. If we can't mind our own business, we have to do what we're told to do. Smokey Joe, does this ring True for you?

**Speaker C:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Simon?

**Speaker B:** For sure.

**Speaker D:** Not making a choice can still be your choice.

**Speaker A:** Well, when we have no choice, our choice is to do what we're told to do. How about you, Clay?

**Speaker E:** In my experience, it hasn't been like that. Not really.

**Speaker D:** I think that, or you maybe fall into the bad, like maybe you don't— you take the low road. Maybe you don't do so well in society.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I don't know, like, in my experience, maybe I've gotten lucky, but all the jobs I've had have been pretty fun so far. I've learned a lot, and, you know, I started multiple businesses throughout school. I did those things, and it was all fun. It was all play for me, and I just learned a bunch. So I never really worked a job where I was like, bored out of my mind, and I wasn't having fun.

**Speaker A:** You're fortunate. May you continue that. For all of you, there is a way out of that. Hello, Anna, welcome. Looks like we're getting quite a crowd coming in now. So Today's talk is basically kind of a one-two situation, a one-two punch. A lot of people think that the spiritual path is all just one thing and you keep going and keep going, but in fact there's, um, ways that we can deal with it. One would be to say the inside and then the outside. And so, uh, Ivan had mentioned something about that. We are really in the practice of the Dharma. We need to get the inside situation, our internal system, fixed. And once we have that fixed, then we can go and deal with the outside world. Now, when we get started in practice, we almost always bring in the crowd with us— all of our thoughts, all of our feelings. That in fact, the story is about when people are going to do a meditation retreat, their retreat is that the first few days of it They're thinking about how they got there. They're thinking about the past. During the middle part of the retreat, they begin to see what's going on and they don't like it very much. And then the end of the retreat, everybody's eager to leave and they're planning on the future. And so most of the time in retreats, they're wasting their time. Because in the time that they are spending in the present moment, they don't like it very much. That in fact, it's good to review that the Buddha says that he only teaches one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's all there is, nothing else. What does that mean then? It means then that life has dissatisfactions. Things happen and we don't want it to happen. Things don't happen that we want to happen. We don't get what we want. And not getting what we want, or having to put up with the things that we don't want to put up with, that's the definition of Dukkha. With an important quality to that, and that is that we do this in ignorance. We don't do it by watching what we're doing. So there are several skills that need to be developed, and that we're going to do those skill developments in seclusion. What does seclusion mean? Well, you can either go way off— the Buddha says go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, And the quality of empty hut would be then that you could actually just go to your room because it's empty of people. It might be full of stuff, junk, toys, all kinds of games and things. But you can basically say that when you're alone in your room, then it's empty of other people. And we can then start to develop several skills, and one of the skills to develop is the skill of feeling safe and secure. Now, when people are sitting in practice, they'll all generally, especially for the beginner, will have all kinds of thoughts that come up about what needed to be done or what happened that needed to be fixed, etc. Like that, we spent a lot of time in the past and a lot of time into the future. And what the real practice of the Buddha is, based upon some very clear evidence about the Eightfold Noble Path, is that we need to pay attention to what's happening right now, what's happening right now on the inside. Which means paying attention to what's happening within the body, paying attention to what's happening in our feelings, paying attention to our mental attitude and mental states, and paying attention to what's happening in the mind when it's in that particular state, which means thoughts. And generally what we're going to be practicing is coming out of all the unwholesome thoughts. And we can think of it in this way, is that any thoughts that are in the past or any thoughts are in the future are not real. That what we will spend our time doing is being in the present moment. So the thoughts that we're going to be having are thoughts about what's happening right now. Now In the Eightfold Noble Path, especially in Majjhima Nikaya number 117, the Buddha was very specific about three items. Number one is Sati, to remember. Number two is Ditti, to look. Looking in this sense is a verb. It's not looking in the sense of remembering or having concepts or ideas or place, far away places, or down the block, or any of that kind of stuff, but really looking at what's happening right now in the mind, looking at what kind of attitude we have. So if we can see the attitude and see the thoughts that we're having, see them clearly, that means that we have a chance to be able to change them. This is where right noble effort comes in, is the effort that it takes to make an improvement, to make changes right here, right now. Now, when we're around a whole lot of people, that means then that it's hard to do that because they want you to think about and focus on whatever they're thinking about. But when you're in seclusion, you can begin to move away from all of that kind of stuff and just be with yourself right here, right now, having thoughts that are wholesome, having thoughts that are beneficial to right now. So if we can find a way of feeling good right now, we can gladden the mind, brighten the mind, change our attitude, which will help change the feeling so that we can feel comfortable. We can feel safe and secure, and that will lead us to the important point of satisfaction. We've learned to become satisfied with what we're doing right here, right now. Wow, what a relief it is just to sit and enjoy the moment. No place to go, nothing to do, and everything is just okay. So this is the way that we begin to practice, and we need to practice this over and over again because we're quite in the habit of, um, doing whatever we've been in the habit of doing, including thinking about what needs to be done, thinking about what's broken, thinking about all the stuff that happened in the past, reminiscing and that we can instead take our time while we're practicing to just chill out in the state of satisfaction that everything is okay right now. And so we have to basically talk ourselves into it because people don't like that. They're not used to it. They're not used to being in a state of being satisfied. Now, one of the most important qualities of satisfaction is that when we are actually satisfied, that means that we are free from dissatisfaction. This is basically the entire teaching of the Buddha. Can you get yourself into a state of satisfaction to where everything is okay, everything is fine? If we can do that, then we can begin to practice sustaining that and get that going over and over and over again, to keep coming back to everything is okay, everything is fine, it's comfortable, it's safe and satisfying. This is what is referred to as gladdening the mind, and we gladden the mind or brighten the mind by having wholesome thoughts. Wholesome thoughts like I've been saying: everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Wow, this is so great. And as we begin to have one wholesome thought after another after another, we can begin to put gaps in those thoughts, always remembering that when the mind starts up again, it's going to start up also in the wholesome. So that we start with wholesome thoughts, we continue those wholesome thoughts, we begin to put gaps in those wholesome thoughts, and then come back to the wholesome thoughts. This is the way that we do it over and over and over again. So this means that we can develop a new habit rather than relying upon the old habits of ordinary we begin to have new habits, habits of being satisfied. Over and over again, I have to keep repeating that because a lot of people will start practice, get a little bit of results, and then quit. Most people also will start practice, not get any results at all, and quit because they're not practicing properly. And so practicing properly means to Start with the wholesome and stay with the wholesome. Keep repeating and repeating and repeating. Make sure that you're doing it like that. And what happens with almost everyone in the beginning is they'll have a wholesome thought intentionally, like, wow, I feel good, and then they'll have a thought, no, I don't. Or they'll have the thought, wow, I am satisfied, and then and you say, "Well, wait a minute, it's not satisfying enough." Or we'll have a thought like, "Wow, I really feel good, I feel joyful, but it's not joyful enough." When you can see that those secondary thoughts come in that actually contradict the practice, that's just going back to the old style of thinking. The way that we were raised. And so we need to be mindful, which means to remember to look, that those unwholesome thoughts are going to pop right back up. And then we become discouraged. Oh, we become discouraged because I thought I was having wholesome thoughts, but they didn't stick. And this is why we have to keep practicing over and over and over again so that we can keep bringing these wholesome thoughts back up. We're actually, in a way, creating new habits. So as we progress, we progress into building the skill of being satisfied. Now, um, uh, Ivan mentioned an old monk, Achan Puang, who said that when we're in the secluded state, when we're actually watching what's happening in the mind, he said to do it as if other people are there, other people are watching you. Well, now what that actually means is that we need to really bring our focus, our attention to the fore, We begin to watch ourselves actually in a way from the outside, almost as if we were on stage performing for other people. So we begin to practice, "I see that, I see that." The Buddha had a phrase called, "Aha, I see you, Mara." What that means is that those secondary thoughts that come up that kind of destroy the practice that we're having, we can say, I see that. And by doing that, we're actually changing our attitude back into a wholesome attitude again. We're actually bringing in that joyful quality of, aha, I see you. And we can practice this over and over again until we can get our minds into a state to where we can feel really Good. Now, yes, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** You talked about earlier that sometimes beginners, when they see like a glimpse of satisfaction, that they get tripped up on there. They're actually shocked and they don't know how to handle it. I think I'm one of those people. So could you explain a little bit further about how those people fall into that trap and what they should do to get out of that trap?

**Speaker A:** Actually, I wouldn't call it a trap. I would just call it old habits.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And if you can begin to see your old habits, you can begin to accept them, that they're all right, that that's who you've been all along and you didn't know it. Now that you're beginning to see it, people don't like it. They don't want to see the way that things actually have been for all of this time. They want to be able to change into the wholesome and have it magically stay there, but it doesn't stick. That in fact, you can say that we need to actually put some intensity or intention into it. And the analogy that I've used is in the Old Southwest, when they built a house, they would build it with adobe. How many of you have heard about adobe? It's nothing but mud. And what they would do is that after they would put up the frame of the structure, they would put the mud on it. But if you just put the mud on it, the mud's going to slide off. You have to actually throw the mud on it so that it sticks. And so in this case, we're actually going to take the effort or the energy to have these wholesome thoughts stick. And we keep doing that over and over again, and pretty soon we've got enough wholesome thoughts sticking that all the cracks are filled in, and the adobe house is worth living in. And so we keep throwing this stuff, throwing it and throwing it. Yeah, I am feeling good. Right, everything really is okay. And put some effort, put some intensity in it. Right noble effort that I'm all right, I'm okay. 'Never mind all of these old unwholesome thoughts that I've had so long. I'm going to start right now having some good, happy, wholesome thoughts.' And we keep practicing that over and over again, and guess what? It begins to stick. It begins to stick. Just begins to stick. Those old unhappy thoughts are going to keep coming back, maybe for many years. Until you keep practicing over and over again. Don't give up. Keep it going. You— in fact, one of the things that I've heard from students is, is that, wow, I practiced for a while, then I got myself into a really, really good state, but it didn't stay. Oh, poor me. Well, they're not practicing when they have that old poor me. They want that really happy state back again. And I'll say that that really, really happy, wow, everything is really great state is what's normally referred to in Buddhism as the first Jhana. That first Jhana has the qualities of being absolutely free from any unwholesome states at all. That we apply the mind and we sustain the mind over and over and over again to change our attitude into a wholesome, happy winner's attitude. I can do this. And then that helps us with the feeling, so that we begin to actually feel safe, secure, and satisfied. And as we continue to practice, we bring in the fourth item. And that fourth item is confidence, Shraddha. And what this means then is that you take these three things of Sati, Remember to keep coming back. Remember to remember to remember to be in the present moment. When we say remembering, we're not talking about remembering the past or remembering to do stuff. We're talking about remembering to be in the present moment so that we can look at what the body, the feelings, the mind states, and the mind objects are doing. That in fact, when I say them, the body, the feelings, the mind objects, and the states of mind. This is called the Satipatthana. And now the Satipatthana has the quality of this is all you are. This is your whole show. Which means then that this practice of Anapanasati is actually a complete practice. A lot of people think that meditation is focusing on a particular object. In the old days they would do fire meditation of looking at a fire. Or looking into the river or looking into a crystal ball or whatever like that. But this is more of a practice that we have to move around a little bit, making sure that this is okay, making sure that's okay, making sure this is all right and all of that, so that you're completely safe and secure in your feelings, in your attitude. The body is relaxed. The body is comfortable, because if the body is in discomfort, guess what? You can't practice. You can't practice. If the body is uncomfortable, you're already in a state of dissatisfaction. So we need then to get the body in the state of comfort. We can use the breathing to help relax. We can use the gladdening of the mind and the thoughts to actually change our attitude. And with the attitude and the body in a very safe, comfortable place, we can then begin to work on the feelings so that the feelings also make you feel, "I feel safe, I feel comfortable, everything really is all right." And we have to put some effort and some energy in to keep doing that over and over and over again. This is one's right practice. Now, some teachers in some places, they talk about doing this as a retreat. And so you'll do a retreat this month and get all disappointed with it, and you'll do another retreat and say, wait a minute, I don't want to do it. But in fact, I have heard by some really reliable sources that actually work within the retreat system that people will go for a long time between retreats because they're not getting good results out of the retreat. But going to retreat and then later a retreat next month and then later a retreat next month, that's not going to do it. That we need to develop a daily practice. But then they say, well, why don't you then practice for 1 hour a day? But that's also not enough practice. We're actually going to be changing the habit patterns that you have developed over the past 20 or 30 or 40 years. And so we need to practice more often than that. Now, there's two ways of practicing. One is every time you remember whatever you're doing, you can— if you're at your job, at your work, and let us say working on a PC or maybe digging a shovel full of dirt, You can stand that shovel up, or you can close your eyes at the keyboard and just take a deep breath and relax. Wow. And then having some wholesome thoughts for maybe 5 minutes or so. If we can do this every hour and get into the habit of having happy thoughts, then those happy thoughts will begin to fill in those 55 minutes. But it's also good to spend a bit of time every day in the longer sitting. And so we can combine the two practices of sitting for a longer period of time, say 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes. And in fact, as you develop, you can extend that into an hour. But then we're going to be practicing all throughout the day. Maybe for 5 minutes or every hour, maybe 5 minutes every 2 hours. If you're at a bus stop, if you're in the bank, wherever you are where you've got to wait, that's an excellent time to practice. Wow, I don't have anything to do right now. Instead of saying, oh, hurry up, I want these people to get out of my way. At the bank so that I can get there and get my business done and get out of here. That's the normal mentality. A much better mentality is, wow, I'm so glad there's people in line in front of me. That gives me an opportunity to just sit here and relax. Wow, what a nice thing. And you can actually just do that in what you would call seclusion instead of chatting people up or spending your time like that. You can actually place your mind in a good state wherever you're waiting for something. If you're waiting for food coming to the restaurant, if you're waiting for— standing in the checkout line at the grocery store, whatever it is, when you're not doing anything, that's the time to practice. Practice everything is okay and everything is fine. Wow, I'm glad that this old fat lady in front of me has got too many groceries. That just gives me a time to stand here and relax and let her get her business done, and then I'll check out my groceries too. So now, once we have that established, that we can in fact sit down and bring ourselves into a really, really, really nice state, the question is, can we get up and maintain that really nice state? Can we keep going? And if we can't, that means, well, let's come back and practice again and again and again so that we can get ourselves into a really, really beautiful, nice state. Wow, this is so nice! We have the feelings of, well, I feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied, and everything is all right. And while I can I can do this. And so that's that first Jhana, especially that part of it of, wow, I can do this. I'm on top of the world. No matter how obstructed that the mind becomes, no matter what kind of difficulties come by, I can handle it. I can do this. Everything is fine. The laptop dies, it won't crank up, or it's got some silly stuff on the screen that's not usable. Am I going to feel bad because the computer died? It wasn't me that died, it was just a PC. I'll be okay. Everything is all right. Not a problem in the world. In fact, when the PC dies, that's a really opportunity to say, wow, I'm glad that PC died. It's dead meat now. It won't work at all. That gives me a chance to just relax. Everything's all right. Not a problem in the world. And so we keep coming back to this over and over and over again. And then Ivan mentioned the point about going into the world and dealing with people the same way that we're being able to deal with ourselves in seclusion. In other words, can't nobody wreck my joy. Keep that going. If somebody gives you a hard time, your best response to them is just to smile. Have the compassion to smile. Don't go join their pity party. Keep your joy. And if you can't keep your joy, you can say, wait a minute, I'm going to go for a break. I'm going to go back and get my joy again. I'm going to go practice again. And then we can come back to the world and deal with the world joyfully. We can deal with the world, in fact, as if the world does not even exist. So with that kind of state, that means that now we can approach any activity, do anything that we want to do, and do it happily, because we were trained to get the job done. It doesn't matter how you feel. You just get the job done. Well, now we're changing that upside down completely. It doesn't matter whether you do the job or not. The important thing is, can you maintain that 'wow, everything is all right' kind of state? So let me draw a kind of an OK Corral. You've probably heard of the OK Corral in the sense of the old gunslingers, but Eric Byrne brought in a new OK Corral, and I'm making a change to that. And that is that you've got a quadrant. You've got that which is on the left and the right side, and you've got that which is over and under. So let us say then that on the left side we're going to do the job, and on the right side we're not going to do the job. We've got a choice. We're either going to do it or not do it. And then on the upper and the lower, we have on the lower side that we're going to approach it feeling bad because that's our habit. We've been feeling bad our whole lives. Let's go ahead and do whatever we're going to do or not do whatever we want to do, but we're going to stay feeling bad. But in this practice, we're removing as much of the doing as we can to just sit there and work on feeling good, work on feeling everything is okay, becoming satisfied, really, really deeply satisfied with what life is. And so we go from the lower to the upper. Now, once we have that quadrant going, that means then that we have a choice about whether we're going to do it or not. But we're always going to make that choice being happy. Our choice is everything is okay. And now we can have that choice of everything is okay, and we either do it or we don't do it. And so now we can go do something happily. And when we find ourselves getting caught up in what we're doing so that we're not so happy about it, the best thing to do is to stop whatever you're doing and go back to nothingness so that you can gain your happiness, your joy, your satisfaction again, and then go back to the job and do it happily. In other words, we're changing everything upside down from the way that we've lived our whole lives. In the old days, we always had that we've got to do the job no matter how we feel. Now we're going to maintain the position of it's how I feel is more important than whether we do the job or not. Now everybody's heard this phrase of if you don't work, you don't eat. Well, guess what? Most people have a job that pays them far more money than they need just to eat. That we, in fact, we have the four requisites of just enough food, just enough shelter, just enough clothing to protect the body, and just enough health care, just enough medication. And what happens when we have a job that gives us all of that stuff, plus a whole lot more? Then we go get bored, we go buy stuff we don't need, etc., like that. But if you can find a way of being satisfied with your life, that means that you don't have to work nearly as much to get the things that you actually need to have. So we can stop working so hard. We can take life easy. There's no reason to be a CEO of a giant corporation with all the problems of running a big corporation. It's easier just to be the janitor and just clean the little place up here. I'm having fun here. So look at your whole life as if you were having fun, but that's a developed state. That we need to go back and practice over and over and over again, practice having fun at doing very little or nothing. And when we get very, very good at being happy doing nothing, then we can start doing a little bit, making sure that we maintain our happiness and our joy. And eventually we may be able to do a lot. And still maintain that happiness and our joy. But very few people ever do that. In fact, you could say that the way the life of the monk is giving the monks time to just be happy. There's very, very little chores that are done at a Buddhist monastery, and the chores that are done are done happily, which is completely different than the chores that I've seen at a Christian monastery, where they've got scheduled. You got to get up and pray, then you got to go to breakfast, and while you're at breakfast you got to pray. And then when you're finished breakfast, you got to clean up, and then when you're finished that, you got to go pray again. And then when you're finishing that, you got to go to the workshop, and you got to work and work and work. Then you go to lunch, and you got to pray. Okay, so they put you on a schedule, and guess what? That schedule is not much different than the way that your life was when you were in the first grade. But with the Buddhist monastery, everything is just so easy. So begin to live your life as if you were a monk, where you got no place to go and nothing to do, and your only job is to keep your mind in a really good, happy state. Wherever you go, whatever you do, your feelings are more important than anything else. Your body is relaxed, your feelings are feeling, wow, this is great. Your attitude is the attitude of a winner, and your thoughts are wholesome. This is the way that we begin to live our lives and continue that way. So does anybody have any suggestions or questions or whatever? How about you, Clay?

**Speaker E:** I think I asked the question that I wanted to ask. Earlier, just about, you know, becoming surprised with how satisfied that you can be after living basically in a hole for a long time. Yeah, I think that was pretty much it. Because like, I think I did exactly what you said, like I was seeing some fruit of practice. And then I got a little bit scared by how satisfied I was because for a long time I thought it was impossible.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, it's— yeah, you're not supposed to feel good. You've heard that message before. You're not supposed to feel good. You're supposed to get the job done.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so now guess what? The fear that you're experiencing when you have the joy is, wait a minute, Wait a minute, but that fear that we're talking about is not a new fear. It's an old fear. It's the old fear of not being able to get what you're supposed to do. And many people even, in fact, are saying, I don't deserve this kind of joy. I haven't done what I should do. I haven't laid enough bricks, or I haven't cured enough sick people, or I haven't dug enough ditches to feel good. Well, guess what? You don't have to do anything. Just feel good. And when we begin to feel that fear coming up, we can say, "Aha, I see that fear. Wow, that fear is preventing me from being really joyful right now. Let me take a deep breath and just let that go. Whoa, I'm really glad I saw that fear.".

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I'm really glad I saw it because otherwise I've been fearful my whole life and I haven't been able to see it at all.

**Speaker D:** I have a question.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Do you think it's easier to catch an unwholesome state like fear or anger earlier on as it hits you and sort of sidestep it? Or do you think it's pretty much the same? Like, is it like a false idea that it would be more difficult to catch yourself further and say, "Arahant"?

**Speaker A:** All right, here's the answer to that. The answer to that is that this is a process, and it's a process of developing skill. That in fact, in the suttas, for every step of the Anapanasati practice, it has "thus one trains oneself." So we'll have a wholesome thought followed by an unwholesome thought. No, never mind. We're going to have wholesome thoughts, and we train ourselves to have wholesome thoughts. We train ourselves to gladden the mind. We train ourselves to bring on a new attitude. We train ourselves to feel happy, to feel good, to feel peaceful, to feel satisfied. And we train to have the body feel relaxed and comfortable. This is a training. And so see it as skill development. That's in fact exactly why we call it practice. We don't call it meditation. Meditation is something that most people have no clue about. We're not interested in meditation. In fact, meditation is often referred to as contemplation, trying to figure something out. And here we're not trying to figure out anything. We're not trying to get it right. We're just relaxing, just feeling comfortable and good and satisfied. That's all there is to it. So let's see, how about you, Alex? What do you think? Everything is okay. I really like it. Thank you so much for the talk about it. All right. How about you, Baked Potato? What do you think? Baked Potato, are you still with us? All right, maybe later. How about you, Anna? What do you have to say? Well, it's great. Thank you, Dhammarato. I will try to come every Friday as much as I can. Yes, glad to see you. So let's be joyful when dealing with those unhappy people. Amen. Ah, Avery, good to see you, my friend. What you been up to, and what do you think about today's talk? How about you, Char? Do you have anything to say? A lot of people chilling out. Who is that?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no, I was just saying he— they said they don't have anything to say. They wrote it in the chat.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** Oh, no, I'm just replying Char and Bad Potato. They say they have nothing to say, because, yeah, they wrote it in down the text there, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, how about you then, Ivan? What do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Not much, it's really, I really need to hear that again. It's a really nice reminder, I was kind of reflecting how quick the mind can be sometimes. I really, really, really felt like I was in that old state of mind where it just, I don't know how to explain, it just feels like that old conditioning and it feels really real. And then it's like it's telling me, this is it, I'm going to die, everything's over. Or whatever. But when I really just make the right effort to relax and be here now, I'm just surprised how quickly it goes away. It just vanished so quickly. It's almost like it tricks me. It tricks me into believing that conditioning. So, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker D:** I used to really— you know, the Protestant work ethic?

**Speaker A:** You know?

**Speaker D:** You ever heard that term?

**Speaker A:** Yes, certainly.

**Speaker D:** I used to struggle with that, I think.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that in fact they make work an ethical problem, that you're a bad person if you don't work. You got to take care of all of these people, and all of those people have got to work or they're bad people too. And so everybody's doing work and work and work. Here's something very interesting, and that is that the planet Earth would be just fine without humans. I mean, there would be trees and there would be flowers and there'd be plants and there'd be animals, and everybody's just okay the way things are. And then humans come by with that Christian work ethic, and the next thing you know, they're digging holes and cutting down trees and building stuff and making cement and polluting with automobiles. I mean, the human beings have not been kind to the planet Earth. In fact, they've given the planet Earth quite a rash because of working too hard. And not only that, but now the planet Earth is not doing so well, and neither are all the people because of all of this work. Got to get her done. Competition. And now we're going to give up that competition. We don't have to compete with anybody anymore. We're already okay. Everything is already all right. And so, Baba, you got something to say? No, I don't have anything to say. I just joined. How about you, Char? Go back to you.

**Speaker B:** I could read what Charles is saying. Oh, did he just leave? Oh no, he wrote something. He said, one thing that usually bothers me is having boss who force more overtime work or weird rules because they suffer, they must see you suffer too to be fine.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that, Ivan. Your microphone is not best for me. Mikey, what did Ivan just say?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

**Speaker F:** One thing that usually bothers me is having a boss whom forces more overtime work or weird rules because they suffer They must see you suffer too to be fine.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So if you've got an overbearing boss, one of the things that you can do— in fact, there are two things that you can do, and that is number one, become that boss's best friend. He probably doesn't have any friends at all at work. And so make him a best friend. Smile at him. Tell him he's doing a great job. He's got everything he needs. Keep pointing out to the boss that everything is all right. Now here's something that's very interesting. When somebody goes to get fired, the person who the boss is most likely to fire is the person he doesn't like. It may be the very best performer. He may fire somebody who knows Chinese and he really needs Chinese, but if he doesn't like the guy, He's going to fire him, even if it hurts the company. But the boss is probably not going to fire his best friend, even if the best friend is the worst performer. That's very interesting, you know, that the boss doesn't want to fire his best friend because he'll miss him when he's gone, and he knows that. So change your attitude about being the very best worker in the group because you're likely to get fired. In fact, they even have a system to where we do not want any indispensable employees. So if you become so good at your job that you're indispensable at the company, the big companies are going to fire you. So don't do a wonderful job. Be a really wonderful friend to the boss. That's the way to do it. Now, many of you might have to change your whole lifestyle, your whole attitude, because you've been trained to work and to work and to work and to be getting all your benefits from working while you're miserable at working. But at least I'm better than everybody else. I've been in that position myself. I was the very best there was at doing whatever I was doing. But I would always have contracts because I knew I wouldn't be able to manage a job for many, many years being the very best they had. So that's an important point. If you've got a boss that's overbearing, who's hard on you, become his friend. Let him take it easy. Say, 'Yes, boss, we're going to get that done.' Be happy with the boss. That takes training, by the way. You need to train. So if you've got a boss who's overbearing, then you need to get away from him, get away from it all, and start having happy, wholesome thoughts about that boss. 'Wow, he's a good friend. I'm going to make sure that he's a really good guy, and I'm going to be happy with him.' So let's see, Green Sage, what do you have to say?

**Speaker G:** Well, I didn't have too much to say before. I just came in late, but I really liked what you were just saying about befriending the boss. I agree that's probably a little bit more advanced. You probably want to be in a good place before you do that, but it was an interesting tactic. So I was just thinking about that. That was pretty interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's really hard to make a miserable boss happy when you're miserable with him.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, the only cost, I mean, obviously, if the person is— if what they're looking for to be happy is going to be really toxic or bad, then maybe stay away from it. But sometimes they're not too bad of a person and they're looking for, you know, maybe something, you know, companionship, or maybe they have a hobby that you like and actually You know, you can be friends with, uh, a lot of, uh, a-holes. You know, you can still be friends with them.

**Speaker A:** Yes, they're still a-holes, but you can be friends with them. Okay, Half Gay, what do you have to say? Go ahead, I'm listening. He's got his microphone on, but nothing's coming out.

**Speaker D:** I think he's got technical issues, maybe.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Krishnay? Nothing in particular to say, but thank you for the teaching. How about you, Andrew? Andrew?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, about being your boss's friend, I think that's really important. At my work, I'm really fortunate to know all my boss, like be friends with my boss and my boss's boss and the boss's boss's boss as well. I've known them for years, so it gives you a lot of freedom to just be yourself and enjoy yourself. And yeah, I'm a disability support worker. So in my job, like, I find that if I'm— if the Dharma is, you know, strong in me and I'm happy and joyful, I'm going to be a better worker. So it goes hand in hand. So yeah, for me, It really is important to make sure that you're joyful first and foremost.

**Speaker A:** Yes, glad to hear that. Congratulations.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So Mikey99, what do you have to say? Hello? Yes, go ahead. Um, better every day. That's really it.

**Speaker G:** Thank you for sharing this piece with.

**Speaker A:** Me and with all of us. All right, how about you, Oz? So what about you, Simon? You have any last things to say?

**Speaker B:** Yes, no need to work so hard.

**Speaker A:** I have enough. Yeah, no worries for the rest of your days. That's the song Ahuna Makata. Don't worry, everything is okay already. Life is easy when you take it easy. So anybody else have any last things to say before we finish the call? All right, Mikey, why don't you take it from here?

**Speaker G:** What would you like to Take it from wherever. Take what? Oh, I was about to say, I was like, I'm a newcomer.

**Speaker A:** Nice. I like that you were about to do it. That's good. I appreciate it. Yeah, that was excellent.

**Speaker F:** All right. Thank you, friends, for being here today. And yeah, glad to see so many new smiling faces.

So if you see her in this channel hanging out, you're welcome to join her and practice Anapanasati, maybe ask a question or two.

**Speaker A:** Yes, she's a very seasoned practitioner. She's been at it for years. She hung out with Goenka for many years, and she's also been a nun in Sri Lanka. And so I highly recommend that you talk with Anna, good friend. And in fact, that's what we're building here, is Sangha. Sangha means friendship in the Dharma, to have good friends, noble friends. So I recommend that you all work with Mikey on that. We also have a website. Tell them about the website, Mikey.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I can check out opensanghafoundation.org. We have a big map with a list of wats that you can go to if you'd like and check out. They like to offer free lunch and you can also make friends on there, send messages, write a blog post.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, thank you all for coming. This has been a nice group. We started out small, but now we've got, uh, what, uh, nearly 20 people on. I'm impressed. Thank you all. So we'll see you. Take care, everybody.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a group of Sangha friends, centers on transforming one's relationship with work and life by cultivating a foundational state of inner joy and satisfaction. Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: The Loss of Play**
- From childhood, society conditions us to replace natural **play and joy** with a **"work mentality"**—a sense of obligation, danger, and dissatisfaction.
- This leads to a lifelong pattern where we prioritize external duties over internal well-being, feeling subject to others' demands.

### **The Solution: The "Inside-Out" Approach**
The path is presented in two stages:
1.  **Fix the Inside First:** Develop a stable, joyful inner state through dedicated practice in **seclusion** (e.g., a quiet room).
2.  **Then Engage the Outside:** Bring that cultivated joy into daily life and interactions.

### **Core Practice: Cultivating Satisfaction (The End of Dukkha)**
- The Buddha's core teaching is the end of **dukkha** (suffering/dissatisfaction). The practice is to actively create its opposite: **satisfaction**.
- In seclusion, train yourself to reach a state where "everything is okay, everything is fine, I am safe and satisfied." This is the goal.

### **Practical Method: The "Wholesome Thought" Drill**
1.  **Gladden the Mind:** Use **wholesome thoughts** ("I am safe," "Everything is okay") to change your attitude and feeling.
2.  **Persist Against Old Habits:** Unwholesome, critical thoughts will arise (e.g., "This isn't enough"). This is the old conditioning.
3.  **Apply "Right Effort":** Like throwing mud on an adobe wall to make it stick, persistently and energetically reaffirm wholesome thoughts. **"Aha, I see you, Mara"**—acknowledge distracting thoughts without following them, then return to joy.
4.  **Build a New Habit:** This repetitive practice develops the **skill of satisfaction**, eventually leading to sustained joyful states like the **first jhana** (marked by absence of unwholesome states, joy, and focused attention).

### **Integrating Practice into Daily Life**
- Practice isn't just for long sits. **Seize "waiting" moments** (in line, at a bus stop) to relax and reaffirm joy.
- The ultimate aim is to **maintain this joyful state while active**. If an activity disrupts your joy, stop, regain your satisfaction, then resume.
- **Flip the priority:** Your feeling of well-being is more important than the task. Do things happily or not at all.

### **Applying the Attitude to Work & Relationships**
- **With Difficult People (e.g., a harsh boss):** Don't join their "pity party." Your best response is a compassionate smile. Strategically, try to **befriend them**; a boss is less likely to fire a friend, even if they're not the top performer.
- **The "OK Corral" Model:** For any action, you have two choices: **Do it** or **Don't do it**. Always choose from the **upper quadrant: feeling happy and satisfied**. Never operate from the lower quadrant (feeling bad).

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Life as a Monk's Ease:** Live as if your only job is to maintain a happy mind. The body should be relaxed, feelings joyful, attitude that of a "winner," and thoughts wholesome.
- **It's a Skill:** This is **training**, not abstract meditation. You are developing the skill of feeling good through systematic practice.
- **The Result:** Work and life become **play** when you approach them from an unshakable foundation of inner satisfaction. You realize, "I don't have to do anything to deserve this joy."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching of transforming work into play and cultivating a joyful, satisfied mind through Buddhist practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "One-Two Punch" / "Inside-Outside" Metaphor:** The speaker frames the spiritual path as a "one-two situation, a one-two punch." The first step ("the inside") is to fix your internal system—cultivate satisfaction and joy in seclusion. The second step ("the outside") is to then take that cultivated state out into the world.

2.  **The Adobe House:** This is the most detailed metaphor, used to explain how to make wholesome thoughts "stick" and replace old, unhappy mental habits.
    *   **Old Habits = A bare frame.** The mind's existing structure.
    *   **Wholesome Thoughts = Mud/Adobe.** The new, positive material.
    *   **Right Effort = Throwing the mud with force.** You can't just gently place positive thoughts; you must apply energetic, repeated intention ("throw it on") so they adhere and fill in the cracks, eventually building a habitable, joyful mind.

3.  **The "OK Corral" Quadrant:** Adapted from Eric Berne's model, this is a decision-making framework.
    *   **Horizontal Axis:** *Do the job* (left) vs. *Don't do the job* (right).
    *   **Vertical Axis:** *Feel bad* (lower) vs. *Feel good/happy* (upper).
    The goal is to operate **only in the top half**—whether you choose to act or not, you maintain the joyful, "everything is okay" state. This "changes everything upside down" from the societal norm of working even when miserable (lower left quadrant).

4.  **"Aha, I See You, Mara!":** This is a direct reference to a story about the Buddha. **Mara** is the personification of distraction, doubt, and unwholesome states. The metaphor is to personify distracting or negative thoughts as "Mara" popping up. By mindfully noting, "Aha, I see you," you disarm them and return to a wholesome state without getting caught in the content of the thought.

5.  **Performance on Stage:** Referencing the advice of Achan Puang, the speaker suggests practicing self-observation **"as if other people are there, other people are watching you."** This metaphor encourages bringing intense, focused attention to your inner state, as if you were performing mindfulness for an audience, which sharpens awareness.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Childhood and School:** The talk opens with a narrative about how society trains people out of play. Children are "grabbed and put into school," taught that work (learning ABCs, etc.) is serious and dangerous to neglect. This creates a "work mentality" that causes people to "give up our freedom and our joy," a story presented as a near-universal experience.

2.  **The Meditation Retreat Timeline:** The speaker tells a common story about the typical meditator's experience on retreat:
    *   **Beginning:** Thinking about the past (how they got there).
    *   **Middle:** Seeing the present clearly and not liking it.
    *   **End:** Eager to leave, planning the future.
    This story illustrates how people often waste the opportunity to be present because they are conditioned toward dissatisfaction.

3.  **The Boss Anecdote:** In response to a participant's comment about an overbearing boss, the speaker offers a strategic story/reframe. Instead of being the best performer (who might be fired for being "indispensable" or disliked), the advice is to **become the boss's best friend**. The implied story is that a boss will keep a friendly, joyful employee around even if they aren't the top performer, because friendship and harmony are valued. This applies the core teaching (maintain joy) to a practical workplace dilemma.

4.  **Contrasting Monastery Lifestyles:** The speaker briefly contrasts the scheduled, labor-intensive life of a **Christian monastery** (pray, work, pray on a strict schedule) with the easygoing, joy-focused life of a **Buddhist monastery**. This story is used to model the ideal: living as if you have "no place to go and nothing to do," where your only "job" is to maintain a happy mind.

### **Overall Narrative Arc**
The talk itself follows a **metaphorical journey**:
*   **The Problem (The Old Story):** We are exiled from the "play" of childhood into the "work" of adulthood, becoming conditioned to dissatisfaction.
*   **The Path (The New Training):** We go into the "seclusion" of our own mind (the "empty hut") to deconstruct the old story and, through diligent "skill development" (like building an adobe house), construct a new baseline of satisfaction.
*   **The Application (The Playful Return):** We re-enter the world with our newfound joy, using frameworks like the "OK Corral" to interact without being pulled back into the old story of suffering, even transforming difficult situations (like dealing with a bad boss) into part of the play.

These metaphors and stories work together to make the abstract principles of Buddhist practice (overcoming *dukkha*, cultivating *sati* and *samma vayama*) concrete, relatable, and actionable.
