### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I suddenly like think like, okay, maybe it's not right for me this way. Maybe I have to change something. Maybe I have to give up my school here and do something else. Maybe I should move into a community, you know, all kinds of thoughts. And usually after 3, 4 days, I start again, because I'm refreshed, I'm more— I slept more and so on, and so maybe I start again and I go back to school. But—.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's a question for you. Yeah, here's a question for you. Why do you wait 3 or 4 or 5 days before you start looking at your thoughts to see how unwholesome they are. If you said that you'd been practicing, now you're telling me that you're not.

**Speaker A:** Well, I am, but like, this is— it's like, uh, It's almost out of control. I mean, independent.

**Speaker B:** No, they're not out of control. That's just another unwholesome thought. I see you. That's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** So should I just keep going and trying to throw some morals on thoughts. I try to not stop.

**Speaker B:** Actually, the correct word that I would use is to remember to look.

**Speaker A:** To.

**Speaker B:** Remember to look at your thoughts. Practice every day to remember to look at your thoughts so that you can start to have wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Instead of letting those thoughts just run wild, saying that they're out of control, which is just another unwholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I, I thought I've done that, but you know It happens anyway, so like, yeah, probably more, more deep. I wanted to think— Maybe I'm uncovering stuff.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Oh, maybe I'm uncovering stuff, more deep stuff, I don't know, something like that.

**Speaker B:** And— There is nothing deep, everything is right there on the surface, and it happens over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, why it looks like it's so cyclical? Like, maybe I, I think like I'm, I'm doing practice, sustained practice during the day, and I, I feel like, okay, like this is quite like almost for Jhana, like I'm, I keep up the good thoughts and so on. And suddenly after some time I completely shut down, you know, it's like, yeah, okay, it becomes really physical, it becomes really physical, you know.

**Speaker B:** No, it's not physical, it's mental. And the shutting down is mental.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And when you do shut down, can you see that you're shutting down and say, hey, I don't have to do that, I can still watch? So really is what's happened is, is that after all of this time, you've actually started to change the practice rather than keeping it correct. Because you said things like that, you've let it go 4 or 5 days, 3 or 4 days being down instead of catching that after 3 or 4 minutes, or maybe even 3 or 4 seconds. You can catch that stuff and say, hey, I can do better than this. I can have more wholesome thoughts than this. Yeah, and this is why we recommend that you practice not just once a day but throughout the day. That I would go so far as to say start— and you can do this with an alarm on your phone to let the alarm go off once an hour. And every time the alarm goes off, you can say, all right, now's the time to remember to have good wholesome thoughts. And then you start practicing looking, because if you did that, then you would interrupt that stuff before it goes for 3, 4, 5 days. Start interrupting it. So this is what I recommend. That you start practicing often.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah. 10 minutes more times a day. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, practicing having thoughts of, I can do this, I can be kind to my friends, I can put a smile on my face. I can do this. I don't have to be a victim of these unwholesome thoughts, thinking that they're powerful. Those are just victim thoughts. Having winner's thoughts like, I can do this, those thoughts can't manage my life, I'm going to do that according to wisdom.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you. That helps.

**Speaker B:** Now don't feel bad because I'm saying this, but basically it happens to everyone. When people stop calling and stop reinforcing and stop having good noble friends, we begin to take on the habits of the people who are around us. You begin to be what your environment presents to you. And so this is why I would recommend, Pedro, is that you get back into it. And in fact, I've got a good friend for you. His name is Jesus. He's, I think, Spanish.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, I remember Jesus. Yes, Jesus.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right. So Get in touch with him, start having conversations with him. He also has a lot of knowledge about what's in places in Italy. He knows all of what's going on in Europe.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes.

**Speaker B:** So while you've been going to school and feeling bad, he's been Wad hopping. Oh gosh.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, definitely have to come back in the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Yes, come back into the Sangha. Start having some noble friends.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, like I went, went with my mind, you know, and say, okay, now time to to try to be on your own and try to see what you can accomplish alone and so on. But definitely after one year and a half, I've maybe lost a bit of, you know, adherence to the principle of the Dharma. So maybe I twisted into my way.

**Speaker B:** Yes, come back, come back and start having noble friendships. Come back and start thinking about and talking about the Dharma, to remember the Dharma, to remember you don't have to go deep in your own old crap. That's just an old bad habit. And when I see— when I use the word deep, perhaps a better word would be often.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so we're not going to go deep, we're going to go often.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, yeah. So please, uh, if you can send me the links to the group so that I can join. Now maybe I can find that online. No, no problem.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, there it's all online. Uh, go to any of the YouTubes. Yes, because you, you know our YouTube channel.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And every one of the new— yeah, the newest ones have the most, uh, up-to-date links.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And we have the Sangha Group, uh, UK, and the Sangha Group US, and, and an active Discord.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And some other groups. Now we also have a working website now.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I visited like last month, I believe, out of curiosity. Last month, yeah, I think I've seen the website. I believe I have to check it out.

**Speaker B:** There's too many people involved.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I will check it out. Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So that would be the first thing that I would recommend is get back in the flow, get back into the Dhamma saddle again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, we— best for me. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Maybe listening to some videos.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Yes, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now there's one, there's one thing about it, and that is, is that.

**Speaker A:** Um.

**Speaker B:** Of all the very, very many millions and millions of people who have heard the teachings of the Buddha Most of them don't practice, and those who do practice, most of them practice wrongly. And so that leaves those who are practicing correctly in a very small minority. And in that small minority, those who are practicing correctly get great benefit. Great fruit. And that in fact, they begin to get the great fruits so that they can, because they see how valuable it is, they want to practice more. But over time, if you don't have any friends and you don't hear any Dhamma, then we can get reabsorbed into society. Back into school, back into the other students. And those other students, there's not very many wise sages in that group.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** And so coming back to the Sangha would be the right thing to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes.

**Speaker B:** Come be in that very small minority. Very few people actually practice well enough to be happy. Everybody's chasing happiness, but they're chasing it in the wrong way. Why? Because they listen to the people in society who are chasing happiness in the wrong way. Or as the song says, looking for love in all the wrong places. Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Instead of within your own mind, that's where happiness will be. But you have to actually change the unhappiness to happiness. You have to change all of those unsatisfying thoughts into satisfying thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Change those fearful thoughts into, um, Thoughts of safety and security. Change all those uncomfortable thoughts to comfortable thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Thoughts like, oh, this is hard to do, into I can do this. Okay, I can be happy, I can do it. What a relief it is. You can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you, Dhammarato. I needed this refreshment. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** I know everyone needs it. Everybody needs to keep coming back to the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** So you get in touch with, uh, uh, Jesus.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Tell him your situation. Get him to advise you because he's been in the Dharma all of this time. He's been at Amravati. He's been at, uh, a wat in Portugal. He's been in wats in, uh, uh, Italy, I think.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, yes. Okay, thank you that much.

**Speaker B:** Let me see you on the groups too. All right, start posting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I will, I will.

**Speaker B:** Say something like, wow, it's been a long time and I'm really glad to be back here again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because we got a lot of old friends that you'll remember.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** So are you going to start practicing?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I will, Dhammarato, I will.

**Speaker B:** All right, so you start practicing and then give me a call. Okay, call me next week.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Thank you again, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker B:** And I'm really happy to see you again at long last. It's been quite a while.

**Speaker A:** The same for me. Thank you, Dhammarato. Bye.

**Speaker B:** All right. Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a practitioner (Speaker A, likely Pedro) who has fallen away from consistent practice and is struggling with cyclical periods of doubt, exhaustion, and unwholesome thoughts.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**The Problem:**
*   The practitioner describes a pattern of intense practice followed by a complete mental and physical "shut down," leading to several days of demotivation, thoughts of quitting school, and questioning his path.
*   He feels his thoughts are "out of control" and wonders if he is "uncovering deep stuff."

**Dhammarato's Diagnosis & Correction:**
1.  **Thoughts Are Not "Deep" or "Out of Control":** Dhammarato corrects this view, stating these are just repeated, surface-level **unwholesome thoughts**. Labeling them as "out of control" or "deep" is itself an unwholesome, disempowering thought.
2.  **The Core Practice is "Remembering to Look":** The essential practice is to constantly **observe one's thoughts** to identify them as wholesome or unwholesome, not to let them run unchecked for days.
3.  **Interrupt the Cycle Frequently:** Instead of allowing negative cycles to last for days, the goal is to catch them within **seconds or minutes**. He recommends setting an hourly alarm as a reminder to "remember to have good wholesome thoughts."
4.  **Replace, Don't Just Suppress:** Actively replace unwholesome thoughts (e.g., "This is too hard," "I can't") with **wholesome, empowering thoughts** (e.g., "I can do this," "I can be kind," "I am not a victim of these thoughts").
5.  **The Critical Role of Noble Friendship (Sangha):** Dhammarato identifies the root cause: the practitioner has isolated himself from the **Sangha (spiritual community)**. Without the support and reinforcement of "noble friends," one easily reverts to the habits of conventional society. He strongly urges a return to the community.
6.  **Practice Correctly and Often:** He emphasizes that very few people practice correctly and consistently. To gain the "great fruit" of the Dhamma, one must practice **correctly and often**, not just intensely and then burn out.

**The Prescribed Solution:**
1.  **Re-engage with the Sangha immediately:** Join the online groups (Discord, etc.), listen to talks, and start participating again.
2.  **Connect with a specific noble friend ("Jesus")** for guidance and support.
3.  **Restart frequent, correct practice:** Use hourly reminders to observe and cultivate wholesome thoughts throughout the day.
4.  **Follow up:** Commit to checking in the following week to report on progress.

**Overall Theme:** The talk is a compassionate but direct intervention against spiritual isolation and slackening practice. It stresses that the path to happiness is found not in sporadic, intense introspection but through **constant, mindful course-correction of thoughts**, powerfully supported by **consistent practice and spiritual friendship**.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories are:

**1. The "Wild" or "Runaway" Thoughts Metaphor:**  
Speaker B repeatedly describes unwholesome thoughts as something that can *"run wild"* or are *"out of control,"* like untamed animals. The advice is to *"look at your thoughts"* rather than letting them roam unchecked.

**2. The Victim vs. Winner Metaphor:**  
Speaker B contrasts *"victim thoughts"* (e.g., "I can’t control this") with *"winner's thoughts"* (e.g., "I can do this"). This frames the mental struggle as a choice between being a passive victim or an active agent.

**3. The "Deep" vs. "Often" Re-framing:**  
When Speaker A mentions *"uncovering deep stuff,"* Speaker B corrects this, saying *"There is nothing deep, everything is right there on the surface"* and replaces *"deep"* with *"often."* This shifts the focus from digging into hidden psychological layers to repeatedly observing surface patterns.

**4. The Cyclical Shutdown / Wave Metaphor:**  
Speaker A describes a cycle of practice followed by a *"shut down"* that feels *"really physical."* Speaker B reinterprets this as a mental, not physical, cycle—implying a recurring wave of unwholesome habits that can be interrupted.

**5. The Alarm Clock / Interruption Tool:**  
Speaker B suggests setting an alarm hourly to *"remember to have good wholesome thoughts."* This turns practice into a regular, scheduled interruption of negative thought cycles.

**6. The Environmental Absorption Story:**  
Speaker B explains that when people stop engaging with noble friends and the Dharma, they *"begin to take on the habits of the people around"* and *"be what your environment presents."* This is a story of how one’s social environment shapes mental habits.

**7. The "Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places" Cultural Reference:**  
Speaker B quotes the famous song lyric to illustrate that most people seek happiness externally (in society, school, etc.) instead of internally through mental training.

**8. The Saddle Metaphor:**  
Speaker B advises *"get back in the Dhamma saddle again,"* evoking the image of riding a horse—suggesting a return to an active, controlled, directed practice.

**9. The Small Minority / Rare Practitioner Story:**  
Speaker B describes practitioners who practice correctly as a *"very small minority"* who *"get great fruit."* This story encourages returning to the Sangha to be part of that dedicated group.

**10. The Friend (Jesus) as a Guide Story:**  
The mention of Jesus—a knowledgeable friend who has been to various monasteries—serves as a concrete example of a *"noble friend"* who can help Speaker A reconnect with the Dharma community.

These metaphors and stories collectively frame the Dharma practice as:
- **A training in thought management** (taming, interrupting, choosing thoughts).
- **A social endeavor** (needing noble friends, avoiding negative environmental influences).
- **A simple, surface-level, frequent activity**—not a deep, introspective excavation.
- **A return to a guided path** after straying into self-reliance.
