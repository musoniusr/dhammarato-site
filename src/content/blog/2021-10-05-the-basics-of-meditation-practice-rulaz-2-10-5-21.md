### Transcript


**Speaker A:** The first thing that we can talk about is that we need to do some things in stages.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that's kind of hard to do when life is kind of all in a mix. All right, it's sort of like the difference between the ingredients that's going into baking a cake or baking bread versus the ingredients after they're already mixed together.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right.

**Speaker A:** So your life is already a great big mix of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** What we need to do is to start doing some separations. Okay, this is what the actual practice of meditation is for, is to get some separation. Once, uh, let us say that we came into the world ignorantly and innocently as babies, as children, and living in that society, we depended upon that society, that no tender infant can survive without family, and that family grows into all of society very quickly, within a few years. And so we become dependent upon society, and we're in it. And there are some major problems with society, just like some major benefits, and we buy into both sides of that. Okay, well, one of the ways that we're looking at it now is let's get out of society and clean it out and start over again. Then we can come back into the world having learned from our mistakes, having a fresh new look at things, and also with a completely different attitude than a baby. Children are dependent, it's built in. You as an adult are not dependent, but we don't recognize that because we haven't grown up yet. Once we go off into seclusion and get the mind straightened out, then we can come back into society and not buy into the crap, but use wisdom instead of feelings. All right, now, uh, that's traditionally the way that the Buddha has taught. That's the way of practice and all of that kind of stuff. But it— and in fact, you could say that throughout traditional Asian history, that was easy enough to do. But in Western society, the society itself has grabbed you, owned you, told you things that you now believe are true and that those things that you believe are true because you got them from society are now going to be problematic for you to get away from that society. See, every young man in Thailand has the opportunity, not only the opportunity but a lot of family pressure, to go and join the Sangha, to go and live in the wat, to get away from the society. In America and in some places in Mexico, very few, there are wats, and that tradition is just beginning to get grounded and started in the West. But it is in its bare infancy now, in the sense that almost none of the students of modern meditation practices have the opportunity to say, well, Quit your job, get on an airplane, go to Asia, and go live in a temple. Why not? Not a big deal. The answer to that is the Americans, the Mexicans, all of the people in Western culture think that it not only is a big deal, but it's too big a deal. Not only that, but those who do see it as an opportunity rather than a big deal, when they come to Asia, then they have to struggle with a whole lot of stuff that they didn't know about because they hadn't been here before, in the sense that it's not just the Dharma that you come from, but it's also Asian cuisine, Asian culture, Asian language, Asian ways of doing things, and that the Asians are also kind of used to having Westerners come in who don't understand Asian culture, and the Asians look down on Westerners. Sometimes with very good reasons. So Asians don't even give the Westerners much of a chance of learning the Dharma. And so there's a whole lot of struggles that we have to put up with in this. And the correct way of practicing then is to practice your meditation with the understanding and the intention of being away from everything else, especially the way that you think and the way that you have done things. The way you go to sleep at night, the way you wake up in the morning has now all got to be part of the society that you're putting aside and starting off again fresh. This is why the Buddha recommends going to the woods, to the foot of a tree, to an empty hut, to a heap of straw, find someplace that's comfortable, and hang out for a while. Let the mind settle down. This is actually what they try to do in a retreat, but they don't— let us say the retreats are too intense the way that they're operated. Rather than allowing people to just retreat in the sense of getting away from the world, Now they've got a whole lot of stuff to do called a meditation retreat, right? And so that too is kind of problematic of moving out of doing this into doing that. And what we really need to look at for you is the understanding of at least for a few times a day for about 10 minutes you're going to get out of doing this and to not do that, but rather not do much of anything at all. Okay, okay, that we're going to practice not doing a bunch of stuff, especially the not doing that's in the mind. This is what we call the hindrances, is the doing of the world that we take with us. All right, we want to stop doing all of that stuff. And what we're going to do instead, the little bit of doing, is to be here now. Now, a lot of people, when they've heard about that from Buddhism, they think it's a great big whoop-de-doo deal. It's hard to be in the here now. Really, that's not true at all. That's the easy part. The hard part is to stop doing. Is to put on the brakes and start listening to the mind and recognize we don't have to do that right now. We can pay attention to what's going on right now instead. This is the beginning of the practice of Anapanasati. And the Buddha has a story about it. He calls it— or actually I call it in English for easy reference so that students will understand it— we call it the log in the bog.

**Speaker B:** Log in the bog.

**Speaker A:** A log in the bog is a tree that has fallen over in the swamp. Okay, now there's certain kinds of trees that live in swamps, so we're not talking about a giant oak in the swamp. We're talking about the kind of log, a cypress or something, the kind of tree that would be in the bog. Now, in the Buddhist time, there were professional fire starters. Getting fires started was not the easiest thing, and so they developed an entire profession out of it, and eventually a religion. But the professional fire starters were actually very good at rubbing sticks and things like that together. They had all the right equipment to make a fire fairly easy for themselves. So the question is, can a fire maker, professional fire maker, come to that log in the bog and set it on fire?

**Speaker B:** Well, he's a professional.

**Speaker A:** He's a professional fire maker. Can he set that log on fire? Now, he doesn't have the modern tools like acetylene torches. Well, he does, but he does have his tools. But the point is, is that no, he cannot set that log on fire because it's saturated, soaking in water. That in fact, over time, those logs go deeper and deeper as the water completely fills them up, to the point that some of those logs either sink completely or ride on the surface just so an inch or two of the log is above the surface of the water because it's so completely saturated with water now that it's waterlogged. Basically, that's how that term comes out, okay? Logs get waterlogged and become— and then they sink. So you cannot start that log on fire. But if you grab that log and hoist it out and pull it out onto the dry land, now can the log be set on fire.

**Speaker B:** After a while, after it dries.

**Speaker A:** So the answer is not when you bring it out of the water, because it's still completely waterlogged. But you can lay it there in, uh, on the land so that the gravity will pull the water down and the sun will shine and bake it, and some of the top of the log will evaporate, and the rest of the water log will go down, so that there eventually will come a time that even when the log is almost completely saturated with water, still there's enough of the log that's dry now that you can set that on fire. This is in fact how the ancients made dugout canoes. To make it easy, that's exactly how they did it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** They would use fire on the part of the log that was not saturated with water, and then they would dig it right out, dig the ash out, and they've got a canoe. So, this point that we're making is also very much like the mind, that we are saturated in the bog of society, so saturated in fact we don't even know that we're completely saturated in it. And so getting the human, getting the body, getting the mind out of society is beneficial. Now what's happening with you and with most of the students and people who work for a living and all of that are practicing meditation. They come out onto the beach for maybe 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 minutes, maybe an hour, And then they jump right back in the bog. Then they come out for a little bit, then they jump right back in. Okay, so we need to find a way of making the time that you're out of the bog most beneficial for you so that you can get benefit out of it. Okay, so that then when you go back into the bog completely hollowed out, now you will float on top of the water and not be drowned under it. Okay, this is what we mean by the supramundane.

**Speaker B:** So the supramundane would mean being above

**Speaker A:** the world, or above the bog, above the swamp.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Now we have the analogy, and this is quite prominent in Washington, D.C., but it seems to have gotten all over the place, and that is the idea of going to drain the swamp, with the idea that the swamp draining guy has gone to Washington, D.C. to help fix the place, and he's now in the in this photo of a man in the swamp surrounded by alligators. And the caption under that is that when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp. Right? Well, this is what society is all about. Everyone goes to Washington, all of the pages, all of the assistants, the employees, the politicians, they all go to Washington with the idea that they're going to fix things that are broken. Very soon they wind up getting stuck in the bog up to their hips in alligators, and after a while some of them actually become alligators. If you can understand it like that, you can understand then that ordinary people, when we get— when we go into a, let us say, a task like a job, like a protest or a movement or something like that, that the individuals often get swallowed up in the bog that they're making. And it's best for us to stay out of those kinds of bogs and stay high and dry.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or at least get high and dry so that we can then float on top of the bog if we have to go back in it. As in Christianity, they have Jesus to say, "To be in the world but not of the world." This is an example of what we're talking about there, is that you actually have to get out of the world to dry out, hollow out, and then you can go back into the world, be on top of the world. Dukkha, okay. But unfortunately, you're not going to give yourself that option. You're going to give yourself the option of going back into the water, back into the bog, over and over and over again, even though you're really not ready. Okay, okay. But you can practice that. With that knowledge and understanding. But the first thing that we need to do is for a while to get the idea of coming out of the bog, to come out over and over again, sometimes several times a day. So the style that we're going to use, rather than all meditation all the time for a short period of time, we're going to have meditation interspersed throughout the day to give you an opportunity to get out often, to get out of the bog, to get out of the bog over and over and over again. Okay, okay. And so when we talked before, I talked about when you wake up in the morning and as you're going to sleep at night, but I'm actually putting that in the reference of only 2 opportunities of several that you will have throughout the day. Now, for you, you'll have to figure out what those are, but I would recommend that the students actually start putting in about an hour a day. Put some skin in the game, put some time into this. However, sitting all at one time for an hour is not recommended for several reasons. One is that the human attention span It's not an hour, it's normally only about 20 minutes. And number 2, the body is not used to sitting in postures for long periods of time. And so breaking it up and having shorter sittings more often has other benefits in the sense that if you have that old repeating mental habit pattern that you're using throughout the day, And now, 6 times a day, you're interrupting that pattern and putting a new pattern in. And that means that that stuff will become part of the memory, and at other times you'll remember it when you need it. And so we're looking at the way of linking it all together. So instead of just leaving the world, getting high and dry, all hollowed out, everything is good, hunky-dory, and then we can either sit high and dry or go for a cruise. Either way, that's one path, but that's not a path for the Westerners because the Westerners have the job, they have the school, they have the mommy and the daddy's pressure, they have the society's pressure and all of that kind of stuff. And part of that pressure has to do with a certain kind of vocabulary that's intended to belittle or downgrade people who are actually acting in a much more wise, wholesome way in their life. Wise, wholesome people are often called layabouts, lazy.

**Speaker B:** Well, because they don't act in the norms of the society, like I think I, like, I would take it chill instead of acting like it's like all, I need to work, I need to do this, I need to do this and that. So I'm just like, it's okay, there's no rush.

**Speaker A:** So what we're going to do now is practice about 6 times a day to actually chill out.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And And would that be like sitting down?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yes, we can work on that. Um, that in fact we can do that, uh, but it's a little bit more of an advanced activity what I'm thinking about now, in the sense of every time that you sit down in a chair should be an opportunity for you to chill out.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Every time that you sit down, but there may be times when you don't, and then you'll feel bad. So, but you can remember to take the opportunity that sometimes when you sit down in a chair, instead of sitting down to work, you can sit down to do nothing for 5 minutes and just enjoy the fact that you're sitting with no place to go and nothing to do, and the boss is not calling, and there's no alligators on the floor, and everything is hunky-dory for 5 minutes, and I don't even have to think about that email. I don't have to think about that job that I've got to do. I could just be happy and hang out and watch my breath. Okay, here we're going to start having wholesome thoughts. And one of the unwholesome thoughts would be, you ought to be meditating. That's an unwholesome thought. A much better way of thinking of it is, is that, yeah, this is a good time to meditate. I could just sit down and relax.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** yeah, and just sit down and relax. Oh, I can just sit down and relax. I don't have to think about all the troubles of the world. I can, I can get dry from that. I can get out of that bog for a little while and get myself chilled out just a little. We keep practicing that over and over and over again, and it begins to link throughout the day so that the students begin to remember over and over and over again to take a deep breath and just to chill.

**Speaker B:** Hello, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, uh, this chilling out process has the quality of removing unwholesome thoughts. Now the Buddha talks about it in the sense of Kilesa and Kusala rather, and Ekusala. The word Kusala actually is a word that comes from— it's actually a part of India as a location, but original term was that it was a kind of a grass, but it was a heavy, heavy-duty grass. It was so heavy that the big leaves were heavy and thorny, and that you could drive the leaf out of this kasala grass and then use the leaf itself, dried out and pressed down under a rock, as a knife. And it would cut all kinds of things. Cut your skin for sure. Cut bread. It wasn't strong enough to cut wood. But kusala-grass has historically been like humanity's first knife, because it was easy. And what we mean by that is the kusala, or ekusala, means, "Will this knife cut?" "Will this dog hunt?" "Do you have skin in the game?" That's the question when we talk about kusala versus ekusala. So ekusala means that we can't cut into this. We can't see it. It's unwholesome. But when it's, when it's kusala, that means that we can look into it, we can see it. It becomes wholesome, it becomes useful and valuable. Oh, we're going to start looking at thoughts as to whether they're wholesome or unwholesome, or whether we can see directly into them or not.

**Speaker B:** By seeing directly into them, see the wholesomeness.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now this is a skill to be developed. This is not something that I give you an idea and you've got an insight and all of a sudden you've got a full-blown skill going. No, this is going to take some time to develop that skill. And that skill means is that things that you were doing, you now see are unwholesome. Now normally people will be very slow to do that because they don't like the fact that we screw up. We're not supposed to screw up. But here we're going to be actively engaged, happily engaged, with watching the mind go into unwholesome states so that we can catch it doing that, because otherwise we're just going to stay stuck in all of those unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We're going to start looking at them and that we can— we're going to start looking at ekusala and kusala in the following way to get you to understand what we're talking about. If you have a thought about something that is not here, then you're having a thought about something that does not exist right here, right now. Okay. Isn't that interesting? So if we're having thoughts of the past, we're not here, we're not present. If we have thoughts about work that has to be done into the future, we're not here, we're not present. So for the beginner, we can begin to understand that any kind of thoughts that are about the past or any kind of thoughts that are about the future are also— we can have any thoughts that are about things that are not happening right here in front of us, right here in this world, but in fact they're in some off unknown world, say Washington, D.C. or the other side of Mexico. Okay, what's up? The Yucatan, thoughts of the border, thoughts of other places is actually delusional thinking. Now humans don't like to call that delusional thinking, and so we build other of words around it. We call it conceptual thinking. We're conceptualizing, we've got a concept here, all right? And so we begin to look at the distinction between observing what is real and thinking about what's real versus concocting or dragging up memories from the past or having conceptualized thought. So conceptualized thinking is in fact a way of understanding what we mean by wholesome versus unwholesome. Another way of looking at it is in the sense of thoughts that are judgmental, or thoughts that are critical. Thoughts that are critical in the sense of, "This is good, this is better, I like this, I don't like that," In fact, critical thinking is the entire basis of the Second Noble Truth: the cause of suffering is critical thinking. I like that and I want it, and I want more of it, or I don't like that and I've got to stomp it out with a hammer. Right? This is all the doing of the world. The doing of the world is all based upon critical thinking. But in fact, humanity is so messed up that they even think that critical thinking is a good thing to do. They advertise it in school. Oh, you've got to think critically. I would rather them say you got to think wisely, because critical actually means criticism, going around finding fault, judgments, and all of that. Now, this is what we're talking about now, this concept of right and wrong, good and bad, this is good, this is better, that's best, all of this comparison, critical thinking, the dangers of it have been known for many, many centuries, that in fact this is what we're talking about actually is the story of Adam and Eve. It's that old. What is the story of Adam and Eve? Many Christians, they get wrapped up in the story rather than the moral of the story, or the outcome of it. And so they get into talking snakes and apples and, uh, fig leaves and, uh, who did it first and, um, all of that kind of stuff. But there really is a teaching in there, and that is, is that Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of knowledge of good and evil, right? That's the, that's the little phrase. Eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil means that the eating of the fruit means that they had to put up with the results of their actions. Had to put up with something that they did. What did they do? They gained knowledge of good and evil, which meant they went around paradise saying, I like that, but that tree's got to come out. You know, I live in paradise here. There's a really beautiful sing tree here, but it's got yellow leaves on it today, and I don't like that. And so I'm going to take that tree up. I'm going to dig it up and throw it out because I want only in my paradise to have green leaves. No yellow leaves allowed. All right, with that kind of attitude, how long will there be trees in this paradise? It will eventually be all Anagami. Exactly. This is what we mean by paving paradise and putting up a parking lot is that we keep throwing things out because we've judged them to be bad. And by doing so, we have destroyed the very paradise that we live in. You actually live in a paradise, but you don't know it because you go around judging it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's what we mean by critical thinking. The worst part of it is, is that you also judgmental or critical of yourself. Part of the reason why you called me is because you want things to be better. Yeah, yeah. Guess what? Maybe they won't be, but you can be happy anyway. Maybe they won't be any different than they are now, but what can change is your attitude about things. So that you can begin to see it as a paradise. Where you are right here, right now, this is a paradise. But when we are leaving paradise in order to go into the past, when we're leaving this paradise in order to go someplace else, when we leave this paradise in order to go off into the future, we're not really living in the real world. We're not being here now. So this is one of the ways of looking at it, in the sense of what is wholesome and what is not wholesome, is whether the thoughts are critical or whether they're nurturing. Because there's another way of talking about it, and that is to let everything be okay, to nurture. That in fact, when a new baby is born, It will not survive unless it's nurtured. But almost always, it doesn't happen 100% of the time, but most of the time, mom will get her baby and she will nourish it and nurture it and take care of it. And that feeling of nurturing and taking care of that mom has for that infant keeps that infant alive and well. But it doesn't last for long. Actually, it seems to last about 4, 5, or 6 years at the best, and then mom becomes critical of that child, and now the child is living with criticism for the rest of his life, and he longs for and misses the original nurturing that he had when he was a tender infant. And nobody ever bothered to tell that guy that he can nurture himself. This is what we again mean by wholesome thoughts, is to begin to nurture ourselves in the paradise that we are currently in, in this moment, and coming out of the critical thinking. Okay, okay, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Like today I was, I was taking a walk. Like, this has been on my mind for quite a while. Since the last time we spoke, really, actually. So, it's like, like I go walking and, like I've always had this feeling that life is like, really just like a, like a beep, you know, like boom. So—

**Speaker A:** This moment certainly is, followed by another boom, followed by another boom. Some people call it like foam with little bubbles just popping one at a time. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. The Buddha talks about it like, and that is one by one as they occur, new moment, this new moment, everything is new. Anyway, yes, life is like that.

**Speaker B:** But now I was walking and I was like, well, yeah, it's like Like, I don't know if it's going fast or it's going slow. Like, like I'm right here right now and I like it. So I like, I call that a wholesome thought. So I feel like, yeah, and it cheers me up and I feel like, okay, and I feel like, like warmed up, like if, like if I had some blanket on and I'm like, yeah, let's go. And And yeah, but like, I would like to have some ground to actually recognize whole and unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's going to take some investigation on your part. Okay, but it sounds to me like the kind of thoughts that you have that allow yourself to feel warm and gushy and all chilled out, those are wholesome thoughts. Okay, you can recognize that as wholesome thoughts. Now, in, um, in various suttas, the Buddha talks about this stuff in various ways. But it seems like Western Buddhism for some reason didn't get it. In one way, the Buddha talks about it as obstructions. As a lot of people don't understand obstructions as obstructions, because we get some gratification or delight out of it, we cannot see the dangers in it. Another way that the Buddha talks about it is in the sense of hindrances, and in this regard he's talking about the hindrances that are in this moment hindering you from being in a really warm, gooey state. Another way of mentioning it is like the way that we've been talking about kusala and akusala, wholesome and unwholesome. But in the Anapanasati Sutra, the Buddha uses a specific kind of language here, in the sense that step 10 of Anapanasati— these are not actual steps like marching steps, up 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8— but rather just in order of appearance, in the sense of the listing of on a piece of paper just to understand it. It's Step 10, but basically it's one of the first things that we need to do, and that is to gladden the mind. Gladden the mind, or to brighten the mind, to literally pick it up out of the garbage, or to take it out of the bog and put it up on the the ground, the brightening of the mind, the lifting of the mind, the gladdening of the mind, and this is done with gladdening thoughts. And that the Buddha actually had one as an example that's quite famous in the teaching. This is actually, you could say that this one phrase that I'm about to say was the linchpin that put the entire package together for the Buddha so that he could understand things correctly. In the sense of the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, and all of that. And that is the phrase, aha, I see you, Mara. Okay, aha, I see you, what's in the mind. I can see you as Mara. Now let's define Mara for just a bit because there's many different definitions, but they're all kind of pointing in the same direction. Sometimes the word Mara is used for the word world in the sense of society, not in the sense of planet Earth. Yeah, it can also be thought of as devil. Can also be thought of as the mind, but in the way that we're looking at it right here is, is that it can also be referring to unwholesome thoughts. Are devil thoughts, are thoughts that hinder us from being in the good state. But when we say, aha, I see you, that means that we're separating ourselves from those unwholesome thoughts that we were stuck in. Aha, I see you is the very dragging the log out of the bog.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The bog is not the owner of the log, nor is the log owning the bog. We can come out of it. Aha, I see you, Mara. I can see what you're doing, Mr. Mind. I recognize that thought. I can see it. Now we can look at it this way. Notice that my hand is going around and around. This is the world, this is the spinning, and this is the mind in the sense of taking a journey with that. But then the Sati comes, the wake-up, the investigation to see, "Look at this, look at this." Then we say, "Aha, I see you." Notice that distinction here. Before, I was in it, grasping, clinging in that thought, and now the wake-up, look at that, and then the next one is this moving out Aha, I see you, Mara. I see what I was doing. And now it's separate. It's no longer stuck. It's now separate. So that you begin to separate. Who am I here in the sense? Am I the observer that's observing this? Or am I the thought itself? Who is the thought? Am I the thought? Now, most people, they really are attached to their thoughts. You attach also to feelings: "I am angry," or "I am sad," and they almost always are associated with thoughts: "I'm really troubled," "I'm really upset." No, just thoughts are troubled, and the troubled thoughts will give rise to the feelings of anger, but you are neither one of those things.

**Speaker B:** Like, I feel angry, but I am not the anger.

**Speaker A:** But you're not— you are not the anger itself. It's just sensations of the body that feel the anger.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I am not that thought. You are not the anger.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We can separate, we can move out. You are not the anger itself. That we can gladden that stuff up and take control. Aha, I see you, Mara is a major change in one's life. That changes us from the victim to the winner. It takes us from being attached to being unattached. It takes us from being caught in the world to be above the world. This is a major point. We need to practice that often, over and over and over again, to separate ourselves from our own mind. Aha, I see you, Mara, I see you, I see that unwholesome thought. And that aha, I see you, Mara, is now a wholesome thought. That thought itself is a wholesome thought. Okay, but most people don't understand that. And so when they say, ah, there I go again, I see it, I see it, I see it, okay, but they don't like it, they don't like it. Oh, I'm so stuck in that stuff, right? And so this is where we take the right effort, or the gladdening of the mind, to say, aha, I am not that. Aha, I can separate myself from that stuff. And so now we can begin to make a change in a very wholesome way, and in the sense of gladdening the mind, which means I'm really happy that I can see that crap, as opposed to being really sad because there's just more crap to deal with. Yeah, this is a major change in one's attitude, and we need to foster that attitude from the attitude of being the loser— there I go again, oh poor me, I can't get out of it— into, 'Aha, I see you. Take care of this. I can handle this.'

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so we need to practice this several times a day for about 5-10 minutes, just to practice chilling out, to practice, 'I don't have to have thoughts of unwholesome.' And that you can, by doing that 5 or 6 times a day,

**Speaker B:** it

**Speaker A:** begins to get connected so that you will have connecting thoughts between. So let's figure out for you what would be good just for 60 minutes, 10 minutes apiece, 6 times a day. And so one would be when you first wake up in the morning, that instead of doing what you normally do, you're going to actually stay there for 10 minutes thinking about how nice today is, how refreshed you feel, how I can take a deep breath and just relax. Everything is hunky-dory, and I really enjoy just laying here. So you can set your alarm 10 minutes early. Okay, and do this for about 10 minutes. And then when you lay down at night, letting the cares of the world go away and having thoughts of everything is okay, I don't have any place to go and nothing to do. A lot of people have a bit of insomnia and they want to go to sleep but they can't because they're too busy thinking about something. If you can easily go to sleep, that's great. Go to bed, go to sleep happily. Okay, so we've got 2 of them out of 4. We can find 4 other times a day. One of the times that you could do that would be like if you go to work someplace on public transportation, you can spend 10 minutes on public transportation just enjoying the heck out of your subway ride. Well, I'm not having to think about getting

**Speaker B:** to home office.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, so every time, you know, you can have a little, um, alarm clock or Maybe not. You can have it as an event in the sense that lunchtime, that's always a good time to take out 10 minutes. Okay, and in the middle of the afternoon would be a good time to take out 10 minutes. So instead of taking a coffee break, you can take a happy break. Okay, that might include a cup of coffee. So you can find 4 or 5 times a day that you could just sit for 10 minutes and just chill.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And thoughts of unhappiness, thoughts of someplace else— aha, I don't have to think about Aunt Susie. Aha, I don't have to think about politics. Aha, I don't have to think about the job. I can just sit here and think about breathing in and breathing out and chilling and having a wonderful for a moment.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** this is the beginning of the practice.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, great. Well, let's go ahead and finish now. I think that you've gotten what we need to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we will talk to you later. This has been a really great chat. I've really enjoyed it, and I especially like it when I can see that the students have got it. They've got what I'm talking about.

**Speaker B:** It sure feels great.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Okay, Rahul, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** See you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Have a pleasant day.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you have a wonderful moment.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, you too. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student (Speaker B), centers on adapting traditional Buddhist meditation practice for modern Western life. The core message is about creating separation from the "bog" of society's pressures and habitual thinking to find peace and clarity.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Problem: Life in the "Bog"**
We are born into and saturated by society, which provides both benefits and "crap." Like a waterlogged log in a swamp, our minds are so soaked in societal conditioning—its demands, judgments, and critical thinking—that we can't "catch fire" (achieve insight and peace). We are dependent on it, much like children.

**2. The Traditional Solution vs. The Modern Challenge**
Traditionally, the Buddha advised leaving society (going to the woods, a monastery) to "dry out" and straighten the mind before re-entering with wisdom. In Asian cultures like Thailand, this is culturally supported. For Westerners, this is often impractical due to job, family, and cultural pressures, and the monastic tradition is still new.

**3. The Practical Adaptation: Frequent "Chilling Out"**
Instead of one long, intense retreat, the practice is adapted into daily life:
*   **Goal:** To frequently "get out of the bog" to dry out and "hollow out" the mind, so you can eventually float on top of life's troubles instead of being drowned by them.
*   **Method:** Practice short, frequent sessions of "not doing"—especially not doing the habitual, critical thinking of the mind.
*   **Schedule:** Aim for **6 times a day, for about 10 minutes each** (e.g., upon waking, before sleep, during lunch, on a commute). This interrupts negative mental patterns throughout the day.

**4. The Core Practice: Separation & Gladdening the Mind**
*   **"Aha, I see you, Mara":** This is the key insight. "Mara" represents unwholesome thoughts, hindrances, and societal conditioning. The moment you observe a thought with "Aha, I see you," you **separate yourself from it**. You are not your anger, your worries, or your critical judgments. This moves you from being a victim of your mind to an observer.
*   **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts:** The talk reframes this in practical terms:
    *   **Unwholesome (Akusala):** Critical, judgmental thoughts ("I like this, I hate that"), thoughts about the past/future, and thoughts about things not present. This "critical thinking" is identified as the root of suffering, akin to eating the "fruit of knowledge of good and evil" in the story of Adam and Eve—it destroys your present-moment paradise.
    *   **Wholesome (Kusala):** Nurturing, gladdening thoughts that are present-centered. The feeling of being "warmed up" and content in the current moment is a prime example. The thought "Aha, I see you, Mara" is itself a wholesome, empowering thought.

**5. The Attitude Shift**
The practice requires a fundamental shift from self-criticism ("There I go again, I'm terrible") to joyful investigation ("Aha! I caught that. Excellent!"). It's about **gladdening the mind**, choosing to nurture yourself in the present-moment paradise, rather than constantly judging it.

**In essence:** The talk provides a roadmap for using frequent, short meditation breaks to separate from the oppressive "bog" of societal thinking. By repeatedly practicing present-moment awareness and mentally noting "Aha, I see you" to unwholesome thoughts, you gradually "dry out," gain wisdom, and learn to be *in* the world without being *of* the world.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several extended metaphors and references well-known stories to illustrate the challenges of meditation and spiritual practice in modern Western life. Here are the key metaphors and stories:

### **1. The Primary Metaphor: The Log in the Bog**
This is the central, most detailed metaphor.
*   **The Bog/Swamp:** Represents **society, worldly life, and the untrained mind**—a saturated, messy, all-encompassing environment.
*   **The Waterlogged Log:** Represents the **individual's mind**, which is completely saturated with societal conditioning, habits, thoughts, and pressures ("the doing of the world").
*   **The Fire Starter:** Represents spiritual practice or meditation techniques.
*   **The Process:** You cannot set a waterlogged log (the saturated mind) on fire (achieve insight/awakening) while it's in the bog (engaged in society). You must first haul it out (create **separation** through meditation and seclusion). Even then, it must dry out (through repeated practice) before it can catch fire. Once hollowed out (through insight), it can float on top of the bog, representing being **"in the world but not of it."**

### **2. The "Drain the Swamp" / Alligator Metaphor**
A modern political metaphor used to reinforce the "bog" concept.
*   **The Swamp:** Corrupt or problematic systems (like politics).
*   **The Alligators:** The immediate crises, distractions, and corrupting influences within that system.
*   **The Moral:** When you're "up to your hips in alligators" (overwhelmed by worldly problems), you forget your original intention to "drain the swamp" (achieve peace or insight). You might even "become an alligator" (become part of the problem). The advice is to **stay "high and dry"** to avoid being consumed.

### **3. The Baking Metaphor**
A simpler analogy introduced early on.
*   **Mixed Ingredients:** Represents life as a confusing, inseparable blend of thoughts, duties, and habits.
*   **Separated Ingredients:** Represents the desired state where one can distinguish and work with individual elements (thoughts, feelings) through the "separation" provided by meditation.

### **4. The Story of Adam and Eve**
Used to explain the danger of **critical/judgmental thinking**.
*   **The Fruit of Knowledge of Good and Evil:** Represents the human tendency to label things as "good" or "bad," "like" or "dislike."
*   **Paradise:** Represents the present moment, which is inherently peaceful.
*   **The Fall:** The act of judgment (e.g., "I don't like those yellow leaves") destroys paradise ("paving paradise to put up a parking lot"). The teaching is that judgmental thinking is the root of suffering and obscures the paradise of the present moment.

### **5. The Metaphor of Nurturing vs. Criticism**
*   **Mother Nurturing an Infant:** Represents **wholesome, nurturing thoughts** toward oneself—the kind of gentle, caring attention one should cultivate in meditation.
*   **Mother Becoming Critical:** Represents the **unwholesome, critical thoughts** that society (and we ourselves) adopt, which lead to suffering. The key insight is that we can learn to **nurture ourselves** as we once were nurtured.

### **6. The "Aha, I See You, Mara" Story & Metaphor**
A reference to a famous moment in the Buddha's enlightenment story.
*   **Mara:** Represents **unwholesome thoughts, distractions, hindrances, or the "devil"** of temptation and doubt.
*   **"Aha, I See You":** This phrase symbolizes the **crucial moment of separation and insight**. It is the act of recognizing a thought or hindrance as separate from oneself—the very act of "dragging the log out of the bog." It transforms one from a **victim** of thoughts to an **observer** of them.

### **7. The Kusala Grass Metaphor**
A linguistic metaphor explaining a key Pali term.
*   **Kusala Grass:** A tough grass whose dried leaf could be used as a knife.
*   **Kusala (Wholesome):** Means "what cuts" or "what works"—thoughts that are **useful, skillful, and penetrating** (like a knife that can cut into reality).
*   **Akusala (Unwholesome):** Means "what doesn't cut"—thoughts that are **not useful, not skillful, and don't lead to insight**.

### **Summary of Core Ideas Through Metaphor:**
*   **The Problem:** Our minds are like **waterlogged logs** stuck in the **bog of society**, filled with **judgmental thinking** (the **fruit of good and evil**) and **self-criticism**.
*   **The Solution:** We must create **separation** (haul the log out) through repeated, short meditation sessions ("chilling out"). This allows us to **dry out** (gain clarity) and stop identifying with thoughts (say **"Aha, I see you, Mara"**).
*   **The Goal:** To become **hollowed out** (free from clinging) so we can **float on top of the bog**, being **"in the world but not of it,"** seeing with **wisdom instead of feelings**, and **nurturing ourselves** in the **paradise of the present moment**.
