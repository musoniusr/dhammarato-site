### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I teach high school as my day job, and whenever I tell my students that I use Discord, they look at me like I'm crazy. It seems to be like a young person's universe. So, okay, so yeah, the question that we're grappling with right now is Brett's question, which is, is it possible to be simultaneously a fart smeller and a smart feller? And I personally believe that yes, it is possible, because I think that, you know, we're different selves at different times with different people in different places in our lives. I believe that the concept of sort of code switching, or of, you know, the fact that we fall into different roles with different people, like any of us who've.

**Speaker B:** Samadhi.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like any of us who've been away from our parents for a long time, and then you go back around your parents and then suddenly you're like their child again and they're your parents again, and then you're like a completely different— you're like, you just immediately start performing the pattern of behavior that they expect from you. It's like an algorithm turns on, but then like you're at work Yeah, you're at work and you're, you're, you're a confident, capable person, and then you're around your father who's been calling you, um, you know, who's been sort of expecting you to screw up your whole life, and then you kind of just start tripping over yourself. Um, so, you know, we're different selves around different people and different times in our lives. The self is sort of like a shapeshifter, like Brett just mentioned. So I do think it's possible, um, for somebody who has Anagami, who's at least had sort of the view of the path, who's gained like a sight, a vision of right view, you can say in traditional language here, gain some wisdom, to simultaneously be a fart smeller and a smart feller. You know, you can have a lot of wisdom in the mind and still have old habits arise that are from, you know, prior to the rising of that wisdom that you have to sort of contend with. It's a matter of kind of, I guess, bringing it all together and bringing the mind into unification, which is perhaps why when we look at, what's it called, the Great Forty and then 117, why the path takes a different shape there, Right view precedes virtue, and then it ends with everything coming together in Samatha, Samadhi. So perhaps it is possible that we can have the right view, that the eye of Dhamma, that wisdom, arise in our mind first, and then we still contend with those old habits that have to be purified through virtue. And then when those things all come together, it culminates in in the unification of mind, which is that Samma Samadhi with its 7 helpers. That's how it's articulated in the Great Forty. Yeah, go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker B:** Nice. Yes. And then the crowning path factor of the Noble Eightfold Path then is Right Samadhi, the unification of the mind within it. And then looking at the 4 tetrads in the 4th tetrad, the Pañña function occurs, and within it there is substitution of opposites. And so that zips up and we integrate these things. And so I was also referring to that as well, not simply just surfactant changes in person, how we might perceive or manifest personality, but that's also relevant on a whole nother level. So thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're welcome. Yeah, good question. So I'm curious One thing I love about Dhammarato is his ability to kind of communicate a lot of Dharma in language that people can feel in their bodies. And I have a bit of a different tendency to use a lot more like Sutta kind of base technical language sometimes and lots of visual metaphors. But the reason I bring that up is, is there anybody here who has less acquaintance with the Suttas or like just like Buddhist terminology?

**Speaker C:** Um, absolutely me. I am like brand new.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, what's your name?

**Speaker C:** Uh, Tora.

**Speaker A:** Oh, was that you who said that? I thought— okay, the person below you on my screen was also raising their hand. Yeah, you're completely— you're completely new to, to Buddhism. And so, um, and then the person below you on my screen who came in recently, um, what was your name by the way?

**Speaker B:** I think his mic is— okay, there we go.

**Speaker C:** Uh, it's, uh, Michael, who I have already talked to before, and he was really nice.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Um, and so are there 3 Michaels here? Wow, that is a lot of Michaels, because I'm Michael.

**Speaker D:** So basically, yeah, there's just, there's just you and me, Michael, as the two Michael's. And then Shamile and Tora have both said that they're pretty new to Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** Shamile, okay, great. I kind of like also trying to put faces to the names that I see on Discord as well. So anyway, the reason I bring that up is that if I say something and I use a lot of that type of language and it doesn't make sense, just go ahead and ask me to clarify and I can rephrase it. I'll do my best to do that.

**Speaker B:** Same here, please, because I occasionally use Pali because the way I was taught in the past and the way I experienced practice some of the times and some of the sensations that arose in meditation, in Samadhi, were the taste and the flavor of those sensations had no English equivalence in my experience.

**Speaker A:** That can happen. So Shamile, Tora, Ivan, wondering how you guys are feeling today and if there's any sort of challenges or questions that are coming up in your practice that you wanted to kind of put forward, just to kind of use this space to kind of help everybody's practice.

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure I have, but my mind is kind of blank right now, so if I can't think of anything, I will say it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, Tor, I saw you unmute for a second.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, um, today has been a day of rumination for me, like a lot of, uh, reflection on past mistakes and trying to plan for the future. But my understanding is that Buddhism focuses primarily on the present moment. And the idea of attachment, I guess, is something that I've been reflecting on. You know, as someone who is not only in a relationship, but is polyamorous, like I have multiple partners, you know, the concept of abandoning attachment to them is confusing, but like, like I'm never going to stop loving them, you know? And I feel like on first hearing, that's kind of what abandoning attachment sounds like.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's actually a really great question, I think. And I had this conversation with more poly fundamentalists, I would say, than myself. And the way that I look at it as somebody who's been in a relationship for 21 and a half years, the concept of like abandoning dear ones, as sometimes it's worded, Brett as well has been in a very long relationship. We're both married, not to each other, but you know. So anyway, the way that I like to think of it, just to kind of start on your question, is that If you look and you attend primarily to the Four Noble Truths, and you look at everything else that the Buddha teaches through the context of the Four Noble Truths, everything is referring to sort of our internal response to the world. So the Buddha defines the world as what the mind creates in its relationship between sensation, perception, cognition. So it's sort of like how our mind represents whatever it's processing to us. So what we contact, what we call the world, has already sort of been processed by our organism before we contact it. So most of the Buddha's teaching, if not all of the Buddha's teaching, isn't dealing with external objects. It's dealing with our internal response to it. So when the Buddha talks about abandoning attachment or abandoning craving and clinging, in regard to the world. He's not saying that we need to like throw away the people that we love. He's basically saying that we need to throw away our fixation on the way that it's represented to us by our minds. So let me try to think of an example. So, okay, Relationship's actually a great example. So when you first meet a person and you fall in love with them, right, of course, you know, craving is involved in falling in love. But let's just say it's not 100% that. Let's say that there's more to it than just that. But very soon after people fall in love, oftentimes they start trying to control the person that they're with. They start being afraid that the person might cheat on them. They start trying to change how they dress, how they look, how they speak, what they do, how they behave. And the reason for that is exactly what the Buddha is talking about, is usually when we meet another person, we sort of first form an image of them in our mind, and we almost fall in love with the image we have of that person. And then the reality of that person comes into conflict with the image that we've created. So that mental image that's created of the person that you've you've fallen in love with is actually what the Buddha is talking about when he's talking about attachment. The Pali term for it is Upadana, and it's translated as attachment, but it actually, the word itself means fuel. And it is thought of in 4 different ways, as sensual objects, views, ideas of the self, And I'm forgetting the fourth right now, but essentially it's something that the mind weaves under the influence of desire and ignorance. So these are static concepts, right, that the mind creates, these attachments. They're static concepts. And reality is this ever-changing process. That's what Anicca or impermanence teaches us. And people are ever-changing processes, right? So to love somebody without attachment would actually be of benefit to them and to you because you're never going to try to fix them in accordance with the way that you've created them in your mind, right? We even create ourselves in our minds. Bhante Punyaji, he's a Sri Lankan monk. He's recently— well, not recently, but he's passed in the last 5 or 6 years. He has a really funny thing he says, right? When he talks about sakaya-ditti, yourself-you, he says basically like not only do we create images of other people in our minds through the process of perception, but we create an image of ourselves in our minds that what sakaya-ditti is, is actually a self-image and it's not what you actually look and sound and behave like. And this is probably not going to hit as well with the modern generation because you guys are used to seeing yourselves in pictures all the time. But it used to be pretty common that if somebody brought a picture of you and you'd look at it, you'd say, that's not me, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The photograph doesn't match your mental image, right? Because the mental image is a static concept that you've created of yourself. So the point here is, is that we do that with ourselves. We do that with other people. We do that with objects in the world. And these are actually the sort of attachments you can say that we've created in the mind. And that's what you want to abandon so that you can experience a dynamic reality rather than like your static concepts coming into conflict with this dynamic reality. Yeah, go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker B:** And then dropping into heart with this, and I think we can do that. And I think when we do, it could be quite another perspective that could be practical because once we— Alex. Love without attachment.

**Speaker F:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** Like a Jedi.

**Speaker B:** It brings our relationship— it brings the attachment is the selfish aspect of clinging. It's hard to see. Often we like to cover over this clinging and this selfish aspect with the idea that it's giving, or with the idea that since I'm clinging to you, I love you. And we even, when we say I love you, often we're referring to the cling, we're referring to what we're getting out of it, whether or not we realize that or not. And then with Sati, with practice, the way Anapanasati, following the breath, when we come into this moment and really examine what makes us happy and what makes our partners happy over time, when we grow together and we come closer, regardless of how you define your relationship, monogamous or not, or With selfishness removed, and when that is attenuated, then you can be there. You can, you have the capacity to imagine what makes them happy, often before serving yourself. And I think that's a maturation that can come with commitment to your practice and commitment to your partner or your partners. And I've experienced that. And often patience is the way. If it is, especially in a long-term monogamous relationship where there are aspects of your partner that, or they may be carrying defilements or habit or habitual tendencies that you've put down, but the tendency to judge falls away because once that cling is not there, you can allow them to have the freedom to grow in their own way, in their own practice. And so, okay, so I won't continue on and ramble, but maybe I made some stuff kind of— and it feels wonderful because you're giving more, and selfishness is painful.

**Speaker F:** It's Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Can I say that pretty much aligns with what I feel like I have discovered about monogamy, which is I feel like it itself is an attachment, although I'm not trying to convince anyone to be polyamorous or anything. But I tried that for you. Like, I also have had questions about things like sensuality versus sexuality, where I identify myself as someone who is sex-positive asexual, and I kind of view myself to an extent as somewhat celibate now. In terms of I don't have any particular desire to have sex with people anymore. And I kind of just view relationships as things that can come into my life, and I don't have to put labels on them necessarily. Maybe that itself is an attachment, how I view people as being partners or non-partners. You know, I feel like ideally I'd like to abandon the concept of partners altogether and just have people who I love in my life. And there's people who love me in different ways, whereas I kind of view my love as maybe only being in one way, and sexuality is more something that is an expression of love than it is— and it doesn't have to be, but it can be. And I— that's how I think sexuality can be different from sensuality. Where I feel like sensuality is being attached to sex and viewing it as something that is necessary for one to have, and viewing it as, I don't know, like a necessary goal of life. I think maybe there were times in my life where I viewed it that way, but I don't anymore.

**Speaker A:** One thing that comes to mind for me, a couple things came to mind. One, but the first thing I'll mention is that one of the great things about the way that the Buddha structured his teachings just around the Four Noble Truths is that like, you know, there's just like 8 billion times several trillion things that we could think about, to talk about, to wonder about, to question, right? I say 8 billion because that's how many people are on the planet times 8 trillion things that each human being comes up with in their mind as like, what is important, what's not important, what should I do, what shouldn't I do? And the Buddha was aware of this. His cultural context was ancient, what we now call India, where so many different religious views, philosophical views, cultural views were all around him. And he said, okay, how do I get straight to the point? And, you know, so he reduced everything he taught to what nowadays we would call a radical phenomenology, which is just the presence or absence of one single phenomena, right? Radical phenomenology in the modern sense is attending to the presence or absence of whatever phenomena is here. But the Buddha reduced it even further to just one, which is, you know, we all know what it is, right? It's Dukkha. So the presence or absence of Dukkha, right? So Dukkha, Nirodha. So Buddhism doesn't really feel the need to contend with all of these questions and concerns necessarily that we have now, right? Because we can spin and spin and spin and spin around these things for the rest of our lives. And the Buddha is pretty much— there's so many suttas where he's approached with different discussions And if it falls outside of the realm of what's presently knowable here and now, if it's not knowable here and now, he puts it into the basket of what he calls speculative views, right? And the Buddha abandoned all speculative views. And he says, you know, in the Anagami Vajrayana Sutra that he abandons all positions, all cogitations, essentially. And this is not— well, I mean, this is for the purpose, because our experience of Dukkha is so primary and so prolific that it requires this. It requires a radical sort of focus in order to really get at it, because as soon as you attenuate or satisfy one question, one desire, one doubt, another one will pop up. You know, it's like, uh, it's like.

**Speaker B:** A fungus, a thicket of views. Yeah, a thicket of views.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. A bramble, a thicket here where I live. Morning, Himalayan blackberry of views, which is a bramble.

**Speaker C:** Can I— I am reminded— oh, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** It's a quagmire.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I'm giving you, I'm giving you a broad spectrum answer for all the stuff that you brought up, which.

**Speaker C:** Is that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just, you know, bringing it back to Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which is like being satisfied, completely satisfied with things exactly as they are, no matter what, right? Because our satisfaction becomes independent of circumstances, it becomes independent of answers to questions, it becomes independent of metaphysical positions, philosophical views, religious doctrines. We just sort of make the wise choice to be satisfied with things exactly as they are. That's the inclination of the mind, right? You know, the inclination of the mind is the second item on the attitude. The leaning of the mind is the second item on the Noble Eightfold Path, the first being right view, which is to understand that everything that arises, everything that we experience is arising, sustaining, and passing dependent on causes and conditions. That's the conditions of our culture, the conditions of our biology, the conditions of our personalities. And because the complexity of these conditions are giving rise to what we're coming into contact with, trying to grapple with all of that is sort of fruitless, right? So by understanding all views to be conditioned, whether it's the view of monogamy is the right way to go, the view of polyamory is the right way to go, the view that you should be a Democrat or you should be a Republican or this or that, anything. I mean, it's endless. Anybody you talk to, they'll have something that they think is the most important thing that you should agree with. And that's the worst thing here and the best thing here and a bunch of stuff in between. It's just, it's completely endless. So that's why it really all just comes back to if you want to be, you know, if you want to gain the freedom that the Buddha offers is bringing everything back to that. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Is dissatisfaction present? If dissatisfaction is present in experience, which, you know, if you take a look, it oftentimes is, then that means that at some level you're wanting something that you don't have, which is that craving, right? And then you realize that there's nothing that can truly satisfy the mind. There's nothing external that you can get which can truly satisfy the mind, which is another understanding of Dukkha.

**Speaker F:** Right?

**Speaker A:** That's the object side of Dukkha. So then you abandon the wanting. That's the duty to the Second Noble Truth. You understand what Dukkha is. You understand that, yeah, it's both a subjective thing that we add to experience, and it's the fact that objects of experience can't satisfy. So we know it fully. That's the duty to the First Noble Truth, to know Dukkha. And the Second Noble Truth, the duty to the Second Noble Truth, is to abandon its cause, which is that craving, that wanting things that we don't have. And then the third is to realize it's cessation, which is when it's absent, when you have abandoned craving, when you have abandoned wanting what you don't have, to sort of like delight and appreciate the absence of wanting what you don't have, delight in being satisfied. It all comes down to that. And then doing that is pretty much what the Eightfold Noble Path is. It's paying attention to the presently arisen or the presently enduring experience, seeing if there's dissatisfaction and returning to a state of satisfaction. And when that really gets going, the mind stops producing questions, the mind stops producing problems, the mind stops producing reasons to not be satisfied, essentially. Because, I mean, these are all just different reasons to remain dissatisfied, because craving wants to exist. It only exists when the mind's in a state of dissatisfaction. It's basically the shaking of the mind. And when the mind stills from being satisfied, then craving isn't present. So it's trying to keep itself alive, essentially, by continuing to throw reasons to be unhappy, reasons to be unsatisfied, reasons to feel confused. And we just keep feeding it because we don't realize that's what's going on until we do.

**Speaker E:** Shamil, do you have a question?

**Speaker A:** Oh, who?

**Speaker F:** I.

**Speaker G:** Find it, like, especially with more practice, to be able to apply it very easily when I'm sort of sitting still, but like when I'm sort of moving through everyday life and everything. Very quickly I get like overwhelmed and I have to like take a minute to like sit down and then remember it again. I've always like, I guess, wondered what is the difference between just having to like do stuff and just sitting still that makes it harder to remember? I guess is the question.

**Speaker A:** It gets complicated.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Mind moments occur rapidly. It's fast. The mind is fast. Human speech and internal speech is extremely rapid. And our Sati, our mindfulness, the mental factor that the faculty that we produce that uses lessons from the past to apply observation in the present to spot Dukkha in the light of the First Noble Truth requires us to attend to reality, the here and now, with alertness. And so when we stand up, when there's more stimuli, there's more contact at the sense doors, the aggregates, the clinging aggregates becomes more difficult because both subtle and coarse dukkhas are impacting at a rapid rate. Wouldn't you agree, Michael, that that is a factor. Another thing that I wanted to mention previously when we were just— when Michael was discussing craving so skillfully, is to mention that also aversion is a form of craving. So it's not just wanting in the traditional default kind of what we think of sense, but also wanting to get rid of. So if there are irritants, distractions, or if we develop inside ourselves and a version to another, then that's another form of craving, right? That's Dukkha, craving coming up. We want to get things we don't want. So that's also a basic thing.

**Speaker F:** To cover.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, my favorite way of thinking about Shamile's question, or what's the difference between sitting practice and practicing in the world, is to think about sort of the process of addiction recovery. So, you know, you think of somebody who's addicted to heroin. They have certain settings, certain friends, certain stories that are part of their friend groups. Let's say that at first, I think every addict has a group of friends. Maybe it becomes isolated at a certain point. Ways of seeing the world. And then, you know, so all of these things in recovery would be considered triggers. Like, parents might be triggers, you know, the people you did drugs with might be triggers, your old house might be a trigger, your job might be triggers, stress might be a trigger. And in Buddhist terms, a trigger is basically a condition that gives rise to one or more different versions of the self at a different point. But I won't get into that right now. So in order to get off of a drug, you would first need to go into detox. And then you would need to go into rehab before you can go back out in the world and sort of be in recovery for a long period of time. So like our minds are heavily conditioned every time we've had a desire to get something, or as Brett was mentioning, an aversion, a desire to get rid of something, or any type of confusion about neutral feeling. Our solution is always 100% of the time to want something, right? And then the wanting arises and creates a disturbance in our experience. And then when we acquire the object, that temporary cessation of that wanting is the happiness or the pleasure that we get from the object. And then we attribute that happiness to the object itself, when really it was just a momentary freedom from desire that we actually got when the object came. But this is actually what conditions all of our thinking, all of our speaking, and all of our behavior. This process of being driven towards an object and then experience a relief when we get it. So in the same way that a heroin addict has gotten used to using heroin to deal with stress or confusion or desire or aversion or depression or anxiety or whatever, we're conditioned in the same way. So in a sense, we're all addicts. So what the sitting practice is at first is your detox, right? So when you first go into seclusion, you experience withdrawals. You experience withdrawals from the forms of stimulation you're used to. You experience withdrawals from the social interactions you're used to. You experience withdrawals from the stories and the narratives you're used to hearing, even the stories you tell yourself out loud. You experience withdrawals from your normal patterns of behavior. So it's really unpleasant at first, actually, because now we're not giving craving that fuel. All of those different forms of clinging that are the fuel for craving are not being fed. And so it's just torturing us, right? Like, I mean, it can feel like torment when you first try a sitting practice. If you've ever gone into like a full retreat, it can feel like seriously like withdrawals happening. The Dukkha goes nuts. But then eventually the mind starts to sober up and then we get our first glimpse of the mind in its natural state. So it's like the heroin addict becoming sober. They finish their detox, they've become sober, they have moments of clarity, right? They start to see all the harm that they've done to themselves, all the harm that they've done to others. They feel a sense of like wise shame, wise regret over that. They want to have a desire to amend the harm that they've done to themselves and to others. And they kind of go through that in rehab, right? So that's sort of like you're integrating the sobriety through this process of rehab. But every person who's had an addiction has gone through detox, who's gone through recovery, The rate of relapse is like what, 90% or something? I don't know the actual statistics, right? Because the world is filled with triggers. So this is really to answer your question, Shamile, that our habits of craving, our patterns of clinging, all the different selves that we're used to being are arising from the conditions in the world, our family, our friends, our jobs. So it's autopilot, right? And that's what you're contending with when you go out in the world. So you may be able to sit down in seclusion and start to feel a little bit of calm and a little bit of clarity And then the second you run into your mom or an ex-girlfriend or a boyfriend or somebody that you've had conflict with, or you go to work or some kind of stress, then all of a sudden you're back in an old state of mind, you know, an old birth as it would be understood in dependent origination. So that's why it's difficult. It's difficult for the same reason why it's difficult for an addict who's left rehab to just to kind of stay sober. Helps at all.

**Speaker G:** No, that's really helpful. I mean, it's a little disheartening, but also like a little, like really helpful just putting it in perspective, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Well, Michael, were you going to say something?

**Speaker D:** Sure. So you don't have to see it as disheartening. That's just kind of the way that it is. So we could also use the analogy of practicing violin or a musical instrument, right? I use violin because it's an instrument I'm somewhat familiar with, and it can take quite a while to get proficient at it. And with violin, someone who can really perform violin very well can get up on stage, stand up, dance around, kick their feet up in the air, this sort of thing. But asking someone who's just a beginner, who doesn't have much experience, to dance and try to play the violin at the same time, they're just going to fall apart. They're not going to be able to perform anything at all. It's like, first, just sit down, practice playing violin, you know, getting yourself into a wholesome state, you know, having wholesome thoughts one after the other. And as you do that more and more sitting, oh, well, now you can do it standing. Now you can do it maybe walking.

**Speaker A:** A little bit, right?

**Speaker D:** You know, now maybe you can even do it in the middle of a conversation while you're talking with a friend or someone you know. It's like, oh, I just had an unwholesome thought and I can change that, right? So, you know, the seclusion part, that's just a necessary part. For everyone, and it just is an easy way to begin practicing sitting in seclusion.

**Speaker A:** That's a great one. Yeah, that's a great metaphor.

**Speaker G:** That's really helpful. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** For further listening or inspiration on this topic, Arhat Anicca has a recording, one of his guided meditations, and I found it. Even the Dhamma talk, I like to listen to his meditations.

**Speaker A:** I get it.

**Speaker B:** It's just the sound of his voice, the energy. It's wonderful. But even the Dharma talks are quite skillful sometimes. And he has one entitled Tips on Monotasking. Instead of multitasking, tips on monotasking.

**Speaker A:** Single-act Samadhi is what they call it in Zen.

**Speaker B:** Precisely.

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, also, um, Shamile, when you said it was disheartening, my mind was like, you know, what would Dhammarato say to that? You know, he always brings it back to, um, really, uh, it's either an unwholesome thought or a wholesome thought that's present in your mind, right?

**Speaker G:** No, he'd be like, oh no, woe is me, it's so hard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but what's delightful and heartening, you could say, is that because this is such deep-rooted conditioning, I mean, you know, I like to think of it as from an evolutionary perspective, this is how nature, you know, made it easy for us to survive. We don't have to think about everything we do. We're just kind of like driven by unconscious drives, right? And I think of the Buddhist teaching as sort of like, um, uh, something that came in that nature kind of brought to us in order to like get us out of this stage of evolution where we still need the reptilian brain. But anyway, um, what's heartening though is that, is that you have encountered, uh, a very sort of like effective, easy, dare I say, um, instruction on the Dharma. And yeah, most people, 99% of people, 99.9% of people, probably live their lives stuck in this condition. And so what's heartening is that you don't have to. You now, you know, you have a choice not to. And it may appear difficult at times, or difficult in the beginning, or difficulty may arise and pass. But you know, you should feel delighted and heartened rather than dishearten that now you have a choice. Um, because the interesting thing about— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sorry. Whenever he spots disheartening, that's the second noble truth. So he just spotted Mara. I saw you. I spotted you, Mara. Hot dog. And just smile. I mean, it's a victory when you spot the second noble truth. Then you can apply the Noble Eight Path and slide into home. That's number three.

**Speaker A:** Is Mara doubt? Mara is like a personification of— I mean, doubt, yeah, would definitely be one major form of Mara. But yeah, I guess you could think of Mara as a personification of the Second Noble Truth of like the cause of suffering, right? He kind of runs the sensual realm. You know, he governs He just— they give him as a personification of the second noble truth. Yeah, because he has three daughters, and it's Loba, Moha, and Dosa, which is greed, hatred, and delusion. That's the three— there are three forms of craving, the three forms that craving takes. So anytime you see those— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** He's— Mara is me when I'm in delusion, essentially. Or yeah, you can do it that way. Yeah, if I'm the practitioner in general, if it's us when we're in delusion. Not an entity outside of this body one fathom in length. The whole practice is within this body.

**Speaker A:** One fathom in length. The word Mara is also another word for death, you know. So there's Mara, like, as in Anicca. Amara means deathless, right? Like, Amaravati is the deathless realm. And there's— it's like a shared concept between Buddhism and Christianity that the idea that life and death are sort of conditioned. But in Buddhism, it's sort of birth and death are conditioned. I think of life as being void of birth and death because birth is the arising of these different mental states that you become fully identified with. But, you know, one thing I thought about talking about today that I think is super helpful to this discussion, and that I don't know if Dhammarato does it on purpose, but he seems to really get people past the lower three fetters without them realizing it. So I thought about talking about the lower three fetters and why they're kind of so important to understand. That's something you guys are interested in. I won't make it super long because I'm not really— does anybody know what time it is? My phone is not showing me the time while I'm here. How long have we been on this call for so far?

**Speaker D:** 45 minutes.

**Speaker B:** 45 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And the reason I bring it up is because of what Shamile said about it being disheartening. And So people don't generally change, right? Like most people just sort of like receive a certain conditioning in their childhood and then in their adolescence they sort of try to become their own person. And then, but most of us who've lived a little longer know that there's a certain point where you start to become your father or you start to become your mother, right? I'm talking to people who might still be in their mid-20s, so you don't know that yet. Trust me, it's true. And, but if you think about the lower three fetters, I think that the Buddha talked about the lower three fetters as the lower three fetters because they're the things that prevent us from being able to change, right? So there's identity view, which is your self-image. This is me, this is mine, this is who I am. Then there's Sila, Bhavana, Arahant, which is attachment to rights, rules, and rituals. You can think of it as cultural conventions. And then there's doubt, you know. So think of any conversation you've had with somebody where you've been very frustrated and trying to change their mind, like, you know, telling— I'm not sure. Okay, maybe in like 15 or 20 minutes. 15 minutes. So yeah, think of when, let's say, I'm trying to think of an analogy that wouldn't necessarily— okay, let's just say that somebody has issues with anger. Okay, let's just use anger as an example. And or they have— let's say they have issues with just like sadness and depression. That's a better one, I think. And you tell them like, oh, hey, you know, maybe you should just try changing the way you think. And they say, oh, that's not who I am. You know, I'm not the type of person who can do that. I don't have that kind of mind. Right. That's attachment to identity view. They have this fixed idea of who they are. This is this is how they think, this is how they feel, right? They're a sad person, they're somebody who can't change, or somebody who can't change their behavior. Why don't you just go for a walk? That's not, that's not who I am, you know, right? So identity view, right? This is like all the ideas that we have, these fixed ideas that we have about ourselves, these fixations of this attachments to self view, right? So that's, that's the first fetter to change, right? If you don't If you're identified with your suffering, and if you go back and watch all of these thousands of videos Dhammarato has with people, there are some people he talks to, and this is not uncommon, who they don't want to get out of the feeling of being poor me, that poor me feeling. They're heavily identified with their victimhood. And of course, you know, like it's, you know, parents reward us when we're sick and when we're sad, and our whole society rewards victimhood now. So You know, being identified with being hurt or broken is quite common. So that's just one example, right, where identity view is an obstacle to change. And then, you know, Sila Bhante Beremasa, attachment to rights, rules, and rituals that— and I love the fact that Dhammarato puts this as like shoulds and shouldn'ts, right? I should do this, I shouldn't do that. He calls it the critical parent, right? Things should be this way. They shouldn't be that way. You should be angry about this. You shouldn't be okay with that. You know, all of these, all of this cultural conditioning. When my wife and I were in Thailand, everybody picked up everybody else's kids. They would take people's kids and put them in each other's laps. If you did that in the US, that would really piss the mother off, right? You shouldn't touch anybody else's kids, right? We have different cultural conditioning. Conditions, different ideas of what's appropriate, what's not appropriate, cutting the line or jumping the queue, as they say in English culture. When they go to Spain, they're notoriously frustrated because they can't get on a bus, or if they go to India, they can't get on a bus because there's nobody queuing or lining up in India or Spain. They're just running on the bus, right? But our attachment to what we should or shouldn't do, or in the religious context, the belief that like a rite or ritual will lead to liberation, that if I just do the right thing, I'm going to get the right reward, or if I just do 100,000 hours of meditation, I'm going to get enlightenment. We could sit down, and this used to sadden me, you could see monks who spent 20, 30, 40, 50 years sitting down and watching their breath or doing whatever kind of meditation, and they still are bringing up the same questions that you're starting out with. You're like, what's going on here? Well, it's because they have this faith or this attachment that if they just do this practice for long enough, it's going to bear fruit, when they're just missing the fact that they need to kind of turn around and look in the right spot, right? So this, these rules, these conventions, these beliefs are a major obstacle to us waking up and being able to change and be satisfied here now. And then last but definitely not least is doubt, which takes the form of questioning, right? And all of these different things that I've realized are different ways that craving has formed itself. It forms itself into your identity. It forms itself into culture when it's shared. And it manifests as endless, endless questions which are related to what we think should or shouldn't be the answer. You might ask somebody who you're talking to a question. If they give you an answer to a view that you have that you feel is the wrong answer, then you might be like, okay, I'm not going to listen to this person. So these three lower fetters are the major obstacles to being able to, as Dhammarato would say, like wake up, take a look, and make a change. Um, so I just wanted to put that out there for you guys to think about and, and, and see what— see how you felt about it, right?

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Michael.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** And thank you. Is it important, since we are discussing things kind of at a beginner or intermediate level as well, to make a distinction between the doubt that's one of the Nivarana hindrances, psychic irritants, and the doubt that is the fetter?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there is a difference. And so the doubt that's the Nivarana is— well, Bhante Paññañji translates that one as mental oscillation. It's sort of like indecision. I call that like when you go to Safeway and you can't choose a cereal because there's so many cereals and looking at all the ingredients or you can't choose a dog food, or you can't choose a cat food, or whatever. There's so many choices, like, you're just like indecisive, you know. But, you know, it does manifest as just endless questioning as well, just uncertainty about your situation, especially when it comes to neutral feeling. But yeah, the doubt that's the fetter is specifically the doubt about what is and what isn't the path.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And that doubt is extremely powerful because there's like 10 million trillion things that aren't the path, and there's one thing that is the path. And, you know, which is to just have a religious devotion to being okay with everything as it is. Honestly, if there's no other way I could put it.

**Speaker B:** But, um, yeah, outside of lobha, dosa, moha, which is not the path.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, those are all just different forms of dissatisfaction. So being satisfied is sort of the antidote to all those different forms of dissatisfaction. Um, and, you know, it's just, it's just sort of like being devoted to being satisfied because the mind has been keeping you dissatisfied your whole life, and it knows exactly how to talk to you. It's like an abusive lover who like makes you feel good sometimes, make you feel bad other times, knows exactly what to say to get you back in the relationship. I've never actually experienced a relationship like this, by the way. This isn't personal sharing, but it's just an analogy. But yeah, it knows exactly what to say to you, like what questions to make you ask, what images to put in your mind, you know. So, so yeah, that's, that's sort of all the million different reasons to be dissatisfied. That's not the path. And then the sort of devotion to being okay with things exactly as they are, that, that's what the path is. Um, and the immediate reaction to that people usually have is like, well, the only reason that people don't want to accept that, especially Buddhists don't want to accept it, is because you're like, well, this can't be it. I was expecting some big explosive bliss, right? But you know, that's still dissatisfaction. So you're not really experiencing things as they are. You're not really okay with things as they are because you're still not satisfied. The satisfaction has to become complete in order for you to kind of experience what the mind is like when it's free of desire. So you just kind of have to keep doing it over and over and over, like Dhammarato says. And you know, it's satisfaction. It's beautiful in the beginning. Leads to deeper satisfaction. It's beautiful in the middle, leads to complete satisfaction. It's beautiful in the end. And that complete satisfaction is where dissatisfaction leads, right? You can't get from dissatisfaction to satisfaction. You have to go from satisfaction to deeper satisfaction to complete satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** And our vehicle is relinquishment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, relinquishment of Dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Dukkha. And so I think there's also another function doubt can play, or another disturbance doubt can arise in, and that's in the 8th path factor of right concentration. And so then on our way into concentration, doubt can arise as, I can't do this, I don't have the right method, I don't have the right teacher. None of those are true unless you believe they are, and you won't— then you will have Mīt��a Samadhi until you do. Gladden the mind, live the holy life, and, you know, your Sila helps your concentration, which brings you into discernment, which improves your Sila, which makes concentration easier, which brings more discernment, and on and on and on. And that's our Sila, our Panna, our concentration. They all three interplay our wisdom, our Jhana, and our virtue. They're a dance.

**Speaker A:** You know what's one way you can check it? When you just ask yourself— I could ask you all right now, you know, is there any object, any person, any idea that you— that when you get that then you'll be completely satisfied? Like, do you— that you know, okay, when I get this person, when I get this thing, when I get this, when I have this level of understanding, like, then I will be satisfied? Like, do you believe that narrative that the mind tells you, you know, when you actually think about it?

**Speaker B:** I'm satisfied.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, this reminds me of the Byron, Katie, do you know that it's true? Can you be absolutely certain that it's true? Something like this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I mean, because— oh, go ahead.

**Speaker G:** I mean, the only thing I would really like to think about is like if I had an empty room and like, like time to just sit there forever, I'd be satisfied. But like, I can't do that. I'll die of starvation.

**Speaker A:** Right, but what if I told you there were plenty of people out there who have like beautiful cabins in forests in Thailand and all the time in the world and they're just sitting there being unhappy, you know? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Stay in an empty room in Thailand, hit me up and we'll, uh, we'll get you over here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, those are available.

**Speaker B:** Sounds like one of Sounds like one of my cats is not satisfied. Let's see what's happening over here. Oh, I guess it was just a patch of anxiety.

**Speaker A:** The point there is that if you're not satisfied with things as they are, then nothing will make you satisfied. That's just like the truth. That clicks at a certain point. You know, my image, you know, when I first met Dhammarato was that like there was that this, you know, a secluded forest and me blissing out on Nibbana, whatever that might be, you know. And, you know, he pointed out that that's a concept that the mind has created that I'm wanting, you know. So I'm stuck in this wanting for this mental concoction of Nibbana, this perfect situation, you know, which— that's a spiritual materialism. Most of us have other things that we want, you know, that is like our perfect circumstance where we'll be satisfied.

**Speaker F:** But.

**Speaker A:** It'S really, it's really, um, like at the point when you give up that dissatisfaction that you do become satisfied. It's sort of like, it's sort of like we're walking around with 10 boulders in our hands and on our back, and The Buddha is like, oh, you know what, actually there's this great bliss you can get from meditation, but you got to put down those three boulders. And you're like, okay, here, I'll put these down. Oh, you know, gives you some— but you're actually— the bliss you're feeling is like the relief of putting those three boulders down. You think it's the meditation, but it's actually just you put three boulders down, you feel better. He's like, oh, you know what, there's actually a higher bliss if you put two more of those down. And you're like, put them down. You're like, oh, this is better. But actually it's putting two more boulders down that made you feel better. And he's like, actually the greatest thing in the world is this thing called Nibbana. You know, it's the highest happiness. You've got to put the rest of those boulders down. So you put them all down and then you're like, oh, this really is great. And then it's like, but you realize that it's actually just like, it's the relief of having put down all of the boulders that actually feels good. And the promise of of the attainments was just there to convince you to put them down. And really, you didn't gain anything at all. You just were convinced to put a bunch of shit down, and the happiness that you have now is the relief of not carrying all this crap around anymore. Um, and like, that's, that's the way that I, I see the path now, just being convinced to let a bunch of shit go until you have nothing left that you're carrying.

**Speaker B:** And even in the progress of concentration, it often gets looked at as climbing up a hill or some sort of striving, when really right concentration in the sequence of Jhana is a sequence of letting go. And even if someone or if a practice approaches it in, as some folks do, a more nuanced and technical way, still with 4 or 5 factors starting out or whatever they do, it's still a matter of dropping factors until more subtle and subtle and subtle states of mind arise in which more and more subtle defilements can be seen and then dropped.

**Speaker E:** Can I ask something? I realize that usually in my practice, I have unrealistic expectation of like, oh, I need to drop all this grasping and clinging that my mind is holding on to. And I find that to be really hard. So usually I just tell myself, just let go of this one thing right now. And then eventually, without expectation, it just feels good enough and it feels building up, and then it just— this satisfaction just keeps arising. And then eventually it just feels futile to hold on to anything. I'm not sure why I say this, because I think when I start, when I really just started practicing, I have this like, oh, I need to renounce everything, and it's so difficult. And it usually shoots myself in the foot, like it costs me more Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's your, there's that thought, that unwholesome thought, I need to, right? Um, yeah, that's you being dissatisfied with your holding on to things. So you got to start by being satisfied with your holding on to things and then become satisfied enough to, to let them go, rather than telling yourself that you need to let them go and then be mad at yourself for not being able to let them go. A little weird knot that the mind makes.

**Speaker B:** Ivan, are you referring then to your practice that you've discussed about waking up in the morning in more of a formal sit, or are you discussing practicing throughout the day, pushing these things?

**Speaker E:** I will say both. Because it's just.

**Speaker F:** Formal.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What I did What I often do and what I did throughout my own attempt to train the mind in Anapanasati is when those thoughts would come up, when those feelings of aversion for these thoughts of confusion, these thoughts of, "Oh, I should just get rid of all these things and quiet the mind," the antidote to that, of course, is just forget about that and stick with the breath itself. And the closer you get to the breath, or if you want to the entire body with the breath and feel how be sensitive to the entire body as you breathe in and you breathe out. But staying with the object, and that's what the object's for. And the longer you stay with the object, these things will fall away and you don't have to push them away. The process of Anapanasati itself is carefully designed by the Buddha to do that. And it will, especially if you keep at it and that you don't overly judge yourself or judge your practice, especially while you're doing it, because that's gaining mind comparison mind. And that's going to be an irritant, as Michael pointed out. It's an unwholesome thought. And so starting with an unwholesome thought, is going to be an obstacle to Jhana, right concentration, and seeing the links of dependent origination, if that's what you're after.

**Speaker E:** Yes, that makes sense.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker F:** You're welcome. I got a quick question, you guys. First of all, thank you for this. I keep wanting to say satsang because I listened to some Hindu stuff too, and I'm like, no, no, this is a Sangha. But anyway, maybe I'm doing too many things at the same time, but you know, it's helped me so much already, especially accepting, you know, I'm married, I got kids. I was doing dishes while I was listening to you guys, so it was great. But one place where I struggle a little bit is with— my daughter's over here, say hi.

**Speaker D:** Hi.

**Speaker F:** Hello. So where I struggle— what do you want, baby? Your head? Go see mom, okay? I'll be right there. Sorry about that. One place where I struggle a little bit is work. So I went to school really late I got my degree in accounting, but I was doing all kinds of stuff before. And then, and so I got great grades and all that, but once I got to work, it was like totally different. It's like, oh man, the pressure and all that. It's nothing like school. Like most things, you know, school is one thing, work is another. And so I've been struggling at work, you know, I get my numbers, but it's like pretty low. And I've already kind of applied this thing where it's like, let's not worry about it. You know, while doing everything. Like, I would think about it all day long after work and all that. And I realized this was wrong, but I didn't know how not to do it. Except, you know, when what's his name, Mr. Dhammarato, was like, well, you know, feel good right now. You know, everything is fine right now. There's no problem. And just by doing that, it's helped a lot already. But it's still not to the level I want. And I realized that's a desire. So just by trying to formulate this thing with you guys, I was already kind of answering my question. I was like, oh, you know, if I just relax there too, you know, I probably will do a lot better. But I just want to get your opinion and see, you know, because some of you guys have dropped a lot of wisdom just in this one little talk here, gathering. So what would you— because I'm always trying to ask like a million questions. I'm trying to wait a minute, what's the most important one that I'm struggling with right now? Let's start with this maybe, and then we'll get to all this other stuff that I'm interested in. So yes, what you guys have anything? I mean, maybe not work, but something that you're struggling with. Is it just a relaxing? I just need to practice more of the same and being happy with, you know, because I find myself moments I work where I'm super happy. I just did something. I finished it. I didn't think I was going to, but I did it way before. So just like, at one point, does something— what's the word? A wholesome thought. Like, wanting to get really faster and better at things. Is that really a wholesome thought? Like, maybe it's not really a wholesome thought. So anyway, I'll stop now and you guys chime in.

**Speaker A:** I recently articulated this to myself. The answer to every question, to every question you can ask, is because I'm not satisfied, or because you're not satisfied. Why am I asking this question? Because you're not satisfied. Why isn't this good enough? Because you're not satisfied. Why am I Why am I not happy at work? Because you're not satisfied. Why am I stressed out with my kids? Because I'm not satisfied. Like, if you start with, like we all do, a desire to feel a certain specific way, like happy or relaxed or joyful or with deep understanding, then you're starting with desire. This is what makes it difficult. Because if you begin with desire, you'll continue with desire, and desire is what's giving rise Dukkha, right? So being satisfied, the reason that this decision, this devotion to satisfaction works, is because you're being satisfied with things exactly as they are. Even if the body-mind is depressed, if the body-mind is anxious, if it's stressed, if it's tired, if it's restless, if it's whatever it may be, if it's happy, if it's sad, you know, the aggregates, the you know, form, feeling, perception, thinking, consciousness. You know, feeling is one of the aggregates. We don't have much direct control over what feelings are rising and passing. What we do have control over is the Tanha, which is the reaction to the feeling. So, you know, there's those three forms of craving, which is wanting, wanting to get rid of, and sort of being confused about, right? So we want the good feeling, We want to get rid of the bad feelings, and we get confused about neutral feeling because we're so conditioned by good and bad feeling. So making the choice, making the decision to be satisfied with whatever arises, you're basically starving that craving, that emotional reaction, that Tanha, of its fuel of dissatisfaction. So you just continue to be satisfied. You wake up in the morning, you feel groggy and tired. This is fine. This is good enough. You know, you get stressed out, you go to work, you're tired at work, you're angry at work. This is just fine. It's fine. You feel the cooling effect right away and you just keep returning to being satisfied. And then you get distracted because all of that relief creates like a bliss, right? You get so distracted by the bliss. You're like, oh, now I feel the way this is great. But then you start wanting to feel that way. So you're back in dissatisfaction again. You're back in wanting again. And you've removed the cause for the bliss, because the cause of that bliss was being satisfied, was not wanting, right? So it's just, it's always returning to being satisfied with things just as they are. You've been conditioning yourself a certain way for your entire life. You know, if you want to take on different cosmology for eons, expansions and contractions of the universe, right? All of those old conditions are not going to stop arising and passing right away. They say in the suttas that even Arahants experience old karmic states of mind. That's like being— it's Nibbana with remainder, right? There's Nibbana without remainder, and there's Nibbana with remainder. So even an Arahant has remainder. Even the Buddha was followed by Mara for 7 years after his awakening. So Mara kept coming back to him. He just wasn't able to access him because the Buddha— there's a point where the mind sees the absurdity of giving rise any dissatisfaction at all. It just always returns to a state of satisfaction, and that's the path. That's what you have to do. You have to just be satisfied with whatever is presently arising in your experience, and that will be the cause of your joy and your happiness.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker B:** You want to arrive at a satisfied emotional default set point. But I think something I wanted to say, and can I say something to answer the thrust at the beginning of this question? I think you He almost was asking for a practice at work. But I think a prerequisite for everything Michael has correctly said is awareness. So when we go to work, if we go to work, bring awareness there with you. I mean, you're going to be busy, you're going to be doing what you do. But when you're speaking to someone at work, when you're working hard, if you're struck, if there's a sense of challenge, whatever's arising, be aware. In Buddhism, we call that Sati. When that's clear and broad, we call that Sati-Sampajanna in Pali. That means clear seeing. And so, but any light kind of awareness that you can bring and just knowing yourself as you are working and being aware, and then you can spot these things that Michael is referring to and you can return to satisfaction as soon as you spot them. And the proof will be in the pudding. Thank you, Vinaya.

**Speaker F:** Well done, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker F:** No, it helps. And it's true because by relaxing and being satisfied in moments during my work, I suddenly started spotting like, you know, certain things that are clearly— I'm clearly doing wrong. Like I'm spending way more time on a refund or whatever the heck, and my mind is going in 20 different ways. But I wasn't seeing that, you know, I've been there for like 6 years. I wasn't really seeing that. I was just seeing this dissatisfaction and nothing else. Then suddenly, by accepting everything— except I'm not doing it long enough, it just comes once in a while. So I understand it's a practice. But just the last couple of weeks, I had so many insights, and I'm like, I haven't done anything different other than relaxing into it, seeing this is okay right now. I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing anyway. So why think about the next 10 things, or if this day is going to be successful? I'm doing it right now. Like, let's not even think about that. I see you, Mara, you know. So yeah, um, but I thought maybe there was something else I was missing. Hot dog, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That sounds good.

**Speaker F:** I got a guy at work who just went through cancer, and he came out, you know, supposedly free, and, uh, somebody gave him, uh, Thich Nhat Hanh's book. And I was like, maybe I should introduce him to Dhammarato because, I mean, Thich Nhat Hanh is great, but this guy's all he is is into movies and stuff. I'm thinking that's probably going to be really boring for him, but Dhammarato is definitely not going to be boring for him. So I'm still thinking about that. Thank you guys, I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** You can lead the horse.

**Speaker B:** Thank you for sharing.

**Speaker A:** It's a benefit.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Or Michael, you looked like you were trying to say something.

**Speaker D:** Uh, no, it's fine. What I was going to say has been covered.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** Not in your words.

**Speaker D:** And to— I'll just say this, you know, just find, find ways of taking a break, you know, even at work, basically. And there's a lot of ways to do that. And this is where we can talk about, you know, getting yourself into seclusion is also a skill. You know, it's like you can, you can go to the bathroom, you can go out where the smokers, you know, go take a smoke, but you don't have to smoke, you know, you can just go out there and chill. You know, there's, there's all of these sort of like little hacks that you can find for taking it easy at work, basically. And, you know, one thing Dhammarato has talked about many times before is like, you know, the The person, you know, the person who's friends with the boss doesn't get fired, basically. So, you know, just be friendly with your boss.

**Speaker F:** I do remember him saying that.

**Speaker D:** Yes, with your coworkers.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, make people smile.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, just take it easy.

**Speaker F:** This is Well, you know, it's really funny because ever since I've been listening to Dhammarato, now I'm thinking, so what is meditation good for? Like, I know it's on the Eightfold Noble Path, but he never even really mentioned it. I mean, is it like saying, aha, Mara, I see you. Is that kind of like the end of the meditation? You know, like, when do you meditate? Or when does he meditate? And what is he anyway? Is he a Bhikkhu? Is he like My wife asked me, so who is this dude that you listen to? And I'm like, it's just Dhammarato. I don't know. Is he an Anagami? Is he an Anapanasati? Is he an Arahant? Is he what is he? Anyway, let's answer the meditation question first. I mean, do you guys just do that separately? Okay.

**Speaker A:** It goes back to my analogy about detox. Meditation, the sitting, a formal sitting practice is like a sensory detox. The mind is so intoxicated by its normal conditioning, it's very difficult to see clearly, it's very difficult to see with wisdom. So like a formal sitting practice is a way of like detoxing the mind and getting the mind comfortable with a neutral object like the breath, because it's what the mind is very confused around neutral objects, like objects that give rise to neutral feeling like the breath. It chases after good feelings and it runs away from bad feelings, but when it comes to a neutral feeling, it just spins in circles. It doesn't know what to do. So you get the mind to kind of like be comfortable with a neutral object. You know, there's an analogy in the suttas about tying a wild animal to a post. It's going to thrash and thrash and thrash and thrash and thrash, and eventually it's going to settle down and settle down and settle down and settle down, and then it's going to stop, you know. So it's like you're tying the mind to this neutral object. And but related to what Brett said about Sati, you know, Sati, Sati is to remember, right? So in the sitting practice, it's to remember the breath or to remember the body. And even in the moving throughout different postures is to remember the body, to remember the feelings, to remember the states of mind, to remember the objects of mind. But, you know, after the arising of right view in Sutta language, Anapanasati is to remember right view. It's to remember the path. So in the way that we discuss it here, it's to remember to be satisfied. That's Samma Sati. It's always to remember to be satisfied. And in the Great Forty, MN 117, Majjhima Nikaya 117, The Buddha talks about the Noble Eightfold Path differently for a noble practitioner, somebody who's had right view. First of all, he changes it from Sila, Samadhi, Pañña to, you know, Pañña, Sila, Samadhi. But he calls it Samma Samadhi with its seven helpers. So getting to your point, is the is the word that's usually translated as meditation, although it's probably better— Bhavana is probably what we're really thinking of, which means cultivation. But essentially, the actual samma samadhi, the samadhi, the meditation of the noble path, is when all of the eight factors come together, come to a fruition, come and unify together. So, you know, and that's led, he says, in the that's suited by noble right view, remembering to be satisfied. We're going to use Dhammarato's way of explaining noble right view because I think it's the most workable. Remembering to be satisfied. So when we're remembering to be satisfied, then we're abandoning the desire to get things, to acquire things. So we're then also achieving the second factor, which is right renunciation, right inclination. Right attitude. So remembering to be satisfied, we're letting go of wanting things we don't have. And then of course, since we're satisfied, we're abandoning unwholesome speech, we're abandoning unwholesome action, we're abandoning unwholesome lifestyles or livelihoods. Remembering to be satisfied, we are, you know, replacing unwholesome thoughts with unwholesome thoughts. That's the right effort. So all of those things functioning together, that's what Noble Right Samadhi is, right? That's what Samma Samadhi is. So we're always looking for like the sitting practice, right? But you know, the sitting practice is like what Michael was talking about. It's like that practice, play, performance, play analogy that Dhammarato uses. Like it's going into seclusion. And the reason that we sit in seclusion is because it's It's the most sort of awake while being inactive posture. It's reducing stimulation to, you know, just a little bit so we don't have to focus on so much. So that's kind of its function. But that sitting meditation, the way that you think of it in your mind, that's not what the Buddha is talking about when he talks about Samma Samadhi. The Samma Samadhi is the accumulation, the coming together of all 8 factors of the path. It's like a chemical equation, you know, like, um, if you were trying to create a certain chemical reaction and it required 8 elements and one was missing, you wouldn't get the chemical reaction, right? So when all ingredients are together and that chemical reaction— that's the, the knowledge and deliverance, essentially. Um, but that's what Samma Sanghappa It's bringing all the factors of the path together. And yeah, so the sitting practice is—.

**Speaker F:** I need to dive into it.

**Speaker A:** It's a controlled setting. Like, I mean, yeah, exactly what Michael said. You're not going to run around practicing violin on the street. You got to sit down in a quiet room and learn how to do it first.

**Speaker B:** Can I ask kind of a semi-technical question for you, Michael? Sort of semi.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** What about.

**Speaker B:** The four rupa jhanas and the four more arupa jhanas?

**Speaker A:** Okay. So I'm going to go with Bhante Pañña's take on this.

**Speaker F:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, which is— and I would say that it matches with experience as well. Um, you know, Bhante Paññaji— I'm not going to get into the reason why he translates everything the way he does, but he basically says that the form Jhanas are the emotional realm and the formless Jhanas are the realm of perception. So, um, when you get into.

**Speaker B:** Um.

**Speaker A:** You know, the first, second, third, and fourth Jhana. It's an ever— it's sort of— and it's a standing out of emotional reactivity, essentially. Like, it's a sense of coolness of the Citta, right? Like, the emotional part of the mind is cool. So it gives us a glimpse of, like, you can really only understand something in its absence, right? So A frog knows what wetness is, but a fish doesn't, right? So a frog knows what wetness is because it's been dry, but a fish doesn't know that water is wet because the fish has never been out of the water long enough to become dry. So when you enter into the form jhanas, you become dry of emotion, essentially, and it gives the mind a deep insight into how like that craving conditions it, right? When you get into the formless genres, processes of perception start to cease. So you start to see how not just emotion conditions your experience, but.

**Speaker F:** Like.

**Speaker A:** The actual process of perception, you know, that's when you start to see how like, you know, consciousness and its interaction with, you know, different types of mental fabrications like concepts, name and form, and, you know, the way that the senses and the objects come together to create the self and the world and its objects. You start to see how these things are constructed and deconstructed. And so you basically come— going through all the jhanas, you see directly how the the world is completely constructed, and it disillusions the mind to the solidity of all the static concepts that you hold at that point. It makes it easier to detach, to have dispassion, disenchantment, and relinquishment towards the mind's representations towards the world. So that's kind of the function of going through the jhanas. You know, we might need to see the conditioned arising of all of our reality at that level in order to be able to renounce it. Or somebody who has faith mind, right? He talks about an Anicca follower and a Dhamma follower. They might just be able to take someone's word for it, and they might be able to abandon. It's always about abandoning craving and clinging, you know. You may not need to go through so many jhanas in order to abandon that craving and clinging. You may just need to like hear somebody say it in such a way that makes it makes sense to you, and then you can abandon that craving thing in there. So that's just like a— that would.

**Speaker B:** Be a very long— 64 to cover.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, I mean.

**Speaker B:** Michael, you pointed out to me a number of weeks.

**Speaker F:** Ago.

**Speaker B:** Sutta number 64 in the Majjhima Nikāya, and in the end of it, the Buddha answers Ananda's question of Why are some released by mind, Citta, and some are released by wisdom, Pañña? And he said that Ananda is dependent on their faculties. And so different form.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Have different need in the practice here. And I can say with experience, a certain number for me, for this practice, for this practice here, a certain number of years of formal sitting practice, I believe, I believe in this practice was a benefit. Oh yeah, that might not apply to anyone else.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's fine. I mean, sometimes I forget about all that stuff that was there before, you know. But anyway, I don't get into all that. Like a lot of— not necessary. Sobering up, I called it, you know. Yeah, but anywho.

**Speaker B:** That's skillful. I like that. Yeah, the simile of the detox.

**Speaker A:** All right, this might be a good point to end the call if nobody else has any comments or questions. Hoping everybody feels satisfied.

**Speaker D:** Thank you for hosting, Michael, and good to see everyone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you guys.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Michael.

**Speaker F:** That was great, guys. Really enjoyed it.

**Speaker B:** Take care, everyone.

**Speaker F:** But I'm not attached to it.

**Speaker A:** All right, have a great night.

**Speaker B:** I'll see you guys next time.

**Speaker A:** We're at one of the Sangha calls. See you again. All right.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, we'll do this kind of thing.

**Speaker A:** Where I can never be on the call.

**Speaker B:** Samma Sanghappa.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato. Arhat. Samma Sanghappa.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Brett.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Michael)**, is a community discussion among Sangha friends exploring core Buddhist concepts in a practical, accessible way. The conversation weaves between personal experience, questions from newcomers, and deeper Dhamma explanations.

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and progression:

### **Core Themes & Teachings**

1.  **The Path as Satisfaction & Relinquishment:** The central, recurring instruction is that the essence of the path is **cultivating satisfaction with things as they are, here and now**. This satisfaction starves craving (tanha) of its fuel. The path is framed not as acquiring bliss, but as the relief of putting down burdens (boulders) of dissatisfaction, clinging, and selfishness.

2.  **Attachment vs. Love:** A significant portion addresses a newcomer's question about attachment in relationships. The group clarifies that **attachment (upadana)** refers to the static mental image or concept we create of a person (or ourselves), not the person themselves. Letting go of attachment means freeing the relationship from selfish clinging, control, and fixed expectations, allowing for love that is more selfless, patient, and focused on the other's happiness.

3.  **Practical Application in Daily Life:** The discussion tackles the common challenge of maintaining mindful satisfaction in active daily life (e.g., at work) versus in seated meditation. Using analogies like **detox/rehab for an addict** and **practicing a musical instrument**, the group explains that seated practice is the "controlled setting" to train the mind, which then must be gradually applied amidst the "triggers" and complexity of the world.

4.  **The Nature of the Self:** The talk begins with the observation that we manifest different "selves" or behavior patterns in different contexts (with parents, at work). This fluidity points to the constructed nature of identity. The **first fetter, identity view (sakkaya-ditthi)**, is identified as a major obstacle to change because we cling to a fixed self-image.

5.  **The Framework of the Path:** The **Four Noble Truths** and the **Noble Eightfold Path** are repeatedly referenced as the essential map. The discussion highlights:
    *   Viewing all questions and problems through the lens of "Is there dissatisfaction (dukkha) here?"
    *   Understanding **right samadhi** as the unification of all eight path factors coming together, not just formal sitting.
    *   The **three lower fetters** (identity view, attachment to rites/rules, doubt) as the primary obstacles to awakening.

### **Key Analogies & Practical Instructions**

*   **Detox & Rehab:** Secluded meditation is like detox from the "intoxication" of habitual craving. Re-entering daily life is like leaving rehab, where old triggers can cause relapse, requiring continued practice.
*   **Putting Down Boulders:** Happiness on the path is the relief of relinquishing burdens of dissatisfaction, not acquiring new states.
*   **Practicing the Violin:** You must start practicing in a quiet room (seated meditation) before you can perform while moving (mindfulness in activity).
*   **Spotting Mara:** Doubt, discouragement ("this is disheartening"), and craving are personified as **Mara**. The instruction is to recognize them ("I see you, Mara") as manifestations of the Second Noble Truth and return to satisfaction.

### **Flow of the Conversation**

1.  **Opening:** A light-hearted discussion on having different "selves" in different contexts leads to a technical point about the path sequence in the suttas.
2.  **Engaging Newcomers:** The host explicitly checks in with newcomers (**Tora, Shamile**), creating space for beginner questions.
3.  **Core Q&A:**
    *   **Tora** asks about **attachment in polyamorous relationships**, leading to a deep dive on love vs. clinging.
    *   **Shamile** asks about the **difficulty of practicing in daily life vs. in stillness**, leading to the detox and violin analogies.
    *   **Vinay** asks about **applying the practice to work-related stress**, reinforcing the core "be satisfied now" instruction.
4.  **Deeper Dhamma Explanations:** The host (**Michael**) and **Brett** offer structured teachings on:
    *   The Three Lower Fetters as obstacles to change.
    *   The difference between hindrance-doubt and fetter-doubt.
    *   The role of jhanas (as relinquishment, not acquisition).
5.  **Closing:** The talk ends with a reminder of the core practice—returning to satisfaction—and well-wishes.

### **Overall Tone & Approach**

The talk exemplifies a **practical, non-dogmatic, and community-oriented approach** to Dhamma. Complex sutta concepts are translated into everyday experience and psychological insight. The emphasis is on direct application ("be satisfied now") over metaphysical speculation, perfectly reflecting the host's admiration for **Dhammarato's** method of teaching. The atmosphere is supportive, with experienced practitioners guiding newcomers while exploring questions together.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and the challenges of practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1. **The Self as a Shapeshifter / Algorithm**
   - **Speaker A** compares how we act differently with different people (e.g., around parents vs. at work) to an algorithm turning on. This illustrates the conditioned, context-dependent nature of identity.

2. **Attachment as a Static Mental Image (Photograph)**
   - **Speaker A** uses the example of looking at a photograph of yourself and thinking, “That’s not me,” to explain how we create fixed mental images of ourselves and others. Letting go of attachment means releasing these static concepts to engage with dynamic reality.

3. **Craving and Addiction Recovery (Detox & Rehab)**
   - **Speaker A** compares formal meditation practice to **detox** and the integration of practice into daily life to **rehab**. The world is full of “triggers” (people, situations) that pull us back into old habits, just as in addiction recovery.

4. **Carrying and Putting Down Boulders**
   - **Speaker A** describes the path as putting down boulders we’ve been carrying. The relief of putting them down is the happiness we seek, not something we acquire. The Buddha’s teachings lure us into letting go of burdens.

5. **Practicing Like Learning an Instrument (Violin)**
   - **Speaker D** compares meditation practice to learning the violin. You start seated in a quiet room (formal practice) before you can play while moving or in conversation (daily life).

6. **The Mind as a Wild Animal Tied to a Post**
   - **Speaker A** references a sutta analogy: the mind, like a wild animal tied to a post, thrashes at first but eventually settles down. This illustrates how meditation (using a neutral object like the breath) calms the mind.

7. **Mara as the Personification of Craving**
   - **Speaker A** and **B** discuss **Mara** (often depicted as a tempter or demon in Buddhism) as a metaphor for the **Second Noble Truth**—the cause of suffering. Mara’s three daughters represent greed, hatred, and delusion.

8. **The Fish and the Frog (Understanding by Contrast)**
   - **Speaker A** uses the analogy of a fish (never dry) and a frog (knows wetness by experiencing dryness) to explain how experiencing *jhāna* (meditative absorption) allows insight into ordinary mental states by contrast.

9. **The Bramble/Thicket of Views**
   - **Speaker A** and **B** refer to speculative questions and rigid opinions as a **thicket of views** or a **quagmire** that distracts from the core issue of *dukkha* (suffering).

10. **Love Without Attachment (Jedi Reference)**
    - **Speaker B** briefly references Jedi (from *Star Wars*) to humorously illustrate the ideal of loving without selfish clinging.

### **Stories / Anecdotes**

1. **Returning to Parents and Regressing to Childhood Role**
   - **Speaker A** shares a relatable story: when visiting parents after a long time, you often fall back into old child-parent dynamics, “performing the pattern of behavior that they expect.” This story illustrates how context triggers different “selves.”

2. **The Heroin Addict’s Triggers and Relapse**
   - **Speaker A** expands the addiction metaphor into a story about triggers (people, places, stress) causing relapse, paralleling how daily life challenges can disrupt meditative calm.

3. **Monks Meditating for Decades Without Progress**
   - **Speaker A** mentions seeing monks who have meditated for 20–50 years but still grapple with basic questions, illustrating the pitfall of attachment to rites and rituals (one of the **fetters**) without genuine insight.

4. **Cultural Differences in Child-Rearing (Thailand vs. US)**
   - **Speaker A** shares an observation from Thailand, where people freely hold others’ children, contrasting it with US norms. This story highlights how attachment to cultural “shoulds” (another **fetter**) varies and can be released.

5. **Byron Katie’s Inquiry (“Can you be absolutely certain it’s true?”)**
   - **Speaker D** references the modern teacher Byron Katie’s method of questioning beliefs, aligning it with examining the narratives that keep us dissatisfied.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist principles—like non-self, attachment, conditioning, and the path to liberation—concrete, relatable, and memorable, especially for newcomers in the conversation.
