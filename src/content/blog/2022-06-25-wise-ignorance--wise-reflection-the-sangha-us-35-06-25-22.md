### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There's a question that's come up a little bit, and sometimes it's the form of a doubt, and sometimes it feels like a worthwhile investigation. The question is of Essentially acquiring information. The difference— I'll do a little outlining. So that's Buddha Dasa talks about in.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** Handbook for Mankind. He gives an example of the one who is completely satisfied. If a lightning bolt struck behind him, he would not be curious because there isn't that threat to his life. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but it's a lightning bolt. It's struck, it's not dangerous because it's already struck, it's done its energy, it missed you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and the restlessness is thinking there's some benefit to figuring it out after it happened when there is.

**Speaker C:** Another example that I have actually seen based upon back to what we were talking about of the video shots, the equivalent of a one-liner in video, and that is to see the Ukrainian soldier walking across the field and a huge weapon, whatever, goes off about 10 paces behind him. Dirt, mud, everything slung in the air, great big explosion, and he doesn't even bother to turn around or change his gait.

**Speaker D:** Why?

**Speaker C:** Because that one didn't get him. Why should he worry about it? Okay, so the thing about lightning, though, is that's a fairly rare event. But in regard to the warfare, we have the slings and arrows of outrageous things happening to us individually on a regular basis. Near misses, hundreds of thousands of near misses. And we pay attention to that as if they actually hit us. Okay. An example of that is the teenage boy sees the bullies turning the corner at school. And before the bully even sees this kid, this kid is already afraid of the bully. He's already acting afraid. In fact, he's behaving in a way that the bully is going to catch that and then attack him. That in fact, if he had seen the bully before the bully sees him, he can take some sort of smart evasive action, like turn around and pretend like you're going into this guy's locker. Or to walk into another room or just turn around and walk in the same direction that the bully is walking. But now you're 30 or 50 feet ahead of him. Hmm. Rather than freezing, waiting for him to come up. OK, so this that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking about, these, these near misses, if we are aware of them, that in fact lightning isn't instant, but there is an event that happens that has a process. And so it's fairly quick. But the point is, is that we can hear it as it's happening, just like that Ukrainian soldier probably knew that that missile was coming. You can hear those things coming. But he also was trained well enough to know that the sound of it indicated that it wasn't coming directly towards him. In other words, he probably knew that he was safe before that shell landed because he was paying attention. And so this is the way that we can begin to open our awareness Here's also another way of speaking at it, is that it almost became kind of a game, not an intense game, but occasionally the game was between Ajaan Po and I, can I sneak up on him? Because that's the game that he was playing, was can he sneak up on me? And yes, he could. That was part of the training of me just being standing there, and he would walk up behind me and say something, a one-liner generally. In fact, the one that he said mostly was Tathagata, which meant, hey dude, wake up, be here now. I was able to come right up to you and you didn't even know it. And so, this also fits in with many, many practices that are known, like for instance, the Zen stick. The whole point about the Zen stick is for the students to wake up before they get hit, and make enough movement for the teacher to know, or the Zen master to know that he's there, so that he doesn't get hit. That the Zen master is only going to be hitting people who don't pay attention to what's going on. This is also very true in— because Zen is very closely related to martial arts. If you're not watching what's going on, you're going to get hit. And so this is a major thing that seems to be missing generally in Western Buddhism, because the Buddhists in the West tend to think that all meditation means going deep. All right, going deep into your own mind as opposed to being in the present moment. Be here now. Watch what your mind is doing on the surface, that you don't have to go deep. I got a puppy here that's biting my feet and Let me close the door to save my toes.

**Speaker E:** You skillfully handled that unwholesome thought. Dhammarato, that puppy, you skillfully handled that unwholesome thought. That unwholesome thought was biting your toes.

**Speaker C:** Uh-huh. Uh, yes, um, uh, we have a, uh, I think she's about 7 weeks old now. Um, seems to be a, uh, Jack Russell Terrier cross. And, uh, I've been around a lot of puppies in my life, and I know that they bite and chew on everything, but this kid She is a non-give-up pistol. I mean, I can take her. One thing that I did while we were talking was that I actually kicked that poor puppy about 5 or 6 feet and she landed on her feet running back, grabbed my foot again. Oh my God. And that Kitty has been quite rough with her because Kitty's a child. When the puppy bites, it hurts. And she will slap the puppy around. She knocked the kid off the bed, all right across the room, and that did not slow that pup down any. It's something that's in the genes of this dog. I've been around alphas before, but I've got a super alpha right now. It's also interesting to watch her with the other dogs. Christopher, good to see you.

**Speaker E:** Hey Christopher, hello.

**Speaker C:** So anyway, uh, we don't really have a topic yet. Christopher, do you have something that you'd like to talk about today?

**Speaker D:** Uh, no, I just wanted to hop in because I haven't been in in a while, so.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I figured I'd restate the answer you gave me and see if that understanding makes sense. The question on restlessness, that it seems like there's sometimes that sort of— I've seen this in my experience, some sort of niggle of needing to know something that I'm not going to be safe unless I learn it. This could be with an academic topic or even in a situation where I'm out and about and there's something that's in my perception and there's the feeling of needing to know in some way. Sometimes the attention just goes automatically because there's movement, and other times there's the observation, then the sort of dissatisfaction related to it, and then Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** All right, so what we're really now talking about is the issue of inadequate information to come to a conclusion. Okay, we have inadequate information to come to a conclusion, and that actually then would be ignorance, or actual ignorance, because we know that we don't know enough. And so that we can process that, one of the ways of processing not having enough data is to go and do some research. And sometimes that means that we've got to wait, like to set up an experiment. If you want to know something. But normally what we do as humans is, is that because we're impatient, we'll say that all the adequate— the information that I have is adequate enough for me to come to a conclusion. And so we then come to a conclusion and the conclusion we come to is wrong. But because we came to that conclusion and it's wrong, it's my conclusion. And so we will stick with my conclusions even though they're wrong. And the wiser thing to do is to recognize that when we don't know something, that we don't know it, and that's OK. So doubt is different than this kind of ignorance. We can call it now three kinds of ignorance. We have wise ignorance. The ignorance means that I do not know, and I know that I do not know, and that I'm comfortably happy not knowing. And if the information that I need comes, then I will know that when it does come. So that's one kind of ignorance, wise ignorance. The second kind of ignorance is the kind that we normally have, and that is delusional ignorance. Oh, well, I think I know. Here's my opinion, and we grab and cling to our opinions about things. Even when new information comes by, we'll throw out the new information because I've already got enough information, enough information to form an opinion, and my opinion is all I care about, not the facts. This is delusional thinking, and this is most— this is the most common kind. And then there is the other kind, the third kind, which we would call doubt, in the sense that I don't know, I know I don't know, but I really need to know. Okay, this is when it becomes a hindrance. I need to know rather than, oh, I don't know and I don't need to know, I'll just sit around and be happy while I don't know. So we can begin to look at these kinds of things within our own behavior to see which of these three do we have, because it's actually a choice. Not having the correct information is not our choice. We don't have that choice. Then in fact, that's been basically the evolution of humanity in the past 10,000 years, is coming from not knowing things into knowing. And there's been a long bloody trail in there in between because people didn't know but thought that they did. A clear example of that is a preemptive strike. Hello, Scott.

**Speaker B:** Hello.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Scott.

**Speaker A:** Hey.

**Speaker C:** A preemptive strike then means that, oh, I had better attack the enemy because if I don't attack I attack him, he probably will attack me. And both sides have that mentality to where, in fact, they could sit down and have dinner together if they had a different mentality. But we will strike out of protection. Then, in fact, you can see that that's what Putin has done. Putin is striking the Ukraine out of fear that the NATO is encroaching upon him. And so that's that kind of delusional thinking that I had better do something. I don't know what's going on, but I'd better go do something. I better go find out. So this is the kind of doubt then that as meditators, that's the kind that we generally need to deal with. To recognize that just because I don't know doesn't mean that one, that I have to make something up to feel better or to go get the right information in order to feel better, that I can just leave the data to present itself when it's needed, or when not when it's needed, but when it presents itself, and that we can wait until then. That we don't need to go and act right away, because almost always the actions that will be taken, we would like to withdraw them, that they're not really— that's not the right thing to do. So we will act out of fear, we will act out of doubt, we will act out of ignorance, but we don't know that our ignorance is the problem. So, we will become deluded. And that one of the delusions that we have, in fact, one of the kinds of delusions that we have, the most common delusion, is the things that we were told. We have been lied to. Our whole society is based upon ownership and control. An agency, and that we all seem to think that if we find some information that we own it. This is what we mean in the sense of actually legislation. We have copyright laws and patents and the whole idea of ownership of data and information. And Asia's mentality is that information is not owned. It's kind of funny in Thailand that there's been three major events that have happened. One happened with CDs, another one happened with tobacco, and a third one happened with software. Okay, the CDs and the DVDs, when that market hit and that it was possible to manufacture CDs by stamping them out so that it's actually very cheap to make CDs and DVDs. And once they get to the presses, they can just stamp everything. And so in the 1980s and '90s, the streets of Bangkok were literally covered with stalls that sold all kinds of every piece of music that was available on the music scene that had a DVD. There was a copy of that DVD somewhere on this city block in Bangkok. And the Hollywood movie industry hated that because they couldn't make any money off of it. Now, the question is, who owns that CD? Is the Asian mentality. Who made the CD? That's who owns the CD. In the West, they say, I don't care about the CD, I own the information on that CD, I own the music. And you can see that that begins to gain cultural clashes. The same thing happened with software, that in fact, if I buy a computer in Thailand It will have Windows, probably Windows 10 on it still. And right down to the bottom of the screen, it says this Windows is not authorized. You need to go get an authorization for it. Well, guess what? I've got two servers that have been running, one of them running for more than a year, has never been authorized. And not only that, but because it's not authorized, I don't have to put up with Microsoft or Windows at all. The updates don't work. That means I've got a stable system. I don't have to get any new updates. Also, I don't get any advertisements from them. They don't know who it is, OK, because it's just a blind unauthorized version of Windows, but it works perfectly well for any and everything that we want. I would say probably about 2/3 of all the Windows in Thailand on the laptops and PCs all over the place in big businesses, small businesses, all of them have that little shadow thing in the corner saying this Windows is not authorized. But in the United States, how many of you have ever seen an unauthorized version of Windows notice on your screen? Not do it.

**Speaker B:** Why?

**Speaker C:** Because the laptop manufacturers there play by Western rules. Here in Thailand, they don't play by Western rules, they play by Asian rules. So that's a very interesting point. Who owns the information? And that's in the West, they have the idea that ownership and control of information, of data, and in the Asian mentality, it's ownership and control of the media. Of the data, the physical object, not the data itself. If we can take that— yes, somebody had a question. Never mind. Okay, so we can actually take that and to understand that because information is kind of important in the West, then that means that the people who believe information is important are easily controllable. People who are awake and aware of what's going on around them and can see what's going on, they don't think about the data that they don't know, whether it's valuable or not. In other words, if out of sight, out of mind, if I don't know it— we also have the idea that ignorance is bliss. Have you ever heard of that phrase, ignorance is bliss? Yeah. How many of you will find people arguing, no, that's not true, ignorance is dangerous?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, ignorance is suffering.

**Speaker C:** Well, it depends upon what kind of ignorance. If it is wise ignorance, then is bliss. If it is delusional ignorance, it may be dangerous. And if it is doubtful ignorance, then it's guaranteed to be dangerous.

**Speaker E:** So wise ignorance is, I don't know, I know I don't know, and I can be happy with not knowing.

**Speaker C:** Well, and I don't give a flying rip.

**Speaker B:** Don't know, don't care.

**Speaker C:** Don't know and don't care.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker E:** And then delusional ignorance is I think I know and basically don't entertain any other kind of knowing. Like my answer is the one that's correct, right?

**Speaker C:** You could see that kind of thing in one of the little clips that I have seen on YouTube is there's a couple of guys, a team that go around to events like Trump rallies and interview people and listen to the way that the people talk, in the sense of, though I have not been watching the January 6th things, I don't need to watch it because I don't need any data. My mind is made up. My mind is made up. Don't give me any facts.

**Speaker E:** Hmm.

**Speaker F:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** This is very, very common in Western world because we think that data is important and therefore the data that I have is important, even if it's false, it's still important. It's my view, it's my ideas. This is what I believe. And don't give me any reality.

**Speaker A:** So any belief, any investigation about reality is just a hypothesis. And even the Four Noble Truths is just a hypothesis that we've tested again and again and again. We found realistic and based on reality, right?

**Speaker C:** Exactly, that's it. That we can test it, testing it over and over and over again. Then in fact, in that regard, we could say that we should endeavor to stay wisely ignorant and continue to look, to continue to gather data. Whatever data is there, we can gather that up, but we don't have to add data that doesn't exist in order to come to a conclusion, because we do not like being confused. How many of you like actually being confused? Nobody likes it. Why is it fun?

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, it's like, let's say like something really strange is happening and you're confused, but it's like kind of entertaining how like strange it is. Or like, like you may be confused about Like, because there's so much information going on that you're confused about all the information going on. You know what I'm trying to say? It's like, I guess that wouldn't be confusion, but that would be like, more like awe or like wonder. It's more like wonder than confusion, I guess.

**Speaker C:** Like, okay, like what?

**Speaker B:** Like when you're in awe or wonder, like, you don't really know, like, you don't have like a grasp on things per se. So in a sense, you could be confused.

**Speaker C:** We have words like that. One of the words that we have would be amazing. Have you ever heard amazing? Amazing. Do you know what the word actually means? Do you know what amaze is?

**Speaker A:** Like a maze.

**Speaker C:** A maze. Yeah. Sometimes they'll put a maze in a park with big bushes and you get caught in the maze. Okay. So amazing actually means that you're stuck in something and you can't find your way out. But the underlying part of it is the need to know. If it's actually dangerous, and in other words, if there was also a tiger or a gorilla or maybe Russian armed forces in the maze that I'm caught in, then I really would like to get out of that maze. Or maybe like Homer Simpson, just kind of melt into the maze. So I understand what you're saying, Scott. There is some kinds of information that we can be at wonder with and that that's okay. An example, I can give you several examples. One is that there are certain sports games, baseball, football, whatever, and right up to the last minute everyone is still in their seats, right up to the very last instant. And then there are other sport games when two-thirds of the fans have already left before the game's over. Why is that? Because they're not amazing? Well, because they're no longer amazed. They know who's going to win. The score has already shown who's going to win this. There is no more doubt about who's going to win. Therefore, there is no reason to hang around. What a good— and then in fact, there may be some several very spectacular shots that are happening at the end of the game, and very few people saw it because they had already decided that the game was over. All right, another example of that would be both movies and books or novels. That why do people read the whole novel? Why do people watch the whole movie? And in fact, the way that I watch movies is I'll watch the beginning of the movie, I'll cycle through, get a bit of Piti in the middle of it, and then I'll watch the end of the movie. And I can do a movie in 3 to 5 minutes. Don't take me 2 hours to watch a movie.

**Speaker E:** Is it because they don't know what's going to happen and they need to know? So it's— and not only that, but.

**Speaker C:** A lot of it is false. The reason that I watch the beginning of the movie is so that I can check out who the heroines are, who the who the heroes and the heroines and the villains are. And then I go to the end of the movie to prove that I was right, because all of them are that way. Think about it, that even in cliffhangers, they don't like a big— here's several examples. One of them was The Sopranos and how it ended, and the other one was Superman. The death of Superman. Superman wasn't supposed to die. Is he still alive? They do still that with Elvis Presley and other things like that. Oh, you're not supposed to have a tragic ending. You're supposed to have a hero won the game. And so we don't like it when something bad happens or is not expected. One example, The King's Men. Anagami was a movie that I saw some of, and in the beginning, the young hero was introduced, and then his dad was introduced, and then the hero was killed. And they're not supposed to do that in a movie; you're not supposed to kill the hero. It turns out that it was his dad that was the hero, but his dad wouldn't have been motivated to do what he was doing without his son getting killed in the war, so that he goes and becomes the king's man. OK, so these are the kind of things that are set up like that. But you still always have a hero if you know that that's going to happen or that it's going to be a cliffhanger. You know what a cliffhanger is? And they started that in the 1920s when they had The Perils of Pauline and other things like that. And to get the people to come to the movie next week, they would have Pauline in great peril, but they didn't knock her off. They didn't kill her. They just left her in grave danger. And now you got to go see what happened. What happened? What happened?

**Speaker E:** Right, right.

**Speaker C:** Guess what? They have done what now? 9— 8 or 9 Star Wars, all of them ending in a cliffhanger. Yeah. Getting ready for the next one. So now that we're beginning to understand this, we can begin to see that much of this mentality that we have was a learned mentality, that in Asia they learned a mentality about property and ownership and information and all of that. But in the West, information has value. It has sometimes a monetary value to it. And because of that, we highly prize information. Westerners, Americans will look down on all— well, Thailand is not nearly as economically or scientifically advanced as Americans, and that's the criteria that they use. And they don't recognize that the average village person in Thailand is much better off in his life than your average Westerner, because the average Thai is OK with what's happening today. He goes to his field and he does a little bit and he pleases his animals and he's having a ball. And Westerners are saying, I got to know, I got to know, I got to know. I got to find out. If I get enough information, I'll be enlightened. And so we look at— go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker B:** When you're talking about Star Wars, it made me think of a conversation I was having with my mom when we were watching Star Wars. It's like Star Wars is like a really good example of like the idea of good versus evil, right? So I wanted to know what you think about the whole concept of good and evil, and what are the implications of that? And like, is there such a thing as evil? Like, or is it just nature? Is it just all a natural The.

**Speaker C:** Only thing that I know that's actually evil is that question. That in fact, it's important for us to begin to see that good and evil are concepts, they're values. Judgments, and that they're almost always based upon our feelings of liking and not liking. That if I like something, then I think that, oh, I will like it next time. It makes me feel good right now. It'll make me feel good later. Therefore, I want it in the vicinity of me so that I can get my pleasure from it at any time. This is where ownership comes in. I've got to own that girl. That beautiful girl makes me feel so so good, I gotta have her, I gotta own her, I gotta prove to myself that she's mine. Okay, so, uh, that ownership then has more delusions built into it. So the first delusion is, I like it, is just a feeling. That's basically coming out of biology, but it is also— I have a lot of delusional things to it. In other words, if you already see that Donald Trump, for instance, as a criminal, then when you see him telling a lie, it's kind of like, oh, there he goes again. I got that one. Or it could be that dirty criminal. I hate him. And then somebody else can hear that lie that he's saying, but they have already an affection for Donald Trump. And so they'll either let him get away with it or worse still, they'll believe the lie. Even though the lie has no evidence to back it up and probably a lot of evidence that goes against it. But they will not take the evidence because they like the guy or they like something. Okay. So our liking and our disliking is kind of based upon delusion of where did we get our liking and our not liking. And then the next point is, is that if we— and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about this— is that if we have wisdom at the point of contact, if we know why we like something and what the value of it is, etc., like that, then we can make wise decisions about how we feel. But normally we don't. We normally do things out of habit, which would also mean out of ignorance and out of delusion. So if I like that, whatever it is, that object, Then I want it. Now the real delusions comes in, in the sense of, oh, I need it. I'm now incomplete. Before I even saw that thing, I was OK. But now that I see it, I like it, I want it, I've got to have it. You can see the little kid sitting in the grocery cart and the kids just having fun watching up and down. And mom makes the huge mistake of taking the kid down the cereal aisle. And now the kid sees that box of what, Post Toasties or Tony the Tiger or whatever it is. And now that he sees it, I want it, I've got to have it. And that 2-year-old, 3-year-old child then makes the decision right there. I am not good enough without Post Toasties. I've got to have it. Now, Mom is wise. She's going to give that box of Post Toasties to the kid. And tell him, you can carry this box of Post Toasties around the store, but when we check out, it's going to stay in the store. But you can have it right now. But most moms are not smart enough to pull that kind of trick. And so there's going to be a scene I've actually seen. So it gets so bad that the mom will actually leave the aisle that that child is in with that basket screaming about those Post Toasties, and mom doesn't know how to handle it, and she takes a hike. She'll go someplace else. She tries to get away from the child. OK, so now we set that up. This is how we all operate. We like something and we think that we will be better off if we can get it, that somehow we're not good enough. Yeah, that leads then to, oh, well, if it is going to improve me, then it is an improvement. Therefore, it must be good. If I like it, it is something that I want and desire and it is good. And if I I don't like it, that means it's evil. The knowledge of good and evil is not done wisely. It's done out of feeling, ignorant feelings. I like it, I want it, it must be good. I don't like it, it must be bad, it's evil. So this is where evil and good come from. Now, that's not at all the same question as, let us say, kusala and akusala, or wholesome and unwholesome, nor is it at all like appropriate and non-appropriate. Then in fact, one of the ways that we kind of look at evil— you even asked the question, is there anything that is inherently evil. Anything actually has a constituent component that makes it inherently evil. In other words, you're asking about the meaning of life. Does life itself have any meaning to it? And the answer is only what you feel. If you feel, and you feel ignorantly, then you will make ignorant decisions about how important things are. And if you feel and allow yourself to feel and then feel wisely, you can have a beautiful life because you're not judging things as good or bad or evil or whatnot. You're just looking at it in the sense of is this appropriate? Right now.

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** So how to feel wisely? How to interrupt this chain of going from liking to wanting to needing to gotta having?

**Speaker C:** Well, we can back up one more step into Piti, Anapanasati, back to— because I mentioned wisdom at the point of contact when something contacts us. That's the time to wake up to how do we actually feel, to recognize I like this or I don't like it. That's the way to start, okay? To actually— that thought narrative, to recognize that I do like something, get in touch with these feelings directly. We're not talking about emotions. How emotions are the kind of feelings we have ignorantly. But if we have feelings wisely, then those feelings are not emotions. They're ahas.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** That I see that basically.

**Speaker E:** Is it basically so when something comes up and there's a sense of liking it and you are seeing that at the point of contact and you look into it, you see into it further than what we're really trying to do is understand what that feeling is, to create more intimacy with that feeling, right? Rather than take it as face value, take it as— rather than take it as a fact, we're trying to understand what it actually is.

**Speaker C:** Precisely. And so this, in a way, is exactly opposite of what what people think of when they talk about suppressing your feelings or suppressing your emotions, and that that's somehow a bad thing and that you're supposed to let it out. This is possibly one of the most important lies that psychology has ever told, is that you've got to express your feelings. Well, what they're looking at is the situation to where someone is boiling inside, feeling really, really upset, uptight, angry. And his only choice is to either spew that anger and hatred all over the place or just continue to let it bottle up. And eventually it will explode. Right. And so they say, well, we need a relief valve to let the pressure off. Well, what we're doing here is we're backing up to the point of saying, wait a minute, the pressure came because of heat, that we need to look at where the heat is before it becomes pressure. In other words, before we get into a state of feeling in the sense of emotional. And by the way, the emotional always has to do with need. We've gone too far. We're way into it. In fact, this is where good and evil lies. Is way too late. But if we could back it up to just to the point of liking— I like it, I don't like it— and stay with that, the next step after that can be then to recognize how or why do I like what I see. And the answer to that will be one of two possibilities. One is, is that it comes directly out of the DNA. It comes directly out of our instincts, or it can be learned behavior. In other words, it came out of somebody else's instincts. This is the way that we can begin to see where do our feelings come from. In other words, why do we like those slender young women when a fat old woman has all of the same equipment? In fact, she's got even more equipment and probably some knowledge. You'd be better off with a fat old woman than you would with that skinny young woman. But our instincts tell us that it should be the young, slender woman. And also that it's society, because here's something very funny.

**Speaker B:** Anagami.

**Speaker C:** You guys probably don't know this, but if you ever have a chance of watching a Bollywood movie, you know what Bollywood is? That comes from Bombay. It's the Hollywood industry in India. All the heroes and heroines in Bollywood movies are fat. Their movie star celebrities in India are fat, overweight, would not be considered beautiful by American standards at all. And in fact, neither is their music. Have you ever heard Indian music? You don't like it. You know why? Because it doesn't fit the 12-tone scale that we have in our Western mentality about what music is supposed to sound like. OK, so we can actually now begin to understand that beauty may not be directly involved deep into our genes, but rather the beauty is the lies that we've been told by the as a society, that we could go so far as to say that the major teaching of the Buddha— okay, Scott, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, in terms of like, uh, attraction, um, there has to be a big genetic component because you're going to want to pick, uh, someone more fit to carry offspring.

**Speaker C:** So, but so— Oh wow, that's very intellectual. You sound like a philosopher writing a book right now. We're not talking about that kind of intellectual stuff. We're talking about kind of feelings, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, that like, yeah, that's what leads to like, uh, reproducing. I mean, I'm talking about like back, you know, just like, guess what, here.

**Speaker C:** And I don't know about all cultures. I haven't been to all cultures, nor would I be welcome to do this kind of research. But I would say based upon society and what I see, that in Western culture, 99% of sex has nothing to do with procreation. Yeah, for sure. Not at all. In fact, most of the sex has to do— to have the sex and to avoid the procreation, to where the original intention of sex was to have more babies. And yet, how many of you actually look at that girl and say, wow, she's going to make a great baby factory? You don't think that. No, it has to do with the, um, uh, the some features and some design, uh, points that indicate, uh, something in your past. In other words, if your society is, um, well, let's say it this way. If the society is very, very heavily, deeply into makeup and every girl's gotta be on in public, has got to wear makeup, makeup, but the women in your family don't wear makeup. They poo-poo makeup. There's no makeup in the house. And that child, when he goes out on the street, when he sees women all made up, he'll look at that and see, oh, I see makeup.

**Speaker E:** Hmm.

**Speaker C:** But the other kid in that community, but his family is all— and his wife, I mean his mother and his sisters and everybody's just all dolled up with all the makeup that they can pack on, then when he goes out in public and sees makeup, he says, 'My, that girl is beautiful,' and he doesn't even see the girl. All he sees is the paint job. Can't see the girl. There's nothing there for him to see because he is actually looking for what he has been told to look for in beauty. So if we could begin to do this, we can begin to recognize, oh, I like that girl. Wow, she's drop-dead gorgeous, but I don't want her. I can like something and not want it. If I like it and want it, now I'm going to slide downhill into, you know, getting my cell phone out and making dates and all kinds of things and going to pharmacies and, you know, that rigmarole. So the whole idea is, is that if we can catch it at the point of contact and recognize my feelings are based upon either biology within or someone else's biology, then we can back it up one step. And this is where we're going to now, is the issue of the Salyatana. Why, when you saw the girl, did you like her? Why, when you saw that car, did you like it? What kind of thoughts were you having, etc., like that, that indicated that that car is beautiful? I mean, I really, really like that big burn spot on the hood, and I really like the rips in the furniture, the seats. I mean, it looks like the dog has chewed up the 'Gosh, this is a really beautiful car.' Okay, we don't think about it like that. We're looking at it in the sense of it's supposed to be beautiful because it's supposed to look new. It's supposed to look beautiful because it's new. We like something when it's new. An example of that: have you ever manufactured something when you were a kid, or done something, maybe whittled on a stick. And as you're whittling, you really like the results. This is beautiful. I like this whittle that I've done. But then later you set that stick down and you never feel that way about it again. It's only when it's new. This is also with new relationships. When you meet somebody new, you get really eager about it. It. So where does this idea that things that are new are desirable and things that are old are undesirable— why is that? Is it because of our culture? These are the things that we need to look at inside of our mind. Why do I like that? What is it that puts that there? And now we're beginning to look at how we perceive things. What kind of data did I use when I perceived this object as beautiful. There's the concept of.

**Speaker F:** Diminishing returns, and also in general that repetitiveness gets boring.

**Speaker C:** Ah, repetitiveness does not necessarily get boring. Repeating something over and over again and not watching what you're doing, that's boring. Doing the same thing over and over again does not necessarily mean that something is going to be boring. How many of you've gotten bored with tasting food? How many of you've gotten bored with breathing? No, we don't get bored with some things that we repeat over and over and over again. And in fact, breathing is life-giving, and that we know that. We may not pay much attention to it, but it would be wise if we did, to pay attention to the breathing, because you're going to be doing it over and over and over again. OK, but if we— in fact, one of the things about the repetitive— have you ever heard it in this way. It gets old. That's the phrase. Okay, this is getting old. Why? Because it's the same thing over and over again. Guess what? Something that's happening over and over and over again doesn't necessarily wear out. Physical objects will wear out, but a lot of stuff can happen over and over and over again and it doesn't wear out. You get strong from it instead. And so we can actually practice Anapanasati this way also, is that in fact we want to, let us say, gain pleasure out of the repetition. We can actually train ourselves to get pleasure out of the repetition to where the normal way of doing it is, is that we get bored with it. I mean, the one of the biggest jokes or long-lasting jokes that you've heard is going into a meditation sitting, waiting for the bell to ring. How many of you have actually done that, waited for the bell to ring? Why? Well, you're waiting for the bell to ring because you want to get over with. Why? Because your meditation has gotten old, boring. And this is the way that we normally practice. We practice that way and then we do it too much. And what is too much? Well, it's no longer pleasurable. In fact, meditation can be downright evil because we don't like it. We don't like it because we're not paying attention. That if we actually paid attention to this breath, wow, this is really life-giving. This is another breath. One of the things, in fact, that I wanted to mention to you is the idea about making sure that your nasal passages are clear, that it is uncomfortable to breathe when the nose is stopped up. Right. Makes sense, doesn't it? So check it right now. Check to see, is your nasal passages open right now so that you can breathe freely? And in fact, just then when I breathed in, I could feel just a little bit of mucus in there, and so we can clean that out. And now I can breathe even better than I did. OK, so with that, that's pleasurable to clean the mucus out and to be able to breathe well feels really, really delightful. And so we can practice doing that on a regular basis throughout our sitting. How's the breathing? Is it open? Is it comfortable? Is it clear? And then we do something to do it. It really, really feels such a relief to clear out congestion so that you can breathe with both. And you can do that even if you've got a cold or stopped up. You can in fact do things that can get it cleaned out. We have medications like antihistamines. You can put salt water In fact, there's an old Indian technique where you have the salty water. Warm, salty water is the absolute best, and you put it into the cup of your hand and then you'll hold your nose with the thumb and breathe in on one side and then hold the nose on the other side and breathe in separately and get that stuff in there. This is exactly— you'd say, well, how could they ever invent that? Well, oceans have been around for literally a long, long time. And you already know that if you go swimming in the ocean that your sinuses get cleaned right out. Have you ever seen that?

**Speaker B:** You can notice you can buy— yeah, when I'm sick I buy this thing at the store. It's like, it's like a saline solution, but it's like a little device that's like you squirt it up your nose and it comes out the other side and it like cleans it out really good. Yeah, so you could, you could buy that like any, like, pharmacy, like, or.

**Speaker C:** You cannot buy that. You've got one of those devices right here at the end of your arm. It's called a hand. Oh, but in our society, you've got to go buy something.

**Speaker B:** It just works better. Like, it's practical.

**Speaker C:** How do you know that it's better? Because it's a squirt.

**Speaker B:** It's like the thing, it's a, it's a pointed nozzle, and you just squirt it straight up. You don't have to like— yeah, you don't have to hold water in your hand, like the water is going to fall out of your hand. But it's— that's difficult.

**Speaker C:** I've never had any problem with water falling out of my hand, but I have right now. If I wanted such device that you're talking about, I would suffer because I don't have one. Oh, there's not one here. I don't even think there's one on the island here. I'd have to go to Bangkok to find one of those things, but I wouldn't have to go to the Hancock to find a hand. I've got one of those right here. But anyway.

**Speaker B:** I'll mail one to you, Dhammarato. I'll send one in the mail.

**Speaker C:** I will suffer until it arrives.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato, can I ask a question?

**Speaker C:** Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Okay, so on the subject of the liking, and we're talking about like, why do I like that? Why do I like that girl? So I recently broke up with my girlfriend and I moved out of the place where we both— That's why we.

**Speaker C:** Haven'T seen you for a couple of weeks. Now we know what you've been doing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so I went to live with my mom, and that was like a big decision.

**Speaker C:** On whose part? Your mom's?

**Speaker E:** No, my decision. It was a mutual decision for both of us to move separate, move into separate places. But, you know, we just basically found out that we broke up, got back together, broke up, got back together. It happened like probably about 5 times, um, toward the end of our relationship.

**Speaker C:** That means you only have another 20 to go.

**Speaker E:** So at some point, I mean, isn't.

**Speaker C:** That what sex is all about? In and out and in and out.

**Speaker B:** And in and out.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so what I wanted to ask about kind of is like Now that I just feel like it was a wholesome decision to finally, like, let it go, to, like, be done with it. Maybe not forever, you know, who knows? But at least for right now, because that's all there is, right? And I find myself sometimes going throughout the day. I mean, we're cordial, we're friendly with each other. So I find myself sometimes going throughout the day You know, wondering if she texted me, I'll check my phone. She'll text me, I wonder if she's gonna like, ask me to come hang out like she did last time and then end up getting back together and then breaking up. And so I get afraid of this cycle starting up. But here's the thing. When I noticed these, these thoughts, these feelings of I like this, or I want this, instead of doing anything about it, I'll just sit here and kind of like try to understand that feeling, like look into it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker E:** But my question is, like you were saying, Dhammarato, how do we know if it's wise feeling or if it's not wise feeling? If she asks me, hey, let's go get breakfast together. And it's like, I don't know, like, how do I know that that would not be wise or that it would be wise other than based on my direct— I mean, obviously it's just my.

**Speaker C:** Direct experience, but you've already given me the key to that in the sense that you said that you let it go and then you start talking about checking yourself on and checking to see if she's called you and all of that, which indicates that you haven't let it go, not yet. Yeah, yeah, that's what I was meaning about the in and out and in and out. Neither one of you have let it go yet. Yeah, okay, you haven't let it go yet. So here's what you can do every time that you have a thought of her. Catch that thought and recognize it all. I don't have her now, and that's okay. I can't let her go. I got along without her before I met her, and I'm getting along without her now. That's the real letting go. So you haven't really let go yet. It's more of like the explosion. But the explosion is still happening. The shrapnel hasn't finished yet.

**Speaker E:** I would say you're spot on in some ways, but I also do think like gradually there has been a letting go because it took courage, you know, if I could say, if I could call it that way. It took courage.

**Speaker A:** It took.

**Speaker E:** It really took something to just be like, okay, I'm moving out. You know, it took something to break up 5 times. So, you know, I know what you— it is comical, I know. But I know what you're saying as well. So do we just— would you recommend just not texting even then to not Precisely so.

**Speaker C:** Yes, I would recommend that, and I would recommend even further that when you have a thought of texting her, let that thought go. Yeah, as soon as you have a thought of her, before you even have texting her— see, thought of her and then texting her, and you still haven't let it go, and then you text her, you still haven't let it go. The place to let her go is as soon as you have the thought of her. 'Oh, I don't need to think about her. She's not here now.'.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and I honestly, I really do agree with you. The only conflict with that is that, you know, Dan and I have been talking, and it's weird. It's like in some ways I feel like I can actually be a friend to her because I So long as.

**Speaker C:** You don't want her, you can be friends with her.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, so long as I don't want her. But the wanting, the liking, the wanting comes in and out of just being her friend. So it's—.

**Speaker C:** Wakey wakey. Yes, wakey wakey to that. Wake up to that.

**Speaker E:** Okay, so I'm seeing it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so when you have thoughts of.

**Speaker B:** Her.

**Speaker C:** Say I— she's not here. That's the easy way. If any thought that you have about anything or anyone that's not right here in front of you, you don't need to have that thought. You can— in other words, you can trust yourself that when she is there in front of you, you can handle it correctly. You do not have to get all of your guns and all of your ammunition and all of your readiness to take care of her when she comes. You have the wisdom to handle her unprepared. In other words, we're looking for a better way of preparing, and the better way of preparing is to recognize— bye, Scott— you can handle it the way that it will happen, and that I can let her go right now. I don't have to get all goosed up and ready. Yeah, that I can come back and just enjoy this particular moment right now without her. Wow, what a marvelous moment this is.

**Speaker E:** So then how do I know if it's— when it's appropriate to just be her friend, to go have breakfast with her, if we want to do like—.

**Speaker C:** When she calls you, now she's in your world. Wakey wakey, be careful. But when she's not in your world, when she's not calling you, she's not texting you, then throw her out of the mind. Whenever she comes back into the mind, throw her back out. Say, she's not here right now, I don't need that. And you can hand— you can do anything with that. All the police are not here right now, I don't have to think about how bad the police are. Oh, Donald Trump is not here right now, I don't have to think about Donald Trump. Oh, Putin is not here in my yard. I don't have to worry about what's happening in the Ukraine right now. This is the way of doing it. Okay. And that happens with everything. And it's especially valuable with relationships.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** When they, when they, when they break up, the easy way to handle it is when you recognize that you've got— when she's on your mind, she's heavy. The longer you hold her on your mind, the heavier she's going to get. Your desire is going to build up. But the easy thing to do is just to throw her out as soon as you see her there, as soon as you recognize— go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Okay, I'm with you. I love this, honestly, I do, because this is a different, a little different approach. Um, but what I'm asking about more directly is like on the relative level Do I be friends with her? Do I text her back if she texts me? Do I— I don't know the answer.

**Speaker C:** To that kind of question because she's not texting us right now. Right now she's not here. The only place that that poor girl exists is in your mind, and you don't have to worry about that. But the question is, how do you— how do you answer this text, because when you get a text from her, you still don't have the girl. All you've got are a few words on a cell phone. Okay.

**Speaker E:** She'S gonna text me back.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, wouldn't you say it would be useful to, uh, prepare for a situation you know is going to happen? I mean, So I mean, if he knows she's going to text, wouldn't that be good to anticipate that and be ready for that? I mean, I would personally say don't text her. I mean, if you have issues dealing— like, until you're indifferent, you're, you're stuck. I mean, that's not even a Buddhist thing.

**Speaker C:** Oh, that's exactly right. That's what I'm inviting him to do, is to get, um, what word did you use?

**Speaker D:** Indifferent.

**Speaker C:** Indifferent. Become indifferent right now.

**Speaker A:** Out.

**Speaker C:** As soon as she comes in, throw her out indifferently. Just out. Okay. And when, when a text message comes, all you've got is a text message. You still don't have the girl. This is an important point.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** How do you answer a text message? I don't even know what's in the text message yet. So the asking that kind of question is kind of irrelevant because we don't know the answer to And I also don't know how you will be feeling when she calls you. She— you may get that text message when you're on the bus. You may get that text message when you're on the toilet. You may get that text message when you're eating. I don't know what's happening, so it doesn't matter. But what we can get prepared for is, is that when you do get the text message, you'll be okay. You can handle it.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker E:** But you're not really answering whether or not to have like the view or the attitude of being her friend or not being her friend when she texts me, when I'm engaging with her in that text. Am I her friend or am I—.

**Speaker C:** That's because I do not know what's in that text message. Is it full of knives? Is it full of nooses? That's the whole point, is that you need to learn how to be appropriate in the moment, and I can't tell you about what appropriate means in some moment that we don't have the description of.

**Speaker D:** Okay, wouldn't this be like the Buddhist saying, the, you know, go into seclusion type thing? I mean, like, wouldn't it be better for him to like practice this in his own head rather than with her directly?

**Speaker C:** I mean, I don't— I guess throwing her out of the mind when she's not there is the practice that he needs to throw the desire for her out of the mind when she is there.

**Speaker E:** I think what you're getting at is that the more I practice throwing her out of my mind when she's not here, the more I'll be prepared to deal with her when she's in the mind, when she is there.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, yes, that's exactly it.

**Speaker E:** You're like doing a Zen koan without telling me you're doing a Zen koan. I understand.

**Speaker C:** You caught me.

**Speaker E:** You set me up. I knew it 10 minutes ago, but I was just being stubborn. All right, I can do that.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's the way to do it. Handle it in the moment of getting her out of the mind. And when she is completely out of the mind and then she texts you, she'll— then you can handle that appropriately. But if you're warning and bawling and screaming and what am I going to do, what am I going to do, and then the text message comes Now you're on the kill scene.

**Speaker E:** You're right. No, you're absolutely right, because when you're— when you are under the impression of desire, you can't see clearly. So what we're— they've got a song for that. They do?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's by the Platters, 1953. I can see when your heart's on fire, burning with desires. Smoke gets in your eyes. When your heart's on fire, burning with desire, smoke gets in your eyes. So why don't we get the desire out of the mind? Yeah, let your heart's on fire. See that fire? Put it out. And when you put that fire out and you've got wisdom, there's no smoke in your eyes. When she now calls, you can do— you can handle that. Wisely because you got your eyes open, not full of smoke. Cool, cool. Yes, that's the way. So Christopher, that's your— your answer is absolutely right there. Okay, the way to get ready for her is by getting rid of her in the mind right now so that she's not here, and then there's no more desire. And then you know how to handle it.

**Speaker E:** Thanks for the assist, Christopher.

**Speaker C:** Eric, your hand has been up for a while. Do you still have anything? You're on mute. You're mute. You're mute again.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, now you're on mute.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I was thinking about this case and also when people bring up the topic of wanting to stop smoking, for example, as they want to change some behavior. And in this case, and also in this case of the kid wanting cereal, you advise that people go through the motions but not actually fulfill the want. And I was wondering if there was a sutta related to that. And also, what's the difference in this case with the texting? Like, for example, would it be also viable to write a whole text but then not send it and forget about it? And why would that not be interesting?

**Speaker E:** Appropriate, if at all.

**Speaker C:** Okay, if you have to get something out of your system, that's the way to do it. Then, in fact, that's one of the well-known things about Abraham Lincoln, that after he died, they went through his desk and they found dozens and dozens of dozens of very angry letters that he had written to people, and after he wrote it, he piled it in his drawer. He didn't send them. This is one of the ways of handling it, okay? That if you got something on your mind, yeah, write it down, get it out. In fact, I've actually practiced that. I haven't practiced it in several years, but there have been times when I really needed to get this off my chest. 'Oh, you're a terrible meditation teacher because you charge money.' And I write all of that down, but then I don't write the Anicca because I can see what I'm doing. So if that's how we have to do it, and in fact what we can do when we really let it out, when we write it all down and write those feelings, we can can recognize, hey, I don't want to feel that way. That's not who I am. But if I blurt all of that out in front of someone, then I've gotten— I've done some damage. So writing it down and throwing it out, that's just one way of doing it. We might in fact want to say that to Alex. Yeah, Alex, write her a text message, let her have it, but don't send it to her. Erase that message, because we know it's unwholesome after we've read it. When we're writing it, we think, "Oh, I've got to say this. It's really important that I tell her this." Then after you write it, you recognize, "Wait a minute, this was not the right thing to say. Let's not send that." So yes, that's one of the ways of handling it. But the better way of handling, or let us say a more sophisticated way of handling it, as soon as you get that paper out to write that note, or as soon as you open the email, you can say, wait a minute, I'm not even going to bother to write this stuff down. I'm just going to throw it out of my mind now. And then the next time, before you even sit down to the laptop, You can say, wait a minute, I'm not even going to go to the laptop to write that email. I'm going to throw that stuff out of the mind right now. Okay, so the quicker we can catch it before it builds up, because when we keep it on the mind, it gets heavy. And so catch it quick. Throw old girlfriends out of the mind. Don't let them stay. That, in fact, that's one of the things that You guys are young, maybe except for a couple of us like Chris. But Chris, I think that you can understand that in my life and probably in yours, there have been memories of things that came up 25, 35, 45, 55 years ago, 65 years ago, things come up and those things are so dead. And so when I think about it, I think about it like a house that I used to live in. In fact, it was my grandmother's house. I'll tell you a little bit about it. The house was built in 1920. And that even as a monk in the United States, I still felt responsible for the new hot water heater and the plumbing and tearing up the floor in the bathroom and putting a new floor in and all of that kind of stuff. So that's just the context. Now, when I think about that house, Just any, any image, a flash, just anything I can say, wow, I'm glad I don't have to live there anymore. Wow, I'm so glad that I don't have to put up with that job, whatever it was. So anything that you have and that comes from the past, you can immediately think, wow, I'm really glad that that's over. Wow, isn't it nice? I don't have to put up with that. Even to the point that now that I can think of it, because my mom's been dead now for several years, whenever I think of her, I could say, wow, I don't have to think about my mom anymore at all. She's dead. What a relief it is. I don't have to think about her at all. What good would it do if I did think about her? Am I going to reminisce and then figure out something that I did wrong and I abused her in some way? Now how am I going to feel, right? And there's nothing I can do about it. So throw that old house, throw mom, dead moms, dead animals, anything that comes into the mind, throw it back out. We don't need it. We could be completely comfortable and happy right here, right now. But when we start dredging up the past, we're asking for trouble, and we're going to find it. We start— I mean, if it's, uh, that old house, we'll say, oh wow, I should go back to that old house. It belongs to somebody else now. I don't even know the owner. I never met him. But I should go tell him about his house.

**Speaker F:** To me, that reminiscing is connected to wanting all things to be new again.

**Speaker C:** Yes, exactly true. Reminiscing is dangerous because we want old things to be new again instead of letting the newness of this present moment be all the newness that I need.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So that's how we handle old girlfriends— just throw them out.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Dhammarato?

**Speaker C:** Yes?

**Speaker E:** Another way that— before you gave me this idea of like, you know, noticing the thought when it comes and then just throwing it out— maybe this is another version of that. What I've been doing is is I'll have like these feelings or desires come up of like wanting to be in her presence or talk to her or have sex with her or whatever. And then I'll just kind of like sit there and see all of it. And at first it looks like this scary kind of like thing, like almost like a monster that's coming in to attack me, like, oh my gosh, I don't want to feel this. But then the more I just see it, it's like I'm now hugging the monster. It's like we're now having a warm embrace. And so this whole experience is like horrifyingly beautiful. It's like the ephemeral nature of the entire thing. It's like this pain looks solid. It looked like something I needed to do about it. I needed to run away from it or chase it down. And then all of a sudden It's like as if it wasn't even there because I just surrendered to it. I just opened my arms to it.

**Speaker C:** So what you're saying is, is that you spent a few mind moments just running into a brick wall. Here's another way of handling it. As soon as the thought comes from her about her, you can throw her out. Now what you were saying is, is that when she comes, you have a good moment, then you have a really, really bad moment, and then you have a resolution to that bad moment and come back into having good feelings about her, right? So it goes with thought— no, good feelings, bad feelings, good feelings. Is that the sequence?

**Speaker E:** I don't, I don't think so. You got me questioning it, but that's not exactly what I meant. What I meant is that when you look at this thing called pain, whatever it is which is bringing pain, the thoughts, the feelings, whatever it is, right? And you sit with it for a minute and you see it.

**Speaker C:** That's what I'm recommending against. I'm recommending you not do that.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Okay. Because what you're saying that after you sit with it a few minutes, then you can resolve it.

**Speaker E:** Well, it resolves itself just by— No, you resolve it.

**Speaker C:** You make that change. Come on, guys, you're not that much of a victim of your own life. You took responsibility and you resolved it. You let it go. And what I'm saying, do that earlier. As soon as she comes to mind, you don't have to go into the conflict and then resolve the conflict.

**Speaker B:** Conflict.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** And in fact, you can see her in the mind, throw her out, and then have that as the resolution of the conflict. In other words, you can immediately feel good. Wow, I'm glad I don't have to think about her. I'm glad I don't have to have a trauma and then resolve it. I can just throw it out immediately.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I mean, I appreciate that, but it's interesting because I thought that was kind of like a victory, because usually these things, when they come up, they would seem sticky. They would seem like I need to do something about them. But now I can kind of just see them and surrender. It's like this act of surrendering, just making peace with it in the moment of seeing it. And it's kind of like the same thing happens. I throw it out, but it just doesn't look the same way as what you're saying.

**Speaker C:** So in the early days, or let us say before that you would have the thought of the girl, then you'll have a long, long time of conflict, conflict, and conflict, and finally a resolution. And now you've gotten it to where the thought of the girl comes and then a little bit of conflict, a little more conflict, and then resolution. And now you're saying, why don't I just do thought of the girl, have some conflict, and then resolve it? And my solution is to say, as soon as the girl thought comes, throw that out. Out, don't go through the conflict and the conflict resolution and come to an even finer, more relaxing resolution. Wow, I didn't even have to go through that cycle. I got even a better resolution by not going through the conflict, conflict resolution cycle.

**Speaker A:** Hmm. Okay.

**Speaker C:** But immediately I can feel good. Well, I don't have to think about that old house. Well, I don't have to think about that old job. 'Well, I don't have to think about that old car.' 'Well, I don't have to think about that old woman.' 'Well, I don't have to think about that young chick.' 'I don't have to think about that kind of stuff because it's not here now.' Okay, and then you can go around saying, 'Well, I don't have to think about anything because there's nothing going on.'.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** All right, so how quick are you going to catch it? You're already talking about, uh, how you're speeding it up and getting there so that you spend less and less time in conflict before you go to resolution. So I'm saying, yeah, we can short-circuit that even just as soon as the thought comes up of her. In fact, when the thought does come up, that's almost already a kind of a conflict because she's not here.

**Speaker E:** What you don't care about the thoughts so much?

**Speaker C:** You should start thinking about the thoughts that you've got, because there are many of them are unwholesome, leading you into feelings that you don't really need to have when you could have feelings of joy and delight and happiness directly without having to go through any conflict to get a conflict resolution to find your joy. You can have the joy directly. That's one of the delusions that you've been told. That's one of the lies that you've been told, is conflict resolution is wonderful, therefore let's go have some conflict. We don't need any conflict. We could just resolve it directly. Okay. As soon as she comes to mind, throw her out with thoughts like, wow, I'm glad I don't have to think about her. Well, isn't it nice that that's not a problem? It's not a conflict. Nothing to do, no place to go. Everything is all right.

**Speaker E:** The only issue I have with that is that, like, the only reason why I would throw out a thought is because my relationship to it is such that I don't want it around. But if my relationship to the thought is, oh, Oh, that's okay. That's another one. Oh, that's okay. Oh, that's fine too.

**Speaker C:** If you step into that cow pasture, be aware that there are going to be cow pies. That's the whole point is of going in and thinking about someone is that you're going to have a mixed bag. Your relationship with her was a mixed bag. If you start into the top of the bag that feels good, you don't have to go very deep before you run into a bunch of crap.

**Speaker E:** You're right.

**Speaker C:** Better to keep your hand out of that bag.

**Speaker E:** Okay, okay. So you're talking about specific example.

**Speaker C:** Christopher, you got your hand up.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I, I was just thinking, you know, this kind of— I feel like it ties a little into what Parker said because, you know, you're— and, and what Alex is talking about because.

**Speaker E:** I.

**Speaker D:** Have a tendency to, number one, think through things continuously, but it's been very effective for a lot of areas of my life. And in other areas, it's a disaster because I'm always in my head instead of being in the real world.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker D:** Is there an appropriate time to spend some time in your head? I mean, But again, it's difficult for me to completely shut that off, this whole trying to figure things out and thinking things through, because again, it has been really successful. Like Alex was talking about a situation going on with his girlfriend, there's been many times where I've thought through conversations with people and those conversations have turned out much better than if I had just gone into the conversation without thinking it through ahead of times. So, and, you know, same thing with Parker talking about, you know, researching things before he gets into them. Things have turned out way better when I've spent a little bit of time thinking it through and, you know, going through my head. The question is, is when do you turn that off, or when do you turn it on? And, you know, when is it useful, and when, you know, how do you turn it off when it's not useful? Because that's my difficulty, is turning it.

**Speaker C:** Off when it's no longer That's a really excellent question, and the answer to that has to do then with wisdom. When you see things the way that they're headed, in other words, having the thought of the girl is because we're not looking at the desire and other things like that. So there is also the idea of reflecting or figuring things out.

**Speaker A:** Out.

**Speaker C:** In other words, reviewing the evidence is not a bad idea. Looking at what's going on, and Samatha has a word for it, he calls it wise reflection, to reflect wisely over what has occurred, or coming to the solution to a problem And that.

**Speaker B:** One.

**Speaker C:** Of the hobbies, in fact the only hobby that I've got, has to do with servers and hard drives and things like this. And so I actually apply that kind of thing to that. But after I've done that kind of thing, oh, wouldn't it be good if I put SSDs on the data collection stream? Because that data collection stream has a lot of, you know, and so I've gone through that. But after I've had the idea of the improvement, the actual implementation of that improvement had to be done in the moment. That if I try to implement it the way that I thought about it, it will always be a failure. That our plans never work out. We can use wise reflection to get an idea of how things are going. But don't get attached to, I've got to do it the way that I thought about it. Rather, we have to stay open in that moment. A clear example is the guy who— he has an argument with his girlfriend. Then he goes into the meditation hall and sits having a meditation sitting. And while he's there, he rehashes that argument with his girlfriend. Thinking that he's now got just the right thing that he wants to tell her. He's got it solved. And so he enjoys the rest of the meditation or something like that. And then he comes out and he starts that conversation with his girlfriend, only to find out that she's got a new answer. And the answer that he dreamed up while he was sitting in meditation didn't work. It wasn't effective. You hear where I'm coming from? In other words, yes, it's good to reflect, but don't let our new reflection or our new decision that we have made cloud the next present moment, that we don't come attached to, oh, that's the solution to the problem, but rather we can take that as, oh, that's the direction that I'm going. That we don't ever know what the results are ever going to be. The best we can do is get things going in the right direction. So that's a better way of looking at it, is that we can't actually solve that into that problem intellectually because we don't have the reality of that present moment to deal with it. We're all— we have our own ideas, but we can get things going in the right direction. That that's wisdom. And that's the question that you're asking. Yes, we do want to do some reflection. We do want to figure out that I can change this and I can change that. But don't get attached to that, because when you implement it, you're going to have to implement it in an environment that you didn't actually consider all of. One of the jokes that I tell is about the guy who stops in at the 7-Eleven, and for him, it's a drop-dead gorgeous babe behind the counter. And when he leaves the store and drives down the highway, he's thinking about that girl. But all he can think about is his own imagination. All he can do is look at her face, and what he sees is the makeup and all of that. But there's 10,000 stories about her that he doesn't know. He doesn't know that she's got two ex-husbands that are jealous and trying to kill each other. She doesn't know that she's got two teenage kids that hate every guy that comes into her life and that they learned to do that from her mother, who really does hate every guy that comes into her life. And so now you've got a mother that's going to hate you. You've got two ex-boyfriends that are going to hate you and two kids that are going to hate you. And all you can think about is the girl that you want to love. That's the problem that we have, is that when we are doing our reflections, we don't take in all the data that we need. But we can get enough data to know which direction to go in. This is wisdom, is looking at where the way that things are pointed or way that things are aimed. I use the word about a gun, because I have been around them enough. I haven't been on very many rifle ranges, but I did go hunting when I was a teenager. And the scene was that there was an old man that was carrying a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun under his left arm, just letting it hang there while he was walking around, pointing it at various trees and various kneecaps and things like that. And everybody in that hunting party got really pissed off at this guy.

**Speaker B:** Why?

**Speaker C:** Because he wasn't mindful of the way that his shotgun was pointing. I hear that that's a very important thing on gun ranges now, that everybody is quite mindful of which direction the guns are pointing, because if you've got a gun that's waving around in the air, it might go off. That's dangerous. If we can recognize that our mouth is like a gun, we got to make sure which direction that is always pointing, because it could go off at any moment. And to which direction is the mouth pointing? It's in the mind, wherever the mind is pointing. So watch how your mind is pointing, and you do that through this reflection. But just because we know which direction to go doesn't mean that we know what the results are. Just because the gun is going— is pointed in that particular direction doesn't mean that we know exactly what target it's going to hit, because we don't know that. But we do have a general idea that if the gun is pointed in that direction, it's not going to hit a target over there. That we can tell. And so this is what we mean by wisdom, is figuring out which direction things are headed. You can see that in a conversation with someone, that if you say something, you can see how they react to it. And if we react in a certain way, you can say, oh, well, I'm not going to take this conversation in that direction. Let's take it someplace else. And so that's one of the reasons why I like to have people on the video, is I can see the nodding heads and the smiles and the other confusions and things like this. And so when people have a confused look on their face, I'll know to go back and recircle around found it. But if they've got smiling like that, then I know that they've got it and we can move on. So this is an example of that, is look at the way that people's faces, expressions, nodding, and other things like that in the moment, or in the sense of reflecting, that you can figure out which direction you want to take things. But going back to that idea about, oh, I'm going to put SSDs on my data collection devices, I had no idea that I would wind up with the configuration that I have right now, because that was all experimental. It had the idea of I'm going to add SSDs, but the actual implementation of it was something that had to be experimented with and played with and things like that in the present moment. But if I had demanded that, oh, I'm going to implement those SSDs exactly the way that I thought about them in the first place, I still wouldn't have a system going. So there's a combination of the two, and that is that yes, we can use wise reflection to figure out things, but we can't get attached to our figuring out. We have to still implement it in the present moment. Does that help? Help, Chris?

**Speaker D:** Yes, very much.

**Speaker C:** Okay, thank you. Well, does anybody else have anything? Robert, I'm glad to see you come on. I see that you called me yesterday late and I didn't get it. I apologize for that. I hope to see you again soon. We also have a guest. Guest 31 detected. Well, does anybody have any more to say? I mean, we've been going now about an hour and 40 minutes. This has been very interesting. Anybody got any extra questions or anything? Well, guys, it's been really good to see you again. Hope to see you all again soon.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker F:** Have a nice weekend, you.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you for the first time, Chris.

**Speaker D:** Yep, see you guys later.

**Speaker A:** Bye.

**Speaker C:** See you, Robert. See you, guest.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker C) with a group of Sangha friends, revolves around the theme of **restlessness, doubt, and the unwise pursuit of information**, contrasting it with a mind of wise awareness and contentment. Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Theme**
The discussion explores how the mind often feels a restless need to acquire information or resolve uncertainty, and how this can lead to suffering. The alternative is cultivating "wise ignorance"—a calm, present-moment awareness where not knowing is acceptable.

### **Key Points and Teachings**

1. **The Nature of Restlessness & Doubt**
   - Restlessness often manifests as a feeling that "I won't be safe unless I know." This can apply to academic topics, daily situations, or past events (like a lightning bolt that has already struck).
   - The group uses analogies:
     - A Ukrainian soldier doesn't turn at an explosion behind him because he knows it missed him; the event is over.
     - A teenager afraid of a bully *before* any interaction creates his own suffering.
   - The point: We often react to "near misses" or uncertainties as if they are direct threats, causing unnecessary agitation.

2. **Three Kinds of Ignorance**
   Dhammarato outlines a crucial framework:
   - **Wise Ignorance**: "I don't know, I know I don't know, and I'm comfortably happy not knowing." Information is welcomed when it arises, but its absence isn't a problem.
   - **Delusional Ignorance**: "I think I know." Forming opinions with inadequate information and clinging to them despite evidence. This is common and leads to conflict (e.g., preemptive strikes in warfare, political polarization).
   - **Doubt (Hindrance)**: "I don't know, and I *need* to know." This restless need to resolve uncertainty is a form of suffering.

3. **Cultural Contrast: West vs. East**
   - **Western mindset**: Tends to overvalue information, often equating it with ownership and control (e.g., copyrights, patents). This creates pressure to always "know."
   - **Asian mindset** (as exemplified in Thailand): Often sees information as shared; ownership relates more to the physical medium. This can lead to greater ease with not knowing.
   - The implication: The Western Buddhist tendency to think meditation is about "going deep inside" can miss the simple practice of being awake to the present moment ("be here now").

4. **Application in Daily Life & Meditation**
   - **Mindfulness in Action**: The talk emphasizes awareness of the present over "going deep." Examples include:
     - The Zen stick (to wake up the inattentive).
     - Martial arts (where inattention gets you hit).
     - The practice of noticing thoughts of past/future and gently letting them go.
   - **Handling Desire & Relationships**: A significant part of the discussion uses a participant's recent breakup as a case study.
     - **The Method**: When a thought of the ex-partner arises, immediately recognize "she is not here now" and release the thought. Don't entertain fantasies, rehearse conversations, or check the phone compulsively.
     - **The Key**: Short-circuit the cycle of craving → conflict → resolution by dropping the thought at the moment of arising. This is more efficient than "sitting with" the pain until it dissolves.
     - **Wisdom vs. Emotion**: Distinguish between wise feeling (recognizing liking/disliking at the point of contact) and emotional reaction (which is based on need and delusion).

5. **Wise Reflection vs. Unwise Rumination**
   - It's skillful to reflect and plan (**wise reflection**), but unskillful to become attached to those plans or to ruminate on past/future scenarios (**unwise thinking**).
   - Example: Thinking through a technical problem is useful, but when implementing the solution, stay open to the actual conditions of the present moment. Don't let your preconceived idea blind you to reality.

6. **The Root of "Good and Evil"**
   - Concepts of good and evil typically arise from unexamined **liking and disliking**, which themselves are often based on biological instinct or cultural conditioning (not wisdom).
   - True Dhamma practice involves seeing preferences clearly at the point of contact and asking, "Why do I like this? Is this instinct? Is this learned?" This undermines the automatic judgment of things as inherently good or bad.

### **Practical Takeaways**
- **Cultivate "Wise Ignorance"**: Be at peace with not knowing. Not all information is necessary for happiness.
- **Catch Thoughts Early**: When unwholesome or restless thoughts arise (about the past, future, or an absence), let them go immediately with a phrase like "not here now."
- **Be Here Now**: The core practice is awareness of the present—like the breath, bodily sensations, or immediate environment—not escaping into "deep" internal states.
- **Examine Liking/Disliking**: Investigate the root of your attractions and aversions. See them as conditioned, not absolute truths.
- **Reflect Wisely, But Don't Cling**: Use thinking for direction, not for creating fixed blueprints. Implement wisdom in the flexible present moment.

The talk is a practical guide to replacing doubt and restlessness with serene awareness, using everyday examples and participant interactions to illustrate profound Dhamma principles.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here is a breakdown of the primary metaphors and stories used in the talk to illustrate points about mindfulness, awareness, and mental habits:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Lightning Bolt / Near Miss (from Buddhadasa & Ukrainian Soldier):**
    *   **Story:** A person so satisfied (enlightened) wouldn't turn to look at a lightning strike behind them. This is compared to a Ukrainian soldier who doesn't flinch when a shell explodes nearby because he knows it missed him.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate non-reactivity and wise attention. We often expend mental energy on "near misses" or past events that pose no actual threat, creating unnecessary restlessness and fear.

2.  **The School Bully:**
    *   **Story:** A teenage boy sees bullies coming and freezes in fear before they even notice him, thereby attracting their attention. If he were aware and unattached to the fear, he could take smart evasive action.
    *   **Purpose:** To show how our preemptive fear and mental projections ("near misses" we treat as hits) create the very problems we fear. It contrasts delusional reaction with wise, present-moment responsiveness.

3.  **The Zen Stick (Kyōsaku):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The practice in Zen where a master strikes a dozing student with a stick to encourage alertness.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the importance of being awake and aware in the present moment to "avoid getting hit" by life's difficulties. It criticizes a view of meditation as only "going deep inside" instead of cultivating situational awareness.

4.  **The Puppy Biting Feet:**
    *   **Story:** Speaker C's puppy relentlessly bites his feet, even when kicked away. It's a "super alpha" driven by instinct.
    *   **Purpose:** Used first as a literal interruption, then reframed as a metaphor for persistent, "unwholesome" thoughts (like desire or restlessness) that keep coming back despite our efforts to dismiss them. Illustrates the tenacity of certain mental habits.

5.  **Ownership of Information (CDs & Software in West vs. Asia):**
    *   **Story/Example:** Contrasts Western copyright law (owning the *information* on a CD) with a common Asian perspective (owning the *physical* CD). Uses the prevalence of unauthorized Windows copies in Thailand as an example.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that the Western over-valuation of and attachment to "information" or "knowing" leads to control, delusion, and dissatisfaction. It suggests the Asian (and by extension, the wise) approach is less clingy to concepts and data.

6.  **The Maze ("Amazing"):**
    *   **Etymology:** Breaks down the word "amaze" to its root meaning of being trapped in a maze.
    *   **Purpose:** To reframe wonder or confusion. It can be a pleasurable state of not-knowing, or a dangerous one if there's a "tiger in the maze" (real danger). Connects to the talk's theme about the "need to know."

7.  **Watching Movies / Cliffhangers:**
    *   **Story:** Speaker C explains he skims movies, watching only the start and end, because the formula is predictable. References cliffhangers from *The Perils of Pauline* to *Star Wars*.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how our "need to know" is manipulated by narrative and is often based on learned habits rather than necessity. It shows we are conditioned to seek closure and resolution, creating mental restlessness.

8.  **The Grocery Aisle & Cereal Box:**
    *   **Story:** A child sees a cereal box (e.g., Post Toasties), decides "I am not good without it," and throws a tantrum. A wise mother might let the child hold the box in the store but leave it at checkout.
    *   **Purpose:** A foundational metaphor for the genesis of desire, clinging, and the delusion of "I need X to be complete." It traces the chain from seeing to liking to wanting to needing.

9.  **Beauty Standards (Bollywood vs. Hollywood):**
    *   **Example:** Contrasts fat heroes/heroines in Bollywood with slender ones in Hollywood, and Western 12-tone music with Indian scales.
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate that much of what we "like" or find "good" is culturally conditioned, not innate or wise. It challenges the instinctive belief that our attractions are purely biological or true.

10. **Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (The Platters song):**
    *   **Metaphor:** Desire is like a fire that produces smoke, clouding our vision and judgment.
    *   **Purpose:** Used directly to advise Alex: extinguish the fire of desire for his ex-girlfriend, and the "smoke" will clear, allowing him to see wisely and act appropriately if she contacts him.

11. **The Gun & The Mouth:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a gun, and speech is its ammunition. An unmindful person lets their "gun" (mind/mouth) wave around dangerously.
    *   **Story:** Supports this with an anecdote about an careless hunter pointing his shotgun at people's knees.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the critical importance of mindfulness and wise reflection *before* speaking or acting. We must be aware of where our mind is "pointing" because it will soon "fire."

### **Key Framing Concepts (Almost Metaphorical)**

*   **Three Kinds of Ignorance:** Framed as a taxonomy to understand our relationship to not-knowing.
    1.  **Wise Ignorance:** "I don't know, I know I don't know, and I'm fine with that." (Bliss)
    2.  **Delusional Ignorance:** "I think I know" (clinging to opinion over facts). (Dangerous)
    3.  **Doubtful Ignorance:** "I don't know, and I **need** to know." (A hindrance, guaranteed suffering)
*   **The Cow Pasture / Bag of Mixed Feelings:** Thinking about a past relationship is like stepping into a cow pasture (you'll step in crap) or reaching into a bag that has good stuff on top but crap underneath. Advises to keep your "hand out of the bag."

**Overall Theme:** The talk uses these vivid metaphors and stories to argue against a Western, information-obsessed, and desire-driven mode of consciousness. It promotes a mindset of "wise ignorance," present-moment awareness, and the ability to let go of thoughts and desires quickly before they create suffering.
