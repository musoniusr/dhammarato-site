### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello, Pedro. I don't think it started yet.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it started. I don't see you, but it started.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll turn the camera back on. It happens sometimes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So the camera is good. All right, so, um, what— there's several things to mention. Um, actually, can you turn your, uh, uh, mic off? Kind of noisy. All right, so, um, the, the first thing let's talk about was what you were— you wrote down about satisfaction and wanting more of it. Okay, this is absolutely quite typical. Everybody goes through this. There is actually a frame of reference for it that has a particular verbiage to it. It's called spiritual materialism, for one thing, and another one is desiring desirelessness, or wanting more satisfaction. It all comes in the same ground, is that now that you're practicing satisfaction, the hindrances will keep coming back up saying more, what's next. What happens now? Etc., like that. And we have to keep bringing it back to, right now is good enough. This is satisfying. And then the mind will want, well, what's next? The mind will want, well, I'm satisfied, but I bet I can have more satisfaction. Okay? That in fact, it's a kind of a material or spiritual greed. Spiritual materialism, wanting more and wanting more, to where in fact what you see is what you get. What there is is what we have. And that we have to practice this because we have been practicing wanting more and more and more our whole lives. We were taught to want more. We were taught to get to first base and then work hard to get to second base. And when you're thinking about second base, You're actually thinking about third base and the home run. You got to go all around. You can't get a point until you finish, right? This is the whole mentality that we're built with. And so practicing catching that mentality is a lot of fun. Start to look, start to figure out when that kind of thing is happening. When the mind is practicing satisfaction and wanting more satisfaction— Aha, I caught you! This is actually good enough. We don't have to get something next. There is no next. This is it. Let's stay and enjoy it. This is— it takes practice to do this over and over and over again because the mind isn't normally wanting more and more. Now, the next point that I would like to mention to you, which is actually directly related to this in a strange way, and that is that when we get practiced, when we get success, we can recognize that success as success. But in our culture, especially with Christianity, we're taught not. We're taught instead to be humble, right? You use that word, in fact. And the humility is actually coming from that you should not be prideful, you should be humble. Because you don't deserve to be prideful, you deserve to be humble, you're not good enough. And so that thinking then that you're not good enough, and so therefore you should hide what you do have, that we cannot, let us say, be prideful. That in fact in our society prideful Anagami and humility are opposites. Within the context of the Buddha, they're very, very similar. They're the outcome of competition. And what we're planning on and what we're practicing and what we're doing is coming out of the comparisons, coming out of the competition. That if we compare ourselves to someone, then we'll either come up short or long, will either come up prideful or the loser. And so, in our society, we actually congratulate the loser, we congratulate the humility. We don't like someone to go around acting prideful, because it hurts our feelings. They're supposed to be humble. 'Like me,' right? And so we go with that mentality, and that the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is actually quite opposite of that, in the sense that we go for gaining that satisfaction, we gain the success, we put the work into it, we continue to put the work into it, and we get the results, we get the value out of it. Michael is calling. Is it okay that I add him to the call?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, oh yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll go ahead and add You should be answering. The ringing in my ear is very noisy. Okay, so that didn't work. I thought that I would add him to the call, but it didn't work. So we'll continue on with what we're talking about, and that is when we compete with each other We see each other as kind of an adversary or an enemy. We don't see each other as friends. And when we see each other as adversaries or enemies, then we want to compete, we want to show dominance, we want to find out who's in charge here, we want to find out who's the alpha male in the crowd, etc. like that. This is quite normal human behavior. And so we compete with each other to find out who's one up and who's one down. And in any particular group, there's only supposed to be one guy that's up, and everybody else has got to be humble. They've got to be one down, otherwise we're going to have a fight, right, to determine which one is on top. So in the context of the Buddha, since we are all friends anyway, that we can all also be winners. We can all be champions together without having to compete with one another. So we give each other credit for being on top of the world, that it's okay to be on top of the world, that you don't have to be humble. About it. The sutras are full of this kind of stuff in this, in the way of that whatever assembly the Buddha goes to, he's basically the center of attention. He can walk into any assembly and meet with the people, converse with them on whatever topics that they want to converse, and not feel afraid not feel dejected, not feel like an outsider. You feel like you own the place. Now, that feeling is part of the development, you see, that when you have satisfaction, but a little satisfaction and not enough satisfaction, that's back into that humble pride competition, comparing ourselves, etc. And so we can in fact come out of that by congratulating ourselves for doing what we can do, become successful. This satisfaction is satisfactory, it's good enough, I can handle it. So we begin to catch that I want more. I'm humble, I don't have enough, I'm not good enough, I want more, I want more satisfaction. I've got satisfaction, but I want more of it. Now we're going to change that by saying, aha, I can see that wanting, I can see that desire, I can see that desiring desirelessness quality to it that I want more. And so we can then just say, aha, I caught you. And let it go and come back to, "This is good enough, this is fine, I got what I need, this is enough." So we go for that quality of, "This is enough." And when we have that quality, we take on that winner's attitude. We've got the win, we've got it. And so there's no reason now to be humble. Take your prize. If you've won the Olympics, go get your gold medal, stand on that stage. Be one of the Lions. This is the way that we practice, is to take on that Lion's Roar, to take that on, to take that satisfaction. And success. And we practice that every moment. This is it. In this present moment, we're good enough. And so this is a new change of attitude. What do you think, Pedro?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just really, I'm— it's since yesterday that I'm wondering if my— some of the tendencies that I have also for the— like the fact that I say often like, okay, no, well, I will stop using the mind, I will I will also go with feelings. I will not make thoughts, you know, just stay without thoughts, without thinking. You know, some tendency that I believe I'm good, but I really also looking into the Dharma if these things is recognized or it's wrong or something, you know. It never arise the doubt in me before, like I was thinking, okay, just Yeah, I was like already thinking about this thing and, you know, I'm happy. But sometimes I think maybe, you know, not everything is like already like should be in the Dharma path. Like also this thing too, I don't really, I prefer not to use the mind. Like I let the things that are going on go on, but I don't feed any thought, I don't feed any any plan, any thought, just because when I don't use thought, you know, I'm kind of naturally satisfied. But I see that also it's like, it's natural satisfaction, and it's also like, I see like kind of dropping away of things. So sometimes I identify with this process, you know, identify with the process of, okay, like habits are falling away and, uh, and, uh, yeah, like, uh, vibration is higher, habits are falling away, stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, knowing that we have, when we take identification with something, we identify with it, we become that. And in that regard, what that means is that we're not fixed. We can change. We can change our ID. And by identifying with the Buddha, by identifying with the Dharma, by identifying with the Sangha, That's what we become. And so taking that identity, putting our attention on it, that's what we're going to be spending our mental moments thinking about. We become ego.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I really realizing also how, in fact, yeah, I was on a sort of, yeah, on sort of my stream in some way. But really now I'm really preferring actually the Sangha to my personal stream of thinking and my personal stream of tendency. Also, if I believe it's completely spiritual, but I really find it more pure, the stream of the Dharma, more interesting. And for this reason also, at first it was like, okay, I want to hang out because I find myself really really good in the company of the Sangha people, but now it's like, no, it's really more also a more need because I realized that if I'm too much away, then I go back into my own stream of spirituality or something that I realize is not really what I want. So I find myself coming back, but also with more consciousness, knowing that It's not only because I enjoy, but also because it's good, because it's like I learn to disidentify from my own patterns and find new pathways. Because otherwise, when I left alone, I suddenly go in the certainties that I have, but I find that then don't really come from a true place.

**Speaker A:** So all you have to do now is develop the Sati to remember, to wake up to that, to wake up to the old and say, "Hey, I've got better things to do with this moment than remembering who I used to be." You do it the old way. So that's the whole process, is beginning to wake up to recognize, to remember that we've got a choice. Every minute we've got a choice. If we can wake up, we've got a choice. If we don't wake up, we don't have a choice. We just go the way that we've been doing it in the past. But every time that we wake up, We've got a choice. That gives you power, the power of choice, the power to be the king of your own hill, to be the emperor of your own pile of dirt, to be the master of your own life, one choice at a time. Anicca, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's wonderful because, yeah, one thinks that, okay, no, because, yeah, I changed again attitude for another time again, really, because in fact The first thing that I thought was, okay, I will stay in the Dharma, in the Sangha, until it reflects me. But then I realized that it was not coming from a true place, that I just wanted to go on doing things. But then staying in the Sangha, I realized that actually the direction that The Sangha could take me is a way better more than the direction I was going alone.

**Speaker A:** Well, when we deal with ordinary people and we have our Dukkha, they will help us stay in the Dukkha. When we're in a noble Sangha, when we're around others, we will find someone there that will help us to come out of our Dukkha, not stay in it. The example would be an argument. When one guy is arguing, he actually needs a partner to argue with him, and then both of them feel bad. But when they can be friends instead of argument partners, then they can feel good. But it takes one of them to remember to do that, to make a change. So that's up— actually, it's up to you. Can you remember to make a change?

**Speaker B:** Yes, because I have like this preconcept in my mind that I go to a place Only if that helps me standing better on my feet alone. And so like I take suggestion for the things and then I go away and I say, okay, no more useful. I got what I need to get and so on. But yeah, really, I don't know because It's true also, but it's also true that I realize that I would like to stay also.

**Speaker A:** Well, whenever we fall out, never mind, start again, come back.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We're not ever going to get what we want. But we can be satisfied when we don't get what we want. Yeah, in fact, the only time that we'll ever get what we want is when we're really, really wise about what we want, so that we only want the things that are really easy to get. Okay, that's the only way to get what we want, is by being very, very wise about what we want, so that what we want we can easily get. Yeah. Was today what we said, was that good for you? Was this helpful?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, totally. And yeah, totally, because yeah, it's like a new change of attitude. Like, I recognize that I don't know what to say, but it's like I prefer to stay in the Sangha than stay out in the Sangha but on my two legs. Like, I don't know how to say it. If it's wrong, tell me, but.

**Speaker A:** I.

**Speaker B:** Think I'm starting to realize that it's better for me to work in the Sangha and maybe find other people and support each other than like say, okay, I don't need support at all because for the support sake, like I don't need the support at all. And then finding myself away in my old patterns and building pile of shit every time, even if I'm alone.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact, having friends in the Sangha is extremely helpful. Being on our own sometimes is quite slow. An example of that would be that you've got to move from one apartment to the other. If you move everything on your own, it's really, really tough work. But if you got some friends, then you can make easy work of it, especially like moving furniture that's too big for one person to handle. It takes two people. It's too big for one. Yeah, okay. Some of the, some of the mental crap takes two people. It's too big for one person to do it, but he's going to have to be the one who does to take the charge of it. We can get some help from our friends. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you for this perspective, Dhammarato. I found it really useful. I appreciate it very much, your teachings.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, Pedro, we'll talk to you later. Keep going, man. You're getting it. You're on your way.

**Speaker B:** See you, Dhammarato. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

**Core Theme:** Overcoming spiritual materialism and cultivating genuine satisfaction.

**Main Teachings from Dhammarato (Speaker A):**

1.  **"Spiritual Materialism" or "Desiring Desirelessness":** A common trap in practice is the mind treating satisfaction like a commodity—feeling some peace but then asking, "What's next?" or "How can I get *more* satisfaction?" This is a form of greed, where the mind's lifelong habit of wanting more infiltrates the spiritual path.

2.  **The Antidote: "This is enough":** The practice is to repeatedly catch the mind wanting "more" and gently return to the recognition that **the present moment, as it is, is already good enough and satisfying.** This requires retraining a mind conditioned by a culture of constant striving and comparison.

3.  **Re-framing Pride & Humility:** Western/Christian conditioning often equates humility with "not being good enough," leading to a mindset of lack. The Buddha's path encourages taking **joyful ownership of your success and satisfaction.** It's about developing a "winner's attitude" or "Lion's Roar"—acknowledging your progress without competition or arrogance, simply because you've done the work and seen the result.

4.  **Sangha as Essential Support:** Trying to do everything alone is slow and difficult. A noble Sangha (spiritual community) provides crucial friendship and support to help you move away from old, unskillful patterns ("mental crap") that are sometimes "too big for one person to handle." The Sangha helps you dis-identify from personal, limited streams of thinking.

**Key Insights from Pedro (Speaker B):**

*   He recognizes his own tendency to seek a natural, thought-free satisfaction on his own, but now sees that this personal "spiritual stream" can become a limiting pattern of certainties.
*   He realizes the Dharma and Sangha offer a "purer," more reliable path than his isolated tendencies. His motivation shifts from using the Sangha only until he feels independent, to a genuine need to stay connected to avoid falling back into old, insular habits.
*   He moves from an attitude of solitary independence ("standing on my own two feet") to valuing collaborative work and mutual support within the Sangha.

**Practical Takeaways:**

*   **Mindfulness Check:** Use mindfulness (*sati*) to catch the mind when it desires "more satisfaction" and reaffirm "this is enough."
*   **Power of Choice:** Every moment of awareness presents a choice—to follow old patterns or to choose a new, more skillful path based on the Dhamma.
*   **Embrace Support:** Actively engage with the Sangha. It is a practical aid for growth, not a sign of dependency. As Dhammarato puts it: "Whenever we fall out, never mind, start again, come back."

**Conclusion:** The talk guides the practitioner from a mindset of scarcity and spiritual consumerism to one of abundant satisfaction in the present, empowered by self-recognition and supported by spiritual friendship. The path is about making the wise choice, moment by moment, to identify with the Dhamma and the supportive community practicing it.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary metaphors and stories used by Speaker A (the teacher, Dhammarato) are:

**1. The Baseball Diamond Metaphor**
*   **Story:** "We were taught to get to first base and then work hard to get to second base. And when you're thinking about second base, you're actually thinking about third base and the home run... You can't get a point until you finish."
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the ingrained cultural mentality of constant striving, goal-orientation, and the belief that satisfaction is always at the next stage, never in the present moment.

**2. The Competition/Alpha Male Metaphor**
*   **Story:** Describing how people often see each other as adversaries, wanting to "show dominance, find out who's in charge... who's the alpha male in the crowd." This creates a dynamic where there's only "one guy that's up, and everybody else has got to be humble... otherwise we're going to have a fight."
*   **Purpose:** To contrast worldly social dynamics with the Buddhist ideal of a supportive Sangha (community). It frames humility in a competitive society as a form of enforced "losing" to avoid conflict.

**3. The Olympic Champion / Lion's Roar Metaphor**
*   **Story:** "If you've won the Olympics, go get your gold medal, stand on that stage. Be one of the Lions. This is the way that we practice, is to take on that Lion's Roar."
*   **Purpose:** To encourage owning one's spiritual success and satisfaction without false humility. It reframes legitimate pride (as an outcome of practice) not as arrogance, but as the rightful claim of a "champion" who has done the work. The "Lion's Roar" is a classic Buddhist metaphor for the fearless, confident proclamation of truth.

**4. The Buddha Entering an Assembly Metaphor**
*   **Story:** "Whatever assembly the Buddha goes to, he's basically the center of attention... and not feel afraid, not feel dejected, not feel like an outsider. You feel like you own the place."
*   **Purpose:** To provide an ideal model of confidence, ease, and natural authority that comes from genuine satisfaction and lack of insecurity, not from domination.

**5. The Moving Furniture Metaphor**
*   **Story:** "You've got to move from one apartment to the other. If you move everything on your own, it's really, really tough work. But if you got some friends, then you can make easy work of it... Some of the mental crap takes two people."
*   **Purpose:** To justify the necessity of the Sangha. Some internal struggles ("mental crap") are too heavy to handle alone; friends in the practice provide essential help and support, making the difficult work manageable.

**6. The "King of Your Own Hill" / "Emperor of Your Own Pile of Dirt" Metaphor**
*   **Story:** "That gives you power, the power of choice, the power to be the king of your own hill, to be the emperor of your own pile of dirt, to be the master of your own life, one choice at a time."
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize the empowerment that comes from mindfulness (*sati*). Each moment of waking up to choice is an exercise of sovereignty over one's own mind and life.

**7. The Argument Partners vs. Friends Story**
*   **Story:** "When one guy is arguing, he actually needs a partner to argue with him, and then both of them feel bad. But when they can be friends instead of argument partners, then they can feel good."
*   **Purpose:** To simply illustrate how unskillful patterns (like argument) require collusion and perpetuate suffering (*dukkha*), while a noble friend can help break the cycle by changing the dynamic.

**Core Conceptual Metaphors:**
*   **Spiritual Materialism / Spiritual Greed:** Framing the desire for "more satisfaction" as a form of acquisitiveness, similar to material greed, but applied to spiritual states.
*   **The Stream:** Speaker B talks about his "personal stream of thinking" versus the "stream of the Dharma." This metaphor contrasts the habitual flow of personal patterns with the purer, more reliable current of the teaching.
*   **Identification as Changeable Clothing:** The idea that we "identify with" things and "become that," but that we can change our identification like changing clothes (e.g., identifying with the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).

These metaphors and stories work together to dismantle the student's (Pedro's) hesitations about satisfaction, pride, and independence, and to build a new framework for practice based on present-moment contentment, supportive community, and empowered choice.
