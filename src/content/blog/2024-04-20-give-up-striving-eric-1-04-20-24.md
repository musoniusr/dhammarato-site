### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Of an agenda. I just, you know, I've been— oh, actually, I've been waiting months and months to speak with you, uh, after he put the idea out.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** Uh, so I did kind of come as hopefully as an empty container.

**Speaker C:** When I was in India, um, I was, uh, I learned about the twin methods of the hard and the soft, and that Westerners tend to go for the hard way—working, striving, translating, studying Pali, meditating in a hard way, going on trips to Dong, austerities. There's just so much of that. And that then there is the soft way. You could say also that the hard way is to gain the skills well enough and develop the ego well enough so that you can drop it. And the soft way is just letting things go in a kind of a soft way. But over time, I've become quite curious and actually can see that if someone who is on the hard path is going to make real progress, he will have to someday do it all so hard that he gives up, either in success or failure. That in fact, this is what happened to the Buddha, that he was a really tough dude. He was into those high Jhanas and sitting long times, and then he was into the austerities to the point that he nearly he killed himself. You've seen statues of the Starving Buddha, I'm sure, or the Fasting Buddha. And then, he recognized that that was not the way to go. And so he developed the Middle Path. And the Middle Path is a place between the extreme of working very hard, and the other extreme of living a life of sensuality and getting nothing done, but working at it in the wrong way. And then the middle path is basically just sit down and do nothing, and that's the soft way. And everyone who is going to actually learn to practice correctly has to take that final soft way, to give up striving, give up wanting something. For instance, many of the Westerners, both Hindu and Buddhist, use the word enlightenment and want to strive for it. It's a goal to get. And enlightenment basically has the two twin qualities of turning the lights on, having the light of day, seeing things clearly, and then dropping it all. Everything that you see, you set down. So if you see that you're striving, set the striving down. Become empty. And what that means is, is that after you set all that stuff down, you actually become light. You become lightweight, cheerful. Everything is okay. We don't need superlatives anymore. We can give up, uh, and even we can give up our grandiosity. Like wonderful, marvelous, into everything's just okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no problems. Yeah, and this is the actual real Eightfold Noble Path that the Buddha teaches, is the Eightfold Noble Path to gladden the mind, brighten the mind into the state of everything's okay. Not to worry about the past and try to fix it, and not worry about the future because you don't have it yet, and just be here now with nothing to do, no place to go, and everything is easy. And yet even when people hear that, they still strive.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly what John Mann was pointing out. And I really appreciated that he was courageous enough because everyone else in that ashram was just lockstep following what they were told and engaging.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker A:** It was very hard for me because I wasn't the work harder kind of guy like Rudy was, just like on fire. So yeah, I love it. I love it. It's hard for me to be in the middle, stay in the middle. Yeah, I struggle with that.

**Speaker C:** Have you ever heard of the concept practice like your hair is on fire?

**Speaker A:** I think I've heard of that, but I don't recall.

**Speaker C:** Okay, well, that can be seen in two ways. You see, the difference between the hard and the soft method is that the hard method strives. They'll call the fire department. Yes, they'll wrap big turbans on their head or anything like that to put the fire out. And the easy way out is basically, instead of using the word strive, we can turn it around to being persistent. Persistently, it's okay. Yeah, the hair is on fire, that's okay. It's okay. Time's a wasting. Yeah, good times for wasting. There's nothing to do and no place to go. And pretty soon all of that fire burns out, as you can tell.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, um, I, I think, uh, this past few years I've finally sorted things out, and, uh, I think, uh, you know, I've been experiencing, uh, you know, a calmness and bodhichitta spontaneously. Why?

**Speaker C:** Sorry, pardon?

**Speaker A:** Oh, what did you say? Why? Or no, what did you say?

**Speaker C:** No, I just said okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Okay.

**Speaker C:** So what can I do for you?

**Speaker A:** Well, you know, I want to come to Asia. I want to visit Thailand. But, uh, you know, I— before I die, I've never been to India. You know, here I've been studying Hinduism for 40-plus years, and, uh, oh, the.

**Speaker C:** Only way to study Hinduism is by being knee-deep in the cow shit of India.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, uh, and I've never been there. So, uh, I, uh— although technically, you know, I'm much feeling much closer to the, uh, the Tibetan Buddhist teaching, but the fact is, you know, gosh, here you are on a very different path, and you're delightful. I'd like to come. So I want to kind of— but I'm afraid to travel alone, and I'm afraid how dangerous it is. So I'm not— why don't you then.

**Speaker C:** Work on becoming fearless? Work in the sense of just giving up your fears.

**Speaker A:** Oh, because my wife is not capable of being fearless. And the fact is that But her.

**Speaker C:** Fear is not your fear, and if you become completely fearless, that'll give her a good example of what to do.

**Speaker A:** I don't feel quite responsible to be on my own, so I think it's safer to travel with others. So actually, ironically.

**Speaker C:** Well, there's a big difference between a traveler and a tourist. Big difference between a traveler and a tourist. A tourist is one— well, the tourist is the one who takes tours.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And they've got an agenda, they've got a schedule, they've got a group of people, they may have rented a bus, etc., like that. And they go in groups. And then a traveler is on his own. He's got no agenda, and the only place that he has to go is where he's headed. And that, um, a real, um, you— we can use word path and journey and pilgrimage in an ordinary kind of way, in the sense that everybody's on their own journey, everyone's on their own path, and that your responsibility to others is to get your own act together and then to spread that joy to others. That's the difference between the Mahayana and the Theravada, or the Hinayana and the Mahayana, in the sense of a big boat. That a big passenger ship, like for tourists, they have to stand in line and get a ticket and get on board, and then they have to just go wherever that ship is going to go. They don't have much choice about it. But a little boat, a paddle boat, a canoe, you can go where you want to go, do what you want to do, figure out what needs to be done and do it. And so, um, in a way then, if everyone is kind of headed in the next direct— in the right direction, then it's much more likely to be a flotilla of canoes rather than a giant vessel of tourists.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so tourists really don't get anywhere. The masses don't get anywhere. Going with that kind of flow is not the way to go. The real way to go with the flow is by going it alone. Everybody has to figure out their own mind. No one can help you figure out your own mind. Only you can do that. An example of that would be when people ask me to read a book, what books to read, I say read the book between your ears. That's the book that needs to be read. We have to figure out what it is that keeps us going. And when we figure out what it is that keeps us going, we recognize basically it's fear. Fear drives us, and the feelings are dissatisfying because we don't like to be afraid, we don't like to be driven. And when we figure out that the right thing to do is to start doing nothing, take a chance recognizing that things are really not dangerous. We were taught that things were dangerous when we were children, with Daddy with a stick. And we see a whole lot of Daddies out there with big sticks, and so we go around being afraid. And when we give up that fear, then we can sit down and do nothing because we're no longer driven. This is actually the real teaching of the Buddha. He said that the only thing that I teach, both formerly and now, is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means to see your own dissatisfactions, to see your own fears, see your own not liking and liking, and just stop, set it down, put down the burden. So back to that two forms of enlightenment: see the problem and then set it down. Not fix it, just put it away. And so everybody starts off on the hard path, and if they're lucky, they see that their path is hard, that they're struggling, that they're actually causing themselves more dissatisfaction, more fears, more suffering, and then they can just stop. To move out of that hard path into the soft path. And that has to be done in one's own canoe. And in fact, you could say that the way that we work with that canoe is to figure out that we don't have to keep paddling because there's no place to go. So we can set that paddle down and just relax.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not sure whether I should just sit cross-legged at home or journey internationally to Asia.

**Speaker C:** Well, maybe in traveling to Asia you find some people that are sitting around doing nothing. And you'll sit down with them and do nothing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I want to do. I'm thinking I'd like to stay at ashrams. Is that a— as far as I.

**Speaker C:** Know, there are no ashrams in Thailand. Well, that's not true. There are some. There's Ekkasan in— uh, uh, Erawan, rather, in Bangkok. And there's also another temple that I know of on, uh, Silom Road There's probably a few ashrams in Thailand tucked away, but most of the Thai people really don't know the difference between a wat and an ashram.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, I said, yeah, the concept of wat is new to me. But yeah, that's— if I'm going to Thailand, stay— I don't want to stay at ashrams, I want to stay at wats.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And there's plenty in Anagami, and they offer accommodations, do they not?

**Speaker C:** I would go so far as to say that in general around Thailand, that about half the people who live in a wat are lay people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and they're permanent residents, or Or transient residents?

**Speaker C:** Well, transient residents, in and out, 6 weeks at a time, maybe long term. Wats have gardeners and they have cooks and all kinds of things like that that people take those duties on and live in the wat. Neat.

**Speaker A:** And it's affordable. Everything in Thailand's quite affordable, right?

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** It's affordable. It's inexpensive with the right—.

**Speaker C:** I would say that if anybody charges you money, you pay that money and turn around and walk off. Do not pay for the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Really? Well, I think— I thought it was—.

**Speaker C:** Bodhisattva Dhamma is free. It's priceless. Putting a price on it devalues it.

**Speaker A:** Uh, well, not to pay for the Dharma. You're saying the Dhamma or the Dharma? The Dharma.

**Speaker C:** Well, you're putting an R in it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the Dhamma.

**Speaker C:** No need to put an R in it. That the R— the ones that have Rs in it is generally Sanskrit, and the ones that have no Rs is generally the old Magadhi language that is known as Pali.

**Speaker A:** Oh, cool.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so karma, kamma, dharma, dhamma, uh, uh, those kind of things, uh, uh, Saddha, Shraddha.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, Thailand is overwhelmingly, uh, let me guess, is it— I don't— I should know— is it Mahayana or Theravada? Terra Vada, overwhelming Terra Vada.

**Speaker C:** Well, let us say that it's about 95% Terra Vada. Actually, there's been an old history in this area of Thailand. 1,500 years ago, uh, it was a lot of Mahayana, and they're still digging up artifacts of Mahayana.

**Speaker A:** But virtually no Vajrayana in Thailand.

**Speaker C:** No, Vajrayana is actually a word from Tibet. Now here's something that is very interesting, and that is that many people see Tibetan and Zen and Theravada, etc. Very much like Christianity, with divisions and sects and Presbyterians and Calvinists and Catholics and Baptists all at war with one another, saying my religion is better than yours. But in the teaching of the Buddha, it's all more or less culture. In other words, you have the teaching of the Buddha, you have Buddhism, and then you have a huge amount of Tibetan culture. But the real teaching of the Buddha has seeped into Tibetan culture so that most Westerners can't see the difference between Tibetan culture and the teachings of the Buddha. The same thing is in Thailand. That people can come to Thailand and then they see that Buddhism, the teachings of the Buddha, has been melded with the old animism of the Thai culture from many, many centuries ago. But the teaching of the Buddha and Thai Buddhism are intertwined. The same thing with Zen, that in Japan, in Korea, and in parts of China, Okinawa, that area, you have the culture, the Japanese Okinawan culture, etc., and then you have the teaching of the Buddha that have come into that. You could think of it like this. Have you ever— uh, you probably did enough math in school to know the associative law of multiplication. Yeah, which is basically this associative law of addition. Okay, so A times B plus A times C means that you have the common A. You can pull that out, and then you have B plus C times A. Right, that's the associative law. Okay, this is the way of looking at Buddhism— is Buddhism A plus some culture.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right, um, a really good clear example of that is, is that the Dalai Lama in '66, '67, sometime in that time frame Actually, before the Chinese government got into a snit, the Dalai Lama was in Thailand to visit my teacher Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. We've got a video of that where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was teaching Paticcasamuppada to the Dalai Lama. Now in Thailand, Bhikkhuni is held in extremely extraordinarily high regard. As a profound teacher. And yet in the world, in the West, the Dalai Lama is the it's good, it's, and nobody knows much about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. But the Dalai Lama considered Bhikkhu Buddhadasa his teacher, his elder spiritual brother. And so if the Dalai Lama and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa can share that camaraderie, that kind of takes the mickey out of Thai Buddhism, Theravada, and Vajrayana, and Tibet. That Tibet is just culture. It's mandalas, it's a tokku, it's Oh, staring at images. I forgot what they call it. Uh, Tonkas. Okay, all of that cultural stuff was in Tibet before it became Buddhist.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, the, the Bon, right?

**Speaker C:** Right, the dead and the Bardo and all of that stuff is just old Tibetan culture.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And Westerners generally can't tell the difference between all of that Tibetan hopped-up and the actual teachings of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And after all, it was a Hindu, Padmasambhava, Guru Rinpoche, who really brought Buddhism to the Tibetans, right? Or Hinduism, yeah. Wait, was he a Buddhist?

**Speaker C:** Actually, you know, you could say that that Tibet was thoroughly, thoroughly Hindu for many, many centuries.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker C:** Or Buddhist culture, uh, Buddhist, uh, teachings came. Just like you can say, in fact, that, uh, you using the word Hindu loosely— and probably a better word to use would be animism.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, or shamanism, right? It all came from shamanism after all. Before there was any Buddhism, all the— any language, there was animism.

**Speaker C:** There was animism, right? They would worship anything. Yeah, they'd worship anything. In Thailand, they worship trees, and they'd worship spirit houses. And, uh, the, the theory is, is that the land belongs to the spirits, and if you come build your house there, you're taking away the land for the spirits. And so you need to build them a house too. And so that's why they have spirit houses in Thailand. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. That was old animism.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right. And Tibet was full of animism. Well, basically you could say even in India there is no such thing as an entity. Hinduism in the south, they have that one thing, and in the north they have something else. And yeah, oh yes. Okay, so you have monkey temples and you have rat temples and you have fire temples and you have Kali and Durga and Vishnu and Shiva. And in the old days, these guys were not all mixed together, they were just localized, uh, entities.

**Speaker A:** Ah, yeah, yeah, sure.

**Speaker C:** And so in that regard Laos and Cambodia and Vietnam and Thailand and Burma and Sri Lanka and India and Nepal, all in Tibet, all in the old days had a similar religion that we could put under the label of Ananicca. But we know the more common word would be Hinduism, but the Even the Indians don't like Hindu. That's a British term that was put on.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** So the teaching of the Buddha is actually quite radical to all of those teachings. Okay. And the big radical ratification is that all religions suck up to some deity, to Vishnu, Brahma, Kali, Jyota, all of that kind of stuff. And in Christianity, you have prayer for God and forgiveness and the Golden Rule. And taking Jesus as your savior. In Islam, they have the mercy of Allah and jihad and all of that kind of stuff. And it's always one's relationship with the big daddy up here, the daddy with the stick.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right. And that the entire teachings of the Buddha is the teaching there is no daddy with a stick. That's your delusion, and your relationship to the daddy with a stick is your problem. And if you give up your relationship to a daddy with a stick, you'll find out that you can live a very easy, happy life. No stick necessary. That's actually the coming out of the hard. The hard is the relationship with the daddy with a stick.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And when you give up the daddy with a stick and take on your own personal responsibility, you wind up having no responsibilities anymore. All those responsibilities came from your delusions about a daddy with a stick. That's the Dukkha, is the daddy with a stick that we're afraid of. Come out of your fears about a daddy with a stick and just relax. Everything's already okay. You already live in paradise. Yes, we're already there. Yes, that in fact, um, uh, there is the story— Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, by the way, really likes the story about, um, uh, Adam and Eve. Not the story that the Christians tell about a talking snake and whether the Eve did it with the snake or not. The woman did it first, and it was an apple, and God threw them out. He batted with a stick, threw them out of their paradise. Okay, then in fact, what they ate was the fruit, like the fruit of the loom, the fruit of your labor, the fruit of the loins. The fruit here means the results. And so they had to put up with the results. Of their knowledge of good and evil. This is good, that's evil. And so they create the judgment, they create the duality, they create then the god with the stick. And when we give up our judgments and just be okay, everything is fine, no problems, no worries, no judgments, then we find out that we're actually living in paradise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

**Speaker C:** All right, so give up all your striving, give up your fear. There is no daddy with a stick. Keep remembering that, that everything is already okay. You're just fine. Give up all your rules. In fact, the daddy with the stick is another way of saying, in the Pali language, it's Sila Bhanta Paramasa, our attachment to the way things are supposed to be. Our oughts, our shoulds, our woulds, our coulds, our supposed-to-bes, our idealism. And we go around looking at the world and comparing it with our ideal about how things ought to be, and we wind up feeling bad instead of just throwing out all of the woulds, shoulds, coulds, the daddy with the stick, and all of that stuff, and just be in your paradise. You're already okay. Take the soft approach. Get out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I love it. It's ironic though that my Pat— my, my, uh, Rudrananda, my root guru, he, um, he wasn't— he was not soft. He was not soft. Uh, but John Mann was soft. John Mann was soft. And, uh, incidentally, uh, I was acquainted with the brother of the Dalai Lama. He was a professor of linguistics at Indiana University where I was. And when he was a guest of Chaitanya Nanda at our ashram, but you know, I was young and not very well educated and I didn't know who the Dalai Lama was. I really didn't know who the Dalai Lama was. But I know who he is now.

**Speaker C:** And ironically, actually, what you know is his reputation. You don't know him.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't know him. But you know, I know— yeah, you.

**Speaker C:** Know of his reputation.

**Speaker A:** I know about the structure of the hierarchy. So I talked— his brother was telling— he would tell me about how his neck used to hurt meditation and how how long they'd have to sit. And the interesting thing is, like, well.

**Speaker C:** How long you have to sit is those who have a daddy with a stick, and they're striving, they're working. The Buddha didn't say to sit, not long periods of time. In fact, the instructions that he gave was go to the forest, go to a foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw, and sit down and start looking at what you're doing. Bring mindfulness to the fore. Recognize what thoughts you're having.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And change them. Put down your duties, put down your troubles, put down all of that stuff. And that it takes many people a long period of time. The reason they say it is a journey is because it's a journey to nowhere. And when they find out that they've gotten nowhere, they'll stop the journey.

**Speaker A:** Well, I have a slightly different take, if I may add. One fascination I have with the Dalai Lama is that he is the 13th Dalai Lama and that his practice is that of volitional reincarnation.

**Speaker C:** Dalai Lama does not believe in reincarnation. There's really strong evidence that you don't know about, but the obvious one that's public is he says he's not coming back. Have you heard that? Yeah, he says he's not coming back. He's finished with that toku. And there was some political reasons behind it, you know, in the 95-something, in that period of time, there was another one born called the Panchen Lama, and the chat— and the Chinese government kidnapped the kid and then.

**Speaker A:** Substituted him. The Chinese want to own this, uh, this lineage, right?

**Speaker C:** Well, they want to loan everything. That's the hard with it, is they want to own everything. Yeah, whatever they've got is not enough.

**Speaker A:** And so, um, that's very human, is.

**Speaker C:** To just want more and more and more and more. And so they, they did that. But when the Dalai Lama figured out that if he is reincarnated, that the Chinese will, uh, take that as an.

**Speaker A:** Advantage— oh yeah, I think, I, I think I understood that right. So I'm kind of obsessed with this concept of bodhisattvahood. And for me, meeting the brother of the Dalai Lama was like the first person I could point at and say, well, that guy, there's no denying that that guy's a Bodhisattva.

**Speaker C:** Well, let's talk about the Bodhisattva for a moment. The Bodhisattva is the one who strives. Bodhisattva is the one who wants— in fact, you probably heard the expression of May all beings be happy. May all beings be enlightened before me. And then I'll come in last. I've got a big job to do. Okay, now imagine that you've got 10,000 Bodhisattvas outside the gates of enlightenment and they've gotten everybody else in except for these Bodhisattvas. And now they start fighting with each other. You go next, you go next. I'm going to be the last one in. You see, the Bodhisattva trip. There's a big ego trip. And the, and the, uh, the beautiful part is, is that the gate to enlightenment is an open gate. It's like a swinging door. It swings both ways. Sometimes you're in, sometimes you're out. But the Bodhisattva is one who strives to try to help others That's the gate. That's the journey to nowhere.

**Speaker A:** You don't see yourself as a Bodhisattva?

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** You don't see yourself as a Bodhisattva?

**Speaker C:** I'm not sure what you're saying. You're asking me, am I a Bodhisattva?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** No.

**Speaker A:** You don't think so?

**Speaker C:** No, not at.

**Speaker B:** All.

**Speaker C:** Why should I want to be? I've given up all of that stuff.

**Speaker A:** That's what made you Bodhisattva, is your non-attachment and your wisdom and your fealty to higher power. Is it fair to say that you have fealty to higher power?

**Speaker C:** Absolutely not.

**Speaker A:** No, no.

**Speaker C:** The highest power that there is that I know of is my own mind. Nothing can affect this mind. And if something affects it, I can see that and throw it out before it actually does any effect.

**Speaker A:** But who— whose mind is it? Is it your mind or is it the Atman?

**Speaker C:** Not mine, it's just mind. It's just mine.

**Speaker A:** It's, it's the universal mind, which is higher power.

**Speaker C:** Well, I wouldn't say it's universal. But everybody's got one, all the humans at least. But in fact, the dogs that I've met and known, they've got a mind too. But just because it's prolific and all over the place doesn't make it universal. You see, you're kind of thinking that it's collective. The paradise that I live in— let's define God for a moment, because that's what you're actually talking about, is some higher power. And that's normally what we define God as, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, um, I would say it's equivalent with the eternal. It's merely the eternal.

**Speaker C:** But there is nothing eternal. Everything is changing. Anicca, Vata, Sankhara, Upadana, Anagami, and Dhammarato. Everything is changing, and it is— nothing is eternal. The god of the old Jews, Yahweh, and Allah, and, uh, uh, Elohim, and and, uh, Abba and all of those dudes keep changing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, they're manifestations of the universal mind.

**Speaker C:** No, they're manifestations of greed. They're manifestations of ill will. They're manifestations of human ignorance. People make that shit up.

**Speaker A:** You think It's okay to make it up if it's in good faith, is it not? Well, they acted in bad faith. If they have to— if they act in bad faith, if they ask on their own— I would rather them act.

**Speaker C:** Out of wisdom rather than faith. That faith is in fact really stupid. Faith is really, really stupid. Then in fact, that's what we mean by good faith.

**Speaker A:** I'm saying good faith. Good faith, meaning.

**Speaker C:** Uh, Well, the good faith is believing in things that don't exist, and bad things would be then that you could think that you could get away with doing anything because there's nothing that's going to stop you from doing bad things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, something like Crowley said. Hold on a second, my wireless hands-free is dying.

**Speaker C:** Hold on.

**Speaker B:** Oh, can you hear me now?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I can hear you. Okay, good. I can hear you. Yep. So I would not go for good faith and bad faith. I would go for see what's going on, to see things clearly, to see things with wisdom, to see the way things are headed, where they're going, rather than holding faith. I mean, here's an example of that. Uh, people have faith in Jesus as their savior. Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, have— what's his name— Christopher Hitchens. Have you ever heard of him?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, he's terrific.

**Speaker C:** All right, Christopher Hitchens has the, uh, perspective, and then in fact he's, he's got a challenge, and the challenge is name me one good thing me that a Christian or a religious person would do that an atheist would not do in good faith. And then the other side of it is, is that tell me a few things that Christians would do bad, that they would do things unwholesome, harmful, that an atheist wouldn't do. And the number of things that Christians will do in the name of their faith in God that is harmful, destructive, unwholesome is manifold. Yes, that an atheist wouldn't do. Yes. So this is the word that I'm talking about. You're using the word faith. Faith is the belief that basically I can get away with it. It's a get out of hell free card, and nobody gets out of hell free.

**Speaker B:** Oh wait, wait, wait, I was talking about good faith, which is very different than faith.

**Speaker C:** And that's what good faith is, is that I can go harm and damage and get away with it.

**Speaker B:** That's not good faith.

**Speaker C:** That's good faith. That's what good— that's what Christians have, is good faith. Well, those are not Christians. They call themselves Christians.

**Speaker B:** And by the way, if they're Trinitarians, they're not Christians, because Christ was a non-dualist. He practiced Advaita Vedanta, did he not?

**Speaker C:** Well, I don't know of anything about a Christ. I do know that there was most likely a historical Jesus who had a whole lot of good stuff to say. But when you call him the Christ, you're immediately making him into a magical, bad faith kind of dude.

**Speaker B:** Well, I just think of him as a Bodhisattva, one among many.

**Speaker C:** Well, he— let us say he stole— since you're talking about that He taught a lot of good stuff, but he did some really bad things.

**Speaker B:** What did he do bad?

**Speaker C:** All right, he broke into the temple and started wrecking the place. He threw out the bankers. He made enemies of the bankers. Now, if he had done things correctly, and I would assume that the Buddha would have gone and established a relationship with Caiaphas so that Caiaphas would listen. Hey, why don't you take all the bankers and money changers and put them outside of the temple? And that way the temple will be a more holy, sacred place. But oh no, Jesus went in there with a whip and a rope, and he started throwing the money around and overturning the tables. And within a week, he was dead. They crucified him for that. It wasn't because of his good deeds. They crucified him.

**Speaker B:** Is that why they crucified him?

**Speaker C:** Oh. Well, whatever the— I mean, that he didn't have any enemies until he did that, and he did it within a week of his death.

**Speaker A:** Is that right?

**Speaker B:** I don't think— I didn't— I don't— I didn't remember. I didn't— I'm not sure if I knew that.

**Speaker A:** Interesting.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the Christians don't want to— they don't like that story. They don't want to know that Jesus actually, um, basically was a criminal, misbehaved. He misbehaved royally, and they crucified him for that.

**Speaker B:** Hey, um, uh, do you like Ramakrishna?

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Do you like Ramakrishna?

**Speaker C:** I never met him.

**Speaker B:** Are you familiar with Ramakrishna?

**Speaker C:** I've heard the name. Oh, Rama, Rama, Rama, Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Murti. When I wonder, and Christ seems to be kind of the same word, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** I never thought about that.

**Speaker C:** It means somebody special, the anointed one. You're talking about the Ramayana?

**Speaker B:** No, Ramakrishna. He was Mid-19th century.

**Speaker C:** That was before my time, sorry.

**Speaker B:** He was famous for being loved by the Muslims, by the Hindus, and the Christians.

**Speaker C:** And the same thing was true with Guru Nanak, but we wound up with the Sikhs. He was 16th century, Guru Nanak, and he was trying to combine the Hindus and the Muslims. And what he wound up with is just starting a new order. Sikhs.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, so let me ask you, if I wanted to break the ice in Asia, would it be a good plan to fly into— are you— how far are you from Bangkok?

**Speaker C:** About 900 kilometers.

**Speaker B:** In which direction?

**Speaker C:** Well, you can't go 900 kilometers north, so it must be south. I'm in South Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Ah, south.

**Speaker C:** I see.

**Speaker B:** So I've been thinking that Bangkok is the place for me, partly because I want to play table tennis. I love to play table tennis.

**Speaker C:** You'd be better in Hong Kong doing that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, is that right? Uh, isn't it not that popular in Thailand?

**Speaker C:** I don't— I— it was all the time that I've been in Thailand, all of these years, I never heard of anybody playing table tennis.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker C:** Not as a big deal.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, interesting. Oh, Hong Kong's the place, huh?

**Speaker C:** Right. Well, Hong Kong is a whole lot better place for table tennis than, uh, let us say, the internals of China. But China used to be really big on table tennis.

**Speaker A:** Aren't they?

**Speaker B:** Are they not? Are they no longer?

**Speaker C:** I haven't been following. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I think it's still a national obsession.

**Speaker C:** Well, they've got several national obsessions. There's just a bit different national obsessions than, say, the US or UK or Russia. That's part of the problem with having nations, is that they have national obsessions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if I came into Thailand and.

**Speaker A:** Then—.

**Speaker C:** There'S a lot of wats and temples to visit in Thailand, in Bangkok. They call it the City of Temples.

**Speaker B:** So should I, should I try to visit India and Thailand at the same time, or should I make different trips? Is it too much to do both at one, in one trip?

**Speaker C:** Well, it depends upon how long that trip is. Are you thinking about 30 years for a trip?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I was thinking maybe a month at the most.

**Speaker C:** You probably get more done by locking yourself into a room for a month.

**Speaker B:** Well, if I was worried about— in.

**Speaker C:** A month you become a tourist. You'd have— I mean, a month is not long enough to really become a traveler. Ah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm— yeah, I'm feeling that. But You know, I guess I don't want to be away from my wife for more than a month.

**Speaker C:** Go ahead and waste. Enjoy your life. Why do you have to think that it has to be productive? You got some daddy with a stick making you up 2, 3, 4 and strive and whatnot?

**Speaker B:** No, I really don't.

**Speaker C:** I mean, what else can you do with time other than spend it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** People talk about making time. You can't make it. There it is right in front of you. Yeah, it's called the now. Ram Dass was big on be here now. I wrote a book by that name.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I read that when I was 13 years old.

**Speaker C:** Read it again. Be here now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** So where you are, be here. You don't have to go traveling to India or Thailand or anything like that, because all you're going to do is make yourself tired and more confused. Better to sit down and figure out why you want to go to Thailand and why you want to go to India, and recognize you don't need to go to Thailand, you don't need to go to India. What you need to do is nothing. You don't need to do anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess I— yeah, you know.

**Speaker C:** Life is easy when you stop doing all the hard stuff. I don't fly anymore. I used to fly, but I stopped doing that because my arms got tired of flapping.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess I had this feeling. I got somewhere— I feel like I want to— I want to travel to Asia before I die. But like you're saying, uh, okay, it's optional. It's not like I have to. It's like, if I can do it, fine. If I can't do it, fine, right?

**Speaker C:** Look at all the things that you want, that you want something, and that keeps you busy trying to get what you want. If you were already satisfied with everything, you wouldn't want to go anyplace, you wouldn't want to do anything. That you're already satisfied. When are you ever going to become satisfied? Could tell you what, you go spend a month or two in India or a month or two in Thailand, you're just going to come back with just more wants. Hmm. More places to go, more temples to visit, more Nepals and Tibets and Chinas and all kinds of places that you want to go.

**Speaker B:** Well, now you've ruined my evening. I hope you're happy with yourself now.

**Speaker C:** Well, I was happy before you called.

**Speaker B:** You know, that gives me great peace to think, you know, I don't have to do that. I don't have to do that. I don't have to do nothing.

**Speaker C:** You don't have to do anything. Relax and enjoy. You're already old enough.

**Speaker B:** You're another John Mann. Yeah, pardon me for saying— oh, I just, uh, appreciating that you, uh, you know, I love John Mann dearly, and I, I love you. I love, I love, uh, how you're so peaceful and, uh, spreading your joy and, uh, helping me to understand that, uh, just take it easy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, take it easy. There's no daddy with a stick chasing you around. Take it easy. Siddha, enjoy your carrots. Thank you. No place to go and nothing to do, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. That's Japanese haiku translated Bro. Yeah, don't worry, be happy. You don't have to worry about India, you don't have to worry about Thailand. You just sit down and enjoy your life.

**Speaker B:** Let's, uh, can we sit a few minutes, uh, silent, uh, meditation, just do nothing together?

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Let me get comfortable. Well, thank you so much for, uh, giving me some peace and, uh, helping me break my, uh, my, uh, you know, get off of the, uh, the exercise wheel.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, don't worry, be happy. Be happy. Everything's already okay. You live in paradise. You just judge it to be not paradise. It's not good enough yet.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's— I've been, like I said, the Bodhisattva been coming to me, and, uh, uh, I, I've been feeling really very, um, peaceful. Um, yeah, I've been feeling It's, uh, it comes to me. And, uh, I— but I needed, I needed to hear from you. This is, you know, I needed to hear it. And I appreciate— I thank you for, for telling me what I needed to hear when I needed to hear it. You're a beautiful man.

**Speaker C:** Good enough.

**Speaker B:** You're a great teacher.

**Speaker C:** Good enough.

**Speaker B:** I like that.

**Speaker C:** Good enough. Yeah, everything's just adequate. Everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** So beautiful, so calm, so peaceful. Well, thank you so much. I'm going to be seeing Michael in the morning, and I'll give him your regards.

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. And I'll see you around.

**Speaker C:** All right. Call again.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, sir. My money put my home.

**Speaker C:** UBI do me Gabby. Gabby Raspoon box on any shelves.

**Speaker B:** Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker A:** All right?

**Speaker C:** Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Have a nice afternoon.

**Speaker C:** All right, we'll see you. Thanks. Thank you.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and advice offered, primarily by **Speaker C (Dhammarato)**:

### **Core Teaching: The Hard Path vs. The Soft (Middle) Path**
*   **The Hard Path:** Characterized by striving, effort, goal-seeking (like enlightenment), austerities, and study. This is common among Western practitioners. The Buddha himself followed this path to its extreme (asceticism) before realizing it was not the way.
*   **The Soft/Middle Path:** The true path is one of **letting go, giving up striving, and "doing nothing."** It is the path of setting down burdens, fears, and judgments. Progress on the hard path only happens when one strives so hard that they finally **give up**, transitioning to the soft path.
*   **Enlightenment** is framed not as a goal to achieve, but as a twofold process: 1) seeing things clearly ("turning the lights on"), and 2) **setting down everything you see** (including the striving itself). The result is a light, cheerful mind where "everything is okay."

### **Practical Advice and Key Metaphors**
*   **Give Up the "Daddy with a Stick":** This is the core delusion—the internalized authority (God, rules, "shoulds") that creates fear and drives striving. True practice involves realizing there is no external judge, giving up that fear, and taking personal responsibility, which paradoxically leads to having no burdensome responsibilities.
*   **Tourist vs. Traveler:** A **tourist** has an agenda, schedule, and group. A **traveler** has no agenda and goes alone. The spiritual path is like being in your own canoe; you must figure out your own mind. You eventually realize you don't need to paddle because "there's no place to go."
*   **"Practice like your hair is on fire"** is reinterpreted. The hard path frantically tries to put the fire out. The soft path is persistent acceptance: "the hair is on fire, that's okay." It will burn out on its own.
*   **You Are Already in Paradise:** Suffering comes from judging our current experience against an ideal. The teaching is to **give up all judgments, "shoulds," and comparisons**. When you do, you see that everything is already okay; you're already living in paradise.

### **Responses to Listener's Questions (Speaker A/B)**
*   **On Travel to Asia:** Dhammarato gently challenges the listener's desire to travel to India or Thailand. He suggests the urge comes from wanting and striving. His advice: **You don't need to go anywhere.** "What you need to do is nothing." If you go as a tourist for a short time, you'll just return with more wants. Real work is done by "reading the book between your ears."
*   **On Buddhism and Culture:** He distinguishes the core of the Buddha's teaching from the cultural trappings it adopts in different countries (Tibetan, Thai, Zen). The essence—giving up the "daddy with a stick"—is radical and separate from animism, ritual, or dogma.
*   **On Bodhisattvas & Faith:** He views the Bodhisattva vow ("enlightenment last") as a subtle ego trip of striving. He rejects the concept of a "higher power," stating the highest power is one's own mind. He is critical of "faith," associating it with the potential to justify harmful actions and a "get out of hell free" mentality. Wisdom and clear seeing are paramount.
*   **On Practice:** Formal, strenuous sitting for long periods is associated with the hard path. The instruction is simpler: go to a quiet place, sit down, look at your mind, see the thoughts and fears, and **set them down**.

### **Overall Tone and Conclusion**
The talk is a direct, playful, and sometimes provocative encouragement to **stop all striving, give up fear, and realize that peace and adequacy are already present.** The listener is repeatedly guided away from seeking external solutions (travel, teachers, rituals) and toward internal relaxation and acceptance. The final message is one of contentment: "Don't worry, be happy. Everything's already okay."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker C) uses several core metaphors and stories to illustrate the central teaching of letting go of striving and embracing a "soft," effortless path. Here are the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors:**

1.  **The Hard Path vs. The Soft Path:** This is the central framework. The "hard path" is characterized by **striving, effort, austerity, study, and goal-oriented practice** (like working to "gain the skills well enough... so that you can drop it"). The "soft path" is about **"letting things go," "doing nothing," "giving up wanting," and "just sitting down."** The teaching is that the hard path inevitably leads to a point of surrender, where one transitions to the soft path.

2.  **The Middle Path:** Presented not as a compromise, but as the ultimate "soft way." It's the place between the extremes of relentless striving and sensual indulgence. It is explicitly defined as **"just sit down and do nothing."**

3.  **Enlightenment as "Light" and "Lightness":** A dual metaphor. Enlightenment involves:
    *   **Turning the lights on:** Seeing things clearly.
    *   **Becoming light:** After "setting all that stuff down," you become "lightweight, cheerful." It's a state of emotional and psychological lightness.

4.  **The Traveler vs. The Tourist:** This contrasts approaches to the spiritual journey (and literal travel).
    *   **Tourist:** Has an **agenda, schedule, group, ticket.** They are like passengers on a **big cruise ship**, going where the vessel goes. This represents following external systems and masses. "Tourists really don't get anywhere."
    *   **Traveler:** Has **no agenda.** The only place to go is "where he's headed." They are in their own **canoe or paddle boat**, free to navigate independently. This represents the personal, self-directed path.

5.  **The Flotilla vs. The Giant Vessel:** Extending the travel metaphor, the ideal spiritual community is a **"flotilla of canoes"**—individuals each on their own journey but headed in the same direction—rather than a **"giant vessel of tourists"** all locked into the same itinerary.

6.  **"Practice like your hair is on fire":** Re-interpreted through the soft/hard lens.
    *   **Hard way:** Panic, strive, "call the fire department."
    *   **Soft way:** Be persistent in acceptance—**"the hair is on fire, that's okay."** The fire (striving, urgency) will naturally burn out when not fought against.

7.  **The "Daddy with a Stick":** A powerful metaphor for **internalized authority, fear, judgment, and "shoulds."** It represents the source of our striving, guilt, and the belief that we need to be punished or forced to be good. The core teaching is to realize **"there is no daddy with a stick"** and that our fears and duties are self-created delusions. Letting go of this allows us to see we are "already living in paradise."

8.  **The Book Between Your Ears:** When asked what books to read, Speaker C advises to **"read the book between your ears."** This emphasizes introspection and understanding one's own mind over external study.

9.  **The Associative Law of Multiplication (A*(B+C) = A*B + A*C):** Used to explain the relationship between Buddhism and culture. **'A' is the core teaching of the Buddha.** 'B' and 'C' are different cultures (Tibetan, Thai, Japanese). What we see in the world is **Buddhism intertwined with culture (A*B, A*C)**, but the essential teaching (A) can be extracted and seen as common to all.

### **Key Stories and References:**

1.  **The Buddha's Journey:** Used as the archetypal example of the transition from the hard to the soft path. The Buddha first mastered intense concentration (Jhanas), then extreme asceticism (the "Starving Buddha") to the point of near death. He **"recognized that was not the way"** and discovered the Middle Path—the ultimate soft way of non-striving.

2.  **Adam and Eve (Re-interpreted):** Referencing Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's take. The "fruit" is not an apple but **"the fruit of your labor"**—the **results** or **knowledge of good and evil.** Being cast out of paradise is a metaphor for living in the dualistic world of judgment (good/evil, right/wrong), which creates the "daddy with a stick." Paradise is regained by **giving up judgment** and seeing everything as "okay."

3.  **Jesus in the Temple:** Used as a counter-example to the "soft" approach. Jesus acted from "hard" passion and anger, overturning the money changers' tables with a whip. This "misbehavior" directly led to his crucifixion. The implied lesson is that a wise, soft, non-confrontational approach (e.g., building a relationship with Caiaphas) would have been more effective and avoided harm.

4.  **The Bodhisattva at the Gate:** A story to critique the ego in spiritual striving. Imagine **10,000 Bodhisattvas** at the gate to enlightenment, each vowing to be last. They get stuck **arguing over who is more selfless** ("You go next!"), turning compassion into a competition. This illustrates how the **Bodhisattva ideal can become another "hard path" of striving and ego.**

5.  **The Dalai Lama and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:** A historical anecdote to dissolve sectarian divisions. The revered Dalai Lama visited and learned from the Thai Theravada monk Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, treating him as a teacher and "elder spiritual brother." This story reinforces the "associative law" metaphor, showing that beyond cultural trappings (Tibetan/Thai), there is a shared core teaching (A).

**In summary,** the talk uses metaphors of **paths, vehicles, travel, weight, light, and parental authority** to contrast a mindset of effortful *doing* with one of accepting *being*. The stories of the **Buddha, Adam & Eve, and Jesus** serve as archetypal lessons, while the anecdotes about the **Dalai Lama and Bodhisattvas** aim to cut through cultural and egoistic attachments to point toward a simple, effortless peace that is "already here."
