### Transcript


**Speaker A:** One of them was that I was not doing the practice good enough. So every time I have some like really subtle doubt, I just remember there is no like practice. I can just relax and there is nothing to do. Like I don't have to do something good enough. So that's helpful. And yes, so I've been playing with this. So, so far it's going great. And so there is no like actual problem or question.

**Speaker B:** And I think you froze. Okay, I have to, uh, now you're fine. Back, I had to turn the Wi-Fi on because, uh, we have a network now in a power outage. There is no power here, so everything is operating by batteries, uh, and I've got a, uh, uh, uninterrupted power supply on the router, so we're going to work with the, uh the Wi-Fi from the router because the electronic switch that I have for the Ethernet is not on that UPS. And so we lost the internet, but the laptop still has a battery. So I don't know how long it'll last, and I don't know when the power will come back. We've had a lot of power outages lately. And in fact, on Sunday, it went up and down, and it happened long enough, coming back and forth, that we were actually able to finish the call. But I think that this laptop only has about 30 minutes of life on its own. So, we'll just have to continue on with that. So, in any case, one of the things that we can talk about, again, is the hindrances kind of in hindsight, because you're beginning to understand. In fact, that was a very good point that you made, is that the doubts, the questions, and all of that kind of stuff will come up. And instead of just seeing those as hindrances, the student will often dwell on the questions, and the questions that he keeps asking himself is preventing him from feeling good. And being able to see those questions and those doubts and all about how to practice is just keeping you from enjoying the moment. Yes, we can throw those questions, just set them right down. I don't have to have the answer to that. I can feel good now without knowing all of that, whatever I was asking. And that is so remarkable. So I want to congratulate you for that. That's really, really good to be able to just set all of those questions down, to recognize that that too is just a hindrance. And it actually goes quite along with the point about ignorance. The Buddha talks about ignorance a lot. You can see that. And when we say ignorance in English is translated out of the Pali, Anagami, which is not a wrong understanding. And so, we have to understand that it's got various ramifications, this word ignorance. Because it actually does include denial, stupidity, and wise ignorance. There is such a thing as wise ignorance, and that wise ignorance is that you don't know, and you know that you don't know, and that you know that it doesn't matter that you don't know. That's the best, that's the point that's the best part of it. And a clear example of that would be rebirth. But people get all wrapped up into rebirth and reincarnation, and the fact is, is that at that level that people want it to be, not the level that the Buddha talks about, which is when, in fact, when the doubt comes up, the doubt is reborn. That's a kind of rebirth. But when we think of it in the sense of past lives and future lives and life after death and all of that, we have to expect at least one thing. And that is, is that we don't know. We're ignorant of that. And that we will not know, perhaps we won't even know after we're dead. In fact, when we are alive, we don't know, because we're not dead. But when we're dead, we don't know nothing. So we don't know either way. And in that regard, it doesn't matter. Because we don't know. Because whether there is rebirth or not doesn't depend upon what I'm doing right now. And if I am doing something wholesome and valuable and good right now, then whatever afterlife there will be, it will probably be okay too. Yeah, this moment has any influence on. But the important point is that we don't know But now that we don't know and we see it has no value to us, we can also say, well, and I don't care.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** That's the really important one, is I don't know and it doesn't matter, so I don't care. And that's how we can begin to practice. When we can do that with rebirth, we can do that then with almost anything. It's like that's big one. And when we recognize whether there is an afterlife or not is completely unimportant to how I'm having this moment, that it actually is completely irrelevant, way off into the future. But then we recognize, well, wait a minute, we don't know what any of the future is going to be, so it too becomes irrelevant. So I don't have to ask myself self-questions about the future, or the Dharma, or the past, or anything else. That getting ourselves into that state of questioning is not wise ignorance, it's got a habit, it's got greed mixed with it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, it's very subtle. It's like sometimes you have just a question about Dhamma and you think it's okay, but it's very In a very subtle level, you get a bit of an discomfort, like a physical unease, like just a small bit. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We can We can see those thoughts and recognize that whatever it is, even if it seems to be an immediate Dharma question, it's really not. That we really don't have to have the answer to it right now. If we were okay 10 minutes ago without the answer to it right now, then we're probably okay without the answer to it right now for the next 10 minutes. That in fact we were okay before we thought of the question. We were okay before we thought of the question, and now that we thought of the question, now we got to have the answer to it, rather than just being able to set it down. And this happens often with beginners in their practice, to recognize we don't need to ask questions. But in fact, if there is a time for a question, it's when we know that we can get some sort of decent answer. So when you're with the teacher, for instance, that's a good time to ask a question. But when we're sitting alone in practice, that's the time to recognize that, "Hey, the questions themselves are just indicating doubt, that we can just set aside right now and have fun instead.".

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, so there is time for questions.

**Speaker B:** That we don't need to know the physics of the teeter-totter, all we need to know is how to ride. And so this is the first thing to say about that, and to again congratulate you for recognizing that these doubts that we have are really a hindrance to our practice, and that we can set this stuff down, as well as all of the other hindrances. Because surprise, surprise, all of the other hindrances are interrelated anyway. When we talk about the hindrances, think about it in the sense of a pie, a pizza pie. And when that pie is sliced up, Then each of the pizzas have a slice, but if you let those slices sit there after they're sliced, they're still just part of the pizza. Okay, if we can understand the hindrances that way, then we can see that doubt actually creates on its own a kind of fear, a kind of worry. And now we don't like the state that we're in. We can work ourselves up. With just little bits of doubt, into a real pity party. And so the hindrances are all interrelated, so it's really better for us to catch it quickly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true. I've never seen it like this, but yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right, so once we're able to see that, then we want to start to maintain that watchfulness, that we can get ourselves away from the hindrances and recognize that most likely what's going to come back is just another hindrance. And so we want to start being on guard. This is what we mean by guarding the thoughts. And this is actually part of the practice that is— we can think of it in the sense of applying the mind means to apply it to the wholesome, and then sustaining it means that we sustain the wholesome by not letting those hindrances come back in. And so, applying and sustaining, and applying and sustaining, means that now we get that ability to have that satisfaction begin to grow and to build up. And as it grows and builds up, it also begins to change the attitude that we have. We begin to get the attitude, "We can do this." So, the doubt is now being replaced by confidence. The ignorance is still there, we don't know the answer to the question, but the feelings about it all is, as you said, we're changing it from the doubt, which would be the attitude of a victim, into confidence that what we do know is correct, that we've got enough. We know enough.

**Speaker A:** And sometimes I've noticed it's not that I have to change like a full-on thought. It's just changing my attitude. For example, I noticed that I'm just switching my attitude from victim to confident. And that makes me feel better. I didn't have to like switch like a train of thought. And that was interesting, just switching this. Yeah, it's very subtle.

**Speaker B:** The way that you're saying it is actually quite correct. And that this is actually where we're taking this is that we do, in fact, by practicing just being okay, even if we don't have the answers, we're still all right. And keep practicing that and practicing and being satisfied, then that doubt then is being replaced by confidence. That the victim's attitude of doubt is now being converted into the attitude of a lion, the attitude of can-do, the attitude of being successful. And so this is where that part of the Eightfold Noble Path comes in, that Samma Sanghappa, means that we can actually develop that as a skill. And that the skill that we want to use it in the term of the skill, is— Robert's sending a message. All right. And so, this skill that we're developing is actually called Piti. It's a skill to be developed. And if we understand what it means, it means that we're actually intentionally really enjoying something, bringing the mind almost into a state of ecstasy or exaltation, to have an exalted mind, a mind that's really, really up there, and to recognize it. In the Sutra No. 10 in the Satipatthana Sutta, in this evaluation and investigation of the mind, There's a lot of tidbits that they talk about. But the thing of it is, is that all of this stuff fits together in a very interesting way. And that is, is that by gladdening the mind with language, we begin to feel. And by the way that we feel, which is the feeling of Sukkha, Anicca, And then Piti. That state of Sukkha, and especially the Piti, actually changes the state of mind that we're in. And so that the mind itself becomes exalted. The mind itself becomes top-notch, because we feel top-notch. We feel exhilarated. And so we can actually practice that, to see that satisfaction leads to success, and success is like the "wow" that happens. That one of the ways that we can talk about it actually is in the example of, that you're very thirsty, you're very, very hot in the desert, one sand dune after another, and then you go over the next sand dune and you find an oasis, not a mirage, a real oasis, you know it's real, because it's got palm trees and camels and tents and girls in hoochie-goochie clothing doing a belly dance. And it's all of it is there and you know it. And so here you are running down there to get that drink of water that you're so thirsty. Okay, this knowing that you're going to get it is what we're talking about, that you know that you've got it. Many, many examples of that, like winning a race, making a touchdown. The star athlete, he knows he's got it, and that moment of thrill, that point of exhilaration, and you know that you can do it. This is what we're talking about, is that peak moment. There's qualities of that peak moment in the sense that It is conditioned. We conditioned it that way, and it is also temporary. It could possibly stay at that pinnacle, just like no one builds a house on top of Mount Everest. They go up there, they beat their chest, they take a deep breath, and they'd better be off that thing before nightfall because it's going to get nasty at night. Yeah, right. And so this is also those Anicca, the peak pinnacles of the mind that we go through, the exalted states of mind that we go through are temporary, but at least we begin to know how we can create them. Those two are not given to the culture. Normally, in fact, a way of talking about it is, why do people go to football games, spend maybe $100 on a ticket? Because they want to see the score, their team score. Why? Because they get in that exalted state. They raise their hands in the air and they cheer, and they really, really like that thrill. Yeah, other people will do that. In fact, um, uh, guys who, let's say, go on a lot of dates because they want that thrill of knowing they're going to get laid. The laying itself is a kind of a bother, but knowing that you're going to get it, right? This is the way of thinking. That in fact, one of the things that I did, as a confession, was that I took interviews for jobs that I had no intention of taking that job, but it was the thrill of being offered the job. And so I actually went on a number of interviews where I had no intention of taking the job. I just wanted the thrill of them offering me the job. That's an unusual thrill, but that was one of them that I that I did. But we go around thrill-seeking, okay? And what we actually can understand is, is that we can control those kind of feelings intentionally, that we can feel as good as we want to feel, that we can take and meet that high moment, that in fact there's things that we can say, and if we understand it correctly and see it truly. An example of that is 'Hahuna Matata,' which is 'no worries for the rest of the day.' I mean, we can get to the point of getting Sukkha from 'no worries.' Right now there's no problem, but no worries for the rest of your days. It's like it's over. Wow! You know, that's that kind of top kind of top-notch feeling that we don't have any worries for the rest of my day. Don't have. All right, so this is, uh, uh, or that, that sense of coming alive. Another example would be that if you were getting choked to death, or maybe you were drowning and something really heavy was pulling you underwater, and there your last breath has gone out, and you know that you're about to die. Then all of a sudden, the weight is cut loose, and you pop back, right back up to the surface, and you get that breath, that exhilaration. There's many places in that. In fact, there's one of the reminders of that is the, uh, um, uh, the Count of Monte Cristo changed places with the corpse. And they threw the corpse over the side of the high ledge or ridge into the ocean below, all tied up in this sack. And he had to get himself free. And he almost drowned. This almost drowning or almost dying, but we don't quite die. Getting choked or getting drowned, and then we get that release. And you feel, "I'm alive!" This is the quality that we're looking for. You can think of it as a sense of relief, but it's the grand release, the grand relief. Now, this is not necessarily a one-time shot. Once you begin to practice this, you recognize that you can have it almost any time you want it. But you don't want it so much anymore. The real issue is that you know that you can feel any way that you want to, that we no longer have to go thrill-seeking on the outside world. We know precisely how to put ourselves in any state of exaltation that we like. This is the practice then of the That's why the Buddha was known as a lion, because that was the attitude that he decided that he was going to take on. He took on the attitude of a lion. And so keep practicing, practice well. This is the direction that you're going in, that once you get free from the hindrances, you can actually begin to concentrate or focus on, or let us say, start repeating over and over and over again, that you're safe, you're secure, you're comfortable, you're satisfied, and you're successful. And you're successful. You're successful about controlling your feelings. You're successful, and you begin to feel really good about how successful you are. And every time you practice doing that, it gets you just a little bit higher in the air, until pretty soon you can feel like a gold medalist just won a gold medal at the Olympics. Yeah, except for one thing, and that is, since the 1930s, there have been thousands and thousands and thousands of people making gold medals. So they're getting kind of ordinary by now. But being able to sit down and feel like you've just won a gold medal, that's unusual. Much more unusual to be able to control those kinds of feelings. The gold medal itself, not so important. That may impress other people, but you know how it feels to get a gold medal, because you're the one who gives the gold medals out anyway. That's the way of understanding it. You're in control here. You can feel the way that you want to. So, let's start working with that, bringing that level of satisfaction up to at least the level of success. Wow! You can do it! In the passages it says that there comes a point when the student says that no matter how, right now, that the mind gets hindered, we can throw that obstruction out and come back into this state of seeing how nice things really are right now. That's an important point, is to understand that no matter what kind of state we get our minds in, Robert, we can get it right back out again. All we have to do is remember Who's the boss here? That we can in fact just get it back together. We can throw that stuff out and say we're okay, we're fine, we're safe, we're secure, we got the door locked, everything is okay. We're snuggling in bed with the puppy and we feel really, really good. We can become satisfied. 'Right here, right now, everything is okay, everything is fine.' And then we build on that. 'Wow, I can do this. Even at a tense moment, no matter how obstructed the mind gets about relationships or anything else, I can throw that stuff out and be successful at getting my mind back into a state of joy.'.

**Speaker A:** One big thing for me was to— sometimes I felt stuck in the state, like I couldn't come out of it. And every time I was starting to have thoughts like, okay, now I'm stuck, or I cannot get satisfied right now, I would notice this and see it as an hindrance. And that let me have the state Anagami, and the state that I was looking for, but also being mindful of not wanting it too much. But especially seeing that I was starting to tell myself, oh, I cannot get satisfied anymore. This one was a very important one for me.

**Speaker B:** Right, so that's a hindrance that's going to prevent you from being able to enjoy it and wanting it instead of recognizing that you've got it right now. You've got it right now, okay? And, and, uh, and the confidence that, yes, and we can do it again, rather than I want it next time. We say, I know I can do it next time. I don't have to want it at all. I can just enjoy it now. So that's the— these are these subtle little steps of we're talking about, of coming out of the victim into the, into the lion, into the winner's position. Wanting what we've got is something that a loser does. Enjoying the heck out of it is something a winner does.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so this is the way we practice, of bringing that mind back into that exalted place of, "This is good, this is fine." And to know that the mind is in that exalted state, and feeling it that way. That's the practice, and we practice it over and over and over again, till we get good at actually being able to get into that state Literally talking ourselves into it. Rather than talking ourselves into feeling bad, we talk ourselves into feeling safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, successful, and then exalted. Another way of saying it is wealthy. Stinking rich with joy. And so this is the progress, and I see that you're quite on the way to it, and that you can continue on with your practice in this direction of safe, secure, satisfied, comfortable, satisfied, successful. Go for that success. You got it, you got it. You know you could do it. No worries, no worries, mate. Not now, not ever. Begin to finish this off. Feel really good at it, that you're getting good at it. That's the way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see where the next, I mean, the remaining hindrances could be. It would be thoughts like this good feeling is temporary, or I'm knowing it right now, but maybe I cannot do it later if I let too much hindrances come back.

**Speaker B:** Not with these thoughts. Not with these thoughts, I'm not. For me. And so that's the whole thing, is being able to see those hindrances. Aha, I caught you. I caught you saying I can't do it later. Of course I can do it later. I can do it now, I can do it later. Yeah, yeah, bringing up that confidence higher and higher that you know that you can do this even when you're having a bad moment or a bad day. Never mind, you can throw that stuff out of the mind and come back into that safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, successful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker B:** So, I'll let you both go, we'll practice this.

**Speaker A:** Alright. Thank you, Fred.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** See you, Arhat. Bye-bye. Thank.

**Speaker B:** You, guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Dhammarato (Speaker B)** in dialogue with a **Sangha friend (Speaker A)**, focuses on overcoming doubt and hindrances to cultivate a joyful, confident, and exalted mind. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: From Doubt to Exalted Confidence**
The central teaching is about transforming the hindrance of doubt into confident, self-generated joy. The practice is about learning to feel safe, satisfied, and successful in the present moment, regardless of unanswered questions or external circumstances.

### **Key Lessons**

1.  **Doubt as a Hindrance:** The initial insight from Speaker A is that subtle doubts about practice ("am I doing this right?") are themselves hindrances. The solution is to relax and realize "there is nothing to do" and nothing to achieve "good enough" in that moment.

2.  **Wise Ignorance:** Dhammarato expands on this by introducing the concept of **"wise ignorance."** This means consciously acknowledging "I don't know" (e.g., about rebirth, the future, deep Dhamma questions) and, crucially, realizing **"it doesn't matter"** for your present well-being. This allows you to set aside endless questioning and feel good now.

3.  **Hindrances are Interconnected:** Doubt is not isolated. It is part of the "pizza pie" of hindrances—it can quickly breed fear, worry, and a victim mentality. The skill is to catch these thoughts early and guard against them.

4.  **The Attitude Shift:** The practice is less about changing specific thoughts and more about **shifting your underlying attitude**—from a **victim** (doubtful, worried) to a **lion** (confident, capable). This shift in attitude naturally changes how you feel.

5.  **Cultivating Exalted Joy (Piti):** The talk guides toward actively cultivating an **exalted state of mind (Piti)**. This is done by:
    *   **Verbal Cues:** Using language to "gladden the mind," repeating phrases like "I'm safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, successful."
    *   **Relief & Success Imagery:** Drawing on the profound feeling of relief (e.g., being saved from drowning) or the thrill of success (e.g., winning a race, finding an oasis) to access that "peak" joyful feeling.
    *   **Internal Control:** The ultimate goal is to realize you don't need external thrills (sports, dates, job offers). You can generate this exalted joy internally, at will, by knowing you are in control of your own mind.

6.  **The Cycle of Practice:** The method is **Apply and Sustain**:
    *   **Apply** the mind to wholesome, joyful thoughts.
    *   **Sustain** it by guarding against the re-entry of hindrances.
    *   Each success builds confidence, creating a positive feedback loop of satisfaction and skill.

### **Practical Advice**
*   **Timing Questions:** Save doctrinal or practice questions for a teacher. During solo practice, recognize questions as doubt-hindrances and set them aside to "have fun instead."
*   **Combatting "Stuckness":** When you think "I'm stuck" or "I can't get satisfied," recognize *that very thought* as the final hindrance. Catching it allows you to re-access the joyful state.
*   **The Boss of Your Mind:** Remember "who's the boss here." No matter how hindered the mind gets, you have the ability to throw out the obstruction and return to a state of safety, satisfaction, and success.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is an encouraging guide to moving beyond the intellectual traps of doubt and using the mind's own capacity for joyful affirmation to build unwavering confidence and inner wealth. The path is one of progressively replacing the victim's doubt with the lion's roar of self-assured, exalted well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker B, likely a teacher) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate the teachings on doubt, hindrances, and cultivating a joyful mind. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**
1.  **The Pizza Pie / Hindrances as Slices:** The five hindrances (doubt, aversion, restlessness, etc.) are compared to slices of a single pizza. While we talk about them separately, they are interconnected parts of a whole unwholesome state. Letting one "slice" (like doubt) sit allows it to affect the others.
2.  **The Victim and the Lion:** This is a central metaphor for the shift in attitude. **Doubt** is framed as the attitude of a **victim**—passive, worried, and lacking control. The practice aims to cultivate the attitude of a **lion**—confident, powerful, and in charge. The Buddha himself is cited as an example of adopting the "lion's" attitude.
3.  **Thrill-Seeking / External vs. Internal Joy:** The desire for answers or certain states is compared to common forms of **external thrill-seeking**:
    *   Going to a football game for the thrill of your team scoring.
    *   Dating for the thrill of the chase.
    *   Going on job interviews just for the thrill of being offered the position.
    The teaching contrasts this with learning to generate that "thrill" or exalted joy internally, at will, making external seeking unnecessary.
4.  **Gold Medalist:** The practitioner is encouraged to cultivate a feeling of success so profound that it's like the feeling of **winning an Olympic gold medal**. The key twist is that the practitioner learns they are the one who "gives the gold medals out"—they are in complete control of awarding themselves that feeling of triumph.
5.  **Building on a Peak vs. Visiting It:** An exalted state of mind (Piti) is compared to reaching **the peak of Mount Everest**. The point isn't to build a house and live there (states are temporary/Anicca), but to know you can get there, enjoy the view, and—crucially—know how to return.

### **Stories and Vivid Examples**
1.  **The Desert Oasis:** The practitioner is like a person dying of thirst in a desert who crests a dune and sees a **real oasis** (with palm trees, camels, etc.). The exhilarating *knowing* that relief is at hand—the certainty of success—is the feeling to cultivate.
2.  **Near-Death Release:** Several examples evoke the intense joy of release from mortal peril:
    *   Being **choked or drowned** and suddenly being freed to take a breath.
    *   The story of **Edmond Dantès in *The Count of Monte Cristo***, who escapes death by being thrown into the sea in a sack, cuts himself free, and surfaces gasping, "I'm alive!" This "grand release" is a metaphor for the relief and joy of letting go of hindrances.
3.  **"Hakuna Matata" (No Worries):** The phrase is used as a direct example of a thought that can induce a "top-notch feeling"—the exhilarating realization that there are **no worries for the rest of your days**.
4.  **Snuggling with a Puppy:** A simple, domestic image used to illustrate a state of **safe, secure, and satisfied** contentment that can be a foundation for joy.
5.  **The Boss:** The teacher asks, "Who's the boss here?" This is a story-in-a-question, reminding the student that they are in control of their mind and can choose to "throw that stuff out" and return to a state of well-being.

### **Summary of Metaphorical Themes**
*   **Hindrances:** Interconnected slices of one problem (pizza), weights that drag us down (drowning).
*   **Practice Path:** A journey from being a **victim** (lost in doubt) to becoming a **lion** or **gold medalist** (confident and joyful).
*   **Joy (Piti/Sukkha):** A **thrill** of success, a **life-saving drink**, a **grand release** from danger, the feeling of **winning a championship**, having **stinking rich wealth** in joy.
*   **Control/Authority:** You are the **boss** and the **awarder of gold medals**, not a passive recipient of external conditions.

These metaphors and stories work together to make abstract Buddhist concepts like hindrances, Piti, and right attitude tangible, memorable, and practical for the student.
