### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so you look frozen. Did it freeze you? Okay, all right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** uh, Joe, uh, what you were mentioning, um, is that when ordinary people come together, they will do ordinary things unless there's someone there that can redirect or re-guide them. And that the answer that you had immediately would be that when you see people criticizing, our natural response is to criticize them, saying, oh, don't criticize.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** There may be another way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that is, is that when you come out of your own critical mind, then you can deal with people in a critical mind state non-critically. And by doing so, you can invite them out of the mind state that they're in. And there's many, many different little techniques and tools that we can do that to bring some humor into it. For instance, when the people are complaining about, oh, let us say, the city's transportation or whatever it is that they're complaining about in the moment, one of the things can be said is, oh, ain't it awful? Wow, I'm glad I'm in this room where everything is okay. And see what they say with that one. They may get— some of them will get the point and others not. Okay, but ain't it awful about whatever you're complaining about out there? Ain't it awful? Wow, aren't you glad that we don't have that problem in here right now? In other words, you're inviting people to think, investigate for themselves, to look into it. But if you tell them what they're saying is wrong, they're going to get their back up. Just like they did when they were in diapers and their older sister told them what to do. So getting your backup is actually learned behavior, just like complaining is just learned behavior. And so it's your job to wake up to that and recognize that you've got a choice. And by you having a choice, you can change your attitude, and then with your new change of attitude, display that with the invitation, oh, you can have this attitude instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that would be something that a skilled Dhamma dude, Dhamma teacher, would do, would be direct— redirect them away from their complaining into that right now is okay. But nobody bothered to do that. And in fact, in many of the meditation retreat places like that, the person who set up the meditation retreat or the weekly group is the one who does some of the complaining.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so she's— because she's in charge or in whatever like that, we're giving the nod or the okay for other people to remain mundane, rather than continuously inviting people out of the mundane into the supramundane. If you can do it yourself.

**Speaker B:** That's the challenge.

**Speaker A:** It's all a matter of remembering to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And taking the right effort. And since you've been taking the right effort over and over again and remembering to do it while you're sitting alone in seclusion, that means that you now can begin to remember it when you're, let us say, in a snake nest called a meditation class.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I find that when I stop myself, if I find that I I am in that situation and I realize, okay, I'm potentially going down something that is an unwholesome path, I'm going to stop myself. I kind of freeze and I don't really know what to say sometimes. And then it sort of becomes an awkward moment or something because I don't, like, I can't think. I'm like, okay, there must be something wholesome or good that I can say. How can I say something really nice or wholesome here in this time? But then it just comes out as like forced or unnatural. And

**Speaker A:** here's the thing, that's because you're trying to deliver to them a gift that you don't have.

**Speaker B:** Right? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you deliver them the gift that you do have instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if I'm still— It is not well received.

**Speaker B:** Right. If I'm still— I mean, I'm obviously still in Dukkha, you know. So if I'm still there, what do I have?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you don't like the fact that you're complaining and you want to fix them.

**Speaker B:** Well, I want to help. I mean, mostly I want to— if I see somebody who's really stuck, I don't know that I want to complain. I just want to be helpful to them, like I hope people can be helpful to me when they see something in myself that is clearly— But you

**Speaker A:** may be ready for hearing things that some people are not ready to hear things. A little example of that is that one of the students was saying that He ran across a phrase in a book that really struck him. It was a really, really big point, and then he wanted to share it with his dad.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And I cautioned him, be careful that that particular line out of the book had influence for you because you had seen it over and over and over and over again. And now you're seeing it stated in a new way and you get a big aha because you've got a trail going. But when somebody hears something for the first time, then they don't have any history with it at all. And so they're not going to have the value of the repetition. That that's in fact one of the key points that I make about the Dharma is that it has to be repeated over and over and over again within one's mind. That's what Sati is about. That's why taking another deep breath mindfully and taking another out-breath mindfully, because we start to develop those skills over and over and over again. So now you're talking about being in a conversation with people And whatever it is that you would like to share with them, they're not going to get it the first or the second or the third or the fourth time you say it. Okay, that it has to be said over and over and over again. And that one of the major messages that you actually want to give— hello, Emmanuel.

**Speaker B:** Hi, Manuel.

**Speaker A:** Hello. So one of the messages that you want to send to these folks is that it's okay right now to be happy. And the best way to send that message is by it being okay to be happy right now with you. And then you could call it in the sense of sharing your joy.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** does that make sense to you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** You really don't— you don't have to fix them. Yeah, what you can do is maintain your own joy, and then you can share your joy with them. And if they're, uh, into picking up on the joy, then they'll stop complaining, or they may in fact start complaining in a more wholesome, joyful way. For instance, like, they'll come to that point of, yeah, ain't it awful? Wow, our government really sucks, ain't it awful? So this is a way of working with them rather than trying to give them the brutal truth or criticizing them for criticizing, because that's a little bit hypocritical.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it generally doesn't work.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** That a much better way is, is that they can't touch you with their criticism, that you're really great. Just because they're criticizing something or another doesn't mean they're criticizing me. That is, always when, when we see somebody shooting bullets, we stand up and stand in the way so that we can catch one of the bullets. That's what's called selfishness. Yeah, okay. But the reality is, is that whatever they're complaining about, they're probably not complaining about you. So why should you care whether they're complaining or not? They're not complaining about you. But when we say, oh, they should not be complaining, that means that now we're getting really selfish about it. That we're judging them, we're actually in a way complaining about them complaining. Yeah, but a much better way of seeing it is, is that, hey, they can't touch me. Whatever they're doing is not— no problem for me. I'm good to go. I'm fine. And so now I can, uh, deal with them in a happy, healthy, uh, wholesome, friendly way. And then you can begin also to start asking questions, like, instead of talking about all the things that you're dissatisfied with, do you have any things that you are satisfied with? And see if we can get the conversation turned around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we do it by several methods, and one of them mainly is— or one of the primary tools is asking questions. To get people to look at what's going on, what they're doing. If you point it out to them, they don't want to hear it, they don't want to look at it, they don't like the fact that you're rubbing their nose in it. Nobody likes that. And so the better way is to be above it all, to be aloof. To be supramundane, that you don't have to be a target of the arrows and slings of outrageous fortunes that are coming out of these people's mouths. They're not talking about you, so why should you care whether they're complaining or not? If you have the idea, "Oh, well, they're suffering by their complaining," but Wait a minute, if you go and complain to them about your complaining, aren't you just joining their pity party?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I use the analogy sometimes that you're on a boat, a big boat, and someone falls overboard and they're screaming and hollering, "Help! Help! I can't swim! I can't swim!" Most Westerners, understanding that the situation, will jump in too. They'll join in. Why is that? In other words, in our society, we say misery loves company. Or let's have a pity party, or someone is angry, they want other people to be angry. But in fact, when people are complaining and commiserating with each other, they actually— some people will intentionally go to the meditation place so that they can complain and get someone else to agree with them. Because people by themselves, when they're complaining, get tired of it. They know that they're lying to themselves anyway. But if I can go and find somebody that I can commiserate with, now we can have a big pity party. Misery loves company, or birds of a feather flock together. And they want you to join in there and commiserate with them. And here you are pointing out that they're complaining and complaining about it. And so that's what they— what we could say is they came there looking for pleasure. If you could give them some pleasure because they came for pleasure, but they're not really getting any pleasure out of doing the complaining, but you can give them some pleasure. You can give them a smile, you can give them a happy nod. You can— well, I'm glad that I don't have to deal with that problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wow, you're a really tough girl for putting up with that kind of boyfriend, or whatever it is that she's complaining with. But you can always do it happily and joyfully, amusingly, make a joke out of any and everything to let them see for you that everything is really light-hearted. By it being light-hearted for you, you can invite them for it to be not so much of a problem for them. That they can become lighthearted also. This will work in any situation, but it requires skill. What is the skill? Number one skill is to remember not to jump into their pity party. Don't jump off the boat just because they jumped off, right? That's the first one. They're inviting you to come have a pity party with them. Don't do that. You have to remember to wake up, to say, oh no, I'm not going to go into that cesspool, I'm going to stay above it all. And then you can remember, then once you have that Sati, to gladden your mind. And one of the ways of saying it, wow, that's not much of a problem after all. I mean, it's not really that bad. Or another way of saying it is, yeah, well, it's not that bad because it hasn't changed. It's been bad like that for a long, long time. What to do. And so we begin to make light of the problems because there's really no problems there. And when this audience that you're talking about understand that, and you could say just a couple of happy words here and there, and if there is someone who wants to take over, then that will be an invitation for them to get their whole program back on track. So these are some skills that you can develop, and it's all just a Bonobo path. There's nothing there to do but to practice the path, or to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off and then start practicing the path again once we get off the path. And just by the fact that these people are coming to a meditation class indicates that they're wanting something out of the Dharma, right? But that's different than walking into, say, a school board meeting where they came to complain, right? Getting those people out of their complaining mentality is really a lost cause. They're coming to a meditation class and just complaining and complaining. They already know that that's not the best thing to do. And so you don't have to rub their nose in it, but you can invite them out.

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure. I was going to say, I'm not sure that everybody— because I know at times when I was first going to meditation groups, I had an idea of what meditation and all this was. That wasn't necessarily in line with the reality that I've experienced. So I'm not sure that that's like 100% true, that everybody is there for what you're saying, because they might be there for a different reason. They might be there because they think that it's just going to be really relaxing and really peaceful, and there's, you know, and that's

**Speaker A:** Well, then they're going to be the star of the show, aren't they?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but if you're able to do that. But I'm just saying, if you come there and you come with all of your real-world problems, then you think, okay, if I just sit here, then I'm going to just be extremely peaceful naturally without having to do anything in my mind at all. Just by noting my emotions, I'll naturally become peaceful. Like, I don't know. I mean, it works sometimes, you know, but, you know, I'm just saying because depending on the meditation technique or whatever idea that it is,

**Speaker A:** that you can

**Speaker B:** come into a meditation group for a lot of reasons is what I'm saying. And sometimes the reasons aren't necessarily— yeah, at least some of the people that I've— when I've had meditation groups, people come for all sorts of reasons. You know,

**Speaker A:** so actually a better way of looking at it is, is that people go to those meditation places and there's only ever one reason for anyone to ever go to that kind of place, and that is they're looking for something. Now you're detailed on what are they looking for? But the real issue is that they come looking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so looking at that commonality that they come there for, looking for something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then, uh, if what they find is your joyous laughter, your beautiful face with a big smile, then they don't recognize what it was that they came for. But if they hear a bunch of gossip over at the corner and they go listen to that, then they'll think that this is what I came for.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the fact that people coming for something doesn't mean that they really know what it is that they're looking for. If in fact they knew what it was that they were looking for, they wouldn't be in that class.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, if I knew what I was looking for, that, you know, I mean, this is— we're talking in general, but, you know, if it could sink in for me too, then— Yes, that's what

**Speaker A:** I'm saying, is that this is an opportunity for everybody. Yeah, that this is not just your opportunity, it's an opportunity for everybody. If you can get a happy smile on your face and in the face of whatever it is that's happening then that will kind of uplift everybody. Just like we can take one person who can drag the whole group down, one person can also uplift the whole group. And so practicing from that perspective, that your job is to stay in a really, really good space, to get yourself into a good space and stay in that space. And you actually came to a meditation class. I mean, what other reason is there to go to the meditation class other than getting yourself into a good space and staying there for a while? Yeah, the only other option would be to be in that, or to get yourself into a good state and remain in a good state without the meditation class. You don't have to go there. But a lot of people think that they have to go to the meditation class to get that, and then they wind up gossiping instead because they're doing what they know how to do. You know how to do that. You too, you know how to do that. In fact, that's your general— your answer to their complaining is for you to complain about their complaining. See how common that is?

**Speaker B:** I have a question about— because you mentioned like getting into a good state and staying in it. And sometimes I notice in my mind, like I just think about it because it was this morning that I— it's like my mind plays tricks on me where it thinks, okay, that like that trick that you have for keeping yourself in a good mood. It does. It's not going to work today. Like today, today it's not going to work today. It's just, you know, you're just going to feel horrible, like, like physically horrible.

**Speaker A:** And guess what? There's no trick to it. That's the thought you choose to have right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so I just have to, but I'm just thinking because can you wake

**Speaker A:** up to see that that's the thought?

**Speaker B:** I stopped myself then. So I had this thought and I stopped myself then. But it's really difficult sometimes. I mean, is it?

**Speaker A:** No, you stopped it one time, you can stop it again. The really difficult part is when you get the attitude that this is too much work, I can't do it, I'm a loser, I need help. You become a victim and that's when it becomes very hard.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But when you have the attitude, oh, there's that thought again, never mind, I see it again. I can handle this. Yeah, because those unwholesome thoughts are going to keep coming up and coming up and coming up and coming up. When will you finally succumb to them and let them win? Everybody does it very quickly. The question is, is can you resist and resist and get on top of it and ride that horse and, and not let the horse throw you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** But you have to keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back, even in the face of other people are inviting you to practice your very favorite bad habit: complaining.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, that's much of what meditation is all about, is learning how to stop complaining. That is a major, major feature of the Buddha's path, that in fact we can say that not only are complaining unwholesome thoughts, they're also a particular kind of critical thinking. At least in ordinary critical thinking, you have the criticism in the sense that this is good and that's better, I like this, I don't like that. And we have division in there, and this is okay and that's not okay according to criticism. This house is big, but that house is bigger. What complaining is doing is destroying everything. I don't care what it is, it's no good because that's the mentality that we have. The mentality is that I'm in a complaining mood, and so any topic that you raise, I'm going to complain about it. Unless I'm around someone who is going to be laughing at my complaints and is going to kind of, okay, never mind, it's not a big deal, everything is okay. But now that we know that that's a favorite habit of your own, is complaining within your own mind, having critical thoughts, we can be on guard for that. So that whenever your critical thoughts come up, we can catch that and say, hot dog, I don't have to have a critical thought right now. I can have a happy, joyous thought instead. I don't have to go around thinking about all the bad stuff. I can sit around, think about all the good stuff instead. That I can count my blessings instead of my woes. Yeah, complaining is just complaining about all of the dangers and all the problems of life. But people don't live that kind of life 100% of the time. If they did, they'd die early. No, we're all a combination of up and down. But if you have a choice about it, you can choose whether you're going to go up or going to go down. The choice is yours, if you can remember to take the choice. And then you have to take the effort to make that choice. That's one of the reasons why it's good to go do this in seclusion, is because now you don't have that uphill climb of dealing with other people complaining, and you can only— and then you only have to deal with your own mind doing the complaining.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you could reduce the amount of complaints just by getting away from other complainers, so that the only complainer you have to deal with is the one you brought into the seclusion with you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** and then we could start dealing with that complaining every time it comes. Aha, I see you, Mr. Complain. Yeah, you like to complain a lot. I've seen that. We're not even complaining about the complaining. We're just noticing, ah yeah, there it is, there's that complaining again. But I don't have to complain about my complaining. You could just accept it. Yeah, there it is. And guess what? I don't have to do that right now. Wow, what a joy it is to not complain for a little while. But the complaining is going to start up again. Are you going to complain about it the second time? The first time you were able to deal with it successfully, but when it comes a second or a third time, are you going to use that skill that you developed in the first time to deal with it again, or are you going to finally succumb to it? Oh, I gave it a good shot, I gave it my best. I was able to manage it once or twice, but it got me. And guess what? We're complaining now. So wakey wakey, wake up to the fact that it's very easy for us to start complaining again. And then we can say, never mind, start again. Let's come back into— I don't have to complain right now. I don't have to be worried. I don't have to have any goals that I'm missing or have achieve, I could just relax. Everything right now is okay. And when you get that kind of sense of well-being, you can walk into the meditation retreat place already feeling that way, rather than going to the retreat place to get into that state, only then to wind up complaining to other people about them complaining. Yeah, the best thing to do is to walk in there with your mind already fixed. Yeah, and then you could really get a kick out of it, joyfully, happily. So this is an important point to remember. You've got a choice at any moment. Are you going to choose to complain, or are you going to choose to enjoy the show? Everything's all right, everything's fine, just enjoy the show. You don't have to fix anybody, you don't have to stop people from complaining, you don't have to complain about their complaints. Just everything is okay, everything is easy. And so these are the kind of thoughts that we want to cultivate— wholesome thoughts. Everything is all right, everything is fine, nothing to complain about. In Australia they say, "No worries, mate." In Thai they say, "Mai mi panha." But in English, we always have something to worry about, always got a problem to solve, always something to fix. So we're in Thailand, "Mai pen rai." Anapanasati. My pen rai actually means nothing is awry or nothing is broken. No issues, nothing. Everything is okay. So this is kind of mentality to start cultivate, but we cultivate it from the position of everything's okay because I make sure that it's okay, that I've got the power. That's my choice. I choose that this is going to be okay. Everything's fine. And then we can relax. Oh wow, I've got no work to do because everything is okay. Even in the meditation hall where they're complaining, you still have nothing to do. Everything's okay. They're obviously enjoying themselves. They're complaining because they— that's what they like to do. They're just doing what they normally do. Except that if you get caught up in that, then you start complaining too, and you already recognize that it's painful to criticize because you're there criticizing them in a painful way. And so you know all about it. Yeah, but you only know about it enough for you to avoid it. And that's the place that we have to start. We can't fix the world in order for you to be happy. That you can't force all of those people to shut up so that you can have some peace and quiet. So no need to complain about them complaining. Just enjoy them. And if they— if

**Speaker B:** You froze there. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Well, Skype died, but it's back alive.

**Speaker B:** How is it back now? Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything's all right. So, uh, Joe, Manuel is here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, hi Manuel.

**Speaker A:** He's downstairs. He just arrived yesterday or so and he's been out today.

**Speaker B:** You're in Thailand?

**Speaker A:** He's at the house. He's right here. He's downstairs.

**Speaker B:** When did you arrive?

**Speaker C:** Like 5 days ago.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And where did you come from?

**Speaker C:** Germany.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker B:** Is it your first time there?

**Speaker C:** So your face is like, it's like dripping.

**Speaker A:** Very difficult to hear you.

**Speaker C:** Oh,

**Speaker B:** so I think it's breaking up a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Can you hear me okay like that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit better.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, speak up, but I don't hear you.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, yes. So it's my, it's my second time in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** The first time I'm traveling alone in Thailand. The first time I was with my friend. And are, are you enjoying it there? Very, very

**Speaker A:** Things are beginning to open up now. This month was the first time that they've done retreats at Deepapawan, and Emmanuel got here just in time to miss the retreat that started today on Koh Samui. Sylvia, how to catch the next one?

**Speaker C:** I actually caught the next one.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker C:** I caught the next one already and I'm going.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you want— book the next one, I think is on December 10th,

**Speaker C:** is that— December 11th, yeah, I already got the contract.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good.

**Speaker B:** That's great. How long is the retreat for?

**Speaker C:** 7 days.

**Speaker B:** 7 days, did you say? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There are 3 retreat centers very close by. One of them is within a kilometer or 2 of here. The other one is up on the other side of the island, or actually not too far from here. And the one that we're talking about is on the island next door on Koh Samui. And it's the first to open. Then in fact, I was just asking Karuna about when is Anthony coming back from Finland to open the retreat center here on the island, and we don't have any information yet about that. But things are beginning to open up here on the island. We've got businesses.

**Speaker B:** Which island are you on?

**Speaker A:** Koh Phangan. Okay. Kopanan.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Kopanan.

**Speaker A:** The Thai people pronounce it that way because that's how it's written, but the Westerners always pronounce it Koh Phangan, but Koh Phangan is wrong. It's Kopanan.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** so we've got retreat centers here, and there's also retreat centers on the mainland, but COVID has just stopped everything and has for so long. But it looks like that by the end of the year, many of the resorts and facilities here on this island are going to be opening up. Okay, then in fact, Manuel was able to come to Thailand and only have to spend one night in quarantine, which is brand new.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's great.

**Speaker A:** Before, anybody who came into Thailand had to quarantine for 2 weeks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There's been a recent outbreak, but the outbreak here in Thailand does not come from international travel because they're very careful about that. The problem is coming from people from Burma coming into Thailand to get away from how bad the COVID situation is in Burma that we don't know because there's no news. But it assumes that, number one, they've got no vaccines. They've got no government interference, no one is wearing masks, there are no medicines, the hospitals are— I mean, they're literally in Burma, it appears they're doing nothing except just letting people get sick and die. And a lot of those people are trying to escape from Burma to get to Thailand. And they're bringing the disease with them. And so that's why there's outbreaks in Thailand, is because it's coming from Burma. And Thailand and Burma has a long, long, long border, like 500 or 600 kilometers of mountain and river and that kind of stuff. So it's actually quite easy for people, if they really want to, is to come over illegally. We don't have no walls. Donald has not been in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** And Manuel, how did you decide to go to Thailand?

**Speaker C:** I was interested in checking out Thailand, just like that. And I was just interested also in finding a place to go on a retreat. And I thought my best chances would come here and see what's happening.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, have you been practicing like on your own in Germany for some years, or do you have a Sangha there too?

**Speaker C:** No, I didn't have a Sangha, but I've been practicing for since 2017, I guess, when I had my first retreat in Sydney, Goenka Vipassana. And after that, I had another Goenka retreat, but That's it when it comes to retreats. But I've been practicing on my own.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Like that.

**Speaker B:** Well, sometimes it can be more effective to practice on your own than being at a retreat anyways, in my experience. But it depends on the retreat and the settings, but you can set up really like, you know, you can set up nice like self-retreats and stuff like that and set up your life to be relaxing. And yeah, at least that's my attempt.

**Speaker A:** I think that we can actually thank the COVID situation for that. In the sense that Buddhism coming to the West seems to have gotten very, very retreat-oriented, right? Like, you ain't had no meditation until you spend $2,000 on a 10-day retreat. You know, that's the kind of mindset. But COVID has almost put 10-day retreats out of business in the United States.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Uh, which is a good thing because that means that people can figure out that they can practice on their own and they don't need those kind of meditation retreats.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** As a veteran of meditation retreats, I don't recommend them.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, for a lot of years I've been trying to set up my life kind of to be less— yeah, to try to be on retreat all the time. That's the goal anyways. Like, I live in the countryside and I don't meet so many people.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker B:** yeah, I mean, you guys are like my social interaction.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, that's true for the vast majority of those who do get into the Dhamma, and they don't have the skills for themselves to maintain it. No one of us does. No, I know, because the training from childhood is just too strong.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker A:** But getting into community and helping each other, then in fact, one of the qualities of the Sangha is to help each other come out of our own personal wrongdoing that we are delusional about, thinking that it's okay to do that when in fact it's not. Like you're talking about complaining.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you can see that, oh, when those people do the complaining, I don't like it, therefore it must be bad. But when you yourself do it, you don't even recognize that you're doing it too. Yeah, until someone can point that out. So you're pointing out— I'm pointing out to you what you were wanting to point out to them. If you can point it out to them the way that I pointed it out to you, everybody's going to be really happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I definitely see the value of Sangha for sure, and helping to keep you on track and working towards the same thing. And the other kind of ironic thing is sometimes trying to set up this sort of life like this that's a little bit more relaxed and enjoying is sometimes I've found, wait a minute, I'm off track a little bit. I'm not really doing what I'm just not practicing, you know, and you just realize that you just sit there and you're like, wait a minute. I mean, I'm not I'm just not practicing. It's just not happening right now, even though I have great conditions for doing it.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but part of the reason for that is that all of the people that you are around in your daily life, except for this one time when you go to this meditation class, almost all of the people that you— all the people that you deal with are ordinary people. And so their invitation to you is to join them and to be just like they are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I mean, in my life, the way that it's set up, I really don't meet many people. I mean, I'm a farmer, and so I mostly am working at home, I really don't meet that many people at all. Like, that's just the reality.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's actually great for the present moment, but there's also all of the people that you brought onto that farm with you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in my mind. I know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in your mind, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** I'm well aware of that. Okay, so in that regard, it's better for us then to have new people who have wholesome points of view. It's good for us to associate with Dhamma dudes, as opposed to ordinary people. That in fact, since the time of the Buddha and all along since then, the whole idea is for noble-minded people to collect together and live together. This is what a commune or community or a wat or a Vihara or even just a spot out in the woods where the guys collect together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That we have this quality of associating with those who will be of benefit for us, as opposed to associating with people who are not going to be of benefit for us. And we all operate that way. The question is whether we're going to use wisdom rather than our greed to decide who is going to be of benefit to us. Because if we want to associate with wealthy people because we may be able to get some of their money somehow, if they're stupid and it leaks out of their pocket, I'm going to be there to pick it up. And so a lot of people go around looking for friends that way. We, in fact, have language for that. One is called gold digger and the other one is called gigolo. But we have people that are commonly wanting to associate with people that are more wealthy than they are, hoping they can get some benefit from it. But that's not very wise. What we really want to do instead is find really high-quality, first-class people and then hang around them, because then some of their goodness may leak off, may rub off, may fall out of their pocket intentionally or so. And so this is what the quality of the Sangha is really all about, is that we can gain benefit from others who are actually also practicing, but not maybe experts at the very thing that we're trying to practice. That I remember in high school that some of my best friends were also piano students. That the guys who played the piano, they knew each other. Some of them had the same teacher, etc., like that, or they went to the same church, or knew each other from band, or something like that. And so this is what we mean, is that we can, in fact, if we are careful, if we select, we can find good wholesome friends. But we often just take whatever is available, because we're kind of lazy. But you can, in fact, cultivate good friends. And that's what I'm promoting here, is to find some of our friends here that are actually practicing the Dharma, because we can help each other do that. We could point out each other's mistakes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And one of the mistakes that we could point out is, hey, you don't have to feel bad because you made a mistake. You could feel good because you can learn a good lesson from that mistake. So if you, if you make a mistake and then don't like that mistake and want to hide from it, now we've made two mistakes. But if we deal it correctly, then the mistake that we made is actually a teacher. Thank you very much, I learned a lot from that one. And so we can continue to make that choice about, am I going to be joyful even when I've made a mistake? Even if I've hurt somebody, I can joyfully go get forgiveness. But in our society, we use words like sorry. An apology has to be a downer. I have to say I'm sorry. In other words, I already feel bad. Please don't punish me to make me feel even worse. I already feel bad enough. Maybe I feel bad enough for you so that you don't have to make me feel bad. I already feel bad. Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And so that's what's expected of us, is to feel bad. To where you don't have to. You use your choice. You can screw up and feel good about it. Yeah, I saw that. Aha, I see you, Mara. And then we can learn something from it. And this is one of the reasons why we want to be around Sangha, is because the standards in the Sangha are so much higher. We begin to pay attention to what's going on because other people are doing the same thing. But if you go hang out in a bar, you're much more likely to become an alcoholic than you are a saint. If you go hang out at the Army base, you're more likely going to be angry and uptight than if you hang out at the bar, which will be drunk. I mean, it's your choice, but wherever you hang out, that place that you're hanging out will rub off on you, as well as the people that you hang around. Your quality will rub off on them, just as their non-quality, they'll try to rub that off on you. So your choice is to say, no, I'm going to remain high quality. But the better way to do that in the beginning is by associating with other high quality people until you get into the habit of it, get used to it. And then you could deal with anybody in that high-quality way. So again, we're talking about the value of the Sangha. The Sangha is a key ingredient, that if we cannot develop spiritual friends, then what value is our practice anyway?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But if we do develop spiritual friends, then that means that we'll develop a friendship with the spiritual being within us. We can become friends within. We can become friends within, we can become friends without. But if we're constantly around other people who are complaining and not being so friendly, then It's hard to pick up friendship from them. It's better to be around other people who know what they're doing, who are already wise enough to invite you in and give you a nice wholesome conversation rather than a complaining conversation. All right, but we started this with the foot on— or the shoe on the other foot. And that is, how can you walk into a meditation place where you're expecting to find Sangha, and what you find is a bunch of people complaining anyway? Where what we really need to do is to go in there with the idea of creating a Sangha even inside that place which is not used to having a Sangha. In other words, your job is to make friends with these people, right? That, in fact, those may be the very best people for you to try to make friends with because they've already said publicly that they're wanting something out of meditation. They're already there for it, right? I mean, this is not the same thing as putting on a billboard, 'The end is near,' and walking down Main Street trying to convert people. You know, let's be more clear and more careful about who we're going to communicate with. So in that group, we got three levels. We've got the level of the nobles that we want to learn from, and then we have the ordinary people who were there to learn how to become nobles, and then we have general society. And general society does not want the Dhamma. Therefore, trying to give the Dharma to members of normal members of society is, as the joke goes, it's very much like trying to teach a pig to sing. It frustrates the teacher and it really annoys the pig. So let's be careful who we're trying to get to sing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the best place to go to get people to sing is guys who already have a gusto singing voice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And those are the guys that you want to go hang out, the nobles. And this is why we're developing this whole concept of online Sangha, is for us to mutually support one another in our own spiritual growth, which means that we need to do a bit of confrontation with each other from time to time. Just like I did with you, in the sense that you were complaining about people complaining.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I had to point that out. Yeah, because that gives you a great deal about— you can't in fact blame those people for complaining anymore because you're doing the same thing anyway. We're all in this mess together now, aren't we? Yeah, I know, because I've done a fair deal of complaining myself. I still do it sometimes. It's fun. But not often enough to where it's painful. And so we have to be very careful about our complaining. But in any case, this is the whole quality of Sangha that we're looking for, is that we can gain enormous advantage by dealing with people who are better than we are. At whatever level that we're speaking of. So someone who wants to learn to play chess, he joins a chess club, right? Because he's going to go play with people who really know how to play chess, right? Yeah. So, uh, and you go into a meditation class, that's the right place to go. Everybody who went to that meditation place were going to the right place. They just all happened to bring their own baggage. With them. But that doesn't mean that you don't want to go to these meditation places. No, in fact, you could say that you're— you go there to practice meditation. Guess what? The real practice then that needs to be done is practicing dealing with people who are complaining, and that's how you'll gain skill. So go there to the meditation retreat meeting with the intention of practicing meditation, Anapanasati, practicing having that wholesome mind, even in the face of other people who would rather complain. Sorry, I have to keep saying the same things over and over and over and over again. Nothing new here. It's all the same. What do you think, Joe?

**Speaker B:** It makes sense, yeah. What do I think? I think that I should try that. I should just keep trying is the only thing that I can do, really.

**Speaker A:** Actually, trying has the quality of failing in it. Why don't you just do it?

**Speaker B:** Just do it.

**Speaker A:** Just practice doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because it's not that hard. I mean, there's nothing to fail at. All you have to do is remember to do it. And I mean, how easy is it to smile? You've been doing that for your whole life, just not often enough, right? Because we have to remember to do it. So that's the way of thinking about it, is that yes, that's an amazing opportunity for you to practice Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I still find it difficult though. I know it's just theoretical, but it's— if somebody has like serious emotional things going on or something, like say they're suicidal or they've gotten divorced or something like that, and hearing people talk about that, that as a human I struggle to ignore it, to ignore it kind of, or not— you're not really ignoring it, but I I just don't know what to do in those situations. And it often comes up in meditation groups that people are like, man, I have no other place to talk about this. I have to talk about how depressed I am and I want to kill myself.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's the whole point then. That's amazing opportunity for you to ask questions like, well, why do you keep thinking about it? Why do you want to talk about it? Why can't you find something useful and valuable and wholesome to talk and think about?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Why think about suicide when you can think about howdy doody or going to the movies or going to see McDonald's, Ronald McDonald, or whatever? I mean, I love the Muppets. Why do I have to think about killing myself? Yeah, so we can change the subject with that. That's the whole point, is that if people coming into that meditation place to complain Yeah, get them to at least get, you know, get that off their mind for a few moments.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Hey man, don't do it here. If you're going to kill yourself, why don't you go off to the bridge someplace? If you fall— I mean, if you jump off of our ledge, you'll just land. There's only a foot. Go to a bridge or something and jump off. Or the way that psychologists have done that, and I know— I even know of one psychologist that actually keeps a real gun in his office, because he's not messing around. So when one of his clients come in suicidal, he hands them the gun and say, I want to watch,

**Speaker B:** let

**Speaker A:** me see you do it.

**Speaker B:** I guess nobody's taken him up on that yet.

**Speaker A:** Never happened. But in fact, that's probably the very, very best intervention that there is for suicide. Or the one that's very close to it is, wait a minute, let me out on the ledge with you and we'll hold hands and jump together. And that always wakes people up. Wait a minute, I don't want you to die too. It's just me I want to die. Well, why do you want to die too, you know? And then they begin to start waking up and recognizing that what they're thinking about is stupid, right? And so the point is, is when they walked into that meditation hall with thoughts of suicide, they brought a problem that doesn't exist in there with them. Those problems don't exist. There is nothing there that's worth killing yourself over, right? That's delusional thinking. And so if you are in fact going to go to this meditation place and you are running across people like that, then you could be their savior just by laughing at them. Huh, suicide? What a stupid thing to do. Here, sit down and enjoy lunch with me. Or suicide? Hey, I want to watch. Are you sure you're going to do it? I mean, are things really that bad?

**Speaker C:** I think so many people make this thought pattern of, I want to kill myself, I am so depressed, so much to themselves that when they are being confronted with something like that, okay, well, go ahead. Actually, they are being attacked. Something in themselves is being attacked and they don't want to let go of those patterns, of those thoughts.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right, that we cling to something. Almost always, suicide is a kind of revenge, that we want to be dead so that the people who were around us causing us to feel like that we wanted to die, they'll feel guilty. They made me do this. They'll feel bad. I'll be able to— I don't know how to get back at them any other way other than doing myself in. Or in order to get back at the CEO, the only way I can get back at him is by destroying the entire company and putting 500 people out of work. But at least I got him. Okay, so this is the way of suicide, but that's also the way of complaining, that often the people that we complain about are never harmed. They never hear about our complaint. But the people who have to listen to that complaint are the ones who are being harmed.

**Speaker C:** And there seems to be also a social norm that sort of encourages this sort of empathy that when I imagine a situation like, oh, you're suicidal, well, go ahead. Then everybody would think, oh, you have no empathy. Like, why don't you empathize with that person? I think that's why there is a lot of discouragement to maybe react in such a direct way.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but guess what? The only people who will make that kind of statement are the ones who would in fact like to watch. Or voyeurism, or another way of saying it is they commiserate with that person. They're on his side. Oh, he feels so bad and wants to commit suicide. And I feel that bad, too. And if I was complaining and wanted to commit suicide, I don't want anybody to tell me that they want to watch and be happy and joyful about watching me commit suicide, because I'm really in a bad mood to commit suicide. So those are the ones who will complain about that, is the ones who already are commiserating and want to feel bad themselves. And so now they're complaining about you being joyful. Talking to somebody about to commit suicide, and they don't even recognize that that's the best intervention. Joy is the best intervention for any bad feelings that I know of. I don't know anything that's better, a better cure for anger rather than joy. I don't know any feeling better, uh, there's an antidote or a cure for grief other than joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** An example of that is, is that, oh, poor grandpa, he died and I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to him. Oh, boo-hoo. And he walks up to the Dharma dude in that mood, and the Dharma dude will say, hey, I remember your grandpa. He was a really great guy. I remember we went fishing together and all of that. And so now we can have that joy about grandpa rather than grief. Why do we have to have grief when he died? Why can't we celebrate his life? Instead of commiserate over the loss of him, his death. So it's all that way. We all— I mean, we can change anybody if you have enough juice. If you— if, in other words, if you bring a syringe full of joy, you may have trouble getting that person inoculated. But if you bring a fire hose and you start spraying them with your joy to where they are just completely overwhelmed with it, then naturally it's going to affect them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that's one of the things that I really enjoy doing on the internet or on Skype here, is to Worked with students who come on with, you know, 'Oh, poor me, and my life sucks, and what can I do about it?' And within 3, 4, 5 minutes, I've got them laughing to get them out of it. And that's the whole teaching, is to come out of our negative thoughts, come into happy, joyful thoughts, one after another after another, and our life becomes wholesome and joyful.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so now can you take that back to the meditation class and share your joy with others? And that's what Sangha is all about, is going around sharing our joy and bringing people out of their misery. And sometimes we have to point out their wrongdoing that got them into that misery so that they can say, oh, I don't have to do it that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but you can't do it by criticizing their criticism. That just doesn't work. No, it doesn't work. But you could be joyful instead. And then if you're joyful, it doesn't matter whether you get them to be joyful or not. You've got joy. They can't touch you. They can't pull you back down into their complaining mentality. You won't let them do that. That's why it's a skill to be developed, and this is the development of that skill. Do you have the strength of mind to be happy when you would rather, deep inside in your instinctual being, want to criticize them for criticizing? Where's your joy? Let's bring them on that. Yeah, let's get some happiness here. Let's never mind about all of that stuff. The world is out there being fixed by hundreds of millions of people are out there doing a 100% best effort repair job on society, and they all wake away from that job every day feeling guilty and sad and disappointed because they can't fix a broken world. Guess what? World ain't broken. What's broken is our attitude about the world. World's an amazing place. It's wonderful, full of all kind of crazy nutcases. Quite a show. Up to you, your choice.

**Speaker C:** In my experience, it's not something to sort of create ideas about or think about. So complaining about, oh no, why am I not having this positive energy right now? Why am I not positive right now? But it's rather thing of practice thing, and that it's just joy is a sort of a byproduct. There's no need to worry about,

**Speaker A:** I

**Speaker C:** don't know, not feeling that joy.

**Speaker A:** We have a lurker here. His name is Green Tanha. Green Tanha, are you on? Are you here with us?

**Speaker B:** I've actually got to get going, and I'll try to carry the message of joy forward. Yes, I'm not going to try, I'm going to do. Excellent.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I was about to wrap up. That's why I was inviting Grintana to to say hello. Okay, but this is a good time for us to finish this off, and I really have enjoyed our conversation, uh, Joe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, me too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, been repetitive, but that's how we do it, over and over and over again, same thing until we get it. Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, Manuel, we'll see you in 5 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Nice to meet you, Manuel. And if I don't see you before your retreat, uh, good luck on your retreat, and I hope I hope that it goes really well. And yeah, okay, see you guys.

**Speaker A:** See ya, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends Joe and Manuel, centers on **how to skillfully deal with complaining and negativity in social settings, especially in spiritual communities like meditation groups.** Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem**
People often come together and fall into habitual, "mundane" patterns like complaining, gossip, and criticism. Even in meditation groups, participants might unconsciously create a "pity party" instead of cultivating wholesome states.

### **The Unskillful Reaction**
The natural, unskillful response is to **criticize the complainers** (e.g., telling them, "Don't complain!"). This is hypocritical (complaining about complaining), creates defensiveness, and simply joins the negative energy.

### **The Skillful Path: Invitation, Not Confrontation**
The core teaching is to **first stabilize your own mind in a joyful, "supramundane" state** before engaging. From that place of inner well-being, you can skillfully invite others out of their negativity without being pulled into it.

**Key methods include:**
1.  **Humor & Reframing:** Lightly acknowledge the complaint and redirect attention to the present moment's okay-ness (e.g., "Ain't it awful? Wow, I'm glad everything's okay in this room right now.").
2.  **Asking Questions:** Instead of pointing out their "wrong" behavior, ask questions that prompt self-reflection (e.g., "Do you have any things you *are* satisfied with?").
3.  **Sharing Your Joy:** The most powerful tool is to simply **embody and radiate a joyful, unshakable attitude.** Your stable happiness becomes an invitation and a living example.
4.  **Don't Take the Bait:** Recognize that their complaints are not about you. You don't need to "stand in front of the bullets." You can remain untouched and compassionate.

### **Underlying Principles**
*   **Choice & Effort:** At any moment, you have a choice to feed wholesome or unwholesome mental states. It requires continuous **remembering (Sati)** and right effort.
*   **Repetition is Key:** The Dhamma must be repeated internally to build the "muscle memory" of skillful response. Don't expect others to get it the first time.
*   **The Purpose of Sangha:** Spiritual friends (**Sangha**) are crucial for mutual support and gentle confrontation. They help us see our own blind spots (like our own tendency to complain) and encourage us to maintain higher standards.
*   **Joy as the Antidote:** Joy is presented as the ultimate antidote to negative states like anger, grief, and even suicidal ideation. The goal isn't to intellectually solve people's problems, but to offer a different, uplifting energy.

### **Practical Challenges Addressed**
*   **Feeling Awkward or Forced:** This happens when you try to "deliver a gift you don't have." First, cultivate your own inner joy; then sharing it becomes natural.
*   **Dealing with Deep Distress (e.g., suicide talk):** Even here, the approach is to not join the despair. Skillful means might include using direct, shocking humor to break the thought pattern (e.g., "If you're going to do it, I want to watch") or firmly redirecting focus to life and joy. The aim is to challenge the delusion, not coddle it.
*   **Practicing in Seclusion vs. Community:** Seclusion is good for working with your own mind's complaints. Community (Sangha) is where you practice the advanced skill of maintaining joy amidst the negativity of others, which is where real growth happens.

### **Conclusion**
The talk reframes a challenging social situation as a **prime opportunity for Dhamma practice.** The path is to:
1.  **Remember** you have a choice.
2.  **Cultivate** and protect your own joyful mind.
3.  **Engage** from that joy, using humor, questions, and unwavering kindness to invite others toward a more wholesome state—without the need to fix, control, or criticize them.

The ultimate message is: **"Your job is to stay in a really good space... and then you can share your joy with them."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the central theme of dealing with negativity (like complaining) and cultivating a joyful, non-reactive mind. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **"Jumping off the boat" / "Catching a bullet" / "Joining the pity party":** These are used to describe the unskillful reaction of getting drawn into other people's negativity. When someone is suffering or complaining (like someone who has fallen overboard and is drowning), the unwise reaction is to jump in with them (commiserate, complain about their complaining). The skilled response is to stay on the boat (maintain your own joyful, stable perspective) and help from there.
2.  **"Snake nest":** The meditation class or group where people are complaining is humorously called a "snake nest," emphasizing the potential for getting "bitten" by negativity if you aren't careful and skillful.
3.  **"Riding the horse":** Unwholesome thoughts (like complaining) are compared to a horse that wants to throw you. The practice is to keep getting back on, resisting the urge to succumb, and eventually learning to ride it skillfully.
4.  **"The gift you don't have":** When you try to force a wholesome response but it feels unnatural, it's because you're trying to give someone a "gift" (e.g., genuine joy or peace) that you haven't fully cultivated for yourself yet. The advice is to give the gift you *do* have (your current state, perhaps honest curiosity or a simple smile).
5.  **"Fire hose of joy":** To counteract strong negativity (like deep grief or suicidal thoughts), you don't use a small "syringe" of joy, but rather overwhelm the situation with a "fire hose" of joy, celebration, and lightheartedness.
6.  **"Dust ourselves off":** The path is described as a practice where you will inevitably stumble. The key is not to complain about falling, but to simply "pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off" and start again.
7.  **"Teaching a pig to sing":** This is used to caution against trying to force the Dhamma on people who aren't ready or interested (like general society). It "frustrates the teacher and annoys the pig." The wise approach is to share with those already seeking (like people who come to a meditation class).

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The student and the book quote:** A student finds a profound line in a book and wants to share it with his father. The speaker cautions that the line had impact for the student because of his repeated prior exposure to the idea. For someone hearing it for the first time, it won't have the same power. This story illustrates the **need for repetition** in practice (comparing it to mindful breathing done over and over) and that you can't expect people to "get it" immediately.
2.  **The psychologist with the gun:** To confront a suicidal client, a psychologist hands them a real gun and says, "I want to watch." The story is used to illustrate a direct, shocking intervention that exposes the delusion and often performative aspect of suicidal threats, jolting the person out of their thought pattern. It underscores the point that sometimes the most compassionate response is not commiseration but a direct challenge to the negativity.
3.  **Associating with different groups:** The speaker uses the analogy of wanting to improve at chess by joining a chess club to explain the importance of **Sangha (spiritual community)**. If you hang out in a bar, you're more likely to become an alcoholic; if you hang out with practitioners, their "goodness may rub off." This story emphasizes that our environment and companions shape our habits.

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery:**
*   **Spatial Metaphors:** "Above it all," "aloof," "supramundane," "stay in a good space" vs. "cesspool," "pity party." These create a contrast between a higher, joyful perspective and the low, mired state of complaint.
*   **War/Battle Metaphors:** "Arrows and slings of outrageous fortune," "target," "bullets." These describe the critical words of others, which only hurt us if we "stand in the way" and choose to be a target.
*   **Path/Journey Metaphors:** The "Bonobo path" (likely a playful misspeak for "Bodhisattva" or simply the spiritual path), "get off the path," "uphill climb." These frame the practice as an ongoing journey with challenges.

The core message woven through all these metaphors and stories is: **You have a choice to not be pulled into the world's complaints. By cultivating and fiercely protecting your own inner joy through repeated practice, you can become a stable, uplifting presence that invites others out of their negativity without criticism or conflict.**
