### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Peter, it's been 6 months or so since you called. I'm really glad to see you again. Yeah, thanks. I really enjoy, in fact, touching base with the students who have really begun to understand, and then they don't call because there's no reason to. You're so darn happy. So I'm glad to see you all occasionally, and sure, I'm up for Dharma questions. So what you got?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in the suttas, the Buddha says that one should develop Sati based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing and release. And how should you practice seclusion, dispassion, and cessation?

**Speaker A:** All right. Um, first off, where did you read that?

**Speaker B:** I think it was in the Boyanga Samyutta number 2.

**Speaker A:** In the what sutta?

**Speaker B:** Boyanga.

**Speaker A:** You know

**Speaker B:** a sutta? Oh, uh, in the Samyutta Nikaya number 46. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's in the 46s. Okay, all right. Um, Let's look at Sati from the point of seclusion first. Okay. And from seclusion first, we could say that the beginner who is practicing is dealing with the world the way that he is dealing with the world, because that's the habit that he has had, and that the world then distracts him. And so it's better to get away from it all so that we can practice. And what we're actually practicing is to remember to be here now. And when things are always inviting you to look into the past and look into the future, there are billboards, advertisements, and makeup artists and all kinds of things that are happening that try to distract us from what's going on in the present moment. And so it's hard to develop Sati when we're in a really noisy environment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And you could say that that's also true by learning to swim in a raging river. It's actually hard to learn to swim when you're in a raging river. In great turmoil, in the great rush. It's better to learn in a still pond. Yeah. Okay, so in that regard, we're talking about the beginning is that we need to get ourselves away from it all. That the Buddha actually has a very famous analogy like that, the Saddha Sutta number 36 in the Mahayana Anicca about seclusion. Is by talking about that a fire maker cannot come. In the time of the Buddha, they had professional fire makers, but now fires are so easy to start because everybody knows how to do it. We've got Swayamuntra electric and also phosphorus at the end of a stick and all kinds of things that we can use nowadays. In the time of the Buddha, Making a fire from scratch is difficult and it requires know-how, and so there were professional firemakers. So that's the setting for the firemaker. And that the idea is that can this firemaker set a log on fire that is immersed in a swamp? This is the story I call the Log in the Bog. Now, that means that when we are immersed in society, we are actually saturated and waterlogged with it. And that if we take that log out of the swamp and put it up on the land, it's still completely saturated, but after a while it will begin to dry out. And when it's dry on the top just a little bit, now the fire maker can begin to get something going with it. That in fact, this is the way that dugout canoes are done. Is that you get a swampy log and then as it starts to dry out, you begin to burn it in the middle and chop it out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So if we look at Sati like that, that's the number one reason why we do want to get into seclusion is so we can develop the Sati of remembering to keep coming back to the present moment. No matter what distractions there are. Okay, so that's the first aspect of it, is that we have to practice Sati in seclusion, and then when we get better at it, then we can, let us say, have a skill developed so that we can remember when things begin to happen when we return to the world. And so everybody's question has to do with What's the ratio then? How long should I stay on dry land to dry out versus can I come in and out and in and out and in and out and spend just a few minutes on the out of the water and get just a little bit of a fire going and then get right back into it, which would be the way that people are often living. And then you have the other extreme of both in Thailand and in Tibet, but Tibet is famous for it, is that they will take an a monk when he is ready for it and put him into seclusion for 3 years so that the only contact he has with the outside world is a plate of food that slides under the door once a day. And other than that, he's on his own out there. Now, generally what they have is these are in caves that are dug out of the side of a hill, which means that while he's looking out, He's got quite a nice vista, he's got quite a here-now to deal with. So how long in seclusion do you need to be is the question, and the answer to that is, it depends upon the Sati, that that's what it's all about. That will be your criteria, is that when you're in seclusion, are you developing Sati? And when you come out of seclusion, can you practice that which you've been— or actually, can you perform that which you've been practicing? And that is the practice of Sati is actually the practice of remembering to be here now. Wake up, like we say, to wake up and to smell the coffee. Well, to smell the coffee, that's an in-breath, and it's going into sensory awareness. To wake up and come into sensory awareness, into the here and now, as opposed to in that sixth sense door, which is the mind. But the mind has got input from the past and the future, to where all of the other senses have input from this present moment. And Sati is developing the remembrance over and over again to come back into the present moment. Why? Because only then can we investigate this present moment. When the mind is stuck in the past, you can't investigate the past,

**Speaker B:** but

**Speaker A:** we're stuck in it instead. We don't even know that because there's no Sati, and so we're asleep in the past, dreaming. In fact, this is what we mean by daydreaming. When the child is called down and from the teacher says, you know, pay attention, Stop daydreaming. And the kids just, you know, he's not thinking about what's in class at all. He's all in his own world. And what the teachings of the Buddha is about is let's get out of the classroom and practice being in the here and now rather than having to do practice of it while we're with the teacher. Just be good at paying attention before we have to pay attention to the teacher. Okay, so that's another way of looking at it, is that Sati means the ability to pay attention to what's happening in this present moment. All right, so that's the conclusion part. What was the second one on your list?

**Speaker B:** And dispassion, then he says dispassion.

**Speaker A:** All right, so here we are in our bog, and that the that passion is all the juicy stuff, okay? And so we live in a world, we live in a bog that's full of juicy stuff, and people are always interested in the juicy parts, okay? The passion. And so, uh, that's what we get from a lot of people. But as we're developing, uh, in seclusion We become dispassionate to all of the things that we wanted. And, you know, the greed, ill will, and delusion— we become dispassionate about that. But in the beginning, for the student, that's a process. And the process of becoming dispassionate is first off to get out of our not liking it. Here's the example of that is that Goenka says at the beginning of the meditation retreat, watch your breath, and when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. And none of the students can do that. They can't never mind, start again. When they recognize the mind has wandered away from the breath, they want to really take an opportunity to beat themselves up mentally. 'Oh, you're supposed to be watching your breath. How dare you screw up again?' And we are very critical of ourselves. And so this is part of that work in the seclusion, is to know the difference with Sati and with investigation of what's wholesome and what's not wholesome. And being critical upon ourselves about we're not doing the meditation correctly. Is in fact the very, very best opportunity we have of insight, when we understand that the practice of meditation is nothing but the practice of relaxing and letting everything be okay. So when the students are saying, "Oh, what can I do about my meditation?" that means that they're actually in that moment practicing dissatisfaction, when they think they're practicing satisfaction. Okay, yeah, satisfaction is okay. I don't care where it came from and I don't care where it's going. I've got no doubt about it that it's okay right now. That's the satisfaction. And so this is what we need to practice, which is another way of saying practicing wholesome thought. So we're actually combining now Sati with the rest of the Eightfold Noble Path, that we can say in fact that one of the things that the old masters will do is that when they pick up one string, that in fact you're picking up the whole thing. It's sort of like a suitcase with a handle. We don't have to pick up and hold a suitcase this way, we just got a handle for it. And so this word Sati is now the handle for the whole Eightfold Noble Path. Once you pick up Sati, that means now we have to investigate. Yeah, what we're going to investigate is all of this passion, for one thing. Okay, and as we investigate that passion, we begin to recognize I have some control over that passion. Okay, and so I can change some massage it and change it to the way that I want to. And in that regard, this is where we go into now seeing the more positive parts of the passion, which would be the Sukkha, which is the satisfaction, and the Piti, which is the "Wow, I could do this. Oh, this is so good" kind of feeling.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So as we continue to practice, that begins to relax also. Even that acceleration of, wow, this is so nice, is a lot of work in a way. And we could just, oh yeah, it's so nice, I know, I've seen how nice it is, and well, I like it, I don't have to get so excited about it anymore. And now that's when that dispassion is coming into play, which means you can handle things and Again, at this level, we need to practice that in seclusion, because most of the people out there are dealing with the world in their passion. And if we can begin to deal with the mind as it is, without so much passion about it, and in fact, a better way of stating it, rather than— and you can say that the word dispassion in English, that word is an almost harsh word. Yeah, it has almost the quality of, "I don't give a flying rip about you." Okay, which is actually, in a word, dispassion is almost a kind of slight hostile reaction. And we're not looking for a kind of little bit harsh reaction. That real dispassion is actually, "Oh, well, come on in. Never mind." Or a more friendly way of inviting it in. So, dispassion needs to have that friendly quality to it rather than an aversion quality to the dispassion. That in fact, That's actually quite normal for Westerners. When they hear the word dispassion, they automatically have that aversion kind of quality to it, that I'm not supposed to have passion about that.

**Speaker B:** I was exactly coming along that issue because I was thinking the exact same way, that the Buddhist teachings in general are very friendly. And here, these English terms seem to be very harsh, like you say.

**Speaker A:** Right, so they're using harsh English language to try to describe something that's in the Pali quite gushy, quite warm, fuzzy, and soft. It's almost interesting. In fact, it's a very, very humorous joke. I like this joke very much when people talk about hardcore Buddhism, right? It's actually quite a big thing on the internet. And the deeper core of the teaching of Buddha, guess what? The core of Buddhism is not a nut or a hard core, it's a gushy pastry filling. It's a jelly donut. Not a donut with a real nut in the center, not a nut, it's not that kind of discussion. Squishy, delicious. Yeah, there's not much to it. This is what we mean, because the passion is having to chew on it. Yeah, and there's nothing to chew on. There's really just the delight of the deliciousness of it. So this is a way also of looking at that quality of dispassion. Or, um, there's a lot of Pali words that, that have that are dancing around that quality. One of them is the word Upekkha. I was actually wondering, do you know what Pali word that they were referring to using the word dispassion?

**Speaker B:** It's

**Speaker A:** Vosaga.

**Speaker B:** Is it Vivekkha, Vosaga?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I think it's Vosaga.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, I know other words that are very close to that, but in other words, I get it. One of the words that I like is the one that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa likes so much, and that's 'atam mayeta.' And the secret to it is that 'ta' at the end. You've heard me talk about this, is that 'tam' is the Pali word for doing, and 'atam' is not doing. And so it's not doing maya, not making a mess. Aha! And the 'ta' is an expletive at the end of it. 'Atam mayeta.' I'm just not going to do it anymore. Okay, so that's a way of working up the dispassion. Yeah. Okay, is, uh, kind of a throwing it back or relinquishing it or getting rid of it, throwing it out like that. But we're not doing that with this, with distaste or hatred or aversion. Yeah, we're doing it with loving kindness in a way.

**Speaker B:** Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see you, Mara. Yeah, it's the way that we say it. And so we can become friends with, um, all of the stuff in one's mind that we would normally say I would prefer to get rid of. It's better to give it a kiss goodbye than a boot. Okay. So this is the way of the dispassion, is learning to say goodbye with a hug and a kiss and a fine goodwill rather than a rejection.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So I also thought that if you try to put it into practice, and I also was considering doing it in a friendly way. Then I thought that you always told me to relax or make the mind wholesome, and I think maybe to have a relaxed step of calming the mind in terms of calming thoughts and calming the body in terms of relaxing the body. Maybe would you say that this would be a practical approach to practice this seclusion, this passion, that you more relax or calm the mind, based that you practice Sati and based upon calming the mind. Can you say that?

**Speaker A:** And right, and but we do that with, let us call it, in the sense of a full cycle. There's one of the things that's very interesting about, uh, uh, electricity with, with waves And it's not very important until we recognize that in fact it is easier to roll to nothing from the top of the hill down rather than climbing up from the bottom. Okay. And so what we mean by that is that it's very difficult to get to a state of equanimity or dispassion from unhappiness and passion, that the right way to go is to first of all begin to control the mind, so that you now have some power over whether you're going to feel good or feel bad. That we don't just feel bad and then learn to somehow stop feeling. That's almost the same thing as just having, uh, nothing but negative or unwholesome thoughts, and then you go to no mind and you stop having thoughts altogether. That's not the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha. No, you have to go into wholesome first so that you have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought, and then you can put some gaps in the middle. Yeah, also that's where we talk about the Jhanas in the sense that we actually, with the first Jhana We talk ourselves into feeling just as absolutely good as we can possibly feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we let that kind of slide away into more satisfaction and comfort, down into a very kind of even-keeled dispassion that was based upon a downhill coaster ride rather than an uphill climb.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is so funny that you say that because the second question I wanted to ask you was that in the beginning there was much verbalization in my mind, like you say, talking the mind into wholesome states. And by the time verbalization like seemed a little bit like a distraction because if since the mind was wholesome, it was more easy to dwell in that wholesome state rather than verbalize. Would you say that is correct?

**Speaker A:** Yes, because you're spending more mind moments experiencing how nice you feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Fewer mind moments talking yourself into how nice you feel. Yeah. So you talk yourself into it, and as you talk yourself into it, you begin to see, wow, that's really nice. And then we even stop with the grind and just pay attention to how nice it is. That's the difference through the second Jhana, right there, is we start talking ourselves into how nice it is and start to experience how nice it is. And then we get really elated and really excited about, wow, this is too much, it's so good, I can't understand it. But then we begin to recognize even that's a lot of work. Yeah, feeling that good is a lot of work. Let me feel really good without so much work.

**Speaker B:** So, mind, this is Vitaka, or,

**Speaker A:** uh, yes, so, um, that's the, the kind of dispassion that we're looking for, is the dispassion that comes from very, very high quality good feelings that are promoted through acts of generosity and gratitude and friendliness and compassion and all of that stuff, especially the Mudita of sharing our joy. So we share our joy and then everyone feels that state of satisfaction. Everybody then moves into the state of Upekkha, which is the state of satisfaction, which is then in English translated into dispassion. Dispassion is actually a form of dukkha, the way that we use the word dispassion, that we're looking for in fact a dispassion that is quite satisfied. And so that's the danger of that kind of language, is that we miss— we can actually get confused about how to practice because we're looking for that kind of dissatisfied disinterest. Okay, so we want to kind of kick it out rather than kiss it goodbye. Yeah. All right, so what's then the next line, or what's the next word in that sequence?

**Speaker B:** And then there's the last one, would be cessation.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's the whole point of the satisfaction, is when we're completely satisfied, then there's no more struggle. The struggle itself ceases. We're satisfied. No place to go and nothing to do is that state of satisfaction, which is everything has come to a halt. No place to go, nothing to do. But in English, we hear the word cessation differently than the way that it's actually meant in the Pali. And so we again take on a hard edge to it. Okay, well, for them, sensation is almost like that you beat it to death.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Instead of laying it to rest, which is completely different concept.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so we just let everything just fall apart, just take a rest, and that means the cessation of all of the activity that is the activity of passion. And so the Eightfold Noble Path, and most specifically Sati, is right there, but it's not enough just by itself of waking up, because that would be the way that you could think of as the Mahasi method of waking up and taking a look at the garbage without actually taking the garbage out. So now we're trying to be dispassionate with a whole bunch of garbage in the room. We've been taking the garbage out, being completely satisfied that the garbage is out, and now there's cessation, but we're also full of emptiness because things have been cleaned and all the garbage has been taken out, so there's nothing much left.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** OK, so I think— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think you made a very important point. Looking for that, this dispassion, seclusion, dispassion, cessation, that it's something wholesome you develop. And I really feel that I got the key point, that it's nothing harsh or something you have to kick out of the mind, but it's more like to develop wholesome qualities, like the friendly aspect of the practice, right?

**Speaker A:** The friendliness aspect of it. If people get that friendliness and only use it to look at the harsh words that have somehow been translated. So I don't know what was happening with the mind of the translator when he would choose those kinds of words in English, that we need to pay much closer attention to the words used because they have those slight little connotations. The words, there's nothing wrong with that word in and of itself, but it's the coloration that it has. It's not a bright, shiny dispassion, it's a dull, foreboding kind of dispassion. Yeah, it's like almost an angry 'I don't give a rip.'

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that is a problem for acting the teaching out, because I think the teaching, like you say, should always be developing wholesome Dhammas.

**Speaker A:** Oh, here's an example of that. This is an old example. Okay, let us say it's in a rest home, or maybe it's just in the bedroom where Grandma is infirm and it's very difficult for her to move around, and so she poops on herself in the bed. Now Mom comes in and sees Granny pooped in the bed, and she doesn't like it at all. She's got a whole lot of passion about it, okay? And she doesn't want to clean it up. Now, little Johnny is much more interested in what's going on, and so he's curious. But right there with them is their dog, and the dog actually finds something delicious. Now, the interesting thing would be to just go ahead and let the dog clean up the mess. Why won't Mom let the dog clean up the mess? Little Bully standing there will think that's a hilarious thing to do, but Mom is full of passion about Granny can't take care of herself and look what a mess she's made and I have to clean it up. Yeah, right. But now we can see with 3 people there, we've actually got our 3 animals or beings there You can see three different attitudes: one really hates it, one is really curious, and one is dispassionate about all of that stuff and is just finding a nice meal to have. Why is that? It's because he's kind of dispassionate about it. So in that regard, both the boy and the dog could be seen as somewhat dispassionate, but the real problem is the passion of the mom. So she doesn't like what's going on and she thinks that she's the boss and has to clean it up, and then she won't let the dog do it. Well, I don't, I don't understand that. I think every rest home should have a dog for just that purpose. Great. But so that's another way of looking at that issue of passion, is that we have to get completely out of our aversion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the only way to do that is to become friends with it. Yeah, so we become friends with our misdeeds and wrongdoing, because if we don't like our misdeeds and wrongdoing, we'll feel regret and remorse and whatnot like that, but then we'll lie to ourselves and to others about it. Oh, I'm okay, I didn't do that. All right, yeah, but if we're quite willing to look at what we've done wrong in a, in this case, dispassionate or friendly way, let me really look at what I'm doing because then I can see and learn and come out of it. But so long as I don't want to see it, so long as I have passion about it, I'll be stuck with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So, Bhante, I really feel that you answered my question, and unfortunately I have to go to work right now, so we have to come to an end.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so this is really great. Don't wait so long. I really like to see you on the Sangha groups. I think that others would get great joy out of meeting you, and I'm really proud of you. I really congratulate you for your practice. It shows. You cut your mic off. I don't hear you. Yeah, do that, turn it on again. No, I don't hear you. Okay, all right, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a student (Speaker B):

### **Core Topic:** How to practice mindfulness (*sati*) based on **seclusion, dispassion, and cessation**, as mentioned in the suttas.

---

### **1. Seclusion (*Viveka*)**
*   **Purpose:** To create a conducive environment for developing *sati* (remembering to be present). Just as it's hard to learn to swim in a raging river, it's hard to develop mindfulness in a distracting, "noisy" world.
*   **The Analogy of the "Log in the Bog":** A log soaked in a swamp (the mind saturated with worldly concerns) cannot catch fire. Only when removed and allowed to dry (seclusion) can a firemaker (the meditator) ignite it (develop concentration and insight).
*   **Practical Application:** Seclusion allows one to practice "coming back to the present moment" without constant external pulls. The required duration of seclusion depends on the individual's development of *sati*. The skill is to then bring that mindful presence back into daily life.

### **2. Dispassion (*Virāga*)**
*   **Key Insight:** The English term "dispassion" can sound harsh and aversive, but the Pali concept is **friendly, warm, and gentle**. It is not a cold rejection, but a **relaxed, wholesome letting go**.
*   **The Process:** Dispassion is cultivated **through satisfaction, not through suppression**.
    1.  First, one learns to cultivate **wholesome mental states** (e.g., gratitude, friendliness, joy) through positive mental guidance (*vitakka*).
    2.  From the "high ground" of these good feelings, one can gently relax into dispassion. It's a "downhill coaster ride" from happiness to peaceful equanimity, not an uphill battle against negativity.
*   **Practical Application:** It's about **"kissing goodbye" with kindness** rather than "kicking out" with aversion. This friendly dispassion allows us to look at our own flaws and unwholesome patterns without guilt or denial, enabling real learning and release.

### **3. Cessation (*Nirodha*)**
*   **The Result:** Cessation is the natural outcome of deep satisfaction (*sukkha*). When the mind is fully content, struggle and frantic activity **cease on their own**. There is "no place to go and nothing to do."
*   **Clarification:** Like "dispassion," "cessation" in this context is **not a violent stopping**. It is a peaceful **coming to rest**, like laying something down rather than beating it to death. It is the cessation of the *activity of passion*.
*   **The Role of *Sati*:** Mindfulness is the handle to this entire process, but it must be coupled with the rest of the Noble Eightfold Path to not just see "the garbage" (unwholesome states) but to actually **clean it out** through cultivating wholesomeness, leading to a peaceful, "empty" cessation.

---

### **Overall Theme & Warning**
The talk repeatedly warns against misinterpreting these path factors through the lens of harsh English translations. The true Dhamma path is **friendly and wholesome**. The core practice is:
1.  **Withdraw** to develop the skill of presence (seclusion).
2.  Cultivate **wholesome joy and satisfaction**.
3.  Gently **relax into dispassionate equanimity** from that place of fullness.
4.  Allow activity to **cease naturally** in peace.

The path is likened to a **"jelly donut"**—its core is soft, sweet, and satisfying, not a hard, harsh nut. The fundamental attitude for practicing seclusion, dispassion, and cessation should be one of **kindness and friendliness** towards oneself and one's experience.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the Buddhist concepts of seclusion, dispassion, and cessation. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors for Seclusion & Developing Mindfulness (Sati)**

*   **Learning to Swim:**  
    > "You could say that... it's like learning to swim in a raging river. It's actually hard to learn to swim when you're in a raging river... It's better to learn in a still pond."  
    *   **Meaning:** A noisy, distracting world (the raging river) makes it hard to develop mindfulness. Seclusion provides a calm, controlled environment (the still pond) for practice.

*   **The Log in the Bog (A story from the suttas):**  
    This is the central story for explaining seclusion.
    *   **The Metaphor:** A person immersed in society is like a waterlogged log in a swamp. A firemaker (the meditator) cannot ignite it (develop concentration/insight) while it's soaked.
    *   **The Process:** You must first take the log out of the swamp (go into seclusion). It will slowly dry out (the mind calms and detaches from worldly saturation). Only when it's dry can a fire be started (mindfulness and insight can ignite).
    *   **The Application:** This illustrates the *need* for seclusion and answers the practical question of "how long?"—you stay in seclusion until the "log" of your mind is dry enough to "catch fire."

*   **The Classroom Daydreamer:**  
    > "When the child is called down by the teacher... 'Stop daydreaming.'... what the teachings of the Buddha is about is let's get out of the classroom and practice being in the here and now."  
    *   **Meaning:** Normal life is like being forced to pay attention in class while prone to distraction. Meditation practice is like training the "muscle" of attention (*sati*) outside of class, so you can be present when you need to be.

---

### **2. Metaphors for Dispassion & Wholesome Development**

*   **The Jelly Donut (vs. the Hard Nut):**  
    > "The core of Buddhism is not a nut or a hard core, it's a gushy pastry filling. It's a jelly donut... Squishy, delicious... the passion is having to chew on it. Yeah, and there's nothing to chew on."  
    *   **Meaning:** This counters the harsh, austere image of dispassion. True dispassion is not a hard, rejecting state but a soft, satisfying, and delightful one—like the sweet center of a donut, not a tough nut to crack.

*   **The Suitcase Handle:**  
    > "It's sort of like a suitcase with a handle... this word *Sati* is now the handle for the whole Eightfold Noble Path. Once you pick up *Sati*, that means now we have to investigate."  
    *   **Meaning:** Mindfulness isn't practiced in isolation. Cultivating it naturally engages and lifts all other aspects of the path (investigation, ethics, concentration, etc.).

*   **Rolling Downhill vs. Climbing Uphill:**  
    > "It is easier to roll to nothing from the top of the hill down rather than climbing up from the bottom."  
    *   **Meaning:** You don't achieve dispassion/equanimity by starting from misery and trying to force stillness. You first cultivate wholesome, joyful states (climb to the top of the hill via generosity, kindness, etc.), and then you naturally relax into a serene dispassion (a gentle roll downhill).

*   **Kiss Goodbye vs. Boot Out:**  
    > "It's better to give it a kiss goodbye than a boot."  
    *   **Meaning:** Dispassion (*vossagga*) is not about harsh rejection or aversion to negative states. It's a friendly, gentle letting go—a release with goodwill, not a fight.

### **3. Metaphors for Cessation & the End Goal**

*   **Taking Out the Garbage (Mahasi Method Critique):**  
    > "The Mahasi method of waking up and taking a look at the garbage without actually taking the garbage out... We've been taking the garbage out... and now there's cessation, but we're also full of emptiness because things have been cleaned."  
    *   **Meaning:** Cessation isn't just seeing defilements (garbage) with bare attention. It's the satisfying result of a complete cleansing—the peaceful, empty state *after* the garbage (passion, aversion) has been fully removed.

*   **Grandma, the Boy, and the Dog (A story about attitudes):**  
    This story contrasts reactions to an unpleasant situation (an infirm grandmother soiling the bed).
    *   **The Mother:** Represents **passion/aversion**—she is upset, resistant, and sees only a burdensome problem.
    *   **The Boy:** Represents **curiosity/investigation**—a more neutral, observing mind.
    *   **The Dog:** Represents **dispassion**—it has no emotional story or aversion; it simply relates to the situation based on its nature (a potential meal).
    *   **Meaning:** True dispassion allows us to see reality without the distorting filter of our likes and dislikes. The problem isn't the situation itself, but the "passion of the mom"—our added layer of aversion. Freedom comes from being "friends with" reality, even its unpleasant parts.

### **Overall Theme of the Metaphors:**
The speaker consistently uses metaphors to **soften perceived harshness in Buddhist translations** (like "seclusion," "dispassion," "cessation"). He reframes them as natural, friendly, and positive processes:
*   **Seclusion** is a supportive training ground, not an escape.
*   **Dispassion** is a sweet, satisfying relaxation, not a cold rejection.
*   **Cessation** is a peaceful fullness from cleansing, not a nihilistic nothingness.

The stories make the abstract teachings relatable and emphasize a joyful, wholesome path to awakening.
