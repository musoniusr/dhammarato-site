### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Does it show yet? Yeah. Yes. Okay, so guys, this is Saturday morning here in Thailand and it is raining. It's not raining hard, but it's a steady downpour, um, a bit cool. And that, uh, Pedro has asked a question that, um I'd like to discuss. And the way that he phrased the question was that the way that I teach is different than the way that Ajahn Samadhi teaches in a particular way, and that this actually has a lot to do with the structure and the way things were set up at what Anapanasati, in the sense of Samatha said, don't worry about the mind, that what you have to pay attention to is your actions and your speech. Now, what that would mean would be Sila, that you get your morality straightened out first. And that this is one of the ways of training the monks in the sense of the young man comes into the Wat and he ordains, and then he has to start behaving and speaking the way that the monks behave and speak. And that Pedro is confused because I talk in a different way. And so I would like— in that regard that the mind is all we have to deal with. Now the first thing to say about that is that the mind is the forerunner. If you're going to behave or if you're going to speak in a moral or structured way, you have to remember to do that with your mind. The mind is the forerunner. So if we're— can you turn your microphone off, Kat? It's got an echo. This gives rise to the fact that there are really two different methods of teaching the Dharma, or you could also say there are two levels of Dharma. One is the ordinary level or the beginner's level, and then the other is the supramundane. And that what Ajahn Samatha is doing is absolutely correct in a particular context, and that in many other situations I would teach that also. But Ajahn Po has given me the injunction of teach from the supramundane, the Noble Dharma, not the beginner's Dharma. And the reason for that obviously is that in Western Buddhism, the way that it's set up and structured, people are going to stay at that ordinary level of Dhamma and to never get introduced to the Noble Dharma. And we're actually talking about the Eightfold Noble Path. Now in Sutta 46, Dhammadina talks to her— let us use the word ex-husband, not really an ex-husband because ex-husbands don't go to nun wives to learn Dharma, if you think of it the way that you normally think of an ex-husband. That he was her husband and still was her husband, and if she disrobed, he would then be her husband again. But in this sutta, she talks about the Eightfold Noble Path in three divisions of Sila, Samatha, Pañña. And so she was introducing her husband to the ordinary Dharma. Where Sila comes first. And we teach children that way in Thailand. We give the children the precepts. We give them ceremonies where the Triple Gem, taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and all of that. Except that you'll find also in Suttas, especially in the Samyutta Nikaya, there's a whole section, one of 52 sections, on the Srotapanna. And in there they mentioned that the Srotapanna is the one who can keep the precepts and does take refuge in the Buddha in a really profound way. And so Buddhism is introduced in the sense of this is kind of your goal and your goal is kind of the starting point. Because once you get to the real starting point, you kind of give up on goals. So the ordinary beginner's Dharma has a goal to it, but after we reach that goal, we become more or less goalless. Less. So the ordinary Dharma starts with Sila. Can you learn to change your behavior? Because in order to change your behavior, you're already changing the mind. And that in Sutta number 24, it points out that the Sila needs to be pure in order for you to practice Samadhi, so that you can make that pure so that you can get your view pure. Well, here we're starting already with a pure view. So in that pure view, we don't see time frames, but we see things in the immediate moment. But when we talk about Sila, Samatha, and Pañña in the ordinary sense, that means that the young man goes to the wat, he ordains, or in the case of the kids, the kids have to behave themselves while they're at school or while they're at home. And that's over a time period. And so in one context, Sila is time-oriented. Are you going to be mindful right now to behave yourself? And then over time, regain that organization of mind, and then the view, which is actually Pañña. So it starts Sila, Samatha, Pañña, but then at the supermundane level, it changes from the Eightfold Path into the Eightfold Noble Path, which starts with Pañña, goes into real organization of mind, and the outcome then of that your mind is in fact Sila. So one starts with Sila, the ordinary starts with Sila in the sense of learning to behave, and that already has an element of the mind built into it. But at the higher level, once the mind is actually quite pure and organized, then you don't want anything. And if you don't want anything, you're unlikely to kill somebody to get it. Yes. Okay, so there are actually two levels. There are two Eightfold Paths. One is for the ordinary and one is noble. And Ajahn Sumedho is quite, uh, correctly teaching at the level that he does, of starting with Sila. And so that was the way that Ajahn Chah set up Wat Pannanachat. And that was the way then that Amaravati is also organized, but not nearly in the strict way that it used to be. That they've added a quality of nobility to it. So, this is the way that we have to look at things in starting with children. We have to teach them to behave, and the reason that we would have to teach them to behave by using carrot and stick, or punishments and rewards, is because they're not wise enough to see The real issue is not punishment and rewards, it's wisdom. That our wisdom then, or our mind, is able to see Dukkha. And if you can see Dukkha and avoid it, then your Sila is going to be perfect. It's going to be pure. The example that I use sometimes is imagine They do this in both Islam and the Jewish, where they have both kosher and halal. That has to do not with just the way the food is cooked, but also the way the animal is killed. And it has to be done in a ceremony. That in fact, that's what they were doing in the temple in the time of Jesus, selling birds and selling goats and all of that stuff that could be slaughtered on the altar. So nowadays, imagine that you've got a village somewhere in Israel or in the Middle East or someplace like that, and the mullah or the rabbi, it's his job to do the slaughtering. And somebody brings a goat that he's got to ritualize in a way, slaughter. But on this particular day, he's been doing some good praying, or he's in a good mood, or something like that, and he goes out there with his knife to perform his ceremony, the slaughter of the animal, and he looks in the animal's eyes and he can't do it because his mind had become pure at that moment. He couldn't kill it. Now, if that actually took in a big way, he would actually set down that knife and not do that job anymore. But at least in this time, he looks in that animal's eyes and says, I can't do this. Now, that's the purity of mind that we're talking about. But, uh, he does not have the Sila in the sense of a precept or a law or a rule or a judgment. Thou shalt not kill, but rather his law or rule or judgment is thou shalt kill if you do it in a ceremony, in a proper ceremony. All right, and that this is actually an issue that I remember when I was in high school, that all of the churches in the town that I was living in at the time, because of Vietnam War How about this commandment, thou shalt not kill? And how about this army and the draft? And how do we reconcile that? Because the kids were actually wise enough and smart enough to see that the church was teaching a duality. It's not okay to kill because you don't like it, but it's okay for you to kill somebody because you're told to kill them. By somebody else who doesn't like them. And so it's a matter then of the rules. The rules get bent, changed, and modified over time, but in reality, wisdom is always the same— Dukkha or Dukkha-Nirodha. And so this is the transition that we have to make from the ordinary life of starting with Sila, starting with being told what to do and getting our act together, getting our speech together. But really, in order to do that, we're changing the mind. The mind is the forerunner. We cannot stop our bad behavior if we do not think or see that this is not a good idea to do this. Because it's breaking the rule or it's dangerous or something like that. Now, to be honest with you, when I was a kid, I was a shoplifter. The first time I got caught at it was when I was 6 years old. And what happened was is that there was, um, uh, uh, in this store that was actually a, a rundown used kind of stuff. They sold merchandise that nobody else wanted. And in there, for a nickel, was a wide variety— hello, God— uh, there was a wide variety of calligraphy pen points. And as a 6-year-old, I saw arrowheads. Hot dog, I've got arrowheads here! I'm going to take these to put it on the end of a stick and I've got arrows. And so I took some, and my mom found out and she told me to— in fact, she took me back to the store to return them. But that didn't stop me from shoplifting. And I did get caught when I was about 13 or so in the store taking a bunch of stuff. Because it was a small town, they didn't have to do anything for me. In fact, I saw that she saw what I was doing. But then, then that night, my dad knows about it because she told the police, and the police came to talk to my dad about it. But still there was no retribution. I still did not see the Dukkha. And so I continued to shoplift. Until, um, actually it had to do with the mindset that I was in. Because years later I had the opportunity to— where for many, many years, because I was in Asia, there's very little shoplifting in Asia. Why? Because the store clerk is going to walk around the store with you and other things like this. Plus also being a monk there was no option that monks don't go out shopping or shoplifting. But the thought did occur to me one time is when I was in with another group of monks in Walmart, and the thought occurred to me it would be a tragedy to shoplift as a monk and get caught at it. But then is when the Dukkha— I began to see the Dukkha, how dangerous it was. And since that time, I have not chocolate them, not once, because I could see finally the danger in it. And that's the problem in our education, all of the shalt-nots. Don't have the wisdom built into it to teach the children how dangerous it is to do some of our behaviors. And so what we normally do instead is kind of put the children in a sort of moral straitjacket, almost like a body cast. And that would be the way that you would think of it is for Western men, young men, to come to become a monk is that that robe becomes a body cast. An example of that is the way that the robe is built when— well, not the way the robe is built, the way it's worn. When we're in the wat, it's kind of loosey-goosey. You don't have to put— I mean, you can just throw the robe this way and throw it that way if you're wearing the robe, or you don't wear the robe at all. Um, so when— hello, God. So when we are dressed up to go out, the robe is around the neck, and the monks will take it and turn it like this into what they call an elephant's trunk. And then you wrap it around, and your left hand has to hold that elephant strong, that if you let go of it, it falls down, and then all the— it becomes unraveled. You literally have to hold your hand in such a way to stop becoming disrobed. And then the other one that Ajahn Toh gave me was to always wear the arm bag on the left arm because that was the arm that already held the end of the rope. And so he put other restrictions on me that way in the sense of behavior. Now, how am I going to behave as a monk? And on Vindhya Bhavana, in this time of year, in the rainy season, we had to manage an umbrella the umbrella, the arm bag, the elephant's trunk, the bowl, and the lid of the bowl. And you've only got two hands. So popping the umbrella and hooking it under the arm, but then you got to hold the arm in a certain way to keep the umbrella from falling. And then you've got to learn while you're holding that thing God's having a ball today. Hello, God. In fact, I even see the flash of lightning over in this direction, but the thunder seems to be coming from back there. So the point that I'm making was, was that I decided that, oh, I'm going to put a strap on that bowl to help me with it. And I had a little piece piece of orange string, and I took very carefully— it was a lot of work— but I put tiny little holes in the top of the metal bowl and then had this string put around it. And when I walked up to Ajahn Po, he already saw it. He saw it before I even got close to him, and it was intentionally designed to hide where most people wouldn't see it, but he saw it. And that was quite an education for me about pay attention to what's going on. Kat and I have talked about this quite a lot. In fact, what happened this morning was is that they started the truck up in the neighbor's yard over there, and I immediately mentioned the smell of the truck, and Kat hadn't noticed the smell until I mentioned it. And then, yes, that automobiles, they stink when you crank them up. But most people, we don't pay much attention to that kind of stuff. And so this is what Ajahn Chah was doing, was he was paying attention to me. He cared about me, and he loved me that much that he put me through hell with a robe, a bowl, a lid, a yam bag, and an umbrella that we had to manage while he took me out on gravel roads barefoot. And that was the training of Sila. But it really wasn't the training of Sila at all. It was still a mental training that I had to be watchful, I had to be mindful. It wasn't necessarily a physical physical training at all. It was a mindfulness training. But this is the way that we train young monks to start paying attention to what's going on in your surroundings, so that in fact the bhendabhat was a walking meditation to pay attention. So this is what we have to learn to do all our lives. Look how many tiny little rules that you have had to learn and put up with. Alex, even your English language has hundreds, if not thousands, of rules. And so we manipulate all of these rules in the mind that wind up being supposed to. And one of the main ones that we have is you're supposed to get it right. Okay. And so that means that you've got to behave yourself, you've got to get it right. But that mentality of you've got to get it right, while it helps with Sila, it actually interferes with the higher practice of Anapanasati. Because instead of being in the gear of you've got to get it right, you have to be in the gear of seeing that you've got a rule there that you've got to get it right, and you feel bad when you don't. And so the rule now becomes an interference. In the beginning it was training, but later it winds up being an interference. Ah, he's going to do it again. There it goes. I saw the flash of the lightning out of the corner of my mind's eye, so I knew that the thunder was going to happen again. Um, so this is the whole point about that training, is to get us up to a level to where we can really start paying attention, that Sila actually is very much like the beginning training of martial arts. You know, they've got the white belt and the yellow belt and the green belt and maybe a blue belt or something, and then a brown belt. And all of that training is to get the movements of the body, to get your actions right. But a real fight has to be with your eyes. You got to watch what's going on. If he throws a punch, you got to be be there in time to either block it or get out of its way.

**Speaker B:** Seems like, uh, seems like there's like a different training for, uh, for monks here because they kind of have to learn the Thai culture also, not just practicing Sila but actually practicing to fit in with the Thai culture. It's like another part of the training.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right. That's the Sila training, is to learn to fit into Thai culture. And that many, many Westerners will move into Thailand and never learn the Thai culture. That is the best way that I know of learning Thai culture is by becoming a monk and learning to fit in to the Thai culture. So actually the Thais have learned that culture of being a monk from childhood. It's part of the culture. And the Arhat took special care with me because I did not have that cultural built-in stuff. And so he put me through this wringer on Venerable every morning, managing the bowl and the robe and the umbrella and the pot. Luckily, we didn't have to carry the umbrella most of the year, but during the Ponzos time, that was an extruded action. And that's one thing— you don't drop your umbrella when it's raining. So that whole point then is that this training in Sila is to get us to pay attention to what we're doing with our behavior, but later the structure of the Sila becomes an interference with your practice. That's why it's actually in two stages. The Noble Practice comes after, and so we change it from Sila, Samatha, Pañña into Pañña, Sila, Samadhi, to where your behavior and your actions are actually the outcome of your mind that has been developed through wisdom.

**Speaker B:** Would you say another word for someone who understands precepts not just as a rule? You could say like wisdom-based restraint or something like that. Like you understand why you shouldn't do.

**Speaker A:** This, it's not just a rule.

**Speaker B:** So you could say these precepts, Dhammarato, are actually wisdom-based restraint. It's not just a rule, like you have to understand what is the purpose.

**Speaker A:** Of That's the mental attitude change that we have to make, is that the rules are the rules because somewhere in there, there was a point of wisdom. Now, can we dissect those rules to find where the wisdom was in the first place so that we can now not have to follow the rules, we follow the wisdom? In other words, the rule is thou shalt not shoplift, and that they're going to have cops and store managers and all of that kind of stuff to make sure that you don't shoplift, when in fact there's easy techniques that people can learn where they can shoplift and get away with things. That in fact Wall Street is full of shoplifters, the government is full of shoplifters, There's a distinction in our culture between what you do versus getting caught. It's okay to do it, but it's not okay to get caught. And so that's one of the rule changes. In fact, in the Spartan, you know, back in ancient Greece, they had Athens and they have Sparta. Here's how they changed, trained the kids in Sparta. Was that they would not feed the kids. The kids who were in the military training had to steal their food, but if they got caught, they got severely punished. So you got to go steal the food, but you got to make sure that you're watching so you don't get caught. And how can we change that point of view of don't get caught at what you're doing wrong into don't do wrong. Can we change that rule into wisdom so that we avoid the wrongdoing altogether as opposed to not getting caught at it? This is where Um, there's two Pali words that come into play: hara and upadana. And hara actually is shame over getting caught, to where, uh, upadana is much more like guilt in the sense of when you do wrong, you know it's wrong, and you want to avoid doing wrong. Or if you do do wrong, you want to fix it. To where in Arahant, which is most place people have, is that they want to avoid getting caught. And we wind up wanting to avoid getting caught in our own mind, so we become liars. We are in denial. We don't want to see our wrongdoing. We don't want to catch ourselves in the wrongdoing so that we'll feel okay. We don't want to become embarrassed even to ourselves, right? And that actually point makes the ordinary society a society of liars, because we don't want to take responsibility for our behavior because we don't want to get caught doing it. This is why the way that the Buddha talks about right view versus wrong view is that wrong view has the quality of, I can get away with it because nobody's watching. There's no mother, there's no father, there's no saints, there's no mystics, there's no this life and that life and the next life. There's none of that, and I'm unconstrained. And so I can go and do a drive-by shooting or whatever I want to do and get away with it.— as opposed to ordinary right view says, "You can't get away with it. We're going to catch you. We're going to hire police, and a military, and teachers, and uncles, and store clerks, and all kinds of people are going to watch you, and you're going to get caught at what you're doing. And if that don't work, we're going to hire a priest, who's going to track you down through next lives and punish you that way. And so our society is built upon Hairy, not Upadana. It's built upon not getting caught for our wrongdoing, and that creates then a different kind of mind state. We don't see the Dukkha, we try to hide from it instead, rather than avoiding it correctly. And so this is why the teaching is the way that it is, in the sense of we begin at one particular level, and good monks will teach new people about Sila, give them the precepts, give them the Triple Gem and expect them to learn to behave correctly. But the real training is mental from the very beginning. Now, most of the students who come to talk to me, they've already been through the society of thou shalt not get caught. They've already learned that pretty pretty well. So when they come, I will make the assumption that we can bypass the first part of the training that Samatha has been seen doing. I don't think that that's his major point, but it is a point of teaching. We have to teach children and even adults who don't have the wisdom to see Dukkha And so we make rules. And as children, we were rule-bound. How many rules do you have? Hello, Pedro. Oh, hello. We're actually in this talk talking about your question that you had yesterday.

**Speaker C:** Oh, wonderful, beautiful. Like, just in.

**Speaker A:** Time. Yes, you came in just in time. So we'll, we'll recover it just a little bit for you because, uh, nobody hears things correctly the first time anyway. So we can go over it again. And that is, is that we were— you were asking about Ajahn Sumedho discussion about teaching about Sila. And the point is, is that Sila is ordinary Buddhism, and that most monks start at that ordinary level of teaching, in the sense of the Eightfold Noble Path has a component of Sila, Samadhi, Pañña, to where The behavior is the way that people can look. I mean, the mind is actually quite subtle. It's hard for people to actually see how their thoughts work, but we can see behavior. And so if you can behave yourself, that takes mind in order to do the training of the behavior. And if you can go through the mental training for the beginner to get used to the point that you have to think about what you say and think about what you do. You start having to watch it. That will give you the preparation so that you can sit down and actually look at your mind and see the mind directly so that we can make the changes at that level. Rather than trying to avoid getting caught, because that's not the full point of the Sila. So if we misbehave but we get away with it, we get the idea that, oh, it's not getting caught, it's the important thing. But if the mental training is that you do it in a certain way because you begin to develop the mind state to do it in that particular way. Now yesterday I was on a call with a new student, and as I was going through, uh, the beginning Dhamma for him, he kept asking questions over and over again and started making statements about, well, I got to get it right, I want to know what you're saying. And then it it became quite clear to me that he wasn't really hearing what I had to say because he wasn't actually looking at his mind. He was still going on in the same method that he was before by asking questions about the practice rather than recognizing that all the practice is, is to look at your mind And I was inviting him to relax right now. Can you actually change, see what's in your mind and relax right now? And he kept coming back with this question and that question and could not see that he was in fact not relaxing at all. And this is exactly how most people do practice, by trying to get meditation right. Oh, if I just get it right, And then they can't get it right. Why? Because the whole point is to not get it right. The point is to see that you're trying to get it right and to stop doing that. That trying to get it right is not getting it right. Then instead, to get it right, we have to stop trying to get it right. It'd just be okay. That it's not a matter of rights and wrongs. That in fact, Sila, we think because of the Western mentality that the precepts in Buddhism are like commandments. And they're not commandments, they're just good ideas. It's wisdom. It's dangerous to go out killing people. You've heard expressions like He who lives by the sword dies by the sword. All right, he can be a really excellent swordsman, but he's going to get old, he's going to get sloppy, and he's going to get killed while he keeps carrying that sword around. Same thing happened with gunslingers in the old days. This is that they got a reputation for being a gunslinger, and now he wants to hang up that gun and stop doing that. But the young bucks who want to get a reputation by killing him, they won't let him do that. They keep making him strap that gun back on for one last gunfight. The same thing with the old sword masters in Japan. If you get a reputation, then people are going to test that reputation, even if you don't want to do it anymore. All right, so that's in fact exactly what happens to us out in society, is that when we really start to practice the Dharma, we won't— we don't want to do it the way that they do it in society anymore. We don't want to do it that way, but they want us to do it that way. They want us to keep fighting because that's the frame of reference that they're in. So, we have to understand, Pedro, that there are two levels of training. For the children, for the idiots, for the unwise, we give them the precepts which they buy into as rules. Oh, you should do this, you should do that. Rather than base our behavior upon wisdom. And the wisdom is, can you see the Dukkha so that you can come out of it? So, Pat, do you have any questions about this?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm just thinking about all the times that This is so very true that even if you— no matter how many rules you have, it does not bring the Dukkha to the end of it. It just never does. And I just think of so many things.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't matter how many rules you have or how good you are at keeping them, it does not bring the end of Dukkha. But it does prepare you. Yeah. So that you can do it right. Just like the first grade and the second grade prepares you for primary school or middle school, and middle school prepares you for high school, etc., like that. Or learning to play easy pieces of music because your normal beginning piano player cannot play a Rachmaninoff concerto. Doesn't matter how hard he tries, he's got to play stuff, or he has to do things that he can do. And that Buddhism is always generally taught from the beginning. And the beginning is Sila. You got to get your act together. And that's the beginning then of getting your mind together. And that's also the beginning of getting your view together. So once you get your right view going, Panna, that's when we convert from the ordinary path into the noble path. And so The actual Eightfold Noble Path is discussed in Sutta number 117, is not the Eightfold Noble Path that is normally taught in Western Buddhism or in the Thai children's Sunday school or anything like that. Because the foundation of the Noble Path is that you've got to see, you've got to look, you've got to pay attention. You've got to be mindful. You've got to open your mind to everything around you. And yet when we're doing Sila, Sila is more of a concentration that I've got to get this, that, and the other thing all lined up. I got to get these ducks in a row. The example that I used before, uh, in earlier in the call, Pedro, was that Ajahn Po put me out in Vindhibat with a robe that had to be held in a certain way, otherwise it would unravel, an umbrella, a bowl, a yam bag in a certain way over the arm, and the bowl cover, and had to manipulate all of that stuff while I was opening that bowl and holding the umbrella so that people could put food in And then I had to close that bowl and hold the umbrella correctly while I was holding the robe, all in the left hand. I guess I was kind of lucky because I was already left-handed. So a right-handed person, they would have trouble, you know, managing 3 things in your left hand. But that means concentration. So you could also go to say that you have to focus or concentrate the mind in order to do the Sila part. But then in the later point, we have to have the Sila down so that it automatically happens, and then we can open the mind into a vast area so that you could see everything around you. You can notice what's going on. You can see a little flash of lightning and know that thunder is coming so that you don't get shocked. You can smell the truck that's, you know, 50, 60 meters away. Not the instant that it starts up, but the wind travels pretty fast. And as soon as that truck starts up, I can hear it start up, and then I can smell the fumes of the diesel engine. Because we're paying attention to what's happening around us. That's the same way as the child in the piano learning chopsticks as a prelim to being able to play a little waltz, which is a prelim for playing a complicated waltz, which is then a prelim for doing a concerto. And everything is about training. So we train the mind by our behavior, because that's big and gross. The mind is the forerunner. Anything that you do has to put the mind into it. But once we get used to doing that very well, like in martial arts, the martial arts training for the white belt, the green belt, the brown belt, is all about getting the maneuvers and getting the skill of managing your behavior. But the real skill is with that behavior already built in as a skill. Now you have to pay attention, because when you're out in battle, arrows and swords and things like that can come from all directions. And you got to pay attention. All right, so Dukkha in our regular lives can come from all directions. We got to pay attention. That's why Samatha is not concentration. Samatha is gathering the whole show together so that you're mindful of watching what you see, what you smell, what you touch, what you feel, Everything that's going on, even the subtle vibrations of the electric power, and you tell that. So this is the way that we live our lives now, is because we're paying attention to the senses rather than spinning the mind trying to keep track of robes and bowls and umbrellas and yon bags. That's the beginner's training. That's the Sila. And so this is what, uh, Cat is learning, is he's learning the Thai culture. But the way that he's going to learn it is a whole lot better than the way that most Westerners learn, is because I'm teaching him to wake up and pay attention to what's going on around you. See how the Thai people behave so that you'll know. You don't have to keep making mistakes over and over again, getting caught, having to pay retribution, that whole Sila bag. Let's start with wisdom right from the very beginning. Let's start watching what we're doing. Pat, do you have anything to say about that? Alex, do you have anything to say about this?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, with these 3 trainings, this is how we fabricate the.

**Speaker A:** Path.

**Speaker D:** My understanding, yeah.

**Speaker A:** This is how we put it together, yeah.

**Speaker D:** One of the things that I want to hear about, if I could ask you to talk about it, is something I always find so interesting is when I look in the suttas in— is it the books of numbers? Is this what it's called?

**Speaker A:** The Anguttara. Yeah. Comes from the word angle or finger. It's the counting. Don't you count on your fingers?

**Speaker D:** We find it in the book of tens.

**Speaker A:** Yeah? Why is that? Pardon?

**Speaker D:** The Noble Eightfold Path, when we find it in the book, we find it in the Book of Tens.

**Speaker A:** Okay, right. Here's the reason why. That in fact, the Anguttara doing it that way proves that the people who wrote the Anguttara Nikaya already had access to the Anapanasati Sutta. And to the Great Forty, which is 117. So normally how I teach the Dhamma is I use these two suttas. The Anguttara follows this, and that is the Anapanasati Sutta and the Great Forty. One is the Eightfold Noble Path, and the other one is the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path. And in both of them. In fact, here's an interesting point. You, um, these numbers, especially the high, the Great Forty, 8 does not divide into the 8, into the Great Forty. But 10 does. 10 by 4 makes a whole lot of sense because you've got the Satipatthana, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, times 10. So there is in fact 10. What are the other 2? Are in fact the fulfillment of the 8. And what is those? Those 2 extra ones are called, um, knowledge and deliverance, which you could call then is the 2 forms of enlightenment. So the Eightfold Noble Path is the path to enlightenment, and then the ninth one is the knowledge of the path, and the number 10 is then the deliverance that the path brings. Now let's look at the word enlightenment for just a second, because the the knowledge and the deliverance is built into that word. That's why I'm not an enemy of the word enlightenment like I am the word meditation and whatnot, all right? Because in enlightenment we have two forms of light. We have shining a light, a flashlight, the light of day, and that has to do with being able to see because we shine a light on it. In other words, we begin to look at the mind and see it with light. But the next one is not heavy, that we lighten up, that we drop the burden. Once we see the burden with the first kind of enlightenment, then we drop the burden with the second kind of enlightenment, knowledge and deliverance. And so that makes the path then more complete, because if we just merely stop at perfection of behavior, that's not enough. We need also that extra knowledge of seeing what burdens we do carry to see the Dukkha, to see that we're trying to get it right, that trying to get it right, the rule of, oh, you've got to do it correctly, you got to get it right, that becomes the burden. Can we see that that's the burden so that we can in fact drop the burden? And how do we are able to see the burden is because we're taught to remember to look and to make a change, to remember to look, to make a change. And then when we get good at that, we look, we remember to look, make a change, and then congratulate ourselves for it, that I can do this. We change our attitude from the loser or the victim Every child is a victim, and one of the main things that we as children were victim to was the rules that you got to get it right, you got to do it this way, you're supposed to go to church, you're supposed to go to school, you got to do it right. And so we as children were raised with a set of rules that are not liberating. They're to fit into the society which is not liberated. And so these rules become a great burden to us. And so yesterday in that talk, I was actually able to convince this new student that he's got to look at the fact that he wants to get it right, he wants to understand, he wants to ask questions. And questions always come out of doubt, and doubt's a hindrance. If you can see that your questions are expressions of doubt, and that we can't be liberated if we're full of doubt, we have to remove these hindrances with right effort. We have to take the effort to remove them, but by removing the hindrance, that's almost like turning the light on. So that we could see the burden that we do carry and then drop it. So that's why the Eightfold Noble Path is in the tens, is because of the fulfillment that— in fact, another way of looking at it is the fulfillment of the Eightfold Noble Path is the Sambhojana the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. Why do these numbers change? Is because the practice changes as we gain skills, and we have to start off with no.

**Speaker D:** Skills.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I mean, a tender infant, they can't use their hands at all. Can you imagine a 1-year-old babe, or maybe even a toddler now given a robe, a bowl, a yon bag, a lid, and an umbrella? No. It took years to learn how to use my hands, to do music and do sports and to do all kinds of things so that I was ready to go through that intense training that Ajahn Po put me through. Wow. And what I was trying to do was to cheat. I thought I could get away with it by putting a string on that bowl to make it easier to carry. By the way, the bowls get really heavy when you've got your right hand holding that, the underside of that bowl. Your arm gets tired, so your left hand is really busy managing all the equipment while the bowl fills up with food and gets heavy. Yeah, so that, that's the training to go through. That's the Sila, that's the behavior. Everybody can see the monk out on Bendabout dropping his bowl. Not a thing to do. Yeah, not a thing to do, to drop the bowl. Big injunctions about even that when they set the bowl down after it's clean and dried, you can't put it on the table in an ordinary way. You have to put it far away from the edge. Why? Because in the time of the Buddha, the bowls didn't necessarily have flat bottoms, that they were dangerous. If somebody could walk across the floor and the bowl would rattle and shake, and it might fall onto the floor because of that. And so there's a whole lot of little things that we have to look at to manage in Sila. Yeah. And so Sila is the training that they put the monks through so that they could get ready for actually getting their act together, which is the Samatha and the concentration part, so that then they can get their view together that the Sila is not the ultimate training, it's the beginner's training. So when we turn it into the noble training, we start with wisdom, we start with looking and investigating, and then we wind up Because our mind is noble, our behavior is purified. But with that purification of behavior, that's still not the final point. The final point has to do with the joy, the relaxation, the paying attention that leads to that dynamic balance or equanimity. Upekkha is the Pali word for it. And that you could also use the word better than equanimity. A much better word would be equilibrium. Look at the word equilibrium, okay? Things are liberal, things are moving all the time. Can you keep a balance no matter what happens? Like a good martial artist, you cannot knock him down or push him over because he's got equilibrium. That equilibrium comes with being able to see in time to get out of the way so that you don't get bowled over. And so this is merely a process that we go through. So Sila, Samatha, Pañña is the process for the beginner until he gets the point that he's got to watch where he's going. The purification of view then becomes the Pañña, or the wisdom to look, to see, to notice the dots and how they connect together. So that then we can really get at the deeper level, the mind organized correctly. Getting just our behavior organized is not enough. We have to get the mind organized, and that organization, we could call it unification of mind, is one of the words that they use in the Suttas. But in Western Buddhism, they think that the the real practice is all about the concentration. Well, no, concentration is actually at the beginner's level of the Sila. But the real organization is an opening up, so that you allow everything. You become at one with your environment, so that you begin to smell the odors of those trucks that are 50 yards away. Catch the eye, uh, out of the corner of the eye, the lightning, so that you know that the thundering is coming. By the way, I got a story about that, and that was that there was one time when there was a lightning flash that was so bright that the entire, um, field of view— I don't know where the lightning was, but it must have been really, really close. Because it was followed by a clap of thunder instantly. It was almost at the same time. And when that clap of thunder happened, everybody in the house was off the floor. The dogs were literally in the air. Kitty was off the floor. I mean, when really big lightning or thunder happens that's really close by, It— you just jump, right, out of reaction. Why is that? Because they weren't ready for it. They didn't know it was going to happen. And here I am watching what's going on. There's other things that I've seen that's quite interesting. And from time to time, because we have the door open and we're in the, um, uh, the tropics here, that a bird will fly into the room It flies through the living room into the bedroom, makes a circle in the bedroom, goes back out the door, and I'm the only one who knows that the bird was in the room because Katie's looking at her cell phone. She does not have that peripheral perception that we have to develop so that we can see everything. Even though I'm looking at the cell phone, If something happens out on the road, I know it, because that's part of the training of opening up and gaining the sensory input that's available to us. Most people, you could then say, have tunnel vision. And the teaching of Sila actually is a process of teaching people tunnel vision. You got to learn all the rules, you got to do it correctly, you got to watch your step et cetera, like that, in those kinds of ways. But then we close down the mind into the set of rules that we have to follow. And what the real practice is, the noble practice, is to drop those rules and start paying attention to everything that's happening around you. So does anybody else have any more questions? Pedro, how about you? I know you came in a little bit late. It would be good if you watch this video because I was going into much more detail in the first part of the talk.

**Speaker C:** Oh yes, I will, I will, uh, rewatch the video.

**Speaker A:** Later. Right. By.

**Speaker C:** The way, I watched all the Sumedho's videos later on, and then.

**Speaker A:** He.

**Speaker C:** Moved on to our next topic. And in fact, that was very similar to the teaching I was used to. He talked about like being the witness and the Dharma as silence in the background of all that is happening. And so after that doubt on which I stopped and asked you, later on was more simple to understand his style of teaching also. Because he was talking about right view later, so it was more clear, right, as well.

**Speaker A:** So please understand that Achan Samatha and I had the same teachers, and he's going to have his unique way of talking about it. But Achan Samatha, he understands the distinction between starting with the Sila, as opposed to the supramundane, is starting with the wisdom, paying attention to what's going on. The Samadhi is the opening now, not the closing down. It's the opening, so that then the mind is completely free, and that leads then Once we have that opening and can see everything around us, that's where the knowledge comes. The light is on and you can see everything around you, including all of the rules that we carry that keep us burdened. So the deliverance really is the deliverance of no longer attaching to the way things are supposed to be and just enjoying the heck out of how things actually are. Yeah, the universe and my environment and all of these trees and everything around me do not follow the rules. The humans follow the rules, and because of that, they're bound by the rules. They're attached by the rules. They're enslaved by the rules. They're imprisoned by the way things should be. And the freedom is to live our lives the way things actually are. And I'm sure that Arhat and Samatha will say things very similar to that. So wakey wakey, watch what's going on, wake up. So this has been a really good talk. Anybody have any final things to say? Kat, you got any Last point.

**Speaker B:** No, it was just a reminder about that rules, because I've been talking about that with some guys on Discord about the pressure of the rule. That's when it comes up, it's like a pressure and feeling that you have to do something, or should be another way. And that when you actually have to look at that pressure in the mind.

**Speaker A:** Rather than— You have to look at that, exactly. That would be the same thing as being in a hurry to meet a deadline. If we've got deadlines and we actually see that as a rule, we wind up being in anxiety, uptight. We cannot even perform as well. Rather than saying, hey, I can do it as I please. Start enjoying your life instead of being in a hurry. There are no rules. There is only Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So we could say that that's the rule. The entire teachings of the Buddha is the rule, and they can be summed up in a couple of words. Like, don't worry, be happy. Sometimes you feel like a nut. Yeah, and that's okay, because sometimes you don't. Yep. Accept the fact that we're dynamic. Yeah, things are changing, things are moving. Let's not have rules about how things are supposed to be because no Nothing ever follows any rules, and when the human follows the rules, they wind up in discomfort, dissatisfaction. What a relief to shine a light on that stuff and then put it down, stop carrying it around. Thank you, guys.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Thank you, friends.

**Speaker A:** Do you have any last points to make? Never mind. All right, thank you. Go.

**Speaker C:** Ahead.

**Speaker A:** Oh, thank you. All right, great. Alex, thanks for joining us. I really appreciate your humor and your, your, your aliveness.

**Speaker D:** I can't hear the Dharma without feeling joy like that, Dhammarato. It just doesn't happen. Much love, guys. I'll talk to you all soon.

**Speaker A:** All right, see ya.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, centers on a question about two seemingly different approaches to Buddhist teaching: one that emphasizes **Sila (moral behavior)** first (as exemplified by Ajahn Sumedho), and Dhammarato's own approach, which starts with the **mind and wisdom (Pañña)**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. Two Levels of Dhamma: Ordinary and Noble**
Dhammarato explains there are two levels or methods of teaching:
*   **Ordinary/Beginner's Dhamma:** Starts with **Sila (moral discipline)**. This is the foundational training, especially for newcomers, children, or monastics. It involves following precepts and rules (like not killing, not stealing) to shape behavior and speech over time. This is the classic sequence: **Sila → Samadhi (concentration) → Pañña (wisdom)**.
*   **Supramundane/Noble Dhamma:** Starts with **Pañña (wisdom or right view)**. This is for those ready to look directly at the mind. Here, the sequence is inverted: **Pañña → Samadhi → Sila**. Pure behavior becomes the natural *outcome* of a purified and wise mind, not a set of rules to follow.

### **2. The Central Role of the Mind**
Regardless of the starting point, the mind is the **forerunner**. Changing behavior (Sila) requires mental effort and mindfulness. The ultimate goal of all training is to work with the mind directly.

### **3. The Limitation of Rules and the Primacy of Wisdom**
*   Beginner's Sila training uses rules and structure (like a "moral straitjacket" or the precise handling of a monk's robes and bowl) to cultivate mindfulness and attention.
*   However, a rule-based mentality ("I must get this right") can later become a **hindrance** to deeper practice, creating pressure and anxiety.
*   True freedom comes from **wisdom-based restraint**—understanding the *why* behind precepts. It's seeing the **Dukkha (suffering, danger)** in unskillful actions (e.g., seeing how shoplifting creates danger, not just that it's a rule). This shifts motivation from avoiding punishment (*hiri* - shame) to avoiding the unwholesome act itself because you understand its consequences (*ottappa* - moral dread).

### **4. Practical Examples and Analogies**
*   **Martial Arts:** Beginner training (colored belts) is about learning correct forms and movements (Sila). Real combat requires open, panoramic awareness to respond to anything (Noble Samadhi).
*   **Cultural Training:** For Western monks in Thailand, learning monastic Sila is also learning Thai culture—a necessary foundational training.
*   **Personal Story:** Dhammarato shares how he only stopped shoplifting when he finally saw the *danger* in it, not because of external rules. He also recounts the intense mindfulness training from his teacher, Ajahn Po, who made him manage multiple items (robe, bowl, umbrella) on alms round—a Sila training that was fundamentally a **mindfulness drill**.

### **5. The Goal: Liberation from the Burden of Rules**
The Noble Path aims at **enlightenment** in two senses:
1.  **Shining a light** on the mind to see our burdens (like the pressure of rules and "shoulds").
2.  **Lightening up**—dropping those burdens.
The final state is not rigid concentration but a dynamic **equilibrium (upekkha)**, where one is open, aware, and in balance with the changing flow of experience, free from the imprisonment of how things "are supposed to be."

### **Conclusion: Reconciling the Two Approaches**
Dhammarato clarifies that Ajahn Sumedho's Sila-first approach is **correct and necessary** for beginners and in specific contexts (like monastic training). His own wisdom-first approach is tailored for students who have already internalized basic societal rules and are ready to investigate the mind directly. Both methods come from the same source (they had the same teachers) and ultimately lead to the same point: **waking up, paying attention, and being free from suffering.** The path evolves from the structured focus of Sila to the open, wise awareness of the Noble practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the difference between beginner-level "ordinary" practice (focused on rules/sila) and advanced "supramundane" practice (focused on wisdom/paññā). Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**
1.  **Martial Arts Belts:** The progression through colored belts (white, green, brown) is used as a metaphor for the beginner's training in **Sila** (behavioral rules). This trains the body. However, the "real fight" depends on **awareness**—watching with your eyes, being ready from all directions. This represents the shift to the noble path, where wisdom and open awareness are paramount, not just rule-following.
2.  **Body Cast / Straitjacket:** The monastic robe, especially when worn formally and tightly for alms round, is compared to a **body cast or straitjacket**. This illustrates how beginner **Sila** can feel restrictive and confining—a necessary but ultimately preliminary training that must be internalized and then transcended.
3.  **Musical Training:** Learning simple pieces like "chopsticks" before advancing to waltzes and eventually complex concertos is a metaphor for the **gradual training path**. You must start with the basic rules (Sila) to develop the foundational skills needed for the higher, freer practice of wisdom and open awareness.
4.  **Equilibrium vs. Rigidity:** The speaker contrasts **equilibrium** (a dynamic, flexible balance, like a skilled martial artist who can't be knocked over) with **rigid rule-following**. The noble path aims for this adaptable, wise equilibrium, not just static correctness.
5.  **Two Types of Enlightenment/Light:** The word "enlightenment" is broken into two metaphorical lights:
    *   **A flashlight** (knowledge): Shining a light to see the mind and its burdens.
    *   **Becoming light** (deliverance): The subsequent "lightening up" and dropping of those burdens.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Shoplifting Story:** The speaker's personal history of shoplifting from childhood into adulthood illustrates the difference between **rule-based morality** (don't get caught) and **wisdom-based restraint**. He only stopped when he truly saw the *dukkha* (danger, inherent unsatisfactoriness) in the act, not because of an external rule.
2.  **The Butcher's Moment of Clarity:** The story of a rabbi or mullah who, on a good day, looks into a goat's eyes and cannot perform the ritual slaughter. This illustrates **purity of mind arising from wisdom**, which naturally leads to moral action, surpassing any external religious rule or precept.
3.  **Monastic Training with Bowl & Robe:** The detailed story of his rigorous training under Ajahn Po—managing robe, umbrella, bowl, and alms bag simultaneously on barefoot walks—is a central parable. It shows how the **outward focus on Sila (rules and form)** is actually a **mindfulness training**. The attempt to "cheat" by adding a strap to the bowl was instantly seen by his teacher, driving home the lesson of constant, precise awareness.
4.  **The Lightning and Thunder:** The speaker's observation of a distant lightning flash, which allowed him to anticipate the thunderclap, is a story demonstrating **peripheral awareness**. This is contrasted with others (and animals) being startled by a sudden, unexpected clap. It symbolizes the noble practice of being openly aware of one's entire environment, not just narrowly focused on rules.
5.  **The Bird Flying Through the Room:** A brief anecdote where a bird flies in and out of the house, noticed only by the speaker because his partner was focused on her phone. This reinforces the theme of **"tunnel vision" (Sila-focused concentration) vs. open, panoramic awareness (supramundane samadhi)**.

### **Core Narrative Framework**
The entire talk is structured around a **two-level metaphor**:
*   **The Ordinary/Beginner's Path:** Characterized by **Sila-first** training, likened to a **body cast, martial arts drills, and learning musical scales**. It's rule-bound, time-oriented, and focuses on correct behavior.
*   **The Supramundane/Noble Path:** Characterized by **Paññā-first** understanding, likened to **dynamic equilibrium, a master's awareness in a fight, and playing a concerto with feeling**. It's wisdom-based, present-moment oriented, and focuses on seeing *dukkha* and releasing burdens.

The stories and metaphors all serve to make this central distinction vivid and memorable.
