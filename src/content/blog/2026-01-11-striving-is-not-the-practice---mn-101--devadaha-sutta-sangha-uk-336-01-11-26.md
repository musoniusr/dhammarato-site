### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello folks. Today is Sunday afternoon, the 11th of January, and today's talk is going to be a follow-on for what we talked about yesterday. And in that regard, we'll start off the same way that we did start yesterday, and that was with the question of Which comes first, Dukkha or Sukkha? Which is basically the same question as which came first, the chicken or the egg, and naturally eggs were prehistoric and chickens were from the 17th century, so we know that eggs came long before chickens. However, the question of which comes first pleasure or displeasure? Ivan, you already know the answer to this, but Amrit doesn't, probably. Let's check you out. Amrit, do you know which came first, pleasure or displeasure?

**Speaker B:** I don't know the answer.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Timo? Pleasure. Yes, which comes first, pleasure or displeasure?

**Speaker B:** Pleasure, you said yesterday.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, you were there yesterday. Okay, all right, so that blows it. I don't get to ask everybody else because you already knew the answer. All right, so let's discuss that just a little bit. And that is that most ordinary people, and therefore most spiritual practices, start with the idea that displeasure or pain comes first, followed by more pain of getting rid of the pain in order to create pleasure, if there's ever any to be found. But the Buddha says no, if you look specifically at Paticcasamuppada, where we recognize that pleasure feelings, when they are avoided, will lead to dissatisfaction. So pleasure comes first, And when pleasure is not quenched or relinquished, that leads to dissatisfaction. And this is really an important point. So today we're going to be talking about Sutra number 111, the Devadattu Sutta, that is a conversation with the Buddha and the Nagatas, who was led by Naga Nakaputta. Now, modern scholarship says that this is the remnants, or the remnants of that is now modern Jainism. However, Jainism in India as it's practiced has very little to do with the, uh, the Nātanas in the sutta, that the sutta starts out talking about it in the sense of— but let's give a little bit of background— is that what the Jains practiced then were austerities, with the idea that they are born in this life with Dukkha from the prior life. And that their job is to try to roast or burn off that Dukkha so that they can be free from Dukkha in this life. However, their idea of, let us say, this Kamma, this old actions that they had, was almost like a physical thing. That stuck to the soul, which is like a physical thing, and that by burning off this old Kamma, that would give them good results. So when the Buddha got there, he talked to them about it and then basically asked them 10 questions, which we'll talk about fairly soon, to get them to understand that they don't know what was in the past. He asked them directly, do you know that you were in the past? Do you know what the suffering that you have now, where does it come from in the past? Also, how far along are you? Have you burned up half of it, or have you In other words, what's there that you have done, and what's there that you haven't done? And these guys couldn't answer any of those kinds of questions. He then talked to them about, well, if self-flagellation, if austerities that cause Dukkha in the present moment is purifying, then sick people people in prisons and animals in certain conditions would already be enlightened because they suffered so much. Doesn't that make sense? It's like this thing that we have in the West of 'no pain, no gain.' Well, the guys who take that 'no pain, no gain,' they pain themselves at the gym And what they gain is a whole lot of muscle. However, they still with the muscle have the same Dukkha, the same suffering. Their pain does not make them feel happy. It makes them feel strong maybe, but not— in fact, what they do is they compete with each other for who's the strongest. And as one ages, even if he is the strongest, he will either kill himself with his activities, or grow flabby like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who basically doesn't practice the way he did when he was Mr. Universe. And so, that whole idea of "no pain, no gain" is much more of Let's have pain, but we're still not going to get any gain from it. And that's exactly what was happening with these Jains that the Buddha was talking about, that there is no release from suffering through striving. Now, an interesting point about that is, is that after this conversation with them, the Buddha left and he went back and reported this conversation. And then he— we're talking about it correctly. And in the Pali there is a change of language, and the change of language would be from the Jains they were talking about, the austerities. The Pali word is tapa, and that the Buddha's word that he's using is the word Upadana. And yet the translators use the same word. So I'm talking about this sutta because of Jhana's asking a question yesterday of why, if the Jains are doing all this striving, why is it that the Buddhist path is defined as striving? The answer to that is, that's a bad translation. The translator probably didn't even understand the sutta that he was translating. He was more translating words in the sense of, uh, you can't see the forest for the trees. Well, the whole point of this sutta is to stop your striving for perfection or for having a nice life, that in fact the striving that you do is work, it's actually Dukkha. And that was one of the questions that the Buddha asked the Jains is, in this current life, if you practice and have austerities in this life, how will it help you in this life? And they had no answer. If you have austerities and reburning off of that Kamma, how do you know that that's going to be reflected in your next life? And they don't know. So they were just going by what they were told. And so the Buddha talks then about it in— and let us— I think he said 5 different things can have 2 different results. One would be faith, or Shraddha, followed by application listening to the teacher and other things like that can come into two different directions. One is either if you're doing the right thing, then you will have release from suffering. But because they had faith in Nagarjuna, their teacher, who is now referred to as Mahavira, they would listen to him, they would practice the way that he would tell them to practice, but they wouldn't get any result out of it no matter how much faith or how much effort or striving they put in for it. So this word Upadana is also very close to the word, in its usage, to the word Viriya that is used as energy in the Satipatthana. And what we mean by that word Viriya It's the same word that we have in English, like being virile, being strong, being vital. In the French, they say vive la France, long live France. That's what we're looking for, is a strength that's not really strong because of endurance or because of strenuous exercise. But that it is a force of nature, basically, or a feeling really good. That when you feel really good, you do feel strong and powerful, as opposed to those who try to gain their virility through strong effort. So this is the situation. That we come to in this sutta. And now the next part of the sutta has to do with a lot of what I would call boilerplating. In fact, there's a long, large section of this that is the same as in Sutta 38, that has the story of a child is born, he grows up in that society, Then he hears the Dhamma, he takes faith in the Dhamma, he ordains and joins with the Buddha, then he does various activities like Sila and guarding the senses, and then practicing the Jhanas so that he can come to the point. And this is all— this boilerplate is actually quite backwards because the real point is that The third watch of the night comes as deliverance, which means the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. Basically, we can say then that somehow or another built into the, to the suttas, winds up being two different pathways. One is the slow gradual path that has a lot to do with behavior and then practice coming to wisdom. They call it the Sila, Samadhi, Pañña, but really the path can start immediately with Pañña, the wisdom, and that means the wisdom of the Four Noble Truths. There's no reason to go through this long process because if you practice the direct path and become noble, your nobility, the strength of the mind, and also the purification of the mind, the Samadhi mind, the mind that doesn't want anything, will wind up having good Sila automatically. Because the mind is pure, you don't go around doing impure things. So working hard and striving to resist things that are not good for you without that wisdom is just ordinary practice. This is what all the people do. But if we start the path with the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths, then we can make the fast progress that the Buddha talks about that gives us that right noble effort I will define the right noble effort as just the smallest or least amount of effort necessary to actually get the job done, and that there are four right efforts. One right effort is to diminish the unwholesome, to take it down a notch or two or three. Then the second one is to stamp it out completely, to become rid of unwholesome thoughts, even if they come back at a later time. The next one would be— the third one is to develop and start to foster and grow wholesome thoughts. And then the fourth one would be completing that to where you have full-blown wholesome thoughts. Now this is all done in the moment, it's easy to do, and yet most of the people who come out of ordinary life, when they come to the teaching of the Buddha, they automatically go on the gradual path, thinking that it's a long-term process and that they're looking for ultimate truth and ultimate facts to where in fact In reality, there is no ultimate reality. The thing that's the closest that we can come to of ultimate reality is actually just reality itself by looking directly, and you can see it immediately if you look directly. So there's no ultimate truth, there's no ultimate reality, there's only actual reality that can be seen clearly through investigation and looking. Now, the last thing that I want to say about this is that modern Vipassana, the Buddhist practice they call Western Buddhism, that is a dry Vipassana practice, is exactly the same thing that the Jains were doing. Except that instead of doing physical exercises and austerities, they would do them mentally. Well, even some physical exercises, like staying in a posture far too long for the body, and so they begin to have a lot of pain by sitting still. Goenka is the one who's the most famous for this, calling it a strong determination. Other practices, though, would be like the Buddha talks about wakefulness, to be able to look, to see, to be awake, and that some of the well-known Western teachers turn that into sleep deprivation. Well, guess what? When someone is sleep deprived, how awake and alert are they, Timo? Aren't people who are sleep deprived, aren't they sleepy?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it can be difficult.

**Speaker A:** And so sleep deprivation. And they also, they've nailed it when they call it dry. And yesterday we labeled that the opposite of dry is not wet, the opposite of the dry is what, Mr. Ben?

**Speaker B:** Joyful? Joyful.

**Speaker A:** We labeled it as juicy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's it, juicy.

**Speaker A:** Juicy, yes, that's what we labeled it as instead of being dry. It's juicy, which is exactly what you mean by joyful. And that we can cultivate that joy through right noble effort that is not demanding or striving or working hard. And that you'll see in especially the Mahasi group, those that— not Mahasi Samadhi, the Burmese teacher who died in 1982, I think, but modern Mahasi method seems to be caught in a dichotomy. The first side of it is that they teach noting. You note and you note and you see Dukkha and you keep noting it and keep noting it with the hope that if I keep seeing this Dukkha, it will melt away. Well, that's exactly what the Jains were doing when they would say, oh, we can beat the badness out of us. No, you can't Dukkha your way out of Dukkha. That's not the way that the Buddha teaches. You can't Dukkha your way out of the Dukkha. You've got to change the Dukkha. And not only that, but changing the Dukkha right now is easy. And then they say, well, what about the future? And okay, so a future moment comes, It's easy at that point in time to change the Dukkha into Sukkha, right then and there. And they say, well, what about all time? The answer is, as the Buddha says, is that all is a mental concept. That the only thing that we do have in fact is right here, right now. So we don't have to think of the whole path or what it's going to be like later. But what we do know, based upon what the Buddha teaches, is that if right here, right now, you are free from Dukkha, that's the whole path right then and there. And then the next thought would be, can you then see that thought and change it to wholesome until we gain the skill? And that skill, then, that right noble effort to be able to remember to look and to see and to change, and we do that over and over again. And fairly soon it becomes easier and easier to do it. That's where it becomes energetic. This is the Viriya or the viral that I was talking about, that in the beginning it does take effort, but the effort should never be strenuous effort. It should always be happy effort until that viral or that virile nature arises, that energetic feeling. So, we find ourselves in two different Buddhisms. One is the easy, happy, quick path that the Buddha teaches, and then the normal Western Buddhist and Buddhism path of a long, slow slog that is striving and hoping to get rid of the Dukkha without doing it. And the whole point is, is that if they take that path, will they ever come to the wisdom of seeing the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path and start practicing correctly right here, right now? So Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** I was thinking it's interesting, like even if someone were to think about like, what about the whole path? Like they are still coming from an unwholesome mind state. Like I think that's the funny thing about philosophy or intellectualization, because most of the time you probably already begin from an unwholesome state of mind. And that's the Mara's domain. That's playing Mara's game. I think that's so interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's true. And the interesting thing that I said yesterday was, is that when Western Buddhism with this dry Vipassana, this noting method, came to the West. It came with psychologists. It was a set of psychologists that went to Asia in the 1970s, and when they got there, the monks did not teach them the Noble Path because they weren't going to be there long enough. And so they taught them what is called the shortcut method. To where it's not the shortcut method. The shortcut method is the direct method, but Vipassana was designed for laypeople to at least get them started. However, if they stay in Vipassana, they stay in that striving, in that tortured place. Now here's something that's very interesting. It also has the quality of wanting things. Now, I have said before, and one of the students called me on it when I said that the teaching of the Buddha is not for attaining anything, that it's a dead loss. Basically, it's not a dead loss, but it is a major loss because you're losing everything that prevents you from being in pleasure, from being joyful, from being happy. And a dead loss would mean to lose that too. So it's not really a dead loss. It's just the burden is dropped so that the energy and the feeling of we've got this is energetic. Now, another important point about that is, is that because the Mahasi people were so greedy for experience they started in a practice that would be called deep meditation. That deep meditation actually has now also been called or labeled— in fact, I think it's been called this since the Vasudhi Marga— would be Vipassana jhanas. Now, the important point is, is that the actual jhanas The first Jhana is built upon Sukkha, is built upon having a mind free from hindrances, is built upon joy, and that joy goes so great that we would rather feel that joy than think about the joy, and so the thoughts begin to melt away. This is the actual process. However, that's not done or taught in the Mahasi Method, and they have something else that they call deep meditation, which is probably something like a trance, and they want something out of it. Hello, Christina. So this trance that they get into, they want something out of it. That in fact, one of the things that I hear that they're wanting would be to see their past lives. Well, they're not going to be able to do that with the practice that they have, and that there's good indication that that boilerplate that was put in there for the first watch of the night was just boilerplate that was put in there. That the Buddha would say, which would be better for you, the first watch of the night or the third watch of the night? The first watch of the night is to recollect— actually, the word in Pali is dwellings or homes, houses, past homes that we've lived in. And that the question that I ask is, which would be better for you to know your past well, or how far back you want to go, or to be Let us say, in the understanding of deliverance through the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, that we don't really have to go through this state of knowing our past lives. And yet this is something that the Mahasi group, they really strive for. Oh, they really want to be able to see the past. Oh, they go so deep into meditation. And when they come out, they're frustrated because they never get what they're looking for. But they might have an experience that they occasionally like, and so they'll go run to the teacher and say, "Oh, teacher, teacher, I had this marvelous experience." And then these modern teachers will say, "Oh, well, that means that you've attained something like Srotapanna." The fact is that Sotapanna, as we've talked, is not an attainment. It's much more of a dedication to the Dhamma. And people can have all kinds of experiences. In fact, each one of you is having an experience right now. So much for experiences. You have one experience after another. Every now that comes up, there's an experience. Why would you cling to one But this does happen. And in fact, I've had students saying, oh, I had first Jhana, but now I can't get back into it. Well, the reason you can't get back into it now is because you want it now. And guess what? First Jhana does not come from wanting first Jhana. First Jhana comes from being satisfied with having what you already have. And so there's a lot of mistakes that people make with this, and they all boils down to and back to the point of which came first, Sukkha or Dukkha. And when we see that the first one is always the, uh, the first one, and that is pleasure, then when we work at it, what we're actually not really working, but we're actually converting the pleasure from unwholesome pleasure, sensual pleasures, outside pleasures, into wholesome mental internal pleasure. And when we convert the outside pleasure that is often, let us say, roadblocked or thwarted, and we don't get what we want, including these guys who were meditating themselves into wanting some sort of an experience, the experiences are going to be basically— the experiences that they do have are going to be painful because they're not the experiences that they want. But if you're able to be in a state where you're really satisfied with what you have, that's an experience worth having— being satisfied. And so this is the teaching of the Buddha. And so the last point, I'll go to Ioannis on this. What do you think about this sutra that you came up with where it looks like that the translators are saying that you have to strive to find the wholesome?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's as you said, there's like the two ways of doing it. Because from what I read and understood, it says that sometimes giving up things can be painful, but then after you do it, you stop. He also says with the analogy of the arrows, that he puts the arrow between two fires. After one, he stops it. He doesn't just keep burning and burning. All right, for practical purpose, basically.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's investigate that for a second. When you say giving up will be painful, isn't that the same giving up as somebody taking it away from you? Like maybe a teacher saying you should stop doing that, and so you give it up painfully? Yeah, as opposed to you see it You see the dangers in it, and then you find the escape. And that escape then is not painful. And yet the Vipassana system, the dry insight method, is to give things up painfully. And there's never any striving and never to give up anything, that you will give it up when you see that it's not useful, wholesome, or beneficial to you. And you'll automatically be rid of it because you see that it is not useful. And in fact, we can do that pretty, pretty quickly. But if you give it up because you're supposed to give it up, that's like being robbed. You still want it. You still want it. And now you're giving it up and you still want it. That's what makes it painful, is because you're giving up the practice or giving up the item but you're not giving up the Tanha. You still want it. The right way to do it is to see through it clearly, see it with wisdom, recognize the danger, take your escape, remove the Tanha, and just like it without wanting it. And when you don't want it anymore, giving it up is easy. Isn't that the case, Janusz?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. In fact, that's also like how I quit smoking. Like, it was very easy for me, like, after I saw clearly. But yeah, it seems to be saying that sometimes you could like both work. Like, after, even if you're like, if it's painful afterwards, you can like realize you can realize afterwards, like when you don't have it anymore. Like if you go in and be like a monk in the forest for a year and you don't do certain things for a while, then like you can reflect, oh, actually I'm good without them anyways. Like that's what I took from this.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but the easy way to do it is by seeing directly. You don't have to go to the forest for a year. And have them not there, still wanting them and hoping that the wanting and the desire and the Dukkha of not having it will rot away. It might not rot away. You may be in Dukkha and the first thing you do after you get out of that year-long retreat in the woods is take his pack of cigarettes, smoke all of them all at once.

**Speaker D:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's not that— that's the Western mindset, is to do without long enough so that you don't want it anymore. And that will never cure the disease. The disease— the cure for the disease is seeing directly how dangerous it is so that you want to get rid of it. And then getting rid of it is easy and painless. So what do you think, Yanis?

**Speaker D:** Yes, yes, I see that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the last point on that for you is that the guy who you read that translated that page that you sent to the Bhikkhuni online for us on Discord, he didn't. He couldn't see that. That's why he continued to use the word striving, even though the Buddha had changed language, that it was the Jains who were striving, but the Buddha changed that word to padhana, and the padhana then was translated not as effort or energy or right effort. It was translated into striving. There's other places, by the way, in various suttas where the word striving is used, and in all cases the word striving is not correct. There is never a place where you should strive for anything. That in fact, even if you're in a race, say a long race or marathon race, and you've gotten about two-thirds way through the race, and now the race is killing you, and it is hard to take one more step, and one more step. Well, guess what? You might not even finish the race anyway. Why don't you just sit down right now and take it easy? Why do you have to finish the race? Why do you want to have some piece of paper saying he came in at 190th of the race? There's no reason to do that. Don't strive. When you're running and it's fun to run, run, enjoy. But when you get tired and it becomes striving, it's time to quit. So Paul, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** A good reminder to not have to strive and rather act from wisdom of understanding the danger in it.

**Speaker C:** What I've observed is that it takes.

**Speaker B:** Some looking to even, to really see the danger in certain aspects, certain things. See the unwholesome in it, to really take up that right effort to drop it again and again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when it comes up and you can say, wow, then look at that crap. I make that shit up. Let me drop that. Drop it happily. Okay, B, what do you have to say? I'll wait on B. Christina, what do you have to say? You came in a little late, but you got part of this anyway. What do you think?

**Speaker E:** Good morning. Yeah, so the question of, you know, what came first, Sukkha or Dukkha? I know when I heard the talk, the US talk the other day, it made sense to me that Sukkha was first without kind of going further because you know, everything is fine, everything is okay. And if you come from the state of the cup being empty and the cup and being in need, then of course you're going to be miserable. So I kind of thought it made sense. So That's it. Good morning. Good to see you guys.

**Speaker A:** Ivan, do you have any more to say?

**Speaker C:** No, it's nice to know you have a choice. Like you don't have to, you don't have to follow that story or that thoughts of striving and stuff like that. That's why Sati is so important. You have to keep sharpening it and training it because sometimes the old feeling and memory do come up really fast. So that's why we have to be ready, but not in anxiety stage, just like be ready to catch it if we do.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you can be on guard and still be relaxed. In fact, being on guard to be relaxed. And when you're on guard relaxed, and when something comes up, I see you, I got you. And so when we see Mara, I got you, that is that energy that we're talking about, that Upadana, to be able to see it, and to see it happily, so that you never get into, "Oh, poor me, I haven't meditated in a month, and now I know I should meditate, but I—" And so you can see the Dukkha in that. The question is, can you see that Dukkha when you do that? Or can you say, "Hot dog!" I don't care how long it's been, I can do it. I can do it right now. This is what makes the path immediate.

**Speaker C:** I have heard that, I heard from somewhere like an Arahant gains, have a lot of pleasure when they see all the old conditioning and not having to fall for that anymore. There's a lot of pleasure to be found.

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, yeah, it's like looking in a kind of a rearview mirror and see all that crap you left behind. Glad to do that anymore. Those on the correct path, when they see that stuff in the rearview mirror, they'll begin to remorse just a little bit. Oh no, I've lost something. But when we break that next step of, oh no, I haven't lost anything, I'm much better off without that stuff now, then we don't have to have any regrets, any remorse. We can say, wow, I'm good enough right this very minute. That's what makes the path actually so pleasurable, so enjoyable, and so Fruitful, juicy, the juicy fruit of the path.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's almost like there's no need to endure grief. There's no need to endure regrets and all that kind of stuff. You can just see that it's just Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. So, Phay Van, what do you have to say?

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato, actually I have a question.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker F:** So just wanted to better understand. So let's say I had a conversation with somebody. I felt resentful at that person because that person came out to me as some kind of dishonest. And let's say a week later I.

**Speaker A:** Realized— I didn't catch that word.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, came out to me. I perceived that person as dishonest.

**Speaker A:** Dishonest. Okay, I got you now.

**Speaker F:** Dishonest. That's why I become resentful. But I wasn't aware of that. And let's say a week later I'm meeting that person. And I already feel this poison inside of me that probably I created at the first meeting with that person.

**Speaker A:** So when you have that meeting, the next meeting with that person, you will feel an aversion to his dishonesty. Is that correct?

**Speaker F:** Yes, yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, is there an absolute good reason to actually meet him again?

**Speaker F:** Well, in the life, not always I choose who I meet.

**Speaker A:** Well, if he is deceitful, then maybe that which you think you're going to gain by being around him, you're not going to get it anyway because he's deceitful anyhow. Is that the case?

**Speaker F:** It might be.

**Speaker D:** Um, it might be.

**Speaker F:** The case that I am wrong. Maybe.

**Speaker A:** So maybe you would be wrong. So then the result then would— you probably would be better without going to meet him. You could sit happily saying, wow, I'm glad I don't have to do that.

**Speaker F:** Okay. Okay, I thought you were going to say that maybe diverting attention to some thoughts, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Right, so you're thinking that I'm going to say, oh, you ought to go meet this guy and have some strenuous work to listen to what he has to say, even though you know he's dishonest. No, I'm not going to say that. I'm going to take the Buddha's way out. Let's take a hike. Let's avoid Dukkha wherever it may be found. And go for pleasure wherever it may be found.

**Speaker F:** Okay. Yeah, that adds something to this picture, something valuable. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right. So, Krishnaji, what do you think? So, yes.

**Speaker B:** All right. Well, I have a question too. Yesterday I was reading about frustration, and do you think there's a difference between frustration and dissatisfaction?

**Speaker A:** Well, why would you want to make a distinction? Why don't you just, whatever it is, Drop it, get rid of it, throw it out. Take the right noble effort to— what, because both of them sound to me to be Dukkha based upon the way that you've talked about it. So there's no reason— you may have heard this story before, let me tell it again. It's an interesting story. You're walking down the sidewalk and there, as you're walking right in your path, you see a pile of dog dookie. There's 3 things to do. One is to ignore it and step right in it and have dog dookie all over your foot. That's what they call choiceless awareness. I see it, I'm awareness, but I'm not going to make any choices. I'm just going to step in it. And then the second one would be the Buddhist path, which is to say, see that dog dookie and step around it. Or you can take the method that you're thinking about, which is also very close to the Mahasi method of grabbing that dog dookie, taking it into your kitchen, dissect it, cut it up, examine it, powder it, put it in the blender, fry it in the pan, and eat it. So which of those three best things to do? To step in it even though you see it, to avoid it, or to play with it?

**Speaker B:** I would choose avoiding it.

**Speaker A:** So if you see it, just stay out of its way. That's the right noble effort, is just to step around it. It's not correct to play with the Dukkha. That's what people have been doing for centuries. That's exactly what this whole talk has been about with the Jains. It's Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha. Let's beat the Dukkha out of us. More Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** So there are different kinds of Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** But it's only one kind of Dukkha. There is only one kind of Dukkha, that which you either experience or avoid. That's the only kind there is. Your choice: are you going to avoid it? Are you going to remove it? Or are you going to keep it? Once you keep it, you can dissect it into a thousand different pieces. You can examine it, you can put labels on it, you can do all kinds of things, but the best thing to do is to avoid it as soon as you see Dukkha as Dukkha, is just to get rid of it happily. Aha, I see that, and then don't deal with it anymore. In actual practice, take a deep breath. Wow, I don't have to deal with that Dukkha. Does that make sense for you?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Just to add, the reason I was asking is before we kind of translate Dukkha as dissatisfaction, but I don't hear the word frustration as often. And I was just wondering if it's the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Right. Frustration is a form of Dukkha. Let me put it this way. We've got feelings that go into two groups. One is based in fear., and the other one is not based in fear. That which is based in fear is actually fear, remorse, frustration, anger, grief, sadness, longing, and love. And then when you are free from fear, the other side of it is going to be joy, Happiness, satisfaction, success, easygoing, empty— those are going to be one side or the other. And so there are many different kinds of dissatisfaction. There's many different kinds. Let's not figure out which one it is. Let's just drop it as a.

**Speaker C:** Group.

**Speaker A:** So come out of the fear, come out of the anxiety, come out of the frustration, because frustration is clearly and obviously not getting what you want. But if you like it and don't want it, then there's no.

**Speaker C:** Frustration.

**Speaker B:** Did you say love was in the fear group, or did I miss— I.

**Speaker A:** Said love is in part of that desire, longing, lust, clinging, wanting, wanting pleasure that you're not sure whether you're going to have or not. The Buddha didn't use the word love. The word love is very Christian-oriented word that's embedded deeply into our.

**Speaker E:** Society. It would make sense though that it was in the fear group, in that like kind of sequence of— yeah, it would make sense that it was in the fear group because then you're, you're afraid of, of losing— right, you're afraid.

**Speaker A:** Of losing your love.

**Speaker F:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** To where friendship, Sangha, there's no need to be afraid of losing it. Your friends are not going to disappoint you, and if they are, they weren't friends in the first place. And so don't use the word love. The Buddha didn't use the word love. A lot of Vipassana dry meditators, they love the word love because it's part of their.

**Speaker F:** Society.

**Speaker A:** Does that answer your question, Krishna?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank.

**Speaker D:** You.

**Speaker A:** All right, so B, are you around now? Are you here? Anicca, what do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say? I would have said I love the talk, but now I would say I like the talk. All right. And it's very— yeah, I mean, you emphasize this now, whatever practice is to be done is to be done in now. And that makes everything very simple and very clear. And now there is no need to strive, just make a small effort. And this gives me a lot of satisfaction that all I have to do is for every now moment I make a small effort and make a change, and it's so.

**Speaker C:** Easy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in the past when I was doing a lot of this Goenka method, so it was very hard because it was always about, you know, very long-term effect. And then I was, oh, now I'm meditating an hour, but would I be able to do it tomorrow as well, day after tomorrow? And it was always kind of tough. And then I would make some resolution, okay, I need to go for a retreat for 10 days to really make it stick. But it won't stick. Yes, I have to go to another retreat and another retreat.

**Speaker A:** So it was very difficult. Sticky.

**Speaker C:** Instead.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And I also realized when I was doing a lot of the striving, actually, so there are a lot of these now moments which I was just missing because my mind was always in the thought of hard work in future and also being dissatisfied that I'm not— I didn't work in the past so much, you know. I should have meditated much.

**Speaker A:** More.

**Speaker B:** And there are so many moments which were completely kind of gone in the negative, unwholesome state. But now it's very easy to see. All I have to do is just make a change now. So that's— I quite like it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and the changing is easy because it's a small thing to do. Yes. Right now. All right. So, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on a critical distinction between two approaches to spiritual practice: the Buddha's direct, joyful path and the striving, austere path of "dry" effort. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Sukkha Comes First, Not Dukkha**
*   The talk begins with a provocative question: which comes first, pleasure (*sukkha*) or displeasure (*dukkha*)?
*   The Buddha's teaching in *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination) shows that **pleasure comes first**. Dissatisfaction arises when pleasure is clung to and not relinquished.
*   This reverses the common worldly (and many spiritual) view that we must first confront and eliminate pain to find happiness.

### **Critique of Striving Through Austerity: The Jain Example**
*   The discussion uses the **Devadaha Sutta (MN 101)**, where the Buddha debates Jain ascetics (*Nigaṇṭhas*).
*   The Jains believed in burning off past *kamma* through severe austerities (*tapas*) and self-mortification, a "no pain, no gain" approach.
*   The Buddha refutes this by asking if they know what past actions caused their present suffering, or how much is left to burn. They cannot answer. He argues that if suffering itself was purifying, then sick people or prisoners would be enlightened.
*   **Key Insight:** You cannot *dukkha* your way out of *dukkha*. Suffering cannot end suffering.

### **The Translation Error: "Striving" vs. "Right Effort"**
*   A crucial point is made about translation. The Pali word for the Jains' practice is *tapas* (austerity), while the Buddha's recommended energy is *viriya* (or *padhāna*, right effort).
*   Many translators erroneously use "striving" for both, blurring the line between painful striving and the **right, joyful effort** the Buddha taught.
*   **Right Effort** (*sammā-vāyāma*) is defined as the **minimal effort needed** to:
    1.  Prevent unwholesome states.
    2.  Abandon arisen unwholesome states.
    3.  Arouse wholesome states.
    4.  Maintain and perfect wholesome states.
*   This effort is **not strenuous**; it is happy, energetic, and viral-like (*virile*), born from a mind already inclined toward joy.

### **Two Buddhist Paths: Direct/Juicy vs. Gradual/Dry**
*   The talk contrasts two paths found in Buddhism:
    1.  **The Direct, "Juicy" Path:** Starts with wisdom (*paññā*)—understanding the Four Noble Truths *right now*. From a wholesome, joyful, and satisfied mind, concentration (*samādhi*) and morality (*sīla*) arise naturally. This path is immediate, joyful, and "juicy."
    2.  **The Gradual, "Dry" Path:** The common, slow path of *sīla-samādhi-paññā* (morality, concentration, wisdom). When misunderstood, it becomes a long, striving slog. The talk specifically critiques modern "dry *vipassanā*" (e.g., Goenka, Mahasi noting) as a **mental version of Jain austerity**—trying to note or dissect *dukkha* until it disappears, which is seen as futile and painful.

### **Practical Implications & Advice**
*   **The Practice is Always in the Present:** You don't need to strive for future results or lament past practice. Freedom is possible **right now** by changing the mind state in *this* moment.
*   **Letting Go is Painless with Wisdom:** Giving something up is painful only if you still crave it. If you **see the danger** in it clearly with wisdom, craving falls away, and letting go becomes easy and natural.
*   **Avoid Dukkha, Don't Dissect It:** Using the analogy of dog feces on a path: the wise choice is to step around it (avoid *dukkha*), not to step in it ("choiceless awareness") or worse, pick it apart and analyze it ("dry insight").
*   **Cultivate Satisfaction:** The first *jhāna* and progress come not from wanting an experience, but from **being satisfied with what you have right now**. Clinging to special experiences (like past-life memories) is a trap.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a call to embrace the Buddha's direct path of joyful understanding. It warns against mistaking strenuous striving and endurance of suffering for the path. True practice is about **seeing clearly in the present moment**, dropping unwholesome states with ease, and cultivating a wholesome, satisfied, and energetic mind that naturally moves toward release. The essence is: **Don't worry, be happy. Make a small, right effort now.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching about avoiding striving and embracing a joyful, direct path. Here are the main ones:

### **1. The Chicken or the Egg / Pleasure or Displeasure**
*   **Metaphor:** The classic "chicken or the egg" riddle is used to frame the philosophical question: Which comes first, *Sukkha* (pleasure/ease) or *Dukkha* (displeasure/suffering)?
*   **Purpose:** To overturn the common assumption. The speaker argues that, according to the Buddha's teaching in *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination), pleasure comes first. Dissatisfaction (*Dukkha*) arises when we cling to or fail to relinquish that pleasure. This sets the stage for the entire talk: the path starts from a place of potential ease, not from a place of lack.

### **2. The Jain Ascetics (and Modern "Dry" Vipassana)**
*   **Story/Analogy:** The talk centers on the **Devadaha Sutta**, where the Buddha debates Jain ascetics (*Niganṭhas*). Their practice involved severe austerities (*tapa*) to "burn off" past *kamma*, believing suffering must be endured to purge suffering.
*   **Purpose:** This is the primary cautionary tale. The speaker uses the Jains as a metaphor for any spiritual path based on **striving, strain, and self-mortification**. The Buddha refutes this by asking if they know what past kamma they are burning, how much is left, etc., highlighting the futility of blind striving.

### **3. "No Pain, No Gain" & Bodybuilders**
*   **Metaphor:** The modern gym mantra **"no pain, no gain"** is directly compared to the Jain (and misguided Buddhist) approach.
*   **Story:** The speaker uses the example of bodybuilders who pain themselves to gain muscle. The "gain" is temporary (muscle that fades) and doesn't address underlying *dukkha*; they often just end up competing or, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, can't maintain it. The "pain" doesn't lead to true happiness or release.
*   **Purpose:** To show that striving and strain in spiritual practice are as misguided as in physical culture—they might produce a temporary result but not the fundamental freedom from suffering.

### **4. The Dog Dookie on the Sidewalk**
*   **Metaphor:** This is a vivid, humorous analogy for how to deal with unwholesome states (*Dukkha*).
    *   **Stepping in it:** "Choiceless awareness" – seeing suffering but not avoiding it (critiquing passive noting practices).
    *   **Dissecting and eating it:** The "Mahasi method"/dry Vipassana approach – obsessively analyzing and dwelling on the suffering.
    *   **Stepping around it:** The "Buddhist path" or "right noble effort" – seeing the suffering clearly and happily letting it go, avoiding it without struggle.
*   **Purpose:** To contrast the direct, joyful abandonment of unwholesome states with the common, laborious practices of dissecting and "working through" suffering.

### **5. The Marathon Runner**
*   **Metaphor:** A runner in a marathon who is exhausted and in pain two-thirds of the way through.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the pointlessness of **striving**. If the activity (the race, the meditation) has become a painful struggle, the wise choice is to stop. There's no inherent virtue in finishing a self-imposed struggle. True practice should not feel like a grueling marathon.

### **6. Dry vs. Juicy**
*   **Metaphor:** The speaker contrasts **"dry" Vipassana** (straining, noting, striving) with its opposite, which is **not "wet" but "juicy."**
*   **Purpose:** To encapsulate the quality of the correct path. "Juicy" implies a quality of joy, vitality, satisfaction, and ease (*Sukkha*) that naturally arises when practice is correct, as opposed to the arid, effortful, and frustrating "dry" path.

### **7. Rearview Mirror**
*   **Metaphor:** Looking in the **rearview mirror** at old conditioning and past sufferings that have been abandoned.
*   **Purpose:** To describe the joy and pleasure of an *Arahant* (or anyone on the path) who sees old, unwholesome patterns but no longer falls for them. It emphasizes that freedom is pleasurable, not a state of grim detachment.

### **Summary of Core Contrasts:**
The metaphors and stories consistently build a contrast between two perceived paths:
*   **The Striving Path (Jainism / Dry Vipassana):** Chicken/Egg -> *Dukkha* first -> No pain, no gain -> Dissecting dog dookie -> Painful marathon -> Dry.
*   **The Direct, Joyful Path (Buddha's Teaching):** Chicken/Egg -> *Sukkha* first -> Step around dog dookie -> Stop the painful marathon -> Juicy -> Rearview mirror joy.

The speaker uses these stories to argue that the Buddha's core teaching in the sutta is being mistranslated and misunderstood as "striving," when it is actually about a wise, energetic, and joyful "right effort" that abandons *Dukkha* the moment it is seen.
