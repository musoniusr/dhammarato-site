### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Me?

**Speaker B:** It was the condition.

**Speaker A:** I just started the call, I was recording it, but we can talk a little while about this. Fine. So, that the point— Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Bhante, your video, please. Huh? Can you— I can't see you.

**Speaker A:** All right, now you can. Can you see me now? Yeah. All right, sometimes Skype does that. So anyway, back to the point that yes, if you practice correctly and relax and everything is okay, then you'll go into a kind of a marvelous state. Relaxed, everything is good. And then you note that marvelous state, and then later you want it back again, right? So wanting something that you don't have now is the order of the day. Wanting something instead of saying, I don't need that special state, I can just relax anyway. Maybe it'll come, maybe it don't, but that's all right. I'm I'm cool. And then when you relax again, then it will be there. Now, if you want it and you're working really hard, then you're going to get tired. And so when you see the tiredness, you can say, aha, I see that tiredness, and I was intending to relax, so let me just relax now that I'm tired. All right, so in the way that you're speaking, you missed two opportunities to see Dukkha. The first opportunity that you missed was wanting a special state and then working hard to get it and then getting tired. And so your original question is, is that, uh, is there a point of going too much? And the And the actual answer to that is probably not. I've never heard of anybody who had too much joy. That in fact, on occasion at the end of a call, I'll make the joke of, well, I've had about as much joy as I can stand. But that brings on more joy. And so I wouldn't say then that it's possible. But who knows, there may be too much of a good thing. Yeah, pretty much a good feeling, but I haven't run across it. But the point was, is that you weren't getting too much of a good thing. You were in fact not getting a good thing because you got tired, and you got tired working for something that you wanted that you didn't get.

**Speaker B:** And also, it was I also have a feeling of fear, because— A feeling of what? A fear.

**Speaker A:** A fear?

**Speaker B:** Fear, anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Oh, anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Because this state was so marvelous, that now it's a bit dull, you see?

**Speaker A:** Well, anxiety, Fear normally comes from not wanting something, but afraid that you're not going to get it, or afraid that something will go wrong.

**Speaker B:** I think my fear is that I have the fear to get used to be in the wholesome state, you know? It's stupid, but it's the fear to be comfortable and that one day I I stop being comfortable.

**Speaker A:** All right, so then fear of not being in a wholesome state. Is Anicca already not in a wholesome state, and the fear is preventing you from getting back into the wholesome state, and this you can say, aha, I see that fear, I see that anxiety. Now, we could say then that Fear is a mental state, but it almost always gives rise to a physical state, in the sense that you can feel that fear as anxiety or as tension in the body. And if that's the case, then the correct procedure would be start focusing on and paying attention to the body while you're breathing in long and breathing out long, noticing that anxiety. And also accompanying it with the thoughts of, wow, there's no problem here, everything is going to be all right, there's no reason to have the fear. And so we start working with that anxiety at a physical level while we both use the body and the mind to bring that sensation of fear that's expressed in the terms of anxiety we can begin to say, "Hey, look at there, I can make a change to it." The anxiety actually does relax. Oh, what a relief it is to watch that anxiety melt away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I am trying to do that, but the thing is, I'm looking for result too quickly, you know, I'm looking— Right, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Instead of trusting yourself that all the anxiety will melt right away, but if we have the thought, "Oh, that anxiety won't go away," then that thought is unwholesome and is going to keep the anxiety going. But trusting yourself that you can let the anxiety melt away, that you're not going to continue to keep it on, and by being afraid that it's not going to go away is a definite way of keeping it going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Now I know that this is very subtle, it's strange for people to understand that, but the reality is, is that we then generally talk ourselves into anxiety, and we can talk ourselves back out of it, but not by having thoughts of, oh, this is long-lasting, oh, it won't go away, oh, I wish it would go away, those kind of thoughts. That are going to keep that anxiety going. By having the thoughts of, oh, let me look at that anxiety, let me play with it like it was a toy, it will go away all on its own, no problems. And taking deep breaths with that, then that anxiety will go away. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Because sometimes I wonder if it would work better to just concentrate on something else, you know?

**Speaker A:** Right, distracting ourselves, but that's exactly what we're doing. That instead of just concentrating on, or let us say focusing on, or paying attention to, "Oh, that anxiety and I don't like it." We're actually distracting ourselves from that position into, "Oh, it'll go away on its own." Oh, there's no problem. All I have to do is just to breathe and to watch, and everything's going to be okay. Now, there is another way to distract ourselves, and that is by playing a game on the cell phone, watching YouTube, writing code. But things like driving a car is not going to get rid of the anxiety. But you can distract yourself completely out of the anxiety, but it will probably come back up. So the distraction that you actually want to use would be the distraction of a complete polar opposite of it. Instead of a 90-degree turn into a game or YouTube or something, let's take the polar opposite of distraction. Into, "Oh, that anxiety doesn't mean anything." "Oh, it will go away on its own." "Everything is completely all right." So that would be the distraction that I would think had the best value.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, because the other things works, but it doesn't give you the confidence.

**Speaker A:** You know, right, it's a distraction. You don't have that. But when you recognize, then the anxiety did go away. That gives you the confidence. Yeah, it went away. I watched it dissipate. I watched it disappear. And I can let go of that anxiety and can relinquish it. Oh, what a relief it is to let go of that anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and so you can build that confidence, you know, yeah, that Anicca, that you can deal with it. And sometimes I think I'm trying to go too fast. I'm trying to get right up like that, and I say, oh, I can't. And so I look, not done, okay, it's not done.

**Speaker A:** I understand exactly, and the too fast still has the desire to it. When you can come to the realization or to the point that, oh, the job has already been done, I've seen that anxiety. Now that I've seen it, let me just relax. Yeah, the job that needed to be done was seeing it and then distracting into, oh, I can relax now.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Rather than saying, "Oh, I've seen that anxiety, now I have to get rid of it." Yeah, that's my idea. "Now I have to get rid of it." That's when we get back into the desire again, rather than, "Oh, I'm glad I saw that anxiety, now I can just relax.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I have a blind spot for the hindrance of wanting something.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. All right. Well, now that we have pointed that out, you can start looking at what do you want? What is your desire?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I must try to be more, to get more sensitive to that one. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Great. Excellent. Well, I'm glad that you called, but I think that you've gotten the point. Let's make it a short call then. Yeah, and you go practice this and then come back and tell me about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. All right, thank you very much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, have a great day.

**Speaker A:** All right, you too. You have a good day.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, this is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A, the teacher) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B, the student):

**Core Topic:** How desire and fear disrupt meditation and how to work with them skillfully.

**Key Teaching Points:**

1.  **The Trap of Craving Special States:** The student described entering a "marvelous," joyful meditative state, then later craving its return. Dhammarato identifies this **wanting** as the primary problem. The effort to regain the state led to tiredness and frustration, which are forms of *dukkha* (suffering/stress). The instruction is to let go of the desire for any particular state and simply relax; the wholesome state may then arise naturally.

2.  **The Secondary Trap of Fear:** After losing the pleasant state, the student felt **fear and anxiety**—fear of becoming attached to comfort and fear of losing it. Dhammarato explains this fear itself becomes a hindrance, preventing relaxation and the return of well-being.

3.  **Practical Method for Working with Anxiety:**
    *   **Acknowledge & Investigate:** First, see the fear/anxiety clearly: "aha, I see that anxiety."
    *   **Somatic Approach:** Notice how the mental fear manifests as physical tension in the body.
    *   **Skillful "Distraction":** Don't fight it. Gently shift attention to the breath and pair it with **soothing, opposite thoughts** like: "Everything is okay," "It will pass on its own," "I can relax with this."
    *   **Build Confidence:** By observing the anxiety dissolve through this process, you build confidence in *anicca* (impermanence) and your ability to work with the mind.

4.  **The Subtle Error of "Getting Rid Of":** Dhammarato warns against a common mistake: shifting from "I want that good state" to "I must get rid of this bad anxiety." Both are forms of desire and control. The correct attitude is: "I'm glad I saw that anxiety. Now, having seen it, I can just relax." The job is **seeing**, not eliminating.

5.  **The Root Hindrance:** The student identifies their "blind spot" as the hindrance of **desire/wanting** (*kāmachanda*). The talk concludes with the assignment to become more sensitive to this pattern of wanting in practice.

**Overall Theme:** The talk emphasizes a non-striving, relaxed awareness. Suffering arises not from the absence of pleasant states, but from our **desire** for them and **aversion** to their absence. The path is to see these mental movements (wanting, fearing) with kindness, relax the bodily tension they create, and gently guide the mind back to a balanced, undisturbed state.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Marvelous State" as a Fleeting Object of Desire**
*   The talk revolves around the experience of a special, wholesome meditative state. This state is metaphorically treated like a desirable object that one can "have," "want back," or "get used to." The problem arises when the meditator develops **craving (tanha)** for it, turning it into a source of *dukkha* (suffering/stress) when it's absent.

**2. Anxiety/Fear as a Physical Substance**
*   Fear and anxiety are described in tangible, physical terms:
    *   Something you can **"feel... as tension in the body."**
    *   A substance that can **"melt away."**
    *   Something you can **"watch... dissipate"** and **"disappear."**
    *   An object you can **"let go of"** and **"relinquish."**
    This metaphor makes the abstract emotion concrete and manageable, framing it as a temporary condition to be observed and released, not a core part of the self.

**3. Playing with Anxiety "Like a Toy"**
*   This is a key metaphorical reframing. Instead of treating anxiety as a threatening enemy to be fought, the speaker suggests approaching it with playful, curious detachment. This shifts the relationship from one of resistance to one of observation, undermining its power.

**4. Distraction as a Directional Shift**
*   The speaker uses a spatial/directional metaphor for dealing with unwholesome states:
    *   A **"90-degree turn"** into activities like games or YouTube is a less effective distraction. It avoids the issue but doesn't build confidence or address the root.
    *   The **"polar opposite of distraction"** is turning directly toward the anxiety with thoughts of "it doesn't mean anything" and "it will go away on its own." This is framed as the most skillful "distraction"—a complete reorientation of attention and attitude.

**5. The "Job" That is Already Done**
*   The process of overcoming anxiety is framed as a "job." The crucial point made is that the main work is **seeing and recognizing** the anxiety and the underlying desire. Once seen, the metaphorical "job" is complete. The mistake is adding an extra, unnecessary job: **"Now I have to get rid of it."** This reframes success from *elimination* to *awareness*.

**6. Implied Story: The Cycle of Craving and Fatigue**
*   While not a formal story, the speaker outlines a clear narrative cycle that the student is stuck in:
    1.  Experience a "marvelous state."
    2.  Crave its return.
    3.  **Work hard** to get it back (this "work" is the unskillful effort).
    4.  Become **tired** from the striving.
    5.  Miss the state and feel **anxiety/fear** about its loss.
    6.  This anxiety then **blocks a return** to the relaxed state.
    This story illustrates the Second Noble Truth (the cause of *dukkha* is craving) in a personal, practical context.

**7. Anecdotal Joke: "Too much joy"**
*   The speaker briefly mentions making a joke at the end of calls: *"Well, I've had about as much joy as I can stand."* He notes this ironic statement itself brings more joy. This short story serves to humorously challenge the very notion that there can be "too much" of a wholesome state, pointing to the student's perception as the issue, not the joy itself.

In summary, the metaphors (physical substance, toy, directional distraction, completed job) and the implied story of the craving cycle are used to make the abstract Buddhist concepts of *tanha* (craving), *dukkha* (suffering), and *anicca* (impermanence) immediately accessible and applicable to the student's direct experience of meditation and anxiety.
