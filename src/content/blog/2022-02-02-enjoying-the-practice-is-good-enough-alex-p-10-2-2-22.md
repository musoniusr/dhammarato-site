### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, should I say that again, or are we okay

**Speaker B:** starting now? Okay, say it again.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Dan, Dan Goldfield, he gave me this really great narrative to show me what it— you could give me a picture of what it's like to really enjoy this practice, because I noticed that it was turning into something to do, and it's important to me that I'm enjoying it, because that's the whole show. Because if it's something to do, it turns into a burden. Right, so he gave me this little, this awesome, beautiful narrative of this, like, Alex of Sparta atop of a hill, his hand tightly gripping the axe, and then he waits patiently and quietly, and then all of a sudden he sees a figure. Ah, it's Dukkha emerging from the fog before him. He throws his axe with all his might and sees the axe spiral back into his hand. And he's satisfied with his throw. And so I've been doing that, and what I've noticed is that it sometimes gets to a point where it's like— like right now what happens is, I guess the only good way to say it is like the juice or like the buzz that that was giving me is like, is like it's subdued now. It's less juicy, it's less buzzy. It's, it's so everything got like that.

**Speaker B:** That's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So I just, the thing is though, what's really interesting is even though that's like that, I'm still enjoying, I'm still feeling success, I'm still feeling satisfied. Yeah, but I don't want to say but, and what I'd really like to

**Speaker B:** do,

**Speaker A:** what I'd really like to do is keep up that enjoyment of it, to continue to enjoy. And I mean, the point he made to me is like, it's about creating that ingenuity, which is being creative. Innovative. So I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on that for me,

**Speaker B:** ways I could— the whole show. Let's review it in several respects. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** All right. All right.

**Speaker A:** But just so much success today. So much like congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Like congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Like I went to work today, Dhammarato. I want you to know I went to work today and I said I'm going to make friends. That's what I did today. I wasn't working. I was making friends. Every person I called was like, hey, John, how's it going?

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So that's exactly right. Yeah. On several occasions, I've told people that when you go to work, your only job there is to make friends with the people. That's the only job that anybody actually has. That's the job.

**Speaker A:** That's it. And everything else falls into place from there.

**Speaker B:** Everything else falls right into place or falls apart if you're not doing it. If you think that the work is reason that you go to work and that work becomes really important to you, your life is going to be miserable and everybody else's life is going to be miserable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that's that point. All right. Let's look at this from that, from the perspective of what the Buddha is actually teaching here, because that image of throwing that axe at the Dukkha and that, and the thrill of the chase and the finding and the grabbing and the striking and the return of the axe and all of that can be put down into that one little phrase that the Buddha said, "Aha, I see you." Dukkha. That's— but you're drawing that analogy out. Now, there's also— there's more aspects to it than that. And that is, is that let us say I'm drawing now out of old Mahasi Sayadaw literature, which is different than the Mahasi practice of Western Buddhism. Okay. But the old original is where Mahayana points out that whatever object of meditation that you're taking, we do it by seizing, grabbing, falling upon, or confronting the object of meditation, which is not at all what's taught in Western Buddhism. What in Western Buddhism is taught is a noting method. But the noting method really doesn't have any skin in the game. Even the breathing that they teach is just noting breathing rather than seizing the breath, taking control of the breath, having some skin in this game. Okay. And so this analogy that you're using is actually marvelous because it shows that you're actually putting right effort into it. You're putting skin in the game. You're seizing that object. And in this case, the object is the axe that you're slinging at the Dukkha. And so I really want to congratulate you for this. Now, yes, exactly. This is exactly Dharma, that what Danny did. And I really trust Danny. He knows the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** I mean, he knows his shit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he does. He does. I know. I watched him grow through it. Yeah, sometimes stomp around in it.

**Speaker A:** He told me. Which is funny, we still haven't gotten around to that. He keeps telling me to ask you about his struggle stories, the times when he was in the ditch, but we always talk about something else.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, there's also another student that I'll tell you about that has something slightly different than that, because I taught— this guy's name is Ben, and he has really received great value from the story that is the Buddha teaching in Sutta 19. And the name of the sutta is Two Kinds of Thoughts, where the Buddha— I think that I've already told you this story about the cowherd that is taking the cows out of the shed and having to take them to the village. Okay. Ben and I went off on the tangent of Rawhide. You know, the song and the TV— the song actually is out of a TV series, and that the movie The Blues Brothers made that song very famous again and popular. But it was an old song out of the— you know, it's round them up, head them up, herd them out, move them on, rawhide.

**Speaker A:** I've never heard it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you can go— I'm sure it's got dozens of copies on YouTube.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so the whole idea in this song is, is that there is a bullwhip making cracking sounds to crack those bulls or crack those cows to get them in line. Okay. And so Ben picked up on that whole idea of cracking his whip. Getting the mind going. And guess what? That's exactly what you're talking about here. Exactly. Same story. Exactly. It's the effort and the energy and the joy that we have that we put into that to say, yeah, we can do this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so congratulations with that. Now there's another point, and that is, is that the initial bringing up of that joyful, gleeful, energy that is based upon the success and the feeling of success of, "I've got this!" OK, that I can sing Rawhide right out loud, you know, I can crack that whip, I can throw that axe, I can do it! This whole— and it's a kind of an awakening, an awakening to the power that you actually have had within that you didn't even know that was there before. Yeah, so, yeah, so this is also in the Pali, very, very well known and very clearly stated out, but most people read right through it. They don't have this exhilaration of the feelings of it. But this is what the word Piti is actually all about, is the thrill of the chase, right? Rather than the oppression of having to be burdened down by a practice or a thought system or whatever like that. No, it is actually a joyful, exhilarating, enthusiastic, we got to go, we got to go do this. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is like that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. So and then you also mentioned that that too kind of subsides. Yeah. Right. Okay. Well, this is exactly the analogy that's being drawn, that after the cowherd gets those cows out to the pasture, where they're operating wholesomely. Now the cowherd can relax in that sensation of, well, I could do this. That cracking of the whip, that throwing of the axe, you don't have to keep throwing it all the time, but when we need to, we can throw it. And we have that. So now we could just relax. So we're actually doing this in the Pali. We're talking about relaxing from Piti into Piti Sukkha. And into Sukkha, which is now the predominant feeling, is the feeling of satisfaction and release and relax. But we do need that really heaping pile of satisfaction that's built into it. OK, that you're experiencing with the throw of that axe or the cracking of the whip or the Back home. Oh, that feels so good. You could do it with the breath, but whatever we're talking about, it's back to that Anapanasati point about seizing the object. So you're mentally seizing that axe. Ben is seizing that whip. Yeah, it has that kind of gesture to it. You put some skin.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sometimes I go around my house and I do this. And I wait for it to come back. I'm like, I'm chopping onions today, and in the middle of it, I just get up and through the kitchen, and my girlfriend's washing dishes. She turns around and I'm like this. She's laughing at me. She's like, your energy, oh my God, it's contagious.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. Now, this is the part of Anapanasati practice that you cannot get from a book. This is the kind of Anapanasati practice that the people who are writing books don't put in there, that is actually expressed as intellectual information. It's a good point, but it has to be given out experientially. Okay. And so this is an important quality. Now, in Western mentality of what meditation is, it's all very quietly not moving a muscle, sitting in a meditation hall for many, many hours.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you see how this practice of Anapanasati is exactly opposite to that in many ways.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This one is actually putting some skin in the game. Yeah. But we get started with that quiet time of beginning to figure out what the mind is doing. But then when we get it rolling, that's when we can bring out the axe. That's when we can bring out the bullwhip.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, so let me ask you this. So what's happening now is like that thrill has kind of subdued, it's subsided, but also— or, and also when I throw that axe now, um, It's almost as if— it's almost as if it's— yeah, it's almost as if I— that axe, the satisfaction that comes from seeing that axe strike that Dukkha is not coming from that anymore. There's that. And then also the Dukkha is

**Speaker B:** less

**Speaker A:** of a thing to be struck at, if that makes sense. It's like, I don't know what— my axe is like just going through things. That's what it feels like now. So it's starting to feel kind of like pointless in a way.

**Speaker B:** Ah, well, now we can relax because we recognize that the skin in the game and the energy in the game that we put into this to figure out that that target is really illusionary. Before, it was real. The Dukkha was real. The ordinary mind really does feel bad. Okay, people, you do suffer when the Dukkha is real. That's what we actually mean by it, is that it is in fact dissatisfaction itself. And now when you have these, um, experiences of being able to deal with that Dukkha, you're gonna do really nothing to it. And there we get an even grander sense of relief. Wow, there was really nothing to it at all.

**Speaker A:** It's okay, that sounds awesome. And it's weird, it like the thought comes up, could that— could I really 'Could that really be me? Could that really be where I'm at right now?' Like, that's like, it doesn't sound— you're

**Speaker B:** already at a stage of meditation that many meditators take 20 years to get to. And in fact, you struggled for a long time in that way, and it would have taken you 20 years or more to have gotten out of it what you've gotten out of this in the past 6 weeks or so. That's the speed of the Dharma when it's practiced correctly.

**Speaker A:** So what about like the whole thing of, you know, like we're practicing the skill of building the house of cards, right? So I'm practicing the skill of hacking away at the Dukkha, I guess you could say, right?

**Speaker B:** So, well, I guess now you're beginning to see the Dukkha is that it's merely nothing but a house of cards. There's nothing to it, and you're beginning to see that. That's what you said. That's what this is about, that this is just— when we say a pile of shit, really, when we say it's a pile of shit, uh, we're talking about lies. The real way of looking at it is, hey, there's nothing here, there's nothing to it. But when we call it a big pile of shit, then we have the feeling that this is a load of shit, which means it's something that I've got to carry around as a load. Now you're beginning to recognize, hey, I can handle this easily enough. It's not just a pile. I mean, it's not a big pile of shit. It's just really nothing here, just a thought. That's all it was. That's the only existence it has, is the existence of a thought. Yeah, but when we, when we thought that we were the thought, then we have that thought, feeling, doing, uh, over and over complex. That's the Samsara, is when we own the thought. Now this is the thought as that's just another thought, and we can actually throw an axe at it. You are not that thought.

**Speaker A:** So if, if I'm so Here, the only thing that I don't want to do is I don't want to, like, I don't want to take my hands off the lever and then lose my Sukkha or lose the Piti.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** You know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** So like, you just relax and stay on guard.

**Speaker A:** Relax and stay on guard. Okay. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, relax and keep watching. Yeah, the, uh, the cowherd is sitting under the tree. He's keeping an eye on those guys. He's watching. Yeah, right. Where's that Dukkha?

**Speaker A:** I can drink my— I can drink, you know, a warrior— I can drink my warm glass of mead, my warm mug of mead, and watch the sunset and watch the sunrise. But as soon as I see Dukkha,

**Speaker B:** yeah, I got it. Yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Okay. Wow. This is fucking nuts. I'm really surprised.

**Speaker B:** Yes. In the beginning, we got to whack a lot of cows. In the beginning, we got to throw a lot of axes. But when we get good at it and get joyful at it, then it's okay that we're throwing axes. But then we begin to recognize, hey, wait a minute, I don't have to throw axes at that one. Hey, wait a minute. This one's okay. Hey, wait a minute, things are looking good. So we keep watching, but now we're seeing wholesome rather than seeing unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** So what about this? Because this is like, this is something that keeps coming up, the thought of— oh man, just sometimes I just forget. Sometimes I just don't even remember the thoughts, the unwholesome thoughts. But it was something like, well, basically

**Speaker B:** that's what the Buddha tries to teach is forget about them.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what it was.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't matter. It's gone. You didn't suffer anymore. That's gone. I don't care anymore.

**Speaker A:** That's it. Okay.

**Speaker B:** But there are kinds of thoughts that keep recurring. It will come back again. And all you need to do again is forget all about it again. Whack it with your axe and off you go, and you don't have to do that.

**Speaker A:** So is it that after I've relaxed for a little bit and I see Dukkha, you know, and it's been a while and I see Dukkha emerging and I throw the axe, is that when the thrill comes back because it's been a while and I'm conserving the energy for something that is actually necessary?

**Speaker B:** Or the answer to that is, it's up to you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, all right, all right, it's up to you.

**Speaker B:** But so long as you're having great joy in that whipping, that kachunga, or that crack, or in your case throwing that ax, okay, so long as you're enjoying doing that, keep doing it. And when we say, oh, I don't even have to do that now, I can throw that Dukkha out, or I can see that cow from a distance and just say, hey, mentally. You don't have to throw the axe. You could just say, ah, I see you.

**Speaker A:** This is the thought, because it keeps coming up, is I just want to make sure that I just want to make sure that I can really just relax because I don't want to put myself at a disadvantage where I let go and then I forget, I forget the thrill and the joy of throwing the axe. I don't want that to happen. So is that Dukkha right there? That I need to throw the axe at that right there? Or is this a good observation that we should talk about?

**Speaker B:** Okay, let's talk about it because it can be either way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. So the term that I'm going to open up this topic with is the term of whataboutism. What about? Okay. That's actually what you're saying is, is that if I do relax, what if things go bad?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** That's a whataboutism.

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right, right, right.

**Speaker B:** That's just more Dukkha to throw your axe at is your whatabout thoughts. What about if this goes bad? What about if that happens? I mean, this is so common that it's— the psychologists know all about it. Now it's even making it into the news. And the way that it's made it into the news is the way that the Republicans are doing it. Any time that you accuse them as a group or an individual within that group, their only possible response is, yeah, but what about them over there? What about this? OK, so we say that Trump's a crook. We can say, well, what about Joe Biden? And, you know, and that's their only throw, is this whataboutism. Is that strong in our culture now when it's really strong in an individual's mind? It actually has a medical label to it. That medical label is OCD, or obsessive compulsive disorder. And that, that stuff happens from, well, what if my hands are dirty? Or what if the kitchen is dirty? Or what if the doors are not locked? In other words, we're always looking for things that are dangerous and we're trying to make things safe. And so the person who has OCD, one of the examples will be the person goes around from window to window all over the house, checking to make sure that it's locked. And when they get all the windows checked, they'll sit down and rest for a minute or two, and then they'll think, oh, well, what if I didn't check one of them right? And so they go around and check all the windows again to make sure that they're locked. Okay, this is what we mean by obsessive compulsive. Is that we are compelled to go do something, and we are obsessed by the fact that something could go wrong. And so we invent and make up, what if this happens, what if that happens, what if— and in fact, many companies are actually successfully built on that, while all the employees in that company are stark raving mad with all the things that could go wrong. That's what it is about whataboutism. All right. Something's wrong here. We got to go fix it. And so here you are. And we've actually talked about this in another level, is that you've got to have permission to be successful because that whataboutism is going to come back as, well, if you feel this good, what if something happens bad now? All right, so throw your axe at that thought too.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's just the— it's just marvelous

**Speaker B:** that we can talk about this stuff and then you begin to see it immediately.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the only thing I'm going to say here, and then, you know, if there's nothing else you got to say to it, I'm just putting it to rest. Is that it's— there's still like that lack of joy or that lack of thrill in throwing it now. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** Maybe that's already in the past, because just then when you saw that whataboutism in your mind, you joyfully threw that axe just now. You're right. Let's be at the now now, not yesterday's now, not this morning's now, or yes, you know, let's be in now nows. And right now it is joyful to throw that out. Caught it.

**Speaker A:** Hey, you know what? What might be happening? It's interesting because I think an argument is happening in my head of like, no, that's not enjoyable. That's not enjoyable anymore. But I feel like it is enjoyable. It's like both at the same time, or I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes you're not good enough is one of the messages that you're having inside. The message is that this is not good enough yet. You gotta keep looking at it, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay, right.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is good enough. Yeah, this is, this is good enough. This is it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's good enough. Okay, nothing's going wrong. Everything is okay. You don't have to do any whataboutisms. And in fact, we need to be on guard for those thoughts because those are the kind of thoughts that are going to pull you out of your good feelings.

**Speaker A:** So I just want to be clear, is it possible for like the image or the analogy that I'm working with to get stale? Or like, as long as I have the same spirit, right?

**Speaker B:** When you call it stale, it will be stale. If you can see, aha, I see you stale.

**Speaker A:** I know, and I saw that one too, but sometimes it still feels Uh-huh. Like, it traps me.

**Speaker B:** All right, so this is the point then. You begin now, or you're at the stage of recognizing how often these kind of thoughts keep coming back and coming back and coming back and coming back. That's why we need to be on guard for them, is because you have been having those kind of thoughts on a moment-by-moment basis for years. That's your natural sort of default thought process. But now your default process is, aha, I see you. But it needs to be exercised. It needs to be skillfully done over and over and over again, because those thoughts are going to keep coming back over and over and over again. Those what-ifs— what if this goes wrong? What if I become dissatisfied? Well, you're not dissatisfied right now, but you're starting to talk yourself into being dissatisfied. Okay, so while you're in that state of satisfaction, which is the point that we're making, while you're in that state of satisfaction, now you have to develop the skill of staying in there by keeping the mind on guard for these kind of thoughts, these whataboutisms, these, oh, I'm not good enough, or the kind of thought, well, I feel so good now. I'm sure that disaster is riding around the corner waiting for me. Disaster knows that I'm feeling good and he's going to teach me a lesson.

**Speaker A:** I guess I'm just— the only fear that's there is what if I lose the thrill or the joy of it and then the practice becomes There it is again.

**Speaker B:** There it is.

**Speaker A:** I know, I see it. I saw it when I was saying it.

**Speaker B:** I did.

**Speaker A:** I saw it when I was saying it. I just— I can't speak without— like, it's impossible for me to actually speak without sharing a thought of Dukkha's that I would axe at.

**Speaker B:** So, exactly. So now that you're knowing that, uh, keep that thrill going by that guarding. And take that joy and that pleasure and that Sukkha and that Piti every time that you see those unwholesome thoughts of 'I might fail' or 'this is not good enough' or 'when the thrill is gone.' That's another one. In fact, you can start this kind of don't-do list, and one of the items on the don't-do list is 'the thrill is gone.' And when you say, 'Oh, I'm having the thrill is gone feeling,' Oh, this real will go, aha, I see you too.

**Speaker A:** You're right. I mean, I guess if you could personify that, it's like, it's like some kind of like evil mercenary that's trying to like convince you, right, and brainwash you that this isn't gonna work or something.

**Speaker B:** It's like, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like a movie person.

**Speaker B:** It was probably your daddy when you were knee-high. And you learned that from him.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or a mommy, or an aunt, or an uncle, or a school teacher. But you were taught that, and you bought it big time, and you've been repeating that story ever since. And now it's time to change your story. And so you can personify it. In fact, you might be able to remember actually being told that sometime in the past. I know that I got that I'm not good enough from my dad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I got that from my dad too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, in one way, just being able to keep up with him. He would— okay, he was an Anagami, Anapanasati, His anatomy was different than mine. My anatomy is my mother's anatomy. My dad's anatomy was that he weighed— he had a 32-inch waist. He weighed about 160 pounds. He was not as tall as I am, but he was active. And his job actually was that he was a meter reader. And I'm talking about not in today's guise where The worst kind of meter reading there is, is a guy driving a truck around town. And as soon as his UPS or whatever, not UPS, his Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever connection that they have with the meter, they just read it while he's driving through the truck. He doesn't have to get out of the truck and go to the yard. OK, my dad was in the position that he didn't go out in the truck. He walked and he was a meter reader, and he went from meter to meter to meter to meter walking. And now here I'm a young kid trying to keep up with him and his profession. He's a professional walker and I can't keep up. And I keep hearing in my head over and over again, come on, hurry up. I can't keep up with him. Guess what? I carried that around for my whole life. And now one of the other words he used was lazy. If I don't cut the grass when he wants me to cut the grass, then I'm lazy. Okay, now I relish in slow down, you move too fast. I relish it. Wow, isn't it so wonderful I can be lazy?

**Speaker A:** Oh hell yeah,

**Speaker B:** dude, you'll find my dad was right. I am lazy. Thank you, Daddy. But for years I not handle that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think the truth is we're all lazier than we'd like to. We're all lazier than we let ourselves be.

**Speaker B:** Actually, I would say that we will not allow ourselves the laziness that we deserve.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I was thinking. You said it better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we do not allow ourselves to be as lazy as we ought to be. Yeah, I mean, wherever the dogs are, they're probably laying down right now. When they want to get out and go out into the yard and run around and find the other dogs and bark, they could do that just fine. But humans have to be doing that all the time because our culture tells us to be. I mean, look at that. How much food do you eat in a day? In other words, if you had the absolute bare minimum expenses, because you didn't have expenses for working. You didn't have to have anything other than toys. You could actually live for $200 or $300 a month if you really practiced on it and knew what you were doing and gained great joy in living cheaply. But most homeless people don't know how to do that. And so they are homeless miserably rather than finding— and so the whole idea then is, is that if you could in fact support yourself by working 1 or 2 hours a day, why is the standard 40 hours a week at a base minimum? And if you're going to be successful, you got to put in between 80 and 120 hours a week. Why is that? Why can't we be successful at 1 or 2 hours a day? Why don't we be successful by only working when we want to work, and when we don't want to work, we don't? Most people are working when they don't want to work. That's why we call it work.

**Speaker A:** I feel like most things, I mean, I'm sure obviously there'd be like a restructuring, right, of our world. But I think maybe a lot of the things that we get done and do well and function well as a group, we won't have anymore. You know, who's gonna, how are we gonna get our medications if the pharmacy is not open 8 hours a day?

**Speaker B:** How are we gonna get— The pharmacy can be open, but the promise lives in the pharmacy. And he only has to deal with people when they come into their pharmacy, and otherwise he's hanging out. Oh no, that's not true. He can't live in the pharmacy. That's against the law. And so look at all of the protection that he has to have and, uh, to protect his pharmacy. I mean, look how much security that he and his, uh, pet Wolverine wouldn't have to pay for any of that if he was in his home, in his house, and his house was the pharmacy. Okay, so shophouses are very common in Asia, and so when there's nobody in the store, the people are at home. And when somebody comes into the store, now the store is a store.

**Speaker A:** So what about the whole thing of like people don't like their work, you know, they don't like mixing their work with their home environment?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what a bag of culture that is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, it certainly— they

**Speaker B:** want you to work at work and not work at home because your home will distract you from the work. And my answer to that is, duh. Who is it that wants you to work so hard? The guy who's making money off of your work and your skills. That's who wants you to keep working and keep working and keep working so he can get fatter and richer and fatter and richer and he doesn't have to do anything. The smart one, you're the dumb one for working for him. And then you say, well, I'm supposed to. That's how things are. You're supposed to go get a job. For centuries, nobody in Thailand ever went to get a job. They just stayed at home and found something to do, and now they call it a farm. Or a local store. And so we can have a very easy lifestyle if we would change our culture. But we can't change the culture, but we can change ourselves. We can change the individual. Yeah, you begin to check out and recognize that, hey, I am not a slave to this society and have to work the way that I am told to work., but in fact I can begin to enjoy my life instead. And if you're best friends with the boss, he's not going to fire you even if you're the least productive employee in the factory.

**Speaker A:** That's

**Speaker B:** right, that's right, that's right. And a lot of people don't realize that, that, hey, the guy who has to do the least work is the

**Speaker A:** teacher's pet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So with these mentalities, we can begin to see that, yeah, it really is okay for me to be lazy, working wisely. Another example of that is, is that a good boss is so good at being a boss that he's got no work to do, that the only thing that a boss has to do is to try to fix what he thinks is broken about somebody, employee. The work is not good enough, this, that, and the other thing. You know, all the things that bosses do. But if the boss only saw his job, the only job I've got as a boss is just to be friends with my employees. Guess what? Now he's got nothing to do because there's no thinking, there's nothing broken. Getting along and the work gets done.

**Speaker A:** I know, that's really nice.

**Speaker B:** Without a lot of effort in it.

**Speaker A:** That's why I think I'd have a lot of fun being a manager. It's just that you get more responsibility, you know, more hours.

**Speaker B:** That's the problem with being a boss in a chain of bosses, is that the boss that you've got doesn't want you to be that kind of boss because he doesn't know what it's like. The whole issue is exactly the issue of work from home. We're starting a revolution. Computers themselves did not cause the revolution of working from home. It was the coronavirus.

**Speaker A:** That's what did it. Yep. And I think a huge part of it too, we've developed a greater acceptance for that laziness. That we ought to give ourselves.

**Speaker B:** And

**Speaker A:** then people are choosing to work from home now, even though we can all go back to work. It's like no one talks about it. It's just like, it just like happened, you know.

**Speaker B:** They're not talking about this so much anymore, but starting in especially July, August, and then September was a big one. To where a whole lot of people are now going back to work after COVID and then quitting their job again. And so you have a mass exodus of workers who are saying, hey, I can do better than this, that I got along with COVID for a year without working. I'm coming back to work and I'm really beginning to see what's going on here. And people are quitting their jobs by the millions.

**Speaker A:** Wow, are they really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, by the millions people are quitting their jobs. Wow. Huh. That's where the labor shortage is coming from, is people don't want to go back to

**Speaker A:** work. That's

**Speaker B:** amazing. That's part of the cultural revolution that's happening. And I'm standing here from Thailand watching the show and just applauding.

**Speaker A:** Yay, team!

**Speaker B:** Quit your jobs. You're not like that. Wow. Dharma dudes, come hang out and enjoy your lives and stop working so hard.

**Speaker A:** But if all these people are quitting their jobs, what are they going to do? Do they want to just create their own work?

**Speaker B:** They will find a way, and many of them will find a way with a whole bunch of what-ifs in their mind. And other people will just be throwing their axes happily at those. What about isms, and you just did another what about

**Speaker A:** ism. Well, it's not directly— it's not personally

**Speaker B:** toward me, but yeah, exactly. That's the whole point, though, is that that's where everybody is. They're afraid what will happen of me if I don't have a job, because in our culture we're taught that if you don't work, you don't eat. What will happen at the polls when 40, 60, maybe 80, maybe 20, 100, 120 million people who have quit their jobs are now voting? Who are they going to vote for? Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Why do you say it has to do with voting?

**Speaker B:** Because it will be— you see, a lot of our cultural norms are codified into law. Now that the multicultural norms are shifting, the laws are going to have to keep up with that. But the politicians' whole idea is to keep things the way that they are, and things are actually changing. So people are going to have to, if they're wanting the government to change— in other words, I forgot his name, but one of the guys ran for president said that he would give everybody, no matter what income that they had, everyone gets $1,000 a month.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that'd be great.

**Speaker B:** If everyone got $1,000 a month, almost nobody would have to work. The only people that would have to work would be the ones who do want more money than that. Well, let them go run the society, and everybody who is happy on $1,000 a month can be in Sangha instead. We also have the issue of AI coming up. They say, and I believe that it will happen, the question is, will it happen in 5 years or will it happen in 10 years? But people will, in 10 years from now, perhaps commercially, 5 years from now, there will be no truck drivers' jobs.

**Speaker A:** None.

**Speaker B:** Really? There will be no truck drivers on any roads anywhere in the world. Wow. Why? Because the trucks are out there driving themselves. Wow. They're actually now experimenting with trains driving themselves. If you had very small trains who could actually change the track movement so that the train itself, rather than having to have a stationmaster to pull those levers while the train goes by, It's a trap. If the train can control all the tracks, then you could have little trains going all over the place with all the tracks that we've got.

**Speaker A:** You know, this is so amazing because like there is so much attachment to your job as having to do with your identity, you know, so much attachment and meaning and significance that goes into that. For people. I know there was for me for a long time, and there still is, but very much less than there ever was before. But some people, man, like, their whole life, their whole world is their job. So it's no wonder that we have this, you know, we still have this pressure, this culture of, you know, get to work, you know, get a good paying job. But when we have AI doing everything, There's not going to be any reason to do anything.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Well, the question is, who owns the AI? Who owns the process of production?

**Speaker A:** That'll be the government, probably.

**Speaker B:** Well, as so long as it is— let us say, use the example of General Motors with unions— they are going to be staying very, very behind in their technology. Because the unions and the corporations are having contracts that have to be renegotiated, but it's still this kind of situation between the businesses and the— like GM and Ford and whatnot. Or you look at Tesla, who was saying, "We only want human beings to do what our machines can't do." We only want machine, or we only want humans around when we can't get a machine. That's why Elon Musk is going into robotics big time, because if he could do self-driving automobiles, that's nothing but a robot on wheels. You take the wheels off it and put it in a humanoid shape, and now you've got that same AI that can run the factory. Or at least put parts on widgets that can't be done by a bigger machine stamped into place automatically. You can have a robot do it. Wow. So almost all of the Tesla cars are being made primarily by robots. The humans are there as engineers doing the things, making the robots. Exactly. But now they even have a factory in, uh, uh, I think it's in New York, uh, in Buffalo, New York, where they have a factory of robots and their output is making robots. Robots making robots.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that's nuts.

**Speaker B:** No, it is just what's happening. What's nuts is people saying, what about me when all of that stuff gets into gear? If you have the idea of Whippy, we've got AI, let everybody— I mean, I can and finally I can just relax.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's great.

**Speaker B:** That's amazing. Mm-hmm. But most people are going to be terrified. What about me? I don't have a job. There's that whataboutism. So we're going to have to have probably one or maybe two generations of whataboutism while we go through AI. But yeah, there's going to be already that way that you've heard about machine or mechanized farming. In the old days, 100 years ago, everybody had their own small farm, but those have been collected together, right? My grandfather was a farmer. Wow. Uncles were farmers. Everybody was into dabbling in farming. My grandmother grew the food. We grow our own food right here in the garden. Not all of it, but chilies and tomatoes and bananas, coconuts, pineapples, all that kind of stuff, just right here. And you go get it. That's awesome. So the point then is that because the farms have been collected, that means that it once took 90% of the population to feed 100% of the population. Already now it's less than 3% of the population in the United States is feeding 100% of the population. And we're going in that direction because of the bigger, the bigger the farms. And now the farmers that own the corporations that own the farm, all they want is one guy to come into the shed to turn the computers on in the morning. And all of the farm equipment is already mechanized. Each one of them has its own GPS that knows exactly where to go farm. It has satellite so that they can see where this part of the farm or this part of the patch of land, part of the plow field, needs more fertilizer than the others. And so these machines, as they're going through the field, will over-fertilize the area that needs fertilization. They'll put water where water is needed, etc., like that, and do even better farming. Meanwhile, other machines will go and pick the strawberries strawberries so humans don't have to do it. They've already got really excellent strawberry-picking machines built because of COVID We don't need the labor now because we've got machines that can pick strawberries. Before, strawberries were very delicate, very difficult to pick. To figure out which strawberries could be picked is a very, very intelligent operation to be a strawberry picker. And they didn't have them. So they've developed AI equipment to do that. Is this strawberry worth picking right now? And not only that, but now the computers can remember each individual strawberry as it's being

**Speaker A:** developed. So what about all the starving children in the

**Speaker B:** world? The people who are starving, the starving children in the world, there's two— there actually, there's a triple gem, or not a gem, a triple thing that is happening there is called the Second Noble Truth: greed, ill will, and ignorance. The issue is that we do waste more than 30% of the food. We would rather throw it in the bin. And I'm talking about we grocery stores would rather throw the stuff in the bin than to just take it down to which may even be cheaper to do is just take it down and put it on one of the local street corners in the town. Wow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Or like a local donor or something, like a donor, like a donor truck or something like a food drive area.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. And so if grocery stores started giving away all of the stuff that they did throw out, and what do they throw out? Well, things got timestamps on it. You can't sell it beyond a sell-by date, but they could give it away. That's not against the law. Instead, they dump it. There is actually on YouTube, I've seen recently, the harrowing experience of places like Amazon that when all of the Christmas returns, they're just dumping it. It's too much difficult to restock. They'll just take the loss and dump the returns. They could give them away. They could put it back on, uh, uh, the website saying free goodies

**Speaker A:** here. Now they probably know this. That's my thinking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they don't want to do it.

**Speaker A:** It's— it's— this is where laziness becomes a— becomes a problem.

**Speaker B:** This is not— no, it's— this is not laziness. This is greed. If they put that stuff out on the street corner and people just come to get it, that means that the people who came to get it won't be going to the grocery store to buy it. And so they would rather throw out the old stuff so that people come and get the new stuff so that they stay profitable. If they throw out the old stuff, then people won't go and buy the new stuff, and so they'll have to throw the new stuff out as old again. And so they can see I'm just in the business of giving away my food is their mentality.

**Speaker A:** So how could they stay profitable then if they did that, if they ended up just giving away?

**Speaker B:** Why do they have to stay profitable?

**Speaker A:** Well, I guess they don't. But if it's a business, you know, they want to make money.

**Speaker B:** Well, they want to make money because of the way that our system is set up. Yeah, it's capitalist. Why do we have to have a capitalist society? Why can't we have store owners that are in it for— I mean, the house he lived in is no bigger than anybody else's house in town. Why should the store owner have to have a great big house to live in? The same way with doctors. And here's a really interesting one. In Thailand, they have a national system set up that has both for the nursing schools and the medical schools, that anyone who qualifies, who wants to go to medical school, can either pay his way through and do it the normal way, with these government schools anyway, so they're not high, or he can sign a contract with the government that the government will pay his education, give him a living, give him quarters, he gets his medical education, and after that, he goes to do a 10-year internship a 10-year internship where he is paid to be a doctor in a hospital. After his internship of 10 years, he's free to go be a medical doctor anywhere he wants to. But many of them will stay right there in the hospital they're already in. We don't have anything like that in the US. No. In fact, the medical profession itself wants to keep medical doctors at a premium. They want to keep only a few of them around. So that they could all the ones who were in the club make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

**Speaker A:** Oh, man, that's sick.

**Speaker B:** All they'd need to do is just build more medical schools, let kids go to school and become medical doctors, and then we would have all the medical doctors we need because people like it. There's a lot of hypochondriacs that want to be medical doctors.

**Speaker A:** You know, I was wondering, actually, If doctors, if they— I don't know if you know this— if doctors get a commission off of each medication that they

**Speaker B:** prescribe to a patient, then they will prescribe more medication than the patient actually needs.

**Speaker A:** Do they get a commission? Do you know? I was curious about that. They get a commission?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Not only that, but they get so many other perks. One student told me that at one time recently he went into a doctor's office, a medical doctor's office with his— I think he was taking care of his mother or something like that. And in this room, the doctor's office himself, not a— let us say not a visiting room, but the actual office that he spends his time in. He has an entire collection of coffee mugs from the pharmaceutical companies that he represents. The pharmaceutical representatives really go in after those doctors. You got to sell my pills, got to sell my pills, you got to sell my pills, and here's your commission for it. It's a big-time, well-known business in the United States. Medications are so expensive in the US because there's a big, big deal between the doctors and the pharmaceutical companies and the hospitals, they're all in a huge mafia.

**Speaker A:** Oh my God, man, that's nuts. That is so nuts.

**Speaker B:** And it went that way. You see, in 1970, hospitals were hospitals, but during the Reagan administration, every hospital became a business.

**Speaker A:** I remember you telling me that.

**Speaker B:** Yep. So hospitals are not business. Hospitals are no longer hospitals. Well, the local hospital here in Thailand is the government hospitals, but in the United States, every hospital, especially the Catholic ones, are money-making

**Speaker A:** businesses. It's funny, it's the invisible sales

**Speaker B:** game.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the invisible part of it is, oh, you're sick, you need a doctor.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're sick.

**Speaker B:** You're not sick, you're just making yourself sick with your thoughts. Right, exactly. And look at how many of the medications are actually for that. I mean, every painkiller, all of the oxycodone, anything that's got oxy in its name, all of it is done because, uh, people don't take care of their own mental problems correctly by having wise thoughts. They go to the medical doctor who is going to charlatanize them into taking a bunch of pills.

**Speaker A:** That's nuts, man. I mean, we actually don't even know for real, like, what the truth truth is, if these pills actually have any, like, evident indicators of actually working, of, of actually helping people with their thoughts, helping people with their minds. We don't really know. It could all be one giant placebo effect. If it's this easy, and by easy, I mean that— By the way, Dhamma

**Speaker B:** is nothing but placebo. Exactly right. Sorry about that. But yeah, it's a placebo. But if we wisely operate correctly with placebos, we get maximum benefit out of the

**Speaker A:** placebo.

**Speaker B:** Now, generally, the placebos are operating at about 20 to 28%, but there has been actual research done that they can drive that up into the 40s. And here's the way that you could do that. If you're doing the blind study to where the people who don't know either the caregivers or the patients Both of them are blind to who gets what medication, but the setting is all the same. And the setting now is a hospital. The setting is that this patient is sick and they're in a hospital bed and they're getting an IV. And this IV has this magical new potion that they're testing. And there in a hospital setting where you've got heart monitors, you've got doctors coming in, everybody's really happy about testing this new medicine. The placebo goes up to about 45%. Because everybody thinks they're getting that new pill and that new pill is working because look how much effort the hospital is putting into it. But if you just give them a bottle of pills and take it home and then later you fill out an application or a survey, how well did this pill do? The placebo rate goes down to about 30%, 20%. Okay. So it has to do with the amount of effort of the skin in the game that the placebo user is

**Speaker A:** getting. So, well, just out of like, I'm just because out of eagerness and curiosity, what happens now? Like after I, you know, as I start to relax and still be on guard, What? Like, I mean, yeah, I'll just enjoy relaxing and being on guard, but is there anything else? Is there anything else in the path?

**Speaker B:** Well, why would you ask? That sounds like another

**Speaker A:** whataboutism. Okay, I asked because I know there's something more in the path.

**Speaker B:** There's got to be more than that. There's got to be, but OK, let us say for the piano student who is practicing Ravel and Debussy, and he's asking, is there more to the piano than Ravel and Debussy? The answer is yes, there is Chopin, there is Beethoven, and there is Tchaikovsky. But let's play the music that you could play. And when you get good at playing the music that you can play, we'll give you a little more difficult pieces to play as your skills develop. Okay, but if you're unsatisfied with Ravel and Debussy, did you want to improve? You'll never be able to play Chopin. You'll never play that revolutionary attitude if you can't play Claire de Lune.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. So is excitement a form of

**Speaker B:** dissatisfaction? Both.

**Speaker A:** And wanting more? Because I just noticed, like, I was going to tell you, well, I'm just excited. I'm just excited to know more, like, to know more about the path. But I realized, well, yes, but that

**Speaker B:** indicates that I want something very, very well. But it also has the quality of, "I can do this."

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's it. "Let me at it." Yeah, that too. Exactly. Thanks.

**Speaker B:** There is that as well. That's the Piti. That's the pity that we have as the feeling of excitement, enthusiasm, that in fact now though, we're enthusiastic about something very wholesome, as opposed to being enthusiastic about something that's unwholesome. Yeah, okay. I have seen smokers enthusiastically looking for their cigarette.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, but now we're being enthusiastic literally for the Dharma. Guess what? The enthusiasm for the Dharma is actually one of the knowledges Sotapanna is enthusiastic, enthusiastic to learn what's in the mind, to be enthusiastic about all of this stuff. That yeah, we could do this, we could figure this out, we got this wired. Enthusiasm is not only just, is it okay or not? No, it is an essential ingredient to the correct practice of the Dharma. This is in fact part of the skin in the game, with cracking that whip and using the arm, the mental arm, to do it. Exactly. Throwing that axe. Exactly. Yeah, that's it. That yes feeling. That's it. Okay, that's the enthusiasm, and it is the essential part of the path. So long as the enthusiasm is wholesome, it will do you well. When the enthusiasm is for unwholesome stuff you're going to have a whole lot of 'about-isms' going on. Alex, I got to tell you, I'm so proud of you. Congratulations for really, really getting it. That's so great.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** You're getting it. You're coming along. You got it. Thank you. You've got something now. You know that you can throw that axe. You know that you can do it enthusiastically and that you can enjoy doing this, knowing that there is more later, that there is even a deeper level of satisfaction. But you got to have this enthusiasm for practice.

**Speaker A:** You're right. You're right. I'll just enjoy this right now.

**Speaker B:** This is good enough. This is good enough. It is good enough.

**Speaker A:** This is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, this really is good enough.

**Speaker A:** This really is good enough. Good enough. If I— and if I have this for just, you know, another moment, another moment, another moment— this is good enough.

**Speaker B:** This is it. Yeah, that's the development of Sukkha, the actual satisfaction. This really is good enough.

**Speaker A:** This really is good enough. It's like good enough. It really is, especially comparatively, you know, to the past, like just even to yesterday. Oh wow, okay. This is good enough. I could either think about wanting something more or wish I had something better, or look at what I have now and be like, man, this is good enough.

**Speaker B:** This is good enough.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to shut my mouth. I'm not going to jinx it.

**Speaker B:** This is good enough. Actually, that— I'm not going to jinx it. That can either be a wholesome or an unwholesome thought. Depending upon whether you might jinx it when you think I'll jinx it. I know, I just noticed that. Aha, I see that too.

**Speaker A:** I know, I noticed it. I noticed it. I was like, well, the only one jinxing here is me. So there's no, you know, there's no neighbor over there trying to jinx me.

**Speaker B:** Like, right, exactly, exactly. Then in fact, the only thing, way that I can jinx myself is by having thoughts I might jinx myself. Exactly. So let's go ahead and end this conversation. I gotta end it with, I am so pleased about it. This is really, really great. Danny needs to see this video if he has

**Speaker A:** time. I'm so pleased too, Dhammarato. Thank you so much. You and, you and Dan have been so very helpful to me, really. And I want to say, like I told Dan today, as much as I don't want to cling to a permanence of being, man, I got this now, I'm not going back. At the same time, there is a real sense of me just putting my foot down and be like, no, I'm not going back. This is it. I have chosen. I've chosen to literally navigate and walk upon a new world. That is what has happened. I'm literally navigating through and walking upon a new world, and I've created it for myself, and it's not going anywhere. Congratulations. Yeah, really, congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Pat myself on the

**Speaker A:** back. All right, Dhammarato, thank you so much. I'll talk to you soon.

**Speaker B:** See you.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on a student's (Speaker A) experience with a powerful meditation metaphor and his subsequent questions about maintaining joy in practice. Dhammarato (Speaker B) guides him through understanding the natural evolution of meditative joy and how to skillfully work with the mind.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Metaphor & Initial Experience**
The student shares a vivid narrative given to him by a friend, Dan: imagining himself as a Spartan warrior on a hill, waiting to spot "Dukkha" (suffering/stress) emerge from the fog and joyfully throwing an axe at it. This metaphor helped him shift his practice from a burdensome "task" to an **enjoyable, energetic engagement**. He experienced a "buzz" or "juice" from this active, seizing approach.

### **The Evolution of Joy & The "Subsiding" Phase**
The student reports that the intense thrill or "buzz" has naturally **subsided**. While he still feels successful and satisfied, he worries about losing the joyful edge and the practice becoming stale or pointless.

### **Dhammarato's Teachings & Explanations**

1.  **Validation & The "Skin in the Game" Approach:** Dhammarato enthusiastically validates this approach. He contrasts it with passive "noting" practices, praising the **active effort and "skin in the game"**—seizing the object (the breath, the axe, the whip) with energy and intention. This is the essence of right effort.

2.  **The Natural Arc of *Piti* (Rapture) and *Sukkha* (Happiness):** He explains this subsiding is a natural and positive progression in meditation.
    *   The initial thrill is ***Piti***—the exhilarating "joy of the chase," the enthusiasm of "I can do this!"
    *   As one gains mastery, this naturally relaxes into a deeper, more peaceful ***Sukkha***—a **satisfied, contented happiness**. The warrior can now relax under the tree, watchfully guarding, only throwing the axe when necessary. The need for constant, high-energy effort diminishes.

3.  **Seeing Through the Illusion:** The feeling of the axe going "through" Dukkha or it being "less of a thing" is a sign of progress. It means the practitioner is seeing that **Dukkha is often just a thought, an illusion**, not a solid reality. This leads to a "grander sense of relief."

4.  **The Persistent Enemy: "Whataboutism":** Dhammarato identifies the student's main obstacle as **"whataboutism"**—the mind's obsessive, fearful questions: "What if I lose the joy?" "What if it becomes a burden again?" He links this to cultural conditioning and even OCD. The instruction is clear: **recognize these thoughts as the primary Dukkha to target now.** "Aha, I see you." Throw the axe at the "whatabout" thought itself.

5.  **"This is Good Enough" – The Antidote to Seeking:** A major theme is learning to **settle into the current stage of satisfaction**. The student's desire for "more on the path" is seen as another subtle form of dissatisfaction. Dhammarato repeatedly emphasizes, **"This is good enough,"** encouraging the student to relish the present level of Sukkha without the mind undermining it with stories of lack or future fear.

6.  **Application to Daily Life:** The talk begins and ends with applying this joyful, engaged attitude to life. The student shares how he went to work with the sole intention of "making friends," which transformed his experience. Dhammarato affirms this, stating that **relationship and joyful engagement are the true point of any activity**, not the burdensome concept of "work."

### **Conclusion & Encouragement**
The student has a breakthrough, realizing he is navigating a "new world" of his own creation through this practice. Dhammarato offers profound congratulations, noting that the student has reached a stage of understanding that some meditators take decades to find. The final note is to **enjoy the current satisfaction, maintain enthusiastic but wise guard, and continue to see through the mind's compulsive stories.**

**In essence, the talk is a guide to moving from the strenuous, joyful effort of initial insight (*Piti*) into a relaxed, abiding contentment (*Sukkha*), while skillfully using that same energetic awareness to cut down the mind's persistent habits of worry, seeking, and self-sabotage ("whataboutism").**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key metaphors and stories used in the talk:

### **Core Metaphors & Stories:**

1.  **The Warrior (Alex of Sparta) Throwing an Axe at Dukkha:**
    *   **Source:** Given by Dan Goldfield to Speaker A.
    *   **Description:** A warrior stands atop a hill, axe in hand, waiting patiently. He sees "Dukkha" (suffering/discontent) emerge from the fog, throws his axe with all his might, watches it spiral back to his hand, and feels satisfaction.
    *   **Purpose:** To represent the **active, energetic, and joyful engagement** in meditation/practice. It's about confronting negative mental states ("Dukkha") directly and skillfully, with a sense of power and satisfaction. It contrasts with passive, burdensome practice.

2.  **The Cowherd and the Bullwhip ("Rawhide"):**
    *   **Source:** Drawn from a student named Ben and connected to a sutta (Two Kinds of Thoughts). Referenced via the song "Rawhide."
    *   **Description:** The practice is likened to a cowherd energetically cracking a whip to herd cows (the mind) and get them moving in the right direction.
    *   **Purpose:** Similar to the axe metaphor, it emphasizes **applying effort, energy, and "skin in the game"** to guide the mind. It's about seizing control and actively directing mental energy with gusto.

3.  **Building (or Seeing Through) a "House of Cards":**
    *   **Description:** Practice is initially like skillfully building a house of cards. Later, insight reveals that Dukkha itself is **like a house of cards**—insubstantial, with nothing solid to it.
    *   **Purpose:** Illustrates the progression from developing skill to realizing the empty, illusory nature of the problems we face. It shifts from construction to deconstruction.

4.  **Relaxing on Guard / The Watchful Cowherd:**
    *   **Description:** After the initial energetic work (throwing axes, cracking whips), one can relax under a tree like a cowherd, keeping a watchful eye on the pasture. You enjoy your mead (satisfaction), but remain vigilant to spot "Dukkha" if it appears.
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the next stage: **tranquil vigilance**. The intense effort gives way to a relaxed, sustained awareness where you can enjoy peace but are ready to act if needed.

### **Supporting Analogies & Concepts:**

*   **"Skin in the Game":** Repeated phrase emphasizing **personal investment and direct effort** in practice, as opposed to detached, intellectual noting.
*   **"The Thrill of the Chase" (Piti):** The exhilarating feeling (identified as the Pali term *piti*) of engaging in the practice, the enthusiasm and joy of the pursuit itself.
*   **"Whataboutism" / The "What if..." Monster:**
    *   **Description:** Framed as a mercenary, brainwasher, or internalized critical voice (often from parents, e.g., "you're lazy," "you're not good enough").
    *   **Purpose:** Personifies the **obsessive, fearful thoughts** that undermine satisfaction (e.g., "What if I lose the joy?" "What if this isn't good enough?"). These are themselves targets for the "axe."
*   **"Aha, I See You":** The core, simple recognition from the Buddha's teachings. It's the essential moment of mindfulness that all the metaphors point toward—**clearly seeing a mental state for what it is**.
*   **Placebo Effect:** Used to describe the Dhamma itself. The key is not whether it's "objectively real," but how **skillfully and wholeheartedly you engage with it** to produce beneficial results.
*   **Musical Analogy (Ravel, Debussy, Chopin):** Practice is like learning progressively more complex pieces of music. You must master the current "piece" (level of understanding/satisfaction) before moving on, instead of being dissatisfied with where you are.

### **Narrative Arc of the Metaphors:**

The conversation traces a **developmental path** using these metaphors:
1.  **Energetic Engagement:** Start with the "axe" or "whip"—active, joyful confrontation with suffering.
2.  **Joyful Satisfaction (*Piti*):** Experience the thrill and success of the practice.
3.  **Tranquil Abiding (*Sukkha*):** The intensity naturally subsides into a relaxed, watchful satisfaction ("good enough").
4.  **Vigilant Protection:** Use the now-refined skill to guard against the "whataboutism" and fearful thoughts that threaten that peace, applying the "axe" only as needed.

The central theme is that genuine practice is not passive or burdensome, but a dynamic, creative, and sometimes joyful process of actively working with the mind.
