### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Marcus, you had mentioned the Anapanasati Sutta. Where shall we begin with that? I'll give you the first shot at it. What's your question?

**Speaker B:** Well, so it starts talking about mindfulness of breathing. The first thing it talks about is, you know, the long breath and the short breath and discerning whether one is breathing long or short. So I guess the first question for me is I've definitely practiced the long breathing, but I wondered like, what is sort of the utility or purpose of the short breathing? Or are they like somewhat different indications for each of those?

**Speaker A:** Both of them are conscious and both of them are controlled breathing, intentionally so. And that you can say that the long breath is more relaxing and more of the show, and occasionally the short breath has some extraordinarily good value. One of them would— times with the short breath would be when the mind is drowsy or when it's racing or when you're in not such a good state. Of any kind, then you could use the short breath because when you're doing the short breath, you don't have much time to have a pity party or to have misery thoughts. That the short breath actually takes the time to keep the mind focused on the breathing in, out, in, out. In, out, like that. It's also an energizing breath. It's not a shallow breath because it's short, that's short in duration. Okay, but it's short intensely, like panting when you're running up a hill and you get out of breath. The body will go into that kind of breathing on its own. And then we try to stop it from doing that. We don't like that breath. We call it catching the breath when you can stop it from pounding, you know, in, out, in, out, heaving for air. All right, that's the short breath. And that we can practice that to get the same benefits, that it is in fact life-saving. It will wake you up. —vibrantly alive, energized. But we don't stay on it for a long time. We would go back to the long breath. Now this was understood and well known in the Anapanasati Sutta. He's got a whole lot of ground to cover. And so it doesn't go into those kinds of details, but it does list them as separate kinds of breathing, with the understanding of the third step of Anapanasati, which is understanding and knowing the body. And in here is the first time that the phrase "thus one trains oneself" which I translate into these are skills to be developed. That from time to time you've already been doing long breathing, and from time to time you've been already doing short breathing. The stuff happens naturally as well as intentionally. But understanding the body is something that a little child has way too much of. When we're learning to walk, we fall down and we don't like it and we cry and all of that kind of stuff. And pretty soon, especially by the time we get to be teenagers, the body is dirty and ugly and all of that kind of stuff, or at least it needs to be trained in sports so that it can do what we hope it'll do. And so we lose track of being in the body as a friend. And so what Step 3 is, is to really get in touch with the body, find where your tensions are, find where your pains are, uh, get in touch with them, learn to work with them, be happy with them, so that we now are getting ready to do Step 4, which is also a training is to actually relax, to become completely passive, at ease with ourselves. And we're going to do that, guess what, with all four aspects of the Satipatthana. Isn't that interesting? The whole point of, let us say, unifying And then liberating the mind is basically a kind of relaxation. That we liberate it from all of the rules and all the shoulds and all of the goals and all the judgments, make it liberated, which is kind of a relaxed state of the mind. Then we also learn to do that with the feelings by learning the conditioning qualities of the feelings. And know that the mind conditions the feelings and the feelings condition the mind. And so now we've actually talked about those parts of the Anapanasati that work together at the end, where the mind's relaxed, the feelings are relaxed, the body's relaxed, and therefore the contents of the mind are all relaxed. And in that case, the relaxation is the relinquishment, just let it all go. Or in some cases in the U.S., they call it let it all hang out. So in this way, the Anapanasati practice is quite integrated, and it's handy enough to think of the body in these various characteristics of what's called the Satipatthana. But that, the Satipatthana, the four foundations, actually go way back into history of humans, that we saw things as solid, we saw things as liquid, we saw things as fire, we saw things as gases and airs and smokes and clouds and all of that kind of stuff. And so it's quite natural for the Buddha then to take those four natural elements that are on the outside, because that's what everybody is doing. We are taught from childhood, probably from very primitive times, to pay attention to outside things. The Buddha comes along and says, "No, we're going to start paying attention to the inside too." And so that's where the Anapanasati is, is that it's doing it on the inside, and that in the Satipatthana Sutta it says both internally and externally, and so we practice it both ways, but we're often not paying much attention to the outside. We pay attention to the inside, so we start paying attention to the inside as practitioners, but then sometimes we get too enamored with that and we have to recognize, no, there's a balance here. We've got to get them to where we're paying attention to both the inside and the outside. And so, this in fact is what we could say in the half-sutta where Ananda asked the Buddha, saying that Shariputra told me that half of the Dharma is friendship, and the Buddha says, "No, it's the whole thing." First we become friends on the inside, then we friends on the outside. And we become friends on the inside with what's on the inside, warts and all. And then we become friends on the outside with what's on the outside, warts and all. That's the secret, is to accept ourselves the way that we are, because then we can look at the way things are right now and have choices about it. If we don't want to be that kind of person, then whenever it comes up, we don't want to look at it. Oh no, that's not there. I'm not that person. And so this is actually the practice then, is to learn to be friends with both the inside and the outside. And that the key ingredient on that, by the way, is the part about gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, which also fits in with so many of the other suttas about changing the thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts. So don't have unwholesome thoughts about your warts. Have wholesome thoughts of, "Oh yeah, I saw the mind wander away. Oh yeah, I see myself getting stuck in hating that old person, judging him." And so, this is the context, and you ask first off about the short breath. Sometimes we get end of that hatred, and we need that short breath. Just to get it out of our mind, whatever it is, it's really strongly stuck in there, doing short breathing will, for at least during the time of the short breathing, put an end to those thoughts. One thing that we can begin to talk about is the beginning of the sutta, of how profound it is that this sutta was announced in advance, and then the word spread so that it had a huge, huge audience. Did you remember reading that part of the sutta?

**Speaker B:** I haven't gotten to all of it.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I haven't gotten to all of it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Well, this is at the very beginning, and most people read things from the beginning to the end. But not all the time.

**Speaker B:** Not always.

**Speaker A:** And so the beginning of the sutra talks about it in the way that this is going to be auspicious. And that it talks about the various teachers. This is where we can find where all of the good teachers are and how many students they have with each one of them. They all gather together. And then the Buddha talks about what kind of people they're here talking about— the nobles. Then he talks about people doing Vipassana meditation— or no, sorry, not that, Metta meditations, and some people practicing Jhanas, and he wants them to listen to him about Anapanasati because it is of great fruit and great benefit. And basically what we can glean from that is a lot of people came to the Buddha continuing to practice what they had already been practicing. And the Buddha wants them to change that and start practicing differently with Anapanasati. The way that these other practices were done generally have some downfalls to them. That one of the things about the Jhanas and the Metta meditation folks is that they do have the removal of the hindrances. They have to get those hindrances out of the mind. And so in that regard, these guys were already practicing that part of it correctly because that's a major issue. And it seems like here in Western Buddhism, getting the mind free from the hindrances is not a big deal at all. Just note, just note, or just watch, or just be choicelessly aware of all of that garbage that you've got there. This is where we learn that, oh no, within the practice of the Buddha here in the Anapanasati Sutta, as well as some of the other suttas, getting the hindrances out of the mind is of an importance. And that we can use the body, we can use the feelings, we can use the states of mind we have, and the examinations of the mind, etc., in order to remove the hindrances, because how we feel right now, and how we experience the body right now, and what the mind is, the states that the mind is in right now, is the way to be free from those hindrances. By paying attention to what's going on right now, rather than thinking about someplace else, some other time, which is what we normally do. And we can think of that kind of stuff as conceptual thought. And so we now will look at conceptualizing thought as potentially, if not already downright, hindering us from being in a good state. But being happy-go-lucky and everything is okay right now is the easy way out of all of the problems of life. And that the interesting part is, is that various places sprinkled throughout the Anapanasati Sutta are elements that are known to be the elements of the first jhana and how to get them. As also the Eightfold Noble Path, that the Eightfold Noble Path and Anapanasati and the first jhana are all mixed together right there in the first jhana if you know what you're looking for. By gladdening the mind, we become free from the hindrances By bringing on Sukkha and then Piti, these are Jhana factors of the first Jhana, and then applying this over and over again and training ourselves into the Sukkha, training ourselves into gladdening the mind. This is the applied and sustained thought of the first Jhana, and then the additional ingredient is the relaxation of the body. So with the body relaxed, we feel energized and safe, secure, satisfied, and then we feel successful. That's the first Jhana factors, and that's all that's built into the practice of Anapanasati in order for as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa puts it, getting the mind fit for work. Getting the mind fit for work would mean taking the training harnesses off, or taking the burdens off, throwing the burdens down, to get ready for doing something that we need to do, which is take a really good look at what's going on. Now the interesting part about that is, is that if we have the hindrances at bay, if the hindrances are away, if the unwholesome thoughts are down, then that means that what we're going to be paying attention to has twofold quality. One is that it's real, and number two is that it's wholesome. And so this is what we're going to do with the rest of the Anapanasati. Once we get the body, the feelings, and mental states ready to go. Now we're going to be start watching the flow, the flux, the Anicca, watching the cycles. This, you know, the starts and the middles and the ends of things that are happening fast or slow and up and down and whatever like that. Because normally the mind is in, caught in a cycle, in the cycle not liking how the cycle is going either now or dreading how it's about to go. But with wisdom, we can understand these cycles by stepping back from them. The experience of watching a Ferris wheel go around is a whole lot different from sitting in a box and not knowing what's happening, which is how most people live their lives. Then it goes up and down and it starts and it wiggles and then they're all terrified and it just goes around. But if they know that they're on a Ferris wheel, then life is a whole lot easier. And so this is how we use Anapanasati in order to gain the freedom to actually let things go, to let the mind be liberated, to let the feelings be soft and gentle, Sukkha. Or even Upekkha, and let the body be relaxed. So this is the actual end of the Anapanasati, which we're actually talking about step 4, step 8, step 13, and step 16— step 12 and step 16, the top ends of each one of these things. That in fact, if you look at it from the point of the Satipatthana, step 1 and 2 of Anapanasati very much coincide with step 5 and 6, and also step 9 and 10, that they come in pairs like that. So you have sort of the beginner and then the middle of it in that way. And so it all kind of fits together, but the danger is, is that but because it's introduced in the order of the Satipatthana, people think that that's the actual order that it should be practiced, which is not the case. And in fact, we can take guidance from the Eightfold Noble Path from that, because that's actually what we're intending to do, that we, by doing Anapanasati, we fulfill both the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and also the Eightfold Noble Path. That's what we mean by the fulfillment of the Eightfold Noble Path is actually the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. The Sambhojana is the factors of enlightenment to where the Eightfold Noble Path is the method or the skills that you need. So in the beginning we're on the path and then the path itself item by item becomes the factor of the enlightenment, of the awakening. And so that's how the sutta is laid out, that the sutta is of great fruit. The Anapanasati, which you use the word mindfulness, normally we go back to Anapanasati because Sati has a different quality than we normally think of as mindfulness. Basically, Sati is to wake up, to come back to the immediate moment. That is hard to watch your breath if you don't remember to watch your breath. So remembering to be here now, remembering to watch the breath, that's what we really mean by Sati. And yet it's been translated commonly as mindfulness. And I'm not even sure what mindfulness is because I never heard of the word until you get it in Buddhism. So it's kind of a manufactured or made-up word. And in fact, I would think that mindfulness would have the quality of looking or investigating anyway. So Sati would be remembering to be mindful. And so, the mindfulness, or the Sati, and right investigation, and then right effort, can be seen right there in the beginning, several places in the Anapanasati Anapanasati Sutta. The number one place it is found is at step 9 and step 10, when you investigate the mind and then gladden the mind. Those two steps are closely embedded there, but we can also see that that applies to the breath also, in the sense of remembering to take a deep breath and then taking the deep breath and taking the effort to do it, and then experiencing that deep breath. So this is also a way of looking at each of the steps of Anapanasati through the lens of the Eightfold Noble Path. And then with the fourth item of the Eightfold Noble Path, as we remember, wake up to seeing what's going on and then making the change, and we do that over and over and over and over again, time after time, getting into a new habit of it, that begins to build up the actual kind of a feeling of, "I can do this, I can remember to do this, and it feels good, I like it and it feels good and comfortable." and I can do this. And that's where we actually then will bring on that deeper satisfaction and the deeper relaxation, is the feeling that, yes, we can do this. And it also brings on a kind of a wow feeling of success. And that's where the Piti comes in, that feeling of success. That we get by being able to practice getting the mind free from hindrances over and over and over again, rather than letting the mind go wild. So that's the basic introduction to Anapanasati. Do you have any questions about this?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, so, so step 3, step 3 is, you know, concerning the body in terms of noticing what's going on in the body, any tensions, things like that, and relaxing those.

**Speaker A:** So yes, that's where, by the way, this is where Goenka retreat center system ends. Is step 3. They keep doing body scanning and body scanning and body scanning and they can't get out of it. And it's also systematic. In the sutta, you notice that it doesn't say anything about it having to be systematic, but whether that we experience it. And the way to do that is in other suttas found under the title One by One as They Occur. Whatever is happening to to the body, pay attention to that. Something new comes up, look at it. Be there for anything that happens, and when it does, you got it. To where many people practice the scanning method, they already know their knees are hurting, but they can't look at their knees, and so they keep going around like this and say, oh, I don't want to— my knees, no, no, no, no, go down and down. You know, like that. To where in the Anapanasati sutra it has the quality of being comfortable. So don't put your body in a state where it's uncomfortable because then you've got to pay attention to your discomfort, because if you're uncomfortable, you're unsatisfied, and the whole practice is to get the mind satisfied again. And so that's about the step 3, is that whatever is happening in the body that's going to get you dissatisfied, immediately pay attention to that. Don't put it off while you're doing something else and eventually get down to it. That's the systematic approach.

**Speaker B:** So should one kind of be aware of the whole body as they breathe? In that step, or can one like.

**Speaker A:** Work from place to place? Don't set a bunch of great big high quality unreachable goals for yourself. That's the big danger of doing it that way, is that you set goals of how it's supposed to be like when you do it right. Okay, and judging yourself like that's not the right way to do it. The right way to do it is to just one by one as they occur, pay attention to them, and let that skill grow that way. Okay, well, setting goals— because the goal settings then is going to make you feel bad because you can't make up with the goals that you set. The answer here is always, let's stop with the goal setting because the goal setting causes unwholesome thoughts. Let's keep the thoughts wholesome. Let's keep the thoughts to the point of that whatever goals there were to be met, I just met it. I just met all the goals, any goal that needed to be done, I just did it. I've gotten the job well done, and now I can relax with the job well done. Remembering that the job is already done is hard work for these Western people. Hard to remember that the job has already been done, that there's nothing to do except relax and celebrate that the job is finished. What was the job to do? Getting the hindrances out of the mind, getting those rules out. And getting any thoughts of not liking. And so there's a whole long list of things like that. Like sometimes students can hear their heartbeat, they want to know all about it, and then it comes down to they don't like it. Ah, now that you don't like it, that's the issue, is whether you like it or not, not whether you can hear your heartbeat or not. How about facial tension? Well, it has not to do with whether you've got face tension or not, is how do you like it. Are you dissatisfied with it? There's your Dukkha right there. So whatever you're dissatisfied— and setting a rule or a goal for yourself, like I'm supposed to be able to do this with the body and I can't do it yet— that's dissatisfaction, instead of being very happy with the way that you're doing it right now.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** No need to body scan, just enjoy watching the body. Be there with it, whatever it has to say, pay attention.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so another thing I wanted to talk about is in terms of thoughts. So there's obviously sort of the verbal thoughts or the mental talk, but I was wondering in terms of like, you know, we have some sort of images in our mind generally like we have some sort of image of the body in terms of like where the parts of our body are and stuff like that. So do we eventually like also try to like stop that kind of fabrication or that kind of thought? Actually, we change it.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't say that there's a goal, other than whenever you're thinking about something that's not here, right now. So, watching how your hand moves and be at marvel of how the hand is actually able to move like that, and I'm not even thinking about the hand moving, but I can watch it as it moves around. That's being in the here-now, that's quite wholesome. Experience the new body through the internal proprioceptive system is a marvelous thing to do. Remembering the argument you had with Aunt Susie yesterday, not so much. Okay.

**Speaker B:** I guess we sort of use the input from the proprioceptive system to form sort of an image of the body, and sometimes it can contribute to tension.

**Speaker A:** If you do make mental images, which means visualizations of the proprioceptive system, there's no law against doing that. But be aware that that's what you're doing. And then you can take that mental image that you're making, make it shine, make it golden, make it anything you want to do. So long as you know that that's what you are doing, to take control over things, to recognize that you do create your own reality. The body as the body, the way that the body is, is often different from the way that people think of their bodies. And the body that they actually live with is the body that they think that they've got, rather than the one that actually exist in reality, sometimes with great surprises. And so yeah, the reality is, let's see how close to reality we can be, knowing that reality in and of itself is quite magnificent, is quite profoundly beautiful. Depending upon the way that we look at it, of course, because we create the beauty. But paying attention to reality is much closer. Let us say it this way: that the further away a person is from reality, the more likely they are to experience Dukkha. The closer to reality that you have, when you perceive the way things really are, because you're looking for things the way that they really are, rather than through the lens of instincts, tribalism, confirmation bias, prejudice, any of that kind of stuff, that means then that we're far away from reality and that we're more than likely going to either experience Dukkha or cause someone else to experience Dukkha, more than likely both. But when we're really friendly, that means that we're willing to accept reality actually the way that it is. It's good enough, warts and all. Yeah, I don't really have a very high-class view of human beings because I accept them warts and all. And wow, humans are covered with little warts. Then in fact, a wart— the word wart is probably a good word for the translation of the word asava in Pali, which is also translated as cankers. And sometimes you can think of them as pimples, warts, moles, ingrown toenails, hairs, all of that kind of stuff that the body keeps coming up with. And we need to clean that stuff right out of the mind on a regular basis. And this is what Anapanasati is actually for doing, is to let's go in there and gladden the mind, take a look at what's going on, and throw that stuff out, and come into some happy state. Some state where we can be satisfied and safe and secure, comfortable. And that's built right there into the Anapanasati Sutta. But if you don't know what you're looking for, you won't see that stuff. We're talking about now step 5, 6, 7, and 8, the Vedana, that you can actually talk yourself into with step 10 of gladdening the mind. You can talk yourself into feeling safe and secure, especially if the body is already in reality safe and secure. Safe and secure and comfortable body, safe and secure comfortable thoughts, and pretty soon we have safe and secure comfortable feelings. Not so hard to do, huh? Just have to keep repeating it over and over and over again. So, you got more questions?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the steps 5, 6, and ... So steps 5 and 6 would correspond to the Pali words, I forgot what they were.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Piti.

**Speaker B:** Sukkha. Piti and Sukkha, right? So Sukkha is the.

**Speaker A:** Number 6. Actually the word Piti Sukkha is a common phrase in the Pali. And in this case, they're breaking it out, I guess, in order to make up for— but they're often used together as one word, Piti-Sukkha. But the Piti quality of it has to do with that hot damn bang, wow, got it kind of feeling, an experience of championship. And Sukkha is just the actual opposite of Dukkha. Which is being satisfied. Safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. Because if you're not safe, you've got Dukkha. If you're not secure, you've got Dukkha. If you're not comfortable, you've got Dukkha. So if you can get those three things, then Sukkha, or satisfaction, is all we need. And we can talk ourselves into.

**Speaker B:** That too. And so 8 is basically about.

**Speaker A:** Calming the feelings, or— sorry, what about calming.

**Speaker B:** Feelings? So is the number 8 about.

**Speaker A:** Like calming feelings, or— actually, It uses the word conditioners, and what it's talking about is the interrelationship between the body, the feelings, and the mind, which we've already been talking about. So we calm the conditioners, which means that we calm the causes, which calms the effects, and it kind of gets everything sort of calmed down. That way. But we have to experience those things. You see how the mind conditions the body and how the body conditions the feelings, how the feelings condition the mind, etc., like that. They're all three of them interrelated with each other. If you feel sick— actually, sorry, if the body is sick, then we normally feel sick. We don't have to if we can break that conditioning so that the body is sick. Yeah, hot dog, the body is sick. I don't have to do anything. I can just lay here in bed and just feel wonderful. So that's all there is to it, is calming the bodily conditioners. So you got.

**Speaker B:** Another question? Yeah, perhaps one more. So in terms of, in terms of the mechanics of breathing, I've noticed that one of the issues I tend to have is like the habitual tensions that the body has. For example, I tend to have quite a bit in the neck. I've noticed that whenever I breathe in, there's like a very habitual sort of tensing of certain muscles when I do that, and I'm having a bit of trouble like uncoupling that, or like training myself to breathe in a.

**Speaker A:** Different way. Okay, well, it will take a few new muscles. I mean, most people say that they do it too strong for too long a period of time, and then they get tired. Okay, look for a long, gentle, enjoyable breath, one that does not tire you out or cause the body to, let us say, do chest exercises beyond its capacity. And guess what? You keep doing this and pretty soon you can walk, you can do it longer and easier. Because the muscles are actually developing in a way that they never had developed when you're breathing shallowly. That's one of the reasons why people do not like the runner's breath, where the body is heaving in and out, is because those muscles are not used to doing that and they don't like it. But you can train yourself for doing that. People who do deep diving and swimming and all kinds of things like that are trained They train their muscles, and so they can handle things. There's a secret too, and that is, there's others like tuba players, or those great big majestic horns that they have in the Tibetan system. And the Aborigines have a didgeridoo, and all of those big machines help help get that muscle flowing, going kind of thing. And so yeah, doing some exercises with your lungs is good, but if you get to the point of not liking it, look at that and recognize that you're doing this for pleasure, not for punishment. And it is a training to get to understand the body. And the body's gonna make some changes. So does that answer.

**Speaker B:** That question? Yeah, I guess. So basically the goal is to be— well, I mean, not the goal, but the purpose is being gentle with the breath rather than like Like, because I noticed that like especially when I started with the deep breathing, there's been sort of this element of forcefulness to it because it's like something I'm unused to. And then sometimes I've felt like, well, when I'm sort of being relaxed, like I'd noticed that my breath would tend to get shallow, and then I would take a.

**Speaker A:** Breath. Right, and we're going to keep it full, but not forced. Not let it go.

**Speaker B:** Shallow. Yeah, yeah, that's the part I've had some difficulty.

**Speaker A:** With. No, it's not hard, just play with it. Experiment, watch what's going on. All of them feelings that you're having are optional. Recognize that you don't have to feel bad. This is a toy to play with. Remember the teaching of the Buddha is good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end. So don't force it. Or have bad feelings about it, because it's the right way to practice.

**Speaker B:** Is easy. I've noticed it sort of depends on posture, like in some postures it's easier to breathe in a relaxed way.

**Speaker A:** Deeply. Yes, like, so experiment with that, find a good posture for yourself. Generally sitting upright is good, bent over not.

**Speaker B:** So much. Yeah, I've noticed like when reclined it's like it's more difficult to breathe deeply, or like at least to do so in a relaxed way, versus— whereas when I'm upright it's like, it's like sort of the in-breath happens naturally in a relaxed way. Whereas in some other positions, it's felt sort of like I have to work to.

**Speaker A:** Do that. All right, well, notice the difference and notice the fact that the feeling of it being work is just a mental attitude that you have, and that you can change your posture, you can change the situation, and you can change the way that you feel because you can change your attitude. That's ultimately what we're doing. Is changing your attitude about what.

**Speaker B:** We'Re.

**Speaker A:** Doing. All right, well, uh, I'll play around with.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right, Marga, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Later. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student, Marcus (Speaker B), is a detailed and practical exploration of the **Anapanasati Sutta (Mindfulness of Breathing)**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Anapanasati as an Integrated Path**
The talk presents Anapanasati not just as a breath meditation technique, but as a complete system that integrates the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana)** and the **Eightfold Noble Path**. Its ultimate purpose is to cultivate a relaxed, liberated, and wholesome mind fit for insight.

### **Key Discussion Points:**

1.  **Long vs. Short Breath:**
    *   **Long Breath:** Primarily used for **relaxation** and calming.
    *   **Short Breath:** Has specific utilities: it's **energizing**, helps with drowsiness, and can **stop proliferating thoughts** (like a "pity party") by demanding intense focus. It's a tool to wake up the mind, not to be sustained for long periods.

2.  **The 16 Steps as Skills, Not a Linear Checklist:**
    *   The steps are **skills to be developed**, not a rigid sequence to follow in order.
    *   The ultimate aim across all four sections (Body, Feelings, Mind, Dhammas) is **relaxation and relinquishment**—letting go of burdens, judgments, and goals.

3.  **Step 3: Experiencing the Whole Body:**
    *   This step is about befriending the body, finding tensions, and learning to work with them happily.
    *   **Critique of "Systematic" Scanning:** Dhammarato cautions against rigid body scanning (like in Goenka's system), which can create goal-oriented stress. Instead, he advocates paying attention **"one by one as they occur"**—relaxing whatever discomfort arises *immediately* to maintain satisfaction (*Sukkha*).

4.  **The Goal is a Satisfied, Hindrance-Free Mind:**
    *   The foundational work of Anapanasati is to **remove the Five Hindrances** and create a mind that is "fit for work."
    *   This is achieved by **gladdening the mind** (Step 10), cultivating wholesome thoughts, and generating **Piti** (joy/rapture) and **Sukkha** (pleasure/ease)—the factors of the **First Jhana**.
    *   **Sukkha** is defined as feeling **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied**. This state is the opposite of *Dukkha* (unsatisfactoriness).

5.  **Inner & Outer Friendship:**
    *   The practice begins with becoming a **friend to yourself internally**, accepting your "warts and all."
    *   This internal friendship naturally extends to **external friendship** with the world, leading to balance and acceptance of reality as it is.

6.  **Practical Breath Mechanics:**
    *   The breath should be **conscious and controlled**, but **gentle and enjoyable**, not forced.
    *   If breathing feels like strenuous "work," adjust your posture (upright is generally best) and, more importantly, **change your attitude**. The practice should be "good in the beginning, middle, and end."
    *   Experiment and play with the breath; it's a "toy" for understanding the body-mind connection.

7.  **Context & Misunderstandings:**
    *   The sutta's grand introduction suggests the Buddha was offering Anapanasati as a beneficial alternative to other common practices of his time.
    *   **"Mindfulness" (*Sati*)** is clarified as **"remembering"**—remembering to come back to the present moment and to the breath.
    *   Western Buddhism is critiqued for sometimes neglecting the active work of **removing hindrances**, instead passively noting phenomena.

### **Overall Message:**
The Anapanasati Sutta provides a framework for **training the mind into a state of relaxed, wholesome awareness.** By using the breath to calm the body, gladden the mind, and pacify feelings, we create the conditions for insight into reality. The practice is about **friendly investigation and letting go**, not achieving perfect states or systematically checking off steps. Success is found in the immediate feeling of satisfaction and the relinquishment of mental burdens.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A to explain the concepts of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) and meditation:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Pity Party" or "Misery Thoughts":** Used to describe the distracted, negative mental state that short, intense breathing can interrupt.
    *   *Context:* Explaining the utility of the short breath.

2.  **"Let it all hang out":** A colloquial American metaphor for the deep relaxation and relinquishment (letting go) that is the goal of the practice.
    *   *Context:* Describing the end state of integrated Anapanasati practice.

3.  **"Warts and all":** A metaphor for complete acceptance, both internally and externally. It means accepting the entirety of something, including its flaws.
    *   *Context:* Emphasizing the importance of befriending oneself and reality as they are, without judgment. Speaker A later explicitly connects "warts" to the Pali term *asava* (cankers/taints).

4.  **The Ferris Wheel:** A central metaphor for gaining wisdom by stepping back from life's cycles (*anicca*).
    *   *How it's used:* Most people are like someone trapped in a dark, swinging box on a Ferris wheel—terrified and confused by the unpredictable movements. The practitioner, through wisdom, is like someone watching the whole Ferris wheel from the ground, understanding the predictable cycle and thus feeling liberated from fear.

5.  **"Getting the mind fit for work" (attributed to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa):** A metaphor for the preparatory stage of meditation.
    *   *How it's used:* It involves removing hindrances and burdens (like taking off training harnesses) so the mind is clear and ready for the deeper work of insight.

6.  **"Manufactured or made-up word":** A metaphor for the English term "mindfulness," suggesting it is an abstract, modern construct rather than a direct equivalent of the Pali *sati*.
    *   *Context:* Differentiating *sati* as "remembering to be here now" from the vague concept of "mindfulness."

7.  **Body as a "friend":** Contrasted with the common view of the body as "dirty," "ugly," or a thing to be trained. The practice is about re-establishing a friendly, attentive relationship with the body.

8.  **Breath as a "toy to play with":** Encourages an experimental, gentle, and joyful attitude toward breath practice, as opposed to a forceful, goal-oriented struggle.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Ananda and Sariputta:** Speaker A references a sutta where Ananda says Sariputta told him "half of the Dharma is friendship," and the Buddha corrects him, saying, **"No, it's the whole thing."**
    *   *Purpose:* To illustrate that the entire path involves becoming a friend to what's inside you and what's outside you.

2.  **The Narrative of the Sutta's Opening:** Speaker A recounts the beginning of the Anapanasati Sutta itself as a story.
    *   *Key points:* The Buddha announces the talk in advance, drawing a huge crowd of practitioners from different schools (e.g., those practicing *metta* or *jhanas*). The Buddha tells them to listen because Anapanasati is of "great fruit and great benefit," implying it integrates and surpasses their current practices.
    *   *Purpose:* To highlight the importance and integrative power of Anapanasati.

3.  **The Anecdote about Goenka Retreats:** Speaker A mentions that the Goenka Vipassana system "ends at step 3" (body scanning) and gets stuck in a systematic approach, which can lead to avoiding persistent discomfort (like painful knees).
    *   *Purpose:* To contrast a rigid, systematic method with the Anapanasati approach of paying attention "one by one as they occur," and to emphasize comfort and satisfaction as guides.

4.  **The Anecdote about Students and Heartbeats:** Speaker A shares a common experience where students fixate on a sensation (like hearing their heartbeat) and then realize the real issue is their *dislike* of the sensation.
    *   *Purpose:* To teach that the core practice is working with dissatisfaction (*dukkha*), not with the sensory phenomenon itself.

5.  **References to Cultural Practices:** Speaker A briefly mentions **tuba players, Tibetan horn players, and Aboriginal didgeridoo players** as examples of people who train their breathing muscles for deep, sustained breath control.
    *   *Purpose:* To normalize and encourage the training of breath-related muscles as a natural, skillful development.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make complex meditation concepts more relatable, warn against common pitfalls, and promote an attitude of acceptance, experimentation, and friendliness toward the practice.
