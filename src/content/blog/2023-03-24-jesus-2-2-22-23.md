### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Of things that are closer to the Dhamma. Okay. Now, there are a lot of suttas that do talk about the Jhanas. They're listed in great detail, good analogies, and not only that, but also what to do with them, how to get into them, and when you're in one, this is the definition of this is what you're looking at. Okay, then in fact that's what the jhanas actually mean. But the Western mentality about these jhanas has to do with attaining something, getting the mind into a special kind of place, and that they want to go directly there without even understanding that it's got to be done in a kind of an order, and that is you've got to get the jhana factors all collected together. In the first jhana. And then when you're in the first jhana, you basically pick and choose which object of that group that you've gotten together, and that then defines what jhana you're in. Okay, the example of that has to do with that when we're actually in the first jhana, then the object should be the applied and sustained thought, which means keep coming back and coming back and coming back to the here-now, coming back to seeing what's in the mind, coming back over and over again, which is the applied. We keep applying the mind back to the Dharma, back to the wholesome, back to the mind that is free from hindrances, which is the first and most important of the factors of the first Jhana. So there's 6 factors, actually in some suttas 5 and in other suttas there are 6, and the Anapanasati Sutta actually uses all 6. And what is that 6th one is, is that the body is relaxed. And when we mean the body is relaxed, that means it's free from tension, free from uncomfortableness, free from fear, free from dangers, free from bad air. You know, got to get the body in a really nice comfortable state so that it can get really relaxed. And that's part of why we do work with the body, is to find where all the tensions are so that we can relax them. Okay, but then while we're doing that relaxation, we're talking about relaxation. We're not thinking thoughts about, oh, I've got to go get I've got to get this done after I relax, I've got to go, blah, blah, blah, you know, because that keeps everything unrelaxed. So taking those kind of unrelaxing thoughts out of the mind is also part of the relaxing of the body, that we think about relaxing thoughts. And so we apply now the mind to the body, watching the body, watching the breathing, we apply the mind to watching the kind of thoughts that we have, And pretty soon we also apply the mind of watching how we feel with the intention of getting the body feeling good, feeling relaxed. That fulfills one of the Jhana factors. Getting the mind out of the hindrances fulfills another one. And not only that, but we keep applying the mind to this and sustaining it, so that we get both the body and the mind gladdened up, brightened up, kind of like a shoeshine for the mind and the body. And when we're all polished up, now we can use those two things for the feelings, because the feelings are always the result anyway. That when we, when we're on, when the body's uncomfortable, we feel bad. And so when the body becomes comfortable, that gives an opportunity to start to feeling good, as well as the fact that we're talking ourselves into it. Why? Because that's the kind of wholesome talk that we're using, the Dhamma talk, rather than the unwholesome thoughts that would be the hindrances. All right, so now we're beginning together the factors, because the next factor that's on the list of the first Jhana is actually that feel-good that we get from getting the body to feel good, to get the mind to feel good, and so we actually start to feel good. And this is the Pali word, is Sukkha, which actually is just the opposite of Dukkha. And it has definitions in the Pali dictionary of safe and secure. We actually feel safe and secure. Now here's the funny part about it is a lot of people go off on retreats and in that Dhamma hall they don't feel safe and secure. There's lots of eyes in there. Oh, am I doing it right? Oh, I don't— I want to fit in, you know, and all of that. And so they go in there troubled and filled with fear. So it's actually for the beginning students is to not do it in the Dhamma hall, but to do it off in the woods under a tree in an empty hut. Into a pile of straw, things that the Buddha would recommend rather than what's available. Okay, so once we can begin to feel safe, secure, and comfortable, just like the body is safe, secure, and comfortable, now with those thoughts that we're having, we add the next ingredient, which is the key important point, and that is satisfaction, that what we're doing right now is okay. Everything is all right. Satisfaction. Why? Because Dukkha is dissatisfaction. We've just arrived to a state of satisfaction. This is good enough. Okay. And so that's the Jhana factor. The next Jhana factor comes to the word Piti. Comes from the confidence that we get that we can become satisfied. Because in the beginning, we're not sure. So we have to actually play with and become satisfied, we have to practice being satisfied, and students who come to their meditation and are dissatisfied, they're insecure, then that means then that they're not practicing correctly. That to practice incorrectly is actually to practice being satisfied. And with that, it grows. The Sukkha grows into Piti, which now is the quality. This is also the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path that I've been secretly talking about the Eightfold Noble Path all along. These thoughts that we have that we're changing is one's right effort. So we have to wake up to look at what we're doing. We have to remember to wake up. So there's the Sati, to remember to start this process, remember to come into the here-now and take a look at what's going on. And then we take the right effort to ease off, ease off the gas, let the body relax. Let the mind start thinking comfortable, wholesome thoughts. And so, when we do that over and over again, we start not only having just wholesome thoughts, but we have wholesome, comfortable feelings of being satisfied. And then we add the fourth ingredient, that is under the word of Shraddha, or Saddha, which means confidence.

**Speaker B:** Confidence.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, confidence. Confidence of what? Being able to remove the hindrances from the mind and feel good. Over and over again, we feel good. And then the kind of thoughts that will come by— I've got it. This is when we actually change our internal attitude from being a victim to the world Because we were born victims, we were raised victims, all the people around us were victims. Even the rich people are victims. In fact, they're big-time victims to the money. The money runs their life. They don't have any freedom. They got to do what they're told to do, and the money is the one who's speaking in that regard. So everybody's a victim, and we need to come out of that into let us say victory. I can change my mind, I can feel good. Wow, this is so nice. Okay, release, salvation, we've got it. Okay, so this is the next ingredient of the first Jhana. Now this first Jhana needs to be practiced over and over again because it's not a normal state for us to be in. What? Relaxed? What? Comfortable? What? Satisfied? That's pretty strange stuff, you know, because we have been taught in our society to be dissatisfied. You've got to help this place. I mean, this place is broken down and we need your help, Mr. Victim. We just put you to work. Through guilt. So yeah, yeah, who put you to work? The guy who's got the money, who's not going to do the work, but he sure wants the money from your work. And so it's all wrapped up in a system that winds up being a pack of lies that everybody believes. But when we really start looking at the truth and looking for the truth and being willing to say the truth to ourselves and to say it out loud and not lie anymore and really take a look at really what's going on We say, hot dog, I didn't know it was this good. I have been told that this place is broken and it needs my help for fixing it. Yeah. And in a way, I just repeated in a strange humorous way the teachings of Jesus in those statements that he says, like, is that the lilies of the field are already okay. They don't need to dress up in the finery. We're already there. Or the foxes of the fields and the birds have their nests, but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head. He's a wanderer. He doesn't get stuck. Okay, so these are the teachings of Jesus that are absolutely beautifully noble, and that we're actually practicing this in this first Jhana. We talk ourselves into really, really nice states. And it's a skill to be developed. The second, third, and fourth jhana are not skills. They're what we do with the skills that we developed in the first jhana. Oh, okay. Okay, so here's the example of that. Once we get that Piti built up, once we feel all gushy and joyful and full of energy and vibrantly alive, we don't have to talk ourselves into it anymore. We can actually just now focus on how good we feel. How good this is. And that's then the second Jhana, is to focus on how good we feel. But that has a lot of exhilaration and excitement and wow-ness built into it. It's got a thrill, oh, is it thrill, woo-hoo! But that will settle down after a short time into, let us say, a really deep level of satisfaction now. The kind of satisfaction that we were practicing in the first Jhana now is fulfilled in the third Jhana, because we're just finally, wow!— this is so wow! And then we begin to take other items of interest. So in the first Jhana, the item of interest is, what kind of thoughts are we having, what are we doing with these thoughts, are we doing the right thing with these thoughts, etc., like that, applying the effort to have very high-quality thoughts. And then the second Jhana is the reward that we get for talking ourselves into feeling so nice. And now we can actually just experience it without having to keep that crank going anymore. We can just let that crank go. We don't have to crank ourselves up. We already are high.

**Speaker B:** Enough. To.

**Speaker A:** Me, that's very good. Okay. So, what this actually means is, is that these are ordinary states, because children get themselves ecstatic. This is a natural human state. There's nothing really off-ball weird about it, that it's actually something that we can experience joyfully, because we're capable of that. That's one of the things about the Western Buddhism, is that they've got a lot of magical beliefs built into these states, and then when they're practicing, they're trying to get into the magical states that they made up for themselves, and then they're purely disappointed because they can't do what they wanted to do, to where the teachings of the Buddha is quite clear. So in fact, you could say that that's basically been the two kinds of teachings, both at the mundane and the supramundane, and many people are practicing meditation at a mundane level. And that mundane level is full of thoughts and beliefs about what religion, what my practice should be, and what is it to be enlightened, and am I there yet, and all of that kind of stuff. And we can just rise above all of that and come to the fact of, let's ask a very simple question: How good can I feel? Or better for you, The question is, how good can you feel? If you could feel the way that you wanted to feel, wouldn't you want to experiment with various levels of how good you can.

**Speaker B:** Feel? Sounds much better than thinking that all that's old stuff. Yeah, it's very good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes. And so this is really the practice then, is to practice to realize that you are in fact the boss of your life and that you can feel any way that you want to feel. And then decide what you're going to do about it, or not. It's important, in fact, to recognize that what we're doing and how we feel are normally bound up ignorantly, rather than wisely. In other words, we do a job that we know needs to get done, and that knowing it needs to get done is because of some rule that we've got set up. Okay, our own ignorance. Okay, and so we said all this needs to be done, and now we go do it. We don't like doing it, but we do it anyway. All right, so there we are, not liking what we're doing, resenting it. Sometimes we throw it down, and then we feel guilty and pick it back up. And so we throw it down and out of remorse and revenge and guilt, and we got these cycles of things. This is the relationship that we have with all the stuff that we should be doing. But when we recognize that you can feel any way that we want to, now it doesn't matter what you're doing anymore. You can feel the way that you want to while you're doing it. So you don't have to change jobs. All you have to to do is just recognizing that it's your choice. Are you going to do it and feel good, or you're going to do it and feel bad? And so this is the noble.

**Speaker B:** Application, right effort, right? Yes, we're talking about right effort. Now you make it sound so easy.

**Speaker A:** It is, but you have to— in fact, it's easy right now. And then right now, and then right now. Because we're a propensity to start making it hard again. We've been trained that things are hard. Yeah. Then in fact, if everything was easy peasy and everything was okay, the new— I mean, what would newspapers and cable TV and YouTube do? Because nobody's going to watch, because nobody cares, because everything is already hunky-dory. Oh no, we've got to go make a problem to get these people curious about. Mm-hmm. They even have a word for it in the old press, and that was, if it bleeds, it leads. Front page news is the biggest disaster we've had today. Yeah. Well, what are we going to do when we stop having these disasters? Yeah, let's start having disasters because we invented them, we created them in the first place. We made something up. And so now you're recognizing that we can feel the way that we want to, that we're actually practicing the Eightfold Noble Path, and by doing so, the mind becomes more organized, more collected. That we don't have arguments with ourselves. We don't apply a rule and say, I don't want to do that rule, and then apply the rule again and say, okay, I'll do it, and then apply the rule again and now I really hate it but I'll do it anyway, and then we apply the rule again and then we rebel against the rule. You know, I'm just going through this sequence of all of these arguments within the mind, and we don't wake up to it. We don't bring the referee in there and break this fight up. And say, hey, let's have fun together.

**Speaker B:** Instead. Sounds so good. I mean, it's like, makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the natural way that we're trained. And by the way, this rule system is also called the parent or called the superego in Freud's language. But yeah, calling it the rules, that's the the Buddhist language, the rights, rules, rituals, way things are supposed to be, is actually the source of most of our suffering. It's our relationship to our own set of rules.

**Speaker B:** So this fetter is related to the superego, no?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's it, that is the superego. Right. Yeah, the second fetter is the superego. It's the parent ego state, most specifically the critical parent ego state. I never saw it like that. Yeah, and it's just a whole bunch of yakety yakety yakety yakety. You got to do this, you got to do that, it ought to be this way, it ought to be that way. One rule after another after another. Okay, we learn those things, mimic them, and we've got thousands of them, thousands of them. I mean, just the grammar of the English language as opposed to the grammar of Spanish, and now you've got both of them, and sometimes the grammars actually collide, and you have to remember which rule you're applying. Okay, that's how sophisticated it gets, and how many rules there really are inside mind. It's amazing that we don't just, you know, ball ourselves up and clutch ourselves to death over conflicting ideas and rules we've got. But the real point here is, is that let's stop making rules and start enjoying what we've already got. That is the satisfaction. The satisfaction is coming from coming out of the rules. And our reaction in relationship to it. So when we become satisfied, we become unitized, you become whole, the mind is integrated. And so in fact, the Samadhi of the first Jhana, which brings everything together, is also the Samadhi of the mind, because you're bringing all of these components of the mind together. And so the Samadhi mind and the Samatha of Jhana are exactly the same thing. They're just using it from a different perspective. Okay. And this is what the Buddha calls the path to awakening. This is it, this first Jhana. The second, third, and fourth Jhana are toys to be played with once you've got the.

**Speaker B:** Skills. So the first Jhana is the.

**Speaker A:** Path. It's like that is the path. And what is that? Number one, removal of the unwholesome thoughts, the hindrances, the can't-dos, the oh-nos, the work, the job, the frustrations. All of that has to be removed from the mind as soon as we see it. And if we keep seeing it often, we'll remove it often. And then the thought comes, oh, this is a lot of work. No, it's not. This is a lot of work thought is a lot of work. And we have to see that as an unwholesome thought. And now you go to it. Oh, this is a piece of cake. We're having fun here. Give.

**Speaker B:** Me Wow, it sounds, sounds, it feels even, even listening to you feels like that now, like resonates, like, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, and so we could just walk around our spending our lives having being in a good mood. Nothing bothers us anymore because we stop manufacturing unwholesomeness. Let other people do.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** Yep, that's their job if they— if that's what they want to do. But we're going to start having a good easy.

**Speaker B:** Life. I like how that sounds.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that we can in fact drop, uh, all of the problems. The solution to every problem is to stop seeing it as a problem. Just cut right through it. Have you ever heard of the Gordian Knot? Do you know that old story? Goes way back into Sumer, and there was a knot that was tied in the rope and nobody could figure out— I mean, it was like a big prize if somebody could cut the knot.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. Oh my God, this is 30 years ago or something, or 40 years ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they teach this to kids, okay? And what did Gordian do? He took his knife out, his sword, and he just cut right through it. That's the solution, is you just whack. There's no problem here, folks. You don't have to untie it, cut through it. And so that's how we do the mind. A lot of people are out there trying to untie the mind, and the right way to do it is just slice right through it, just say, "Nope, I'm going to have a wholesome thought now. I don't have to worry about where that unwholesome thought came from." Or a way of calling it, we don't need to do psychological archaeology, we don't have to dwell on the problems, dwell on this to find out where they came from. We can just say, "Oh, that's not a problem," and just drop it. That's the way that we practice. Is to change those unwholesome thoughts into the wholesome thoughts of success, satisfaction. But we got to practice. Yep. Boy, do we have to practice. And I often say that we've talked ourselves into feeling bad. For our whole lives we've been talking ourselves into feeling bad. We learned how to do that from Mommy and Daddy and all of the people around us, and we've gotten quite good at doing just what we're told to do. Feel bad, feel sorry, suck up to somebody, do what we're told to do. And now we're going to start talking ourselves into feeling good. I've already done what I needed to do. The job that needed to be done has been done. What is that? To cut out the problem. Now I'm safe. There was no problem there in the first place. And we can do that with all, "We'll do it later," or something. Because right now, not a problem, doesn't exist. Never mind. Let's go back and be happy instead. And this needs to be practiced, so that when we are given a task that we'd normally not like to do, we can in fact get ourselves back into a good mood and then do the job in a good mood. Okay, but starting off a job in a bad mood, hoping to get into a good mood while we're doing it as a job in a bad mood doesn't work. We gotta stop doing the job and get ourselves back into a good mood, and now we can go do the.

**Speaker B:** Work. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, makes.

**Speaker A:** Sense.

**Speaker B:** I have a question, Dhammarato, if I may. When we say practices, I mean, I guess it's like coming back every time and having a wholesome sava or discern, just day by day, our daily life, no? And during the meditation the same, and being comfortable and being just Happy in the body, in the.

**Speaker A:** Mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes. There is this, yes, yes, sorry. There is this, for example, if I, the people that practicing like 3, 4 hours meditation a day, do you recommend this kind of practices, like a lot of hours a.

**Speaker A:** Day or Actually, there has come a kind of a rule or maybe a tradition that started from the Goenka, because Goenka talked about that, that you need to practice an hour a day, but if you really want benefit out of it, you got to practice 2 hours a day, but then you ain't seen nothing until you practice 3 hours a day. So this was an old tradition out of the Goenka. That's gotten kind of stuck into the Western mentality. Yeah. And I would not recommend that people follow that strategy, especially because of the way that the human mind works is that we don't have a good attention span for an hour until we're really, really far along. That in fact, the attention span can be improved. And that's one of the things that we're going to do. But in the beginning, And they know this in school, even though they have classes at universities that last 45 minutes up to 50 minutes and then a little time to move around, the kids can't keep track of that whole 50 minutes. And a good professor will break it into two groups so that he can keep the students' attention good, or take a break in the middle of it. This is also good for us that I would say that 20 minutes should be the maximum, but there's no reason why it should take 20 minutes to get yourself into feeling good if that's what you're doing. People who will sit down for a long meditation, they think that they're going to feel good at the end of it, so why bother to put any effort in the beginning? But if we have short sittings, then we can start off right away with right effort. Yeah. And so then we can get into a really good state in 5 or 10 minutes. And that's the way that I would recommend, is that you get yourself into a really good state, sustain it for just a little bit, another minute or so. And then go use some, go use that state.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that we would practice that, Ben, a minimum of 3 times a day. And probably, in fact, when we really get on it, we can do it for 12 times a day, every day, every— at least once an hour throughout the day for 5 minutes. We just stop and take a deep breath and just relax and say, oh wow, this is all so good. Good. And do that, and do that every hour for 5 minutes. In fact, you probably get more done in 55 minutes by doing that once an hour. That we waste a lot of time because the mind gets tired. We're just not productive up to a certain high degree all the time, that we're up and down and up and down. And so taking a break and actually practicing going back up. You get the mind bright, secure, comfortable, relaxed, satisfied, championed, okay, ready to go. All right, when we get ourselves ready to go, then we can go and go do it happily. This is a way to practice, not sitting there for an hour or so hoping something good will happen. No, we're going to make something good happen right now and then enjoy the benefit of it for a while. And then in between, we will begin to remember, hey, I can take a deep breath and spend only 10 seconds and 20 seconds and get myself back into a really good.

**Speaker B:** State. That sounds wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Needs to be practiced. It needs to be practiced. That's the secret. I mean, you've heard beautiful music and you say, hear that music and you can hear every note and it says, oh, that sounds so beautiful and it sounds so easy, but you can't play it until you practice it. True. And so that's what I recommend, is to start practicing this. Start removing those hindrances out of the mind. Start gladdening the mind, getting the body relaxed. Begin to feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, and work with that. And pretty soon you begin to feel like a star, like a.

**Speaker B:** Champion. Sounds good. Sounds good, Dhammarato. Thank you very.

**Speaker A:** Much. All right, well, Jesus, we'll see you soon. Go practice this now.

**Speaker B:** I will, I will go, I will go now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and, and come back in a few days and we'll talk about it some more. Okay, I'm sure you'll have a question or two. I will for sure. Alrighty, thank you, thank you. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on demystifying the **first jhāna** and framing it as an accessible, practical path of happiness and freedom accessible in daily life. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The First Jhāna as the Path**
- The talk reframes the first jhāna not as an exotic, hard-to-attain trance state, but as a **natural, trainable state of integrated well-being**—the actual path to awakening.
- Western practitioners often misunderstand jhāna as something to “attain” or “achieve” magically, missing that it must be developed **step-by-step** by gathering the jhāna factors.

### **The Six Factors of the First Jhāna**
Dhammarato outlines how to cultivate these factors in order:

1. **Relaxation of the body** – Free from tension, discomfort, fear; creating physical ease.
2. **Freedom from the five hindrances** – Removing unwholesome thoughts (worry, doubt, ill-will, etc.).
3. **Applied thought (vitakka)** – Gently directing the mind back to the present, to wholesome themes, to the breath.
4. **Sustained thought (vicāra)** – Keeping the mind engaged with that wholesome object.
5. **Sukha (happiness/pleasure)** – A feeling of safety, security, and comfort that arises as the body and mind relax.
6. **Satisfaction** – A key factor: being content with the present moment, the opposite of *dukkha* (dissatisfaction).

### **Practical Training Method**
- **Start with short, frequent sessions** – Not long, arduous sits. Recommended: 5–20 minutes, many times a day (up to once an hour), to quickly cultivate a good state and then use it in daily life.
- **Change your internal talk** – We are conditioned to feel like victims, to be dissatisfied, and to follow internal “rules” (superego). The practice is to **talk ourselves into feeling good, safe, and satisfied**.
- **Cut through problems like the Gordian Knot** – Don’t untangle past psychological knots; simply **drop unwholesome thoughts** and replace them with wholesome ones. Shift from “This is a problem” to “I choose to feel good now.”
- **Practice feeling good *before* doing a task** – If you start a task in a bad mood, stop, get into a good state first, then proceed.

### **Relationship to the Noble Eightfold Path**
- This training embodies **Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration**.
- **Right Effort**: Replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones.
- **Right Mindfulness**: Remembering to come back to the present and check the mind’s state.
- **Right Concentration**: The collected, unified mind (*samādhi*) of the first jhāna.

### **Second, Third, and Fourth Jhāna**
- These are **not additional skills** but natural developments once the first jhāna is mastered.
- **Second Jhāna**: The joyful, energetic result (*pīti*) of the first jhāna—you no longer need to “talk yourself” into it; you simply enjoy the bliss.
- **Third Jhāna**: A deeper, calm satisfaction.
- **Fourth Jhāna**: Equanimity.

### **Key Insight: You Are the Boss of Your Mind**
- The ultimate teaching is **you can feel how you want to feel**.
- Our suffering comes from believing internal and external “rules” and narratives. Freedom comes from choosing satisfaction and well-being now, regardless of circumstances.
- This practice leads to an **integrated, harmonious mind** free from inner conflict.

### **Final Advice**
- **Practice immediately** – Start gladdening the mind, relaxing the body, and cultivating satisfaction many times a day.
- **It’s a skill like learning music** – Beautiful to hear about, but you must practice to play it yourself.

In essence, the talk presents the first jhāna as a **practical psychology of happiness**—a way to take charge of your inner state, drop dissatisfaction, and live from a place of relaxed, confident well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the Dhamma and meditation practice. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**
1. **Shoeshine for the mind and body**  
   - *“We get both the body and the mind gladdened up, brightened up, kind of like a shoeshine for the mind and the body.”*  
   - This metaphor illustrates the refreshing, polishing effect of meditation.

2. **Victim vs. victory**  
   - The speaker contrasts being a “victim to the world” with moving into “victory”—the ability to change one’s mind and feel good regardless of circumstances.

3. **Cranking oneself up**  
   - In the first jhāna, one “cranks” the mind into a wholesome state; in the second jhāna, you no longer need to “keep that crank going” because the good feeling is self-sustaining.

4. **Cutting through the Gordian Knot**  
   - This metaphor (also a story) is used to describe dealing with unwholesome thoughts: instead of untangling them psychologically, you “slice right through” by choosing a wholesome thought instead.

5. **Newspaper and “if it bleeds, it leads”**  
   - The media’s focus on problems is compared to how our minds are trained to seek out dissatisfaction and drama.

6. **Rules as the “superego” or “critical parent”**  
   - Internal rules and “shoulds” are compared to Freud’s superego—a source of suffering when we rebel against or feel controlled by them.

### **Stories and Analogies**
1. **The lilies of the field and birds of the air (reference to Jesus’s teachings)**  
   - The speaker references Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount to illustrate that we are already “okay” and don’t need to strive anxiously.  
   - This connects the first jhāna’s satisfaction to a Christian teaching on non-attachment and trust.

2. **The Gordian Knot story**  
   - An ancient tale where Alexander the Great cuts through an impossibly tangled knot instead of trying to untie it.  
   - Used to emphasize direct, decisive abandonment of unwholesome thoughts rather than over-analyzing them.

3. **Children’s natural joy**  
   - The speaker notes that children can become ecstatic naturally—suggesting that joyful, absorbed states (jhāna-like) are innate, not magical or weird.

4. **Goenka meditation hour recommendations**  
   - The speaker references Goenka’s advice to meditate longer for greater benefit, then contrasts it with his own recommendation for short, frequent practice sessions.

### **Key Themes Woven Through Metaphors and Stories**
- **From suffering to satisfaction** – Moving from *dukkha* (dissatisfaction) to *sukkha* (ease, safety) through intentional thought training.
- **Meditation as a skill** – First jhāna is the foundational skill; higher jhānas are “toys” to play with once the skill is mastered.
- **Cultural conditioning** – We’re trained to be dissatisfied; meditation is re-training toward satisfaction.
- **Practical, accessible practice** – Short, frequent sessions are compared to taking breaks to refresh productivity, rather than long, passive sits.

These metaphors and stories help demystify jhāna and frame meditation as a natural, trainable skill for well-being.
