### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, friends. It's Saturday morning in Thailand at 9 AM and evening time in— Friday evening in the West. And today we want to touch on several topics, and the first one that we want to talk on is basically a completion of what was talked about on last Sunday on the call about the word anatta, and that basically what the word means is not no self, and it doesn't even mean specifically no soul, but what it's talking about is that there is no eternal soul or let us say unchanging soul or unchanging self, that in fact, uh, the two extremes would be eternalism and nihilism. And nihilism would be there's no souls, there's no self, there's nothing. And in Sutra number 117, that's expressed as no mother, no father, no teachers, no no action and result of action and other things like this. And you can imagine that the people who hold that kind of view would be the ones who— it's kind of a childish view, basically, that has the phrase, I can get away with anything, I can get away with it. The other extreme would be eternalism, which means that there is result of good and bad action, there is authority figures, there is perhaps even a God. But the teaching of Anatta means that it's neither one of those things, it's in between perhaps, and that it's subject to investigation. That we have to keep looking. So in a way, you can say that no self is not the correct translation, because no self, none at all, would be a nihilistic view, as opposed to there is a self, there is a soul, and it's permanent. And that would be eternalism.. And so probably the best way to describe it, humorously in fact, would be sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Things happen because of causes and conditions, and that it's important for us to start paying attention to that. Now, we can also go so far as to say that nihilism and eternalism are merely concepts, they're merely ideas, and that what we're actually practicing is reality. So we can talk about the Anatta in that regard, in the introduction of that there is no eternal overlord, there is no eternal owner. That in fact, at best, ownership is quite temporary. You can think of being a guest rather than being the owner. And you can think of that in— in reality, you're a guest in your own body. That body is temporary, but there's no landlord that's going to come and kick you out. But the house is going to fall down because it's temporary too. All things are temporary in that regard. And that as we are, let us say, raised from infancy into childhood, we as children ignorantly get the delusion going that there are authorities. There's a mommy that's going to bosses around, and a daddy and uncles and teachers and whatnot like that. And so we get into a victim's position of needing to be taken care of. And almost everyone, in fact you could say that everyone, continues to grow up in that victim's position so that by the time that we become an adult the, um, uh, the top dog, or the one that we are a victim to, is actually some god or some overlord, some kind of an authority over us. And that, uh, the priests and preachers make quite a lot of money off of that, um, keeping us in a one-down position. Also, we don't really have a good handle on what happened in the time, the lifetime of Jesus, but we do know that by the 2nd century, around 320, Constantine changed religions in the Roman Empire from Mithraism into Christianity, which means it became a state religion, which meant that Christianity, let us say, performed the duties of keeping the emperors of Rome and the popes, etc., in charge. They became the substitutes for the big authority figure of God. But Buddha says that doesn't exist. That kind of overlord, that kind of an authority doesn't exist with us. That what we have instead is the reality of the situation that needs to be investigated rather than deciding that we're a victim to some god. Or some religion, or some government, or some authority like that. Now, what happens with us is that we also sometimes decide that we are the authority. We're the one who knows. We're the guy in charge here. And so we can see that in the realm of advice. Mickey asked to talk about advice some today. We can see that if we are given advice, the reality is that we don't have to take that advice. As a child, when an adult gave advice, the child felt obligated to take the advice, but he didn't want to, and so he rebelled. We rebel against authority by not taking advice. And the opposite of that is that then when we give advice, we become the authority and say, "Do what I say to do, take my advice," to where no one is under any obligation at all to take your advice. In fact, most likely what's going to happen when you give advice is that they're going to rebel against it and not do it, or try to figure out a way around what you've had to say. And so that just goes further to prove that there is no authority, that everybody is out there on their own. Now, that also means that as far as getting help, there's no real help available. The advice that you are given You have to go and investigate that advice and apply that advice and make sure that you're practicing correctly and continue to look to see that. And also, on the other side of that, that when you do gain some proficiency, become what Mikey calls a seasoned practitioner, then you give advice, and the likelihood is that people are not going to take it. And so we're caught in this system of rebelling against an authority that does not exist, and we pretend to be an authority when in fact we can't do that. And so this is basically the main source then for bad feelings, or Dukkha, is because of this delusion of this one-up, one-down system that we call hierarchy. And the reality is, is that in nature there is no reality of hierarchy. Everything is just subject subject in fact to cause and effect. The Pali word for that is itthiyapapajjata. Everything is subject to causation. So in that regard, when the self comes up, it comes up because of conditions. It's conditioned to do certain things, and the conditioning for the becoming of a self is in fact clinging. And the clinging is in fact conditioned by our feelings, and our feelings are conditioned by that which contacts us. And what contacts us is in fact the stories that we make up about what we take on as input. And that story-making process is then— would be referred to as In the Pāli, nama rūpa, we can think of it as perception, but a better way of talking about it is storytelling, that we tell ourselves stories. And one of the main stories that we tell ourselves is, I'm not good enough, I can't do it, I've got to go find an authority figure to tell me how to do it so that I can rebel against him. And this is the way that we live our lives. Because of ignorance. And so the solution to the ignorance actually is investigation. And the investigation has to be ongoing. It is not a one-time shot where you see something and then you make up a concept, oh, I saw it and I know what it's like, because Everything is subject to change, including our perceptions. And so the entire practice of the teaching of the Buddha is to have an ongoing investigation, to investigate the four foundations of mindfulness, to investigate what's going on with the body, to investigate what's going on with our feelings, to investigate what's going on with our mental states and to continue to investigate the thoughts that come up. So this is all coming from Sutra number 117 called the Great Forty, and that we investigate in order to see clearly so that we can change that there is nothing permanent. There is no such thing as a personality. But in fact, we are taught that people, by the time that they grow up, they have an established personality. This is who they are. Now, we can also see that much of our personality is based upon how we were trained. That the sons become like their father. In fact, as much as the son rebels and hates the father when he's a teenager, by the time he's 40, he's just like his dad because of that programming that we ignorantly take on. That in fact, you can be whatever you want to be so long as you can investigate what you are right now and make a change to that to become what you want to be right here, right now. Now, one of the things that happens with this process of investigation is that people will investigate how they are. They see, oh, this is not satisfactory. Oh, this is in fact unwholesome. And then the next thought that they will have is, that's terrible, I should not be having unwholesome thoughts, which is just another unwholesome thought. That in fact, the wholesome thought to have would be, aha, I see you, unwholesome thought, and therefore we can make a change to it. So This is in fact the entire process. It's actually quite a simple process, but it has to be practiced over and over and over again. Nothing is fixed. Everything is changing. It's a fluid environment. And that for some reason or another, people get the idea that that fluid environment is actually kind of fixed. But that's only true because we don't investigate correctly to see that there's no entity, there's no landlord, there's no God that's causing things to happen, that it's just merely the conditioning of reality. For instance, at one time they had a sky god they called him Zeus in Greek, uh, system, and that the sky god was in charge of the weather and that he would throw his, uh, trident and it would land in the form of lightning. And so lightning— uh, uh, GTC, can you turn your microphone off? There's a lot of noise on.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker C:** Thank.

**Speaker A:** You. So if we can see then that there is no sky god, there is no Zeus there, and that by the way Zeus and, uh, uh, oh, Jupiter and other, um, old gods like that, and including, uh, uh, Woden the sky gods actually are just simply cause and effect, that there is no God up there. But religions can capitalize on that and say, oh yes, there is a God up there and we know all about him and we can communicate with him. So you give us your money and we'll operate in behalf of that God. And, uh, it's all just kind of a magic show. And that, uh, that leaves everyone without a real way of dealing with reality because we've got these delusions, these belief systems about it. So the correct way of practice is to see, first off, there is no overlord. There is no deity, and that there is nothing permanent, including nothing permanent about your personality. This is in fact the first fetter to be overcome, is to recognize that you're not fixed, that you can change. The second one is that we have the second fetter is called Sila Bhata Paramasa. And what that actually means is, is that what becomes the overlord, what becomes the, the god, is in fact the kind of delusions we have when we make up rules. So ritualized behavior, rules, the way things are supposed to be, idealism, affects us quite a lot. We think, in fact, that that ideal is real, where in fact, no, it's just a story that we made up. And so if we can begin to see through these supposed whos, rights, rules, rituals, we can begin to see also that we've been living our whole lives either conforming or rebelling against this system of belief that has no basis in reality. There's many examples of that. One of them is the medical profession. The doctors go around telling people, oh, you need to do this and you need to do that, and this and that is bad, and all of this kind of stuff, to where in fact they don't know a lot. It's not wise to rely upon medical profession, and that there is a group of people who are called hypochondriacs that go and constantly rely upon, oh, they need help from a doctor, or they need this diagnosed and that diagnosed, and they need this, that, and the other thing. One of the things that I saw as a child as a contradiction like that was that they say that being obese, being overweight is dangerous and it shortens life. Well, I had a great big old fat great-great-grandmother who died at the age of 101. No, 103 she did. And then I had her daughter, Grandma young, who died in her late 90s, but she died kind of early because the doctors gave her a colostomy, and that's what killed her, not her old age. And then my grandmother had 3 sisters. All of them were fat except for one, Aunt Iris, and Aunt Iris was the one who died youngest, and all the rest of them who were fat including my grandmother, died at the age of over 100. Well, if you've got that kind of evidence and you see it often, then in fact, George Burns is another good example. They say that smoking and drinking is bad for one's health, and yet he lived to be over 100 smoking great big fat stogie cigars. And drinking wine. He was known to be a drinker. So medical profession is not always correct, and yet we go to them for all kinds of advice instead of doing what really needs to be done, and that is to investigate your own body to make sure that you can see what's going on and deal with your own body accordingly, rather than looking for some authority figure to take care of you. Because there is an awful lot of authority figures out there that'll care for you for a great big fat fee. And so be careful about paying a lot of money. Now, I'm not saying don't ever go to a doctor. They are good for some things. They're good for setting broken bones, for instance. But a lot of the stuff that doctors do is not curative. There was an old joke on television. Maybe you've heard of the series was The Beverly Hillbillies, when Granny came up with a concoction for curing the common cold. And it was a great big deal until she described that the common cold that she's got this concoction that if you take it, every day, your common cold will go away within 2 weeks. Well, guess what? Common colds will go away within 2 weeks whether you take any medicine or not. So there are so many different places that we can see that we rely upon authorities, to where in fact the reality, or the real way to deal with people, is to deal with them in the moment of what's happening right now, based upon investigation, to look and to see, to look at your own body, to look at the way that you feel. Another system of authority figures is called psychology and psychiatry, to where the psychiatrist, all they know how to do is to give out pills, and that the psychologists normally go for talk therapy. But there was experiments done back in the 1970s that were kind of buried because it didn't give the results that they wanted. And it was a double-blind controlled study to where some people who were depressed were given medication, some people who were depressed were given talk therapy, and some people who were depressed was given an exercise program, a regime. And guess what the results were? That exercise was the best cure for depression, not talk therapy, not the pills. And guess who has to do the exercise? Does the psychologist do your exercise for you? No. Does the psychiatrist's pills cure you? No. But you can cure yourself by getting up and getting out and moving about and seeing what's going on with your own body. So these are the ones that I'm pointing out. That doesn't mean that we don't use any advice or we don't use any teachers. But just remember that the teacher cannot do it for you. You've got to do the work. You can sit in, for instance, a math class and listen to the teacher, but until you go and do the examples yourself, you're not going to get a whole lot out of math. You've got to go do it yourself. This is the main teaching that we can say that can be applied then to the teachings of the Buddha rather than seeing him as a great big teacher in the sky or something magical, whatever like that, is to be able to see that what he has to say can be applied to yourself in your own life. And that's it. You do it yourself. He was the only thing that he had going. In fact, there's a Sutra number 104, I think, where Ananda, after the Buddha's death, was visiting a Brahmin, and the Brahmin asked him, what's the difference between the senior students of the Buddha and the Buddha himself? And Ananda answered, there is no difference except that the Buddha was the one who figured out that we can make changes to our lives. And then he made those changes, and everybody else behind him got that information from him, but they had to do their own practice. And so the difference between the Buddha and the Arahant is only that the Arahant followed the teachings of the Buddha and practiced it themselves, as opposed to the Buddha had to go and figure it out because there was no one who could give him the instructions on how to do it. And the basic instructions in the Eightfold Noble Path is number one, to remember to keep looking, to keep coming back, to keep remembering to be in the present moment over and over and over again. Why? Because we are subject to instincts and we're subject to old patterns of the mind. We're subject to rules and rituals that we've been practicing. We could call all of this habits, habit patterns of the mind, and that those habit patterns of the mind becomes one's destiny. But we can overthrow that destiny by remembering to come back to the present moment and see how things are right this very minute. This is the basic practice. We don't have to go to a retreat. We don't have to sit on the floor in a meditation hall with candles and incense and a picture of the Buddha or a monk or someone sitting up on the dais. We don't have to practice meditation in that formal way, but we can practice over and over and over again. We can practice to look at what we're doing, look at what our thinking is. And then change it for the better. This is the practice over and over and over again. So we have these three things to remember: to investigate, to look, and to make a change. These three things become skills that wrap around each other, that work around, going one after the other in the circle, and that basically The major problem that people have in the practice of meditation is that they'll have— they'll remember to look and to make a change and to change the unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. And then the next thought is going to be an unwholesome thought, like, is this good enough? Or this is hard to do. Or, I feel joyful, but not joyful enough. So we need to see that second thought also, so that that second thought, we can change it into a wholesome thought also, and then the thought after that, so that we can begin to have one wholesome thought after another, after another in a sequence. But they don't happen automatically. We have to remember to make that change one thought at a time. This is all there is to it, is to make that change one thought after the other. Now there's a sutta number 119. The name of it is Two Kinds of Thought, where the Buddha talks about what is a wholesome thought and what is an unwholesome thought, and thoughts of greed, Thoughts of ill will, thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of getting something are all considered unwholesome thoughts. And thoughts that have no greed, no ill will, no cruelty are in fact wholesome thoughts. Then the Buddha gives an example of a cowherd. Now, this cowherd is not like they had in Rawhide, where you've got thousands of cattle that are being driven to a remote destination, that this cowherd only has about 8 or so cows, and that his job is to take the cows out in the morning and go through the village to the place where there is food for them, rice stubble and pasture land. But the cows, when they're going through the village, They see the vendors and they want to get carrots off of the vendor store. They also want to just go as they please and not watch the children. If the cowherd let those cows just go, they'll get into the laundry, they'll stamp around, they'll throw things up. And if this happens, the village people are going to become very unhappy with this cowherd because he's not well managing his cows. But once he sees that the cow is about to misbehave, this is why he carries a stick so that he can whack that cow and says, you don't take that carrot, you don't go in that direction, you stay in line until you get out to the pasture. Once the cows get out to the pasture, now the cowherd can relax. He can keep his eye focused on the cattle, but he has to watch them, but he doesn't have to stand there with them whacking them. So you can see now that that's the same as the practice that we have, is that when we are beginning to get started, We have to guard that mind because that mind is like a cow. It's likely to go anywhere. And so we have to whack that cow to get him back into the right path. And so over and over and over again, we have to correct the mind, put it into the wholesome state. And then when it gets out to the pasture, he can— the mind then can stay in that wholesome pasture, one wholesome thought after another after another. And so this is the practice. Once we can get the mind in that state to where we can have one wholesome thought after another after another, that is when we begin to really feel good. Well, I can do this. Well, I can control my mind. But we have to practice over and over and over to do that. Now, this is Sutra number 117 that we're talking about, that when we get that fourth item that is called Samma Sanghappa, and it's an attitude change. So the beginner is going to start Anapanasati or start the Eightfold Noble Path practice. Like a loser, like a victim. Oh, this is hard. All the unwholesome thoughts keep coming back and coming back. But if you keep practicing, then these thoughts can become wholesome because we take them and make them wholesome. You can begin to see, I can have one wholesome thought after another after another, and that gives one confidence so that we can do it. So that we come to the point that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, no matter how unwholesome it has become, I can see that and I can change it. Wow, I can do this. Now that's a major change in attitude from being a victim— oh poor me, this is so much work— into becoming the winner of I can in fact keep my mind pure. I can keep it wholesome. So this is actually the practice. And when we can do these four things of remembering, to look, to change, and to congratulate ourselves for it, that brings about a state of mind that's called unification of mind. The Pali word for it is Samadhi. But the word Samadhi has been rightly and wrongly translated into the word concentration. And then many people think that concentration means to focus down on one little object rather than this broad way of looking at what you're thinking, looking at how you feel, looking at the way that you see things, in other words, your mental state or your attitude, and look at the body. So it's not concentrating on any one particular thing. A lot of people think that Anapanasati is actually focusing on the breath and focusing on the nostrils, and that's not in the suttas anywhere. That's not what the Buddha taught. That in fact he doesn't teach focus at all. What he talks about instead is unification of bringing the body, the mind, the mental states, and the feelings into a unification. This is the teaching of Samadhi, and that we can practice that with Anapanasati. Step— not a step, but item number 9 is in fact this investigation And then item number 10 is to gladden the mind. Now, when we say gladden the mind, that's it. That's two things going on. One is that we have wholesome thoughts. And then the gladdening part of it is to change that attitude from being the attitude of a victim into the attitude of a winner. With that winner's attitude, we can begin to change our feelings. So that we can feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. This is the teaching of the Buddha: safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. We have to keep practicing that over and over and over again, and when we do, we'll get great results, great benefit. But for some reason, this seems to be really a weird thing to do And so people keep questioning and keep thinking about it and whatnot like that instead of just actually doing it. To practice, to remember, to look at the thought and to change it into a wholesome thought, which is gladdening the mind, which changes our attitude and changes the way that we feel. Safe, secure, comfortable means that the body becomes comfortable. And the body relaxes. If the body is not comfortable, there's no way to come to the state of satisfaction. So we have to be safe, secure, comfortable, and then satisfied. This is the way to practice, and this is the only teaching that the Buddha gave. That's the only teaching he gave. And yet there has been in Western Buddhism all kinds of other systems and techniques that have been developed. Some of them are called Vipassana. One of the things that I'll mention about the word Vipassana is, is that it's very rare. It doesn't appear in the Mahayana at all, and it only appears in the Samyutta Nikaya in one or two specific places. And so the Buddha did not teach Vipassana, which is translated as insight. He taught instead to investigate and see what's there. Now, insight actually normally means insight into something really deep that we have to go digging down. And this is why they also talk about it in the sense of concentration. You've got to go deep into meditation. But this is not what the Buddha taught. He taught to investigate what you can find right here on the surface and change that. Don't worry about changing something deep, because deep doesn't really exist. That you can think of it as deep is the same thing as this Atta, or this soul, or the self that goes really deep and is hard or impossible to change. Rather, see it as easy to change because it's right there on the surface. All we have to do is to look and to see and to change. This is the basic teaching of the Buddha. So let's pause there and get some feedback. So, Matt, this talk is for you. What do.

**Speaker D:** You think? Yeah, right on. Thanks for explaining that.

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** So I was really struck when I was looking at the Anapanasati Sutta. I also, I didn't see anything about focusing on the nostrils or this area or any of the kind of things that I was learning before.

**Speaker A:** And Mahasiddhas were not there, nowhere, until you get to literature that's 1,000 years after the time of the.

**Speaker F:** Buddha.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's super interesting. Like, to put it into— so you were pointing out that the Anapanasati Sutta makes more sense, like, with the context of this previous sutta that's talking about the— I think this is the one with the metaphor of the cowherder.

**Speaker A:** No, that's number 19. So we have 19 and then 117 and 118.

**Speaker G:** Okay, right.

**Speaker D:** The one before is the one that's, uh, talking about this, uh, you said the four, the four steps. There's the remember to look, there's the categorizing wholesome, unwholesome, there's the changing, and then there's the.

**Speaker H:** Congratulating.

**Speaker A:** Okay, which is the gladdening the mind, the brightening the mind, changing the mind's attitude. And that's what brings about the Samatha, is your attitude change. So let's move on. We'll come back to you.

**Speaker E:** Okay?

**Speaker A:** Um, uh, Christina, what do you have to say?

**Speaker I:** I thought it was helpful to make the distinction that Anatta, that translation is deceiving and that it suggests that not-self is fixed and permanent. And that's not a helpful translation. I tend to say Anatta, non-self, and use that as like footing, but that's not.

**Speaker A:** Helpful. No, that's nihilistic, in fact. The correct way to say it is, sometimes I'm selfish. Can I see when I'm selfish? That's unwholesome.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, yeah. No, that's very helpful. Thank.

**Speaker A:** You. So, Karwan, I guess you're in traffic, so we'll leave you alone for the moment. Ivan, what do you have to.

**Speaker C:** Say? Yeah, I think like when people want to catch this, you know, like deep thoughts or like they want to, the insight, like deep meditative state is like, like the way I see it is like the current arising thought is It's the only thought you have to see, the only thought you need to catch and change that. Like, it's right there in the surface, but people don't think that's important. People want this, I don't know, somewhere deep inside, but that's the procrastination on practice or not practicing correctly. I just want to say.

**Speaker A:** That. That you can see that that idea of these psychological problems that are buried so deep in our psyche, that comes from psychology, that comes from psychiatry. And guess where they got it? They got it from religion. And so even though psychology and psychiatry didn't even exist in the time of the Buddha, what he taught about anatta was about the religions, in the sense of things are seen to be long-lasting and permanent, where in fact they're not. They're temporary. They're temporary arising. They come right to the surface, and when they come to the surface, you can see them. No need to go.

**Speaker C:** Deep.

**Speaker A:** And that I've seen people who can see the defilement or the unwholesome thought come up. And this woman was actually in— in fact, she still is— a meditation teacher. And when she saw those unwholesome thoughts come up, what was her thought? Aha, I see you and I can change you right now. No, her thought was, oh, I need to go deep into meditation. So that I can find that. Well, guess what? She missed the opportunity right then and there. Right then and there, she could have dealt with it, but instead she says, oh, I've got to trot right over to the meditation hall and sit my butt down on some cushion and wait for a while and then see what happens. And that's not the way that the Buddha taught. He did not teach meditation. No place in the suttas is the word meditation ever. What he did teach was go to the forest, go to an empty hut, go to the foot of a tree, and sit down and start looking at what's going on. That's what the Buddha taught. And so, uh, in fact, it's only in the past 50 or so years that meditation retreats have ever existed. It didn't exist for 2,500 years. It's a new invention, and it's a real moneymaker. And guess what? The people who are running these retreats are not super-duper gurus. They're not great teachers. They're just ordinary people who are practicing wrongly and teaching you to practice strongly also. So Matt, you turned your camera back on. Can you— do you have something else to say, a question or whatever?

**Speaker E:** So this is actually Sean. It's Matt and Sean.

**Speaker B:** Here.

**Speaker E:** And I just wanted to chime in and yeah, ask a question. I really appreciate everything you're saying in regards to the issue with the authority figure. And then, I mean, even in the sense that, like, not even making yourself one, like saying these things, but the idea is for us to go and try it, you know, like, why not? Maybe it is all on the surface. I hadn't— so that's the idea. And I think that that's really easy to get behind. And I would like to start doing that more. I've been dabbling a bit. What I've watched earlier, but I was curious if we had, if we could just go through an example, like an easy one. Like, right now, I mean, so I have a lot of like, got a head injury a few years ago. So I have a lot of pain that's like just always like in my body all the time. And like, but and I noticed here.

**Speaker A:** It'S not, it's not there all the time. This is the whole teaching. Anagami does not mean that there is no pain ever, but it also means that there is no pain there all the time. That all the time is the problem. You just said it's there all the time, and you already know that it's only there occasionally, and when it comes up, you don't like it.

**Speaker E:** And that's a really good pointer, I think. And then the other question was, so right now it is here. And so I guess— because you're paying attention to it.

**Speaker A:** Probably. But when you're paying attention to me, you're not paying attention to.

**Speaker E:** It.

**Speaker H:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And then you go back and pay attention to it.

**Speaker E:** Again.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker E:** So the idea perhaps would be to get present in the room that I'm in or with what you're saying. Like, this is the prescription, right? Like, this is the recipe is watch for this feeling of like, I don't like this. I don't want this.

**Speaker A:** That's the issue. Pain is just a pain. The "I don't like you" is like cutting yourself a second time. I— but if you can say, oh, I see the pain, but I have been dealing with it, and I can deal with it right now, I don't have to see it as pain, I don't have to hate it, I don't have to not like it. The pain comes and goes when you pay attention to it. It comes and goes. Well, whenever it comes, you don't like it because that's your habit. You can change that habit from instead of, "I don't like this pain," into, "Oh, I see you again. There it is. I see you. Aha, I see you, Mr. Pain." And, and I'm still okay. So the problem is not the pain itself, the problem is you don't like.

**Speaker E:** It, right?

**Speaker A:** And that's the part that you have control.

**Speaker C:** Over.

**Speaker E:** And I think you're on— you're like, you're, you're, you're hitting a nail on the head in terms of like what the process is, is like, it's not that I don't like it, is that there's like more to it. It's this feeling that it like, it's an unsafe feeling, right? Like this feeling. And so I guess what we're saying is, is that the way, as an example, through that is to change the thought into like looking around the room and like noticing how safe I am, regardless of the presence of the pain or not.

**Speaker A:** Is this the idea? Exactly, that you are safe even though there's some pain there. It's not killing you right now. It doesn't have you on the floor with his hand— the pain's got his hands around your neck choking you. It's just there from time to time, and when it does come, you don't like it. And it's your not liking it that has you on the floor, uh, with his, uh, hands around your throat. Not the pain, it's you're not liking it that's causing you so much Dukkha.

**Speaker E:** And then I guess, yeah, like, so I think I've been playing with those two first steps. I think the last one of the congratulate yourself feels different. And I'm so like, if we walk through the whole thing, notice the pain, notice the aversion to the pain, notice that I'm okay instead and focus on that. And then what? It's like pat yourself on the back, I did it type of thing.

**Speaker A:** That's it.

**Speaker E:** That's the next step.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can do that. And the more you do this, the better at it you'll get, the more results, the more benefit you'll gain, and therefore the higher the congratulations. So that the pain becomes nothing at all. Right now you're saying, oh, it's always there. Oh, poor me. Oh, I hate it. I need to get rid of the pain, right? There will come a time when you say there's nothing to it. I can handle that. All an attitude change. Okay. All right. So Michael Swift, what do you.

**Speaker B:** Think? I think this was a great talk, Dhammarato. Thank you very much. I'm reminded of a thing. I just recently watched the Charlie Sheen documentary, and that was his catchphrase, winning. And I can relate it to maybe not in that sense, but the winner's attitude.

**Speaker A:** And yes, yes, become that winner, because you can, you can become the winner over your own bad feelings. Yes, you can become the winner over your attitude so that you no longer feel like a victim, especially to some authority figure, so that you can become confident. In yourself, knowing that that self is a moving object, right?

**Speaker B:** I believe you said in one of the previous talks the word for that is Prajna.

**Speaker A:** Prajna, right? Confidence. The confidence you can do this.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. So how about you, Rose? Do you have something to say? No, I thought that was really good and I can apply it to my headaches. So thank you for that example. Yes, good. How about you.

**Speaker F:** Red? Yeah, I just, when big sources of pain come, One recent one was my headaches and my Anapanasati was not acting well either. So it was like two sources of quote-unquote pain. So I was able to remember some of those, some of the time that that pain was arising. Yes, I can do that. But I still don't have the habit of doing that at all the time, so I'm just.

**Speaker A:** Learning. Don't try to think that you've got to do it all the time, but what the important thing is is that you can do it right now when you think of it, right now, over and over and over and over. Remember, nothing is permanent. Uh, the operative word, by the way, is unremitting. Unremitting is like this, over and over and over and over. And a lot of people think that meditation is like this, okay? And it comes up and then it stays there. Think of it like, uh, playing a drum. Is this the right way? This is the mallet and this is the drum head. Is this the right way to play a.

**Speaker D:** Drum?

**Speaker A:** No, probably no. No, you hit it, you hit it, you hit it over and over and over again. This is the way. And when you become skilled at this, it's like becoming a skilled drummer so that you can do it in a row. Now keep coming back and keep coming back.

**Speaker F:** Oh yeah, you said about the opportunity.

**Speaker D:** Also.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker F:** That— what about the small pains? What about the small sources of pain that people keep forgetting also?

**Speaker A:** Well, this is why we need to practice, is because small things will continue to come based upon conditions. Sometimes there's small things and sometimes they're not. Sometimes there's this small thing and then that small thing. When these come, can you remember to look? Because if you can look and see it, you can change it.

**Speaker F:** We can do it. That's a practice.

**Speaker I:** Basically.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Manny, welcome, friend. Is this your first call? Yeah. Welcome. What do you have to say about what you've heard.

**Speaker C:** Today?

**Speaker A:** Uh, there's one to ask. How do you tell if a thought is wholesome or unwholesome? All right, that question is actually an unwholesome thought. Let us say this, that let's put the wholesome thoughts on a continuum, or thoughts on a continuum— so that at one end of the scale, they're unwholesome. They have thoughts of greed, ill will, thoughts of harming, thoughts of not getting what one wants, thoughts of being a victim. On the other end are thoughts that we know absolutely are wholesome: thoughts of "I can do this," "Wow, this is great," "No problems." No worries, got nothing to do and no place to go, isn't this nice? All of those are wholesome thoughts. But most of the thoughts you have are someplace in the middle. And that the job is, is that by practicing having thoughts that are, you know, are wholesome, and practicing having thoughts that you know are not wholesome to be thrown out and to change them to wholesome thoughts, fairly soon you you'll begin to see that most of those thoughts that were in between are actually not so badly unwholesome. They're just generally unwholesome. An example would be, oh, I've got to go to the bank, and then we think about what we're going to do at the bank. That's an okay thought, not necessarily terribly unwholesome. But how many times do you think about going to the bank before you actually go to the bank, when in fact you don't even need to think about going to the bank but one time. But we plan and we plan and we plan and we plan and we waste our time thinking about going to the bank when we could think about right now, I don't have to go to the bank, everything is great right now. And yet we keep planning and planning and planning and doing the same thing over and over and over again which is not getting us in the state of feeling really good. So most of the thoughts that you have are in fact unwholesome, or a better way of saying it, they're hindrances because they hinder a person into feeling really, really good, safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, and successful. Those would be.

**Speaker G:** Wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** What do you think? How do you stop thinking the unwholesome thoughts? Well, the first thing you got to do is to see it and then change it. Change it to one of the wholesome thoughts that I just mentioned, like, hey, I can handle that. Oh, there's no problem here. I don't have to think about that. I can think about something nice instead. And what is something nice? Everything is okay. Think of thoughts of being satisfied with how things really are, as opposed to wanting things to.

**Speaker C:** Be different.

**Speaker A:** Makes sense. Easy enough to do, but we can sit there and ask and ask and ask and ask and ask questions. But until you actually practice changing the mind from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought, we're not getting any benefit. Then in fact, wanting to know the answer to questions is unwholesome because you don't know the answer now to that question. But you're, you're okay right now. So instead of saying, I need to know the answer to that question, you can say, oh well, I can happily research it because I'm okay now, even though I don't know.

**Speaker E:** Just, just to clarify, with the bank example, like, if you thought, hey, I have to go to the bank And continuing to think about what you need to do at the bank instead of— that's like unwholesome or, you know, kind of on that line. Maybe something more wholesome perhaps would be to just like realize how comfortable this couch is and just kind of, yeah, like everything's okay.

**Speaker A:** I'm here on this couch. Everything's okay. And everything will be fine when I do go to the bank. So the only things that we need to do in advance is to make sure that we've got the pile of stuff that we need at the bank— got the ID, got the checks, got the passbook, got the, uh, whatever we need in a pile. And now that we've got that pile going, all we have to do is sit back and enjoy the moment until the moment when we get up and go to the bank. We don't have to keep thinking about the bank over and over and over again. Most people will go to the bank in their head 100 times before they actually go to.

**Speaker F:** The bank.

**Speaker A:** And you can take that to anything. Thank you. Thank you. Going to school 100 times before we actually go to school, when in fact we only need to think of it one time. And then the rest of the time we can think of, wow, I don't have to go to the bank right now. Oh, everything is okay right now. No worries, mate. Everything is good right now. So these are the kind of wholesome thoughts that we start to develop. Okay, CT or GCT, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker G:** Uh, yeah, I just want to say I think you're a cantankerous old man and I love you and respect you to death because you're me 20 years.

**Speaker A:** From now. Yeah, right, probably not.

**Speaker G:** I deal with— I do— I deal.

**Speaker A:** With people all day long.

**Speaker H:** Pardon?

**Speaker G:** I deal with people all day. I deal with people all day long, and we're— we are— you and I are just almost.

**Speaker A:** The same. What, not expecting anybody to do what we advise them to.

**Speaker G:** Do, huh? Uh, well, you tell them to go left, they go right, and then want to know why the brakes failed. Mhm. So, but yeah, that's— and the time thing, I don't know if you remember this, but a lot of my patients, I have them listen to Jimmy Buffett. You.

**Speaker A:** Remember him? Don't.

**Speaker G:** Know him. He had a song. Yeah, he had a song in the late '70s. He went to Paris looking for answers to questions that bothered him so. Well, at the end of the song, he's 80 years old. He still hadn't found the answers. And somebody asked me, I'd play it for my students, and they'd say, well, what does that mean? You'll find the answers or you won't, one way or.

**Speaker A:** The other. Actually, the answers are not important. What's the important thing is can you feel good? Can you feel okay? Rather than being bad because we don't know. Exactly.

**Speaker G:** He never found the answers, and he says some of it was magic, some of it was tragic. But you know what? I had a good life all.

**Speaker A:** The way.

**Speaker G:** Yeah. And too many people don't understand that. Too many people don't.

**Speaker A:** Understand that. Well, even if they do understand it, they still don't practice it.

**Speaker G:** Well, this is true, I'll give you that. Credit where credit is due, and the utmost respect where it.

**Speaker A:** Is due. Well, thank you. So, Mikey, why don't we take this.

**Speaker H:** Thing home? Yeah, thanks, friends, for being here today. Uh, friendly reminder to take it easy, to Take care and enjoy yourselves. Y'all are welcome to stay here. No need to leave.

Only the— the only problems are the ones that we think. We think there's a problem, there's a problem. If we don't think there's a problem, there's no problem. There's no problem. Making sure. Right.

**Speaker G:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker G:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a practical, non-dogmatic interpretation of core Buddhist teachings, moving away from common misconceptions. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Anatta (Not-Self) and the Illusion of Authority**
*   **Anatta is not "no self":** It is a middle way between the extremes of **eternalism** (belief in a permanent soul/God) and **nihilism** (belief in nothingness). It means there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul.
*   **The Authority Delusion:** From childhood, we are conditioned into a hierarchical, "one-up, one-down" mindset—seeing ourselves as victims to authorities (parents, gods, governments, doctors) or pretending to be authorities ourselves. This is a primary source of *dukkha* (suffering).
*   **Reality vs. Storytelling:** In reality, there is no permanent overlord. Life is governed by **cause and effect** (*itthiyapapajjata*). We create suffering by telling ourselves stories (like "I'm not good enough") and clinging to them.

### **The Correct Practice: Investigation and Change**
The Buddha's teaching is presented as a simple, ongoing practice of investigation, not passive belief or complex meditation techniques.
1.  **Investigate:** Continuously examine the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness**—body, feelings, mental states, and thoughts—as they are, right on the surface.
2.  **Look & See:** Notice what is happening in the present moment, especially the quality of your thoughts.
3.  **Change:** Actively change unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones. This is not about digging deep into the psyche, but changing the thought that is present *right now*.
4.  **Gladden the Mind / Congratulate Yourself:** Shift your attitude from that of a victim ("This is hard") to that of a winner ("I can do this"). This builds confidence (*prajna*) and leads to feelings of being **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied**.

### **Key Corrections to Common Misconceptions**
*   **Samadhi** is **unification of mind** (bringing body, feelings, and mind into harmony), not intense concentration on a single object.
*   **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is not about focusing on the nostrils, but using the breath as a tool for this broader investigation and unification.
*   **"Vipassana"** as a special "insight" technique is not emphasized in the early suttas. The Buddha simply taught to "investigate and see."
*   **Meditation Retreats & Gurus:** Formal, intensive retreats are a modern invention. The Buddha taught to practice in daily life—"go to the foot of a tree" and look at what's happening. Teachers/authorities cannot do the work for you.

### **Practical Examples and Metaphors**
*   **The Cowherd (Sutta 119):** The mind is like a cow that wanders. At first, you must diligently guard and correct it (change unwholesome thoughts). With practice, it stays peacefully in the "pasture" of sustained wholesome thinking.
*   **Dealing with Chronic Pain:** The problem is not the sensation of pain, but the **aversion** to it ("I don't like this"). The practice is to notice the pain, notice the aversion, change the thought to "I am safe and okay even with this sensation," and then congratulate yourself for doing so.
*   **Unnecessary Planning:** Thinking about a future task (like going to the bank) repeatedly is an unwholesome hindrance. A wholesome thought is: "I've prepared what I need. Right now, I don't have to go, and everything is okay."

### **Conclusion: The Path is Simple and Direct**
The entire teaching is summarized as: **Remember to look, see what's there, change it for the better, and gladden your mind.** This unremitting practice, like repeatedly striking a drum, leads to skill and well-being. The goal is not to find deep philosophical answers, but to cultivate a good life free from self-created suffering by changing your thoughts and attitude in the present moment.

**Final Advice:** "Don't worry, be happy." The only problems are the ones we think exist. If we don't think there's a problem, there's no problem.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and the practice of mindfulness. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors**

**a. The Guest in the Body**  
- **Metaphor**: You are a **guest in your own body**, not the owner.  
- **Purpose**: To illustrate *anatta* (not-self) and impermanence. The body is like a temporary house that will eventually “fall down,” but there’s no permanent “landlord” (soul/self) to evict you.

**b. The Cowherd and the Cows** (from Sutta 119)  
- **Metaphor**: The mind is like **cows**, and the meditator is the **cowherd** with a stick.  
- **Purpose**: To explain mindfulness practice. When thoughts (cows) stray into unwholesome territory (e.g., greed, ill will), you gently “whack” them back to the wholesome “pasture.” Once the mind is settled, you can watch without force.

**c. The Drum**  
- **Metaphor**: Meditation is like **striking a drum repeatedly** (tap, tap, tap), not holding the mallet down.  
- **Purpose**: To emphasize that mindfulness requires **moment-to-moment effort**, not sustained, rigid concentration. It’s a rhythmic, ongoing practice.

**d. The Bank**  
- **Metaphor**: Planning a trip to the bank **100 times in your head** before going.  
- **Purpose**: To show how most thoughts are unnecessary “hindrances.” We rehearse actions mentally instead of being present. Wholesome thinking means: “I’ve prepared; now I can relax until it’s time to act.”

**e. The Sky God (Zeus/Jupiter)**  
- **Metaphor**: Ancient people attributed lightning to **Zeus throwing a trident**.  
- **Purpose**: To criticize “eternalism” and blind faith in authority figures (gods, priests, doctors). Reality is cause and effect, not supernatural control.

**f. The Math Class**  
- **Metaphor**: Listening to a math teacher isn’t enough; you must **do the problems yourself**.  
- **Purpose**: To stress that Buddhist practice requires personal investigation, not passive following of a teacher.

---

### **2. Stories/Anecdotes**

**a. Family Longevity vs. Medical Advice**  
- **Story**: The speaker’s fat great-grandmother lived to 103, and other overweight relatives lived past 100, while a thin aunt died young. Also, George Burns smoked and drank but lived past 100.  
- **Purpose**: To challenge blind trust in authority (e.g., medical rules about weight/smoking). Encourages investigating your own body rather than relying on external “rules.”

**b. The Beverly Hillbillies and the Common Cold**  
- **Story**: Granny’s “remedy” cures a cold in two weeks—but colds go away on their own in two weeks anyway.  
- **Purpose**: To point out how we credit authorities for “cures” that are just natural processes.

**c. Depression Study (1970s)**  
- **Story**: A study found **exercise** more effective for depression than pills or talk therapy.  
- **Purpose**: To show that real change comes from **your own actions**, not external authorities (psychiatrists/psychologists).

**d. Constantine and Christianity**  
- **Story**: Constantine made Christianity Rome’s state religion in the 4th century, using it to consolidate power.  
- **Purpose**: To illustrate how religions can become tools of control, promoting the “authority delusion” the Buddha warned against.

**e. The Buddha vs. His Disciples**  
- **Story**: After the Buddha’s death, Ananda tells a Brahmin that the Buddha’s senior students were like him—except the Buddha **figured it out on his own**.  
- **Purpose**: To highlight that the Buddha’s key contribution was discovering the path through investigation; everyone else must **practice it themselves**.

---

### **3. Recurring Analogies**

- **Hierarchy/Authority as Illusion**: We are conditioned to see life as a **one-up/one-down system** (victim vs. authority), but nature operates on **cause and effect**, not hierarchy.
- **Thoughts as Surface-Level**: The mind’s habits are **not deep, buried problems** (as in psychology) but **surface thoughts** we can change immediately.
- **Unwholesome vs. Wholesome Thoughts**: Like training cows, we redirect thoughts from greed/ill-will to contentment/safety.

---

### **Summary**
The speaker uses **everyday metaphors** (guest, cowherd, drum, bank) and **historical/personal stories** to demystify Buddhist concepts like *anatta*, mindfulness, and non-reliance on authority. The core message: **Investigate your present experience, change unwholesome thoughts, and cultivate a “winner’s attitude” through continuous practice.**
