### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There we go. All right, so repeat that last question.

**Speaker B:** Why do we— I'm trying to think of how to better phrase it— but why do we desire one state or another to begin with? Like, I understand why the borders get drawn. From a young age, we get banged into often enough that this thing ignorantly starts to throw up lines and walls and such. And oh, this is over here and this is over here and that's over there.

**Speaker A:** But we construct a framework for our reality that is basically what we can say is, is that we as humans are capable of understanding the nature of reality in the sense that we can remember a whole lot better. Dogs, for instance, don't know death. They can see a dead animal and it doesn't register me next, right? Okay, so there's— so that's what humans have, so that the kind of world that we live in is constructed differently. And so we live in a different reality than the dogs do, but actually we're more refined than that because each individual person has their own individual view, uh, our version of reality. And it's almost like our own personal all-big, uh, point of view. We can call it a worldview. Yeah. And the reason that we do that is because not having one makes things terrifying.

**Speaker B:** Oh, because if we can't figure out where it belongs, then it's scary to us.

**Speaker A:** You're right, because it might be dangerous. This is the whole point about doubt, is that doubt brings on that fear of, well, what if I can't figure it out? Okay, I can't put it into my worldview.

**Speaker B:** And this brings about anger, fear, all.

**Speaker A:** Kinds of possibilities, desire, yeah, including wakening up. To this whole worldview thing that we have, this constructed reality. We can call it concepts. That in fact, yeah, right now we're talking about it in a kind of conglomerate overall way of a worldview, but normally we speak of it in the sense of the various pieces and parts. So in fact, instead of talking about the whole castle, we talk about moats, we talk about drawbridges and things like that. And we need to draw back and recognizing that what we're really talking about is that all that, those rights, rules, rituals, and everything like that, is what the scaffolding or the framework is for the construction of my worldview.

**Speaker B:** How amazing that that goes both ways, that it can put us into a scary corner but it can wake us up, right?

**Speaker A:** But the scary corner is when we're doing it with instinct, right? Because our constructed reality and the faults with it is very much like the constructed reality that the alligator lives with when he's being picked up by a huge crane and about to get eaten. Not supposed to be that way. Alligators are the ones who eat cranes, buddy. Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Animals construct realities about how things ought to be and should be. They just don't have such a long list as us humans, right? Okay, so you could actually then think about this worldview that we have as a structure— means that the rules of the architectural drawings.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is why we want to start looking at the rules, especially as they come up right now, because we have to look at the architectural drawing in order to fill in this space of my worldview, right? And we go around basically trying to protect our worldview. In a way, every argument is putting your whole worldview out on display and under attack.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Because if they can find one little tiny little place in my worldview, the whole thing will collapse with me.

**Speaker B:** It's all connected.

**Speaker A:** Because it's all connected and it's all imaginary anyway. And somehow at a deep level, we know that.

**Speaker B:** So then I guess the question I have too is, why do we desire awakening? Does that make sense? Well, because in my mind, the way—.

**Speaker A:** No, no, wait a minute. We put that as part of the rules. Why do we— we don't desire awakening, but we do desire, and it's uncomfortable as hell, and we don't like it, and we want out of that desire, except that we don't recognize that circle we've gotten ourselves into. Okay, we want out, basically.

**Speaker B:** Of desire and aversion, of craving?

**Speaker A:** No, that's what you add to it. That's what the actual deep level fear, or the deep level feeling, is what we want to escape from. Oh, we don't like being afraid. Oh, we don't like it. No, no, it's true that it not only is dangerous in the sense of anxiety attacks that are unnecessary, or lying to the police unnecessarily, and then you're in really big trouble, all of that kind of big stuff. Or even at the biological level, people who are filled with fear often have ailments. Yes, it in fact stresses the Anagami, the most hung up about sex, and think about it so much of the time. Wind up with prostate cancer.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right.

**Speaker A:** Hence I offer you the Catholic priest. They're famous for having prostate cancer.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. They're also famous for restricting.

**Speaker A:** All right, so in going on with that, we don't also like fear because it— the fear itself is a signal for danger, that in fact it is the self-preservation mechanism that is sounding the siren of fear. And it has a whole lot of chemical components that are going in there with, um, um, oh, adrenaline is number one, cortisol, all of those protective kind of things to pump us up, get ready fight or flight.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And that getting us ready for fight or flight is also called a state of freeze. And if an animal freezes too long, they're eaten.

**Speaker B:** Done.

**Speaker A:** And so we have to get past that freeze point. But humans are really good at freezing. Yeah, for years we're not breathing very well, and so we're not able to because of all of the adrenaline and the blood is getting into the body ready to fight or flight. There's not much blood left in the brain to think with. That's when we need it most as humans, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so what we need to do then in the practice of Anapanasati is to start looking at the fear when it's at a very low level and the kind of thoughts that bring it on, because often there's adrenaline pumping going on that most people are not aware of. They're just agitated, and they don't even know that it's because the body is full of these chemicals that are based upon the fact that they're terrified of something or another. In fact, that's exactly why— that's exactly why a whole bunch of police will gang up on some kid and beat the piss out of him, is because they had to chase him down, and that was a lot of work, and I was afraid I was going to lose him. And so now they're absolutely end up with all the fear, and that turns immediately into rage.

**Speaker B:** Yep, right.

**Speaker A:** And so the cop is almost like a gun going off himself.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Whether they have a pistol in their hands or not.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. It doesn't matter about the, uh, the discharge of the weapon. It's that built-up, um, anger, frustration, right? And fear that this guy is going to get away.

**Speaker B:** So when we have a desire for awakening, we have a desire to extinguish fear, to stop having these feelings?

**Speaker A:** Once we wake up to the fact that the problem is the fear and that we need to wake up to it whenever it does occur and tell that child, that little infant, everything's okay— rockabye baby, Lullaby and good night. Everything is okay. You're safe. You're secure. Look at what's going on. Okay, so this is the way we begin to train ourselves, is to see that fear, because those fears came from something unwholesome. We could almost define as what makes a thought unwholesome is, is that it's got terror built in as part of the seed of it.

**Speaker B:** Wow, right. What a good distinction.

**Speaker A:** All right, so a wholesome thought is going to be a soothing, gentle thought. Okay, that everything is okay, that's the wholesome. And you generally— the reality is that's how it is.

**Speaker B:** It's okay. Yeah, right. Even when things don't seem like they should be okay, they're more likely than not more okay than you think they are.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Well, here's the point: how often do you actually get chased by the police or any number of other things to save your life? That doesn't happen very often.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** But how often do we feel like that's what's happening, right? Way too often. Way too often, right? Right. And so we're not living in a real reality of actually having to run away from the police and being chased, but we feel like things are that dangerous, right, when in fact it's not.

**Speaker B:** Even simple, simple things can fire that up.

**Speaker A:** This is the state of us being human and still with this animal thing that is called the instincts, the self-preservation instincts, the old programming that was given to us as humans as a gift from whatever was before us. And it looks like that those guys had some stuff going for them. I've even mentioned, I think, to you about fire and dogs could have been given to humans before humans existed, that it was part of the heritage that came down.

**Speaker B:** One would think so. Certainly been around, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Because without humans being born as a species already eating cooked food, right? Right. So who taught us how to cook food? Mommy and Daddy, who were not quite human. And sometimes we recognize that even at home. These people are not actually human. I'm the human here. And that's true because every generation we become more human, right? And parents are afraid of losing control because in fact they do. Yes, because the next generation of kids are smarter than us, right? And we don't want to give them that credit, right?

**Speaker B:** Interesting. So, here's a question about Paticcasamuppada. We know this is the way that things happen, you know, this exists so that exists, this doesn't exist so that does not exist. Where in the links, in— are they Nadanyas, is that how you say it?

**Speaker A:** I don't know, I don't know the word you said.

**Speaker B:** The 12 links. Where in the 12 links is volition? Where is will? Where is, uh, for example, when I change an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought?

**Speaker A:** From feelings, the will to want. Okay, I like it is the feeling, I want it is the will, clinging is the full-blown will. It winds up often being disappointed. So, we have Vedana, the feelings, then we have Tanha, the beginning of will, then the full-blown will, but the surprise is that the self and the will at that level are deeply connected. In fact, you could have asked, is that where the self comes from? But you asked the will. But it's the same thing, right? Okay, self-preservation, the will to live, the will to strive, the will to go get what I want.

**Speaker B:** So what are karmic propensities? Where do they fit into that chain?

**Speaker A:** That's just another word. That's just another word for habit.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so where does the habit— does it just shorten the amount of time?

**Speaker A:** From the old actions.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and this is what sense impressions do, is when they make an impression on our mental continuum, they bring about a patterning.

**Speaker A:** Maybe we can give you this little phrase, okay? Thoughts and feelings run tighter circles around each other, and that will bring rise to voice, that we will say it, that almost always every criminal will threaten before he does it. Okay, that in fact cobras stand up and wiggle around right before they strike. You know they're about to strike before they actually strike because they'll signal that. Okay, this is what we're meaning, is, is that we make a voice or we sound it out. Whatever we say as humans then will become our actions. So we'll actually go out do the axe murder that we warned somebody that we were going to do because that was what we were thinking about, or whatever it is. Okay, right. So with actions repeated, because all of this stuff is on a roll, this is all Samsara wheels of doing it, and you keep doing it, it becomes a habit. Yes, like smoking cigarettes. The first time a kid smokes a cigarette, they hate it. Every one of us hate that first cigarette.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I smoked for, what, 20-something years, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the first one you hated.

**Speaker B:** Didn't like it. Yeah, tastes bad.

**Speaker A:** But you kept doing it until you got used to it, and then you became addicted to it. That's the habit, right? Right. Okay, very much. And then, and then the big surprise is, is that our habits lead to our destiny.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Who we are, then the destiny, who you're destined to be, your personality is nothing but a pattern of habits that you quit smoking. Huh?

**Speaker B:** Who is it that quits smoking?

**Speaker A:** The one who— the wisdom. Okay, so we can say now we're adding wisdom to the thing. We can see the dangers are real in this direction, and I've been paying attention by being afraid of things that happened in this direction, which would be like the present moment. Well, wisdom gives us the ability to see dangers ahead so that we can take actions now to avoid them.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and this is going against like.

**Speaker A:** Every Automobile accident, almost every one of them would be prevented if people were watching where they were going and saw what was happening. The trailers would not jackknife if the driver is skilled enough to know what it's like before the car or the truck jackknifes, so that he doesn't put it in that situation. Okay, so this is all about wisdom, which means this is the actual awakening. Is that we start paying attention to reality right here, right now, and pretty darn quick at it, rather than keep trying to make sense out of it, understand it, put it into our worldview, figure out whether we agree with it or not, etc., and all of that kind of stuff. So then the feelings arise. Well, we don't need any feelings. What we need is to look.

**Speaker B:** Look at the contact.

**Speaker A:** Look at what's going on. Use your wisdom eye. See how things are going, the trajectory. The example that I used— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Do we ever actually see anything other than what the mind throws up? So for example, I watch a bird, or I watch this finger. Well, I'm watching the finger on the phone, but you know what I'm saying. But I'm not watching the finger.

**Speaker A:** I'm.

**Speaker B:** Watching what the mind creates after it takes in a bunch of light bouncing around, right?

**Speaker A:** If we even know that there's light.

**Speaker B:** But we don't even know that there's light. The light could be of the mind.

**Speaker A:** All right, let me put it like this for you, is that that's the best part of being human is that we can figure out the trajectories of that bird. Okay, now there's roots of that in the sense of, let us say, a bird and a snake are fighting with each other, and they're watching closely the movements of each other so that they can anticipate it and meet them. So as the bird flies up the snake jumps up also, right? Okay, so they already have a very primitive version of this. Humans, because of our large capacity for being able to receive data and keep track of a lot of it— we're not doing it very well, computers now are better at remembering things than humans— but we've got a lot of it ahead of the animals, right? And because of that, we put things that way so that our wisdom means that we can see the dots. Even if the dots are happening once a week or once a month, we can put it together. Just like Galileo was able to figure out the projections of the— well, of the moons, and then got to the orbits of the planets, is because he kept looking at it and meticulously measuring And he figured that stuff out and proved the entire church and everybody else wrong, and they hated him for that, right? Why?

**Speaker B:** Why are we scared to be separate and together?

**Speaker A:** It didn't fit into their worldview, okay? And people get terrified when they lose their worldview. What do you— I mean, it's almost like when he said that, it's almost like the heavens themselves are falling. I mean, Chicken Little, the sky is falling. That's what happened to the Catholic Church when Galileo came by, right? Their whole cosmos was destroyed right in front of them.

**Speaker B:** But okay, so here's a question. In that tradition, for example, there are contemplatives that have these realizations. Is it simply because they call it God that they're not terrified?

**Speaker A:** Actually, each individual person uses their own internal language. Sometimes it's pre-verbal, but an experience is just an experience. Okay, but sometimes an experience can really give us some information we need, right? Example of that is walking into the kitchen and having a conversation with somebody, and you put your hand down on the stove because you're know that it's off, and you get a scorching reception and you burned your hand. And then you recognize from now on you're going to be careful of that stove, right? Okay, walking into fire, getting injured is a big wake-up call for us, and we remember that stuff. That in fact, we remember the most dangerous things that have ever happened to us are the things that we remember the most. The times when times were tight. The example that I will often use is little Johnny is writing on the wall with crayons, white wall in his bedroom, and his mother comes in and catches him. Now she's got two choices. One is she can compliment him on being a budding Picasso and get him some good art equipment, or she can raise Cain about the landlord and painting wall and this kind of stuff, you know, which is where most of them go. And so now little Johnny, when he remembers that, he's going to remember getting fussed at. He's not going to remember how much fun it was to actually do the drawing, right? That's the way the human mind works. It doesn't work that 100% of the time, but that's the basic way is that the self-preservation instinct wants to make sure that we're going to avoid danger. That's what the whole point about staying alive is all about, is to stay out of danger. And not we, but I.

**Speaker B:** So what of altruism? Is this a short-circuiting of this?

**Speaker A:** Well, what we're actually looking for— pointing Actually, it means that we're bringing wisdom into our selfishness. We're bringing wisdom in that I'm not alone, that I've got friends here, that they treat my friends the way I want to treat myself. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Why is that comforting?

**Speaker A:** Why not comfort yourself? I mean, that's what the whole part of Anapanasati is all about, is to stop being afraid. Because often when we're afraid, we're afraid of those people out there. And when we're no longer afraid, we're not afraid of those people. They're our friends now.

**Speaker B:** When I think about what I'm afraid of the most The thing I'm afraid of the most, I think, is being alone.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can't do that.

**Speaker B:** Can't be afraid or can't be alone?

**Speaker A:** You can't be alone. Yeah, even when you're in the solitary cell in a prison, that's about it in our Western imagination, how alone you can get. Or perhaps alone in the desert, but that's a different situation because that's downright dangerous. The desert itself alone has got nothing to do with it. Where's that drink of water? But if you're in the prison cell, you're not going to be alone. I mean, if you leave the food out, you're going to have a mouse or a rat, or at least some cockroaches, you can have a party, you can feed them. In fact, that's quite common for people in prisons, for a guy to have a pet mouse or a pet rat. Sometimes the pet rat saves a guy's life for some reason or another, like jumping in the shirt of the guy who's about to beat him up or something like that.

**Speaker B:** Yes, of course.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so being alone then is still a mental state, right? Not a reality.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** And if you're in still, they don't, don't do the 20— they taught it 23 hours. At least you have an hour. You can be nice to the guards. You can say thank you when they serve the grub. You compliment them on doing such a good job and taking care of you all so you have some peace and quiet.

**Speaker B:** That's wonderful.

**Speaker A:** As you're saying, but as you're thinking now, we can recognize that your fear of being alone is a construction that you've made up because you have not ever been in a situation where you were alone.

**Speaker B:** Correct.

**Speaker A:** So you're afraid of something that you've never seen and doesn't exist. And quite likely to not ever exist, right? And if you make friends with yourself, then it doesn't matter. You can be alone because you got friends. And the better part of it is, is that if you're friends with other people, they won't leave you alone. Yes, amazing. And so see, there's nothing to be afraid of. So now your worst fear is just right out the door, right? What a relief that is to recognize that the number one feeling was irrelevant all along.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that is very relieving. That is very good.

**Speaker A:** I just, I just talked myself into feeling afraid when there was nothing to fear except fear itself. I don't know where Churchill got that expression but he was so spot on.

**Speaker B:** That's— he was pretty brilliant with it, wasn't he?

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** He talked about his depression as a little black dog that followed him around. It's nice to sit and feel okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, feeling okay. That's, that's what this practice is all about, is to recognize that I don't have to fear anything, right? What a relief that is.

**Speaker B:** I mean, like you said, we can get so much done. Done with fear is done enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've got time. I've got time, tons of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, right now I do.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that was something I thought on I wanted to ask you about as well. This is another rule that we have, this time thing. Yes. Oh, so when I look at my present experience, anything that happens to do with the future is happening now. Anything that happens to do with the past is happening now. But anything that's happening now is also happening now, but it's only dependent on the other two times existing, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** No, those two times don't exist, except in your imagination. You made them up, right? Okay, you stored that stuff away not very well, and you retrieved it not very well, and you think it was all real. And in fact, the past is dead. You can't pick it back up. A cup is broken, is broken, period. But until the scientists, or perhaps neuroscientists, figure out how we can turn the clock backwards, we're just going to have to be content that it rolls the way that it does— cause and effect rather than effect and cause. But a lot of people want it to be the other way around. In fact, I just saw you do that.

**Speaker B:** You see, I want to know.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I thought it was before, but maybe it was something with Kishon earlier today. But in any case, um, yes, we do. We confuse cause and effect. You can in fact say that wisdom is being able to correctly see cause and effect, because then you can see this stuff causing over here, and you can recommend Anagami, or you could recognize, I wonder when the effect is going to take hold.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. So is there any point in looking for the cause, or is there only a point in looking now?

**Speaker A:** Well, looking to see what is, and pretty soon as humans we begin to make these connections.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, this is the whole set of connections that we're talking about here. Was when the Buddha figured out, aha, I see you. That's where he was able to put the whole thing of Paticcasamuppada together. And so by doing that, we're quite grateful because I could not have put 2 and 2 together, and he's put 1 to 12 together, and that was brilliant. That it may not be perfect, but it certainly fulfills the service. It's serviceable.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very much.

**Speaker A:** And no other tradition that I know of, it has quite that serviceability as the teaching actually of the Buddha. Not many different Buddhist groups here and there, and not psychology— I've been down that path— not in engineering, though they've got a whole lot of good stuff going going for them. At least the engineers can put a building up and keep their house from going on fire. And if they knew how to put their engineering skills together and start looking at their own mind, they wouldn't put their own internal house on fire either.

**Speaker B:** Very true.

**Speaker A:** They know how to wire it up.

**Speaker B:** So is that part of what we're doing here, is we're rearranging Right, we'll.

**Speaker A:** Stop going by old assumptions, okay, that we made as children instinctively, right? And start rebuilding our world as best we can that actually fits reality.

**Speaker B:** That reality is everything goes together, there's nothing that goes apart. But this is a paradise. This is a paradise.

**Speaker A:** This isn't for everybody who's out looking for a paradise, is destroying the one they've got, right? Uh, because they're trying to fix it and repair it instead of allowing it to be hunky-dory just the way it is. Things are all right already. The big problem was, is that I was afraid when things were all right already. And because I was afraid, I had to go find out how I could fix things so I wouldn't be afraid anymore. And that was the basic mistake of humanity. Yeah, basic mistake we make is we want to go fix things so that I'll feel safe, rather than seeing that things are safe. It's okay to feel safe.

**Speaker B:** Now, that's an early Judea.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point.

**Speaker B:** Yes, to feel safe. To feel okay.

**Speaker A:** Well, no, that the basic mistake is that people think they have to go fix things so that they can feel safe. They've been— rather than— and so they spend all our time making traps and features and all of that kind of stuff to try to fix reality, when in fact if we would investigate it closely, we'd see that it was already safe and that it was okay to feel safe. Yeah, without having to fix it, because it ain't broken.

**Speaker B:** So what causes us to feel safe? Is it wisdom?

**Speaker A:** Again, is to recognize, to investigate, and to see that there is no reason to be afraid, and we can let our guard down. Everything really is all right. Relax, take a rest already. We see that with puppies. Yeah, but in fact, I've seen films of abandoned puppies that were absolutely terrified of everything, and somehow the owner got a hold of the puppy, and after feeding them and drying off, a few hours later, the puppy's actually going to be taking a nap on her chest. But not while he was terrified. He had to see that things were okay. We'll see out in the rain on the road, it was terrifying, right? But in this nice lady's lap with the milk and all, warm and everything. So even puppies can see reality. It's humans who can't. You won't trust this woman, right? Right.

**Speaker B:** So danger, real— like, let's say, let's not say danger, real danger, no real danger.

**Speaker A:** Let's say you almost— in your life, you can recommend, or you can recognize, you almost never have any real danger. I mean, when was the last time you were actually in real danger? When was the last time you got robbed? When was the last time you got busted? Not just stopped for a check, but actually— but it's been so long. I mean, how many years has it been since you were on the battlefield?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's been— and that's been a decade plus.

**Speaker A:** All right, right. But you know, there are guys who still have PTSD, which means they still think they're on the battlefield. They haven't figured out that they're safe yet.

**Speaker B:** But we were safe on the battlefield as well, in my mind now when I look back at it. In a very ultimate sense, there was no need even then to fear what was happening. There was only a need to do what needed to be done. And had anything happened— well, that makes.

**Speaker A:** One a good soldier though, right? Okay. As opposed to a Buddhist philosopher who will say he sees what's going on and— excuse me, I'm going to the toilet in New Jersey. I'm going to go find someplace that's safe, really safe, right?

**Speaker B:** So, hmm. So when we talk about birth and.

**Speaker A:** Death, I'm not sure there are toilets in New Jersey that are safe. Relatively safer.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure. At least not so hot and stinky. Porta-potties in 130-degree heat smell bad.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. And that's also the point of being able to get comfortable. That's what the whole quality of safe, secure, and comfortable are about. We have to get ourselves into a safe place, right? Because we know, at least intellectually, that we are either in a safe place or not. And it's been kind of a little joke to tease the students about— there's no bears in your closet, there's no alligators on the floor. Okay, so since we are in fact actually alone, at least for the moment, Let's take advantage of it, right? So I've got a call coming in. We'll finish this one and then I'll get back with him.

**Speaker B:** That sounds great.

**Speaker A:** Um, so anyway, this point that we were making is actually the good place to to go with this is that it is the fear. And the fears that we're talking about are the unfounded fears that come out of our deep past through our genes that kept us alive. And in fact, our fear often keeps us alive in this life. I mean, those daredevils would do even more daredevilish stuff and get so many more of them killed if nobody were afraid. In fact, the fear is what makes it spectacular anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right, makes it something to look at, a spectacle.

**Speaker A:** So it really has a lot to do with fear. And when you recognize that, oh, that's the number one feeling that we should be paying attention to— do I feel uneasy or uncomfortable in any way? Let me go back and get myself into a state of feeling comfortable. Safe and secure.

**Speaker B:** Like that.

**Speaker A:** Just like that. Or at least within a few breaths.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe one or two, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, one or two or three. Or in fact, when we get into the rhythm of really liking the breath, then we've forgotten all about where's the fear, because we're having trouble about counting. Yeah, everything is okay. All right, so This is the way that we can deal with the fear, is to remove it, is by not giving it much of anything. We give it no do juice, and, and we take, um, uh, the focus and attention off of it and let it subside. That we, in fact, we created the fear. We're just not sure of how we did that. But watch closely, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** We'll figure it out.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, we'll figure it out. We'll see it. Right now the job to do is relax, right?

**Speaker B:** Let it go.

**Speaker A:** Let that little puppy go ahead and take a nap, right? No problem, everything is solved.

**Speaker B:** Okay, wonderful.

**Speaker A:** So we'll finish now. I have some other stuff that I want to talk to you about, but I've got, uh, actually it's going to he's calling and I want to get with him.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** So much love, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** This has been really great. Thank you. It has. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Tokimasito. I said hello.

**Speaker A:** All right. All right.

**Speaker B:** I'll talk to you soon, my friend.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), explores the core human problem of fear and the constructed "worldview" we create to manage it, ultimately pointing toward awakening as the solution. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **Core Problem: The Constructed Worldview & Fear**
*   Humans, unlike animals, construct a complex personal **worldview**—a framework of concepts, rules, and expectations—to make sense of reality.
*   This construction is driven by a deep, instinctual **fear** of the unknown and the need for self-preservation. We fear anything that doesn't fit into our worldview, as it feels dangerous and destabilizing.
*   This low-grade, often unconscious fear is the seed of unwholesome states (anger, agitation, craving) and is chemically sustained by adrenaline and cortisol. It can freeze us, cloud our thinking, and lead to reactive behaviors (e.g., police violence born of fear and frustration).

### **The Desire for Awakening**
*   We don't fundamentally desire "awakening" as an abstract goal. Instead, we desire **freedom from the discomfort of fear and craving**. Awakening is the natural result of addressing this root cause.
*   The path involves **waking up to the fact that the problem is fear itself** and learning to soothe it in the present moment.

### **The Practice: Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) & Investigation**
*   The practice is to **recognize fear at a low level**—the underlying agitation and unease—and to **calm it by shifting to wholesome, soothing thoughts**.
*   Through mindfulness, we investigate the **links in our experience** (referencing *Paticcasamuppada*, Dependent Origination):
    *   Feelings (*vedana*) lead to craving/will (*tanha*), which leads to clinging and habitual actions.
    *   Repeated actions form **habits** (karmic propensities), and these habits shape our character and destiny.
*   **Wisdom** (*pañña*) is the key that interrupts this chain. It allows us to see the trajectory of cause and effect clearly, choose differently, and break unwholesome habits.

### **Key Insights and Reframes**
1.  **Reality is Safer Than We Think:** Our fear is often disproportionate. True, immediate physical danger is rare, yet we constantly feel under threat. The insight is that **things are fundamentally okay already**; we don't need to "fix" reality to feel safe.
2.  **Fear is Often Unfounded:** Our deepest fears (e.g., of being alone) are often mental constructions, not reflections of reality. By making friends with ourselves and others, these fears dissolve.
3.  **Time is a Mental Construct:** Past and future exist only in imagination. Wisdom is found in seeing **cause and effect clearly in the present moment**.
4.  **The Goal is to Feel Safe, Secure, and Comfortable:** The practice aims at a direct, embodied sense of well-being. By relaxing and letting go of fear—"giving it no juice"—we allow the natural state of peace to emerge.
5.  **Altruism is Wise Self-Interest:** Recognizing our interconnectedness, being kind to others is an extension of the wisdom that seeks peace for oneself. When we are not afraid, we see others as friends.

### **Conclusion**
The talk culminates in a simple, powerful instruction: The primary task is to **relax and let go of fear** in the present moment. By continually returning to a state of safety and comfort (exemplified by calming the breath), we deconstruct the fearful worldview and discover that **"everything is all right already."** Awakening is not about acquiring something new, but about ceasing to create unnecessary fear and seeing the inherent safety and interconnectedness of reality.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the speakers use several **metaphors** and **stories** to explain the nature of the mind, fear, and awakening:

---

### **Metaphors**

1. **Worldview as a Castle or Structure**  
   - Speaker A describes our constructed reality as a “worldview,” comparing it to a **castle** with **moats, drawbridges, scaffolding, and architectural drawings**.  
   - The idea is that we build mental structures (rules, rituals, beliefs) to feel safe, and we defend them as if defending a fortress.

2. **Worldview as a Fragile, Interconnected System**  
   - He says if one small part of the worldview is attacked, “the whole thing will collapse like a house of cards” — emphasizing its interconnected and imaginary nature.

3. **Fear and Instinct as Animal Programming**  
   - The **alligator being lifted by a crane** is used to illustrate how animals (and humans) have instinctual “constructed realities” about how things should be. When reality contradicts that, it causes terror.  
   - **Cobras signaling before they strike** is another animal metaphor for how thoughts/feelings lead to actions.

4. **Fear as a Chemical/Alarm System**  
   - Fear is described in terms of **adrenaline, cortisol, fight-or-flight response**, and the **freeze state** — like an animal freezing too long and getting eaten.

5. **Police and Rage as a “Gun Going Off”**  
   - The buildup of fear in police chasing a suspect turns into rage — they become like **a gun discharging** — illustrating how fear transforms into uncontrolled action.

6. **Thoughts as Seeds with Terror**  
   - Unwholesome thoughts have **terror built into them as a seed**; wholesome thoughts are **soothing and gentle**.

7. **Habit as Addiction**  
   - The **habit of smoking cigarettes** (starting with dislike, then addiction) is used to explain how repeated actions form karmic patterns leading to destiny.

8. **Wisdom as Seeing Trajectories/Dots**  
   - Wisdom is compared to **connecting dots over time** (like Galileo figuring out planetary motion) or **seeing the trajectory of a bird** to anticipate where it will go.

9. **The Mind as a Badly Wired House**  
   - Engineers who can build safe houses but might “**put their own internal house on fire**” if they don’t apply the same scrutiny to their minds.

10. **The Past as Dead/Broken**  
    - The past is **a broken cup** — it can’t be fixed or reclaimed, only imagined.

---

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1. **Galileo vs. the Church**  
   - Used to show how new knowledge can shatter a worldview, causing terror — like “the sky is falling” in *Chicken Little*.

2. **Child Drawing on the Wall**  
   - Little Johnny drawing with crayons on a white wall: the mother’s reaction (anger vs. encouragement) shapes what the child remembers — the **self-preservation instinct remembers danger more than joy**.

3. **Abandoned Puppy**  
   - A story of an abandoned, terrified puppy that, after being rescued, fed, and warmed, falls asleep on the rescuer’s chest — illustrating that **safety is perceivable and fear can dissolve** when real conditions are safe.

4. **Prisoner with a Pet Rat**  
   - Even in solitary confinement, one is never truly alone — a prisoner might make friends with a mouse or rat, showing that “being alone” is a mental construct.

5. **Soldier with PTSD**  
   - Someone who still feels on the battlefield years later — showing how fear can persist long after real danger is gone.

6. **Churchill’s “Black Dog”**  
   - Mentioned briefly — Churchill’s metaphor for depression as a “little black dog” that follows him.

---

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
- **Construction/Architecture**: worldview, scaffolding, blueprints, building, repairing.
- **Animals**: alligator, cobra, puppy, bird vs. snake — to illustrate instinct and perception.
- **War/Battle**: defending worldview, soldiers, police, battlefield PTSD.
- **Mechanical/Electrical**: wiring, discharging, triggers, chemical pumps.
- **Containers/Structures**: castle, house, prison cell — for the self or mind.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the mind as a **defensive, fear-driven structure** that can be understood and relaxed through wisdom and mindful investigation.
