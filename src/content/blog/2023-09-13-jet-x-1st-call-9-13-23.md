### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Jet, welcome. I'm glad to meet you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks for taking time of your day to help me.

**Speaker A:** We just started talking, um, and immediately, uh, stumbled right into the, uh, the main topic that is in everybody's life. Everybody is dissatisfied and they're trying to find satisfaction someplace. There is nothing else to it. So we think we're going to be satisfied if we get a girl, and she thinks she's going to get satisfied when she gets a man. But what— but neither one of them are satisfied for long, and they start making demands upon each other. And sometimes when a guy can't get a girl, he buys a car. They call it a chick magnet. And so here we are going around and around in the sense of, if we want to go from A to C, we go to B and D and F and G and all kinds of places trying to get back to the original point. And that is that we want to find satisfaction. And this is what the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is all about, is how to find satisfaction. And when one is really satisfied with one's life, then that can be called enlightenment. But everybody's got an idea of what enlightenment is, and it's often a magical idea, because there's a lot of magical thinking in humans. And part of that is, is that, oh, if I could get magic, then I would be satisfied. If I could get power, I would be satisfied. The power of money, the power of force, or the power of magic and all of that. We seek power because we think that we're going to be satisfied. And basically all we do is we hurt ourselves and hurt others, and then they want to hurt us back because they want satisfaction out of the revenge. And so around and around humans go because we are not taking the direct path to satisfaction. And that's what the actual practice is. Now, we'll make a point about the word meditation, that in fact I would go so far as to say I'm not a meditation teacher. I don't teach meditation. I teach the Dhamma. And I teach to practice the Dharma, and that practicing over and over again, to do it again and again, to rinse and repeat and repeat and repeat— that's the clue. That anytime you find yourself in dissatisfaction, which is going to be quite often for a while, you immediately change that from being dissatisfied into satisfied. And I'm going to show you how to do that in a moment. But that's the whole point, that in fact in the Pali language, or actually the language of the Suttas, Magadhi, that they call Pali, is he says Dukkha, Dukkha Rodha, that that's all he teaches. Dukkha is the word for dissatisfaction. Now in Buddhism in the West, it's translated as to suffering. But suffering is a great, great big thing, and when things are really, really big and heavy, they're hard to deal with. But when something is really small, it's much easier to deal with. And so that's what we're going to be looking for, is not the great big dissatisfactions of life, but the little momentary ones, the ones that arise in the mind, our thoughts. And if we are having an unhappy or unwholesome or dissatisfying thought, then we get into a dissatisfied mood, and then the body becomes dissatisfied. We can make ourselves sick with being dissatisfied. But the other way around is, is that we can change that thought from an unwholesome, unsatisfying thought into a satisfying thought. And we can do that with the path. So this whole point about Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, or dissatisfaction turning into satisfaction, is not a long-term process. It's something that happens immediately because it's so lightweight. I mean, you probably already understand that your mind jumps around from one thing to the other, to the other, to the other. In Buddhism, they call that the monkey mind. It's just jumping and jumping and jumping around. So that actually proves on its own that the mind can change. All we have to do is be careful or mindful about which direction the monkey mind is going to jump. So That's the basic point of it. Now, that Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, or dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction, breaks into the Four Noble Truths. And now, dissatisfaction, a lot of people will say that life itself is suffering, life itself is Dukkha, but no, no, life itself is wonderful, it's marvelous. Wouldn't you rather be alive? Than dead? If somebody pulled a gun on you, would you prefer them to use it on you or to not use it on you? All right, to not. So that means that in fact we think life is precious. So it's not life itself that is Dukkha, it's our dissatisfactions with life. Then in fact, much of the dissatisfaction of life is that we think somebody's got a gun pointed at us when in fact no guns there, not in reality. And so basically what the cause of suffering is, is not something on the outside. It's not life itself that's suffering. It's our attitude. It's our belief systems. It's our thought patterns. And most of those thought patterns are ignorant because we're dissatisfied and we don't even know we're dissatisfied. That's amazing, isn't it? The people that are dissatisfied, they don't even know they're dissatisfied. They don't recognize that much of the stuff that they do all day long is to do with being satisfied or not satisfied. And so when you begin to look at it, to see, anytime that you can think of it, you can think of, are you satisfied right now, or are you not? And if you're not, then you can get yourself back into a state of satisfaction, okay? And there's a method for that. So the Four Noble Truths— you've ever heard of the word Four Noble Truths?

**Speaker B:** Heard of it a handful of times, but I don't know what— I don't know the concept of it.

**Speaker A:** Well, I've just been covering it for you, okay? The First Noble Truth is, is that there is dissatisfaction. And number 2 is that we create our dissatisfaction ignorantly. We become dissatisfied and we don't even know that we've become dissatisfied, and we don't know how we got dissatisfied, and we don't know how to get back into a state of satisfaction. And then the third noble truth is that we can become satisfied, it's possible. In fact, often you're satisfied. You become satisfied. I mean, you can take a dish of food and take a bite of it and you like it and you're satisfied right then. And then you think of the bite that you just had and now you're dissatisfied. And then you take another bite and oh, it tastes very good. And so while we're eating a meal, we can go in and out of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. And we don't even know it. We don't even know that we're making those shifts. And so this is the whole point then, is to wake up to these shifts that we're making and begin to control them. That in fact, you can control your life. You can become the boss. You can become the winner of your life, being on top of the world. All you have to do is to figure out how to be satisfied. Mm-hmm. All right, so there is a method to it, and that method is referred to as the Eightfold Noble Path. And that we start with the way that the Buddha started, was that our attitude, or our view, or our way of looking is the first thing that we have to work with. That in fact, you called me because you had already seen that you had some dissatisfactions. Yeah, all right. So that means now at least you're aware of it to a degree, and that we're going to work with that more and more. So the second item on the path is what is called Sati, and it's translated into English as mindfulness. And I think that you've probably heard of the word mindfulness— mindfulness meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and other things like this. So you have heard of the word mindfulness. Well, what it actually— we're looking at here is the Pali word Sati, which actually means to wake up. Wakey, wakey. Let's look at what's going on. Let's remember to be in the present moment rather than thinking about something that happened in the past or planning on the future. Because generally, if we're thinking about the past, it's because we're dissatisfied with the past. And so we want to fix the past, which means now we're off into the future. And life is always lived right here, right now. This breath, this moment is what's real. The past is not real anymore, it's gone. The future is not real, it's yet to be. The reality is only right now. And so coming out of our dissatisfactions about things that are not real into the reality of the moment can be quite satisfying. And so to remember to wake up and look at what we're doing. Now, there's a third element to it: to wake up, look at what you're doing, and make a change right then and there. To wake up, take a look at what you're thinking, and make a change. Wake up, look at your posture, and make a change. Sit up straight, put a smile on. You know, we can do anything like that because we can remember to do it. And if we remember to do it, we can do it. And if we don't remember, we won't. You said you were— or you didn't— yeah, you said you were a fan of Bruce Lee and that you watch a lot of the movies. What would you think of Bruce Lee as if in one of those movies that we pretend is real, that all of a sudden he forgot how to fight? If he forgot how to fight, he can't fight. If he remembers how to fight, he can fight. Well, if you remember to look at what you're doing, you can make a change. And if you don't remember to look at what you're doing, then you get stuck in the old system that's going to bring dissatisfaction. And I bet you didn't even recognize you had that kind of choice.

**Speaker B:** I wasn't aware of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you do. And we— and that's part of the ignorance, is that we're not aware of that. Any choice, we can make a change on about how we feel. We can make a choice about the things that we're thinking about. Okay, so the, uh, this, this point of remembering to make a change, one of the ways the Buddha talks about it is to gladden the mind or to brighten the mind. And we can do that with, with words like, hey, I can handle this. You see, a victim wants to win. A real winner doesn't care whether he wins or not because he's already proven to himself that he's a winner, so he doesn't have to keep proving it. So if you get yourself into a point that you've got to win this argument, or you got to win that score, or whatever like that, if you got to do it, then that's coming out of a state of deprivation or dissatisfaction. 'Oh, I've got to get it in order to feel satisfied.' But if you already have the attitude that you're a winner here and you've got the satisfaction, then you don't have to get into those arguments. Yeah, so Bruce Lee, he can remember how to fight, but often in the movies he doesn't remember how to not fight. And so that's the way that we're going to start working here, is we're going to remember to not fight with ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Okay, hold on one second, my alarm's going upstairs.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, I'll be right back. All right. I'm back. All right. You had to go take care of what?

**Speaker B:** Oh, my alarm was going off.

**Speaker A:** It was kind of— The alarm was going off. Okay, so here we were talking about satisfaction and you were enjoying the conversation and then the alarm went off and you immediately became dissatisfied. Did you recognize that?

**Speaker B:** I guess through the period because I had to go up and kind of interrupt while I was talking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and you don't want that to happen, so you're dissatisfied that the alarm went off. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's a brilliant point right there. Remember that so that you can see that just an alarm going off is going to put you in a state of dissatisfaction. Why is that? It's basically because we've got rules about things, especially in this case you've got a rule about an alarm clock. That the easy thing to have done was to say, "Hey, Dhammarato, can you hear that alarm clock?" And since I can't hear it, it doesn't matter whether it goes off or not for me. But for you, you became dissatisfied when you heard the alarm go off. All right, so that's an intuitive way of looking at what we're talking about. Because you followed your normal way. You did what you always would do. You didn't make a change. You reacted rather than responded. So this whole practice is about seeing those dissatisfactions that we have immediately and then do something new about it.

**Speaker B:** So is it just like kind of just taking a— I guess when the thoughts just start to— those dissatisfying thoughts kind of arise, just take a pause and just consciously, I guess, consciously gliding the mind?

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Hey, I hear that alarm clock go off and it's not going to make me dissatisfied. Okay. And I can— in fact, they don't go for long. So this is the teaching of the Buddha, is that we can, if we can see this dissatisfaction, if we can see the Dukkha, then we can make a change so that we don't have to feel bad, we don't have to have unwholesome thoughts, that we can wake up to it and says, aha, I see you. Aha, I see you, dissatisfaction. I— aha, I see the thought that I had about the alarm clock. Oh, I should— Hello?

**Speaker B:** Hello? It froze for a second.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's because the power went off here. But he came back on. So this is the idea. Aha, I see you. Because what most students do is when they catch that they're dissatisfied, they become dissatisfied with being dissatisfied rather than just never mind that dissatisfaction. Let's come back into the present moment and be happy. That's a trick, because most people, when they see themselves dissatisfied, they'll become dissatisfied with being dissatisfied. Isn't that amazing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like a— this is kind of like a cycle that just feeds itself, whether you choose to or not.

**Speaker A:** So, and people don't wake up to that. So this is part of the way, is to recognize that there is Dukkha there and that you have a choice now about getting out of it rather than keeping in that cycle. All right. An example of that would be there is a famous teacher named Goenka. Oh yeah, he had a phrase. You've heard of him. Okay. So Goenka says when the mind wanders away from the breath, 'Never mind, start again.' And yet many people, when they recognize, when they see, when they wake up to and recognize that their mind has wandered away from the breath, instead of making a change, they start fussing at themselves. 'Oh, meditation is hard. Oh, I wish that I would have a better mind. Oh, this is a monkey mind. Oh, maybe the teacher is not giving good instructions. Oh, I don't know what the problem is.' Okay, and you see that the They're staying in that state of dissatisfaction, rather than, "Hot dog, I caught that one! Let me just start again." So we're going to start to be happy that we can see that we're miserable, because our only choice is to continue being miserable once we find out that we're miserable. Yeah, once we see we're miserable, we have a choice. Once we can see that we're dissatisfied, we can come back and be satisfied. Once we find the mind being in an unwholesome state, its propensity is to stay unwholesome, spinning around in the unwholesome. And as soon as you see it, the thing to do is to jump out of it. Mentally, aha, I see that. Rather than staying in the dissatisfaction, we're going to make a change. We're going to gladden the mind. We're going to experience the moment as it is. And there are things that we can say then mentally that are completely different than whatever unwholesome thoughts are. We can have wholesome thoughts now. Wow, I'm glad I caught that. Or wow, I don't have to do that work right now. So if we're thinking about doing some work and say, I don't have to do that right now, I can wait. Yeah, I can sit here and just be happy for a few moments. No place to go and nothing to do. Everything is all right. And we bring ourselves back into a state of satisfaction. So part of that, Saddha, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was going to ask you, because sometimes, like, my bad, I cut you off, but sometimes, like, the days where I'm satisfied or things just kind of turn left, like, I kind of have a habit of, like, being addicted to things, how things was. So I don't know how to just kind of get myself out of that, or it's just pretty much— All right.

**Speaker A:** So whenever you see yourself longing for the past, wanting things to not change, the recognition is that everything changes and you have a chance to change too. So when the times change, you change with them. So that you become satisfied with how things changed too. You were satisfied the way that it was. You weren't probably even aware that you were satisfied the way things were, but when they changed, now you're dissatisfied because they changed. Can you wake up and say, hey, I see that I just became satisfied— dissatisfied when I reminisced about something that had changed. And guess what? I can't do anything about it. If my favorite cup fell off the counter and broke on the floor, all I can do is change the way I feel. I can't change whether the cup broke or not. Can't change that. That's in the past. It's already done. So if that's the case, then all I can do is stop dropping and breaking my mind on the floor over the cup that broke on the floor. I don't have to do that. I can be okay with the cup being broken. I've got that choice. Many times we don't have the choice about what happens, but we have the choice about the way that we feel about it. If we can recognize that the only alternative is the old way, is to be dissatisfied. And you can change that so that you can become satisfied, because you can't change what happened, but you can change your mind. That's what it's all about, is that it's not what happens is how we feel about it and whether or not we can change our old style of feeling by talking to ourselves about, "Wow, I'm really glad that I can see that I'm dissatisfied. That cup broke last week and my thought about it is, and I'm still dissatisfied because I miss my cup." Yeah, so that's how we do it. And we do that with broken cups, broken relationships, broken cars, broken bank accounts, broken everything. And just because it broke, we feel bad, rather than recognizing that we've got a choice. We don't have to feel bad because the cup broke or the car broke. And in fact, more than likely, when the relationship broke, it's broke because both people are dissatisfied. And if we're not dissatisfied with the relationship, it probably isn't going to be nearly as broken. So this is the whole teaching of the Buddha right there in a nutshell. Let's play a little game about, oh, what about enlightenment? What about Nirvana? What about Nibbana? What about all of that stuff that's so high up there, Arahants and all of that kind of stuff. Well, if you're completely satisfied, then you don't need those labels. But if somebody's enlightened and has to make sure that you know he's enlightened, then he's not, because he's not satisfied that if you put that label on it about if we can be satisfied, that's all there is to it. But then you begin to feel like a champion. Your satisfaction is so good that you know you can handle anything, and that gives you an attitude of a winner. I can handle anything because I can remain satisfied no matter what goes down. And then we have great power. That's the spiritual power. The spiritual power to be able to handle anything. Can't touch me. You know that song? Yeah, Can't Touch Me. All right, that's the kind of attitude that we bring on. And you don't have to be a martial artist or a pop star to have that attitude. And in fact, if you develop that attitude in your own mind, you'll become a pop star, and other people will see that. You can see that Kishon has something. Yeah, he's got something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** And it's available to you too. That's why he gave you my contact, that you can get that mojo, you can get that attitude that they can't touch me. You know, often people get into a state of wanting revenge. They want to get back, they want to retry, they want a do-over, they want a second round, right? Why is that? Because they're dissatisfied with the past. They want to do it again. They probably lose again and be dissatisfied again. And so around and around and around they go. But if you have the attitude of a winner, if you have a good life anyway, then we don't need to get back. We don't need that revenge. They say that in fact, revenge is best served cold, which means wait until they're not expecting them and then blindside them. But there's another way of thinking about it, and that is the best revenge, the sweetest revenge, is to live well, is to be okay. In other words, they didn't touch you. Whatever it was that they did didn't get to you. They didn't get— they can't touch you. Yeah, that's the way to look at it, is that they can't get to you, they can't touch you. You're satisfied, and you can remain satisfied with whatever happens. And so this is actually the practice, and we call the practice Anapanasati. And this is fairly well understood now, that that's the only teaching, or the only practice that the Buddha gave, the only meditation, if you use that word, that he gave, was this mindfulness of breathing that has this quality of the Eightfold Noble Path that I've been discussing with you, of waking up, seeing that you've got that dissatisfaction, and making a change. And pretty soon you can see the dissatisfaction coming. It's like you can see the arrow in the air and you can dodge it. You can see the insults in the air before you get hit with them. Like the baseball star, instead of getting hit in the head with the baseball, he catches it handsomely. Okay, so that's how we deal with things, the insults and slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Be ready for it. Wakey wakey, catch it in the air or it'll slap you in the face. You're about to say something, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but some days, like, let's say, like, I guess for example, say like I'm doing my schoolwork, like I have like a barrage of thoughts like, oh, I don't feel like doing it, I don't want to do it, or like I'm tired, like a whole bunch of like unwholesome thoughts. Yeah, yeah, it's just like, like I'd be like, all right, I'm gonna do it one step at a time, but it's like, it like out— it's like, it's like a small wall, like the rock, like the small rock, which like I guess kind of like stopping and kind of just reinforcing just doing the work, and then like a whole giant wave of just like dissatisfying thoughts just kind of like knocks down the rock, so to speak. So I'm just kind of figuring out how to like, how to just like stay sturdy or stay grounded.

**Speaker A:** Right, well, that's the whole point, is you got to focus on the wrong thing. Instead of focusing on the rock, focus on the wave, because the wave is not fully a wave, it's just one drop at a time. Just a lot of them. But it's just one thought at a time, right? So the way to handle that, if you're in a task that you don't really want to do and you, and you're telling yourself all of these unwholesome thoughts about it, the right thing to do is to remember to wake up and to see that, oh, I'm in a state of dissatisfaction, let me change that. And here's what we would do. We would say, whatever work that is that I don't want to do right now, and telling myself all this stuff about it, I probably won't be doing a very good job of it anyway. So let me stop doing that job and spend 3 or 4 or 5 minutes getting my mind back together so that I will be happy doing that task. And that would be possible. Let us say that you work for an hour on some homework. Wouldn't it be better instead of working on the homework, starting off in a dissatisfied mood, is to spend the first 5 minutes getting yourself into satisfaction? And then you do a little bit of it. Then you get dissatisfied again. And so you stop and you get yourself back into a state of satisfaction again. And then you do some of it, and more and more, and then you get dissatisfied again. And so you stop, and you get yourself back into a state of satisfaction again, and then you go do the work again. And pretty soon you wind up spending about the same amount of time doing the work dissatisfied, and now you're doing the work being satisfied, sprinkled in with other times of stopping the work and getting satisfied. And you'll wind up probably getting more done, happierly done, better done if you're in a state of happiness when you're doing it. And so this is the way— oh, I don't want to do that right now, I want to sit and relax. I don't know what to do about that. In fact, I was confused. But while I'm sitting here the idea comes from. Aha! Now I know what to do, and so I'll go and I'll do that one. All right, that's the way to do it, is do it through inspiration that pops up because we're satisfied. But it's really hard for it to pop up when we're spinning the mind in dissatisfaction. So the thing to do then is to work on getting the mind back satisfied, saying things like, oh, I don't have to do it right now. Oh, I'm going to be restful in the peace. Oh, I can gladden my mind. I can feel really, really good for a moment. And get yourself back into the feeling of satisfaction, that you're just satisfied. You're not doing the work and you're still satisfied because you know that you can do it better when you're in a state of satisfaction. So that's exactly how you would plan that, is you would— whenever you're doing something and you don't like doing it, stop two things: stop doing the work and stop hating doing the work. Get yourself away from it, take a break, go to the bathroom, get yourself some coffee. Or better still, get your mind together, get your mojo back, tell yourself, 'Oh, I can do that. I just don't want to do it right now, but I can do it beautifully later.' That's the way we practice, okay? And so I would recommend then that you start to practice on a formal kind of a schedule. And I would recommend 6 times a day for 5 minutes. We're only talking about a half hour a day. And wouldn't it be really nice to spend a half hour a day throughout the day, 5 minutes at a time, feeling really good?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was writing that down.

**Speaker A:** I know, because you thought it was such a good idea you don't want to forget it. But you won't forget it even if you don't write it down. You'll remember. Okay, so here's the times that we're going to do this. The most important time is when you wake up and when you go to bed, because when we wake up in the morning, almost never do we wake up and immediately get out of bed. We'll put the snooze alarm on. So the mind is like that too. We can wake up a little bit, or we can wake up a lot. So the first thing that I would say in the morning, before you get out of bed, spend 5 minutes thinking about 'Wow, I'm going to get a lot done today.' 'Wow, today is going to be a really great day.' 'Wow, ain't nothing going to bother me today. I can handle anything today.' Start having those kind of positive, wholesome thoughts, and then when you get up out of bed you'll be getting out of bed really well. So the difference between getting off— they saw it— the right side of the bed and the wrong side of the bed— oh, I got up off the wrong side of the bed today because he's so dissatisfied. Well, you can get yourself ready to have a satisfied day right in the early morning. As soon as you wake up, you can say, wow, what a good day this is. 'Wow, I can handle this.' 'Wow, I can lay in bed here for the next 5 minutes and feel just really good.' And then at night, when people go to sleep, it's quite common. In fact, there's a lot of rules about it, about how much sleep you're supposed to get, and you're supposed to go to bed and go to sleep at a particular time instead of going according to your own biological clock, you're going according to the alarm clock. The alarm clock is running your, your life. And people will say, oh, I've got so much to do tomorrow, I got to get to sleep. But then they start thinking about all the stuff they got to do tomorrow. A better kind of thought was, oh, this is so nice, no place to go and nothing to do for the next 8 hours. No place to go and nothing to do for the next all night long. Doesn't even matter whether I sleep or not. What matters is that I lay here and feel good. No worries, no flurries, no place to go. I'm not going to be doing any emails tonight, so why should I think about emails? I'm not going to do any programming tonight, and why should I be thinking about programming tonight? I'm not going to be digging any ditches or working on any cars tonight. I'm in bed, so why am I thinking about it? And we can just stop thinking about all that kind of stuff and think about how nice it is that I don't have to do anything at all. And then we can drift into sleep very very happily, which means that then we're less likely to have nightmares or dreams or anything. It's because the mind is clean. Most people, they worry themselves into sleep, and then they worry all night while they're sleeping. And the better thing to do is to get yourself into a really good state before you go to sleep at night, and then you can sleep well. So these are the two times it's really valuable to practice Anapanasati, to remember to take good easy breaths. No place to go and nothing to do. And so that only leaves four times during the day, like break time, on the way to work, Traveling, where in Atlanta you probably use some public transportation, so that's a good time to practice. At lunchtime, that's a good time to practice. When we're eating, "Oh, this is delicious, let me pay attention to what I'm eating," rather than paying attention to what work I've got to do after I finish eating. 'Let me enjoy what I'm doing right now.' So this is the way that we practice, and pretty soon we remember to practice correctly even more and more often. But we do have to do it a little bit formally. We have to actually put the effort into it, to take the time to actually practice doing this, and then pretty soon it begins to be easier. Easy, but we have to practice persistence over and over again. In fact, one of the little jokes that we tell is that the entire teachings of the Buddha is on every shampoo bottle at 7-Eleven and the grocery stores. They all have the entire teachings of the Buddha right there on the shampoo bottle. The entire teachings of the Buddha can be summed up in the phrase rinse and repeat.

**Speaker B:** That's like Karate Kid.

**Speaker A:** Rinse and repeat. Rinse your mind out, clean your mind out of those unwholesome thoughts, and then do it again. And then do it again, because those unwholesome thoughts will keep coming back. You're in the habit of it. One of the ways of saying it— you've been talking to yourself for your whole life, of talking yourself into feeling bad. Now we're going to start talking ourselves into feeling good, and we're going to remember to do that, because if we forget then we're just going to keep talking to ourselves into feeling bad. So we have to practice, we have to remember to practice. And what is the practice? It's to wake up and see that that's Dukkha, that I'm dissatisfied with that. Haha, I see that dissatisfaction. Let me drop that and become satisfied again. Okay, to rinse and repeat. Remember to clean that mind out and then do it again, then do it again, and then do it again. Got to be done over and over and over again. But you can, you know you can. If you can do it one time, you can do it a second time. If you can do it a second time, you can do it a third time. In fact, I've seen you go in and out of satisfaction, dissatisfaction. Several times. I saw you run up and turn the alarm clock. I saw you take and write stuff down. The only reason you wrote stuff down is because you were afraid that you'd forget, and you were dissatisfied right there in that moment. So that's the thing to do, is to start looking for these little dissatisfactions so that we can see them and say, aha, I caught that one. Because the normal thing that people are going to do is, "Oh, I caught it. Oh, poor me. Oh, what am I going to do? I can never remember." And that's all a bunch of unwholesome thoughts. And a wholesome thought would be, "Aha, I caught you. I can do this. I can take on a positive attitude. I can look on the bright side of life. Life is wonderful." Why do people go around being miserable when they could be thinking about how nice and wonderful things are? A lot of guys do time in prison because they were dissatisfied, and so they went because they were dissatisfied and did something that made them even more, and a whole lot of other people, dissatisfied. Yeah, but if we can be in a state of satisfaction, then we're free. We don't have to deal with anybody or anything. Because we're not doing anything to get rid of our dissatisfaction, because we can see it and deal with it directly. That's why this is called the Direct Path. We work with our satisfaction, not with things that will get us satisfaction, like robbing a liquor store or robbing a bank. They think is going to make them satisfied. No, they need to become satisfied before they rob the liquor store. Or if they're satisfied before they yell at your girlfriend, because the only reason you'd ever yell at a girlfriend is because you're dissatisfied. So start looking at the dissatisfactions in life, and when you see them, you say, aha, I saw that. Now I have a choice, and that's the whole teaching.

**Speaker B:** Discussion with you. I guess when those thoughts would come.

**Speaker A:** In.

**Speaker B:** Like, I would do something, I guess, out of obligation, or.

**Speaker A:** Because the obligation says is that if you don't do it, you're going to be dissatisfied. The question is, can you do what's obligated, what's really obligatory, can you do that happily? Well, yeah, so you don't do things out of dissatisfaction and obligation; you do things because you like doing them. Because you got to do it anyway, so why not like doing it? Let me draw it this way so that you can see it. It's like a four-paned window like this, all right? One side, the other side, and then up and down. So think of it from side to side is on this side you don't like it. No, wait a minute, let's do it this way. You don't do it, and on this side you do do it. You either don't do it or you do do it. And now on the horizontal, you either like it or you don't like it. Now the question is, are you going to do it and like it, or don't do it and like it, or are you going to don't like it and do it, or don't like it and not do it. So you always have 4 choices: are you going to do it or not? And the obligations— well, we are going to do that. We make that choice. That's why we call them obligations. The question is, can you choose to do the obligations happily, or do you have to do them miserably? Because you do have a choice. You don't really have to do it. But often if you don't do it, then you'll feel bad. The question is, is even if you don't do it, can you feel good? Yeah, I'm not going to do that. Stuff that. Haha. So you always have a choice of whether you're going to do it or not, and you always have a choice about how you feel about it. And you should practice then The best thing is to practice liking it when you're not doing anything at all. To sit down and do nothing at all and really like, "Ah, got no place to go, nothing to do, I'm not doing anything, oh wow, this is so nice." Because if we can get ourselves into liking state when we're not doing something, then we can transfer that from liking not doing into liking and doing. And now we have a choice, are we going to do it or not? But we're not going to make a choice about whether we like it or not. We're going to always choose, I like it, I like it. Okay, so get yourself into a state of satisfaction, and then we can do stuff in a satisfactory, satisfying way. Another way of thinking about it is this: this is the process of making friends with ourselves, that you're okay, warts and all. All the crap that's ever happened didn't kill you. Here you are now, you're still alive. So the past don't really matter anymore. Here we are. So we can make friends with ourselves. We don't have to be critical. 'Oh, you should do this, oh, you should do that.' We can say, 'Well, no, what I should do is be happy, and then I can choose what I'm going to do.' Make friends with yourself on the inside. Be comfortable and satisfied with yourself on the inside, and then you can be comfortable and happy and satisfied with people out there and make friends with them too. But being around a whole lot of dissatisfied people that are trying to make you dissatisfied because they're dissatisfied is not wise. An example of that is, is that when people go into AA to quit drinking, the AA folks recommend don't go back to the bars because the people who are in the bars see you as a drinker and they want you to stay a drinker. They're going to try to get you to drink too. So don't go back to your old friends. Get some new friends. Get some Kishon kind of friends. Come join us on the Sangha and have some good friends that's going to help you to remember to have a good life, rather than being around people who are unhappy. But if you're really strong and really good at it, then it's okay to be around those unhappy people because you're going to go and spread your joy. And joy is much more powerful than anger. You just have to keep at it. Okay, so we can talk later about that kind of stuff, but right now the very introduction is, is that your job is to get your mind into a good happy state, and you can do that just by remembering to do it. Aha, I can throw that stuff out. Aha, I see you, Mr. Unhappiness. Then you can quit doing whatever you're doing and get yourself happy, and then go back and do it happily. It's that— it's easy.

**Speaker B:** All right, I will do that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, call me in a few days. Go practice this for a while and then call me and we'll talk some more. All right, all right.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, I'm really glad to meet you, Jet. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Appreciate it. Thanks for taking time out of your day to help me.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I was saying thanks for taking time out of your day to help me. Yeah, I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Great. Yeah, I got so much joy, I gotta share it for sure. Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a participant named Jet (Speaker B), is a practical and direct introduction to the core of Buddhist practice framed as the pursuit of **satisfaction**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: The Direct Path to Satisfaction**
The entire teaching is presented not as abstract philosophy or complex meditation, but as a direct method to end dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) and cultivate satisfaction. Enlightenment is equated with being "really satisfied with one's life."

### **Main Teachings:**

1.  **Redefining *Dukkha*:** *Dukkha* is best understood as "dissatisfaction" rather than "suffering." This makes it a lighter, more manageable experience we can work with in the present moment—like an unhappy thought or a minor irritation.

2.  **The Four Noble Truths (Simplified):**
    *   **1st Truth:** There is dissatisfaction.
    *   **2nd Truth:** We ignorantly create our own dissatisfaction through our thoughts and attitudes.
    *   **3rd Truth:** It is possible to become satisfied.
    *   **4th Truth:** The path to satisfaction is the **Eightfold Noble Path**.

3.  **The Practical Method: "Rinse and Repeat"**
    The core practice is a continuous, moment-to-cycle:
    *   **Wake Up (Sati/Mindfulness):** Remember to notice your present state.
    *   **Recognize Dissatisfaction:** Catch the unwholesome, dissatisfying thought or mood.
    *   **Make a Change (Gladden the Mind):** Consciously drop the negative thought and replace it with a satisfying, wholesome one (e.g., "I can handle this," "No place to go, nothing to do," "Aha! I caught that one!").
    *   **Repeat:** Do this over and over, like the instructions on a shampoo bottle. The mind's natural habit is to jump (the "monkey mind"); the practice is to guide its jump toward satisfaction.

4.  **Key Attitude Shift: From Victim to Winner**
    *   A **victim** feels deprived and needs to win or get something to be satisfied.
    *   A **winner** already has the internal attitude of satisfaction and doesn't need to prove anything. This creates true spiritual power—the feeling that external events "can't touch" your inner peace.

5.  **Application in Daily Life:**
    *   **Formal Practice:** Schedule 5 minutes of practice, 6 times a day (upon waking, before bed, and during breaks). Use this time to cultivate wholesome, satisfying thoughts.
    *   **During Tasks:** When faced with an unpleasant obligation (like homework), stop both the task *and* the negative self-talk. First, spend a few minutes regaining a satisfied mind, *then* return to the task. You'll work better and happier.
    *   **With Change & Loss:** When something changes (a broken cup, a broken relationship), recognize that while you can't change the past event, you *can* choose not to "break your mind" over it. Satisfaction is a choice about your internal response.

### **Memorable Analogies & Phrases:**
*   **"Chick Magnet" Car:** An example of seeking satisfaction indirectly through external objects.
*   **"Can't Touch Me":** The attitude of one who maintains internal satisfaction.
*   **"Rinse and Repeat":** The entire Dhamma summed up as cleansing the mind of unwholesome thoughts and repeating the process.
*   **"Catching the Baseball":** Seeing dissatisfaction coming and skillfully catching it before it hits you.
*   **The Four-Choice Window:** For any obligation, you can choose to **do it or not do it**, and **like it or not like it**. The aim is to always choose to **like it**, regardless of the action.

### **Conclusion:**
Dhammarato emphasizes that this is a practice of **making friends with yourself**, learning to be okay "warts and all." By constantly recognizing and releasing little dissatisfactions, you build a foundation of inner well-being that makes you resilient and a source of joy for others. The talk ends with an encouragement to practice this simple "rinse and repeat" method and report back.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and the path to satisfaction. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Chick Magnet:** A man who can't get a girl buys a car, calling it a "chick magnet." This illustrates the indirect and often futile ways we seek satisfaction through external objects.
2.  **The Indirect Path:** "If we want to go from A to C, we go to B and D and F and G..." This metaphor describes the confused, roundabout way people seek satisfaction instead of addressing the root cause (dissatisfaction) directly.
3.  **Monkey Mind:** A classic Buddhist metaphor for the restless, jumping nature of the untrained mind. The speaker uses it to prove the mind can change quickly, and the task is to guide its "jumps" toward satisfaction.
4.  **The Arrow (or Baseball):** You can learn to see dissatisfaction (an insult, a negative thought) like "an arrow in the air" or a baseball, and learn to "dodge it" or "catch it handsomely" before it hits you and causes suffering.
5.  **The Wave and the Rock:** In response to Jet's struggle with a "barrage" of unmotivated thoughts, the speaker reframes it. The negative thoughts aren't a single giant wave knocking down a rock (willpower). Instead, see them as individual drops (single thoughts) that can be dealt with one at a time.
6.  **Rinse and Repeat:** The entire teaching is compared to the instructions on a shampoo bottle. You "rinse" the mind of unwholesome thoughts and then "repeat" the process as needed, emphasizing continuous, diligent practice.
7.  **The Four-Paned Window (Choice Matrix):** A visual metaphor for our choices in any situation:
    *   **Vertical Axis:** Do it / Don't do it.
    *   **Horizontal Axis:** Like it / Don't like it.
    The key insight is we often choose *what* to do (e.g., an obligation) but forget we always have the choice to *like it or not*. The goal is to choose the "Do it and like it" quadrant.
8.  **Making Friends with Yourself:** The practice is described as a process of internal reconciliation—being "okay, warts and all"—just as you would make friends with another person.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **Bruce Lee Forgetting How to Fight:** The speaker asks Jet to imagine if Bruce Lee, in a movie, suddenly forgot how to fight. This story highlights the crucial role of **remembering** (*sati*, mindfulness). If you remember to be mindful, you can change; if you forget, you're stuck in old patterns.
2.  **The Alarm Clock Incident:** This is a real-time, lived story within the conversation. When Jet's alarm goes off, he gets up, interrupting the talk. The speaker immediately uses this as a perfect example of a small dissatisfaction (the interruption) triggering an automatic, dissatisfied reaction, illustrating the very cycle they are discussing.
3.  **Goenka's "Never Mind, Start Again":** The story of meditation teacher S.N. Goenka's common instruction is used to contrast the right and wrong response to noticing the mind has wandered. The wrong way is to fuss and get more dissatisfied; the right way is to simply and happily "start again."
4.  **The Broken Cup:** A simple story to illustrate non-attachment and choice. Once a cup is broken, you cannot change that fact (the past). The only thing you can change is your mind—you can choose to stop "breaking your mind on the floor over the cup."
5.  **The Person in AA:** This anecdote advises caution about social environment. Just as someone quitting drinking is advised to avoid old drinking buddies who might pull them back, someone seeking satisfaction should be mindful of spending too much time with chronically dissatisfied people who reinforce negative habits.
6.  **The Pop Star / "Can't Touch Me" Attitude:** Referencing MC Hammer's song, the speaker describes the "spiritual power" of deep satisfaction as an attitude where external events "can't touch" your inner peace. He suggests this is the recognizable "mojo" that spiritually developed people like their mutual friend Kishon have.

These metaphors and stories serve to ground abstract Buddhist principles (Dukkha, the Eightfold Path, mindfulness) in tangible, everyday experiences, making the teaching practical and immediately applicable.
