### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, let's just start with something that is real then. And the reality is that everything changes.

**Speaker B:** But they don't, they just repeat.

**Speaker A:** Well, when you're looking at a very, very small part of the cycle, That sounds true.

**Speaker B:** But the cycles just repeat. The thoughts are the same over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** All right. And you don't want to do anything about it. You'd rather just be defeated by them.

**Speaker B:** Well, no, but they're just the same over and over and over again, no matter what I do.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you're looking at it with a particular kind of attitude. The first thing that we have to get around is the fact that nothing is the same. Things are constantly changing. Even the thoughts that you have, whether you like them or not, they're in a cycle. Sometimes you have that thought, sometimes you don't, right? You don't have the same thought over and over again. It's different thoughts.

**Speaker B:** But it's— but they repeat again and again, even the same exact thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but you're using the word plural, thoughts. It's not the same thought.

**Speaker B:** It is, but there's like several— there's like 100 of them that are the same over and over again. And they cycle, they all do.

**Speaker A:** You can only have, you can only have one of them at a time. Yes, one thought at a time. Okay, and so you're going through a cycle of 100 different thoughts, not recognizing the uniqueness of each individual thought.

**Speaker B:** They're not unique.

**Speaker A:** Yes, they are.

**Speaker B:** Very well, they're not unique.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say they're rehearsed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're not unique. They're definitely not.

**Speaker A:** They're repeating. Okay. And yet, let us say a major piece of music work, like a sonata or a concerto, every time the artist plays it, even though he's played it dozens and dozens of times in public, every time he plays it, it's different, slightly different.

**Speaker B:** Mine are not different, they're not, they're the same 100 thoughts that all take turns and repeat.

**Speaker A:** Right. Let's go back to the symphony. Even though the audience will think that the symphony is exactly the same as it was the last time it played, as if it were a recording. But even when you have vinyl records— you probably had vinyl records when you were a child— every time that vinyl record is played, it deteriorates. And a great deal of money and expense was going into the price of turntables and how to not have the record deteriorate because every time they're displayed, it gets little scratches on it, and eventually it's not worth playing. So every time the record is played, it's different.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, my thoughts are not different. They're like the same thoughts that keep coming and going.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. But I only get a few seconds.

**Speaker B:** Of reprieve from them. It's— that's not long enough.

**Speaker A:** Well, you could have another reprieve.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's not— it's not long enough, and there's not enough.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay. Um, well, we're going to get stuck then.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm— yeah, I am stuck.

**Speaker A:** No, you and I are going to get stuck.

**Speaker B:** Oh.

**Speaker A:** We're going to get stuck because I keep saying something that I know for a fact that's true. I know for a fact that it's true because I see it on a regular basis. I see it both from the scientific and the physical as well as experiential, and I know that things are constantly changing. And you're trying to tell me no, they don't. All right, so actually, if you If you want to know philosophically, this is the main reason why 90% of the people who actually know something about the Dhamma don't get any value out of it, is because of this. Now there's actually many things in our society, and our language, and our culture, that teaches us that things don't change. An example of that is original sin in Christianity. In fact, all of Christianity and most religions is built upon that you need the grace of God, or you need forgiveness, or that you need something from the outside world, because you're inherently broken. And you're going to stay broken. And so this is what they call original sin, and that you need some outside help to get over it. And what happens then is exploitation, is because the people who think that they need help and are crying for help will do many things in the name of getting that help, and the charlatans wind up taking them for a ride. Okay, and so people get the attitude that they, that they can't change. If you can't change, then that means that things are permanent, and this goes in the direction of everlasting. But the teachings of the Buddha are basically founded upon the fact that you can change, because everything is already changing all the time.. And all we have to do is see that things are changing all the time. That in fact, in this conversation, things have been changing. The wind is blowing, the television got turned on, when Puja moved from the steps up to the porch, Panda Dog has now gotten up and is walking across the room. And I can see all of these things happening because of peripheral vision. And so I know that things are changing constantly. So when you kind— when you come up and tell me that you can't change, I know that you're just not looking at things closely enough to see that they are changing.

**Speaker B:** Because I've already tried, I've already tried, and they just keep coming back, repeating themselves.

**Speaker A:** All right, um, you're like the cook in the kitchen that doesn't want to cook anymore because every time she cooks there's trash, there's garbage, there's onion peels, there's packaging, there's all kinds of things that get put into the trash. And all the real cook has to do is just take out the trash. But then she gets tired of taking out the trash, and so she doesn't want to take out the trash anymore. And now the kitchen is full of trash, and so she doesn't want to cook anymore because the kitchen is full of trash. And all she has to do is just take out some trash and clean it up. Yeah, but the trash is going to build up again. It's just going to build up again.

**Speaker B:** And take it out again. It generated 5 trillion tons of trash, then yeah, she would be reasonable in not wanting to cook. There'd be 5 trillion tons generated every time she cooked.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's a bit grandiose. I don't know of any cook that has 5 trillion tons of trash. In fact, I don't even think— maybe.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't work like other people's. It's a lot worse.

**Speaker A:** Oh, now you're claiming special?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a lot worse than, than most people's. Mine races a lot.

**Speaker A:** Mine races. I would say offhand you're quite.

**Speaker B:** Average. I mean, I don't know how you know that because I'm the one inside my head and it's racing.

**Speaker A:** I, I would say that that's average because I have seen a lot of people behave that way; that in fact, election time is a good time to see how stupid people are, because of the way they vote. And they won't change, even though they have known, most of the Republicans have known that Donald Trump was a criminal, and a crook, and a liar, and they knew that, especially the New Yorkers They knew it all back in the 1990s, but his fans began to see it, and now it's more than obvious that he's a crook, that he's a criminal. And yet he still has people following him. That shows how many stupid people there are. By the millions there are stupid people. So you can't complain to me that you're new, unique. You're not unique. You're quite ordinary and average. But the teachings of the Buddha are for not those average, ordinary people. For those people, we have religions and doctors and psychologists and pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals and all kinds of outside helps. But the teaching of the Buddha has to do with someone taking the attitude that they can change, and then making that change, and then making that change, and then making that change, and then making that change. Or in the case of the cook, she wants to cook, and so she knows that she's creating trash, garbage, so she takes it out. She throws it out, then she cooks some more, and then she takes out the trash again.

**Speaker B:** But I don't know how to have the attitude of allowing my thoughts, because we talked about that last time.

**Speaker A:** And well, look at the fact that you don't like them. Let's go with that. I know you don't like.

**Speaker B:** Them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't know how to like.

**Speaker B:** Them all of a sudden.

**Speaker A:** I didn't ask you to like them. I'm asking you to see that you don't like them.

**Speaker B:** I do see that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so recognize that you are in a state then of not liking. Yeah, yeah, you go around not liking stuff a lot. You complain about it a lot. You don't like that trash that accumulates in the cook's kitchen, okay? And since you don't like it, you don't really want to do anything about it, because doing something about it means that you got to deal with it, and you don't like it and you don't want to deal with it.

**Speaker B:** No, I try to— no, I try to remove them. It doesn't work.

**Speaker A:** Well, it did when you did remove them.

**Speaker B:** But only for a few seconds. That's not enough time.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's all I'm asking. I'm only asking for a few seconds.

**Speaker B:** But I'm asking for more.

**Speaker A:** I know, because you don't like them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know they're really pointless or even detrimental.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're the one who was judging them as judgmental, and you're the one who is judging them as pointless, right?

**Speaker B:** But I don't know how not to. I mean, that's the part I don't know how not to do.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us do that right now then. Let us, let us talk about, um, unicorns. Have you ever seen a picture of a unicorn? They actually don't exist. They're looking like, uh, beautiful little ponies with with a horn, right? So you can think about unicorns, you can put something new in your mind. So now you can say, hello little unicorn, and take a deep sigh, just take a deep breath and say, hello unicorn.

**Speaker B:** Hello unicorn.

**Speaker A:** All right, now guess what? You didn't have judgmental thoughts of, I don't like the unicorn right then, did you? Just for a few seconds, you were okay. Yeah. All right, that's all the practice is, is what we're doing right now. And you're making it a long-term kind of thing that you want a kitchen that never, uh, develops any trash, or just kitchens are not like that.

**Speaker B:** Just not the same 100 thoughts on a cyclical repeat.

**Speaker A:** Well, every time that you peel a tomato, you've got a tomato skin. Every time that you chop up an onion, you've got onion skins. Okay, every time that you open a package, you've got the packaging. There is going to be life itself, and it's through the use of a kitchen By definition, a kitchen is going to create garbage. The use of the kitchen creates garbage. The question is, are you tough and big and strong enough to just toss that garbage right out and start again? Never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** No, because I do— yes, because I do that, but it just comes right back.

**Speaker A:** So no. Well, the garbage will come back as you use the kitchen. It comes back again. No kitchen is going to be empty of garbage for long.

**Speaker B:** But it comes back like 5 seconds later.

**Speaker A:** Great, that gave you 5.

**Speaker B:** Seconds. But then I get frustrated and it's too much. It's repeating too.

**Speaker A:** Much.

**Speaker B:** Choose to get frustrated. I don't see how that's a choice.

**Speaker A:** Well, I know that you don't see it how it's a choice is because you're, um, you're in such a habit of doing it and it happens so fast that you don't recognize that this is just a habit. It's just a habit, and you allow that habit to continue on. Okay, it's, it's almost— let's look at it like a security system in the front yard that you've installed, a security system. And every time that an intruder or even a bird comes into the yard, those, um, the lights come on. And now you're sitting in the house hating the fact that the lights come on, when in fact that's a security system that you installed. You intentionally wanted that security system to be there And now it keeps coming on, which gives you then an opportunity to look out the window to make sure that things are safe. If you're in the dark, then you don't know. Okay, so if you look at it from like that, then these lights that come on are this garbage that's created in the kitchen. You installed that stuff. As a child, and now that security system is going off over and over and over again, and you don't like it. But it's your choice as to whether to turn the security system off or not. And you don't want to turn it off, you want to leave it on. You do not want, in fact, for your life to become absolutely free from fear, because you'll be dead very quickly, because you'll go do something that an ordinary person which he was dangerous. But that's in fact one of the definitions of insanity, is going and doing the same thing over and over and over again expecting a new change. And people do that, they keep doing the same things over and over again expecting something new to happen instead of giving yourself congratulations for 5 seconds.

**Speaker B:** Off. I mean, I do congratulate myself for that, but like you said, I'm lying to.

**Speaker A:** Myself. Well, the lying to yourself is not seeing the reality that you did have 5 seconds off, that in fact you're discounting that. That's the lie. The lie is that you can't change, when the reality is that you've been changing all along. The lights come on, the lights go off, the trash builds up, you have to take it out, you don't like to take it out.

**Speaker B:** I would like to take it out if it stayed out, but this is trash that jumps back in.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't stay out. The use of the kitchen creates more garbage.

**Speaker B:** Well, then I'd rather not use the kitchen.

**Speaker A:** That— well, how are we going to commit suicide then?

**Speaker B:** Well, I know I'd rather not use my mind. How do I not do.

**Speaker A:** That? Well, every time that you do something with the mind, then you can just forget about it and say never mind and throw it out. That's exactly what we do practice. Just never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I do that a bunch of times a day too, and it's— no, that just makes me frustrated. Never mind, start again. I just did that 5 seconds ago.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and then you get stuck into not liking the fact that you have to put in the right effort. You're the one who has to take the trash out. You're the one who has to take the right effort, and you don't like taking the right effort.

**Speaker B:** No, because it's— it doesn't work.

**Speaker A:** It only works for a few seconds. Yes, that's all we're asking for.

**Speaker B:** That's not all I'm asking for.

**Speaker A:** I know, that's why you keep getting yourself disappointed. It's because it's never enough. It's never enough. It's not good enough. And you're in that judgmental mind state that it's never good enough. In fact, that's what the things that you're seeing is, the judgment.

**Speaker B:** But then how do I get out of.

**Speaker A:** That? Seeing it and saying, okay, right now I'm not going to have judgmental thoughts. Right now I'm going to look at the body. I'm going to watch the body. I'm going to watch what's happening in the real world and come out of this artificial mind state that humans have created, that we live in our own mental world when in fact we've got a great big wide wonderful world that we could be paying attention to instead. Starting with the body, going with the sensations over and over again. Why? Because you have been talking yourself into feeling bad all of these years, and so now you're pretty well stuck into feeling bad. Okay, so that means that you're now going to start practicing over and over and over and giving yourself wholesome happy thoughts over and over and over again. Come back into the present moment and to take a rest from the thoughts. And they'll come right back again, sure, but now at least you've had 5 seconds. So you can also see, "Hey, I did have 5 seconds, and I can have 5 more seconds." Taking another deep breath and coming into the present moment and start building some new habits. Start recognizing that you have many, many, many tiny little choices. Every time you pick something up, that's a choice. Every time you move your hands, that's a choice. But most Most of our choices is done on automatic pilot, done by habit. And you're beginning to see your habits and you don't like them a bit. Why? Because not liking is one of your favorite habits. And so you don't want to change. Because it takes some effort to change, or actually you're convincing yourself that you can't change, which is where most of the world is. That's why businesses sell so many products, is because people have the mentality that, "Oh, I'm not good enough without that product, and I got to go buy it." So that's one of the things you could try, and I don't recommend it, but you could go become a shopaholic. That way at least you're thinking about the goods that are in the store, thinking about wanting them, rather than thinking about how bad your thoughts are and how you feel about the thoughts. So finding something to distract you from the inside Anagami, Anapanasati, come into the moment, into the reality of the.

**Speaker B:** Situation. I'm not even in the reality of the situation now because I'm still having.

**Speaker A:** Thoughts while you're While I was talking, you were listening, and as soon as I was quiet, that's when you started complaining again.

**Speaker B:** No, but I was having thoughts while you were talking.

**Speaker A:** Right, but you were also listening, so there was a.

**Speaker B:** Mixture. Yeah, but there shouldn't be a mixture. It should just be being present.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know that's a rule that you made, that there shouldn't— it shouldn't be the way that you don't want it to be. Instead of being able to enjoy the way things are. You're wanting it to be different, and you can't make it different.

**Speaker B:** So I can't enjoy the way things are because I can't even be present. I'm still thinking even when stuff's happening.

**Speaker A:** Well, then see that and remember that you can take the effort to pay attention to what's going on and not listening to the.

**Speaker B:** Thoughts. No, I don't know how to do.

**Speaker A:** That. Well, you are doing it already. You're listening to me right now. I just said the word right now. Did you hear the word right now? Yeah. You hear the word right now? You can hear that word right now. So you were not 100% of the time stuck in the internal, but a few mind moments get into the senses.

**Speaker B:** But not very much.

**Speaker A:** A higher— there you go again. You're always looking for the worst aspect. You're trying to convince me that you're broken, and you can't convince me that you're broken. Okay, okay. But there's a difference between the hardware and the software, okay? And you're confused about the difference between the hardware and the software. The software can be changed.

**Speaker B:** Well, it just really doesn't seem like it.

**Speaker A:** Well, you did seem like it for 5 seconds. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so congratulate yourself for 5 seconds.

**Speaker B:** I do, but that's so lame and empty.

**Speaker A:** No, I do. I can't. All right, congratulations. Yes, I can. You don't want to do it.

**Speaker B:** You— I don't get what that's supposed to do. What is What is fake congratulating myself supposed to achieve? Because it's annoying.

**Speaker A:** Why don't you do a real congratulations? Why does it have to be a fake?

**Speaker B:** A real— it's not real. I'm not really happy about it. I'm not actually happy. So I don't like having to lie to myself. It's weird.

**Speaker A:** Well, why don't you begin to find some happiness and some congratulations in the little successes. Why do you have to have a great big success? You can have a little success and feel a little successful.

**Speaker B:** But it's too little, so no, I.

**Speaker A:** Can'T. It's too little, right? All right, well, guess what? It's big enough to conceive it is big enough to allow it to be there for a little while, and then you can go do it again for a little while. That you're wanting great big changes and you're not seeing great big changes, and so you're saying, 'I can't change,' when in fact you're constantly in change, you're constantly moving just a little bit. And you're not willing to see the little changes because you want great big.

**Speaker B:** Ones. Well, yeah, because the little ones are too.

**Speaker A:** Little. They don't make it different. And so you— and so you would rather not have one at all because they're too little. You now are saying that, oh, poor me, I can't have any at all because because everyone that I do have is too little.

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, it doesn't matter, because the little ones are too little, so it doesn't.

**Speaker A:** Matter. Well, where are we going to go with this? I mean, the Dhamma is small, the Dharma is simple, there's not much to it. Even the Buddha said he only teaches one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And instead of going from seeing the Dukkha and then coming out of it, You want to complain about the Dukkha, which is just more Dukkha. That's the typical way of doing it. Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, more Dukkha. I see the Dukkha, I hate the Dukkha. And that's not the teaching from the Buddha. The Buddha is to see the Dukkha and stop it, to come out of it, to don't put your foot there. Move your footstep and put it someplace where you're not going to step in a pile of crap.

**Speaker B:** I do, but it just slides back into the.

**Speaker A:** Crap. I do, but— okay, so let's change that sentence with, I do and I can do it.

**Speaker B:** Again. Okay, but then it's just only another 5 seconds.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and you can do it again and get another 5 seconds. So now we got 15 seconds. Then you can do it again, and now you got 20 seconds. Now, is that 20 seconds going to be spread over 6 months, or is it going to be spread over 5.

**Speaker B:** Minutes?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. You're wanting things to be different, rather than accepting that you can at least get some reprieve for 5 seconds. Taking one breath at a time, and let this breath be good enough. Just one breath. Can you have one breath and have it good.

**Speaker B:** Enough?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, so can you take another breath and have it be good.

**Speaker B:** Enough?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, can you take another breath and have it be good enough? Okay. Can you remind yourself to take another breath and let that feel good.

**Speaker B:** Enough?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, can you remind yourself again to take a deep breath and let that be good.

**Speaker B:** Enough?

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, so now we're beginning to practice correctly, which is a big change from the past 30 minutes we've been talking to where everything that I asked you to try, you keep saying, 'Oh, and I can't.' 'Oh, it's not good enough.' Okay, but now you've just proven to yourself that you can take a breath and let it be good.

**Speaker B:** Enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like sometimes— Let's do it again. Let's do it again. Take a deep breath. And let it be good enough. It's keeping you alive. You're still alive. You're taking some breathing. Then remind yourself again to take a deep breath and just let it be. Arya, it's good enough. Then remind yourself again to take another deep breath and let that one too be good enough. And now remind yourself again to take a deep breath and let that be good enough. to take another deep breath and let it be good enough. Go ahead, take another deep breath. Allow yourself to take a deep breath good enough. And now remind yourself again to take a deep breath and let it be good enough. And now take a deep breath and congratulate yourself, for you can take a deep breath and feel good enough. You can actually smile. Go ahead and smile. Allow yourself to smile with the joy of knowing that you can take a good deep breath and feel good enough. Good enough, satisfying enough, just enough. Not special, not super duper, just adequate, satisfying. So remind yourself again to take a deep breath. And recognize that you can do this, so you do it again. I can do this. And so you remember to take another deep breath. Go ahead, take another deep breath. Invitation to be good enough. And now let the eyes gently close, and then just take another deep breath and let that one too be good enough. And feel it on the inside, how good it feels. And remember to take another deep breath, this one too.

**Speaker B:** But there's other thoughts, it's not just about the breath.

**Speaker A:** Why did you interrupt it? Never mind, just remember to take another deep breath. Because it's not— you go back and don't go into that guard there.

**Speaker B:** It's thinking other thoughts.

**Speaker A:** There's other thoughts. I hear you're complaining it's not good enough, so remember to take another deep breath. Go ahead and take another deep breath. Close your eyes and just take another deep breath and let this one be good.

**Speaker B:** Enough. It's not good.

**Speaker A:** Enough. Well, that's because you're deciding that it's not good enough.

**Speaker B:** Because there's other thoughts, that's why.

**Speaker A:** Well, don't pay any attention to them. Just remember to come back and take another deep breath. Because when you are thinking about a deep breath, those thoughts are not there. It's only they come back when you're not thinking about taking a deep breath. And being satisfied with it. So let's continue to do that over and over again, knowing that the thoughts are going to try to come back in as they normally do, but you're going to sit here and take another deep breath anyway and be satisfied with this deep breath. Let the eyes gently close and take another deep breath. Now remember to take another tongue press. And now, as you breathe in, notice the chest area, how it fills up with air as you're breathing in. And as you breathe out, notice that the chest collapses just a little bit. Begin to pay attention to the breathing. And let it be okay. Just satisfying, good enough, deep breath. Remember to take another deep breath. Just take it in and notice the chest area and notice As you're breathing in, the rising and falling. Now, as you're breathing in, notice the body touching the cloth of your clothing. Notice the posture of the body. Notice where the legs are. Notice where the hands are. Notice that you have your head tilted high in the air. You can even relax the neck. Just relax.

**Speaker B:** But I'm thinking all these other thoughts instead of being focused on the breath.

**Speaker A:** We've already established that. We established that the first day, and you've re-established it every time that you've called, and you've re-established it more than a dozen times here today. We know that. Never mind Remember to take another deep breath right now. Just take another deep breath. Be here with the body. And remember to take another deep breath. And now you can begin to have the thought that while I'm breathing like this, everything is okay. This breath is satisfying and everything is okay. No problems, no worries while I'm taking a deep breath. I think everything is okay right now. Remember to take another deep breath. Breath is refreshing and energizing. You feel vibrantly alive. You have the feeling that you can handle anything, even all of those thoughts that come in. Never mind, I can just sit here and have a deep breath. And watch the body. Notice the posture. Notice the rising and the falling. Breathing in and breathing out is so natural, so good, just to watch the body breathe. Sitting there with no problems, nothing to do and no place to go, and just watch the breathing. Be joyful for just a moment. Everything is okay right now. Everything is fine. And remember to take another deep breath, and let this one be refreshing. Let this breath be nourishing. So that you begin to feel deeply alive. Allow the body to become alive and alert, open to sensory input. Feel the touch of the cloth, feel the sitting on the chair. Know where your feet are, hands are. Give yourself permission to just relax, just relax. No worries about the thoughts, just relax. Remember to take another deep breath. Wow, this is a good one. Oh, this feels so good, so relaxing, so vitalizing. And so now, when you're ready, let the eyes drift open. Let a smile come on your face, recognizing that you can do this, if you remember. Just practice this over and over again. We've been doing this for about 10 minutes, a little bit longer than 10 minutes, and that's all you need, is just 10 minutes. Several times a day, then go off and complain all you want to. But for 10 minutes, practice this breathing. Remember, you take a deep breath and be here with the body, having the thoughts, paying attention to the body, how the air feels, how the rise, how the fall.— how the touch of the cloth, the posture of the sitting. Just practice that. Don't worry about the thoughts. Don't try to make a change. The change that you're making is to remember to take a long deep breath. So it'd be good if you actually— we've got this tape recorded, or this video recorded, we don't use tape anymore— and play this a couple of times a day. Fast forward up until this exercise that we played and just listen to it. And remind yourself over and over again to take a nice long deep breath. Okay. This is the way to get started. Instead of complaining about what's not good enough, let this be good enough. Okay. Okay. All right, you think you can do this? Yes, because we've done it one time. You can get through, uh, the video recording out and fast forward to the place where we did this, about 30 minutes in. Yeah, you can do this. I know you can. There, how hard you try to convince me that you're— you can't do it, I know you can do it. I just saw you do.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay, okay, okay. So do this 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 times a day, and the rest of the time don't worry about anything. Don't worry about, "Oh, I'm not good enough." Throughout the day you can say, "Oh, well, I'll go get relaxed later when.

**Speaker B:** I practice.".

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. It's getting you established in a practice. And so I've given you this little guided meditation today. For you to do this over and over again, guide your way through this until you can remember yourself to take that deep breath. Okay. Okay. Wow, this is marvelous! Have you noticed that now you're no longer complaining, "Oh, poor me, I can't do it, I mean, those results are there." No, right now you're not. Just this little exercise and look how you've calmed down. So even after we're not doing it, you're not back into bitching and moaning again. Right now you're okay. Yeah. Congratulations, you're okay right now. Yeah. Yeah, well, congratulate yourself.

**Speaker B:** You're okay right now. That's fake. I don't like lying to myself.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not fake. You just did it.

**Speaker B:** I don't feel like— Okay, congratulations me. That doesn't make me.

**Speaker A:** Feel happy. Well, it makes you feel successful.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't make me feel successful. It makes me feel like I'm lying to myself.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, now you're back into it. I just saw you flip.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because congratulating myself is lying to myself.

**Speaker A:** Well, then find a better word for you to be satisfied. And in fact, there's a rule in there someplace that says thou shalt not congratulate yourself. Okay. Those are the rules that you have, and you can dispense with those rules for a little while and just pay attention to your breathing. I saw you do it. I can congratulate you because I saw you do it. You're reluctant to congratulate yourself because ain't nothing good enough for you. Until you practice deep breathing and letting it be good enough. This breath is good enough. Yeah, I know that you can complain. You've been complaining for many, many years. You're really excellent at complaining. I congratulate you for how big a what a wonderful complainer you are. Okay, wow, I got one in. So now you can just sit and relax and allow yourself to know that you can relax. We just did it for 10 minutes, 15 minutes. Do it again. Go practice this now several times a day for 2 or 3 days, and then give me a call again to tell me how good you.

**Speaker B:** Feel.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. We'll see you later then. Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk is a guided dialogue and meditation between a teacher (Speaker A, likely Dhammarato) and a student (Speaker B) who is deeply stuck in a cycle of repetitive, negative thoughts.

**Core Issue:** The student is trapped in the belief that their painful, repetitive thoughts are permanent and unchanging, leading to frustration and hopelessness. They feel any effort to change is futile because relief is only temporary.

**Teacher's Key Points & Method:**

1.  **The Fundamental Truth of Change (Anicca):** The teacher repeatedly emphasizes that **everything is in constant change**, even repetitive thoughts. The student's belief in permanence is the primary obstacle to progress.
2.  **The "Kitchen & Trash" Analogy:** The mind is like a kitchen; using it (thinking, living) naturally generates "trash" (unwanted thoughts). The practice isn't to stop using the kitchen, but to **repeatedly take out the trash**. The work is ongoing.
3.  **Start Small & "Good Enough":** The student demands a complete, permanent solution. The teacher insists on starting with what is possible: **a single breath** that feels "good enough." The goal is to accumulate many small moments of peace (5 seconds, 15 seconds, etc.) rather than seeking one big transformation.
4.  **Interrupting the Habit of Judgment:** The teacher identifies the student's core habit as **judgment**—judging thoughts as bad, and judging their own efforts as "not good enough." The practice is to notice this judgmental state without adding more judgment.
5.  **Guided Meditation (Anapanasati):** To break the intellectual debate, the teacher leads a practical meditation:
    *   Focus on the **physical sensation of breathing** (rising/falling chest).
    *   Notice the **body's posture** and touch points (clothing, chair).
    *   Use the breath as an anchor to return to the present moment, **away from the mental commentary**.
    *   The instruction is simple: "Never mind, start again." Each breath is a new beginning.

**The Dynamic:** The talk is a real-time demonstration of the student's resistant mind pattern. Every suggestion from the teacher is met with a "Yes, but..." rebuttal. The teacher patiently dismantles these objections by pointing out the student's underlying assumptions (desire for permanence, perfectionism, judgment) and repeatedly redirects attention to direct, simple experience.

**Conclusion:** The teacher gives the student a concrete assignment: to practice this short guided meditation several times a day. The ultimate goal is not to eliminate thoughts forever, but to **change one's relationship to them**—to see their impermanent nature and develop the skill of gently returning to the anchor of the present moment, thereby finding peace *within* the changing flow of experience, not outside of it.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speaker (A) uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the teaching that **everything is constantly changing** and to address the listener's (B) feeling of being stuck in repetitive, negative thought patterns.

Here are the primary metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Musical Performance**
*   **Metaphor:** A musician playing a major piece (sonata/concerto) dozens of times.
*   **Purpose:** To challenge the idea of exact repetition. Speaker A argues that even a rehearsed performance is slightly different each time, just as a recurring thought is never *exactly* the same because the context (the mind, the moment) is always changing.

### 2. **The Vinyl Record**
*   **Metaphor:** A vinyl record being played repeatedly.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate **impermanence and inevitable change**. Each play wears the record down slightly; it deteriorates. This reinforces the core point that nothing is static—even something designed for repetition changes and is eventually worn out.

### 3. **The Cook in the Kitchen**
*   **Metaphor:** A cook who stops cooking because she hates dealing with the inevitable trash (onion peels, packaging) that the process creates.
*   **Purpose:** This is the central and most extended metaphor. It represents **the mind in use**.
    *   **Cooking** = Using the mind, thinking, living.
    *   **Trash/Garbage** = Unwanted, repetitive, or negative thoughts.
    *   **Taking out the trash** = The mindful practice of acknowledging and letting go of those thoughts.
    *   The key lesson: The use of the kitchen (mind) *naturally generates* garbage (unwanted thoughts). The solution isn't to stop using the kitchen (which Speaker A equates to a kind of suicide), but to **repeatedly and willingly take out the trash** as a normal part of the process.

### 4. **The Security System**
*   **Metaphor:** A security light in the front yard that turns on whenever there's motion (an intruder or a bird).
*   **Purpose:** To reframe the unwanted thoughts. Speaker A suggests the listener installed this "security system" (the habit of anxious or judgmental thinking) for a reason—perhaps as a protective mechanism. The lights (thoughts) going off are not inherently bad; they are just the system operating. The "choice" is in how one reacts to the alarm—with hatred or with understanding.

### 5. **Hardware vs. Software**
*   **Metaphor:** The difference between a computer's hardware (fixed) and its software (changeable).
*   **Purpose:** To make a distinction between the mind's fundamental capacity (**hardware**—which Speaker A implies is not "broken") and its **habits and patterns (**software**). The argument is that the "software" of habitual negative thinking *can* be changed, even if it feels ingrained.

### 6. **Stepping in Crap**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** A reference to the Buddha's core teaching about *dukkha* (suffering/stress).
*   **Purpose:** To contrast two paths. The typical way is to see suffering, hate it, and complain—which is just "stepping in crap" and then adding more suffering on top. The Buddha's way is to see suffering and **"stop it, come out of it, don't put your foot there."** It’s a call to active change rather than passive complaint.

### 7. **The Guided Breath (The Practical "Story")**
*   While not a traditional story, Speaker A constructs a **new, immediate narrative experience** for the listener. They guide them through a series of deep breaths, creating a "story" in the present moment where:
    *   Each breath is "good enough."
    *   For a few seconds, the repetitive thoughts are not dominant.
    *   The listener is shown they *can* achieve small moments of change and presence.
    *   This practical exercise is the culmination of all the metaphors, demonstrating that change is possible in tiny, incremental choices (like taking a single satisfying breath).

**Overall Theme:** All these metaphors and stories work together to combat the listener's core belief in **permanence and helplessness** ("my thoughts never change"). They illustrate **impermanence**, frame the problem as a **manageable process** (like kitchen chores), and advocate for **small, repeated actions** as the path to change, rather than waiting for a single, large transformation.
