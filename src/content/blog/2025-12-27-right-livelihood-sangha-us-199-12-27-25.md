### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello Sangha, this is Mikey speaking. I was not able to be present for the recording of this call, and there ended up being a few issues with the recording. It's not easy to hear or understand what is being said by Dhammarato. So, we decided we're going to go ahead and upload this recording anyways. You may need to raise the volume or listen to this in a very quiet environment. With that out of the way, enjoy the call.

**Speaker B:** All right, so today, uh, is what, the 27th of December? The year is almost finished, and it's, uh, 9 AM. And today we're going to be talking about Right Livelihood. Now if you'll notice, the video here is different. Mikey normally helps me get to get out on the porch, but now I'm doing it. I think everybody knows what tapes I'm giving out. It's been good for about 80 years. We don't. So today, let's talk about right livelihood. And the first and most important to say about right livelihood is, is that it does not belong with rules or precepts. Right livelihood has to be done only with one's own wisdom. Now we have some, let us say, some guidelines with that. Basically, one has to choose for himself. Now there are a number of professions that we could say, even because they inherently harm people, we would automatically assume through a bit of investigation, because the profession or the job itself has to do with harming other people, that you yourself would probably not want to have that job as like-minded women. So the Anagami earlier, before the video recorder came on, would be to compare an Anagami general with a cook whose job is to peel potatoes, and which one is much more likely to have right language. But the answer is the cook is not going to stay Potato Peeler for very long. In fact, they do a lot of rotation, and the next thing you know, that kid's going to have a gun in his hand Instead, so, and it depends upon the armies. Some armies have, let us say, pay billets or particular places for them. Still, in the Russian Army, the cook is much more likely to get a gun tomorrow than he is to be peeling potatoes tomorrow. So in that regard, staying away from the military altogether may be the right thing to do. Now, uh, in the, uh, Anguttara Nikaya, in the, uh, I think it's in the fives, it actually has 5 professions that automatically have wrong livelihood. And the first one is the top of the list is dealing with weapons. Another one would be dealing with any form of human trafficking, white slavery, or any kind of slavery, or in fact even bosses and factories misuse and mistreat employees. In fact, that's very common in the United States. Keeping the salaries low so people need that job. Uh, if people were properly paid, they could leave that job easily, go live for a couple years, and then go back and have another high-paying job and live easy. But the way that the whole system is set up is abuse, with a kind of slavery or indentured servitude. Another form would be with— and by the way, we could put that with animals also. But the third one then would be actually dealing with meat in any form. Now, in Thailand, we would say that if the neighbor brought a covered dish over to the house that had meat in it then that would not be considered wrong livelihood. Uh, restaurateurs and people who are serving food, cooking food for others, um, dealing with meat in the marketplace, uh, cutting big pieces of meat— Avatar, uh, the word would be a meat factory. Or it depends upon even the farmers who raise their animals for slaughter would be not Anagami, and that you could say then that the 10-year-old daughter of that farmer, that's wrong livelihood, when Daddy takes her favorite piglet and slaughters it. I know another story about that, and this story is, is that in the Jewish tradition they have certain, uh, a kind of a rabbi who uses a particular kind of knife in a particular way so that the meat becomes kosher. And the situation is, is that there's this lamb that comes to the slaughter place, and the rabbi looks directly in the face of this lamb, and suddenly he realizes that what he's about to do is wrong, to kill that lamb. And so he puts down that knife, and if it really gets him, he's going to get rid of that knife and stop doing that profession. So dealing with meat That would be the third one. The fourth one would be dealing with intoxicants, drug runners, alcohol, things like this. Now here's a really interesting position because I've got a student who was in this, and that is that he was a bartender, but his job as a bartender was much more of dealing with, um, you could say the drunks that are sitting at the bar. And so he wound up being more of a psychologist than a barkeep. Now, a barkeep, his job is to sell whiskey, sell goods, but a good bartender is going to be there to be the psychotherapist that the drunk would never go to. Now we've got to think about that. Would that be— and if you were in that bar keeping, would you in fact have that in mind? My job here is to take care of people, not sell booze. The last one would be dealing with poisons, and that the question then would be, well, what about the farmers who put out pesticides? Could we not in fact have a whole system to where we have insects and plants in harmony with each other, having what is a large collection of ladybugs so that the, uh, aphids and whatnot don't eat all of our crops. But if we automatically go and just poison everything, that's out of greed. So those are the 5. And then they contact them again. Um, uh, slavery of any sort, dealing with meat, dealing with alcohol and dealing with poisons. All of those have kind of some— this is a part of wisdom. It's not really precepts, thou shalt not, but rather look at what you're doing. And so it's always a point of wisdom. And, um, if we, uh, can look at that, we can say, well, wait a minute, there's a whole lot of places that deal with weapons. Uh, not just weapons in the sense of, uh, being a gunrunner, but you're a gun store. Or being the sheriff, or being any police officer that's armed. But you can take that a little bit further. As you said, what happens with the people that the cops nab is they take them to detectives and then ultimately judges, and then prisons and prison wards. All that entire profession has to do with using weapons. And so any of it and all of it would be not right livelihood. Now we're going to say, well, what is livelihood? It's correct. And the answer to that is maybe not much, but we have to decide that for ourselves. And that there are some guides that are in other sutras. One of them is about buying and selling. So a merchant would not be right livelihood if he buys over here to sell over there, or marketing. Why is that not right livelihood? Is because it always has deception. It has lying, it has covering up, it's a profit motive, and all of that. So now let's, uh, look at something that would be considered likelihood. In Sutta number 81, the Sati Kara Sutta, Gothikara was a potter, and that what he would do to get his mud, when he would go to the riverbank where otters and rats and snakes and whatnot had dug holes, and their mud out of the hole so that he would just pick it up. In other words, he didn't even dig. He just gathered mud that the animals had placed for him. And so he'd go up and down the riverbank and get enough mud for the day, and he would make pottery out of it. Now, the sutra doesn't talk about him having a pottery wheel or a kiln or any of that kind of stuff. So we assume that he hand-shaped the potter and just let it dry in the sun, so it's not going to be permanent. And then, um, he had a sign, and the sign said, um, take what you need and pay what you want to pay for it, pay what you think it's worth. And uses that as an example of right livelihood because it shows that he, uh, in fact was not so greedy as to have a really huge pottery store because he wouldn't dig for the mud. He'd only collect it from the animals that had.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker B:** And that, uh, Some of you would say, well, if he did that, somebody in the town is going to go to his house and take my Dari and pay nothing for it and open up a shop. I think everybody in town was all about it. I don't think they do that more than once or twice, but he was operating with the the position that everything is already okay and that I'll get enough money. And by the way, um, the story is, is that he had either a mother or he had, uh, two parents, both of them blind, and that he cared for his mother and father with the little bit of income that he received from being a potter. So I asked maybe Ivan. Ivan, what do you think about Ghotikara? Ghotikara?

**Speaker D:** Sorry, I don't— I don't— can you say that again?

**Speaker B:** Ghotikara was a Anicca, who took off the riverbank where animals had dug it up. So he didn't dig, made pottery.

**Speaker E:** And.

**Speaker B:** Then he sold it out for sale with a sign saying, take what you need and pay what it's worth.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, I heard of that. Yeah, yeah, I remember that one. Yeah. What do I think? I don't know. Like, I think that's really awesome. I couldn't do that.

**Speaker B:** You can't? Why not?

**Speaker E:** He.

**Speaker F:** Was a layperson.

**Speaker D:** I know, I know. I'm just speaking like from my experience here, the way I see it. For me.

**Speaker B:** In other words, what you're saying, Ivan, is you don't have the trust to do that.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** I don't. You don't? Okay, so take that as a point. So, Arahant, what do you think? Do you, do you have the a reality that you can manage when people only give you what they want to give you?

**Speaker G:** Only if I have a good cushion already, a good money cushion.

**Speaker C:** What do you mean?

**Speaker G:** Only if I had a good cushion already to not depend on the next day. But I thought of doing things like that with activities I'd like. For example, I like doing ice baths and offering that to people as voluntary donation. But because I don't need the money, if I had to sustain a family, I wouldn't have the trust either.

**Speaker B:** Mr. Van, uh, Potato is breaking up. Can you repeat what he said? Maybe I can hear you better.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, he said if he had a cushion, like a financial cushion, then it would be okay. Like if you had money saved up, that would as a sort of backup in case.

**Speaker B:** I like that idea. Absolutely, that's an excellent way of looking at it, which means then that when you do have income, you don't spend it. You keep it as a cushion. Not, not in the sense of gathering up wealth, but rather just having an easy cushion. So I like that, Potato. Let's have an easy cushion so that we don't live day to day. And look how many people in America, they say, live from what they call paycheck to paycheck. Wouldn't it be wise for those people to stop living paycheck to paycheck and stop spending all of the money in that paycheck and start building up a bit of a cushion. What they talk about is having money for a rainy day. That's very wise. Thanks for mentioning it. So then, what do you think?

**Speaker H:** I think, yeah, I think it would be situational. It would be dependent on the situation. Like in the example, the guy who was a potter was supporting his parents who were old or sick. Maybe they lived somewhere rural. Maybe they had a little hut or a house or whatever that they lived in. So living costs probably weren't that high. Whereas if you live in a big modern city and you've got expensive, you've got rent to pay and bills to pay and all that stuff, then I think the sort of the application of the model of I'm just going to make a few pots with some mud and then see what people want to pay me for them might not be as applicable an idea.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, maybe in fact, uh, the Gotaka actually lived in a hovel. He was a poor man. It didn't say, it just said his house. But what we know from other suttas is having just adequate housing. And yet, uh, in especially the United States, they don't build adequate housing. They build mansions and you got to pay for hundreds and thousands of dollars when in fact a house maybe $7,000 or $8,000 depends upon where you put it. And a lot of people are going in that direction to have cheap housing rather than living in a mansion and, and having high rent to pay. Allow us then to have that cushion that, uh, Arahant is about.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, I mean, even here in Hanoi, over the past 3 years, apartment prices have gone up by 400%. So your average, like, little studio apartment, like a basic bottom-of-the-ladder apartment, is like a few hundred thousand dollars. Now, which is crazy money. But yeah, I agree, if you had a home sort of paid off, so expenses weren't that high, then that sort of model might be more easily doable in terms of not sort of needing so much income.

**Speaker B:** So right livelihood then has a whole lot to do with frugality. Rather than having a big mansion with big expenses and then having to get big money, worrying big money so that you can pay big expenses, it's better to live easy, to live cheap. But before I became a monk, when I was living in Thailand— I actually lived for years in India and in Thailand, really, really cheap, what back then we called Dhamma bunks. And most of the places that I lived was in ashrams and Wants in places like that. What, uh, Thaibodhaya stayed there for nearly a year, uh, and so there's a lot of places that you can live for free and you don't have to be ordained. You just, you know, kind of stay there, move in. Eventually the abbot will give you a room, but until he does, you can sleep on the floor. But Hanoi, I can see, but it's quite a big city now. The economy is changing there. Maybe it's time to move out of town into the suburbs or into the countryside, because land is always— especially in places like Thailand and housing.

**Speaker C:** Large people.

**Speaker B:** So Christina, what do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** It sounds like I've joined in an interesting talk about wanting maybe more than we need.

**Speaker B:** This is why I'm talking about it as a point of wisdom. This is not a set of rules. This is not precepts. This is you figuring out for you what to do to have a happy life.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, there's a thought experiment that sometimes You know, if you had $1 million or if you had all the money in the world, what would you do? Like, and it's supposed to help people sort through what kind of career path they want if money wasn't an object.

**Speaker C:** Well, I don't know if that's the use. Money isn't an object.

**Speaker B:** So what can you do then with the money that you have? Because it's not the money itself. Is how do you feel about it? Do you feel wealthy? But in fact, this is part of the dialogue that I'm— that I've— you've probably heard me teach, so I don't— and that is, is that when we feel safe, secure, and comfortable and satisfied, that session grows into feeling successful. And that feeling of being successful goes into the feeling of being wealthy. So cultivate, dude, that you're a wealthy lady. And in fact, this is what generosity is based upon. Poor people and skinflints and Cheap Charlie, they're not generous because they need.

**Speaker H:** But.

**Speaker B:** If you have the attitude of being wealthy, then, oh, it's nothing. Yeah, okay, my brother comes and he wants $500. Yeah, sure, I can give him 50 baht. Actually, that's supposed to be about $1,700. But in case, you know, somebody needs something, be wealthy enough so that you can help the people that you know. Now, having all the money in the world is— who did you take it from? Having all the money in the world sounds like the worst part of all of the wrong livelihoods. You say you had to steal money from 7 or 8 billion people. So let's look at having all the money in the world, which is just a concept. And let's take it into the concept of feeling wealthy. What do you think about that?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's good to flip the perspective that way, to start with the cup full or fulfilled. I don't know. It's just interesting to point it the other way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because you're also in your mind state, you've got plenty of money. Then in fact, I actually missed Mikey coming to borrow money because now he's got a work visa and he's working at the school. He's been going to that same school first as a student then as a computer janitor, and now he's actually teaching classes. And the downside of that is he doesn't come make money from me anymore. But when he did, I'd always give him 1,000 baht. Oh, he's still here. Here's 1,000 baht, take, you know. So always being generous. With your friends. Be generous with people. But people would say, well, where did Dhammarato get all that money? The answer is Social Security. That's in fact a kind of right livelihood. Why? Because I just take it from the government. They give it to me. I sometimes have to jump through some some hoops or what things, send papers and whatnot. But generally the money just shows up and all I have to do is not spend it.

**Speaker E:** Well, that's the practice too, because not, you know, when you do have— right, right. Yeah, actually, Arahant and I were talking about that earlier today. I just told him to join about having all the money in the world and what would you do. But that's not the way to look at it.

**Speaker B:** Well, you probably do anything you need, but your mentality started off when you were a child. You see, every child except for Some who are in the position of knowing that they're going to inherit great wealth because Daddy— if Daddy's got so much money, that means that he's spending all of his time with his money and not with you as a child. So rich daddy is a curse because he cares more about his money than he does his children. But If you have a parent who really cares about you, they're probably money-grubbing. And so you get in the money-grubbing habit because you got that money-grubbing habit from Mommy and Daddy. And you still have, no matter how much money now, Christina, you still got that money-grubbing habit.

**Speaker C:** There's.

**Speaker B:** Never enough. In fact, I bet you could live happily on half the money that you earn. With the other hand, Anicca and potatoes are sad.

**Speaker I:** But Dhammarato, there's a plan.

**Speaker F:** The plan is you get the money, then you move to Thailand, you buy an Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's my plan.

**Speaker E:** No, that's the plan.

**Speaker B:** Actually, it wasn't my plan, it was Tam's plan. And some of that Social Security money that had piled up, and we now have a 3-bedroom— excuse me, a 3-unit apartment. One has 2 bedrooms and 2 bedrooms each, and the rent from that will take care of her and Kitty and me for the rest of my life. So I don't even need the Social Security anymore because we've got property now. But we built the house. When I say build the house, I'm talking about we got the land and then we started— actually, once, um, cousin came down and actually did the building. So we did that on the cheap, but he did a really good job. So, uh, you don't even handle— Pam handles the money. You don't even handle the money.

**Speaker I:** Uh, Pam handles the money.

**Speaker B:** That's right, I don't handle the money. When she would loan, uh, she would, a long time ago we had a loan of 150,000 baht. The guy paid back 10,000 baht a month and she would put that in the wallet. And that wallet then is what I would give money to, uh, to Mikey for all of his living expenses. But now that loan has been paid off, I don't have any money at all. I think there's like 200 baht in my billfold, and I haven't seen any real money in probably 2 years. She does it all. Which, by the way, that's also in the suttas for a man to just let his wife have the money. Just give it all to her. Why? Because she's unlikely to spend it on things that she don't need the way that you would. You have to be careful not to have a wife that's a shopaholic so that she buys all the stuff she wants. We'll run it together. It can be fruitful. So, Arahant, what do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** Nothing to say. I agree. I've been reflecting on it while you guys are talking.

**Speaker H:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we can go back to about money. Don't worry, be happy. Don't spend any money and you're happy. So Edward, Edward W., what do you think?

**Speaker I:** Uh, also reflecting, it is a topic that I reflect on, and I guess the focus is for me that where does the lifestyle go? Where will my lifestyle go If I let the livelihood go in the direction of giving the pottery away for whatever people want to give. So yeah, the lifestyle has to match that. I live in an Anagami, whatever, you know, I rent in an expensive city. I have a job that, you know, It's definitely not set up like the Potter. But if you arrange a lifestyle over time where you could do something like that, I also reflect on Murado. I don't remember the last time you asked for money for all these teaching services. Somewhere deep, maybe on the Open Sangha Foundation website with multiple clicks, you might see something about dana. But look at what you've done with all the quote-unquote services you've provided. So, uh, for, you know, Mr. Ben, for you to say it's not feasible, I, I understand that too, but that's from the perspective of having a lot of expenses and an expensive lifestyle. But if you're more free with where the lifestyle might go, then you can set up shop and you can teach hundreds and hundreds of people for free in a manner that other people, they They get paid a lot of money for what Dhammarato has done. He sits and he teleworks. Dhammarato quote-unquote teleworks, you know, and people are charging a high fee, but people give him, I guess, whatever they want to give him. So that's what I reflect on is where can my lifestyle head such that I might be able to provide whatever services I provide in a manner that's more Uh, here, have them have the services and let me have something in return if you feel it's worthy of that.

**Speaker B:** Well, let me answer you on that. First off, the Open Sangha Foundation does have a place for people, but, um, actually from the very beginning We've had enough money now, Open Sangha Foundation, to take care of all the little expenses of a website. For instance, the provider and some of the plugins that we purchased and other things like that. But that's the only money kind of thing that we have, and it's certainly not enough money just the same amount. In fact, it's been sitting there, is about $3,500, and that's been— I mean, we will go for years, I think, with just a few donations from time to time, uh, to keep the, uh, we're going. So there's nothing to it, easy peasy. Not trying to make any money off of the website. Just trying to keep it going. Uh, the other point about, uh, not charging, I'll talk about that in a couple minutes. Uh, so who do we have left here? What do you have to say? Uh, me? Did you say Trevor? Yes, Mr. Trevor, what do you have to say?

**Speaker J:** Yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot, just right livelihood and how it kind of motivates how I found my career path and everything like that. I've mainly been reflecting on what is wrong livelihood and what has negative.

**Speaker C:** Ethics.

**Speaker J:** Like socially or environmentally. And like, after getting out of college, I kind of really avoided getting basically the same reasons. And I eventually found myself working in teaching for adults with developmental disabilities. And I found it a lot more rewarding, even though the pay isn't really that high. But I have found that when you trust kind of in— I don't know if you trust in your— if I exactly trusted in myself, but more like trusted in the general situation of things work out. But I think it did eventually. Like, I have a pretty stable thing, and I think it's kind of because, like, I made the right choice there.

**Speaker B:** Okay. What I would have to say about that is that it's one of each individual But the way to look at it is, um, does your livelihood— can you have your livelihood set up so that it doesn't cause you or anybody else any Dukkha, any dissatisfaction? So if you're not just— if you are dissatisfied with your job Why are you there? But if you are satisfied with your job, now it's time to look at: does this job cause harm anywhere? It's possible, I suppose, that a policeman could be satisfied with his job, but it's probably not possible for it to not harm anybody. I have heard this situation where, uh, cops in even Anagami said they never drew their gun, they never used handcuffs, that they were able to do the job of the policeman without ever harassing anybody, pulling anybody over. That's basically the way the cops in Thailand operate. But whatever job that you have, make it easy on the people that you have your job with. And things that I would generally advise for everybody is, instead of being a very good employee doing a very good job, merit system-wise, my recommendation would be best with your immediate boss and his boss. Be best friends with your boss. You'll get away with anything if you're his best friend. But most of them don't have best friends. Most of the bosses have competitors below them and above them. And so being good friends with your boss is always a good idea. That way you don't cause him any grief and he doesn't cause you any grief either. Alex, hello friend!

**Speaker C:** Hello Dhammarato, how are you?

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm taking it easy. I didn't make it out to the port.

**Speaker C:** Good, glad to see you're taking it easy.

**Speaker B:** So are you going to go to Antarctica?

**Speaker C:** Not sure yet. I actually started doing what we're talking about. I got friends that are out there and they're looking for different things to be done with small businesses they have and such. And so through word of mouth, I just hear what they want done and then let them pay what they want to pay right now. And it appears to be working out pretty well for me because I have good friends. I'm not concerned about whether or not they're going to pay me or whether they'll pay me too little or too much or anything like that. I know that they'll pay what they see fit to pay for, you know, what it is that I provide them and whatnot. And I'm quite happy with that arrangement. It's almost like they wrote it down for a reason.

**Speaker B:** All right, so last thing, let's change the topic slightly, going actually kind of close to what Edward was talking about, and that is let's look at Western Buddhism in the guise of what is right livelihood. Now, uh, there are retreats at a fixed price. Then a few, uh, most of them go to a second level, and that is a fixed price, but they also have scholarships and discounts. And then the third model is the model of separating it out. Like, um, um, the, the teacher doesn't work at or for the retreat center, and so center charges money, room and board for the retreat, and then the teacher has Dharma. Uh, the first kind is the way that they do it in Thailand, and also in all of the Western Buddhist wats that I've been to, the way that they do it is that they do have a donation box, but you're probably going to have to go look for it or ask somebody where. But the monks do not solicit money. And then the last one is where somebody is teaching the Dhamma, spreading the Dharma, but refuses to deport. Now let's go back to the first one, and that is, uh, the way that, uh, it's most business, and that would be Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein at Spirit Rock, and, um, the Berry Center in Massachusetts. And also Berry Center owns Wisdom Publications, and they're in business. They are in the business of the Dharma. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is directly against that. In many places in the teaching, it says that the Dhamma is priceless. It cannot be sold. But in fact, if they're selling Dhamma, it winds up being like, let us say, spoiled meat. It's not worth having. And yet this is what you'll find with most of the retreat centers. Now, the model of, um, the, the room and board is charged for what the, uh, the teacher wants. Uh, Teacher Donna, um, to be honest with you, at one time I was very proud of being able to give a Dhamma talk. So that, uh, uh, we could solicit and get some money in. Talk all about this and that and what is this thing, and everybody's saying, yeah, yeah, we'll pay you some money. But I don't do that anymore. Um, but they— the Dhamma talk is almost always at the end. Now there's a special case of Gomanka. I don't know if any of you have done a Goenka retreat, but the way that they say it is new students are free of charge, but only old students have to pay. Except that the last day of the retreat, something happens and magically all the new students are now to the end of the retreat, old students, and they have to pay to get out of the retreat. It's almost charlatan. My uncle, the story when I was young, and, uh, the story that he told me always reminded me of the Goenka retreats. And that was his day. It was a, uh, he went to a a county fair where they had a tent set up that had all kinds of things that you could go look at inside the tent, and it's admission. And the problem was, is that you couldn't get out of there without paying a nickel. You could get in for free, but you couldn't get out. And my uncle says what he did is he had a pocket knife, a penknife, and he cut that tent and he made his own exit. And he didn't pay the nickel. Well, what do you think about Goenka's retreats doing it that way? They sound like that's right livelihood and all, uh, to, uh, say that the first retreat's free, but that first retreat, once you've taken it, now you owe for it. Um, the, the, uh, the at the watch is much better, to where they don't talk about money at all. I don't hear— I've never heard all the watch that I've been to, especially a watch store in Moab. Nobody— I don't even know that I lived in Moab for years and I don't know where the poor box was. I don't know where— I knew where the one was in at White Greensboro, but the one at White Greensboro was hidden behind many of the Buddha statues. You had to know where it was in order to be able to put money in it. And when I started doing retreats there, I told the people if they wanted to make a donation that they could put money in box. Well, guess what? When we went to open the box, Achan, uh, uh, Mahasamsara, he didn't know where the key was. We had to break into the box. It'd been so long since he had opened that box that he didn't even know how to open it. So we had to break the lock. Um, and so this is, this is the way criminally done. And that in America, I know, but I can also see that enough in Wat Soan Nok, that all of these wats have patrons or donors. Now, what that means is, is that there's going to be a young man who was a monk for a couple years And then he went back to his family and worked in their family business, but he was always at the wat. He cared enough about the wat that he was making sure that the wat was taken care of. Wat Soan Mok has donors, some of whom live in Bangkok, and they're going to make sure that that wat has everything that it needs. And so nobody has ever asked for any money at all because the generosity It's been built in for years and years. What I do is that I don't take money. What I do instead is talk about the duty to the Dhamma, that once you have learned the Dhamma from me, you have a duty to live that Dhamma, and the duty is kind of special. You can take students of your own in a very soft way, not in a formalized way, but not charging them. But you don't take them as students, rather they will come to you. So if your friends ask you, why are you so happy all the time? Christina, you're just such a joy to be around. How is that possible? And then you can say, oh well, I've got some Dharma I can talk to you about. Maybe you can have some of that joy too. Or the other way of talking about it is paying it forward as opposed to paying it back. And we do that in our society in the form of parents who raise their children not expecting the children to take care of them. But rather that the child's duty is to the next generation. So you have children, uh, that child will grow up and then they'll have children, and you passing skills on to the next generation. Now the Buddha actually said, when asked, why do you teach this for future generations? For those who will come. He did not say, maybe he did not say, for the benefit and the welfare of all beings. He did not put that word all in there that the Mahayana do, that Bodhisattva vow, and may all beings be happy. Guess where that all is anyway, Potato? When you say, 'All beings, may all beings be happy,' what all are you talking about?

**Speaker G:** My imagination. My imagination.

**Speaker B:** Yes, in your imagination. All is in your head. That's where all of those beings that you want to be happy. So you can make all beings be happy by just Being happy, don't worry, be happy, and you've got all beings happy. And so this is the talk that I have today, is that is freely given. The Buddha never charged money for anybody. In fact, he set up the Sangha so that the Sangha could take care of itself, and it's been taking care of it's 2,500 years. Think about it like this: there are more Buddhist nuns and monks in robes on Earth right now than all of the world's collected military in uniform. Wow. There are more Buddhist amongst 400,000 or more in Thailand alone. The Thai government could support an army of 400,000 people? I don't think so. So now the country's only about 70 million, and the United States— no, the United States, the West, is slow on this. But yeah, in China and many Asian places have hundreds of thousands of monks and nuns inside of their border. And guess what? None of them work. None of them have any problem with right livelihood because they don't have any livelihood at all. You can do the same. You have been told by your culture that you gotta work to eat, and here I'm showing you that 7 or 8 or 9 million people on this planet that prove that wrong. You do not have to work to eat. It's all done through generosity. So that's what really white livelihood is about, is at the core of white livelihood is generosity. So Christina, she's the wealthy lady on the group here, so she's got a lot of generosity to spread around. Everybody begin to think of it like that. You got plenty of money. You may not have but $10,000 in the bank.

**Speaker H:** There's plenty of money.

**Speaker B:** You may not have but $5,000 in the bank. There's plenty of money. You got— you're rich beyond imagination. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, no, I was just thinking about what it feels like when you're giving, that there's like a healing.

**Speaker B:** On it.

**Speaker E:** I'm sorry, what did you say? When one gives, there's like a healing feeling, like there's like a sense of like when you are sharing gratitude or giving something to someone that can feel like healing.

**Speaker B:** And that attitude gives that feeling of well-being. The attitude is wealthy feeling of well-being. Where the richest people in the world, like Elon Musk for instance, right now, he has no well-being. He's a wealthy man. He wants more and more and more. He's got only 20% of Tesla. He wants 5%. That's the problem with wealthy people, is they're not wealthy in their mind. Can you become wealthy? Because wealthy— wealth and generosity It's kind of the same thing. If you were so full of Dharma, it just leaks out all over the place. That's your wealth, is that you're leaking. You don't try to hold it.

**Speaker G:** There's a little Yeah, some people though, they give at the cost of their own well-being.

**Speaker B:** How do you know that? You're looking at it from the outside. When you say from the outside, what? That are too generous, they call it generous to a fault. That's an outside observer, and that outside observer It's the skin-plant. Saying, oh, don't give your money away, Grandma. Grandma is just so happy to give all her money away. Give that money away, Grandma. That money's mine. And Granny was just having a ball giving all that money to all of her family and friends. And it would be wonderful if all of her family and friends had the same attitude about money that she does, and then everybody's going to take care of everybody and nobody needs to care about money at all. Think about that. Foster the feeling of wealth and generosity with all of your friends, and then that group of people will never need any money because they got their friends. It's a different mindset. I know it's completely different. You have to have that feeling No, we've got enough. Wow. And in our Western culture, even rich people will think they don't have enough. The more money they get, the more they want. They even get in competition. The super rich are in competition with each other, trying to get more money and more money and more money. So let's not be in that group of super rich. Let's be wealthy instead. What do you think? Wealthy is the attitude of having more than I need. I've got excess. Let me see where I can spread it around.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Dhammarato, that just made me think about something. So there's this It's a little bit, it's a little bit, it's the same topic of right livelihood, but it has to do with like when you give so much of yourself to like your job and you become so committed to the work that like you give and give and give, and then there's this phenomenon of like burnout where you can't give what you don't have because there's nothing left in the gas tank.

**Speaker B:** That's an interesting word, burned out. The only people who have experienced burnout are the ones who were on fire for a long time until they're completely burned out. But if you're never on fire because you're generous and you're feeling— you've got your potato that's, uh, yesterday or whatever, then you get burned out. You just have more fun with it. There's no such thing as burnout, by the way. There are a few professions that are known for burnout. The number one top of the list is nurses. Did you know that? Did you know that nurses are the ones who burn out the soonest? Why is that? Did you know that during the COVID days that there were so many nurses that got burned out? Why did they get— Christina's a nurse, right? And they died instead. Another group that had a lot of burnout is doctors. Others who have burnout would be teachers, but a big group of those who burn out are social workers. Why do social workers burn out? It's because the people that they take on as clients don't ever do what they were told to do. And so the social worker just really can't talk with their clients because You know, uh, they just keep making the same stupid mistakes over and over again, and the social workers want them to do better. But it's the same thing with nurses. The reason why nurses get burned out is because people go to them to die. You go to a hospital— I mean, then in America for sure, almost everybody who dies, dies in a hospital. Hospital. Did you know that? The only ones who don't die in the hospital are the ones who arrive at the hospital DOA. And the better thing to do is just lay here in bed and die on your own. That way you don't have the nurses burn out. So the easy way to take care of that is don't care. Do your job and care for the person, but don't care about them, because your people are going to die. No matter how good a nurse you are, they're going to die. So if you have the right attitude, you have the right noble teaching of wealth, of the attitude of being wealthy, then you can lose a few thousand friends and still have a few thousand more. You got plenty. Don't think about burnout. Think about stop being on fire. Stop caring so much and just be happy. Go about doing your nursing duties happily. That would be the right livelihood of a nurse, is being able to nurse people happily. So Why don't we wrap this up? I'm going to leave all of you now, and I would like it if you guys would stay and talk to each other about Right Livelihood for a while. Uh, Eric, you can turn the recorders off, uh, soon. Does anybody have any last things to say before I go?

**Speaker F:** I had something I was thinking about.

**Speaker H:** Thank you. Yeah, go for it, Connor.

**Speaker F:** So you brought up that monk, or not the monk, the layperson who was a potter, and I had never heard that story, so I found it like really inspiring, is that he was willing to, you know, live on very little, and that's what gave him the right livelihood. And it made me think that what can really allow us to have the right livelihood regardless of whose shoes we're in. Like, you know, we could be anybody, so to say. Wherever we're at, we can have it here and now if we're willing to less lose what we have and maybe disappoint those around us. Like, if we have like a family, maybe we have to be like the bum who maybe doesn't have what they want.

**Speaker B:** All right, so having what you want or not wanting anything, that's the trick, is to be able to live happily not wanting anything. Or whatever you do want is really, really easy to get. Dukkha is well defined as not having what you want.

**Speaker F:** I like the analogy where Dukkha is like, or I think craving is like, you have what you want and then you lose it. And because you lost it, you feel as though you were pierced with a spike. So to even have it is just the predecessor to being pierced by a spike if you're going to crave after what you want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let us say like Alex, you got your motorcycle stolen.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, she gone.

**Speaker B:** Anagami. You don't have to take care of that thing anymore.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I don't buy tires. One less way to launch myself into traffic. Somebody did me a favor.

**Speaker B:** Oh, whatever your profession is, Connor, and somebody comes and steals it from you, thank them. They've done you an enormous favor. They've taken that off your hands. You don't have to deal with that thing anymore.

**Speaker F:** There's a philosopher that I really like who says that when you lose something, don't think I have lost this. Think it has returned to the giver. And I don't think we have to think of the giver as God. We can just think of the giver as nature itself. Like nature gave us something and nature can take it back. And that's all right.

**Speaker B:** Well, the giver in that case was a member of Hells Angels.

**Speaker I:** Hey, Dhammarato, quick question.

**Speaker B:** Yes, go ahead. When you had Piti early on, were you worried about finances at.

**Speaker C:** All?

**Speaker B:** I have been lucky enough to have, since, since the late 1970s, I haven't worried about my attorney because of your Social Security, right? Well.

**Speaker C:** $1,000 a month.

**Speaker B:** But when I knew that I would retire, I knew that I'd have enough retirement that the Social Security You know, way long years ago when I made Social Security payment, I was making it at the maximum. So now my Social Security income is average or above average. And when Kenny was born, guess what? That's just more Social.

**Speaker C:** Security.

**Speaker B:** So I saw her as an asset, not a liability. Hey, more Uncle Sam money I don't need.

**Speaker F:** Another thing I was thinking about, and I wanted your thoughts on this, Dhammarato, is that you said that there is no all, that this is just kind of like a Mahayana delusion. Now I was thinking, you know, there's sense in that, but also one way that there can be an all is in an expansive mind. So if we say the mind is contracted, then the mind is only what it sets upon. And if the mind is expanded, then the mind is whatever it can set upon.

**Speaker B:** Mind. Okay, you can use expanded and contracted. That's not a bad term to use. So have an expansion of a mind, have a big one, like the Christians would say, have a big heart.

**Speaker F:** And then we don't even have to say it to ourselves like the Mahayanas. We don't have to say, oh, um, I wish if only all beings could be happy and well. We can just say you know, may all beings be happy and well.

**Speaker B:** You can say, I'm really glad all those people are so happy. They're already happy enough. You don't believe me? Go ask them. They'll tell you. Everybody's got all they need, and everybody knows that. They've just been told, well, oh, you're supposed to have more.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, if you ask them at the right time, I'd say most people, they'll just say, uh, oh yeah, like, uh, at the right time they'll just say, oh yeah, I've got exactly what I want, you know, before that thorn comes, or before they see the thorn.

**Speaker B:** Don't think about it in that Mahayana vow kind of things, that, that's not really the teaching of the Buddha. Look at it as the Bodhisattva is one who, uh, is determined to be free. That's what a Bodhisattva really is, is one who is determined to be free. Now there's another type, but he's not really a Bodhisattva. He's a Mahayana Buddhism, who is taking a vow. May— in fact, the vow is that all the other people will become enlightened before me. But what happens? Let us look at it as a gate. What happens when everybody goes through the gate except for the bodhisattvas? What are they going to do? They're going to push and shove each other? No, you go 'You go first. I've already got— I have to be the last one.' Why can't they lock arms and happily skip and jump their way through that gate? And who says that the gate is not an open gate anyway, that people can come and go as they please? The way that they talk about it is that it's a kind of a— you go from one prison to another prison. There's a gate locked. Between the universe and no gate. So thinking about may all beings be happy is like saying.

**Speaker C:** 'There'S a gate.

**Speaker B:** Locked, and it's my job to fix something.' That's not the teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha's idea is that those people are okay, they're none of your business. Your job is to get the all in your own mind fixed.

**Speaker F:** That's what I was thinking. It was like maybe a form of goodwill, like instead of really accomplishing that, just in the moment, if you run into a being, hopefully having goodwill instead of the intention of harm, So any particular being, you know, just having the will, the intention within you, may this being be happy and free. I guess it doesn't have to be like an investment in their future, but an investment in yourself and your intentions to have them steered in a positive direction.

**Speaker B:** Positive direction is not a direction in that sense. It's here we are. There's no direction, there's no going, there's no distance to have, there's no gradual path. It's a sudden path. It's a change of attitude.

**Speaker F:** I see what you mean.

**Speaker B:** I guess like, yeah, you're okay right now.

**Speaker F:** To be steering is kind of just a matter of perspective.

**Speaker B:** Stop having perspectives. Just be okay. Already okay. You don't have to prospect.

**Speaker F:** Well, I guess that's like the right perspective to have, because that is also a perspective, being okay.

**Speaker B:** Up to you. All right, folks, thank you so much. This has been delightful, and I really enjoy it, and I'll see you later.

**Speaker C:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker G:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure that.

**Speaker I:** Arhat and Miss Green.

**Speaker B:** And Potato and Christina will have some really insightful things for you to listen to. So I'm gonna leave and let them take over. See ya.

**Speaker C:** Enjoy your rest, friend.

**Speaker B:** Have a good one.

**Speaker F:** Thank you.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Topic: Right Livelihood (Sammā Ājīva)**
Dhammarato leads a discussion framing Right Livelihood not as a rigid set of rules or precepts, but as a personal application of wisdom. The central question is how to earn a living without causing harm (dukkha) to oneself or others.

### **Key Points Discussed:**

**1. Wisdom, Not Rules:**
*   Right Livelihood is a matter of personal investigation and wisdom, not blind adherence to commandments. One must choose for themselves after considering the consequences of their work.

**2. Guidelines from the Suttas:**
*   The talk references the *Anguttara Nikaya*, which lists five professions considered inherently wrong livelihood due to the harm they cause:
    1.  **Dealing with weapons** (including the military, police, judiciary, and prison systems).
    2.  **Human trafficking and slavery** (extended to include exploitative labor practices that trap people in low-wage jobs).
    3.  **The meat industry** (raising, slaughtering, or selling meat).
    4.  **Dealing with intoxicants** (alcohol, drugs).
    5.  **Dealing with poisons** (e.g., harmful pesticides).
*   **Commerce (buying and selling)** is also questioned, as it often involves deception, markup, and a profit motive.

**3. A Positive Example: Ghotikara the Potter**
*   The sutta example of the layman **Ghotikara** is presented as an ideal. He practiced radical simplicity and trust:
    *   He only collected clay already dug up by animals, avoiding greed.
    *   He made simple, sun-dried pots.
    *   He sold them with a sign: "Take what you need and pay what you want."
    *   He supported his blind parents with this modest, non-exploitative income.
*   The Sangha discusses the feasibility of this model in the modern world, concluding it requires **frugality, a simple lifestyle, and a "financial cushion"** to reduce dependency on income.

**4. The Role of Generosity and Mental Wealth:**
*   The talk shifts from external jobs to internal attitude. True **Right Livelihood is rooted in generosity**.
*   **Cultivate a mindset of "wealth"**—a feeling of having more than enough, of being safe, secure, and satisfied. This inner wealth naturally leads to generosity.
*   This contrasts with the cultural mindset of "never enough," which even afflicts the financially rich.

**5. Application to Modern Buddhism & "Dhamma Business":**
*   Dhammarato critiques modern retreat centers that commercialize the Dhamma by charging fixed fees, comparing it to "selling spoiled meat."
*   He praises the traditional monastic model (Theravada) where teachings are freely given and supported by spontaneous generosity (dana), not prices.
*   His own model: Teach freely and encourage students to "pay it forward" by living the Dhamma and sharing it informally with others, not by charging for teaching.

**6. Practical Advice for Any Job:**
*   Make your work as harmless as possible.
*   Focus on being **satisfied** in your job.
*   Cultivate good relationships, especially with your boss, to create a harmonious work environment.
*   For caregivers (nurses, social workers) prone to burnout: **Care for people without "caring about" them** in an attached way; perform duties with happiness and equanimity.

**7. The Ultimate "Right Livelihood":**
*   The talk concludes by pointing to the monastic Sangha—millions of monks and nuns worldwide—as the ultimate example. They have no "livelihood" in the conventional sense; they live entirely on the generosity of others, proving "you do not have to work to eat."
*   The core of Right Livelihood is **generosity**, fostered by an **attitude of inner wealth and contentment**.

### **Overall Theme:**
The talk reframes Right Livelihood from a checklist of "bad jobs" to a holistic practice. It starts with avoiding obviously harmful trades through wisdom, emphasizes simplifying one's needs to reduce dependency on money, and culminates in cultivating a generous, wealthy mindset. The ultimate goal is to arrange one's life so that it causes minimal harm and maximal happiness, moving towards a spirit of trust and open-handedness exemplified by the Buddha's original community.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The "Easy Cushion" or "Rainy Day Fund":** Used to describe savings that provide financial security and reduce anxiety, allowing for more ethical livelihood choices. It's contrasted with living "paycheck to paycheck."
2.  **Wealth as a Mindset/Attitude:** The speaker repeatedly contrasts being *rich* (having money) with being *wealthy* (feeling you have more than enough). True wealth is presented as an internal feeling of abundance that naturally leads to generosity.
3.  **"Leaking" Dhamma:** Generosity and the sharing of Dhamma are described as a natural overflow from a mind that feels full and wealthy, like a container that leaks because it's so full.
4.  **"Burned Out" vs. "On Fire":** Analyzes professional burnout. It suggests burnout happens to those who are "on fire" with excessive caring and attachment. The solution is not to stop working, but to work with a happy, unattached mind—to "stop being on fire" in a stressful way.
5.  **The "Gate" to Enlightenment:** Used to critique the Mahayana Bodhisattva vow. The speaker pictures enlightened beings politely arguing over who goes through the gate last, suggesting the idea is absurd and that the path is about a sudden change of attitude, not a linear queue.
6.  **"Spoiled Meat":** The Dhamma (teaching) that is sold for a price is compared to spoiled meat—it loses its value and essence.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Kosher Butcher (Rabbi):** A story about a rabbi who, looking into the eyes of a lamb he was about to slaughter, realizes the harm and abandons his profession. This illustrates how direct perception of harm can lead to wisdom and a change in livelihood.
2.  **Ghotikara the Potter (from the Sutta):** The central example of Right Livelihood. Ghotikara only collects mud already dug up by animals, makes simple pots, and sells them with a sign: "Take what you need and pay what you want." He also supports his blind parents. This story embodies non-greed, trust, and simplicity.
3.  **The County Fair Tent (Speaker's Uncle's Story):** A parable about a fair where entry was free but exit cost a nickel. His uncle cut his way out. This story is used to criticize certain retreat models (specifically Goenka's) where a "free" retreat creates an obligation to pay, feeling manipulative and contrary to the spirit of *dana* (generosity).
4.  **The Stolen Motorcycle:** A quick, modern anecdote where a stolen possession is reframed not as a loss, but as a favor—relieving the owner of maintenance, worry, and danger. It illustrates non-attachment.
5.  **Social Security & Property Investment:** The speaker uses his own life as a story: living simply on Social Security, then using savings to build a property that generates sustaining income, allowing him to teach without charging. This is a practical model of creating an "easy cushion."
6.  **The Hidden Donation Box at the Wat:** An anecdote about a monastery where the donation box was so unused and forgotten that the key was lost. This story illustrates the ideal of a monastic economy based on unsolicited generosity from devoted patrons, not on charging for teachings.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks (which act as extended metaphors)**
*   **The Five Wrong Livelihoods:** Presented not as rigid rules but as categories for wisdom-based investigation: dealing in weapons, human trafficking/slavery, meat production, intoxicants, and poisons.
*   **The "Duty to the Dhamma" vs. "Paying Forward":** The ethical return for free teaching is not payment (*paying back*), but living the teachings and sharing them freely with others (*paying forward*), like parents raising children who then raise the next generation.

These metaphors and stories work together to paint a picture of **Right Livelihood as an expression of wisdom, non-greed, and generosity,** deeply connected to one's internal sense of abundance and simplicity, rather than a list of forbidden jobs.
