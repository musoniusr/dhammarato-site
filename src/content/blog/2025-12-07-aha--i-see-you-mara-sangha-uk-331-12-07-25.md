### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, folks. It's Sunday afternoon, December 7th today, and today it's 4 in the afternoon, which is a good time for Europe being in morning time. And so today we're going to be talking about a concept called Mara, Maya. Now, a bit of historical information about Maya in the context of Buddhism is that it's quite frequently used, and almost always is used in a metaphorical sense, but the metaphors tend to look like that it's a personality. And now Maya or Mara, actually the history of the word itself, Mar comes from the word death, and that often Mara is referred to as death. But in Western mythology and religion, they have a concept of a double or Satan, and that Mara, even in the pre-Buddhist times, was never that sort of thing, uh, like we see Satan or the devil as, uh, evil incarnate. All right, so even if Mara was incarnate, he wouldn't necessarily be evil the way that we would think of it as a devil. But we can modify our ideas of devil because the word devil also has a cartoonish kind of quality to it, especially with the idea of having a devil on one shoulder over here and an angel on this shoulder. And that in that regard, the devil is actually just another voice that comes from within. And that's the way to really look at Mara, is that it's something that is within each one of us, not something that's outside, not something that's evil incarnate, or part of the cosmos, nor is there any great big war like Armageddon coming in the future, that all the war that needs to be done can be done right here, right now, without harm. In fact, the war is to stop the harm. In other words, the war is to stop the war. And so we have many examples within culture that talk about the devil in many ways, and we need to really kind of change that into the Buddhist concept of what is Mara, which is often, like I said, used metaphorically but in fact it's more psychological. Now, before the Buddha became enlightened as a Bodhisattva, there was a lot of stories of him having to deal with Mara. In Sutta 4, The Upaya Sutta, where the Buddha was dealing with fear, it talks about it in the sense of Mara would come and he would have fearful thoughts, and so he would become afraid because of the thoughts that he was having, not because of the environment. So I'll give you an example of that, is that I recently saw a video that was talking about the kudzu problem, especially in the southern United States, a plant that came from Japan. And Japan cultivates the plant and uses it for food, etc. But in— and it also had in its natural environment, it had its own enemies, certain birds would eat it and certain insects, etc. Would eat the kudzu, and so it was easily controlled in Japan. But when it was brought to the United States, it was brought by the government in order to, let us say, control the wind and the erosion problems. And the Americans never saw it as food. So now it's overgrown everywhere, and the Westerners still don't eat it. The same, by the way, is true about Asian carp. That carp got into the rivers, and then they had, especially the Mississippi, and then they had all kinds of problems with controlling the carp until they figured out that they could pack it and ship it with ice back to Asia and make a profit on it. By doing so, they also kind of got the Americans to start eating the Asian carp. And then the problem was solved. But back to the kudzu. When I would see farmers walking through the kudzu, the immediate image would be that the farmer would be stepping on a snake in the kudzu. Well, that thought of a snake in the kudzu is what we would refer to as Mara. In other words, the thought that brings on fear when in fact there was no snake in the kudzu. The snake was in the mind. And so that's what the Buddha was dealing with in Sutra 4 in Anagami Nikaya, was ideas that brought on fear for him because he was out in the kudzu thinking about snakes and whatnot instead of actually stepping on one. So, we can think of Mara then as anything. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about Mara in the sense that it is actually the clinging. When one clings, that's Mara. When one is acting, that's Mara. And most specifically, when there is selfishness, that's Mara. You could almost think of it in the sense of I, when I am I, that's Mara, and Mara is reincarnated as a me. Now, this is not just Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's, but it's firmly rooted in Sutra number 50, where Mahamudra said that at one time before, he was in fact Mara. He was in a previous birth. That he was reborn as Mara, and that this idea of me being the devil. Now, in the 1960s, there was a sitcom that was run by— this is very strange about the 1960s, it was actually a whole lot freer in some ways. The guy was named Flip Wilson, He was not only a Black entertainer, but he was a cross-dresser. Both of those things would be problematic today on prime-time television, but in his cross-dressing, he would always talk about the devil made him buy that dress. "The devil made me do it." Well, it was humorous, it was funny, But that's the reality of the situation, except that he would not own that the devil was him, that he was the devil, that Flip Wilson was just a Flip Wilson until he became the devil. So the birth of the self is actually the birth of Mara. Now, Mara also has the definition of death itself. Or in regards to when we think about death, that's where the fear comes from. So fear and Mara are simultaneous. Death and Mara are simultaneous, or the self clinging. Any of those kinds of things, you could go so far as to just say your average ordinary unwholesome thought is Mara. Now the next point is, is that it was not just Buddha dealing with Mara when he was still a Bodhisattva, but that there's an entire collection in the Samyutta Nikaya, Sutta number 4. Out of 57 different collections, number 4 is actually labeled as Mara. And there's more than 20 suttas in there where Mara appears to the Buddha after he was enlightened. This is an important point because most people think that when someone is fully awake, fully enlightened, a Buddha, an Arahant, that they don't get visited by Mara anymore. Well, the suttas right there are proving that that's not the case. But the case was in fact that whenever Mara would come, the Buddha would know it immediately.

**Speaker B:** Aha!

**Speaker A:** I see you, Mara, there you are. And so he would be able to deal with his unwholesome thoughts, deal with his fear immediately, rather than having Mara saddle up beside him and make him feel bad and all of that. So don't think that the Buddha was perfect, but rather think of him as being alert, awake, and fast, so that when Mara would come, he would know it immediately. That's basically all there is to the Buddhist teaching of Mara. Does anybody have any questions about it? Let's go ahead and make this an easy one. Timmo, what do you have to say about this?

**Speaker C:** I was wondering if there's a point to distinguishing between Mara being the unwholesome thought itself or it being the reason for the unwholesome thought? Both, yes. But is there a point to distinguishing it? Like, um, is there something— is there an insight to it, to the difference between those things?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, listen, let's, uh, look into that. You said that is Samara, the unwholesome thought, or the cause of the unwholesome thought? What would be the cause of an unwholesome thought?

**Speaker C:** Delusion.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but I'm looking for something more specific. Can you Continue on that. In other words, when you say delusion, you're saying you made it up. You made that snake up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, for example, like you said, the self-view, the identity, then has this, like, is the victim of itself and of the circumstances it doesn't like, for example.

**Speaker A:** Well, Let's go to it from the perspective of the Paticcasamuppada and the Anapanasati Sutta, or the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and look at it in the sense that if it's an unwholesome thought, it's got a cause or condition, and you could say that the cause or condition for an unwholesome thought would be an unwholesome state of mind or an unwholesome feeling, or perhaps the combination of the two. That would lead back then to the investigation. If you can see this thought is unwholesome, let's chase it down a little bit. What's the attitude? What's the feeling? If you have feelings of fear, So one thought leads to another. An example of that is seeing kudzu and thinking about a snake, and then the next thought is getting bitten by the snake. Well, the snake came first, but the kudzu was there before that, and the idea then of walking in the kudzu. So there's a sequence of events that happen, and remember that these happen in the mind very fast. We're talking about from seeing kudzu to walking in kudzu to stepping on a snake to getting bitten by a snake. That's a series of 4 thoughts, each one of them taking 200 or 300 milliseconds each. And so within 2 or 3 seconds, we've gone from a beautiful green place into being bitten by a snake. Interesting.

**Speaker C:** Hmm?

**Speaker A:** And why would we have that idea? Well, if we have the idea then is that kudzu is dangerous, but in fact kudzu by itself is not dangerous, is not dangerous to, uh, uh, in, in most respects. So who made up the snake? So we can do that kind of research, we can reflect. This is something that Ajahn Samadhi was quite famous for, is reflecting or looking back about how did we get here, what was the sequence of events that happened in the past 5 seconds that got us from an okay state into an unwholesome thought. And it almost always has to do with the underlying attitude of a victim being victimized by— in this case, victimized by a snake. Does this fit what you're talking about, Timo?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you. With the idea or definition or connotation of it being death. Maybe one could also say it's death in the sense of non-existence. Thereby you have the delusion part also, but the made-up quality of it is the thing that's not there, but is there through this process of making it a problem.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that in fact the reality is that over the years here on this island, we have seen with, and in some cases dealt with, snakes in the house, and in other cases not dealt with the snake being in the house over and over again. No kudzu was ever necessary for the snake to be here. So we made that up, recognizing that much of the— in fact, that's where the Mara comes from, is stuff that we made up. We made up that snake. The Buddha made up his fear And so he, uh, uh, he said that he's not going to walk. If he was walking, uh, or if he was, let us say, standing, he's going to stand there until the fear subsides. Well, how is the fear going to subside? Is because he's looking to see, in fact, that there's no snake or ghost or devil. That it has to do with the observation. The reality is that there is no snake. It's just a thought. Dhammarato. Yes, go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker D:** I have a question on that. So, yeah, I really like that sutta where the Buddha, if he senses the fear, if he sees the fear, so he's not going to change his posture until like this fear subsides, as you put it, like he investigates, he looks, he pays attention. My question is like, you know, sometimes I feel that sort of tenseness, that sort of fear, or like in the middle of something, and I sometimes wonder, should I just like maintain that? Like if I'm in a crowd, if I'm in a busy crowd and I feel that, like I wonder, should I get away from that place first and in seclusion, or should I just, you know, you understand my question? Like.

**Speaker A:** Like, should I get— generally, when you're in a crowded environment and you become afraid, what was the source of the fear? What caused that? And also, the question would be, what is the extent of it? Is there anxiety? Did you have just the thought of a fear that was passing, or did it stay long enough to create an adrenaline drip so that now you're uptight and tense? And what can you do about that? The question would be, now it's time to start breathing so that you can dissipate that adrenaline. Or if it's in fact a dangerous situation, you can check that out. You can see exactly where the danger was coming from, in the sense of you might be walking onto a subway car and there's a pickpocket within 6 feet of you. Can you identify who that pickpocket is, is that the source of your agitation and worry? That is well known. We've known this for a long time, that when people are approached by a robber from behind, even if they're not aware of the robber approaching from behind, still the hair on the back of their neck will stand up. Because there's certain amounts of the body that knows that they're in danger. So the question is, is that can you recognize danger for its own sake? You're recognizing that, is it Mara in the sense, did you make it up, or is it part of the environment that you're in? And possibly the best way to deal with that is by getting off of that subway car, changing your route, go someplace else, find a place where you feel comfortable. Because you may not know the source of the danger, but as a Dhamma practitioner, you become aware of the danger without even knowing its source.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, um, it may be that you're in a brand new environment and the fear is, uh, based upon the past or based upon the unknown. For instance, uh, it's quite possible for someone to step on the subway, let us say the Skytrain in Bangkok, for the first time and feel fear, even though there's nothing fearful present. Or maybe the fear comes from being in a closed, tight space where there's people that are invading your territory, where in normal outside you have a distance. And so can you identify that the feeling of fear that you have is just because of the environment Or is there something in that environment that is actually dangerous? The idea then would be with that is, let's start investigating this environment. Let's look around to see who's who. Let's start looking for body language and see what's going on. If you can't get off the car, or if you can get off the car, the best thing to do is to get off the car. Get some space so that you don't continue to put up with the danger in your own mind. Because once the danger appears in reality, the Mara in your mind is going to take over. The selfishness, or in this case we could call it the self-preservation instinct, is likely to go wild, and you get all uptight and everything for no reason at all.

**Speaker C:** Exactly, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So Mr. Ben, do you have anything to say about this?

**Speaker C:** Thank you for the talk, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** More. You got something else to say?

**Speaker C:** Nothing more.

**Speaker A:** Nothing more, all right. Do you take subways in Hanoi?

**Speaker C:** No subway, they've been building it. They've done one line in about 10 years, so I think it'll be finished in about 2050 maybe.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so there's— How about buses? Do you take buses in Hanoi?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, buses are fine. I have no problem with being in any sort of space.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Anapanasati Anmol, what do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** So, I see that Samadhi is when we are clinging to something, when there is the me or the self-interest arising towards whatever is happening. And like you said, the unwholesome thoughts can come or arise when the mind state or the attitude is already unwholesome. So it's easy for the Mara to take over. It's easy for the unwholesome thought that is arising to take over.

**Speaker A:** Yes, lack of mindfulness. That in fact, that's something that is in the sutras that I forgot to mention. Thanks for reminding me. And that is the cure for Mara is Sati, mindfulness. Wisdom also is to look at what's going on, see correctly what is and what is not. Rather than dealing with fears, just like the Buddha, that the way to handle his fear is by just standing there and taking a look. But most people don't have that skill of investigation.

**Speaker E:** So when we are not looking The Mara can take over. We are not paying wise attention.

**Speaker A:** The Mara can take over. Those— in fact, you could go so far then as to say also that the Mara is actually stored in and is part of our memory base, part of our Samskara. And so something can trigger that and it can be brought up. Like for instance, being in a closed space or walking in an area where you can't see the ground, going on elevators. There's all kinds of situations that will bring up fear or anxiety even because of the old habits.

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And the right way to handle that is by investigation. Eddie Leo, do you have something to say?

**Speaker F:** Hello, Dhammarato. Do you listen me?

**Speaker C:** Yes?

**Speaker F:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** No? Yeah, I'm here, go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Ah, okay. How you say, I will know, I don't speak English very well, Dhammarato, and it's difficult for me to say, but I want to say one thing. The cure for Mara, for me, is Puja. Is right?

**Speaker A:** All right, coming back to something familiar, that if you're, um, let us say, in the habit of practicing Bu Do, Bu on the in-breath and Do on the out-breath, that is an actual excellent way of dealing with anxiety. But there we're dealing with the anxiety on the inside. And that's a really good way of dealing with it. But if you're in a dangerous environment, the Budo is not going to prevent you from being in actual danger. It's only going to be able to get you out of your own perceived danger, the Mara.

**Speaker F:** Yes, but Bhikkhu, help me. For that.

**Speaker A:** Yes?

**Speaker F:** Yes? I dealing with Mara.

**Speaker C:** With—.

**Speaker F:** Sorry, my English is not very good for expressing something. I can understand the English, but for speak is not very good for me. And, but no Mara.

**Speaker A:** In fact, if I could mention it then, you've said it twice now, which indicates that you've got some fear and trepidation about not being able to speak English. That is Mara.

**Speaker F:** Yes, but no Mara, no, for me now, no. It's a good, it's a joke.

**Speaker A:** And yet at the same time, there's no danger here. We're all patient, we'll listen to what you have to say.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you very much. For that, I don't come in because I don't speak English and it's difficult as Prime Sun Tzu, but I can listen very well and it's so good.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let me give you this example. Because I've had hearing problems— problems means I don't hear what people are saying. It's not a problem, actually. In fact, it allows me to ignore. And one of the things that I can ignore is Thai television. I don't have to listen to any of it because I wouldn't understand it anyway. So it's not a problem. Okay, so yes, think of it like that, is that your lack of English is not a problem. The problem is that you made it a problem.

**Speaker F:** Yes, I don't make any problem for that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but there really is no problem.

**Speaker F:** Yes, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. All right, so moving along, how about you, Karwan? Do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** Nothing to say about.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. Mara is not here. Mara is not here. Okay. How about you, Krishna? You have something to say?

**Speaker C:** No, I'm good.

**Speaker A:** Nick, how about you? Do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** No, no, I don't have anything to say.

**Speaker A:** Do you have any questions about what we're talking about?

**Speaker C:** No, no, I don't have any questions about Mara. No obvious ones.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** No.

**Speaker A:** So how about you, Paul? Good to be reminded to investigate if there is an actual danger or if it's just Mara.

**Speaker C:** Thank you for the talk.

**Speaker A:** So Red, what do you have to say? About the stories that we make up. I don't know if anyone can actually hear me.

**Speaker C:** Hello?

**Speaker A:** Hello? Okay.

**Speaker B:** So we basically go straight to investigation.

**Speaker A:** Skipping dissolving the Vedanas and the Mara.

**Speaker C:** That it?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Sati, to remember, and investigation. Ditti, looking. That's secure for the Mara, both internally and externally. And when there is no cure, then there is selfishness. The Mara is the self. That's an important point for everybody to remember, that when you're selfish, that's the Mara. Now there's another point to make that's very interesting, and that is that Mara is jealous, and one of the jealousies is of one who is practicing correctly. Which means that when you're a Dhamma dude, when you're practicing correctly, Mara will come in the thoughts of, oh, well, maybe I'll go do this and maybe I'll go do that. Karuna just brought up about going dancing. Okay, so if he's a Dhamma dude and he's correctly practicing, then the idea of, oh, well, let me go have some sensual entertainment. So that would be Mara talking. Now, whether he gives into the dancing or not is not the issue. The issue is, is he going to have an internal conflict about rules? Shall I go dancing and enjoy it, or am I going to in fact write a rule saying thou shalt not dance? And therefore he's going to feel bad because he broke a rule that he himself made. So jealousy, Mara, will try to get you to come out of your correct practice and go do something in, let us say, in your realm of habits, what you've been doing before your Dharma. The Mara in your mind will want you to go do that. I remember specifically one time when I was at Wat Suwan Mokkh and the thought not just came, but it plagued for gosh couple of days or more about, oh, well, I can go back to the United States and make a lot of money. Why am I sitting here in Thailand doing nothing? And then I would reflect upon, because when I was in the United States making all that money, I still wasn't happy. And now I'm thinking about going back. But then the realization hit me, you want to call it insight, is that, oh, right now the problem is not that I want to go back to America. But the problem is, because I don't— the problem is, is that I'm not practicing correctly. I'm not seeing that thought directly. And when I started to practice correctly and having joy and benefit, the idea of going back to the United States and making money didn't occur, I don't think, ever again. Because I started practicing correctly. I wasn't practicing correctly, and the reason for it was because I was letting Mara dictate that right now is not good enough. And all those became good examples you gave in some lessons before. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Those became good examples that you gave some lessons before. Okay. So, Tim, do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** Hi, Dhammarato. Yes, I thought that the word Mara and Anicca mare from nightmare could be related, and also Märchen from German, which would make sense since it's just a bad dream.

**Speaker A:** Can you explain a little bit more?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just relatedness. Mara, mare from nightmare, it's just not real. It's just a dream. So there could be a connection in the language.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm using the word dream differently than you. I would use the word— actually, the proper would be perception or storytelling. But in the low-class Dharma world that I live in, I would say you made that shit up. You're dreaming would be another way of saying that. You make it up. That's what a dream is, is something that we made up.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** So that's where the Mara is. In other words, when we say we made that shit up, we could say, and that's the Mara. And not only that, but we become that. We become that Mara. That's who we are in that moment. That means that's the self. That's the, uh, um, the arising of the self. Now I know that it's been a great discussion throughout Western Buddhism. Does the self exist? Or not. And that's actually not the right way to phrase the question because you're not going to get an answer. There's going to be a yes or no answer to that yes or no question. It is better to understand that there is no permanent self, that it's temporary. It arises and then passes away just like everything else, except that it also happens at the speed of thought. Within a second, you can tell yourself a story, and that story can be just an image, just a slight image. You can have, like I said, stepping into the kudzu, and then the thought is just a snake. Well, that snake was just an image. It didn't even last a tenth of a second. It was fleeting, but if you have those fleeting little images pop up, then that's going to lead to attachment, it's going to lead to the self-preservation mechanism, which is going to bring fear, where in fact it was just a thought, a very short-timed thought, not much there at all.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So it's not even at a full dream level. They say that dreams last about 5 seconds. Some of these dreams last not even a tenth of a second. So, Ioannis, do you have something to say?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, it's very fun to catch Mara when you see it coming. Also because it's usually the same stuff. Like for me, I wait for Mara to come when I wake up in the morning. You know, the thought of, oh, I don't want to come up, and when I see it, it's like a lot of fun because I see, hey, like, I see you, and then I can just get up without wrestling with it. Because yeah, like, Mara wants to fight every time, they like wants to wrestle. But if you, if you see Mara coming, like, you don't have to go.

**Speaker A:** And— he wants to own, wants to control.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato wants to do anything to gain control. And, and guess what? That's in our nature. It's part of our DNA. You can call it self-preservation instinct. And when it arises, it arises as Mara, and it also arises as a self. And if we're on guard, if we're mindful, if we're watching, we can say, aha, I see you, Mara. That's a very famous statement by the Buddha. It occurs often in the sutras, especially in the Samyutta Nikaya, in the group of fours of the Mara. Aha, I see you, Mara. Yeah, yeah, I think I saw that, Mikey.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I've read some analogies that they like compare the mind to a throne with like only one spot. And yeah, like throughout the day, a lot of, you know, Maras want to go and get on the throne, and you have like to watch for that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that throne indicates ownership.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Does anybody else have something to say?

**Speaker D:** I have something quick to say.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, just elaborating what Yuna said. Yuna said something really I spot something here. I realize sometimes the identification with the struggle, it's very sneaky for me. It's like I'm identified with the liking, disliking. Like, oh, I have to struggle with this because, like that kind of story. I have to fight with this, that kind of thing. And I can see like that, to me, that's my kind of Dukkha, like, yeah, to struggle with Mara basically.

**Speaker A:** Don't struggle with Mara. In fact, that's what we were talking about, that that's what Mara wants. It wants to struggle with you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wants to own Okay, and really all you need to do is see— I see you, Mara. If you could say it like that, I see you, Mara, it sneaks— it slivers off, swings away. And that said, in, in so many different suttas, that the way to get rid of Mara is by saying, I see you. Aha, I see you, Mara, is the correct way of dealing with that. That's the way that the Buddha did. Once the Buddha acknowledges the Mara and sees the Mara, the actual seeing the Mara is taking control immediately. There's no struggle, there's no fight. The struggle is when we don't see that we're struggling with Mara.

**Speaker D:** Yes, and I also want to ask, is that— I often hear this in the sutta, you know, the Citta Nimita, like the sign of the mind. Is that— I was wondering if that's Citta Nimita, like, you know, like a flash of a second, like, if I— because I don't catch it, you know, like I was not mindful enough, I didn't catch that. And then because I'm not paying attention, suddenly it becomes fear. And then that's where the struggle identity arises.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, yes, exactly. In another sutta, in fact, it's Sutta Number 65 in the ones of the Anguttara Nikaya, AN 1.65, is where the Buddha says The mind is fast, oh monks. It's so fast that the Buddha does not even have an analogy for it. Now, that may be just something to say, but if you can take that as part of your practice to recognize that Mara can slip up within a tenth of a second or less. In one tiny little mind moment, just a flash of an image will come by. And if we can see those flashes, we can say, "Aha! I saw that. I saw that little flash. I don't even have to go all the way into the fear of the snake because I saw the image of the snake," recognizing that it was only a mental aberration. As Red said, it's just a dream, a very fast dream. So Ivan, you've heard me say this before: wakey wakey, pay attention, watch these little things as they pop up because they pop up really fast. It's almost like a spark. Yeah, it's just a spark, but if you're not aware of that spark, then it can set something on fire.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So does anybody else have something to say?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I have a question. So like, what will be the difference between Avisya and Mara in this sense? Because I've also heard Avisya being described in this way, you know, like the magician in your mind that plays tricks on you. Avisya.

**Speaker A:** In the way that we're talking about it, it's the same thing.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Just two different words for it. Anicca means not knowing, ignorance. So, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker C:** Happily.

**Speaker B:** See you, Mara. All right, friends, thanks for being here today. So nice to see so many kind and worth-knowing Dharma friends here.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a group of Sangha friends, focuses on demystifying the Buddhist concept of **Mara**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Mara as an Internal, Psychological Phenomenon**
*   **Mara is not an external devil.** The talk clarifies that Mara, often personified in stories, is not an evil cosmic being like Satan. It is a **metaphor for internal, unwholesome mental states**.
*   **Mara means "death"** and is linked to fear, clinging, selfishness, and the arising of the sense of "I" or self. When the "self" is born, Mara is born.
*   **Mara is the unwholesome thought itself and its cause.** It arises from conditions like delusion, past habits (saṅkhāras), and a mind already in an unwholesome state (e.g., fearful or selfish).

### **Key Illustrations and Examples**
1.  **The Kudzu & Snake:** The fear of a snake in the kudzu vines is a classic example. The snake is a mental fabrication (Mara), not a present reality. The fear comes from the thought, not the environment.
2.  **The Buddha's Encounters:** Even after enlightenment, the Buddha was visited by Mara (as shown in the Saṃyutta Nikāya). His mastery was in **immediately recognizing** ("Aha! I see you, Mara!") and dispelling these mental states through investigation, not struggle.
3.  **Everyday Life:** Mara appears as the voice of distraction from practice (e.g., "go dancing instead"), the fear in a crowded place, the anxiety about not speaking English well, or the morning thought "I don't want to get up."

### **The Practice: How to Deal with Mara**
*   **The Antidote is Mindfulness (Sati) and Investigation.** The crucial skill is to catch the spark of an unwholesome thought as it arises with lightning speed.
*   **Don't Struggle.** Mara thrives on conflict. The Buddha's method was simple recognition—seeing Mara clearly robs it of power.
*   **Investigate the Sequence.** Trace back the chain of thoughts (e.g., see kudzu → think "snake" → think "bite" → feel fear) to see the fabricated nature of the fear.
*   **Distinguish Real Danger from Mental Fabrication.** Check if fear is based on a real, present threat (requiring practical action) or a mental story (requiring mindful investigation).

### **Community Insights (Q&A Highlights)**
*   The discussion reinforced that Mara is the **clinging self**, and its "jealousy" manifests as distractions from diligent practice.
*   Mara can be related to **"nightmares" or "Märchen" (fairy tales)**—emphasizing its nature as a made-up story.
*   The mind is incredibly fast; Mara can arise in a flash. Practice involves becoming alert enough to see these "sparks" before they ignite suffering.
*   **Avijjā (ignorance)** and **Māyā (illusion)** are closely related concepts—all pointing to the deluded, story-making function of the mind.

### **Conclusion**
The talk concludes by emphasizing that the path is about **awakening to Mara's game within our own minds**. The Sangha (spiritual community) serves as a vital support system for this practice, helping each other to "see Mara" through wise friendship and shared Dhamma discussion.

**In essence:** Mara is the personification of our own inner hindrances, fear, and selfishness. Freedom comes not from fighting a devil, but from mindful, investigative awareness that sees these mental patterns clearly for what they are: fleeting, fabricated, and empty of a permanent self.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several key **metaphors and stories** to explain the Buddhist concept of **Mara**:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Devil/Angel on the Shoulder:** Mara is compared to the common Western cartoon image of a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other. This metaphor is used to shift the understanding of Mara from an external, evil being to an **internal voice or tendency** within one's own mind.

2.  **Kudzu and the Imagined Snake:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Kudzu:** Represents a neutral or even beneficial situation (in Japan, kudzu is a useful plant; in the U.S., it's an invasive one because of context).
    *   **The Snake:** Represents **Mara**—specifically, the **fearful, unwholesome thought** that arises without an actual external threat. The farmer's fear of stepping on a snake in the kudzu is a creation of the mind, not a present reality. This perfectly illustrates Mara as a psychological phenomenon—a "made-up" problem that generates suffering.

3.  **The Throne:** The mind is compared to a throne, and various "Mara"s (unwholesome thoughts, impulses) try to sit on it and take control throughout the day. The practice of mindfulness is likened to being a vigilant guard who sees these claimants and prevents them from taking the seat of ownership/control.

4.  **Sparks and Fire:** Unwholesome thoughts (Mara) are like tiny, fast **sparks**. If you are not mindful and don't see the spark immediately, it can ignite a full-blown "fire" of fear, anxiety, or suffering.

5.  **War to Stop War:** The "war" with Mara is described as a war to **stop the war**—an internal conflict aimed at ending internal (and thereby external) harm. It's not an apocalyptic battle but a present-moment psychological one.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha and Mara in the Suttas:**
    *   **Before Enlightenment:** Stories are referenced where the Buddha (as a Bodhisattva) dealt with Mara, such as in the Upaya Sutta (Sutta 4), where he confronted fearful thoughts. This shows that Mara is a universal challenge, even for the Buddha-to-be.
    *   **After Enlightenment:** Crucially, the speaker references the **Mara Samyutta** (Sutta collection #4 in the Samyutta Nikaya), where Mara continues to visit the Buddha *after* his enlightenment. The key difference is that the enlightened Buddha **immediately recognizes** Mara ("Aha! I see you, Mara."), demonstrating that the goal is not to never have unwholesome thoughts, but to be so alert that you see their arising instantly and they lose their power.

2.  **Flip Wilson's "The Devil Made Me Do It":** The 1960s comedian's catchphrase is used as a cultural story to point out a deep truth. The humor lies in blaming an external devil, but the Buddhist insight is that **"the devil" (Mara) is the self**—the birth of selfishness and self-clinging. The speaker reframes it: "The devil made me buy that dress" becomes "**I** *am* the devil when that impulse arises."

3.  **Personal Anecdote from Wat Suwan Mokkh:** The speaker shares a story from his time in a monastery where the thought (Mara) persistently arose: "I could go back to America and make money instead of being here." He realized this was Mara's "jealousy" of correct practice, trying to pull him back to old habits. The **cure was not fighting the thought**, but returning to correct practice, which caused the tempting thought to fade away.

4.  **The Asian Carp Story:** This brief anecdote parallels the kudzu story. The Asian carp was an invasive "problem" in U.S. rivers until people reframed it as a resource (food for export). This illustrates how a shift in perception and approach—seeing clearly instead of reacting with aversion—can "solve" a problem, much like mindfulness solves the "problem" of Mara.

### **Core Conceptual Linkages**
The metaphors and stories consistently link Mara to:
*   **The Self/Selfishness:** "The birth of the self is actually the birth of Mara."
*   **Fear & Death:** Mara is linked to the fear of death and non-existence.
*   **Unwholesome Thoughts:** Any unwholesome, deluded, or fear-based thought is an instance of Mara.
*   **Clinging:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's view is cited: clinging itself is Mara.
*   **The Cure - Mindfulness (Sati):** The repeated solution is **awareness and investigation**—"I see you, Mara." This immediate recognition is portrayed as a disarming act, not a struggle.
