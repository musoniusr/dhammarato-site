### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, well, Martin, I'm glad that you are asking this so that we can clean up some of the misunderstandings about it.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, sorry.

**Speaker A:** All right, I will. That should do it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's perfect. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you were asking questions about bringing all of the factors together for the first Jhana. All right. Now, the Sukkha is the first thing that we do, but in the sutta, it has it in the order of Piti, Sukkha, but in practice it's going to be Sukkha, Piti, more Piti, a whole lot of Piti, then back to Sukkha. Okay, that's the sequence of timing events. And the part when I says a whole lot of Sukkha is the second Jhana, and then back to— excuse me, a whole lot of Piti is the second Jhana, and then the third Jhana is back to the Sukkha. Again. Okay, it's like, um, there's too much joy, it becomes too intense, and there's no reason to have it so full-on intense. But we have to be able to manage it. Okay, we have to be able to manage our feelings. Just like we can get into a very, very funky bad state down at the very bottom, we can get into depression, we can get suicidal, we can go right to the bottom. Of being out of control. So the question is, is can we go right to the top in control? Okay. And that there is a resting place after that, which would be very easygoing. But the Piti itself is intense. Okay, so Sukkha would be, this is nice. Piti would be, wow, this is nice. And then even a higher piti than that is voiceless. It's like, okay, okay. So the question is, well, how do we create or generate or manifest this piti? And then how does it get bigger? Well, the way that we learn to manufacture it or create it in the first place is through the feeling successful at the Sukkha. Let me explain that. So, the practice of Anapanasati then is to come out of unwholesome states of mind and into wholesome states of mind, and in the process, we talk ourselves into happy thoughts, gladdening, brightening the mind kind of thoughts that also tend to be wholesome thoughts. So by giving ourselves wholesome thoughts, we wind up feeling in that wholesome way, which would basically be feeling safe and secure and satisfied. And we continue with that: safe, secure, and satisfied. Safe, secure, and satisfied. And let that be the resting point of Sukkha. All right, that's the resting point. And it needs 3 items of the Eightfold Noble Path to do this. One of the 3 is to remember to wake up, to take a look, and to make a change. So if we wake up and take a look and see some fear, we change that to becoming unafraid, feeling safe instead. Now, feeling safe is what we're looking for, not the feeling of fearlessness. Fearlessness is something else in our language. What is fearlessness? The guy who's ready to go into battle all dressed up and he's ready to go. The gung-ho spirit of the Marine is a fearless spirit. We're not looking for fearlessness because we're not going into battle. There's no battle. There is nothing to fear. That's a completely different state. Yes. Yeah, there is no danger. There is no fear. And the recognition of that is not fearlessness. It's the feeling of safety. Okay. All right. So this is an important thing because we actually begin to feel safe and secure, not gung-ho, ready for battle. Because the battle indicates that there's a problem that needs to be solved and we're going to solve it by having a battle. But the safety is because there is no problems. Now this is an important place about the Sukkha, is that it is satisfying, it is good enough, it's just enough. Now, when we practice this over and over and over again, these three things running in circle around each other—Sati, Ditti, and Viriya—which is: remember to wake up to take a look, and to change. When we work with these three things over and over and over again so that we do feel that Sukkha and we do feel satisfied, something else happens. And that is, we begin to get the idea we can do this. We can do it. So we're adding a new ingredient not success itself, but successful. There's a distinction between satisfying or satisfactory and success. And we're adding the success to the satisfaction. Why? Because we're actually successful at being satisfied. This is where the wow comes from. The satisfaction is, yeah, that's good. But the Piti comes in as, wow, that's good. Yeah, we can do that. Okay, this is the quality of Piti. It's translated into the word rapture, but I have not ever seen the word rapture used this way. Maybe it was 100 and whatever years ago, 140 years ago when they first started using that word rapture. Maybe back then it did mean that wow feeling and has the quality of bliss. Well, the bliss is actually after the pity melts away. Okay, here's an example of that is that people climb Mount Everest on a regular basis. It's a common thing to do. It's a challenge. Okay, so one of the things that they know for sure now is that you can't just climb to the top of the mountain. Even taking a helicopter ride up there is not going to do it because it's too high. It's at 29,000 feet, and helicopters are only good to about 15,000 feet. So don't expect a helicopter to take you there, right? So what they do is they go up and establish a base station. It's very, very high up on the side of the mountain. Remember that quality of the base station, because they're going to get to the base station, get all their gear to the base station, get acclimated to the thin air and the climate on the mountain. And then after they've got the base station completely ready, now they're ready to make that final journey to the top of the mountain.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That top of the mountain is the Piti. It's the apex of how good we can feel.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And the base level is the Sukkha. We rise up.

**Speaker A:** Rise up, and then we got the— and then the Piti is on top of that. Exactly right. The base station is the Sukkha, and then the final mount is to go up to the top of the mountain Take a look around. But guess what? Nobody stays on the very pinnacle top of Mount Everest, or in fact any other mountain. That's a very— the winds are heavy up there. It's cold, right? But we've made it. That's that exhilaration. I made it to the top of the world. And then we come back down to the base station. Okay. Okay. This is the way. That we want to practice our Anapanasati is with the idea that we're going to get a very, very good, solid, 100% top quality base station. Okay, that's the Sukkha. Over and over and over and over again, we practice just being satisfied. This is good enough. I can manage. I'm on top of the world now. All right, and then it will come, wow, I actually am on top of the world! Wow, I did make it! Wow, I cannot believe how successful I am! That, it shoots chills up the spine to know that you've made it, you got it. Okay, that's the Piti. But you're not going to stay in that, uh, excited energized, skin-crawling, goosebumps, exhilarating state for just a little while. Okay, but it can't— the Sukkha can't— excuse me, the Piti can get so intense that you can't even talk about it anymore. Oh, okay. This is, this is why it is associated with the second Jhana, is because the second Jhana is when the thoughts stop? Well, always thoughts will stop when we become curious and interested in something. For instance, you see somebody walking down the street and you stop thinking whatever you were thinking about and look. Well, that looking time took a mind moment. It was a kind of thought, except that the thought that you were having was looking at somebody. And then the next thought will be probably telling yourself a story about what you just saw. That's verbal. But for a little while, it was totally experiential. We were just looking at what we were looking at without talking to ourselves about it. Okay, so Piti can get so intense that you can't even talk about it anymore. It's just wow.

**Speaker B:** So in fact, you don't train the Piti, you train the Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** The Piti is indirect.

**Speaker A:** The Piti will come later after the Sukkha is well trained.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, after you get your base station well done, then we will have thoughts something like, I can do this. This is great. I'm on top of the world. Those are the kind of thoughts then that will make the Piti into the Sukkha. Okay, sort of like at the base station and 5 guys are at the base station, been there for a week. They're all pumped up and ready to go. And then the weather clears and the guy in charge of the expedition says, okay guys, is ready to go. And they're ready to go. They're going to charge right up to the top of that mountain, right? That's what it's— so this is the point, is that you'll get to that, that in the sense of your attitude, because over a long period of time of, let's say, climbing up and establishing the base station took a whole lot of correct practice, giving results. And the results then are safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And we keep practicing that over and over again until we begin to get the idea, well, I can actually do this. I can feel safe, secure, and satisfied over and over and over again. I can do it. I can do it next time. I can do it the time after that. I can do it when the boss is here. I can do it when the cops are here. I can do it. OK, that attitude of I can do it then is what builds the Piti, that wow feeling that has to do with success. This is exactly what happens in the sports like the Olympics when the guy who is running the 100-yard dash, when he is at the end of that run and he knows that he's winning, he will start showing the results of his knowledge of knowing that he's winning. He doesn't have to turn around and look because he knows those guys are behind him. They're not right up and they're not ahead of him. He's first and he knows it. OK, and so he gets that winner's attitude that in fact, with that, you see the runners are running and running and running and running and running and running. And then they have this piece of cloth called the goal line. OK. The question is, what touches that goal line? What hits that goal line? Is it his fist, because he's running like that? Or has he already got it out so he's ready for that chest out? I've won. OK, that's what we're getting at, is that at the end of the race, here we are in the race with all of that Piti, or excuse me, all of that Sukkha and all of that Sukkha getting it going and getting satisfied. But right at the end of the race, the knowledge of I've done it, okay, the knowledge that I've got it, the knowledge I have won this contest. We don't have the gold medal in the hand yet, and in fact, that's just a ceremony. Getting the gold medal is irrelevant. Winning the race is the issue, okay? Doing it, getting it done, that's the Piti. That's that wow, that's that exhilaration, that's being on top of the world, which is kind of a little bit different than the bliss that you feel after the Piti has subsided back into a different kind of Sukkha that is relaxed. Now it's fully relaxed. And that would be the Piti of the first— excuse me, the Sukkha of the third jhana is after the second jhana, after we felt as good as we can. Now we relax into the third jhana, and when we go even deeper into relaxation, below that would be what's called Upekkha.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's equanimity.

**Speaker A:** Equanimity, that you're completely finished. You have won that race. You have been to Mount Everest. You don't even need to go back because you were really there. So climbing the mountain and getting to base station is the practice until we get to the Sukkha. And then we keep practicing getting ready to go to the top. Once we get up to the top, that's the Piti. Coming back to the base station is the Sukkha. But then when we go back down to the bottom of the mountain, now we're not going as an adventurer. We're going as a Grand Master, so we go back into the state of relaxation completely. This is the Upekkha. This Upekkha is strong. This Upekkha is good stuff. This Upekkha is kind of like having your sea legs. The Upekkha would have the statement, "I can handle anything," except we don't even have to say it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is where we're looking for the Piti, is to completion of the first Jhana. So it's not going to have the intensity of the second Jhana because the intensity of the second Jhana Piti is voiceless, it's wordless, it's I couldn't say anything about it. I'm having too much fun in the Piti to remind myself that I'm in Piti. I don't need the reminding. I don't need to talk myself into it anymore because I'm there, I'm arrived.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So it's not— oh, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So sometimes you can go to the second Jhana because the Piti is like all over the top, but sometimes you can't. Because it's not like that. It's not something you choose.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Well, there are some things that you can do that will aid that.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** With— by being in the state of Sukkha and having your thoughts, very wholesome thoughts of, wow, this is nice. Wow, I can do this. And pretty soon it becomes a wow, I can do this. Because you get it. But we start with the words. So they— so just like you talked yourself into feeling good with the Sukkha, you can also talk yourself into, wow, how nice things are. Wow, this is a paradise. Wow, we are okay. All of the top stuff, that's the Piti, which is the expression of overwhelming joy. It has that quality of being overwhelming in the sense that once it comes, it's like a wave, it's knocking you down with great joy. So that's the Piti, but it can be developed. It's a skill, it says so in the Anapanasati Sutta, that Piti is a skill to be developed. Just like Sukkha is a skill to be developed. But we need to develop different skills because there's two different skills between building a base station and getting it fit and getting acclimated and making it to the top. Different skill. You cannot make it to the top without already having the skills of getting to the base station. But that final ascent is going to take a new skill. Okay, it's going to really take an 'I can do this' attitude. One step at a time, I can make it. One step at a time, I can make it. I can climb that mountain. I've got it. Okay. And it has everything to do with building confidence. The Pali word is Saddha, and that it is part of the Eightfold Noble Path under the label of Samma Sanghappa. Which is translated sometimes as the word thought, which is wrong, but many times it's translated as intention. And that's what we're looking for. The intention of being on top of the world is what takes you to the top of the world. It's our attitude, the attitude, I can do it. Okay, that and the attitude or the— this intention is very quick. But we can change that through success, and we get success by being satisfied. That's the success. So satisfaction, success, and then eventually the last item on the list, which is very much like Upekkha, except that we can use the word wealthy.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** So, well, imagine then that we have a bucket that we're filling with water. The bucket is dry. We start off with a dry bucket and we start dropping water in it. And pretty soon we begin to get some water in it. By the time that the bucket is half full, we get pretty satisfied. Hey, we've gotten something going here. When the bucket is still only a quarter full, we're not ready satisfied. But when we can get it half full, then we say, yeah, we're getting someplace, I can do this. Okay. And then we continue to fill and now we're going towards the rim, which would be the Piti.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But after we get the Piti, once we fill up the bucket completely, now it begins to overflow so that there's no water we can put into the bucket. But that water that overflows is now the wealthiness. I've got— so just with money as an example, I've got so much money that I'll give anybody who wants some, some money. Is it— I've got so much joy. I've got so much joy that anybody who wants some can have it. I've got plenty of it to spread around, right? That's the wealthy part. Okay, is that you're overflowing with wealth, overflowing with joy, overflowing with that basic point of, wow, I've got it made. Okay, now here's the thing. Somebody can actually have that attitude with money, but almost never does it happen. And the reason for it is, is because people want money, they get some money, they feel good a little bit, and then they don't feel good anymore. And so they want more money, thinking that money is going to make them feel good. And they get more money and more money and more money. Sometimes they steal, sometimes it's a windfall, sometimes it's good work, but whatever, they keep getting more and more money. But the money itself is never enough. And so they feel like tightwads. It's very rarely when somebody, even the richest man in the world, still wants more money. But it takes a change. And let me give you two people as an example. Bill Gates is a new example of a philanthropist. He's wealthy because he's got enough money to donate. He has given huge amounts of money to COVID. He's given huge amounts of money for AIDS and other illnesses. And he's got doctors and all of that in Africa. And he puts out millions of dollars every year. Why does he do that? Because he thinks he's got enough already. Now, the other example is Elon Musk. Elon Musk, from time to time, has actually been the richest man in the world, but he is still intent on doing what he wants to do, and he's not intent on helping anybody. He's got his sort of egoistic greed, and he says, "Oh, I want to help the whole planet by giving them electric cars." But that's not the point. The point is that he's not old enough and retired enough to actually feel that wealth. He'll use the money to build a new factory, but he is not wealthy enough to just give money to whatever project he thinks needs it. He's only interested in giving money to his projects. Therefore, he is not wealthy. But Bill Gates is learning. Now, here's something that we can see, is that over time, there have been many, many, many tycoons, some of whom die without doing much of anything, and others become major philanthropists. For example, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation—those guys got old enough with so much money, they started doing things with it for other people, building universities. The Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation do many, many good things. And so this is the example then of what it's like when you do feel completely wealthy. But most people, no matter how rich they get, they still never feel wealthy. They always want more and more and more and more. So what we're doing here is we're actually practicing going in that direction of the feeling of being really wealthy by becoming satisfied with the money that we've got. And then we make a whole lot of money, a whole pile of good feeling money. Now we begin to give it away. From wealth. OK, so this is the other thing: the Westerners get the idea that all that Piti is, oh, it's a goal, it's got to be way, way off in the distance and hard to get. No, because you've been that way. I mean, when you got a birthday gift when you were a child, you felt that exuberant overflowing of joy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we do that when we're kids, but then we're trained out of it and we don't allow ourselves to feel that good anymore. So that's one of the reasons I ask students the question of, well, how good can you feel? Because this is the invitation to get out of your base station and go to the top. You don't have to stay there, but go see what it's like. Go figure out that you are in control of your life enough that you can feel any way you want to feel, including that wow, on top of the world experience. Because then you'll come off with that experience of that wow, spending a few minutes in the Piti, coming back with the actual knowledge that yes, I can do this. I can get myself into that kind of state. And then it comes back down to kind of nothing much at all, because we're just in the senses now. Okay, so we can talk about that a little bit more at a later time, but the point is that it's kind of got a sequence of events, and eventually, once the wealth situation is done, we begin to see even that too is empty, and so ultimately the only thing that's left is nothing much at all, which is again this Upekkha. But it's got solid, solid confidence underlying that nothing. All right.

**Speaker B:** I wanted just to ask you, can you have Upekkha without the rest, because when my cat died, it was a very long night, it was 12 hours, you know, he was dying, and at first I was very, I was panicking, you know, I had a lot of fear, and then it dropped, and I was just doing what I need to do, being with him, taking care and the fear disappears. And it looks like.

**Speaker A:** Upekkha. Yes, when we just accept what's going on, then in fact, Arahant Anicca has a little story about that which may fit exactly with what we're talking about in the sense of Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha. So let us apply it to a doctor. A doctor, actually many doctors, a lot of doctors don't want to even practice medicine once they find out what it is. But those doctors who want to help people, that's the Metta.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But normally the doctor will catch whatever illness the patient has unless he's careful. That carefulness to not get sick the way that the patient has gotten sick You know, that was a big deal in COVID, that the nurses were getting COVID left, right, and center because they didn't know how to handle people with COVID Now that they know how to handle it, nurses don't get sick with the COVID anymore. OK, so that's the point about Karuna, is that you have to deal with people who are sick. Don't get sick with them. When somebody wants to fight and argue with you, don't fight and argue with them. Okay, okay. So Mudita now is sympathetic joy in the sense of instead of arguing with them, you give them joy as long as you've got joy. So this is where the doctor then would come in with an excellent bedside manner that many doctors are actually capable of talking their patients out of actually being sick. This was an old skill. Nowadays, the doctors don't have that skill very much because they can just give somebody a pill. But we can call this— in fact, you probably heard of the statement called bedside manner.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The bedside manner means how does the doctor work with his patient when they're in the bed and he's at the bedside with them? He's standing there at the bed with them. And some doctors make their patients even more sick. And some doctors know how to talk the person out of being sick. OK, this is actually called the placebo effect. And doctors who are good at this can actually talk their patients out of— like the doctor who comes jolly into the room and looking like he's reading his chart and he says, wow, this is looking pretty good. And then he goes and he talks to the patient, but he's already got the patient. So he walks in in a good mood saying that everything is going to be fine, as opposed to the doctors walking in maybe with his own problems, grumpy or whatever. And he can tell the patient, you're going to be OK. And the patient doesn't believe it because the doctor is grumpy. Right. So this is Mudita. This is bedside manner. This is very important for Dhamma dudes to practice. Is to be able to be cheerful and on top of their game, to be up for the other people, so that you can help them this way. And now the Upekkha, in this example of the doctor, is that the doctor, no matter how good a doctor he is, no matter how his bedside manner, he's going to lose people are going to die. Okay, then in fact all of his patients are going to die. Well, that's pretty disheartening for a doctor, you know, to— you know, he's worked with this guy, maybe he's made acquaintance and friends with him, and then the old lady dies. Can the doctor handle that? If he can't, we call it burnout. And if he can handle it happily, we call it Upekkha. Okay, right. If we can handle the problems of the world, so what? The old lady died. I'm still a good doctor. People die. It's not my fault that she died. That's just the human condition. Everything that's born is going to die. But some doctors, they don't like it. They have the idea, oh, I'm a good doctor, and then somebody dies on them. They'll say, wait a minute, that person shouldn't have died, I should have been able to take care of him. If he has that attitude, he's going to burn out and quit being a doctor. The doctor has to maintain that happy, smiling attitude even in the face of death. That's Upekkha.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Another example that I have of Upekkha is imagine that you're on a large— or that we have here in this example a very large fishing boat, and on this fishing boat is the captain who had been a captain of this big fishing boat for years and years. And for some research reason or whatever, a college professor comes on board to go out to sea with him so he can do some research. The college professor has never been on this kind of a boat. He may have been on a rowboat, he may have been on a cruise liner, but this boat is in between there. And when the seas get rough, the canoe is just going to sink. But when this kind of boat, when the seas get rough, the boat's up and down like this. So the professor and the captain are sitting on the bow. And the captain says, oh, I've got to go back to the stern. Come back with me. So the captain who knows how to manage this boat and manage the waves, he can make it from the front of the boat to the back of the boat because he's got his sea legs and he knows how to handle and move and whatnot like that. This landlubber don't see— I was in the Navy, so I know all about this. The new seaman gets sick. The old salts, they love it when the newbies, what they call the landlubbers, because that old professor who's on that boat, he's not going to make it to the back. He's going to ram into the wall. He's going to grab hold of these ropes. He's going to do that because his legs are not steady. He can't handle the fact that the floor is going up and down like this. We call it the deck, but we can think of it as a floor. So, in that regard, he may actually get sick and heave over the side; if he's really unlucky, he'll go over the side, because he doesn't have his sea legs. So, in this regard, the captain has Upekkha, because he can handle that boat being tossed around. The college professor can't; he's got no Upekkha. And he's unhappy about it too. You can believe me, he's unhappy when you start running into every object that's around you. There's the wall. Yeah, right into the wall. There's the side, over the side. All right, so this is another example of Upekkha. Is that when you have sea legs, or when you can handle things, when the doctor can handle his patients dying on him, when you can be happy with someone who's arguing with you and you're not arguing, it does not mean that you're going to stop arguing. They want to argue. Can you handle that? If you can't and get into an argument, now we're the the college professor that is bashing into all the items in this conversation. But if we have Upekkha, then we can handle that guy and smile at him, not get into the argument, just say, "Yeah, you're right," and that's all there is to it. We don't have to make our point. We can handle the vicissitudes, the ups and downs. Another expression is the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. See it coming and don't get hit. That's Upekkha. Stand out of the way, dodge. That's Upekkha. And it's very handy, keeps you out of a lot of trouble. But it's the place beyond Sukkha. Why? Because the Opekkha is absolutely solid, to where the Sukkha is something that is new and we're just developing it. It's a skill that we're developing, to where Opekkha is a full-blown skill set that's completely done.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Like, it took a while for that seaman, that captain, to learn to earn his sea legs. He had to practice. He had to fall on his face sometimes, but he got up and he can steady himself, and then he went on. That's the way that we have to practice also. So there's a good— there's several good points about this analogy of the sea legs. So the Piti though, is very much like a very high point. And then people like that Piti, they will in fact get attached to it, and when it's no longer there, where's their Upekkha? You should be able to substitute the Piti with the Upekkha, in the sense of, "Wow, I feel so great!" Well, I feel okay now, everything is good, everything is fine, I don't have to be up on that pinnacle. So that's also the relationship with them. And so here's the point again: from bad feelings into the beginning of Sukkha, into getting Sukkha and getting Sukkha and getting Sukkha and getting that base station, taking it up to the top, getting the Piti, then coming back down to the base station, get everything good, and then go back to the valley happily with wholesome life, rather than the unwholesome life that we started on. Because to start with, everybody's a victim, everybody's a loser. Oh, I wish I could climb that mountain. But the guy who's actually climbed the mountain, when he comes back down, he says, wow, I did that. I'm the champion here. I'm my own life's boss. And so our whole attitude has changed, even though one was in the valley, one was on the mountaintop, and now he's back into the valley. But now he's got a completely different attitude. He's got the attitude, I can handle anything.

**Speaker B:** When there, then that.

**Speaker A:** So maybe this will help you to figure out how we're going to actually practice this stuff, because they are skills that have to be practiced, manipulated. Through thoughts, feelings, etc., like that. So the first thing to do is to get yourself into a really good feeling state, feeling satisfied. This is good enough. I may not be on top of the world, but this is good enough. And then we build on that with, wow, I can do it. I can feel good enough. And that's when we start making that ascent. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. One more pedal, one more step, I can make it to the top. I've got all the basics that I need. We got that base station done. We're right up there. One more step, one more step, and we're on top of the world. But we're not going to stay there for long. We're not even going to spend the night there because it gets cold at night on top of the world. And so we come back down to the base station. But we come back to the base station, see, in the first place, getting acclimated to the base station, we were getting ready for a journey. Now we're coming back to the base station being completely winners. We've won, we've got it, let's rest. And so they rest at the base station, and then later they come back down to the Upekkha. Are the everything is good. Now this is just an analogy, and every little thing about the analogy doesn't fit the actual practice, but this is a good idea about how the practice goes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. So all you have to do is just start with, wow, this is good. Wow, this is really good. Well, I really enjoy just watching, and I don't have to think about it. I got no problems, no worries. And that's getting yourself into that base station. Okay, then, then the thoughts, wow, this is really good, is that climb up to the top. Okay, how good can you feel? Ask yourself that. Look at it from that perspective of, wow, I can feel any way I want to, including going to the top of the world. Being successful at it. So Martin, enjoy your practice.

**Speaker B:** You're a winner.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you later. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B, likely Martin):

### **Core Topic:** The progression of meditative joy (*Piti*) and happiness (*Sukkha*) through the first three *jhānas* (meditative absorptions), and how to cultivate them in practice.

### **Key Teachings:**

1.  **Practical Sequence vs. Sutta Order:** While the suttas list the factors as *Piti* (joy/rapture) then *Sukkha* (happiness/bliss), the **practical sequence** in meditation is:
    *   First, establish **Sukkha** (a calm, satisfied happiness).
    *   From that foundation, **Piti** (intense, exhilarating joy) arises.
    *   When *Piti* becomes overwhelming and wordless, that is the **second jhāna**.
    *   As that intense joy subsides, one returns to a deeper, more relaxed **Sukkha**—this is the **third jhāna**.

2.  **The Mountain-Climbing Analogy:**
    *   **The Valley:** Starting point of ordinary, often unwholesome states.
    *   **Base Camp (Sukkha):** The first achievement. It's a state of feeling **safe, secure, and satisfied**. This is built through continuous practice: using mindfulness (*Sati*), right view (*Ditthi*), and effort (*Viriya*) to replace unwholesome thoughts (like fear) with wholesome ones.
    *   **The Summit (Piti):** The exhilarating "peak" experience. It arises from the **confidence of success**—the "wow, I can do this!" feeling born from repeatedly achieving the base camp of Sukkha. You don't stay here long.
    *   **Returning as a Master (Upekkha):** After the climb, you return to daily life (the valley) with **equanimity (*Upekkha*)**. This is a solid, unshakable confidence—like a ship captain with "sea legs"—where you can handle anything without being knocked off balance.

3.  **How to Cultivate It:**
    *   **You train Sukkha, not Piti directly.** *Piti* is an indirect result of a well-established *Sukkha*.
    *   The method is **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing): using the breath to move from unwholesome to wholesome mental states.
    *   Verbally encourage wholesome thoughts: "This is good enough," "I am safe," leading to "Wow, I can do this!" and "I am successful."
    *   The key ingredient for *Piti* is **Saddhā**—confidence or faith in the practice—which is part of Right Intention (*Sammā Saṅkappa*).

4.  **The "Wealth" of Joy:** Dhammarato uses an analogy of filling a bucket:
    *   Satisfaction fills the bucket.
    *   Success (the confidence of being able to generate satisfaction) fills it to the brim, creating *Piti*.
    *   When it overflows, that is the "wealth" of joy—a state of abundant happiness you can afford to share, akin to a philanthropist (like Bill Gates) rather than a greedy accumulator (like a younger Elon Musk in the example).

5.  **The Role of Upekkha (Equanimity):**
    *   This is the final, stable state beyond the peaks and valleys of joy.
    *   It's the ability to remain steady and compassionate amidst life's "slings and arrows," like a good doctor who maintains compassion without burning out when patients die, or someone who can remain peaceful in an argument.
    *   It is a **full-blown skill** developed through the entire journey.

### **Conclusion for the Practitioner:**
Start by cultivating a simple, satisfied happiness (*Sukkha*)—the "base camp." From that foundation of safety and satisfaction, the exhilarating joy (*Piti*) will naturally arise as a celebration of your success. Don't cling to the peak; instead, integrate the experience to develop an unshakable, steady equanimity (*Upekkha*) in all life's circumstances. The entire path is a set of **trainable skills** built through intentional thought and attitude.

### Metaphors and Stories

The talk uses several extended metaphors and illustrative stories to explain the progression of meditative states (Jhanas) and related mental qualities. Here are the main ones:

### **1. The Mountain Climbing Metaphor (for Jhana progression)**
This is the central, most detailed metaphor.
*   **Base Station = Sukkha (pleasure/joy):** The foundational state of feeling safe, secure, and satisfied. It must be well-established through repeated practice, like acclimatizing and setting up a base camp on a mountain.
*   **Final Ascent to the Summit = Piti (rapture/ecstasy):** The exhilarating, intense peak experience. It's like the challenging climb from base camp to the summit of Mount Everest.
*   **The Summit Itself = Peak of Piti (2nd Jhana):** The brief, wordless, overwhelming pinnacle of joy. No one stays there long (it's windy and cold), but the achievement is transformative.
*   **Return to Base Station = Sukkha again (3rd Jhana):** Coming back down to a deeper, more relaxed, and confident pleasure after the peak experience.
*   **Return to the Valley = Upekkha (equanimity):** Going back to ordinary life not as a novice, but as a "Grand Master" with unshakable "sea legs." The attitude shifts from "I wish I could climb that mountain" to "I can handle anything."

### **2. The Olympic Sprinter Story (for the moment of Piti)**
*   The runner who **knows** he's winning the 100-meter dash **before** he even crosses the line embodies **Piti**. It's not the medal (the external reward); it's the internal, exhilarating **knowledge of success itself**—the "I've won!" feeling that changes his posture and expression. This illustrates how Piti arises from the confidence of achievement.

### **3. The Bucket of Water Metaphor (for the accumulation of wholesome states)**
*   The mind is like a **dry bucket**. Practice (wholesome thoughts) is like adding **water**.
    *   **Half-full = Satisfaction (Sukkha):** "We're getting somewhere."
    *   **Full to the rim = Piti:** The peak, ecstatic state.
    *   **Overflowing = Wealthiness/Upekkha:** Having so much joy and stability that it naturally overflows and can be shared with others. This leads into the next story.

### **4. The Story of Wealthy Philanthropists vs. Greedy Tycoons (for Upekkha as "wealth")**
*   This contrasts two types of "wealth":
    *   **Elon Musk-type:** Immensely rich but always seeking more for his own projects, representing someone who accumulates pleasant feelings but never feels truly "wealthy" or satisfied.
    *   **Bill Gates-type (or Rockefeller/Carnegie):** A philanthropist who, having attained enough, gives generously. This represents **Upekkha**—the state of being so "wealthy" in inner peace and joy that one is unperturbed and can give freely. True wealth is the feeling of "having enough."

### **5. The Doctor's Bedside Manner Story (for the Brahma Viharas and Upekkha)**
*   Used to explain the four "sublime abodes" (Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha) in a professional context:
    *   **Metta (Loving-kindness):** The doctor's desire to help people.
    *   **Karuna (Compassion):** Helping the sick without "catching" their distress (like not arguing with someone who wants to fight).
    *   **Mudita (Sympathetic Joy):** The "placebo effect" of a cheerful, positive bedside manner that uplifts the patient.
    *   **Upekkha (Equanimity):** The doctor's ability to accept patient deaths without burning out. It's the understanding that "people die, it's not my fault; I'm still a good doctor." This is the equanimity in the face of life's inevitable ups and downs.

### **6. The Captain and the Professor on a Stormy Boat (for Upekkha as "Sea Legs")**
*   This is a vivid analogy for **Upekkha**:
    *   **The Professor:** A "landlubber" with no sea legs. He gets thrown around, sick, and unhappy in stormy seas. He represents an ordinary person buffeted by life's vicissitudes.
    *   **The Captain:** Has "sea legs." He moves with the boat's motion, steady and unperturbed. He represents a person with **Upekkha**, who can skillfully handle the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" without losing balance or peace.

### **Summary of Core Metaphorical Themes:**
*   **Skill Acquisition:** Meditation is repeatedly compared to learning a **skill** (building a base camp, learning sea legs, a doctor honing bedside manner).
*   **Journey & Return:** The path is a **journey upward** (to peak experience) and a **return downward** (to integrated wisdom), transforming the traveler.
*   **Attitude is Key:** The shift from "I wish" to **"I can"** is the engine for progress, emphasized in the mountain climb and sprinter stories.
*   **Wealth as Abundance:** Spiritual progress is framed as becoming truly **wealthy** in inner resources, leading to generosity and stability.

These stories and metaphors make the abstract meditative states (Jhanas, Sukkha, Piti, Upekkha) relatable, practical, and grounded in familiar human experiences of achievement, challenge, and professional skill.
