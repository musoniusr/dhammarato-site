### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Turn it on because it's Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Alex.

**Speaker B:** Hello, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't look like that it started yet. I see the stop recording, but it's still sitting at zero, so I don't see it moving. Do you have the counter?

**Speaker B:** It shows Dhammarato is recording the call, but it does not show a counter.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. Hmm, I don't know whether to start with it like this or not, right? If you don't mind— never mind, it's not important. Okay, we need to edit the first part of this to take that out. So if we're already recording, I'm going to go ahead and start. Um, in any case, uh, you're asking a question about the four foundations of mindfulness called the Satipatthana Srotapanna. Here the word Sati is translated into mindfulness, and I'm not sure that that's even anywhere near the best word to use, but I haven't come up with one. And so using Sati as Sati in Nepali and explaining it and what it means. But first, let's look at the Four Foundations, because the Four Foundations were the original physics of the time of the Buddha, that now we have 92 elements and counting depending upon what CERN can do, but that in the time of the Buddha there were only 4 elements.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that the elements, it seems that the way that it's structured has to do with how hot something is. For instance, water is solid when it's cold enough, right? Water then is a liquid when it is the temperature that we have, that is somewhere between on Celsius scale 0 to 100 is when water is liquid, right? And then after it gets to 100 degrees, then it becomes a vapor that we call steam specifically, right? And then if you get something extraordinarily hot, then the water itself will break down into molecules. And if it gets even hotter than that, then the molecules themselves will break down into what is called a plasma. Okay, now back to the original. The people could see that. They could see that the earth and trees and things were solid, and that there was liquid, there was water, there was There was blood that would spill, etc., like that. And then there was some strange thing called fire that would consume, and that it put off a byproduct of smoke. And even if without the fire, the smoke is still in the air. Okay, so these four things then were the four original elements in very primitive times. And the Buddha recognized— the most important point that I'm talking about is that the Buddha recognized that the problem of the spiritual life and the spiritual practice was not to meditate upon these four elements that existed both internally and externally, but primarily the meditations around the external. But that he taught to do this on the inside, so that in the old time they would have kasina meditations for the, for the earth. They would have water meditations, and which now have become crystal meditations, and, uh, that they have in let us say, the New Agey stuff. Yeah, okay. And then we've always known about fire meditations. In fact, Western groups have had retreats on fire meditations. Yeah. And that, uh, then there are sky meditations that we can see solid evidence of, that in fact we can see three major groups coming from air meditations. One would be astronomy. Yeah, I know, because they're looking up in the skies at night.

**Speaker B:** The other one is almost in the state of Samadhi.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, that's what they would do at night instead of going— instead of watching, uh, the television soap operas, right? They'd watch the sky soap operas. Actually, they would watch the sky. When they started seeing the sky as a soap opera at night, that's where we get astrology.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, how cool.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so astronomy is like, uh, taking the television apart and seeing why it works the way that it do. And, uh, astrology is watching the, um, uh, the movies.

**Speaker B:** Yep, telling a bunch of stories.

**Speaker A:** Making up stories.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Oh, that's so cool.

**Speaker A:** And then the third one, which is more recent, would be meteorology, or the study of the weather. Yeah, because the meteorology— and the meteorology was there in the first place. And in fact, the meteorology kind of became the word God for us. Now here's where that comes from. Is because, uh, you know that the teaching of the Buddha has to do with anatta, or not atma. Well, the word atom also, in fact, it comes from, um, the Indo-European language, and in Greek it's called an, uh, atmo, which we get for our atmosphere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and the original idea was, is that the air around us was alive, that God is in the air. Yeah, at night there's no end to it. The sphere of all of the stars and the sphere of the air seem to be alive. Clouds move, weather comes, uh, you know, that, um, the old understandings of God, that he threw lightning bolts and he did the thunder when he he was unhappy and he cried, rained, and all this kind of stuff. And the Buddha taught that there is no real entity or God or personality, that the air or the atmosphere has no personality. It just has functions.

**Speaker B:** This does what it does.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so when the Buddha took this into the internal foundations He's using the same thing. It's the old physics. But what he's talking about is that the person, the human being with the human body, when he is alive, he has fire. When he has fire, he has movement or fluidity. And when he has fire and fluidity, he also has a byproduct called the Anicca, or We can think of them as thoughts, or we can think of them as the way that things are moving and changing. Okay, and we can do that because this is a very interesting way of the distinction between the way that is described in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, Sutta Number 10, and the way it's defined in the Anapanasati Sutta. Yeah, we have to take all of that together in the two suttas because it's looking at it from two frames of reference. Okay, but everything, the, the, uh, the, the foundations or the physics is both true on the inside and on the outside. But all the spiritual life that the meditators, and even he with the four jhanas and the kasinas and the all of those kind of meditations didn't liberate us, that the austerities that he did weren't liberating, and the jhanas that he was doing were not liberating. And much of the reason for that was because all of the meditators were using external objects. And so what the Buddha decided was, is that we need to focus on the internal reality, the internal physics, the physics of the body itself, the feelings.

**Speaker B:** The mind, the attention moves.

**Speaker A:** Well, the mind is actually the fire. The mind is fire. In fact, Arahant Anicca has written a book And the name of the book was Mind Like Fire Unbound.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So what that means is that the mind is actually the fire. Now, one of the ways that I speak about it is imagine that you've got an old pot-bellied wood stove.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. The wood stove itself is the body. It's going to be there. It's physical.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. And then, uh, the kindling and the wood are actually the feelings, right? And the fire itself is then the mind, the burning. That's the whole point. And then you have the smoke that goes up the chimney. So there's your four foundations right there in the stove. And the kind of wood that we put in the stove determines the kind of fire that we're going to have. That in fact the Buddha uses this as an example of consciousness in the sense that you have wood stoves, you have gas stoves, you have grass fires, wood fires, let us say wood that is not fit for burn because it's got mud on it. It's stinky if it's been, uh, uh, in pieces or any of that kind of stuff. Okay. Yeah. And also, uh, we could bring in the analogy of, well, how is the stove itself and the fire and the wood inside the stove? What kind of air vents does it have, right?

**Speaker B:** How well can it move it out?

**Speaker A:** The airflow, which is the Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** The spirit is in the air. You cannot have a good fire without the air, just like you cannot have a good human being without it breathing.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So you can see all of these analogies. All this history actually helps make sense as to why we're doing these four foundations of mindfulness, is because that's our reality. The whole Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** And this is what I was thinking when I was thinking on the word mindfulness and the word discernment, because Sati, if it's used like discernment, what we're doing is we're discerning the wood quality, we're discerning how roaring the fire is based off of whether or not we're oxygenating it well enough. We're discerning what posture the wood stove is in, because if it's over on its side, we need to stand it up before we put the wood inside. So we discern all of these.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're getting that. You're understanding it, right? Okay, so this is a really good analogy. They didn't have cast iron wood stoves, so the Buddha didn't use that analogy, but we can because we understand it. Okay, but he had similar things, right? And, and so we talk about, in the sense of the mind, we talk about consciousness then is determined by the kind of fuel, right?

**Speaker B:** Because those are like our, our Sankhara.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Oh, that's so amazing. Because that's how it works in Paticcasamuppada as well. Yes, these mental formations that we have, or we talked before, we used the word determinations. Or even I also like the word activities, but I don't know if I like it as much as determinations.

**Speaker A:** Well, but in fact our determinations bring rise then to our activity.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And the act of determining is active, I feel like sometimes. Like we engage in perception.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, uh, the Buddha— there's a, there's a sutta where the Buddha is comparing what his teaching is to.

**Speaker B:** Um.

**Speaker A:** The way that the Brahmins taught. Now, the way that the Brahmins taught is actually the way that our legal systems, old British common law, etc., was built upon this, in the sense that If you do something to hurt someone, then you've done something, and that's a big act, and you could go to jail or in prison or in the stocks or flogging or death because of your actions. Okay, and then the next one, the level below that, is speech. And that normally white-collar crime has to do with papers and documents and speech and information. Yep, right. But we actually are having a whole lot of trouble in our legal system making thought. Okay, so that's one of the things that, that the, uh, that they're doing is what was, uh, Donald Trump's intention, what was in his mind. And so in, in this regard, the Brahmins would say that, uh, an action is like carving something in stone. It's going to be there, to where our vocal is very much like writing it down on a piece of paper that's kind of temporary. Yeah, okay. And then our thoughts are like writing in the air or writing in water, and it's so fluid that our thoughts just move away. Okay, you can write your name or you can write an entire constitution in the air and it's gone before you get it finished writing, right? Oh, okay. So this is the way that the Brahmins thought, was that there is nothing to the mind, there is very little to the speech, that the actions are the big deal. Hmm. Okay. And our common law is based upon that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the Buddha turns that upside down. And he says, oh no, monks, the mind is the forerunner. You cannot have a speech unless you've thought it out. You cannot even talk to me and use English language sentences unless you're thinking about what you're speaking right now. A lot of the speech that we have is sort of like, um, uh, stored stuff. It's kind of like a quick cut and paste rather than having to rethink it out or retype it out, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is really dangerous to use our own cut and paste system because we're often cutting and pasting into something that doesn't fit reality, but different context. A word like that, an example would be when we're in pain We say ouch or oh, or make some sort of noise.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so in that regard, just taking it on to the side here, going down the rabbit hole, that if you are being tortured, the torturers want to see results of their torture. Right. And the guys who are stoic in the sense that they won't say anything when they're being tortured get tortured a whole lot more. But if you're screaming like a banshee every time they touch you, they get annoyed with it, but they don't hurt you nearly so much because they think that they're hurting you because you're screaming about it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right. But all of this is just those stored things that are stored in Anagami and they're triggered. Okay, like what would you say if you stump your toe? In the dark? Oh, oh, exactly. All right, where does that owl come from?

**Speaker B:** Just been there.

**Speaker A:** It's been there because you— the first owl that you said when you were a child, in fact, first thing that the human being says upon getting slapped in the butt by the doctor.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** I don't know that they have changed that, but back in the 1960s 40s, that's exactly what to do. I remember, I remember it well. There I was sitting in my hot tub, everything was taken care of. I didn't even have to pick up my drinks, and all of a sudden an earthquake happened. The bottom dropped out, and the next thing I know, Dr. Young is holding me up by the, by the heels, beating my ass. Well, I let out a yell so loud I didn't stop yelling until I was about 35 years old.

**Speaker B:** Good, I don't blame you.

**Speaker A:** I'm still 35 years old. That's when I arrived to Swatso and Moke.

**Speaker B:** I love it, that's amazing.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that yelling that we do, right, is inbred. Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we have these, um, we're predisposed to DNA, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes. And a whole lot of the language that we use is that way. It is automatic that it comes out, okay? Um, like, uh, Dad telling the kids to shut up when they are making noise. That's an automatic response that he has to the feelings that he has if he doesn't like the kids making noise. Right. And in fact, he may be watching television. Exactly. So let us give the example that Dad's watching the, uh, the movie or watching the news, and now the kids make an especially loud noise, and that's when he gets annoyed, and that's when he says shut up, and he's not even aware that he's annoyed.

**Speaker B:** Yep. And he's right back into it. Boom. And he has no context.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** He's lost all his context. He's not aware of the currently persisting feeling. He's not aware of the mind already there in his experience, or the body. He's not aware of the Dharma. He was caught off guard by it.

**Speaker A:** Now, a lot of the students will say when they start meditation that what will happen is that they'll have a feeling And that they'll talk about that feeling as kind of original without recognizing that those feelings, every one of them, is triggered by the mind. Yeah, every one of the feelings that we have is triggered by the mind. The mind is the forerunner.

**Speaker B:** It is.

**Speaker A:** And that part of the process of the meditation is to start recognizing that feelings don't start things off. The mind starts things off.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, just as a reference, there are the Pali words is kaya nupassana. You can see the nupassana, the vappassana, or the movement and the knowledge of the body. And then there is Vedana nupassana, which is knowledge of the movements of the feelings, and then there is Citta Nupassana, which is the mind, and then there is the Dhamma Nupassana, which is all of the events, all of the smoke that we put out and the air that we go in, and all of the movement including the arising and falling, or the temporariness, the rotting away, the dying and the relinquishing. Disagreement. All of that is part of the Dhamma Nupassana. I'd like to back up though, one little point about the Citta Nupassana. In the Pali, there are two different words for it, and the two different words are like Manu and Citta.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and Manu is— what is it? It's different. I don't see it used as often.

**Speaker A:** It's the higher part of the mind. In fact, you could say that the Manu is makes us a man or a human. Okay, the man is the higher part. I see. And then the Citta is actually the lower part of the mind.

**Speaker B:** And is that why sometimes you see it translated as heart-mind?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That's in fact what we're talking about, that in English language we have the distinction between following your mind and following your heart. And the Christians give the worst possible advice to follow your heart, when in fact it is the heart that's the problem.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it traps the mind.

**Speaker A:** Okay, then in fact the higher part of the mind doesn't need so much training, but the Citta, which would be also called the reptilian brain, or the lower part of the mind, is where the feelings originate, even though the feelings are all experienced in the body, right? And the sense of anxiety is because of adrenaline in the system, um, and all of that kind of thing, okay? And so the feelings are somewhere between, and the education or the messaging system for the body, right? And so, and so, um, we can then we see that, we can make some changes to the way that we feel, but not directly to the feelings, but rather we're going to make the changes to the feeling through the mind, because the mind is the forerunner. Okay, so if the student is sitting there in meditation and recognizing that he has anxiety and is wondering where it came from, It came from the unwholesome thoughts that he was having before he experienced the anxiety. And if we can change our thought systems from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts, then we can change the feelings that we have from unwholesome feelings to wholesome feelings. Or we can also talk about it in the sense of bad feelings versus good feelings. Now, basically, bad feelings and good feelings are the distinction between I like it and I don't like it, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So the kind of feelings that we can have when we don't like it would be fear, anxiety, anger, grief, remorse, all those kind of feelings that we have that are downers.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But if it's pleasant, then we can go into those feelings that are talked about in the Sukkha, which would be feelings of safe, feelings of secure, feelings of comfort, feelings of satisfaction. So the feelings of ill will or not liking things is actually a kind of dissatisfaction. That's the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very much so.

**Speaker A:** What we can then begin to practice is that if we can change the mind, we can change the way that we feel, because the mind is the forerunner.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And a lot of students have trouble figuring this out. Because they're so slow that they can only see how they feel. They can't see what triggered that or how they talked themselves into it, right?

**Speaker B:** And this is one of the reasons that we must have— oh, I'm gonna butcher the Pali— uniso maniscaro.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure. You must have killed it.

**Speaker B:** We must have. I did. It's bad, but it's, um How can you say it in English? Mindfulness with clear comprehension, or attention rooted in reality. Attention rooted in context, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it does make sense that way.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because almost all of our bad feelings are built in Yes, their DNA, or another way of talking about it, it is instinctual.

**Speaker B:** Yes, then we don't recognize that they arise first, meaning I don't control them directly. There's no button I can push, there's no knob I can turn directly. When I don't realize that, then I, I, then I pick them up, I identify with them. And I start to think that they're me, mine, that they belong to somebody, that they can even be owned. That's what I was trying to say when I talked about if the body is first, my sense of self is not mine, you know, because I recognize it's all just already there in the situation, enduring as a basis for everything else that's taking place.

**Speaker A:** Same way, actually, that may be true only when we're slow. Remember back when we were saying that the mind is the forerunner?

**Speaker B:** Yes, right. Yes, because mind, it all is in mind. Everything is in mind.

**Speaker A:** All right, so think about a steam locomotive. That locomotive is not going to move, it's not going to blow its whistle, it's not going to do anything until it's got fire. And when the fire operates, it operates by making steam feelings, and these feelings drive the pistons of the locomotive.

**Speaker B:** And that's why there's the pursuit, the reward, and the escape.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure about that. You're talking about a time sequence, but that doesn't fit with the steam engine because the steam— what I was saying.

**Speaker B:** Was We have a feeling, it causes a pursuit of some sort that then rewards us, that makes us feel okay with listening to the need to move in the future. Whereas that's the conditioning, you know, conditioning the formations to have the same response in the future. Whereas if we see the danger in pursuit, then we know we don't have to. The reward is not worth it.

**Speaker A:** All right. Back to the steam engine, then the natural thing would be that we sometimes— the steam engine is on the wrong track.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's heading for danger. Yeah. And that we need to bring it to a stop. And the most natural way— okay, so here's the big thing. Let's take it from, in fact, the steam engine or locomotive into a ship, because a ship has no brakes. Right, right.

**Speaker B:** And it's a very good example because it's like the mind in that if you point it in one direction, since it has no brakes, it needs to burn off the energy in order to go back the other way. So if we get really wholesome, it doesn't automatically become ruined at the first instant because we have composure, because we're established in the wholesome through discernment. Well, so I like that ship. That makes sense in my head.

**Speaker A:** Well, the point is, is that you're a whole lot further ahead of me in the story, but I'm talking about how things get started and you're talking about how to bring it to an end, and we're still looking at how things operate.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, I get excited. Okay, I'll have to slow myself down.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so in, in that regard then, the mind is the forerunner of the Piti Anapanasati gives rise to the feelings of liking and not liking. And if those feelings are ignorant, it leads to actions like wanting, craving, doing something to get something. And our— in this regard, our steam engine winds up hitting a brick wall or going off a cliff because it's on the wrong track, right?

**Speaker B:** Because it doesn't recognize that it can't actually do it that way.

**Speaker A:** So what we're talking about is then we need to take— slowly take, because of the way that the mind operates— to slowly start taking the fire out of the boiler, right? Out of the firebox. We have to take the water, or take the fire out, so that the water, our feelings, is not so hot. Which means that now the water is not hot enough to push the pistons, and the steam engine begins to slow down and stop.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, you know that, uh, on an old steam engine, they had two operators. They had the pilot or the engineer, and then they had the fireman. And what's the fireman's job? Is to keep shoveling coal or wood into the firebox. Pots, right? If you don't keep putting fire in there, that steam engine is going to slow right down and stop. So something inside of us has a fireman that keeps pushing and keeps putting the fuel into the mine, right? Okay, so back to the boiler now. We've— excuse me, back to from the pot-bellied stove that we were talking about. Now we've got that pot-bellied stove on tracks, and become a locomotive.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So not only is the byproduct steam, uh, from the steam, the byproduct from the steam is also from the fire, the smoke. It's also the motion, the movement.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So the air that's around us is constantly in motion.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That smoke doesn't just sit there. It's in movement. Yes, especially if you're thinking about a locomotive. The smoke goes up into the air and the engine is moving right along, so there's a trail of smoke on top of the— the smoke is, is staying more or less kind of where it was, but it looks like that there's a trail of smoke because the, the engine itself is putting out the smoke is moving. This is a good analogy then for the way that the human behaves, is that we have these fire— we have fire in the belly, and that fire is not a feeling. The feeling is the result of the fire in the belly, or the fire that's actually in the mind, right? So, so the way that we practice is to stop putting that kind of fuel into the fire, right? Stop putting those kind of thoughts in the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And we need to practice this because we're the firemen that is such a bad habit of just shoveling coal and shoveling coal and shoveling coal out of a bad habit. We need to start figuring out when is the right time to put coal in and when is the time to stop putting that coal in and start putting something better in.

**Speaker B:** Because one of the habits I see from the fireman so far is he doesn't care what kind of fuel goes in. Like, when he first—.

**Speaker A:** He'S just shuffling. Yeah, exactly. Just don't let it.

**Speaker B:** And the mind is just fucking ripping through it. So, you know, I feel for the fireman. He's got a job to do. But wouldn't it be nice if he could just sit down for a second and be a little more selective? Because that— yeah, I see that analogy.

**Speaker A:** That's very good. So this is where we begin then to practice our meditation, is to tell the fireman to take a rest, stop putting that fuel in, because the mind is the forerunner for those feelings. And yet the students will— in fact, the common situation is, is that, oh, I need to meditate. I'm not sure why, I just don't really like my life, I want it to be better, right?

**Speaker B:** It's kind of magical thinking with a.

**Speaker A:** Lot of magical thinking.

**Speaker B:** If I sit down and I do this, then someone will come along and pop, I'm gonna get enlightened.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so when they do sit down, when they do sit down, all they see that's come is their anxiety. Yeah, their fear, their, uh, dissatisfactions with life. And they don't recognize that all we need to have the fireman to stop putting that stuff in, to stop having the kind of thoughts that bring on the adrenaline that keeps the anxiety and the fear moving, right?

**Speaker B:** It's like the man that's walking quickly. But the fireman finds himself walking quickly.

**Speaker A:** So the fireman, the human meditator that's sitting there, when he's out of our old habits, when he sees that the mind has wandered away, when he sees that he is shoveling coal and recognized that for at one time he wasn't shoveling, but now all of a sudden he's shoveling. And the way that we would talk about what it is in the Goenka sense is, when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. Right? Okay. So that means then that the fireman was actually taking a rest, he was watching the breath, and now the mind has wandered away from the breath, means that now he started shoveling coal again, and when he wakes up to that, he starts shoveling coal even harder with the kind of thoughts of, oh, I can't meditate, oh, this is really hard, oh, I wish I could have done it before, and all these kind of really unwholesome shoveling jobs that we have. That what we need to do is instead remind ourselves that, hey, I caught myself shoveling coal again. Yeah, let 'Please rest, let me stop doing that.' 'Let me have lunch, let me have something wholesome and stop putting all of this coal into the belly of the fire.' So this is the analogy that we can use then for the Satipatthana. This is it, this is that steam engine that we have, and if we would stop feeding the coal to it, then the fire would settle down, it wouldn't be so hot. And because of the mind, the fire is not so hot, we don't generate so much steam from the— from the— our feelings are not steamy anymore, they're cool.

**Speaker B:** They are cooling. They may even quench.

**Speaker A:** And exactly. And because of the quenching of that that steam, the cooling off of the water, the steam engine comes to rest. It stops. And so having the kind of thoughts of no place to go and nothing to do, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself, and I've got no worries, no place to go, we start talking to ourselves. The engineer, in fact, is giving the firemen orders to stop feeding the coal, to stop having things to do, to stop looking for activities, to stop thinking that we're going to solve a problem by moving the steam engine down the track. But the steam engine will be a whole lot better off. Yeah, if it would slow down and sometimes even come to a stop, right?

**Speaker B:** Just let it be.

**Speaker A:** So that's the way to talk about it, the Sattva, Tanha.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the steam engine, the pot-bellied stove, the ship.

**Speaker A:** And stop feeding the fuel. Or the first thing, in fact, going back to the analogy of the pot-bellied stove, or let us say, uh, the fireman, that when he refuels— yes, which means that he fills back up the coal, uh, car, right? Or he fills up the wood car again. Let's make sure that he's getting good fuel. So this is the beginning. We, we, um, we could, if we were very sharp as practitioners, look at every shovel of coal, every thought. Right, right. But most meditators are not sharp enough, so what we're going to do instead is saying every time you refuel, we're going to get wholesome fuel, not unwholesome fuel. Right, we're going to start having— this.

**Speaker B:** Takes out some of the work, because if we can watch the mind, the behavior is going to behave itself.

**Speaker A:** So there's two jobs of the fireman. The first job of the fireman is to start using good fuel, start having happy thoughts, start having easygoing thoughts. Stop putting, let us say, mossy, dirty, muddy fuel in, right? In case of a cold coal car, we want very, very strong— I think it's called anthracite— that we don't want to put bituminous, and we certainly don't want to put peat in there because peat doesn't give much heat and it puts a lot of smoke out. Yeah, okay, so there's various kinds of coal. So for the, uh, in that regard, we need to choose what kind of coal we're putting in, or what kind of wood, what what kind of fuel we're putting into the fire. And then we recognize that every moment we have a choice: are we going to have wholesome thoughts or unwholesome thoughts? And now eventually, if we can really get it to the point that we know we can control it so that we have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought, we can begin to put some gaps yeah, between those wholesome thoughts. So the first thing that the coal, uh, the fireman has to learn to do is to start, instead of shoveling poor coal or poor quality thoughts, now we're going to start shoveling high quality thoughts. And then after that, we're going to start not shoveling so many wholesome logs. We're going to start shoveling fewer logs. We're going to put some gaps between these wholesome logs. If we put gaps between unwholesome logs, then we're still going to have a lot of stinky stinky, right? So we want to have high quality. That's the first thing that we learned to do is start putting high quality wood in, or high-quality coal. And then the next thing that we learned to do is to put some gaps between those logs that we're shoveling in, not putting so many shovels of coal in, to take a break, let the thing cool off. So the first thing that we're going to do is to stop having such a stinky mess. And then eventually we're going to have even less. And so now we're actually beginning to put the fire out.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right.

**Speaker A:** So that's a way of practicing. That would be then the way of saying it like this: you've heard good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. Okay, so the good in the beginning means we're starting to put really good high-quality fuel in. Good in the middle means we're not putting so much fuel in, we're putting some gas in there. And then good in the end means we've run out of fuel.

**Speaker B:** Quenched. Done.

**Speaker A:** We've quenched it out. We've let it go cold.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the first part of it is, is that we've got a really, really stinky bad fire. We're getting some progress, but oh, what cost it is. I mean, we've got a really, really dirty environment. We've got all kinds pollution. We've got stinky smoke coming out. But when we practice in the beginning, we can begin to clear the air, begin to see things a lot better, right? I have a cleaner environment. But then we begin to say, oh well, if that's the case, I can even clean the place up even more by stop shoveling so much coal. Good in the middle means we're not putting so much effort into it, we're just sitting there and relaxing. And the third part then is, is that, hey, wait a minute, I don't have to put coal in this thing, let's just let it coast. Maybe we can let it coast for.

**Speaker B:** The rest of our lives, just see what it does.

**Speaker A:** And let it slowly come to an easy, happy stop. Yeah, now when I'm talking to students, I have to keep track of where they are in this so that we can talk about it in the sense of, are we going to have really just wholesome thoughts, or are we going to put some gaps in those thoughts? That in fact, you could say then that the first Jhana is that we're very selective of what kind of fuel we're putting in. We're not putting in muddy logs anymore, we're not we're not putting in peat anymore. We're putting only really high-quality fuel into the mind.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And then the second Jhana would be that we're beginning to not put so much coal in, that we're putting some gaps in there.

**Speaker B:** And that's why Vitakka and Vichara leave.

**Speaker A:** And then the later part of it would be then is that we've kind of run out of fuel. That's the heart, is just.

**Speaker B:** Be the Anicca.

**Speaker A:** So there's your Satipatthana. You've got the locomotive itself, you've got the steam for the, uh, for the water, uh, uh, storage, and you've got the wood that burns, and the wood that burns is actually the feelings. The wood itself is the feelings that we have. Yes, as well as the steam that's produced. And then the steam, the feelings, move the locomotive. So that's a good analogy for the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.

**Speaker B:** It is. I really like it. It's really helpful. I'm going to remember it. I can dig it. And when we look at it in that way and we see that in that way, it helps to arouse dispassion, helps to arouse renunciation, helps to arouse the— I guess renunciation is kind of like that last step of Anapanasati, throwing, throwing back. Is that the same idea?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's amazing. I love that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's bring this call to a close.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir, it sounds good.

**Speaker A:** And then we'll— I'll call you and we'll talk about, um, uh, the stuff on the website. We'll put some hope on that one. All right, so we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right then, see you in a little while, man. Take care.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, Dhammarato provides a detailed and practical analogy to explain the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana)** and the core principle that **"the mind is the forerunner"** of all experience.

### **Core Teaching Summary:**

1.  **The Mind is the Forerunner:** The central, repeated point is that our feelings (pleasant/unpleasant) and subsequent actions do not arise randomly. They are **triggered by the mind's thoughts**. Unwholesome thoughts lead to feelings of anxiety, fear, and dissatisfaction (Dukkha), while wholesome thoughts lead to feelings of safety, comfort, and satisfaction (Sukkha).

2.  **The Four Elements as Foundational Physics:** Dhammarato frames the Four Foundations (body, feelings, mind, mental phenomena) using the ancient model of the four elements (earth, water, fire, air). This isn't about meditating on external elements, but understanding our **internal "physics":**
    *   **Body (Earth):** The physical container (like a pot-bellied stove or a locomotive).
    *   **Feelings (Water/Steam):** The fluid, moving sensations that arise. Their quality (hot/steamy or cool) depends on the mind's fire.
    *   **Mind (Fire):** The central element. It is the burning engine of experience. The quality of the "fuel" determines the quality of the fire.
    *   **Mental Phenomena (Air/Smoke):** The byproducts and atmosphere—thoughts, perceptions, and the constant flow of change (Anicca).

### **Key Analogies:**

Dhammarato uses two main analogies to make this dynamic clear:

1.  **The Pot-Bellied Stove / Locomotive:**
    *   **The Stove/Locomotive:** The physical **body**.
    *   **The Fuel (Wood/Coal):** Our **feelings and mental formations (Sankhara)**. The *quality* of the fuel matters.
    *   **The Fire:** The **mind (Citta)**. It burns the fuel.
    *   **The Steam/Smoke:** The resulting **actions, speech, and flow of mental phenomena**.
    *   **The Airflow (Anagami):** The essential factor of **attention and awareness** that feeds the fire, akin to breath.

2.  **The Fireman:** This represents our habitual mental activity. We are constantly "shoveling" thoughts (fuel) into the mind (fire). Our practice is to:
    *   First, **switch to high-quality fuel** (wholesome, happy, easygoing thoughts).
    *   Then, **shovel less often**, creating gaps between thoughts.
    *   Finally, **let the fire go out** by ceasing to add fuel, leading to calm and quenching (Nibbana).

### **Practical Meditation Path:**

The talk outlines a progressive path using the analogy:

*   **Good in the Beginning (First Jhana):** Be selective. Stop shoveling "muddy" unwholesome thoughts (anger, worry) and start shoveling only wholesome, high-quality thoughts.
*   **Good in the Middle (Second Jhana):** Create gaps. Don't shovel even wholesome thoughts so frequently. Let the mind settle and cool down as mental activity (Vitakka & Vichara) subsides.
*   **Good in the End (Third/Fourth Jhana):** Let the fuel run out. Allow the fire of craving and agitation to quench completely through non-fueling, leading to peace, dispassion, and renunciation.

### **Important Clarifications:**

*   **Sati (Mindfulness)** is likened to **discernment**—the ability to see what kind of "fuel" is being used, how hot the "fire" is, and the state of the "stove."
*   The **Citta** (heart-mind) is distinguished as the more instinctual, feeling-based part of the mind that needs training, not the higher, rational faculty (Manu).
*   The Buddha reversed the Brahminical view that actions are primary. Instead, he taught that **mental intention is primary**, as it precedes speech and action.

**Overall Message:** Liberation comes from turning attention inward to the internal "physics" of body and mind. By using discernment (Sati) to see that the mind is the source, we can take responsibility as the "fireman." We learn to starve the fire of unwholesome fuel and eventually let it cool, leading from a chugging, polluted locomotive of suffering to a peaceful, quenched state.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used in this talk are:

**1. The Four Elements as Ancient Physics:** The talk begins by framing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (*Satipatthana*) through the lens of the Buddha's time, comparing them to the four classical elements (earth, water, fire, air/wind). This sets the stage for understanding internal experience using this "physics."

**2. The Pot-Bellied Wood Stove / Locomotive (Core Extended Metaphor):**
This is the central, detailed metaphor used to explain the mind, feelings, and the process of meditation.
*   **The Stove/Locomotive Body:** Represents the physical body (*kaya*).
*   **The Wood/Coal (Fuel):** Represents feelings (*vedana*) and mental formations (*sankhara*). The *quality* of the fuel (wet/muddy vs. dry/high-quality) determines the quality of the fire.
*   **The Fire:** Represents the mind (*citta*), specifically its active, burning aspect. (Reference is made to the book *"Mind Like Fire Unbound"*).
*   **The Steam:** Represents the byproducts of the mind—thoughts, activities, and the sense of change (*anicca*). Steam drives the pistons (actions).
*   **The Smoke & Air:** Represent *Dhamma* in the sense of all phenomena, the atmosphere of experience, and specifically the spirit or vital principle (*anagami* is linked to airflow). Air is essential for fire, just as breath/spirit is for life.
*   **The Fireman:** Represents the part of our awareness that habitually "feeds the fire" by generating thoughts and reactions. Meditation involves training the fireman to first choose better fuel (wholesome thoughts), then to shovel less often (create gaps in thinking), and finally to let the fire go out (cessation).

**3. Writing in Different Mediums (Story/Analogy):**
Used to contrast the Brahminical (and modern legal) view with the Buddha's teaching on the primacy of mind.
*   **Action:** Like carving in stone (permanent, most significant in common law).
*   **Speech:** Like writing on paper (temporary).
*   **Thought:** Like writing in water or air (vanishes instantly, considered insignificant).
The Buddha "turns this upside down," stating that mind (thought) is the forerunner of all else.

**4. The Steam Ship (Supporting Metaphor):**
Introduced to illustrate the mind's momentum and the need for skillful redirection.
*   A ship has no brakes. If you point it in a harmful direction, you must burn off momentum to change course. Similarly, a mind established in wholesomeness has momentum and composure, not easily ruined by a single unwholesome thought.

**5. The Torturer and the Stoic (Anecdote/Story):**
A brief story to illustrate automatic, stored reactions (*sankhara*).
*   The torturer expects a reaction (screaming). The stoic who doesn't react gets tortured more. This shows how our ingrained, automatic responses (like yelling "ouch") are conditioned strategies for navigating the world.

**6. The Baby's First Yell (Personal Anecdote):**
A humorous personal story from the speaker about being born to illustrate that our reactive patterns (like yelling) are deeply ingrained from the very beginning of life ("inbred" or DNA-level).

**7. Dad Yelling "Shut Up" (Common Scenario):**
A relatable story of a father annoyed by noisy kids while watching TV. It illustrates how reactions arise automatically from unexamined feelings, triggered by the mind losing its context and mindfulness.

**8. The Three Stages of Fuel Management (Metaphorical Framework):**
This framework maps the meditation path onto the fireman's training:
*   **Good in the Beginning:** Select only high-quality fuel (wholesome thoughts). Analogous to the first *jhana*.
*   **Good in the Middle:** Shovel less fuel; create gaps between thoughts. The fire cools. Analogous to the second *jhana* (where *vitakka* and *vicara*—initial and sustained thought—fade).
*   **Good in the End:** Stop fueling altogether; let the fire go out and the engine coast to a stop. This is quenching (*nibbana*), renunciation, and cessation.

**Summary:** The talk uses a **master metaphor of a fire-driven system (stove/locomotive)** to make the abstract teachings of *Satipatthana* tangible. This is supported by **contrasting analogies** (writing in stone/air), **everyday stories** (dad, the torturer), and a **personal anecdote** to ground the ideas in experience. The overall narrative arc moves from explaining the ancient "physics" of the mind to providing a practical, mechanical model for training and calming it through meditation.
