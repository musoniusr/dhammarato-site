### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hello friends, today is Sunday, December 28th, and today we will talk about the Fire Sermon. Also to mention that Mikey is not here to help me get outside to the other computer, so I'll be talking.

**Speaker B:** On.

**Speaker A:** My bed here. As you probably have heard, I lost the ability to walk, so due to old age, I think, and that Anagami disease. So to start off with the fire sermon, it's kind of complicated to just jump right into the fire sermon. But it's good to give a little bit of a background. First of all, this is referred to often as the second sermon that the Buddha gave, but actually there was another sermon that was given to the five Bhikkhuni on the day after the Dhamma Chaka Puja. So technically The Fire Sermon is the third sermon that he gave, but it's really important because he gave it to a group of ascetics. And these ascetics called themselves fire worshippers, led by Lama Kalama, who had about 500 followers. And he had two who also had about 300 and 200 each. And so altogether there were 1,000, uh, ascetics in this sermon. Probably the, uh, the sermon kind of refers to the fact that they were already ordained by the Buddha and had become Bhikkhus. There is some controversy about that, as it seems that this sermon was in fact the blow where a lot of them did ask the Buddha to ordain. Now, the leader, Kamma, Uh, this is an interesting story that, uh, he was considered an Arahant by all of his followers, and they did ritual fire meditations, fires, having rituals of fires with the understanding that fire was purification and the rituals themselves, while they were, let us say, possibly entertaining and giving experiences of divine, or experiences of divinity, uh, and yet they were not free, not yet. So the story is that the Buddha went to that fire temple and just said basically, hey, can I hang out here? And, uh, Arhant said, okay, sure, you can hang out here, but beware that the, uh, there's a fire demon that lives here at night. And so I guess they were all waiting. I assume, just speculating from a Western modern terminology, that the entire ascetics got together and pumped up with a bellows pumped up the air to make the fire really big to scare him, also with a lot of noise of the bellows blowing. And so the Buddha spent the night there, no problem. Then in fact, it's said that he put this fire demon into his bow. I assume what that meant was the ashes, or perhaps the unburned wood that came from the fire. Now, uh, Kamma saw this. He says, this Gautama is powerful, but he is not as enlightened as me. He is up to my level as an Arahant. And so the Buddha hung around there, didn't teach anything, didn't ask for any followers. He just hung out. And I think that they tried to test him in several ways, uh, and he showed his mastery basically by not doing much of anything. And finally, after many days, Kamma kept saying over and over to himself, Gautama has power, but he is not as powerful as I am. But then I think what happened was is that Kamma was doing one of the rituals that he was doing, and dissatisfied with it because it wasn't giving him, um, the kick that he expected it to give him. And from there he began to question and eventually says, this Katana has something, some path that I don't have. In other words, he finally broke his ego. And from there he, uh, uh, came to the Buddha and, and asked. And all the Buddha said was, you know what to do. And so what? Along with many of the other, all of the other, uh, uh, long-haired, matted ascetics, they threw all of their fire equipment into the river, their bells, their tokens, their altars. They just throw it all in the river, all their fire-making equipment. And so with that, that's the map for this fire ceremony. In other words, the word fire is used by the Buddha mainly, or exactly, because these are fire worshipers. And so when they had the sermon, the Buddha said, all is burning. Your eye is burning. Your objects that the eye sees is burning. Your feelings about the eye is burning. You're clinging, or Upadana, is burning. Everything is burning, especially your experience is burning. Now what does this mean? It means then that whatever you hold sacred, you're holding it as sacred, is burning you. But in fact, there is nothing that's sacred, and holding to things as sacred as purification is burning you. And that this is the, uh, the main teaching. Then it's actually a short sermon because all it's doing is pointing out that everything that the fire ascetics were doing was burning them. That they are. And in fact, one of the most interesting parts that comes out of this sermon is that people who are looking for spiritual experiences, even if they have the spiritual experience, they're still running and they want more of it. And really what the object of the teaching of the Buddha is, is to become not burning, to become cool, become disenchanted, to stop putting power or interest into any of these things. This is the real teaching. And that the aesthetics got that. And so this was actually the large group founding of the Sangha. You can also go to say almost that the Buddha didn't form the Sangha. The Buddha just took the Sangha that was already formed. He already had some students. There was others that came because Mahakassapa and Sariputta did similar things and taught them, so that almost all of the original ascetics, all of the wanderers, all of the rishis of the area, wound up very quickly becoming students of the Buddha. They became Bhikkhuni. The Buddha did not in fact teach to lay people in the beginning. That long, he never really did teach the lay people, but what he did was instead would be answer the questions when lay people would come to him and they would listen to what he had to say and then become lay followers of him, and some of them ordained. So the history of how the whole thing got started, and it has to do with all of the practices that these monks were doing was just rituals that were trying to evoke experiences. Now you can see, in fact, that that's what modern Buddhism, especially Western Buddhism, retreat Buddhism, is really all about. Have a sacred room the sacred bells and special low lighting designed to give students experiences. And many of them get really jacked up on these experiences, thinking that something is special, that something is— something is out there beyond them. And that in fact, along with that and with Hinduism, they talk about unity or unification, the divine. Well, the Buddha says no, don't try to unify with the divine. For one thing, there is no you to unify with the divine. And number two, the divine has no self. It's just it. It's just the cosmos of the universe or whatever. Uh, and so in reality, then the Buddha had very little or nothing to say about the cosmos. And yet, uh, much of Buddhism winds up having all kinds of cosmological, uh, things about, uh, whether the Earth is eternal or not. Whether it existed all along or whether it was a Big Bang, or whether there's a Tusita heaven or the heaven of the 33, and all of that kind of stuff is added on. That the Buddha has no cosmology because he's only interested in what's happening right now. And right now The senses are burning right now. The mind is burning with desire, with Tanha, with Upadana, to have experiences. And that's basically what Western Buddhism then is all about, is having an experience that's good enough and big enough and profound enough. You call it an awakening, like becoming a Sotapanna. Or they think of Jhana as an experience. They want to have experiences, they want to have knowledge. And the Buddha says in this sermon, no, that knowledge is burning you, and the view that you is burning you. And that the experience that people crave for, that craving, is burning. Now, the Buddha does not say that there is no beauty. He does say is any attachment to that beauty is burning. So he does not say that there are no experiences. He's saying that the experience when you like it, when you pray for it, when you want more of it, burning you. And so this is the result of what happens with Western Buddhism, is these teachers set it up. Now, the point about the teacher is he's the one who has the students. He needs those students in order to be a teacher. The Buddha did not appoint teachers. He appointed what we call Kaliya, Metta, friends who can help you understand that you don't need a teacher. And yet you'll find all of these, um, sometimes very expensive teachers in the West that are looking for students. And so Um, that's— that becomes the problem then, is, is that the path that they have is always the path back to, uh, wanting to become a teacher, to want to have your own group. And Buddha, even in this, uh, not the sutra itself, but in the description of the sutra, which by the way is in the Vinaya This description in Mahabhagavata, by the way, this description of his encounter with Kamma shows— and in fact, it was an important point for Kamma— is that this Nibbana that came onto the scene, he's not trying to steal my students. He's not trying to give them any doctrine. He's not trying to argue with me. He is just there having fun. And that this was really hard for Kamma. Over and over again, Kamma would say, uh, this, this monk's got power. Well, not monk, but this Gotama has power, but not an Arahant like me. Until that— I'm an Arahant. Fell apart for him, and he could see it directly for himself. This is actually the best way of teaching, is to share and watch the student fall apart all on his own. No teaching necessary. And it's only after the student is ready, after he's fallen apart, after he can see that what he is wanting is burning him Only then is he ready to hear that sutta all his own fire. So it's not a sutta of, um, let us say, argumentation or anything. It's just the facts. That's just how it is. Uh, Buddha also is known to have been to other gurus and teachers.

**Speaker C:** Similar.

**Speaker A:** Kind of belief systems, and kind of hung out around them too and let the teacher himself just fall apart. And that's how the Sangha grew so very quickly. First 5, and then 60, and then the first, and then thousands and thousands after that. Until there were hardly any ascetics, any sacred folks left because they didn't keep their sacred. They went to get the practical liberation from the teacher, the Buddha himself, by recognizing that all of their sacredness was just burning them. And that they did not get liberation from it. Liberation comes by dropping all of that, to be rid of it, to have nothing to do with it. The words I translated are disenchanted, or another word would be disillusioned, or another one would be seeing directly, and so they become disillusioned, they become disenchanted with all of their practices and took up the ascetic life that they had already been living. They just did it around the time of the Buddha. Chris, do you have any questions about this or any comments to make?

**Speaker C:** So I would say that if you're interested in this, if you're a reader, then definitely read that Vinaya section. Can you hear me okay over the roosters? So there's a section in the Vinaya. You're not going to find it in Tanhisaro's book because it's not related to monk rules, but there's a whole section that gives historical account of the early days of the Buddha, including this third sermon. And it's a nice little read. It puts it all into context. If you're interested, it's better than jumping around from sutta to sutta. It just kind of hangs together. You get to see It tells more of a story. And yeah, that's the story it tells. I think the danger, the reason I'm interested in this, the danger is that it's easy for newcomers to come away from this, reading this, thinking that the moral of the story is that feelings and thoughts are the devil's playground. And to be avoided at all costs. And so that leads to disassociating from reality, withdrawing, not stable emotional maturity, not able to communicate and work effectively with other people, and just constantly practicing the fine art of avoiding responsibility. And then there's the crowd that's looking for special knowledge, the other end of the spectrum. And that's what the Vinaya version of it says, is that when the Buddha asked him to tell King Bimbisara, what changed your mind? He said, yeah, I realized everything I was doing was looking for experiences and power and attainments, and it wasn't working. And so thought's not— thought is not the problem. Seeking is not the problem. Working on it, practicing is not the problem. The problem is the very last line of that sutta, some version of Upadana. Anupadaya, I think it says, the clinging. Doing all that with the clinging, that's the problem. Chasing and clinging. So thought, sights, those aren't— if tastes are evil, that would mean you should stop eating, right? You die if you stop eating. That's not what it says. So don't stop thinking. That's my thought.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's an interesting one too. A lot of people in the West think that the path has to do with stop thinking. But the Buddha didn't teach that. This is just an idea that they have, and the way that it's practiced, no one can get the mind to stop. And the reason for that is because they're going from one unwholesome thought to unwholesome thought to another unwholesome thought. And that is, the mind is not going to stop that way. But in Sutta number 19, it talks about that we have to get the mind into what is wholesome, so that you have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. Thereby, between those thoughts, you can't place gaps. But so long as the mind is That means it is burning. You can't go from burning to no thought, and a lot of people are trying and all they get is just more burning. Another one is trying to get divine experiences. Now, one point about that that you mentioned, that's something too, and that is, is that when all of these meditation students are looking for some enlightenment experience. They keep doing that because they're— whatever person is who they set themselves up to be the teacher also is looking for that himself. And so it very much is the blind leading the blind. Everybody's looking for peak experience. Everybody is for union with the divine. And all of that is just causing more burning, more fire. And the Buddha says, just relax, just chill, baby. You don't need anything. You don't need any of that. Well, one of the things about these, um, uh, all of these aesthetics is that they were already well-practiced. They already had what they referred to as concentration or Samadhi mind. They already had, um, uh, oh, asceticism, that they already were in, uh, they had withdrawn from the world completely so that they could go into the mind. That's why they were able to become Bhikkhus and almost Arahants almost immediately, because all they needed was that one swift kick up the butt. You're still burning. So, Tino, do you have something to say? Oh, your mic is not working. Okay, I got that. How about you, um, uh, Ivan, is Ivan here? How about you, Ben? What do you think? Good talk.

**Speaker C:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I've not got any questions about the sermon.

**Speaker A:** All right, are you burning? No, chill.

**Speaker C:** Just chilling.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Paul, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** There's a line in the notes that mentions that When the Buddha taught this sermon, this was not poetic, it was surgical. I found that interesting. Am I audible?

**Speaker A:** So you're saying that the mic here is not good?

**Speaker D:** It's just a little bit more muffled than your usual one, because the one at your computer desk is quite high quality.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the headphones is good, it's the microphone we're using here, and Anicca's laptop is all of that great. So we'll revert to the other computer with the other microphone next time. So Karwan— oh, by the way, Paul, do you have any comment about the talk today?

**Speaker B:** Yes, just was saying that there was a line in the notes like, this was not poetic, it was surgical. Was wondering if you could talk more about that.

**Speaker A:** I didn't understand what he said.

**Speaker D:** He said there was a line in the notes that said, "This talk wasn't poetic, it was surgical," and he wondered if you could expand a little bit more or talk a little bit more on that point. On that point, on the fact that it was surgical, not poetic, the sermon.

**Speaker A:** That he gave— oh, it's not surgical because he used the word fire for these child worshippers. If he had been talking to another group, he probably would have given them a different talk, but he really cut right into those fire worshipers by saying that your fire worshiping is burning you on the inside, that the fire is not outside, the fire is not sacred, the fire does not purify because you have not purified Anagami inside that you're still burning. This is why it's surgical, because right to the point.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So, Karwan, do you have something to say?

**Speaker E:** What do I say about the talk of today? Tathagata was just saying, I'm in a place which I am burning, like literally almost this hot, and my mind is also very hot. So yeah, just listening to calm down.

**Speaker A:** Could you hear him, Dhammarato?

**Speaker E:** I don't know if you can hear me. I'm on— then could you hear me?

**Speaker A:** I can hear you, yes.

**Speaker E:** Okay, great.

**Speaker A:** I can hear you.

**Speaker E:** No, Dhammarato, I just said I don't have anything to say about the talk itself, but just in general, I'm now in a place, not in a best, let's say that way, I'm in Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Yanis, do you have something to say? No, not really. It was an interesting sutta. Like, it was the first time I heard about it. And yeah, like, it sounds like a nice story. Okay. You go to the.

**Speaker C:** Um, uh, the.

**Speaker A:** Call group, uh, where we announce these calls, and there I have published my notes on this, uh, because they're much more detailed than what we can do in an hour. Uh, but does anybody else have anything to say? You, Krishna, you got something to say?

**Speaker C:** Talking to me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was talking about not wanting.

**Speaker F:** With a friend, and I'm wondering now, okay, you cannot want anything, but at some point that leads to not doing anything. And I wonder where's the optimal point between not wanting and doing what's needed.

**Speaker A:** You're breaking up, so it's hard to hear what you had to say. Would you repeat what he said?

**Speaker D:** He said, um, he said, um, there's a, there's a line between not wanting anything and not doing anything at all. So where do you draw the line between not wanting anything and then doing what's needed to be done?

**Speaker A:** Well, there's a few things about wise wanting, the kind of wanting to do something. You can be rather than planning. Planning is on fire, doing maybe not. And, um, on another sutta, number 57, the Buddha talks about actions or Kamma, and he says when the action is neither bright nor are that that leads to the end of action. And all of the sutras together doesn't show Buddha ever doing much action. I don't know of any sutras— Chris, can you help me on this? Did the Buddha ever chop wood? Did he ever carry water? Did he ever make robes? I don't know of the Buddha ever doing much of anything at all. He didn't even do anything at all to the, uh, to Kamma. He just hung around and let Kamma figure out that he was the one who was on fire. So I ask you, from your question, Then you're on fire about doing things, as if you have no clinging left. They want to do— the answer is, why do anything? Or a better answer would be that when you stop clinging, when you're not on fire, then why are you calling fire trucks? Why are you out doing stuff? So this is something that you can figure out for yourself. When you stop clinging, what's there left to do? Because all the doing that you're doing is doing in order to get. You want things, and then to get them, you do things. To get things. And when you don't want anything, why go? There's no place to go and nothing to do. Now, some people would say that's boring, but that's really what they mean is, I can't do what I'm planning on doing when I'm thinking about doing it. And so I call that boredom, where in fact it's probably just planning. Just more burning. That make sense for you? Why do anything if you already got everything you need and everything you want? Why you want to go do stuff? You don't. All right, let's finish this call for today. We're calling it a little bit early. Um, does anybody have any last questions? Chris, I really appreciate you coming today. Thanks for coming. So what I would suggest is, uh, we don't have anybody to sign off, so, uh, Ben, can you, in the spirit of, um, Mikey, uh, sign this thing off for us?

**Speaker D:** Sure. Yeah, thank you everybody for coming and for listening to the talk, and Yeah, it's same time every week. There's a talk on Saturday at 9 AM Thai time and a talk on Sunday at 4 PM Thai time. And there are other talks in the week. If you're watching on YouTube, there's a link to our Discord channel in the notes below. And yeah, thank you for coming. See you again.

**Speaker A:** All right, so I recommend that everybody stay on the call after I go so that you can discuss what we've been talking about today and see if there's anything, uh, to be picked up from each other. So good night, everybody. We'll see you later. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Take care.

**Speaker F:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Subject:** A discussion of the **Fire Sermon (Ādittapariyāya Sutta)**, its historical context, and its critical relevance to modern spiritual practice.

**Main Themes & Points:**

1.  **Historical Context:** The talk clarifies that the Fire Sermon was likely the Buddha's *third* sermon, given to 1,000 fire-worshipping ascetics led by Uruvelā Kassapa. The Buddha won them over not through debate, but by calmly demonstrating superior spiritual power (e.g., subduing a "fire demon") and simply "hanging out," which eventually led the head ascetic to question his own attainments.

2.  **The Essence of the Sermon:** The Buddha used the metaphor of **"burning"** specifically because his audience were fire-worshippers. He declared that **everything is burning**—the senses, their objects, the resulting feelings, and the clinging (*upādāna*) to them. This "fire" is the fire of passion, aversion, delusion, and craving (*taṇhā*).

3.  **Radical Critique of "Sacred" Experiences:** The core teaching is a direct challenge to seeking **special spiritual experiences, states, or knowledge**. The ascetics' rituals, designed to induce divine experiences, were themselves a form of "burning." The Buddha's goal was not to provide better experiences, but to become **"cool" (nibbāna)**—disenchanted, disillusioned, and freed from clinging to any experience.

4.  **Critique of Modern/Western Buddhism:** The talk draws a direct parallel between the ancient fire-worshippers and much of modern, especially Western, Buddhism. It criticizes the focus on:
    *   Creating special, atmospheric retreats to induce "peak experiences."
    *   Mistaking *jhāna* or "awakening" for just another experience to crave.
    *   The teacher-student dynamic where teachers (consciously or not) need students to validate their own role, potentially perpetuating a cycle of seeking.

5.  **The Correct Path:** The true path is not about stopping thought or seeking unity with the divine. It is about:
    *   **Shifting from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts** (as in MN 19), which naturally calms the mind.
    *   **Letting go of clinging (*upādāna*)** to all things, not the things themselves. Sensations and thoughts are not the problem; craving and clinging to them are.
    *   **"Chilling"**—relaxing the compulsive need to get, become, or experience something special.

6.  **The Ideal Teacher-Student Relationship:** The Buddha is presented as the model. He didn't recruit or argue; he **"let the student fall apart all on his own."** True spiritual friendship (*kalyāṇamittatā*) helps you see you don't need an external authority; it points you back to your own investigation to see what is "burning."

**Key Distinction Made:** The problem is **not** sights, sounds, thoughts, or actions themselves. The problem is the **clinging, craving, and identification** with them. The sermon was **"surgical"**—a precise, targeted incision into the specific delusion of its audience (fire as purifying) to reveal the inner fire of suffering.

**Conclusion:** The Fire Sermon is a timeless call to examine one's spiritual motivations. It warns against the subtle craving for profound experiences and spiritual status, advocating instead for a path of disenchantment, release from clinging, and ultimately, a cool, unburned mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **1. The Central Metaphor: "All is Burning"**
*   **Source:** The Buddha's Fire Sermon (Ādittapariyāya Sutta).
*   **Meaning:** The Buddha uses "burning" as a metaphor for the suffering (dukkha) caused by craving (taṇhā) and clinging (upādāna). The senses (eye, ear, etc.), their objects, and the feelings and perceptions associated with them are all "on fire" with desire, aversion, and delusion.
*   **Contextual Twist:** The speaker emphasizes that the Buddha deliberately used the metaphor of **fire** because he was addressing **fire-worshipping ascetics**. It was a "surgical" use of their own sacred symbol to show that their external ritualistic pursuit of purification through fire was actually perpetuating an internal "burning."

### **2. The Story of the Buddha and Uruvelā Kassapa (the Fire-Worshipping Ascetic)**
This is the main narrative used to frame the talk:
*   **The Setup:** The Buddha visits Kassapa, a revered leader of 1,000 fire-worshipping ascetics who believes himself to be an arahant.
*   **The Test:** Kassapa warns the Buddha of a "fire demon" in the temple. The ascetics try to intimidate the Buddha by stoking a huge, noisy fire. The Buddha stays unmoved and is said to have subdued the "demon."
*   **The Buddha's Method:** The Buddha doesn't preach, argue, or try to steal followers. He simply "hangs out," demonstrating peace and mastery without doctrine. This passive presence creates cognitive dissonance for Kassapa.
*   **The Turning Point:** Kassapa, dissatisfied with his own rituals which no longer give him the expected "kick," finally has his ego "break" or "fall apart." He realizes the Buddha has a path he lacks.
*   **The Result:** Kassapa and all his followers ask for guidance. The Buddha simply says, "You know what to do." They throw all their fire-worshipping equipment (bells, tokens, altars) into the river and ordain as bhikkhus. This story illustrates that true teaching sometimes involves **letting the student "fall apart" on their own** through direct observation, not through argumentation.

### **3. The Metaphor of "Coolness" vs. "Burning"**
*   **Meaning:** The goal of the Buddha's teaching is contrasted with the state of burning. It is to become **"cool"** (a synonym for Nibbāna), **disenchanted**, and **disillusioned** with the pursuit of sensory and spiritual experiences.

### **4. The Metaphor of "The Blind Leading the Blind"**
*   **Used to critique:** Modern Western Buddhism and retreat culture.
*   **Meaning:** The speaker argues that many modern teachers and students are collectively caught in the same trap as the ancient ascetics: seeking special **peak experiences**, "awakening" as an event, or unity with the divine. This pursuit itself is a form of "burning" (craving). The teacher, needing students for validation, and the students, craving experiences, perpetuate a cycle where everyone is "burning" together without finding the "cool" liberation of disenchantment.

### **5. The Story of the Sangha's Formation**
*   **Narrative:** The talk frames the early growth of the Sangha not as the Buddha aggressively recruiting, but as seasoned ascetics and wanderers (like Kassapa's group, Sāriputta, Mahākassapa) recognizing the futility of their own sacred practices. They saw their rituals and spiritual seeking as "burning" them and were naturally drawn to the Buddha's path of disenchantment. The Buddha "just took the Sangha that was already formed."

### **6. Contrasting Metaphors: "Surgical" vs. "Poetic"**
*   **Meaning:** The Fire Sermon is described as **"surgical, not poetic."** This means it wasn't a general, flowery discourse. It was a precise, targeted intervention using the audience's own framework (fire) to cut directly to the root of their misunderstanding and suffering.

### **7. The Simile of "Gaps in Wholesome Thoughts"**
*   **Reference:** Mention of Sutta 19 (likely the Dvedhāvitakka Sutta).
*   **Meaning:** Countering the modern idea that meditation is about "stopping thought," the speaker suggests that the mind naturally settles when it moves from **one wholesome thought to another wholesome thought**. The "gaps" between these thoughts are where calm is found. Trying to forcibly stop "burning" (unwholesome) thoughts directly only creates more struggle and "burning."

In summary, the talk uses the **core metaphor of "burning"** and the **extended story of Uruvelā Kassapa** to argue that the Buddha's essential teaching is about becoming disenchanted with all forms of craving—including spiritual craving for experiences and attainments—which is presented as the true, often overlooked, meaning of the Fire Sermon. This is then applied as a critique of modern spiritual consumerism.
