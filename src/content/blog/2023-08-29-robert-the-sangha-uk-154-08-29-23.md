### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Diving into the text, does anyone have anything they'd like to discuss?

**Speaker B:** I'm good.

**Speaker C:** Good.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** And Alex, anything to add?

**Speaker B:** Anagami? Nope.

**Speaker A:** Okay, great. So let's dive into it.

**Speaker B:** Let me pull up the text here. Okay, cool. So we left off on page 8 last time. So for the newcomers, I will do a little recap. Let's see here.

**Speaker A:** Start sharing.

**Speaker B:** So let me expand this. So basically what the first dialogue discussed, or not the first dialogue, the first part of the dialogue discussed was it basically set the groundwork for the second part, like the background. And so Socrates is at the market, also called the agora, and he meets this fellow Euthyphro. Who is basically seeking to take his father to trial over kind of a complex situation. So I'm just going to reread the introduction here before returning to the rest of the dialogue, and you guys can feel free to pop in if you have any questions or comments, etc. So the dialogue, Euthyphro. The scene is the agora, or central marketplace of Athens, before the offices of the magistrate who registers and makes preliminary inquiries into charges brought under the laws protecting the city from the gods' displeasure. There Socrates meets Euthyphro. Socrates is on his way in to answer the charges of impiety brought against him by three younger fellow citizens, on which he is going to be condemned to death, as we learn in the Apology. Euthyphro has just deposed murder charges against his own father for the death of a servant. Murder was a religious offense since it entailed pollution which, if not ritually purified, was displeasing to the gods. But equally, a son's taking such action against his father might well itself be regarded as impious. Euthyphro professes to be acting on esoteric knowledge about the gods and their wishes, and so about the general topic of piety. Socrates seizes the opportunity to acquire from Euthyphro this knowledge of piety so that he can rebut the accusations against himself. Little side note, so piety in the context of Greek religion, you know, wasn't necessarily this adhering to, you know, really pronounced faith, right? It was more about acting in like a righteous and ethical way. So you can consider piety to be on par with virtue as opposed to like a nebulous faith in gods. So however, like all his other interlocutors in Plato's Socratic dialogues, Euthyphro cannot answer Socrates' questions to Socrates' satisfaction or ultimately to his own. So he cannot make it clear what piety is, though he continues to think that he does know it. Thus predictably, Socrates' hopes are disappointed. Just when he is ready to press further to help Euthyphro express his knowledge, If indeed he does possess it, Euthyphro begs off on the excuse of business elsewhere. Though Socrates does not succeed in his quest, we readers learn a good deal about the sort of thing Socrates is looking for in asking his question: what is piety? And the other what-is questions as he pursues in other dialogues. He wants a single model or standard he can look to in order to determine which acts and persons are pious, —one that gives clear, unconflicting, and unambiguous answers. You want something that can provide such a standard all on its own, as one of Euthyphro's proposals that being pious is simply being loved by the gods cannot do, since one needs to know first what the gods do love. Pious acts and people may indeed be loved by the gods, but that is a secondary quality, not the essence of piety. That is not that which serves as the standard being sought. There seems no reason to doubt the character of Socrates' sincerity in probing Euthyphro's statements so as to work out an adequate answer. He has in advance no answer of his own to test out or to advocate. But does the dialogue itself suggest to the attentive reader an answer of its own? Euthyphro frustrates Socrates by his inability to develop adequately his final suggestion that piety is justice in relation to the gods, in serving and assisting them in some purpose or enterprise of their own. Socrates seems to find that an enticing idea. Does Plato mean to suggest that piety may be shown simply in doing one's best to become as morally good as possible, something Socrates claims in the Apology the gods want more than anything else? If so, can piety remain an independent virtue at all with its own separate standard for action? These are among the questions this dialogue leaves us to ponder. So one reason I really like the Platonic dialogues is Socrates basically does a great job of investigating and analyzing, you know, ideas that we may take for granted.. And I think it's really great to kind of apply this rigorous method of analysis which Socrates utilizes to a lot of different ideas that we come across. And that process of questioning and trying to find an answer is something I think we can all emulate. So, and a little side note on the story from the first part. So Euthyphro in the original dialogue Basically, his father had a bunch of slaves, and there was like a drunken argument between his slaves, and one slave killed the other. Another one he killed was one that was an attendant to Yuthiphro. So Yuthiphro was quite upset about this, so he basically Oh no, excuse me, actually I confused it. So one of Euthyphro's slaves, Euthyphro's attendant, killed another of the slaves in a drunken argument. And so Euthyphro's father, who owned all the slaves including the one that helped Euthyphro, tied up the slave that killed the other slave and put him in a ditch while he went to a court official to figure out what to do with the slave. Then the slave happened to die when he was in the ditch, and now Euthyphro was so upset about this that he took— that he's taking his father to court, which in Greek society is something that is very taboo. You don't take your family to court, especially not your parents, and they considered slaves property, not humans, which is very morally wrong, obviously. But anyway, so Euphifro is portrayed in this dialogue as pretty clearly acting out of kind of anger and hatred towards his father for accidentally killing the slave, and instead of some justice aspect. However, Euphifro is claiming to the courts and Socrates that he is doing what the gods would want him to do. And this is where the dialogue sort of begins, this more analytical aspect. So let's start with this one cut from Socrates. Socrates, would anyone like to read Euthyphro's part? Any volunteers? Because it's kind of in a dialogue form, so we can do it like a play.

**Speaker C:** I can do it with my bad English, but I can try.

**Speaker B:** All right, let's do it. Great. So, Socrates: Come now, my dear Euthyphro, tell me too, that I may become wiser, what proof you have that all the gods consider that man to have been killed unjustly, who became a murderer while in your service, was bound by the master of his victim and died in his bonds before the one who bound him found out from the seers what was to be done with him, and that it is right for a son to denounce and to prosecute his father on behalf of such a man. Come, try to show me a clear sign that all the gods definitely believe this action to be right. If you can give me adequate proof of this, I shall never cease to extol your wisdom. Oh, and just a little comment before Pietro's part. So this emphasis here on clarity, like a clear sign that the gods definitely believe something. This is a big part of how Socrates thinks is show me clarity, show me evidence of what you're speaking of, right? If you can give me adequate proof of this, I shall never cease to extol your wisdom. And this is a little bit of a mocking because he knows Euthyphro is wrong, but he likes to kind of play with his toy, so to speak. So anyway, Euthyphro, carry it away.

**Speaker C:** Okay, this is perhaps no light task, Socrates, though I could show you very clearly.

**Speaker A:** I understand that you think me more dull-witted than the jury. As you will obviously show them that these actions were unjust and that all the gods hate such.

**Speaker B:** Actions.

**Speaker C:** I will show it to them clearly, Socrates, if only they will listen to me.

**Speaker A:** They will listen if they think you show them well. But this thought came to me as you were speaking, and I am examining it, saying to myself, if Euphifro shows me conclusively that all the gods consider such a death unjust. To what greater extent have I learned from him the nature of piety and impiety! This action would then, it seems, be hated by the gods. But the pious and the impious were not thereby now defined, for what is hated by the gods has also been shown to be loved by them. So I will not insist on this point. Let us assume, if you wish, that all the gods consider this unjust and that they all hate it. However, is this the correction we are making in our discussion, that what all the gods hate is impious and what they all love is pious, and that what some gods love and others hate.

**Speaker B:** Is neither or both?

**Speaker A:** Is that how you now wish us to define piety and impiety? Really quick little note: So there are a lot of Greek gods. So Socrates is making the point, so if some of them love one action and others hate the action, then that action would be considered kind of neutral, right? Now if they all love something and they all hate that same, or they all hate something, that seems to be a more clear guideline as to something being, you know, loved by the gods or not loved by the gods, right? So he's making that distinction here.

**Speaker B:** So carry it away.

**Speaker A:** Pietro.

**Speaker C:** What prevents us from doing so, Socrates?

**Speaker A:** For my part, nothing, Euthyphro. But you must look whether on your part this proposal will enable you to teach me most easily what you.

**Speaker B:** Promised.

**Speaker C:** I would certainly say that the pious is what only gods love, and the opposite, what only gods hate, is the impious.

**Speaker A:** Then let us again examine whether that is a sound statement, or do we let it pass? And if one of us or someone else merely says that something is so, do we accept that it is so, or should we examine what the speaker.

**Speaker B:** Means?

**Speaker C:** We must examine it, but I certainly think that this is now a fine statement.

**Speaker A:** So this is great because Socrates is kind of putting Euthyphro in a corner here when he's saying, like, are we just going to accept, you know, that something is pious or not, or should we examine it, right? And the obvious answer is to examine. Right? Especially if you're dealing with some serious topic. So he's kind of pushing Euthyphro in a certain direction. So he's saying, we shall soon know what better— whether it is. Consider this: is the pious being loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is.

**Speaker B:** Being loved by the.

**Speaker A:** Gods?

**Speaker C:** I don't know what you mean, Socrates.

**Speaker A:** I shall try to explain more clearly. We speak of something carried and something carrying, of something led and something leading, of something seen and something seeing. And you understand that these things are.

**Speaker B:** All different from one another and how they.

**Speaker C:** Differ? I think I do.

**Speaker A:** So what he's talking about in this.

**Speaker B:** Case is there's a difference between an object and someone acting on that object. So he's creating the distinction there between something being loved by the gods and something that is worth being loved by the gods, right? So those sound kind of different, but he's trying to say like, what is it in this piety thing that is actually loved, you know.

**Speaker A:** Versus the act.

**Speaker B:** Just the act of it being loved itself. And then Socrates says, so there is also something loved and a different thing something loving. Oh, sorry, of course.

**Speaker A:** Tell me then whether the thing carried is a carried thing because it is being carried or for some other reason.

**Speaker C:** No, that is the reason.

**Speaker B:** And the thing led is so because it is being led, and the thing seen because it is being seen.

**Speaker A:** Certainly.

**Speaker B:** It is not being seen because it is a thing seen, but on the contrary, it is a thing seen because it is being seen.

**Speaker A:** Um, nor is it because some— it—.

**Speaker B:** Nor is it because it is something led that it is being led, but because it is being led, that it is something led. Nor is something being carried because it is something carried, but it is something carried because it is being carried. Is what I want to say clear, Euthyphro? I want to say this, namely, that if anything is being changed or is being affected in any way, it is not being changed because it is something changed, but rather it is something changed because it is being changed. Nor is it being affected because it is something affected, but it is something affected because it is being affected. Or do you not agree?

**Speaker C:** I like it here because it's like we were talking Buddhism about cause and effect, you know.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yep. No, you're totally right. And I think this is like a common mistake that people make, is that because something is receiving a certain effect, we believe that that thing is what it is because of the effect, not just that it is what it is. So we do this all the time, you know, in our perception, right? And this is something to be mindful of. And this is where Dharma can come in here is, you know, we affix like, I like it, I don't like it, you know, or good, bad to things all the time. And we assume that's what it is instead of pausing to say, is this really, you know, what I'm saying it is, or am I just saying it is what it is, or am I just saying that it is a certain way, right? So, you know, if I like, you know, this little booklet, you know, that's just what we often invest in these perceptions. So I can invest in the perception of this booklet is good because I like it, not just this is a booklet, right? So it's like we have to investigate and examine the way that our perceptions affect our general reality, right? Like, to what degree are we constructing our reality versus just perceiving, right? And that's what Socrates is basically asking.

**Speaker B:** Thibault here is, you know.

**Speaker A:** Are we just perceiving this thing or is this thing actually special in some way? Like, how do we disentangle the cause from the effect? How do we disentangle the perception from the reality? So yeah, a lot of Dhamma here. So anyway, carrying on, is something loved either something changed or something affected by something?

**Speaker B:** Certainly.

**Speaker A:** So it is in the same case as the things just mentioned. It is not being loved by those who love it because it is something loved, but it is something loved because it is being loved by them.

**Speaker B:** Necessarily.

**Speaker A:** So yep, right there. It's not liked because it is something that is liked. It is liked because people are liking it. So anyway, what then do we say about the pious, Euthyphro? Surely what is being loved by all the gods, according to what you say, Yes. Is it being loved because it is pious or for some other.

**Speaker B:** Reason?

**Speaker C:** For no other reason.

**Speaker A:** Is it being loved then because it is pious, but it is not pious because it is being loved? Apparently. And yet it is something loved and God-loved because it is being loved by the.

**Speaker B:** Gods. Of.

**Speaker A:** Course. Then the god-loved is not the same as the pious, Euphro, nor the pious the same as the god-loved, as you say it is. The one differs from the.

**Speaker B:** Other.

**Speaker C:** How so.

**Speaker A:** Socrates? Because we agree that the pious is being loved for this reason. But it is pious, but it is not pious because it is being loved. Is that not so?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So right there, Socrates is making the distinction between the actual thing and the way we react to that thing, or the gods react to that thing. So he's disentangling the cause from the effect. And that the god loved, on the other hand.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, this is not a Dhamma talk in the traditional Buddhist sense. It is a **philosophy discussion group** analyzing Plato's dialogue *Euthyphro*, with occasional connections drawn to Buddhist concepts.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Core Activity:** The group is reading and analyzing Plato's *Euthyphro*, a dialogue where Socrates questions a man named Euthyphro about the nature of **piety** (or holiness). Euthyphro is prosecuting his own father for murder, claiming his actions are pious and aligned with the will of the gods. Socrates probes whether something is pious because the gods love it, or if the gods love it because it is inherently pious.

**Key Points of Discussion:**

1.  **The "Euthyphro Dilemma":** The central philosophical problem is dissected: Is an act pious because it is loved by the gods, or do the gods love it because it is intrinsically pious? The group notes Socrates argues for the latter, distinguishing the **essential nature** of an act from the **gods' reaction** to it.

2.  **Connection to Dhamma/Buddhism:** The participants explicitly connect Socratic inquiry to Buddhist practice:
    *   **Examining Perception:** They compare Socrates' method to the Buddhist practice of investigating perceptions. Just as Socrates questions whether an act is pious in itself or merely labeled so, Buddhists investigate whether things are inherently good/bad or if we project those qualities onto them.
    *   **Cause and Effect:** They highlight the similarity between Socrates' logical distinctions (e.g., "something is seen *because* it is being seen") and the Buddhist principle of dependent origination, which examines the chain of cause and effect in experience.

3.  **Socratic Method as a Tool:** The facilitator (Speaker B) praises Socrates' rigorous, questioning approach as a valuable tool for analyzing taken-for-granted ideas, suggesting this method can be emulated in everyday life and spiritual inquiry.

**Conclusion:** The session is less a guided Dhamma talk and more a **shared intellectual exploration** where classical philosophy is used as a lens to examine fundamental questions about reality, ethics, and perception—questions that naturally resonate with and illuminate core Buddhist teachings on investigation, perception, and the nature of qualities.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain and contextualize the philosophical discussion. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. The Story of Euthyphro (Narrative Frame)**
- **What it is**: The entire dialogue is framed around Plato’s story of **Socrates and Euthyphro**.
- **Purpose**: It serves as a **case study** to explore the definition of piety, justice, and the nature of knowledge.
- **Key elements**:
  - Euthyphro prosecuting his father for murder (a taboo in Greek society).
  - Socrates questioning Euthyphro’s certainty about what the gods want.
  - The tension between social norms, divine command, and personal ethics.

---

### **2. The “Clear Sign” or “Clear Proof” Metaphor**
- **What it is**: Socrates repeatedly asks Euthyphro for a **“clear sign”** that the gods all agree his action is just.
- **Purpose**: Represents the **Socratic method**—seeking unambiguous, rational evidence rather than appeals to authority or personal conviction.
- **Example**:  
  > *“show me a clear sign that all the gods definitely believe this action to be right.”*

---

### **3. The “Carried/Carrying” and “Seen/Seeing” Analogies**
- **What it is**: Socrates uses **relational pairs** to illustrate the difference between **essence and effect**.
- **Purpose**: To disentangle **cause and effect** in defining piety.
- **Example**:  
  - Something is “carried” **because** someone carries it (not that it is inherently “carried”).  
  - Similarly, is something pious **because** the gods love it, or do the gods love it **because** it is pious?
- **Connection to Buddhism**: Speaker A explicitly links this to **Buddhist cause-and-effect reasoning**, noting how we often confuse our perceptions with inherent qualities.

---

### **4. The “God-Loved vs. Pious” Distinction (Metaphorical Logic)**
- **What it is**: A **logical metaphor** for separating **definition from consequence**.
- **Purpose**: To show that being “loved by the gods” cannot be the **essence** of piety—it’s merely a byproduct.
- **Example**:  
  > *“the pious is being loved for this reason… but it is not pious because it is being loved.”*

---

### **5. The “Marketplace of Ideas” Metaphor (Implied)**
- **What it is**: The **agora** (marketplace) where the dialogue occurs is itself a metaphor for **public debate and the exchange of ideas**.
- **Purpose**: Emphasizes that philosophical inquiry happens in the open, subject to scrutiny.

---

### **6. The “Toy” Metaphor**
- **What it is**: Speaker B describes Socrates as **“playing with his toy”** when questioning Euthyphro.
- **Purpose**: Illustrates Socrates’ **ironic, probing style**—engaging with Euthyphro’s claims not to humiliate him, but to expose contradictions.

---

### **7. The “Model or Standard” Metaphor**
- **What it is**: Socrates seeks a **single model or standard** for piety—like a **measuring stick**.
- **Purpose**: Represents the search for an **objective, universal definition** rather than subjective or conflicting opinions.

---

### **8. The “Dharma Lens” Analogy**
- **What it is**: Speaker A explicitly connects Socratic questioning to **Buddhist mindfulness and perception analysis**.
- **Purpose**: To show how examining our assumptions (like “this is good because I like it”) is a cross-philosophical practice for seeing reality more clearly.

---

### **Summary of Metaphorical Themes**:
- **Clarity vs. ambiguity** (clear sign, clear proof).
- **Essence vs. attribute** (carried/carrying, loved/loving).
- **Social and divine authority** (Euthyphro’s story as a cautionary tale).
- **Philosophy as a tool for disentangling perception from reality** (linked to Buddhist and Socratic practice).

These metaphors and stories help the speakers **demystify abstract philosophical concepts** and relate them to ethical reasoning, mindfulness, and everyday critical thinking.
