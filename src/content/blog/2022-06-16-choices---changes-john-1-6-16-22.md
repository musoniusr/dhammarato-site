### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So your mic is actually quite noisy.

**Speaker B:** There it is. Is it really?

**Speaker A:** That's much better that you hold it away from your shirt. That's what— okay. So, John, good to meet you. Um, I'm glad to hear that you have been doing some Goenka retreats. And it's interesting, one of the things that happened with students that have Goenka retreats is that they have a long time between them. But it looks like that you've been able to pack 3 retreats in 5 years, which is going in the right direction for sure. And so you and I have a base to talk about because you're getting ready to go back into another Goenka retreat. So I understand.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So as we had just mentioned, you and I had been talking about that Goenka has a technique and that Vimalamsi has a technique and Jhana Taro and others have a technique. And that— but I don't have a technique. It doesn't belong to me, that I'm passing down something that I learned. But it's actually more complete. Basically, what you can say is that the basic question is the cause and effect in this regard, that Metta is the effect of good practice. It is not the cause or the good practice. It's the result of good practice. And so they've got the cart before the horse in a way. And also issues of noting practice, that noting and then not doing anything about it. Is going to just leave you noting whatever is there, and you're going to get very good at noting, and you're going to be picking through your own mental garbage forever until you wind up in some dark night of the soul or something. And so there's something missing in that practice. And then there's do-nothing practices like choiceless awareness. Where the reality is, is that all along the way, in all of these cases that we've mentioned and a few more, the point about making choice is the issue. That in fact, if we're not making changes and we're not making choices, then we're almost stuck or bound by destiny or whatever to be reborn as the same old thing again and again and again until we When are we going to change? When are we going to wake up? Time is now. And so that's basically a lot of what's wrong with the practice in the sense of Sati. They don't put the emphasis upon that any moment, any present moment that you have, now is the time to wake up. And so it should be practiced. One of the ways that I say about Sati is that We can develop a set of skills, but often when we need those skills the most, we don't apply those skills because we forgot about them, we're too fearful, or whatever. And so what's good a skill if you don't remember to use it at the right time? And so this is the value of Sati, is to remember But you need to remember to wake up. And basically what that means is to come out of that sixth sense, the mind, which has to do with the past and the future and someplace else, and come into the other five senses, which are the here-now, to be present. And this is what is the issue about Sati and the point about then the right noble view is to look at what's going on with wisdom, to look and see what's happening. And then the next item on the Eightfold Noble Path is the right effort to change, to do something new. Means to remove unwholesome thoughts and to put wholesome thoughts in the mind. And there's many suttas that talk about that. Wow, there's just many. One of them is Two Kinds of Thoughts, Sutta 19 in the Majjhima Pitaka. And there it talks about two kinds of thoughts, and it's got a beautiful story that will tell you something. And then in 117 It has it specifically that one's right effort is to remove unwholesome thoughts and replace them with wholesome thoughts. And then in the Anapanasati Sutta, right next to it, it talks about the skill of gladdening one's mind, to investigate the mind and then to gladden the mind. Now this particular point, this right effort is something that seems to have gotten soft or gone missing in all of the various methods, but it's right there and clear in the text that if we practice correctly, that means that we're waking up and checking what's going on and then climbing the ladder a step or two, which means then that any thought that you're having right now could be improved. Think of it like that. Go around checking, is this thought right now good enough? Is it wholesome, or can I make a change to it? Start climbing that Noble Noodle Ladder. And this is the way that we begin to change our thoughts. Gladden the mind, find things that are more wholesome than what we're thinking about. And generally, if we're thinking about something way over yonder, some big wide world or anything like that, a society or a country or whatever like that, that's far too way, it's not real. If I say the word Ukraine, you'll get an image that's different than the one that I have. And so when we use the word Ukraine and think about Ukraine, that's just merely a mental concept. And we're missing out on what's happening right in front of us. And so this is what Sati is, and also the waking up to look at what we're doing, to look at what we've been thinking, and recognizing we can change what we're thinking, including changing it into watching what's going on right around us.

**Speaker B:** So that's the biggest thing, I guess, right? I mean, among many other things in Guancas. Instead of just looking at it, you know, instead of just looking at it and, you know, looking at the trash, you're not doing anything about it. So I guess what other things it's missing? Because again, I mean, you made it clear that you don't have a technique and you don't want to, or essentially, and there's a reason for that, I'm sure.

**Speaker A:** I don't want to get blamed for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Which is fine. So I guess, I mean, you've done the, done Guenka for a long time. So I mean, what is not satisfying for you? And would one be going down the wrong way, obviously, if they didn't know the Eightfold Path and what we talked about before? As you mentioned, it's missing the Sati, and a lot of the times Goenka doesn't talk about taking long, deep breaths. You know, and the most important thing is to be mindful. And there's this big thing in the West, and you brought this up with strong determination and meaning.

**Speaker A:** Right effort is the way that I would describe it. I've been waiting for you to list them all and you didn't. Okay. And okay, so that's the point. That I would say that all of the systems are generally missing is the point about the right effort to make a change right now and improve the situation, to come back to the reality instead of lost in space or lost in time.

**Speaker B:** So that's the biggest thing that was missing, you think? The biggest thing, the right effort to.

**Speaker A:** Learn to literally take control of your own mind. Start looking at what you're doing, and in that process, to literally take control of the breath. This is basically a control issue in a very broad sense of the term, because primarily most people in our society was raised as starting as a child. I mean, we just start off as a victim. We start off as a tender infant that needs to be taken care of. And somehow or another, we really don't get out of that and we remain a victim. And the practice of Anapanasati has actually got more built into it than just the Eightfold Noble Path. But the Eightfold Noble Path kind of starts it off. You could say that the entire beginning stone or the whole top of the pyramid is the teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's the only thing that the Buddha teaches, and everything fits in within that package. And then the next layer down is the Four Noble Truths, and then down on one, uh, the leg of the Eightfold Noble Path. And then another one is the Second Noble Truth, which goes into Piti, Samuppada, And then the third noble truth is what is also built into Anapanasati, which is the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path. So all of this stuff kind of sits in layers and fits together. And so with right effort of changing the thoughts from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought, We also, with Anapanasati, control the breathing by beginning to pay attention mindfully. In fact, the sutta actually says, "With Sati, he breathes in long," or in the English, we would say, "Mindfully, he breathes in long, and mindfully, he breathes out long." And then that phrase is taken to each one of the other stages, including— and when I say stage or step, I'm not talking about in chronological order of practice, I'm talking about an order of appearance, sort of like a play. These are the way that things appear, and the body is first, and then the feelings, the Vedana, and then the Citta. So Upadana, 9, which is the beginning of the Citta, is talking about examining the mind. Pay attention to what the mind is doing. Look at the states of mind. Is the mind tired? Is it sharp? Is it focused? Is it dull? Is it watching what's going on? Is it not paying attention? Is it in la-la land? Or is it in its own hell that it's just created? These are the kinds of states of mind that we have, and we need to look at what kind of state of mind that we've got. And then the next is to gladden that, to pick that up, to make a change. And so this is one's right effort. This is how the Eightfold Noble Path fits into the Anapanasati practice that's laid out in the Anapanasati Sutra. So mindfully he breathes in long, examining the mind, and mindfully he breathes out long, examining the mind. This is a skill. Thus one trains oneself, become to be able to do that. And then flattening the mind, mindfully Mindfully he breathes in long, gladdening the mind, and mindfully he breathes out long, gladdening the mind. Thus one trains oneself. That's basically quoting right the sutta.

**Speaker B:** So why were you dissatisfied then?

**Speaker A:** Dissatisfied in what?

**Speaker B:** With the, with the blank.

**Speaker A:** Well, Goenka doesn't teach what I'm teaching you now. That's not part of what Goenka says. He says watch the breath. He does not say mindfully take control of it and then use that control to change, to examine, and to gladden. So he's missing both the control and the gladdening part. Sorry, I didn't know that's strong enough so that you caught it.

**Speaker B:** No, I get it, I get it, I get it. You know, since you grew up in the West, I would take it, you know, it seems that's one method where may be more popular than the others. So with obviously Goenka no longer here, do you see that possibly dying out, or is there— who could else replace that, or is it just meant to be? You know, because as you mentioned, there is things missing.

**Speaker A:** Well, the funny thing about the Noble Dharma is that If you can see it, it becomes self-evident. It's not so cryptic and hidden when it's presented correctly. And for that reason, the noble Dhamma will get out. In fact, I've already seen that. I've been quite impressed with the changes that Western Buddhism has gone through in the past 20 years— or not 20 years, the past 10 years. Few years, let us say the past 5 years. In the past 5 years, this whole teaching of joy and gladdening the mind and developing Sukkha, which is actually part of the Anapanasati practice, and that development then is one's right effort. One has to take the effort to develop skills. And the skills that one needs to develop are right there in the Anapanasati Sutta, and when you develop these skills, each one in its own way brings the mind into the first Jhana, which is the gathering of the factors. So when you have the skill of removing the hindrances from the mind, throwing the unwholesome Bhikkhuni breathes out, click number 1, and continuing to do that over and over and over again, and then developing Sukkha, mindfully he breathes in, developing Sukkha, mindfully he breathes out, developing Sukkha, and I'll talk about what that means in a moment, mindfully breathing in, developing Piti, and mindfully he breathes out, developing Piti. Doing these things, he's applying the mind to the wholesome and sustaining the mind to the wholesome, while back at step 4, in the body, we were examining and watching the body all of this while, stage 3, which is the scanning method of Goenka Gongwa. And then step 4, the real point, is the relaxation of the body. Now in some of the other suttas, relaxation is included with the 5, making it 6 factors, and in some suttas it only has 5 factors, but you can see where that extra added "and the body is relaxed" would be valuable because that fits in with Sukkha, because Sukkha actually defined is in the Pali dictionary is comfort that is preceded by a feeling of safety and security. Safe and secure, we sit and feel comfortable, and as we sit and feel comfortable, we begin to feel satisfied, partly because we're talking ourselves into it with the gladdening of the mind and having wholesome thoughts about sitting here and saying, "My, how nice it is." I got no place to go and nothing to do, and the bell is going to be yet an hour away, and I don't have to worry about that at all because I'm having fun here, just being satisfied with doing nothing. And so this is the development of the Sukkha, and pretty soon you begin to feel satisfied. Wow, it really is great to have nothing to do and no place to go. This is what the whole idea of retreat is all about, is somehow or another People get wrapped up in work. Have you ever heard that from Goenka?

**Speaker B:** Work. And you mentioned something too, that the lazy— I don't know, please, if I'm not saying this right— the Western mind, you could say, essentially thinks or is lazy, or how would I want to put this? A lazy way would be Western mind to work, whereas I guess you could say in some Eastern countries, like currently here in Nepal, they're just— it seems a little more relaxed, where, you know, the West is a total different lifestyle in the sense of just constantly work, where there's no, you know— is that something that you mentioned?

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is the whole point about the question of what is Right Effort. Because most of the time people are putting in either not enough or too much effort. Basically, we're putting in too much effort for too long, get tired, and then we stop putting any effort into it at all. We quit because we're exhausted rather than putting in the right effort. And if the right effort is the right effort, it will continually perk up the mind to gladden the mind. To bring the mind out of the hindrances into the noble light of day to see what's going on. And so with that, and tying it together with the breath, now we're beginning to do two control things that we've never done before. One is that we're learning to control the mind and its contents and its state And the other one is beginning to control the body in the sense of making the body alive and awake, just like Goenka practices, to become in touch with the body, to see what the body is, and to notice where the tensions are and relax them so that you can in fact become relaxed. To where a lot of students wind up with back pain and butt pain and knee pain and all kinds of stuff. And that is truly and clearly not relaxed and not comfortable, and therefore not conducive to bring the unwholesome thoughts about such pains and misery and 'I want out of here' and wanting things. And they're not satisfied. And so we have to practice in a way that our body remains comfortable and relaxed. That's what this practice is. So all of these ideas of work and all of that kind of stuff has to do— yes, that's correct, it is referring to right effort. I'm sure that he was, but I didn't understand it that way. I understood it the Western way instead, which is actually the word struggle. Or strive instead of persist. Correct. Okay, great, you got it. Now we're cooking. That's the point, is we keep going. It's repetitive, it's over and over. Mindful in this moment, mindful in this moment, mindful in this breath, mindful to throw that throw it out, mindful to throw it out again, mindful when it comes back a third time. We don't have a fourth thought of, oh no, here it's back again. We just throw that thought out and come back to, oh wow, Anicca is so nice, I don't have any problems at all. Because any problem that comes to mind, I throw it out and come back to the present moment. Because right now you don't have any problems. The room you're in is very safe. So why do we keep having thoughts of things that are fearful? All the dangers, all the problems, all the possibilities that could be, instead of recognizing that right now we don't have to deal with any of that stuff. And there you're going into retreat with literally nothing to do and no place to go. And so take a break with right noble effort rather than the struggle of trying to strive and get something.

**Speaker B:** So why do— I mean, I hate to put people in categories, but why would some people find the technique of Vipassana so hard while others.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy it?

**Speaker B:** I don't know if that would—.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of— it's actually referred to as the 16 stages of insight that is often waved around by people who are into Mahasi, and it comes out of the Suttimagga and has roots in Paticcasamuppada. You know that 16 stages?

**Speaker B:** I heard you and Daniel Ingram talk.

**Speaker A:** A little bit about it, but you.

**Speaker B:** Could fill me in, please.

**Speaker A:** All right, the reason that I'm mentioning it is, um, that there comes a point after that sequence of events that is referred to in the U.S. and other Western culture of a dark night of the soul, because there's no— there's no soul at all, because actually it's a redoubling of the effort, which means now The click is that the student decides he's going to have to practice correctly from now on, because what he's been doing has been wrong. This is the Great Awakening. The question is, why can't we teach that directly, that you've got to make some changes here? You can't practice the way that you've been practicing. You're going to have to make a change. And what is that change? Guess what? That's step 11. And step 12 is the Eightfold Noble Path again, the Four Noble Truths. And so that's where I want to start the students, is at step 12 of this thing, rather than, you know, whatever dark nights they've already had. That's sufficient. We've had that enough. Let's stop doing that now and start practicing correctly, because the actual teachings of the Buddha, as you've probably heard, is referred to as good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. Have you heard that? Then where is the dark night of the soul in that?

**Speaker B:** And what are you actually referring to, dark night of the soul?

**Speaker A:** I'm referring to steps 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the 16 stages of insight. Brought to you to the West by Mahasi's students. Step 6: Fear, misery, disgust, despair, anguish, and a strong desire to get out of that. The point that I made, which was then a redetermining of effort to get it right this time. But some people have to hit rock bottom before they turn around. That's in fact quite well known in AA. Court-ordered AAs don't generally work. But when somebody hits the point to where they know that they're hurting themselves with with what they've been doing, they're willing to make a change.

**Speaker B:** Would you say you hit rock bottom before you had to make a change?

**Speaker A:** No, that's the whole point, was no, I— well, it depends upon what it got. I mean, things get rocky, sure, right? But it wasn't anywhere near anything that I would consider rock bottom. No, I've been able to cruise at quite an altitude my whole life. But before, I would soar, and now I can soar. So no, that— but that's what happens, is people generally have to come to a point that they do see that what they're doing isn't working. And they've got to make a change. That's what wound me up in Asia. That's what wound me up in psychology.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So how did you really get into meditation and kind of leave America and then go into Asia and India?

**Speaker A:** And in Ann Arbor, Michigan, there was an ashram that was visited frequently by Muktananda. A Swami from Ganeshpuri, India. And so I followed him over back to India. And at that time, I was professoring at a university and had plenty of time off. So I spent 4 months a year in India for several years and then wound up staying.

**Speaker B:** And so what made that switch, said, I'm done teaching? I mean, it's time to, you know, do something else. I mean, that's not— everyone's going to go ahead and leave their comfortable, you know, job that's paying and go and do what you did.

**Speaker A:** That's the point. Is it really that comfortable, or is it the fear, the terror that prevents them? So when does the terror and the pain get balanced to the point that somebody says, I've got to make a change here. Do they have to hit hard bottom, or they have to be just mildly dissatisfied and pretty smart about it and go do something about it?

**Speaker B:** This is a good point. It's a frame of mind looking at it.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I said it's all in the mind of how you look at it. I mean, Yeah, I get it. So I guess when you went, you did 2 years with Cuenca and you traveled around. You said you met many charlatans, as you say, that just weren't— that just weren't.

**Speaker A:** Convincing enough. Sure, fair enough.

**Speaker B:** And then you went to Asanaguanca. So, and then you went to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and something about him kind of set off for you. You said something about his retreat was harder than others, and you spent some.

**Speaker A:** Time— No, the hardest retreat I ever did was with Upandita, who was a student of Mahasi. That was the hardest one.

**Speaker B:** No, why is it so hard?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Why was that so hard?

**Speaker A:** Number one, I would say offhand, we didn't connect. But number two, any teaching that he did had to go from Burmese into Chinese. And in the public talks, every talk went for 2 or more hours because he would speak in Burmese and it would be translated into Chinese. But in the private sessions, nobody had any common language, but we all pretended. But I had already been to Wat Soan Mokkh by then, and so that's actually what did it for me. But I turned my bicycle around and I hopped back out of Malaysia, right back to Wat Suwan Mokk. Didn't leave for a while.

**Speaker B:** What did you get out of that, and how long were you there for?

**Speaker A:** In Malaysia at the Penang retreat?

**Speaker B:** No, Wat Suwan Mokk, or whatever you said.

**Speaker A:** What? Yeah, Wat Suwan Mokk. That's the home of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So he was your overall, I guess, main— I mean, you had many teachers, but he was your main, you could say, teacher that you felt the most closest to, or no?

**Speaker A:** I would say that it was a twin situation between he and Achan Po. Achan Po was the abbot of Wat Suan Mokkh. And that while Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was, let us say, devoted to the Thai culture, the Thai people, and getting the actual Dharma out to the public, as well as gaining many, many noble friends along the way from many different quarters, including all of the top Watts. But Achan Po was the one who was actually more interested in the foreign, the Westerners. So that was mostly my relationship Basically, Bhikkhu Buddhadasu was by appointment only, and Ajahn Po kept the appointment calendar.

**Speaker B:** So when we talk about, I guess, a concentrated mind versus unified mind, and, you know, beginning of this topic was starting off with Vipassana. And I just, I guess one downfall of me and my ignorance is just not, you could say, 100% trusting that technique, because so many people that have long experiences, time with that technique, were not satisfied. So I guess, could you talk a little bit about a concentrated mind versus unified mind? And yeah, I guess we can start there.

**Speaker A:** The unification of mind that's mentioned in the Eightfold Noble Path that is often, and in English, referred to as Right Noble Concentration. As far as I know about the word concentration, it misses the point, especially since if the guys who had done the translation had bothered to read more carefully, words like unification is associated with that. In fact, in Sutta 117 in the Great Forty, The Buddha talks about, 'Oh monks, listen, and I will give you right, noble unification of mind with its supports and requisites.' And that word unification was then translated into Samadhi, because actually what the word Samatha means is gathering things together, Or like the gable point at the top of a house, or an arch has an archstone, or that a teepee has all the tent poles tied together at one point. That's a Samadhi point. That's also what we mean by the Samatha of meditation called Jhana. It basically means not a concentrated mind, but it means gathering together the factors of first Jhana. And when the factors of first Jhana are gathered together, the mind is unified because it's applying intense— not intensely, but intentionally, and sustaining it intentionally. And what are we sustaining? Wholesome thoughts. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. One Dhamma thought after another. Dhamma is actually a good wholesome topic to talk about. If you and I start talking about politics, one or the other of us are going to start talking about some unwholesome stuff. So keeping the mind wholesome intentionally— so this is what we mean by the first Jhana. And when we add the other features like, say, sound, comfortable, secure, and satisfied. Now we have the extra ingredient of Sukkha. And Sukkha— safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied— is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha. It's exactly opposite in Pali. It's exactly opposite in Thai language, part of the Thai language. It's more of a surprise in Thai than it is in Gujarati, because Gujarati is a language, and I do know that, I've got a student whose parents speak Gujarati in the house, and they're using dukkha and sukha, actually dukkha and sukha, on a regular basis, as opposites. So knowing that, we can say, wait a minute, if we can put all of this kind of stuff together from Sutta 36, where the Buddha says is that indeed the first Jhana is the path to enlightenment. Why was I afraid of the pleasures of first Jhana? Because they're not sensual. That's the way. OK, why is that? Because when we are in fact the noble quest that the Buddha was on is the removal of Dukkha. And here he's reflecting upon that first Jhana has got that Sukkha. Let's get into a state of Sukkha. And when we get into that state and it's done with the Eightfold Noble Path point of Right Noble Waking Up, Right Noble Paying Attention to What's Going On, and Right Noble Changing. Effort to make a change, to make our thoughts wholesome. And we're constantly doing that over and over and over again. And then that feeling of safety and security, especially if our wholesome thoughts are everything is okay, there's no problem, there are no gorillas, there are no boogeymen, there's no work to do and no place to go and nothing to do. And so we begin to feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied, and everything is okay. But if we want something like enlightenment, if we want the bell to ring, now we're in a state of Dukkha because we want something we don't have. And so we have to remain free of those hindering thoughts of wanting something that we don't have, something of the past, something of the future, something that's not right here right now, or something annoying. These are the hindrances. Another one would be Doubt. What the heck am I doing here when I could be out on my bicycle? You know, those are the kind of thoughts that we have that prevent us from actually enjoying what we're doing right here, right now. Okay, so let's say that now we get this thing on a roll and it becomes a snowball and then an avalanche. And where the avalanche comes in is now the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path. And that is Samma Sanghappa. Samma Sanghappa is referred to— the wrong translation is thought, but you've also seen it translated as right noble intention. OK, there's another way of looking at it so that we begin to understand what is this Samma Sanghappa, right noble attitude. Right noble leaning. When I say attitude, we can either have this attitude of straight up or we can have this attitude. In which direction am I going to fall? If I'm leaning in that direction, I'm going to fall in that direction. If I'm not leaning, I'm not going to fall. Okay, so which way does the mind lean? If it is leaning in the direction of, oh no, something could go wrong, then guess what? Something will go wrong. And so those are the way that we begin to see that the attitude that we have and what the attitude that we're now actually intentionally developing as we're breathing in, we develop Piti. What that means is we're changing our attitude from the attitude of a loser into the attitude of a winner. I can do this. I can clean out the mind. Look at it, one wholesome thought after another, yippee-ki-yay, and now that elation is added to it in the sense of being a champion. The kind of feeling that the crowd buys very expensive tickets to a big expensive football game. Why? It's because when the guy runs down the field and makes a touchdown, what is the first thing he does? He cheers in the air, "Yay!" Why does he do that celebration? Guess what, everybody in the stands on his side, they do the same thing, that's why people go to the game, it's for that thrill of success. And so here we're beginning to see, I'm getting successful in my meditation, that's the Samma Sanghappa, I can do it. We've got success. This stuff works, and it works at a really deep level because not only does it work, whoever I was is no longer that. Something new is happening. A lion is born. Change of lineage. The winner, the strong one, real strength based extend wisdom comes up. This is that Piti, and a lot of people don't quite understand it. They think it's magical or mystical or.

**Speaker B:** All— You put that very well. I got that. You nailed the head on the hammer— nail, I should say.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** So, I mean, practicing everything you said in these techniques, is it possible to purify the mind where you literally you don't have any desire or lust for anything.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you're in a time frame. That's the clock you're in. You've got a measurement of time. The answer is, is that right now the answer is yes. And if you can do it this time, you can do it again. Get out of the future and stay in the present moment. Caught ya. Yeah, you're right. Don't worry about long-term purification. Get it going right now, because now will be the skill that you're developing that'll help that skill be there in the future for you if you can remember. So develop remembering too. And that's why we practice. This is the whole point of practice, the whole idea of getting into seclusion so we can only deal with our own issues and clean out the mind of all of these hindrances. And the second thing that we begin to do also is begin to make friends with all the dark corners, that we become friends with ourselves. We change our rule systems. This is what is referred to as Sila, Bhante, Paramasa, which is the second fetter of stop expecting things from yourself and relax and nourish yourself instead.

**Speaker B:** I have so much work to do. I'm so ignorant to so many things. I'm so ignorant to so many things, but it's okay.

**Speaker A:** No, that's the whole point. Look at what you're doing right now. You're saying, oh, poor me, I'm ignorant of all of this stuff. No, you're not. You just turn it, wake up, and say, I'm glad you told me that. Caught you again. That's Sati. That's the wake up and look at what you're doing. You can change that right now when you catch it. And when you do, catch it joyfully. Aha! Make a game out of it. This is fun. Or you can do it the misery way. Up to you. And so in a way, this is the practice that develops the Metta that you can have for your own inner being, whatever that is, because it ain't being, it's moving. So everything is a moving target. Nothing is what it used to be, so we got to keep watching. Everything's a moving target. Often these targets are colliding with each other. That's funny. Everything's a target for another target.

**Speaker B:** It just keeps going.

**Speaker A:** A lot of collisions happen that way. Sometimes they get really piled up, like on a freeway. So this is the way of practicing the Anapanasati that is based upon the Eightfold Noble Path. It's based upon back, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is often understood by Westerners the way that we get everything else, and that is delayed Gratification. You go to first grade, you learn ABCs. Why do I have to learn the ABCs? Not because I can have a chocolate ice cream right now, it's so I can learn to read. Well, why should I learn to read? So that you can become smart. So why should I want to be smart? And on and on and on it goes with delayed gratification. And so when we approach Buddhism, we see that it's delayed gratification, just like Christianity. That's delayed gratification. Gratification. You got to work like hell to avoid hell when you die. Everything is delayed gratification. So this practice is not delayed gratification. This practice is get your benefits right now. Dukkha, Nirodha. Hop right out of that Dukkha step 1, First Noble Truth into step 3 Noble Truth. Just step right over. Your choice. Jump that hurdle of all of the causations and land happily. You can be in the Third Noble Truth anytime you want to. All you have to do is remember Because we got a method. What is our method? Ah, to remember, to look at what you're doing, and to make a change. Then congratulate yourself.

**Speaker B:** Can you recommend any, um, books for sutra references, and then we could dig a little deeper?

**Speaker A:** For ourselves, or— I have been mentioning several today. Uh, number 117, 118, also you say which ones. No, I left that Yeah, all right. I haven't really talked so much about the hindrances, only a little bit. Uh, you can look also at Sutra Number 2, the first part of it, the Sabbha Asadha Sutra.

**Speaker B:** So what about actually like any books themselves, if any?

**Speaker A:** I would recommend Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. There's a lot of stuff that's translated into English. All you have to do is Google Buddhadasa and you can find all many things. ABC of Buddhism and Handbook to Mankind would be two that I would recommend. Okay.

**Speaker B:** You talked a little bit about this before, that you've seen many people, you know, are like, oh, I'm just going to renounce, and it's just a mess, everything from the culture to the food. You know that some people like, oh, I'm just going to go to Thailand, India, and do this thing. So does that— do you see that happen more often? Than not, I guess. And I guess, could you talk a little bit about not only that, but how you kind of made up your mind that you were just going to teach Dhamma and, you know, do nothing else? I mean, what inner insight, I guess, that you felt? I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, you got a lot of questions in there. Can you pare it down and get down to.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll just talk about you then. I guess that'll be a good question we can go to.

**Speaker A:** It's not.

**Speaker B:** I'm not— I noticed you don't really like that at all. You don't like to talk about— ask questions particularly about you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** I feel like there's something we can.

**Speaker A:** Gain out of it. No, there's actually— the point is, is that what value can you receive from this? And life stories don't help. Then what you really want to know is how can you practice correctly, and I've just told you that. And so if you do it right now, you wouldn't be asking stupid questions. Though I must admit that I'm also still curious about many of the early things that happened in Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's life, but I know that I wouldn't go to him to pester him about it because he'd been dead for 30.

**Speaker B:** Years. Fair enough. You still there? Oh, okay, he went out a little bit.

**Speaker A:** I said James is good at, um, dragging old stories out of people. But his role is different. He's an interviewer, and so I give him that. But mostly there's nothing to talk about.

**Speaker B:** So if you say—.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I said, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, don't do what I did, okay? Go find your own freaking path and take the Eightfold Noble Path along as a map to do it.

**Speaker B:** Fair enough, that's all I needed to know.

**Speaker A:** That actually happened with the Buddha. We still have many, many of the Westerners trying with very little success to duplicate what the Buddha did himself before he was enlightened, rather than doing what he suggested after he figured it all out. I think that we're like that even with our own family, our daddies. We would rather do as my daddy does and listen to what my daddy says.

**Speaker B:** This is a very good point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, monkey see, monkey do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure. And that's particularly why you don't talk about your personal, because that has nothing to do with what we're talking about right here, right now. Fair enough.

**Speaker A:** Old past story. So what I can give you is joy, enthusiasm, eagerness for the Dharma, delight in being alive, and a chuckle or two from some of my outlandish jokes. Sometimes I'll set them up for 5 minutes just waiting to get around to the punchline. But it's all about the Dharma, which means basically the word Dharma can mean actually anything and everything. And when you see the Dharma in that way of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha about everything, then you recognize, hey, everything's going to be all right, everything's going to be fine, there's nothing much to do about it. Whether the world is absolutely— whatever the world is— is absolutely full of shit or an absolute paradise, one way or the other, you can't do much of anything about it but choose how you feel. Looks like you chose the right one that time, rather than the other side of it. Oh, I don't know if I can do that. So every moment we have a choice. That's why we want to wake up to and be in the present moment, rather than locked in our old habits of the past, which are the hindrances to prevent us from being in the present moment. I mean, that's the Dhamma of the Buddha, is so succinct. Everything fits together so precisely, and yet to The way that we see it is that it's all— it's a list of things. There's 6 of these and 5 of those and 4 of them and 3 of that and 4 more of those things and 5 of this. Gosh, we got a lot of 5s and we got 7s and we got 8s and we got 12s and we got 16s and we got 32s and we got 108s. I mean, what a list of stuff, right? But all of those Those are kind of memory anchors of the various things that are just in this one book. You could just interrupt in this moment.

**Speaker B:** But it's nice.

**Speaker A:** Fair enough.

**Speaker B:** Well, I appreciate this talk very much. I'll even have to go back through it.

**Speaker A:** All right, when are you going to do your retreat?

**Speaker B:** Next month, so at the beginning of the month.

**Speaker A:** Oh, well, you have lots of time of practice before you go. Absolutely. Yeah, you can get ready for that, Joker, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you might want to give me a call between now and the time that you go to the retreat then. Okay, so go practice the way that I— I don't tell— I haven't told you where to sit, where to go, when to sit, or any of that kind of stuff, but I do recommend seclusion to practice these things, just remove those hindrances as soon as you catch them and to be on guard for it. That's the correct practice. And you can see that that's built right in there. But why isn't that emphasized by all of the main teachers?

**Speaker B:** It's a good point. And that's maybe why the reason you don't have— or that's why you stay away from that, specifically saying that. And I get it, which is probably the wise move to do, because if it, you know because then someone could push the blame on you. Oh, this is, you know, so I think you kind of been there, done that, like you say, and that's why you don't do that, which is wise. It makes sense. I get it.

**Speaker A:** All right, John, well, we'll see you soon. Fair enough.

**Speaker B:** I appreciate it so much. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Take care. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is as follows:

Dhammarato critiques several popular meditation techniques (Goenka, Mahasi noting, choiceless awareness) for a common, crucial omission: the active role of **Right Effort** from the Eightfold Path. He argues these methods often lack the imperative to *change* one's mental state in the present moment.

### Key Criticisms of Other Methods:
*   **Goenka/Vipassana:** Teaches observation but misses the step of **actively gladdening and controlling the mind**. It's like watching trash (unwholesome thoughts) without taking it out.
*   **Noting Practices:** Can lead to becoming proficient at noting mental "garbage" without purification, potentially leading to frustration or a "dark night of the soul."
*   **Choiceless Awareness/Do-Nothing:** Fails to emphasize that awakening requires **making a choice** to change *now*.

### The Core of Dhammarato's Teaching:
The practice is not a proprietary technique but a direct application of the Buddha's framework:

1.  **Sati (Mindfulness):** Remembering to **"wake up"** from being lost in thought (the 6th sense) and return to the present reality of the five senses.
2.  **Right View:** Using wisdom to look at what is happening in the mind.
3.  **Right Effort (The Missing Piece):** **Actively removing unwholesome thoughts and replacing them with wholesome ones.** This is the essential, often-omitted step. Any present thought can be improved.
4.  **Application to Ānāpānasati:** The breath is a tool for this active training. "Mindfully he breathes in long" includes:
    *   **Examining the mind's state** (tired, sharp, dull, distracted).
    *   **Gladdening the mind**, cultivating *sukha* (happiness/comfort born of safety and security).
    *   **Developing *pīti*** (joy/enthusiasm), the thrill of success in purifying the mind.

### The Goal: Jhana as a Unified, Wholesome Mind
*   **Right Concentration** is better understood as a **unification of mind**, not forced focus. It's the gathering of the factors of the first jhana: applied & sustained thought on a wholesome theme (*vitakka & vicāra*), accompanied by the joy (*pīti*) and happiness (*sukha*) developed through Right Effort.
*   This practice is **not delayed gratification**. The end of suffering (*dukkha nirodha*) is available **right now** by switching from an unwholesome state (1st Noble Truth) to a wholesome, joyful state (3rd Noble Truth) through mindful choice.

### Practical Advice:
*   **Make it a game:** Catch unwholesome thoughts and joyfully replace them.
*   **Cultivate satisfaction:** "How nice to have nothing to do and nowhere to go."
*   **The path is now:** Don't get lost in long-term purification goals; purify the mind in *this* moment. The skill built now will be available in the future.
*   **Resources:** Study suttas like **MN 19, MN 117, MN 118 (Ānāpānasati Sutta)**, and the works of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**.

In essence, Dhammarato emphasizes a dynamic, responsible, and joyful meditation practice where the meditator actively cultivates wholesome mental states through mindful choice, using the breath and the body as anchors in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several metaphors and stories to explain their points about meditation practice and the shortcomings of certain techniques. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **"The cart before the horse":** Used to criticize practices that treat *Metta* (loving-kindness) as a cause or technique for good practice, rather than as its natural result or effect.
2.  **"Picking through your own mental garbage":** Describes the potential futility of "noting" practices (like some Vipassana) where one observes thoughts without actively changing them, leading to rumination.
3.  **"Climbing the ladder" / "Noble Noodle Ladder":** Represents the progressive improvement of thoughts. Each moment is an opportunity to "climb a step" by replacing an unwholesome thought with a more wholesome one.
4.  **"Lost in space or lost in time":** Refers to being caught in mental concepts about the past, future, or distant places (like "Ukraine") instead of being present with the immediate reality of the five senses.
5.  **"Dark night of the soul":** A borrowed term (from St. John of the Cross) used to describe a painful, despairing phase that some meditators encounter in certain insight practices. The speaker argues this is unnecessary if one practices correctly from the start.
6.  **"Pyramid" of teachings:** The Buddha's teachings are structured like a pyramid: the pinnacle is *Dukkha* (suffering) and its cessation; the next layer is the Four Noble Truths; and supporting it are elements like the Eightfold Path and Dependent Origination.
7.  **"Gathering the tent poles" / "Archstone":** Explains *Samadhi* (often translated as concentration) not as intense focus, but as a **unification of mind**, like gathering tent poles at the top of a teepee or the keystone that holds an arch together. It's about bringing the factors of *Jhana* together.
8.  **"Snowball" and "Avalanche":** Represents the building momentum of positive practice. Wholesome thoughts and gladdening the mind start a "snowball" effect that can become an "avalanche" of positive change, linking to Right Intention (*Samma Sankappa*).
9.  **"Moving target":** Describes the nature of experience and the self—everything is in flux, constantly changing, so one must keep watching and adjusting.
10. **"Delayed gratification" vs. "Get your benefits right now":** Contrasts common religious frameworks (including how Buddhism is often misunderstood) with the speaker's core message. True practice offers immediate relief from *Dukkha* in the present moment, not a reward in a distant future.
11. **"Monkey see, monkey do":** Critiques students who try to slavishly imitate the Buddha's or a teacher's personal life story and arduous path, rather than following the effective **map** of the teachings (like the Eightfold Path) he laid out after his enlightenment.

### **Stories & Analogies:**

1.  **The Football Touchdown Celebration:** Used to explain *Piti* (joy/rapture). The player's triumphant "Yay!" and the crowd's shared thrill is an analogy for the joyful, champion-like feeling of success in meditation when one successfully cleanses the mind and has wholesome thoughts.
2.  **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Reference:** The speaker mentions that court-ordered AA often fails, but when a person "hits rock bottom" and realizes they are harming themselves, they become willing to change. This parallels the "dark night of the soul" moment in meditation, which the speaker sees as an unnecessary, painful catalyst for change that proper early instruction could avoid.
3.  **The Buddha's Reflection in Sutta 36:** Referenced (though not narrated in full) to support the argument. The Buddha asked himself why he was afraid of the pleasure of the first *Jhana*, realizing it was not a sensual pleasure but a wholesome one (*Sukkha*) that is the direct opposite of suffering (*Dukkha*) and is the path to enlightenment.

### **Core Narrative Framework:**
While not a single story, the speaker constructs a **contrast narrative** between:
*   **Incomplete/Flawed Techniques:** Practices like Goenka's Vipassana, Mahasi's noting, or "do-nothing" choiceless awareness are depicted as missing the crucial element of **Right Effort**—the active, moment-to-moment work of waking up (*Sati*), examining the mind with wisdom, and **choosing** to replace unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones to "gladden the mind."
*   **The Complete "Map":** The speaker presents the Buddha's teachings (specifically the Eightfold Path within *Anapanasati*) as the correct, complete system. This system is portrayed as a practical, immediate, and joyful path of taking control of one's mind, leading to unification (*Samadhi*) and the bliss of *Sukkha* **here and now**.

This contrast is the central story driving the entire dialogue.
