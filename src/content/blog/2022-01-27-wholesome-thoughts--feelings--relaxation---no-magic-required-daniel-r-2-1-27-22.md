### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello, Daniel. It's good to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** And that one of the things that you had just mentioned was that you were trying a lot of different practices or a lot of different meditations from this and that. Teaching and advice. Is that—

**Speaker B:** if you want the executive summary, I didn't, I didn't try that many things.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't.

**Speaker B:** I didn't shop around too much. Not too much.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I just did the breathing. I just read Daniel Ingram's book, the breathing, and then the Vipassana, the focus on body sensations. Those two, and that's pretty much it. So pretty simple.

**Speaker A:** Well, any instruction that starts, stays on, and ends with focus on or take an object of meditation, and this is the object that we present to you, go look at what we're talking about. Okay. Any book that does that is off track. A much better way of saying is that here, practice on this object of meditation, and when you get good at practicing on stability of the mind, we've got a whole bunch of stuff for you to look at. We've got the entire Satipatthana. We got body all over the body. We've got feelings all over the feelings. We got thoughts all over the thought world. And we've got ups and downs and backs and forth and starts and finishes and cessations and relinquishments and all of that kind of stuff. Are objects that are to be taken one at a time as they occur. And yet Western mentality gets focused on, oh, this meditation technique of focusing on this object is a different meditation technique than someone who is focusing on a different object. And because of that, they're in competition. And there's a story that Buddha teaches about this, and that is the story of the 10 blind men Fondling an elephant. Have you ever heard that story?

**Speaker B:** I believe you told it, that they all fondle a different part of the elephant, and then they all come away with a different interpretation. Is that correct?

**Speaker A:** That's Western Buddhism for you.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And I'm trying to introduce to you that the places that you've been feeling around is just part of the elephant. That exist.

**Speaker B:** So are you saying don't focus on one particular object? Are you saying like focus on everything?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not saying any one of those things. I'm saying in fact that we learn first to focus on objects, and then after we get really good at that— and the way that we would consider being good at that is by the hallmark or the roadmap markers of the first jhana. So once that you've gotten the mind into the first jhana using whatever focus or technique that you use to get into the first jhana, now we've got a whole list of things that we are going to be paying attention to, which is, or in fact now, the wholesome aspects of what we were doing in the first place to get into first jhana. Now, I know that that sounds humorous, but now that we're in the first jhana, we can see what is there, but we can see it with a wholesome, clear mind. Rather than seeing it flashing back and forth amongst all the unwholesome stuff. But there is stuff to be inspected, stuff to be investigated. And what are some of the items on the list? Is watching how you apply the mind to the object and then watching how you can sustain on the object no matter what. That in fact that's the applied and sustained, and that should be the object of the meditation and not the meditation object itself. The object of the meditation is, can you apply the mind to an object and keep it there? Ah, so what else is worth as an object? Another object is the object of how good we feel. How satisfied we are. In other words, we're talking about the object now of Sukkha. Taking the object of Sukkha means that we make sure that we're taking the object of there is nothing to fear here now. And then we take the object of, wow, how comfortable I am just sitting here, no place to go and nothing to do. And then we focus upon being satisfied and we start working with that satisfaction. And when we get that feeling of satisfaction, That's actually the aspect of the first jhana, especially since we've been focusing also on focusing on the object. In other words, back to the applied and sustained thought. And now we are actually having the object of sustaining the mind on pleasure and joy and satisfaction. Then we take other objects, and as we take other objects like Piti, and then equanimity, and then various aspects of the mind that are in the list of Piti, Samuppada, as well as other wholesome objects like the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. These are really worthy objects of focusing on rather than focusing a little bit and then having unwholesome thoughts coming around and dancing around and then a little bit more focusing on the Four Noble Truths. Now we can actually stay on the Four Noble Truths while we know that we're staying on the Four Noble Truths as an object. Okay, so then we can begin to notice the rising and falling of everything that we could notice. So the first, we begin to notice Anicca. Everything is in turmoil, everything is in flux. But we really have to stand back with a very, very stable mind to be able to see the dance that is reality. Because when we're in the dance, we can't see the dance routine very well. The dancers who were on the dance floor, on stage doing the dance, she's very much concerned, that dancer, with how she fits into the immediate little group that she's in. But it's only the audience that are sitting way back can see the show and how all of the girls in the dance line are actually in chorus with one another. That's why they call it a chorus line. All right. And so this is what we begin to do then, is we begin after we get very, very stable, is we begin to draw back so we can now begin to see all of the objects that we used to focus on one at a time. Now we can focus on them as kind of a group. And see how this whole show operates, how the mind works. Okay, so that's a little bit deeper part of the focus. But first we got to figure out what objects are worthy of paying attention to. Yeah, because before, in the time of the Buddha and while he was learning and practicing with various teachers, He was given all kinds of inappropriate, unuseful objects. But he did learn the skill of being able to focus on an object. All right. Basically, the objects that he took that were unworthy of his focus, but he gained the skill of focus anyway, were things like the kasinas, fire meditation, sky gazing, water gazing, actually the four elements, all and any of the four elements on the outside. And you turn that around, it says no, we need to focus on all of the elements, and any element will do, but we need to focus on eventually all of the elements on the inside. And so then the Kasina meditations become the body, and the water meditations become the feelings, and the fire meditation, that which consumes and burns things down, is the mind. And then the smoke that's left as the residue are the thoughts or the clouds. So these are the four aspects: the Kayanupassana, the Vedana, the Citta, and the Dhamma. But That's in a formalized order, but that is not necessarily the order of practice. It's the order of introduction. So Anapanasati is set up in that order to where the body comes first with the breathing and then the knowledge of the body and eventually the tranquility of the body. But that is not the order that is to be practiced because the body never will come to rest until the mind has already gotten quite a lot of rest. So long as the mind is doing this, the body is going to be doing some of that too. In order to get the body to rest, got to work on other aspects of Anapanasati too. There are other objects to take than just the body. But for some reason, Goenka's method has gotten settled on we're going to do Anapanasati step 3 until we rot here. And that's what they do. They do that body scanning when it's only just a little of your step 3 of a 16-step process. So, okay, okay, okay. So what would be a good chronological sequence then? Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, there is an actually quite, um, excellent, reasonable chronological sequence that are set up. And this is called the Seven Factors of Enlightenment in the Pali, it's the Sambhojana. And they have an order to them in the sense that it's going to build on one another. And the first one on the list of skills, and actually the way that we're referring to these is skills after they have been developed. So that now, as they have been developed, they are now factors of the awakening. They're not skills in development. The practice of Anapanasati is to get the skills into development, and we do Anapanasati then for the fulfillment of the Sambhojana.

**Speaker B:** Which is— what is the Sambhojana?

**Speaker A:** It are the 7 factors of enlightenment. I've got the list you, but not go into detail. Okay. Okay. So that you get the chronological order down and then we can see how that operates in the moment by moment. Okay. All right. So the first item on the list is unremitting mindfulness, unremitting Sati. Now, what this word unremitting actually means is we keep coming back, we keep coming back, we keep coming back. Most Western meditators say that, oh, we've got to stay there all the time. That unremitting mindfulness means that we're there all the time. And that's not going to be possible. No one can live their life like that, that we can't do it that way. That in fact, it's a practice of coming back and coming back and coming back until you're in a rhythm of coming back like a drum, a hammer, a mallet beats a drum. Okay, so many people think that mindfulness should be like this, but a drum and a mallet don't do the drum and the mallet's work. But the mallet, if it comes back and hits and hits and hits and hits and hits, kind of in a rhythm, unremitting, back and forth, over and over again, almost like in a cycle. Now we have a rhythm going. So that's unremitting mindfulness. And with unremitting Sati comes next is the unremitting investigation. You look at what the mind is doing.

**Speaker B:** So the unremitting— sorry, could you explain again?

**Speaker A:** Investigation is the word that you missed.

**Speaker B:** Unremitting.

**Speaker A:** Unremitting investigation. Unremitting looking. Unremitting watching. Unremitting inspection. The unremitting of Watch the show, look at what's happening, look at what you're doing.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point of it, is to remember to look at what's going on. That's what we mean by the investigation. Unremitting investigation can only happen with unremitting Sati. You can see the connection. And as we gain the skill, our right efforts wind up being unremitting energy. In other words, we can still keep going. We gain persistence, we gain that regularity and that rhythm in it. And so it's actually, we can call this enthusiasm. Unremitting enthusiasm is how, is how our, what used to be unremitting, are actually just effort. Effort then becomes right effort, and as it becomes right effort, it becomes unremitting right effort. And as it becomes unremitting right effort, it becomes unremitting enthusiasm. We keep coming back and coming back enthusiastically. All right, and so that's something that we can put in there. That's number 3. Number 4 on the list is unremitting piti sukha. And then after that is unremitting relaxation, and that should take us far enough for the moment. In fact, that unremitting relaxation, that fifth item on the list, is in fact step 4 of Anapanasati, to relax the body. And when it becomes an enlightenment factor is that we can relax and keep relaxing and keep relaxing, and any tension that comes up we can just relax again. Because we're watching what's going on with the body and the feelings and the mind, but we have to take each one individually as an object. Okay, so now that we've got the Seven Factors of Enlightenment at least as a clue, now we can look at the Eightfold Noble Path itself, because there the source of those Seven Factors of Enlightenment is stated right there in the path. Or the method that we're using or practicing. That is, right noble Sati is to remember to wake up and take a look. And if we continue to practice waking up so that we can take a look, and waking up and waking up and waking up, it will someday become unremitting.

**Speaker B:** Meaning relentless. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Relentless. That's another word for it. It's relentless.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** It will not let go, but in the sense of being chased relentlessly rather than being caught and imprisoned relentlessly. This is not like this. It keeps coming. It's repeating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it just keeps happening.

**Speaker A:** Keep happening over and over and over again because we've been practicing that rhythm of having it happen over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Repetition, by the way, is one of the most important teaching techniques for this, so that the students get into the point that, oh, this is not can I do it really well, it's that can I keep doing it good enough every time over and over and over and over and over again. That that's the sequence, is to just get good enough to be able to keep doing it over and over again and stop trying to get it right. Or doing it good enough so that I don't have to keep doing it. No, the skill is to develop it so that we keep doing it over and over and over again, but we've got the energy and the effort to do that because that's also the skill. Okay, so back to the Eightfold Noble Path then. Right Noble Sati, to wake up and see what the mind is doing right now. With the discrimination of, is this a wholesome thought or not? Next thing we do— that, by the way, would be related to Step 9 of Anapanasati, of investigating the mind, and also on the Eightfold Noble Path as right view or right viewing, also on the, uh, Seven Factors of Enlightenment is investigation and remaining in investigation. So when we do that investigation, what that means is we're doing it with discrimination and determination about what's the difference between is this thought worth having or not? Does this thought make scratch, or is this thought unwholesome? Is this thought worth having? That's the question. Is this thought worth having or not?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and if it's not worth having, then we throw it out and change the mind to having something that's worthwhile having a thought about. So if we're having an object of relaxation, then we want to make sure that the thoughts that we're having are relaxing thoughts, not thoughts that keep us unrelaxed. Okay. Okay, so as we are developing this unremitting investigation and unremitting effort, now developing that, we take the right effort to throw that thought out and replace it with some wholesome thought. As we do that, this is step 10 of Anapanasati, called gladdening the mind. And as we're gladdening the mind, basically we're having wholesome thoughts, and those wholesome thoughts now are saying things things like, everything is okay, everything is fine, no worries, no problems, everything is okay. Wow, I don't need anything at all, I'm completely satisfied. These are the kind of thoughts that we begin to develop, and then we experience that the body is following along. We literally start talking ourselves into feeling good, because we've just spent our whole lives talking ourselves into feeling bad and not knowing what thoughts made us feel good and which ones made us feel bad. Now we're going to make that choice. Is this thought going to make me— if I keep thinking about this, is that going to make me feel good and satisfied? Or is this thought, if I keep having that kind of thought, like maybe sending an email to the boss 99% of the time, sending an email to the boss is not going to give you good feelings. But it is possible that you're going to spring a great big surprise on the boss and give him something very happy. Then you're very happy and excited to write that email.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So now that we know that writing emails is not the point, it's how do we feel about writing the emails. And so if you think about writing an email that's going to be trouble, and you want to get it over with, then that means that go write it and get it over with instead of sitting here thinking about it and feeling bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Instead, we mindfully wake up. I'm not at the computer. I don't have that email. I'm not writing it right now. I'm not going to think about it because while I'm thinking about it, I feel bad. I'm not going to feel bad. I'm going, well, I don't have to think about that email right now. Isn't that marvelous? I don't have to think about it. I can think about something that's nice that's happening actually right now. Okay, so now we begin to actually do the relaxation, which is actually the Vedana of coming out of unsatisfactory feelings like fear, regret, anger, remorse, guilt. You know the routine. You've had all of those feelings. Okay, sure. And when you feel that, you don't especially want to feel that, but you do feel that way because of the thoughts and the circumstances and all of that. Well, now we can say I can change my thoughts and therefore change my circumstances. So now I can tell myself thoughts that make me feel safe, and secure and comfortable and satisfied and even successful at being satisfied. Okay. And so these are the thoughts that we're going to start having. Our thoughts are wholesome. Thoughts about there is no dangers here. Thoughts about this chair is comfortable enough, my tush is comfortable enough. My knees are comfortable enough. Everything is okay. No problems, no worries. I'm comfortable enough. And now I can be satisfied that I'm comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is a good banana.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, do you ever— yeah, well, this breath is a good banana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or if you're eating a banana, I mean.

**Speaker A:** Anything that makes you feel good, whatever you're doing, whatever you're doing, you have a choice about how you feel about it. And this is a marvelous wake-up for anyone to recognize that you do have control over how you feel. And the way you control how you feel is by what you're thinking, and what you're thinking is controlled by your attitude.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so if you clean up your attitude, then you'll clean up your thinking, and then that will clean up your feelings, giving you a sense of whoopee, of joy. Wow, what a relief this is! I can do this! That's the feeling that we're looking for, that feeling of satisfaction and joy. That's the Piti, Sukkha. And so now that we have that state of, wow, I could do this, Now I can look at how I'm doing it. What's the factors and the features of how I'm getting this done? I'm putting a whole package together moment by moment. Wholesome thoughts lead to wholesome feelings. Wholesome feelings lead to wholesome relaxation of the body.

**Speaker B:** So that's kind of the investigation aspect of it, right? There's mindfulness, which is just noticing And then investigating what you're doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, remember to notice. The investigation is the noticing.

**Speaker B:** So what's the difference between the— sorry,

**Speaker A:** but noticing is not enough. That's where the Mahayana method stops. They don't continue to the next step of the Eightfold Noble Path, and that is to make a change, the right effort to change what's in the mind. Otherwise, we just notice and notice Dukkha, and there it is, and we notice it again, and there it is again, and we notice Dukkha again, and there it is again. And that's our meditation. Yeah, shake our own tail. No, we've got to make a change. We got to notice that that stuff is unwholesome and change it to something wholesome. That's the point. But we've got to remember to keep doing this.

**Speaker B:** Over and over and over, over and

**Speaker A:** over and over and over again. So we need to have a kind of Sati that's unremitting. It does it over and over and over again, this little cycle of waking up, look at what you're thinking, and change it to something more wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** that's a little cycle that we go through, not just one object. It's a whole bunch of stuff that we've got to put together, little tiny micro steps. Actually, you say there are 4 steps that we have to keep doing over and over and over again, and it happens immediately. What are they? Remember to look and to change and to feel satisfied about it.

**Speaker B:** Remember to feel good.

**Speaker A:** Remember to feel good. Basically is exactly it in the shorthand, or just don't worry, be happy. And that's even a shorter way of saying it. Stop worrying. Don't worry, be happy. Or as the Buddha would say, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker B:** What's that?

**Speaker A:** Well, Dukkha is suffering. You see this? Anapanasati. Yeah, that's a pretty heavy-duty word. A better word, the actual meaning is unsatisfying, unsatisfactory, not quite good enough.

**Speaker B:** Not quite good enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it comes out of judgmental thoughts. Uh-huh. And it gives you the feeling— because anytime that you are judging things as to good or bad, anything that you judge as good has got something else that's bad. You're creating a duality. And create that duality, about half the time you're going to wind up on that which you don't like. Yeah, but if you stop making that duality by stop judging things and just say this, whatever it is, is okay, is completely different than that critical mind that we have of making judgment calls and then feeling bad about them, setting rules we can't follow. Then we have thoughts like, oh, this is too hard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or there I go again. Or wow, this meditation stuff is hard. Those are just unwholesome thoughts. So we catch those thoughts and we change them to wholesome thoughts. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So this might be what you consider like an irrelevant question, maybe.

**Speaker A:** All questions are irrelevant.

**Speaker B:** Fair enough. So what was the issue with the fire casinos and all that? What was the problem with that?

**Speaker A:** Uh, when somebody comes out of whatever state that they're in because they did a fire meditation, or the same guy that they were when they went into the fire It's not curative the way that this process is, because this is something we're doing on the inside. In that practice, it's assumed that the fire is doing some of the work or all of the work.

**Speaker B:** I was watching your talk with Daniel Ingram, and you said it doesn't matter how— about fire kasina. It doesn't matter how deep you go into the meditation. Because if you don't do the right things when you get there, it's a waste of time. And once you get out, if you don't do the right things, it's a waste of time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just said that, right? It's using different sentence structures, but again, it's the same point, right? Expecting the prior meditation to do something for us, as opposed to using whatever state that we've got in with the prior meditation in order to see what's going on. So if we just start seeing what's going on, then the prior meditation itself was irrelevant,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Oh, and back to the little snicker about all questions are irrelevant. Yeah, sure. All questions are because there's some doubt in the mind, and doubt is a hindrance to the practice. So not only are questions irrelevant, they're actually harmful. While the mind is questioning, it's not investigating, it's questioning, it's mulling, it's trying to fit old data together to try to make sense out of the past. Yeah, if we stop doing that and stop asking questions and just be here now and watch what's going on, we don't have any questions, we are not full of doubt, we can actually clean the mind and have wholesome thoughts instead.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** now that doesn't mean that I don't answer questions, and in fact that just gives me an opportunity to yabber on, and I like doing that. But that's only what questions are. When you don't have any questions, you're satisfied. When you do have questions, you're dissatisfied. Notice that too. And so the answer to that then is we don't need to know everything. We just need to know enough right now to feel satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So any questions about how do I practice meditation are actually irrelevant. Not just irrelevant, but questions about how do I practice or what object do I take of meditation, that is a hindrance. And we should see that as a hindrance so that we say, I don't have to figure out what to do. I could just sit here and relax. And by doing that you're doing actually the right object of meditation, is by seeing that I don't have to figure out what meditation to do. I could just sit and relax, which is the meditation.

**Speaker B:** And it sounds like you're kind of saying that you basically don't have to do strict sit-down meditation unless that's something that you want to do that makes you feel good. Right.

**Speaker A:** And it does have the aspect of skill development.

**Speaker B:** Sit-down meditation does.

**Speaker A:** If you're doing the sit-down meditation correctly. But 90% of the time that people do sit-down meditations, they're not getting any more out of it than people who are doing sit-down casino meditations or fire meditations.

**Speaker B:** So how do you do it correctly?

**Speaker A:** Well, gosh, what have we been talking about for the past 30 minutes? And that is that you really look at what's going on and make a choice and throw the unwholesome stuff out of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And bring joy in. Don't expect the fire casino to make you joyful. Expect that you're going to make yourself joyful with or without the fire glowing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's skillful. That's skillful.

**Speaker A:** That's the skills, right? That's the skillful way of doing it, is to remove the unwholesome thoughts and replace them with wholesome thoughts, which means the skill is the skill of recognizing whether a thought is wholesome or not. Because a lot of students will say, well, how do I know what's a skillful thought and what's an unwholesome skillful thought? And the answer to that is determining it as skillful or unskillful is a skill to be developed. And as you examine thoughts more and more and examining the same thought-feel-thought-feel-thought-feel complex, you begin to recognize that a whole lot of thoughts that you used to thought would be okay to have, now you recognize that they too are unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and then when they arise, you can just throw them out.

**Speaker A:** Just throw them out and come back to a wholesome thought. It really is that easy.

**Speaker B:** So I guess, so when it comes to all these techniques Could you— would you say these techniques are like a base to practice that? No, no.

**Speaker A:** Here's a way of looking at it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Looking at it like this, that the teachings of the Buddha, the entire Buddha Dharma, including the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, The Triple Gem, the Triratna, Paticcasamuppada, Anapanasati, the Eightfold Noble Path, all of that stuff is in a mosaic or a jigsaw puzzle. And that Buddhism is delivered in the West as a great big box full of mosaic tiles with instructions, or it's a jigsaw puzzle It's been broken apart and 500 or 1,000 pieces are sitting there in the box. And all you've got is a picture of the puzzle on the outside.

**Speaker B:** That's Western Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** That's— well, that's all of Buddhism. But the point about Western Buddhism is, is that the jigsaw puzzle these guys are putting together, they haven't gotten the whole puzzle put together yet. It's got— well, they've got a few pieces. But they've got a few pieces missing. That's the point. Some of the pieces are missing. And when you see the whole package, you recognize, oh, this is just one little thing. Yeah, it's easy peasy. I've got it. I understand it. But people will take bits and pieces and features of it. So back to the elephant. This is what we're talking about, is that, yeah, Western Buddhism is a whole bunch of Western people fondling Buddhism in a little area and think that they understand the whole show. I mean, some people fondle a part of the elephant and come away thinking, hey, in order to be a Buddha, you got to have balls. But since most people don't investigate that very well, they don't even understand that, yeah, that rogue elephant's got balls. And that's where the quality of the Buddha comes in. You know, the Buddha was known as a lion. He was also known as a bull. And in this case, it's not a bull like a cow, it's a bull like a bull elephant.

**Speaker B:** Would you say he was like a monkey?

**Speaker A:** No, I would say like he was the biggest gorilla in the tree. Okay, whatever tree.

**Speaker B:** Like he was really tough, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, remember that he was a prince.

**Speaker B:** He was a warrior prince.

**Speaker A:** He was a warrior prince, exactly. He was skilled in all the martial arts. He knew archery, he knew elephant training, he knew horse training, he knew all of that. When he left the castle, if it was a castle, I think it was just a wooden barn that he lived in, but we've got him prince-like to have castles. He carried a groom, or he took a groom and a horse with him. Jhana was the name of his groom. He gave the horse freedom and Jhana stayed with him.

**Speaker B:** Didn't he have a kid and he named it Saddha?

**Speaker A:** That was later. We'll talk about Rahula at a later time. Okay, okay, okay. No, we're talking about that there were great success stories, that he was on top of his world when he left. And when he went out into his spiritual practice, he could meet or exceed anything that any teacher gave him to do. And then he would leave because he felt that too was unsatisfactory. But he developed a huge number of skills along the way, and he sat down and he figured out that, hey, there is something to some of these practices, but the real issue is that we've got to see the crap in our mind and throw it out. That's the real major change that the Buddha said. That's the real path, is we've got to make a change. When As soon as we see it. When do we see it? As soon as we remember to look.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's not in 50 years.

**Speaker A:** Right now, right now, right now, right now. Look at it right now. This is it. Look at what you're doing. And when you look and look and look and see and see and see and know and know and know, those eloquent testicles start to grow. Because you know that you know, and you know that what you're saying is correct, and you've got great backup. You've got backup from your lineage, from your own teachers. You got backup from the Sangha that you're in and the other monks around. You've got backup from the suttas. You know that you know, and you've got good backup, solid, full-on evidence that you know what you're saying is correct. Only then Can you actually have the confidence to teach the Dharma? That's what real point about one of the talks with Dan and I was.

**Speaker B:** You were talking about like who can teach the authentic Dharma, right?

**Speaker A:** Who can teach the authentic Dharma? Anybody can teach the authentic Dharma. These dogs teach authentic Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** The question is, is are you going to be the lion of the Buddha that can teach the Dharma?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, who really knows the actual correct way of practice. And you know that you know the correct way of practice. And so that's what my job is, to instill in you that confidence that you know that you're practicing correctly, and then you don't have any questions.

**Speaker B:** That would be good. That would be good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, so just drop the questions and see and know. Huh,

**Speaker B:** that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, these questions are an irrelevancy, not a relevancy in just like, there it is, I bet we don't care, ignoring it, but rather no, questions are a rat hole.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. While the mind is questioning, it's not satisfied right then and there.

**Speaker B:** You think that's like 100% any questioning is dissatisfaction?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, and it's your job to know that this question is unsatisfying. Uh, so that maybe you can see and do something about that. Like, one thing is, is that I don't know, and I can't find the answer to that now, so why should I think about it? I can drop that question because I don't have the answer, and we drop it. Or do we have to invent something and try to say, oh, if I think and figure in and worry long enough, I might be able to dream up an answer?

**Speaker B:** No, just gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a lot of work. No, I can do without it. I don't need that. I have enough information right now to practice correctly. Okay. And so we begin then to develop the skill of being satisfied, because questioning is developing the skill of being satisfied, hoping that answers will make us satisfied. No, questioning just gives us a habit of more questioning and more questioning. And yeah, we get a little satisfaction when we get this answer, but then we've got more questions. When are we going to change that whole system into learning to be satisfied without the answers? Yeah, yeah. Hey, I don't have to know whether George Bush or, um, Arnold Palmer are going to win the presidency. I don't care. Not my problem.

**Speaker B:** That's everybody with the, uh, with the Google now. Everybody's addicted to information, you know. Everybody's got to look everything up. My whole family, everybody.

**Speaker A:** Well, we were talked at in a prison that you call grammar school or primary school.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a skill, but it's used unwisely because we're not taught how to use that skill. And so you wind up having a whole society full of people that want to know and want to get get it and are still dissatisfied and want more. Or a bunch of— stop with all that. Yeah, yeah. When are you going to just start learning to be satisfied? Give yourself the pie that you won. You did win the teddy bear at the, uh, crapshoot at the fair. Take your teddy bear and hug it and go home. Be satisfied with what we got. That's the idea.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's good to be— it's good to learn things though, right?

**Speaker A:** It's good to like— ah, but how do we learn things? We don't learn things by questioning. We learn things by observing. Bang, I got you that one. Yeah, yeah. And while we're questioning, we're generally not learning. That when a student has got a question on his mind while I'm talking, that question on his mind will prevent him from hearing the answer to it while I'm telling him before he asks the question. But he's got the question on his mind, so he doesn't even hear the answer to the question. Because he's too busy having questions rather than open to the answers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So in that regard, questions. Now another one would be, um, Before we make a choice or before we take an action, we don't have enough information to act upon yet. Can we happily ask questions, gather more information so we know where to go, what to do? Which I do all the time. I ask students a lot of questions because I'm looking for information on how to deal with them in the moment rather than trying to make up something and taking off with that, which I like to do also. So there is use and value for questions, but not while you're sitting in the meditation hall, right, with the intention of practicing meditation, right, right, right.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of like, uh are similar to questioning. Questioning is a skill, or finding information is a skill. Just like if someone were to body scan 24 hours a day, or like, or like focus on their breathing all the time—

**Speaker A:** can't be done, nobody does.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, yeah, but you know what I'm saying, like Right.

**Speaker A:** You're using Western language that has eternalism built right into the language with every and always and pure and perfect. I mean, our vocabulary is just riddled with impossibilities. So instead of saying he's watching his breath all the time or she's scanning her body all the time, why don't you say that? Yeah. She's been scanning her body. She's scanning. Okay, so now you've got somebody body scanning. That doesn't mean they're going to do it forever. How is she going to, while she's body scanning, stand up, walk out of the meditation hall to lunch, fill her bowl full of food while she's in the line, and then sit down and eat the food? She can't do any of that if she's fully intent on watching body scans.

**Speaker B:** But what do you— I'm not saying, I'm not talking about people doing it all day. That's impossible. I agree.

**Speaker A:** That's what you just said.

**Speaker B:** No, I misspoke. I misspoke then.

**Speaker A:** I listened. That's the whole point.

**Speaker B:** What I'm asking is, what do you think of people who who just follow these techniques and make progress, if they're not doing Anapanasati or throwing things out, they're not doing that practice?

**Speaker A:** That's the question. Are they making progress? And what is progress according to what standards? I know of people who have lived in meditation retreat facilities, first paying a lot of money to get in and then stayed after their time. But I don't know if they're making what progress or not until I can see. Basically, this is something interesting. When I was very, very young, there was a joke about how does a child learn to repair a bicycle? How does he learn to use the pliers? How does he learn to use the screwdriver? That kind of thing. Okay, and the answer is always is that you got to hold your mouth right, in the sense of screwing up, you know. You got to get really into it. You got to really hold your mouth right to get that thing done. Okay, so in the meditation hall, the only way to do meditation, you got to learn to hold your mouth right. In a great big grin. But in order to hold the mouth right, you got to hold the mind right in a great big grin. And in order to keep just the grin on your face, you have to have the whole body devoted to that grin. So the whole body is sitting there grinning, the whole feeling is sitting there grinning, the, um, uh, the whole mind is sitting there grinning, and the thoughts that we're having are grinning thoughts. And that's when we're actually in a wholesome state that the Buddha would call Samma Arya Samatha, or right organization of mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So when you're talking about only the body scanning or only on the breathing, I'm talking about— no, we're talking about a state of mind.

**Speaker B:** Anagami.

**Speaker A:** And that state of mind has the quality of a grin.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps even a snicker, but a grin will do.

**Speaker B:** I try grinning when I sit down to meditate, and, uh, I can't, I can't hold it too long. Like, my my muscles get tired.

**Speaker A:** But notice that you haven't been developing the muscles of smiling and grinning. And also, when you're doing it consciously, watch whether you're holding the smile, which puts tension into it. An example of that is hold your hand out and hold it still. If you held your hand out and hold it still, it will become tense. It will start to waver. You begin to see, yeah, your attention is growing. I'm not holding my hand still, I'm relaxing my hand. Uh, the intention is relaxing rather than holding. Relax your grin. Okay. Wow. I just relax. Relax the grin too, rather than holding the grin. And also notice that the tension comes, and then the tiredness comes, which means that the tiredness is showing that you haven't exercised the muscles of grinning very much, that you haven't been to the gym of grin. And when you practice grinning a whole lot, it becomes really easy to do it for a while without getting tired, especially when you're doing it relaxed rather than doing it holding an intention.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's the key to not just the grand, that's also the key to holding the mind, is stop trying to hold it, just let it relax. Stop trying to hold the body still. Just let the body relax.

**Speaker B:** There's this guy on YouTube who posts like 4-hour or 8-hour videos of himself just sitting in the lotus position, smiling, like big grin, just without moving for 4 hours.

**Speaker A:** Okay. How confident are you that those videos have been edited before they were uploaded? It's all raw footage.

**Speaker B:** No, so he livestreams them, you know, and he's done like hundreds and hundreds of videos, and there's like a lot

**Speaker A:** of different— Here's a question for you. How many people sit right along with him happily versus how many people see that and get jealous?

**Speaker B:** I don't think people do either, because it's not— he's like, I don't think he's talked about much in meditation or Buddhist circles. He's more of a performance artist.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, sure.

**Speaker B:** There's one episode where his apartment gets robbed, like, while he's in the middle of it. And he stays in position, he stays smiling and sitting.

**Speaker A:** I can do that too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So after you have the skill, then it may be also useful to have the wisdom to know when to apply the skill and not. Be honest with you, I was once kicked out of an apartment.

**Speaker B:** What for?

**Speaker A:** Because I was just sitting there when the landlord came in. Freaked him out.

**Speaker B:** Did you pay rent?

**Speaker A:** He wasn't there for the rent.

**Speaker B:** But were you paying the rent?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that wasn't the issue.

**Speaker B:** So he just didn't like that you were sitting?

**Speaker A:** He didn't like that. It freaked him out that I was in a state of meditation such that I was not about to move just because he was in the room. I wasn't paying attention to him. And I was unwise. I should have paid attention to this dude. He got right in my face trying to figure out what was going on, and I just sat there grinning at him. Didn't move much of a muscle at all.

**Speaker B:** Did you notice him?

**Speaker A:** Sure, I noticed him. I know he's there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, people don't go that out of it. I didn't die. I just didn't move. And like I said, that was a very unwise thing to do because I could prove that I could.

**Speaker B:** To yourself or to him?

**Speaker A:** Well, I didn't have an object. I don't remember at that time. It was a long time ago, way back in the 1970s. Arya developed those kind of skills. I mean, there's nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what's— I've been interested in that, like the strong determination sitting, people who sit for hours and hours. What's with that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what's with that?

**Speaker B:** I heard the story about a guy who would just like sit like that for 12 hours and then go take a pee. And then sit like that for another 12 hours.

**Speaker A:** I know, I've seen him. Yeah, yeah, well, there's a lot of them. They, uh, I've seen them, uh, in, in Burma. For some reason, they all tend to go to Burma to do that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, he might have been Burmese. If there were visitors to the temple, he would, he would like help them out, or if someone needed help, but other than that, he would just sit.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's how I live too.

**Speaker B:** That's what you do?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just sit here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but you're talking to me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you're like a visitor who came to the village, and so— or to the temple, and so I'm taking care of you. Yeah, I take care of my students.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but if I weren't here, would you just be sitting?

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know. I'd sit a lot, doing nothing, just enjoying. No practice.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** No practice needed, no skills needed. You just— wow, what a beautiful morning! No place to go, nothing to do. But it's a skill to be developed.

**Speaker B:** And the skill is what?

**Speaker A:** Well, there's a whole actually set of skills, and like I said, the important one is the wisdom of knowing when to put some skills together. In other words, Sati, to look up, wake up, look at what's going on so that you can deal with it wholesomely. And when you wake up and there's nothing going on, you can say, hot dog, I could do this. Nothing happening. Nothing going on but me and the kookaburra.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** there he is again. I hear a motorbike and some noise. Voices in the distance. Yeah, there's just nothing happening. Hear the car and the cuckoo door again. Now the dog just rolled over, so now she's actually completely covering the top of my right foot. Now she's licking my left foot.

**Speaker B:** Oh, nice.

**Speaker A:** And there's nothing to do and no place to go. I don't have to move a foot.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** So that's the place to come to by practicing going there often for a short period of time, and then the mind wanders away. Never mind, come back and just sit. Everything's all right. Anything that comes to mind can be changed or thrown out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but you see that there's a lot of different little skills built into that. Then in fact, the skill of Sati, uh, right investigation, right effort, and right attitude are only the foundation for the skill of getting into the first Jhana. And so the next skill is the skill of being able to maintain the first Jhana. And only after those skills are fully developed can you develop the third skill, which is the proper way of coming out of the first Jhana, because almost always the way for people to come out of the first Jhana is by crash landing. Back into their hindrances that they would say is ordinary reality, rather than the reality that exists that we can create in our own mind. So these are a whole bunch of the skills that we're talking about. The ability, as we're speaking about this, is the ability to just sit. But by him just sitting, he's not doing much of any good. For anybody. I mean, the camera that's focused on him is not getting any value out of it. YouTube itself is not getting any value out of it. The question is, who are the watchers of the videos? Are they getting anything out of value? Is he giving inspiration? Is he giving a right attitude? Hey, you can just sit here like me.

**Speaker B:** I think so.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think, uh, see, I'm asking a lot of questions about it because I don't know. I don't see any value much. I mean, how long are people going to sit if he said— if you say that he will sit for 8 hours, how many people are going to sit and watch him sit for 8 hours?

**Speaker B:** Not probably very, very much.

**Speaker A:** But they're going to be doing a whole lot of clicking fast forward or down to the next, uh, 10 seconds or whatever like that over and over again, and maybe spend maybe 30 minutes at best watching 8 hours of video, maybe putting it at double speed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** there's all kinds of things that people will do with a video where nothing is happening. People are looking for action.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's not much action. There's one where his apartment gets robbed and then they leave because they just see him sitting there and they're like, what's going on? And they get scared and leave, kind of like what happened with you. And then there's one where— there's one where— there's one where he— his like girlfriend broke up with him or something. So like 3 hours in, he starts sobbing really violently. He starts crying and he's still smiling.

**Speaker A:** So he's not just sitting there. Yeah, he's not just Piti.

**Speaker B:** Well, of course not, of course not. He's just some guy.

**Speaker A:** He's got girlfriend on his mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then there's one where he had to— I'd say that's interesting. It's good that he had the courage to publish that video to show that all he's doing is just demonstrating strong determination. He's not demonstrating that he's just sitting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a strong determination thing, for sure. Yeah, it's all about that.

**Speaker A:** I know, I've been there, done that.

**Speaker B:** So you think that's useless?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's got tension built into it because of the strong determination. You want to go back to the example of the hand, of holding oneself still. Yeah, that tension built right in rather than just relaxing. And if you're just relaxing, then are you keeping a timer on how long are you relaxed, or are you just going to relax?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually, that kind of happens lately when I sit down. Like, I'll do 10 minutes, and I followed your advice. I've been doing like several 10-minute bursts, right, throughout the day. And that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I like that.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but sometimes getting benefit out of it, that's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead and say yes. The yes but coming.

**Speaker B:** But, but, but, sometimes after the 10 minutes, I hear the timer go off and I'm like still into it, so I just sit down for another 5, 10 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I stay sitting. Got nothing to do with timers then, does it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, forget about the timer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Right. But you do have to sit down and practice correctly long enough to get yourself into a really good state. And then the question is, is that why should I get out of this simply because some timer went off?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That was set in the past.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It was just a machine doing its job. Why is it now my boss?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, then in fact the timer might be broken and didn't go off for 8 hours.

**Speaker B:** I don't think I'm there yet.

**Speaker A:** What you're saying now is that you trust your clock more than you do your own mind.

**Speaker B:** Am I? Is that what I'm saying?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, think about it.

**Speaker B:** No, that's the opposite. I'm saying sometimes the timer goes off and I stay meditating.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So I go by my own mind, not the timer.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay, fine. But when you set the timer, What thought did you have?

**Speaker B:** Well, when I set the timer, I want to make sure I sit down for long enough.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** That's important too.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, then why don't you sit until you feel like that it's long enough instead of thinking, oh, it's going to take 10 minutes in advance? So this is the next point. You don't need a 10-minute timer. You need to sit down and stay there long enough practicing correctly until you get yourself into a really, really good state. And then why leave?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And practice that now 6 or 7 times a day because you won't be able to stay in it long. Your hindrances in the form of what you call reality will have its own timer to set. Someone will come into the room to rob you, or thoughts of the girlfriend will come up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or you have to go pee.

**Speaker A:** I gotta go pee, right? So we have to take care of things. The question is now, can I get up happily and go take a pee happily, and then come sit back down happily and maintain that first Jhana during the pee process. Really standing in front of that urinal, ah, that feels so good. Ah, what a relief it is to let go.

**Speaker B:** I do notice ever since I started meditation sitting down formally Every little things feel better. I can get that, like little things, more gratification, more fulfillment in small things, fuller experience.

**Speaker A:** You're seeing more things, and the more you see, the more satisfied you get. But the more we think, the more dissatisfied we get.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So looking instead of talking is the right way to go, especially if we're looking at the talking.

**Speaker B:** Do you know what the toku system is?

**Speaker A:** Are you talking about where the monks go up the hill with a bag full of goodies looking for a young kid that they see promising and then give him the bag of goodies, and when he plays with one, we say, oh, he must be this Rinpoche or that Rinpoche? Is that the toku system you're talking about? Where they talk the mothers into giving up their kids, that the mom's not about to give her kid to that monk until she's told that this— your child is special enough, now give him to us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, like the Dalai Lama, isn't he basically a Toku, or is he different?

**Speaker A:** No, he is actually renouncing the Toku system.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. He was brought up in it, but like being brought up with Leadbetter, Krishnamurti actually excommunicated himself from the Theosophists. So the Dalai Lama has excommunicated himself from the Toku.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** you don't know about the story of Krishnamurti?

**Speaker B:** No, I— Never mind.

**Speaker A:** Well, he's dead now. It doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** J. Krishnamurti?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the old one from the 1880s.

**Speaker B:** The Indian guy?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** I know about him, but I don't know his story.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. Well, we don't have to go into it then. No, never mind, because we've got the example of the Dalai Lama, who is, by the way, a good friend of my teacher Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker B:** Wait, have you seen that video? Krishnamurti was Toku system?

**Speaker A:** No, no, Krishnamurti's got nothing to do with it. He was a different example of someone renouncing the lineage that they had been trained in.

**Speaker B:** Oh, what was he trained in?

**Speaker A:** The opposite. With Colonel Alcott and Leadbetter and Madame Blomsky, Transcendentalism, that whole stuff about the 1880s. That was a Buddhism that came to the West. But let's not go into that. It's not important.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, that's fine.

**Speaker A:** Okay. What is important is that when systems find themselves not working anymore, then those who are somewhat to do with those systems, if they're wise, they'll make a change, rather than keep doing the same old thing over and over again. Well, what happened was, is that the punching Lama was pinched. By the Chinese and that they intend to, when this Dalai Lama dies, they're going to come up with their own Dalai Lama. And this Dalai Lama knows that and says, we got to put a stop to this, otherwise there's going to be two of them competing for who wants what. So he says, I'm not coming back. I'm not. I'm not going to give the Chinese an opportunity to try to take over our religion by coming up with a kid that they've got trained to take my place. Remember that the Dalai Lama sees Bhikkhu Buddhadasa— this is on the video— is that the Dalai Lama sees Bhikkhu Buddhadasa as his elder brother in the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, I knew about that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's it. In other words, the Dalai Lama knows about rebirth. He's just not out there harping on how harmful the belief system is. The way that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is talking, well, since the 1930s, 100 years now, how harmful belief in reincarnation actually is. It's harmful.

**Speaker B:** Why is it harmful?

**Speaker A:** Because if people say, get the idea, oh, that means I'll have a better life next time, then they won't bother to do anything about it right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And by the way, all of reincarnation that has been labeled rebirth by Buddhists, but in fact it's just the same old belief. In fact, I could challenge you by saying I bet you don't even know the difference between rebirth and reincarnation. So I'll just use the word reincarnation. That's what the belief is. They can dust it up, pedal it off, paint it white, and call it rebirth. But it's the same old belief system that the deep, dark past has something to do with the present moment, and the deep, dark future controls your life now, or that what you're doing now will control the deep, dark future. And neither one of those things are correct. The Buddha says not only get out of the deep, dark past, get out of the immediate dark past. But if he says, "Be here now," then 10 years ago is irrelevant, 15 years ago is irrelevant, 15 lives ago is even more irrelevant.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, this present moment, let's live in this present moment, let's stop with these silly beliefs about Dukkha, that it's a really good way for the old monks in Tibet to get fresh young meat. To train correctly. But that system's falling apart, doesn't work anymore. Let's go find young monks some other way, where we don't have to deal with the fact that the Chinese are up to our stick. The Chinese are on to it, and they're about to abuse it. The only way to change it is by changing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, change the system.

**Speaker A:** Change the system. Let's not have Toku. We don't need it. We don't need the Chinese to appoint the next Dalai Lama.

**Speaker B:** And that would be bad why? Because it's just their puppet, basically.

**Speaker A:** Well, it would be their puppet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, the Chinese government's puppet.

**Speaker A:** Right, right now the present current Dalai Lama is nobody's puppet, right?

**Speaker B:** The Dalai Lama is just his own thing.

**Speaker A:** Remember the elephant story? He's got his own

**Speaker B:** set of balls.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. So that's one of the things that people are so impressed about with the Dalai Lama is he's got cojones.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the Chinese cannot run him.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. They can't do it. So they want the next Dalai Lama to be under their thumb. And this guy with the cojones says, hey man, these cojones are not coming back. They're not returning. Not with a Chinese painted job. And I know because I've seen some of the comments on that talk about, uh, the tulkku system. Which one? Well, uh, the Guru Viking stuff.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that the comments are that people really hate me when I expose that stuff.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. They can't stand it. You say, oh, you don't know anything about the Tukkha system because we believe that those trinkets that the guy played— well, here's one of the examples of that, that there was one of the Tukkha monks who went around in his teenage years saying, oh, I remember that piece of furniture and I remember that piece of furniture. And this guy walking around pointing out that this furniture that this kid is remembering that he had in his past life, we know the manufacturer of that furniture and when it was manufactured, and the facts don't meet. That he's making this stuff up. This piece of furniture is far newer than what he's claiming it to be.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, guess what? That happened with me also, with a tree. Because I absolutely have the memory of my grandfather planting this big pecan tree. It's big now when we're talking about it, but I remember him planting it. And my mother pointed out that, no, you weren't even born when that pecan tree was planted. I know because I was a teenage girl at the time. And I had no argument with her. Because I can't prove it one way or another, but I had to trust that, yeah, she knew what was going on because she was a teenager and all I remember is an early memory of my grandfather planting a tree, it must have been this tree. And my mom says no. Exactly the same story. If we begin to recognize we cannot trust our own memory, that we need to go back and do a new investigation or drop the topic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's irrelevant.

**Speaker A:** It's irrelevant. The toku system is irrelevant. Drop it. You don't need it. The Dalai Lama thinks the same. We can drop that one. We don't need it now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. You know, some kid from Germany, his dream his whole life was to go be a monk in Tibet, and he got to go do it when he was like 15. So that's better than the tulkku. Find some enthusiastic youngster, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, precisely. And some of those old wise Thoku Tibetan monks will somewhere whisper in his ear, "I remember who you are," and off they go down that Thoku rabbit hole again, only this time you've got an enthusiastic teen who will really buy the trip.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then he'll live up to it happily. Or delusionally, his choice.

**Speaker B:** I think it's a good working assumption that it's just a delusion because it's just unprovable, doesn't help anything. It just doesn't help. That's the bottom line.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that true about all magical powers and all magical beliefs? Anything that cannot be demonstrated within the next 5 to 10 minutes Yeah. And is considered now irrelevant in your life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Like mystical experiences, magical powers, all that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Or even the corner bank in town.

**Speaker B:** What do you mean?

**Speaker A:** I mean, you think about going to the bank, but you're sitting at home and that bank doesn't exist here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's just a magical bank. It's not real until I walk into it or I approach it in the car. Until then, it doesn't exist. And if we can see magical powers that way, that yeah, when I get to the magical power, I'll inspect and investigate thoroughly. But until that magical power presents itself into my reality, I'm not going to bother with it, because what I'm bothering with is my own delusion, not reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Or if it's gone forever, there's no point in dwelling on it.

**Speaker A:** No, no point. And yet that's the whole point that the Buddha is trying to teach about greed as the reason for Dukkha. That's the Second Noble Truth, that the things that we want. So if someone is practicing Anapanasati for the intention of getting magical powers, he's going to be thoroughly and completely and continually over and over again disappointed because he's not getting the magical powers that he wants. And if you stop wanting things and just relax, he would begin to develop some skills that would turn up being power. He can develop the skills that gains power, but so long as he wants magical power and going to fire casinos and all kinds of stuff like that, He's not going to get anything other than just more wanting. Yeah, he might in fact turn into a charlatan and start telling people that he can do what he wants to do and make some money off of it. They call him a spiritualist,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Palm readers. Yeah, tarot card reader, been there, done that. Made some money off of it too. Made some people feel really good and got some money, but I stopped doing it because I was a charlatan and I could see that it was a charlatan.

**Speaker B:** But what about a Dan Ingram type dude who's like so into the magical power and all the concentration and maps and all that stuff?

**Speaker A:** See clearly what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Can he?

**Speaker A:** Will he look? Can he remember to look?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** yeah. A better question that I would ask is, is he a happy dude? He always presents himself that way to me. I get along with Dan really great. I don't care what he's into or what he wants.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he seems pretty happy.

**Speaker A:** When he's with me, he doesn't want anything. Yeah, yeah. So I don't know what Dan wants. I don't care. But in fact, I have had students insist that I listen to their story when their story is irrelevant. Yeah, it's just hindrances. They think that their story is special,

**Speaker B:** or that you listening to their story is going to somehow help, right? Change, or change what you have to say to them, right? Yeah, I mean, I could go on about all my, all my random, you know, out-of-body experience, mystical experience, all that stuff. But I do see that there's no point. It's not going to help anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because all you're going to get from me with any of that is, yeah, I've been there, done that too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It was actually, it was like mostly this year that all that kind of stuff, or not this year. 2021, all that stuff happened to me, and it was very distracting, very distracting. And it took me a while to just kind of like move past it and just forget about it.

**Speaker A:** Well, in some cases, for some people, that moving past and through all of that stuff is very long and slow, right? And that's when they give themselves a dark night of the soul, because they still really want

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's still the wanting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and some of us could just get over that. Finally, I don't have to want any of that stuff. I can be happy without it. I can be powerful without it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Or, you know, Shinzen Young, maybe.

**Speaker A:** I've heard the name.

**Speaker B:** He says that's one of the common traps on the path to enlightenment, is the trap of the powers, the realm of the powers.

**Speaker A:** People get— In a way, you could say that's the trap that most people start off already in, because isn't magical powers and rebirth and reincarnation deeply interrelated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, they're deeply interrelated in the sense of how valuable, how powerful, how real, and all of that kind of stuff are. But in fact, they're just the same thing— delusional thinking. Yeah, wanting something we don't have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like the

**Speaker A:** Satisfied with when I don't have it and be completely satisfied. And then if it ever comes along, I'll be satisfied when it comes, because my habit is satisfaction with what's real. Yeah, but people who want it are going to be dissatisfied until it comes, and they may, uh, dissatisfied until the cow come home.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. All that stuff is fringe.

**Speaker A:** Random.

**Speaker B:** It's not quantifiable.

**Speaker A:** You can't— it's hindrance. Hindrance is hindrance, wanting something you don't have. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking, um, you know how you said reincarnation is like, oppresses people because they're told like, oh, you don't need to worry about this life, next life will be better. It's kind of the same thing with Christianity, that this life is a big pilgrimage. It doesn't— you have to suffer through this life to get to like, uh, heaven, you know. It's like similar.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** So it's like the same thing to

**Speaker A:** suffer to get to heaven. Heaven will be the reward for you.

**Speaker B:** Heaven will come later.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So now here's an interesting thing, that if they are practicing being miserable then when they get to heaven, won't they continue to practice being miserable even when they're in heaven? Well, the suffering's not going to go away because the suffering is the habit of the mind. We don't need the heaven to feel good. Then in fact, most people are living in a paradise and they don't know it, and so they feel bad. I mean, the same thing happened to Adam and Eve. There they were in paradise, and what they started to do, they started complain. Yeah, that's what eating of the fruit of the, of the, uh, the Tree of Good and Evil is all about, is they started to seeing things as evil, they started to complain, and they destroyed their own paradise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Tree of Knowledge.

**Speaker A:** Fruit of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

**Speaker B:** Knowledge of Good and Evil.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yes, the knowledge of good and evil, or right and wrong, or bad and good, or magical powers versus no powers and Duality. The duality. Yeah, we destroy our paradise with duality. And in this case, the duality is I don't have magical powers and I want magical powers. The duality is magical powers versus no magical powers. And I'm saying I can be happy with and without it. And the other guys are saying I cannot be happy without it. That is the trap that people start off in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And many of them never get out of that trap. What is the trap? The trap of wanting someone else to do the work that we need to do for ourselves. Matt— oh, I cannot save myself, but if I had magical powers, then my magical powers would save me. If I had a plastic Jesus riding upon the dashboard of my truck, then that plastic Jesus will keep my car from making a crash, or my truck from crashing. But if I don't have the plastic Jesus, the car is just going to crash right into the tree, and then I can say the tree bit my car. That tree jumped right out in the road and bit my car. But that wouldn't have happened if I'd had a plastic Jesus riding on the dashboard. That's magical thinking, and we spend quite a lot of time in magical thinking, and we wind up being disappointed generally.

**Speaker B:** Magical or superstitious?

**Speaker A:** Superstitious is another word for it.

**Speaker B:** Religious. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the way that I say that is, is that I'm stitious but I'm not superstitious.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Let's be stitious. Let's look. Let's investigate. Let's see what's going on here.

**Speaker B:** But not superstitious.

**Speaker A:** Not superstitious. Superstitious means that I'll just believe anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Another trap this guy says is the map trap. He says people get too obsessed with maps and progress and all this stuff.

**Speaker A:** That's still living in the past and

**Speaker B:** the future, so that's a hindrance. Okay.

**Speaker A:** In fact, some maps are quite good and quite valuable.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** If you don't have a map of a town, it's hard to get around. If you have a map of the town, you can get around, but you cannot rely solely on the map because the map is old and the town is always new. So the new potholes and the new roadblocks and the new traffic jams, they're not on the map. The map is not the territory, but a map can be a good guide to the territory. What happens with meditators is they start living the map and stop living in reality. Okay, that's in fact what we're doing. And often when we say, wow, this meditation is hard to do, well, wow, this is hard to do is just an old map that the student has in his mind. He goes around saying, wow, a lot of things are hard to do. That's his habit. Of just making everything hard, not following the reality. Because the reality is this is dirt easy. All I have to do is set that map down, take a deep breath, and enjoy the moment. But as long as I'm holding and clinging to that map, the map says this is hard work. Meditation's a struggle. You got to strive, boy. Got to put in wrong kind of effort, and I mean super wrong. See, those are the thoughts that we have which prevent us from just being happy. That's following the map.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you got to put in wrong effort.

**Speaker A:** Well, I was giving an example of how hard you have to work. That's part of that map that we can put down. Reality is, is that it's easy. The map says it is hard work.

**Speaker B:** But would you say there's an element of failure? Like, absolutely, you fail over and over.

**Speaker A:** Well, it doesn't matter how often we fail in order to get the victim's attitude. We kind of start off with the victim's attitude. We are born born as a victim. Every infant is not able to take care of itself. The question is, as we grow up, will we ever come out of our victim's attitude or our victim's mentality that everything is hard, everything is brand new, it's tough? And every child begins to see life as hardwood, tough. Parents are there to slap us around when we don't do what we're told to do, all kinds of things. Yeah, but reality is, is now you don't have to live in that map. You can create a new map. Life is easy peasy. I don't have any parents to slap me around. Haha. I don't have to do things right according to them anymore. I could change my map. The maps we developed when we were a child, and we developed those maps ignorantly. So now we can look at what's going on, see reality in the moment. Stop playing— stop following the old maps. Stop playing the old tapes. Buddha has the word Shiva Bhanta Paramasa. Attachments to rights, rules, and rituals is what we're talking about. Like meditation is hard, that's an old rule. But it's hard is an even older, more basic rule, and all we tacked on to it was meditation. Changing a tire is hard work the first time you do it. It is. But if you change tires for a living, you can change a tire in 15 seconds. Nothing to it. Got all the skills and all the tools you need. So you see, it's an attitude that we have to build as a skill. And when that attitude is fully blown, it's those kahunas that we were talking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The attitude of I can do this,

**Speaker B:** Anicca.

**Speaker A:** I can do anything I want to do, and I don't want to do anything, therefore I'm very good at doing nothing at all.

**Speaker B:** That's something, uh, Like, you kind of see a lot of, like, people in this community talk about, like, oh, what if I awaken, or whatever? What if I awaken and, and, like, what, what will I do after I awaken? Like, will I just do nothing?

**Speaker A:** What do you have to do after you go back to sleep? You wake up. And what do you do after you wake up? You go back to sleep.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that marvelous? Wake, sleep, wake, sleep, wake, sleep. You do that cycle every day, sometimes twice or three times a day. So if we can do that in actuality, we can also do that metaphorically, or let us say virtually or mentally, to wake up, and then wake up, and then wake up, and keep waking up unremittingly, keep waking up. You're still in that Western mentality of once you woke up, you're always woke up, and that's that forever stuff again. Rather than everything is in cycles, nothing is steady, nothing is still, everything is in turmoil. Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So what's the difference between rebirth and reincarnation?

**Speaker A:** There's nothing to it in the sense that with reincarnation there's something to it. In the rebirth, there's nothing to it. In reincarnation, something is reincarnated. What is it that's reincarnated?

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Ah, in rebirth, rebirth happens, but there's nothing that is rebirthed. There's nothing to be reborn. What is born is something new. It's not the same old thing that was before. Something new that's born. And it's reborn. And every time that something is reborn, something new is born. With reincarnation, though, it's the same old thing that's reborn. What is it that's the same old thing? What is it that's reborn? What is it that's reincarnated? Which means, what is it that when death happened, it didn't die?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it just got reincarnated.

**Speaker A:** I mean, the Christians have a word for this. What is it?

**Speaker B:** Resurrection?

**Speaker A:** No, it's called the soul.

**Speaker B:** Oh, the soul.

**Speaker A:** And the Buddha just admits we got no soul. There's nothing to it. There is nothing more there in the body than the body. There is no person or soul in there. There's nothing in the feelings Just the feelings. There is no soul, no you in those feelings, because they keep changing. There is no you in your mind or in your memory or in your processing ability. Which I mean by that, consciousness, Samsara or Samskara, and Sangha or Namarupa. In other words, it's just perception, but you are not the perception. There is just your memories, but you are not those memories. They're just memories in a human mind, and you are not the mind. But whatever you are, you can see the mind. But when you see the mind, now you see it as not you. Most people, when they see the mind, they think it's my mind, it's me, these are my thoughts, I am these thoughts. And in our language, we even go so far as to use it like that, like I am angry, when the reality is, is there is anger to be seen. No, it's my anger. I'm angry, I'm tired, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, they say. And it's always about I, me, and minds. And so it's the I, the me, and the mind that is reincarnated. But really, there's nothing to the I's, the me's, and the mind. They don't really exist. They're temporary. They come up, they go down, they come up and they go down. And guess what? When they come up again, it's not exactly the same one as it was that died before. It's a different one now. You're different than you were when you were 5 years old. You're not the same. Yeah, yeah, you don't have the same thoughts or feelings or worries or cares or anything. All of that stuff has changed. So why do we get the idea that I'm the same person that I was when I was 5 years old, when in fact there's nothing about you? Not one hair, not one freckle, not one wart, not one drop of water, not one molecule of anything is the same. Everything is new, everything has change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So how can I possibly say I'm the same as I was 5 years old, or worse still, 5 centuries ago? That's the belief in a soul. A belief in a soul is that it is everlasting and unchanging. Anyone who has that attitude has the attitude, I can't change. I've got to wait till the next life. Maybe circumstances will be better. Maybe I can find a heaven and then I'll feel good, rather than, no, I've got to create that heaven. So that's the difference. One group is waiting on something on the outside to fix their broken little red wagon, where the really good child, or the playful child, or, or whatever, is going to be happy fixing and playing with his broken little red wagon. He doesn't need anybody to come fix it. Okay, so that's— this now is the main teaching of the Buddha in the sense of the Ten Fetters. This is the first one, personality view. Who are you is the question that people wrongly ask, that who am I is in fact an irrelevant question. What we need to see instead is what is Dukkha and how can it be avoided? Because every time there is Dukkha, that's where the self exists. The self is the one who experiences the Dukkha as being unsatisfactory. That's the self. And so when we stop being dissatisfied, then we stop being selfish, and then we're not being reborn in that or another kind of selfishness. But that's what being reborn is— selfishness. And when we're not born as selfish, that means that now we begin to understand this first better. This personality view is, I can change. I'm not the same. I do have the ability to change. And it's up to me to change. So the next question is, am I up to the task? Can I do it? But the very first question that everybody has to ask is, who the heck am I going to get to fix my broken little red wagon? Because I can't do it by myself. I need magical powers. I need a plastic Jesus. I need a guru.

**Speaker B:** I gotta get enlightened.

**Speaker A:** I gotta get enlightened, right? When I get enlightened, then I can be happy, rather than recognizing that when I am happy, I'm already light, and when I don't have what I want, I'm heavy. And what am I heavy with? The things that I want that I don't have, and they burden me down. And so personality view, rightly seen, is, hey, I can change, and I can change in this moment. I do not have to continue thinking these unwholesome thoughts. We can change those thoughts if those thoughts are not managed by some everlasting soul within. So that's the difference between rebirth and reincarnation. And another one is, is that rebirth can happen anytime, and reincarnation is a great big deal, requires moms and dads and doing things in the bed and babies getting born and all kinds of stuff. But rebirth, that happens in this system, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, second to second.

**Speaker A:** Second to second. Well, no, not that fast. Let us say tenth of a second to tenth of a second. It generally takes about half a second to go from everything is okay into what the hell.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** But it does take less time to do it than it does to talk about it. Talking about it takes 10 to 15 seconds. Having that cycle happen is about the same time they— in fact, they use in the sutras that it takes the time for a strong man with good limbs to stretch his arm. It takes that long, about a half second. There it is. That's how long it takes to go from heaven to hell. But guess what? It only takes that same half second to come back out of hell and get to heaven again. You can die to that hell. So, and you just let everything die, just, oh, there it goes, nothing to it. But I don't need anything to be happy, and I can practice that so that I can— no matter what it is that I want, I could stop wanting it long enough to recognize I don't need it. Yeah. And when you recognize for sure, over and over again, that you don't need it, then you gain the confidence, hey, I can handle anything. Hey, I can handle anything. I could throw anything, any rubbish at all that comes into my mind, I can throw it right back out. Including when you're in front of a policeman having a thought, this cop is dangerous, I could throw that thought out and put this cop's my friend. Yeah, and instead, and imagine the differences the way that cop's going to treat me between being afraid of him and me being friendly with him. So I create my own reality with the thoughts that I have. And when we know that we can make that change, then we can handle anything. Yeah, any cop that, you know, any police officer dressed or otherwise, welcome on my porch. He can come with handcuffs and warrants if he wants to. I can handle that. And if he brings a big shikshooter and shoots me, I can handle dying. Yeah, yeah, I can handle that. I can, I can die happily.

**Speaker B:** I think if, uh, someone came and pulled a gun on me and like was going to actually kill me, I think I'd be scared. I'd be scared. Realistically, realistically, you know.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, that's because you're telling yourself that you don't have the skills to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you're already in unwholesome thoughts. Why don't you tell yourself instead that, hey, I can handle that?

**Speaker B:** Well, I'd have no choice but to handle it, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, that's right. So you can either handle it badly when we're talking about it, or you can plan now. Oh, when somebody pulls a gun on me and is about to shoot me, I'm not going to be afraid. I can handle that. I can hand him my wallet.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, hand him my wallet, no problem, right?

**Speaker A:** But no, you're afraid of the gun.

**Speaker B:** I'm afraid of the gun. Yeah, I'm afraid

**Speaker A:** of the gun. So can't you just hand him the wallet without being afraid of the gun?

**Speaker B:** I can hand him the wallet because I think if I do that, he's not going to shoot. But I'm afraid if— if you do

**Speaker A:** hand him the wallet— in fact, if you fight with him, you live while you're fighting. But if you give him the wallet now, he'll shoot you now and you're dead. Better to fight, stay alive a little while longer. Me, I'm ready to go. I'm not going to fight with him.

**Speaker B:** That's my, that's my dad's attitude. He's like, really, like, if anything bad happens to me, like, like, I'm ready to go, you know, if we're in some sort of terrible situation, I'll sacrifice myself willingly, you know, or if I get like, like cancer, like stage 4 or something really bad like that, some terminal illness, don't try to keep me alive.

**Speaker A:** About that one. Why would you bother eating yourself alive to the point that it's step 4 of eating yourself alive? That's what cancer really is, is eating yourself alive. Just like a heart attack is when your heart attacks you. Yeah, but if you have the right attitude, you're more or less immune from cancer, figuratively or literally. Both, in the sense that— but it takes wisdom or knowledge. For instance, if you know that asbestos in the lungs irritates the lungs and causes cancer, then that means that you're going to be very careful around asbestos. Yeah, maybe even quit the job that you have where you're handling asbestos for some company.

**Speaker B:** Right, that way you don't get cancer.

**Speaker A:** That way you don't get cancer. And when you go around saying, "Hey, I'm going to keep my life safe, I'm not going to be handling things that cause me to eat myself alive." And so, we don't take medicines because a lot of medicines have carcinogens in them. I mean, some medicines even have little babies in them. I mean, that's what they call it, the anti-abortionists tell you. I'm just pulling your leg now.

**Speaker B:** Wait, what medicine has little— has babies in it?

**Speaker A:** All of them. What? Yeah, all of them. I mean, they call it biological research and they take dead babies out of mothers' wombs and make medicine out of it. That's what the— and that's one of the major problems that the Christians have. Is they don't want to take the medicine because the medicines are made out of dead babies that were aborted.

**Speaker B:** But that's not true.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what they say.

**Speaker B:** You can't listen to those wacky people.

**Speaker A:** But everybody's out there being wacky one way or the other.

**Speaker B:** That's true. I'm pretty wacky.

**Speaker A:** No, we need to take— keep our eyes open and watch for sure. And know the background of each medication that we're taking, to know what it does and what the research behind it is and all of that kind of stuff. So getting information about medications is a whole lot different than just being afraid of something because it's got dead babies in it. Why do you know that? Because people on the street corner that just came out of the church have signs saying that your medicine has babies in it. I mean, this is common. They call it what, stem cell research? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that shit.

**Speaker B:** Speaking of Christians, let me run this by you, okay? So like, what do you think of the attitude that life is super precious? Like, let's say someone is in horrible pain.

**Speaker A:** No, let's say that this life, this moment for you is precious. Why aren't you appreciating the preciousness of this particular moment right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but what if someone has like a horrible disease and like they're suffering immensely, like horrible pain, horrible pain? Should we just let them die, or is it like we should just make sure we try our hardest to keep them alive?

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe we should teach them how to stop seeing their reality is painful. The word pain is a mental word and not a physical reality. The physical reality is a sharp sensation, a dull sensation, a throbbing sensation, many different kinds of sensations that we have. A tingling sensation. Maybe you can define it even as an itching sensation.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, but that's what I mean.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, is a mental word.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but what if someone's in like

**Speaker A:** a ton of physical pain? Like how I feel. Okay, so let's talk about then that we're sick and we don't like being sick.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like what if someone's in physical pain from being sick?

**Speaker A:** You know, okay, well, why don't we just lay there and lay still, recognizing in fact neck pain, that if I've got neck pain and I know that the neck pain is there, I can just hold my neck still. And in fact, I could even go to the hospital and get an appliance to hold my neck still. But I don't need to go to the hospital to get an appliance to hold my neck still. I can do that with my own mind by just making sure that I'm holding my neck still. Rather than moving my neck, causing pain, and then not liking it and saying, "Oh, I got to do something about this, I got to go to the doctor." Right? But if you listen to the sensations of the body and do what the sensations of the body are asking, then you're treating that situation wisely. But most people, they don't train to handle sensations wisely. They want to get rid of them instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** My dad used to— yeah, yeah. So look at the mindset that you're coming from. That mindset is just a mental mindset that people work themselves into. All my pain is so bad, I need help, and I want you to kill me because I can't stand the pain. Well, now the same thing happens whether that child has a physical pain, let us say in the neck or in the back or somewhere in the kidneys or something like that, as opposed to the emotional pain of the bully's prick on her every day. Both of them wanting out. Both of them sometimes wanting out bad enough that they'll kill themselves. One because of the pain of the bullies picking on her, and the other one, the pain in the neck. Yeah, yeah. What is pain for you that's going to prevent you from taking the next breath? Because that's when you die. You die when you stop breathing. Yeah, yeah. So can you breathe through this pain, this sharp sensation that you're having in this moment? Can you take a deep breath and survive that one sharp pain?

**Speaker B:** If yes, then you are alive.

**Speaker A:** Then yes, you're alive. And if no, then you die.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that the pain is too much for me to bother to take the next breath. That's exactly, by the way, the whole point of crucifixion. Imagine, there you are, nailed or wired up to the cross. Yeah, with all the weight hanging down, the crown of thorns, crown of thorns, and it's hard to breathe. Yeah, why is it hard to breathe? Because the way that you're stressed out puts pressure, downward pressure on the breathing.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you can't breathe.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Especially when you're hanging like that, in order to release it. In fact, that's why the people have their nails or their feet nailed, or they have a little platform to stand up, so that they can stand up, take some pressure off their arms, so that they can take a breath. But eventually it's going to be too much work to take that next breath. Time to go. I've had enough. So you have to hang there on the cross for 7 days struggling with the breath, or can you do it in 3 days and just say, hey, I'm out of here? Okay, okay. How long are you going to cling? When are you going to let go? How much struggle are you going to put into the breathing? Yeah, those are the kind of questions that we will eventually have to ask ourselves. Hold on one second. One moment.

**Speaker B:** Good call. Yeah, yeah. All right, that pretty much answers my question.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm glad to see that we're ending this on a smile.

**Speaker B:** Of course, always.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, this has been a good chat, Daniel. I've really enjoyed having an opportunity to share the Dharma, which also means that we have to look and listen to the kind of language that we use, because often we're using unwholesome language because we learned it from the culture, and we can use wholesome language instead.

**Speaker B:** Unwholesome, like, like forever. Or eternal.

**Speaker A:** Big, hard.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or we can use wholesome language.

**Speaker B:** Or bad or good.

**Speaker A:** Bad and good, rather than everything's okay, everything's fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** So pay attention now. You've got quite a lot of reading between the ears to do. Remember to watch closely now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got, I got work tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** No, you don't. That's just another thought.

**Speaker B:** I got a job.

**Speaker A:** No, not right now. To go to tomorrow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** But you don't have to think about it now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm just saying.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know. That's what the point that I'm making, that you said, yeah, you're thinking about going to work tomorrow.

**Speaker B:** It's not an unpleasant thing.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's going to destroy our conversation. Why? Because you're leaving and I'm going to cry.

**Speaker B:** I'm leaving anyway.

**Speaker A:** I'm leaving anyway. Okay, that's right. You could leave without a reason. Whether you've got a job tomorrow or not, it's okay to leave. Just leave on a high note.

**Speaker B:** This whole call was a high note. It's a constant high.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, Daniel. We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, a conversation between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Daniel (Speaker B), centers on correcting common misunderstandings in Western Buddhist practice and outlining a practical, moment-to-moment path based on the Buddha's core teachings.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Critique: The "Blind Men and the Elephant" Problem
Dhammarato begins by critiquing the common Western approach to meditation, which he compares to the parable of blind men fondling different parts of an elephant and mistaking it for the whole. He argues that focusing on isolated techniques (like *only* breath or *only* body scanning) is like grasping just one part. True practice is a comprehensive process, not a single "technique."

### The Correct Sequence: From Stability to Investigation
The talk outlines a proper developmental sequence:
1.  **First, Develop Stability (Jhana):** The initial goal isn't to investigate everything at once. First, use a simple object (like the breath) to develop a stable, concentrated, and joyful mind—the state of the first **jhana**. This stability is the foundation.
2.  **Then, Investigate Skillfully:** Once the mind is stable and joyful (*piti-sukha*), you can begin to investigate (*dhamma vicaya*) other "objects" with clarity. These objects aren't just physical sensations but include:
    *   The quality of your focus itself (application and sustained attention).
    *   Feelings of pleasure, satisfaction, and joy (*sukha*).
    *   The factors of the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths themselves.
    *   The rising and falling (*anicca*) of all phenomena, which can be seen clearly only from a place of mental stability.

### The Heart of Practice: The Unremitting Cycle
The essence of practice is presented as a relentless, moment-to-moment cycle of four micro-skills, aligned with the **Seven Factors of Enlightenment** (*Sambhojjhanga*) and the **Eightfold Path**:
1.  **Unremitting Mindfulness (Sati):** Relentlessly "waking up" and remembering to look at what the mind is doing *right now*. This is not about constant perfection, but a rhythmic "coming back."
2.  **Unremitting Investigation:** Looking to see if the current thought or mental state is **wholesome** (leading to peace, joy, relaxation) or **unwholesome** (leading to fear, tension, dissatisfaction).
3.  **Unremitting Right Effort:** Actively discarding unwholesome thoughts and **replacing them with wholesome ones**. This is the crucial, often missed step. You don't just note suffering (*dukkha*); you change the thought that creates it.
4.  **Cultivating Satisfaction:** Deliberately fostering thoughts of safety, comfort, and "enough-ness" ("I'm comfortable enough," "No worries," "Everything is okay"). This generates the joy (*piti-sukha*) that fuels the cycle.

This cycle—**look, assess, change, feel good**—is the core practice, applicable both on and off the cushion.

### Key Corrections and Insights
*   **Against "Eternalist" Language:** Western language of "always," "forever," and "perfect" is misleading. Practice is about rhythmic cycles, not a permanent state.
*   **Questions are Often a Hindrance:** Intellectual questioning often stems from and reinforces dissatisfaction (*dukkha*). The answer is to drop the question and return to being satisfied with the present moment's "enough-ness."
*   **The Trap of Maps and Powers:** Obsession with progress maps, attainments, or magical powers is a distraction. It keeps you living in the past/future and in a state of wanting. Real power is the skill to be happy and handle anything *now*.
*   **Rebirth vs. Reincarnation:** Belief in reincarnation (a solid soul passing on) is harmful because it encourages postponement ("I'll fix it next life"). The Buddha taught **rebirth** as the moment-to-moment rebirth of selfish patterns (*dukkha*). Ending *dukkha* now ends that cycle.
*   **Relaxation, Not Force:** Practice is about **relaxing** into a smile, a good feeling, and a stable mind—not about "strong determination" or forcing stillness, which creates tension.

### Conclusion: The Attitude of "Enough"
The ultimate skill is developing the attitude of satisfaction and the confidence that you can handle anything by changing your thoughts. The goal is not to become a person who *has* something special, but to become someone who, through unremitting practice, can create a wholesome reality in any moment and knows they can. The talk ends, as it emphasizes one should, on a high note: the practice itself should be joyful and lead to immediate well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

This talk is rich with metaphors and stories to illustrate key points about meditation practice and Buddhist philosophy. Here are the main ones used:

### **1. The Blind Men and the Elephant**
This is the central metaphor of the talk.
*   **What it is:** A story where ten blind men each touch a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, tail, etc.) and come away with completely different, conflicting ideas of what an elephant is.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker A (Dhammarato) uses this to critique "Western Buddhism." He suggests that many practitioners and schools focus on one specific technique (like breath focus or body scanning) and mistake that single part for the entire path (the whole elephant). He positions his teaching as an attempt to show the larger, integrated picture.

### **2. The Dance / Chorus Line**
*   **What it is:** A metaphor comparing the mind's activity to a dance. A dancer on stage is too close to see the whole pattern, while the audience, sitting back, can see the synchronized "chorus line."
*   **How it's used:** To explain the progression of insight. First, you focus on single objects (like a dancer focused on her immediate steps). After developing stability (like moving to the audience), you can "draw back" and see the larger patterns of how all mental phenomena (thoughts, feelings, sensations) interact and dance together—seeing *anicca* (impermanence) and the "dance routine that is reality."

### **3. The Mallet and the Drum**
*   **What it is:** A metaphor for "unremitting mindfulness."
*   **How it's used:** To correct a common misunderstanding. Mindfulness isn't about holding the mind perfectly still on an object forever (which is impossible). Instead, it's like a mallet rhythmically striking a drum—a continuous, relaxed *returning* to awareness, over and over, creating a sustainable rhythm or habit.

### **4. The Jigsaw Puzzle / Mosaic**
*   **What it is:** The Buddha's teachings (Dharma) are compared to a box of jigsaw puzzle pieces or mosaic tiles.
*   **How it's used:** To illustrate how Buddhism is often presented in the West—as a collection of disjointed pieces (suttas, techniques, lists) with only a partial picture on the box. The implication is that many are trying to assemble the puzzle without all the pieces or a clear view of the finished image, whereas his teaching aims to provide the complete picture.

### **5. The Bull Elephant / Lion (Symbol of the Buddha)**
*   **What it is:** The Buddha is described metaphorically as a "bull elephant" or a "lion."
*   **How it's used:** To convey qualities of confidence, strength, and authority that come from genuine understanding. The "balls" or "cojones" of the elephant (referring back to the blind men story) symbolize the unshakable confidence that arises when you *know* you know the correct path from direct experience and evidence, not just belief. This is contrasted with the need for external validation.

### **6. The Broken Little Red Wagon**
*   **What it is:** A child's broken toy.
*   **How it's used:** To contrast two attitudes on the path. The first is the victim mentality: "I need someone else (a guru, magical powers, a plastic Jesus) to fix my wagon (my suffering)." The second is the empowered, playful attitude: "I can be happy fixing and playing with my broken wagon myself." This illustrates the shift from seeking external salvation to developing internal skill.

### **7. The Map and the Territory**
*   **What it is:** A classic metaphor distinguishing a representation (the map) from the actual reality (the territory).
*   **How it's used:** To warn against the "map trap." Meditators can become obsessed with maps of progress (like the "Progress of Insight" maps), mistaking the map for reality. The map can be a useful guide, but you must be present in the actual, changing "territory" of your immediate experience. Clinging to a map that says "meditation is hard work" can prevent you from seeing the reality that "it's easy" when you relax.

### **8. The Grin / Smile**
*   **What it is:** A physical expression used as a metaphor for a wholesome mental state.
*   **How it's used:** The "grin" represents the embodied feeling of *piti-sukha* (joy/happiness) and relaxation that is the goal. It's not a forced smile but a relaxed, natural one that comes from wholesome thoughts and satisfaction. Holding a tense grin is compared to the wrong effort of trying to "hold" the mind still, whereas the correct practice is to "relax into" the grin (and the joyful state).

### **9. Fire Kasina and External Objects**
*   **What it is:** A reference to meditation practices focusing on external elements like fire, water, or earth disks (kasinas).
*   **How it's used:** As a cautionary story. The Buddha learned to concentrate using these but found them ultimately unsatisfactory. The speaker uses them to illustrate the error of expecting the meditation *object itself* (like fire) to do the transformative work, rather than using the concentrated state to investigate and purify the mind internally.

### **Minor Stories & References:**
*   **Adam and Eve:** Used to illustrate how duality (judging things good/evil) destroys our innate "paradise" or peace.
*   **Crucifixion:** Briefly referenced to discuss the ultimate point of "letting go" of the struggle to cling to life/breath in the face of extreme suffering.
*   **Krishnamurti & the Dalai Lama:** Cited as examples of wise individuals who renounced the limiting systems they were raised in (Theosophy for Krishnamurti, the *tulku* system for the Dalai Lama), emphasizing the need for practical wisdom over tradition.

**In summary,** the metaphors consistently serve to:
*   Critique fragmented, technique-obsessed approaches to meditation.
*   Illustrate a holistic path that moves from focused stability to broad, joyful insight.
*   Emphasize self-reliance, skill development, and the cultivation of immediate satisfaction over striving for future goals or magical outcomes.
*   Contrast unwholesome, tense striving with wholesome, relaxed practice.
