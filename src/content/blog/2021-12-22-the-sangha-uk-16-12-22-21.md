### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel like I need to start practicing more every day.

**Speaker B:** You feel like, sorry, you do, or?

**Speaker A:** I feel like I need to practice more every day.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Because I feel like I'm almost like, it's almost like I know what I need to do, but I've kind of been hesitant to begin to actually do it because I've been like practicing every day. And, you know, I feel like I've been getting these like almost glimpses here and there where I'll just be like meditating and, you know, I'll just be observing my subjective reality as I meditate, seeing the difference kind of the deeper I go into it and focus on the sensations that are arising.

**Speaker B:** Ron, I think we might be struggling with your internet as well, brother. Skype is throwing you into 120 frames per second every now and then. You're going full speed ahead and then slowing down. And I can hear you.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's just I'm getting a lot of speed up and slow down in your dialogue.

**Speaker A:** It might just be the Wi-Fi.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it could be, could be. I'm looking good this end. Let's try again.

**Speaker A:** How am I right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's still— I see your mouth move first and then, uh, and then I get some really fast audio coming through.

**Speaker A:** I'm gonna— is it better now?

**Speaker B:** My built-in speakers. That does seem a little better. Go again.

**Speaker A:** I just went off the Wi-Fi. Is it better now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is better.

**Speaker A:** All right,

**Speaker B:** you were about halfway through. Yeah, you feel like you know what you need to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I've just kind of been— I don't want to say hesitant, it's just I'm still kind of like, I feel like in my like in my cycle of like my past habituations.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** You know, like I feel like I need to like rewire my brain, so to speak, to be able to better devote myself to my practice.

**Speaker B:** Reminds me of an experience I had in meditation. I'd been having all these wonderful experiences but I was still reaching for the old things that I used to reach for.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I realized during this sit, I actually feel way better now than I do when I reach for those old things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know. And that's— see, that's the weird part, because I, you know, for the most part I do as well when I'm sitting down. You know, sometimes I'll have days when I don't really want to, but for the most part, when I sit, I do, like, you know, I feel content with the present moment and this and that. And then, you know, just so happens that later on in the day, I kind of like put myself in the position to be able to return to that. And, you know, since it's there, like I've already practiced today. So I say why not?

**Speaker B:** Why not?

**Speaker A:** Because at the end of the day, I think it's also important not to lose sight of what you're actually doing on a day-to-day basis as well.

**Speaker C:** Hmm,

**Speaker B:** depends what you want.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I know. Like I was really thinking I need to prioritize, but now I also told myself on New Year's, I was gonna, you know, because I go back to college then. So I told myself I was just gonna try to, you know, attack the craving directly at the source, you know, not try like not to give myself like anything to escape to and just like sit down and practice for multiple hours each day to try to deconstruct the solidity in my mind before I can reconstruct it again.

**Speaker B:** Sounds wonderful.

**Speaker A:** I feel like there's a but coming.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm trying to avoid a but, actually.

**Speaker A:** Like, obviously it's not something that's going to happen over a few days, you know, but I wanna— well, all of

**Speaker B:** this supposes that there's some stuff in the mind that needs to be deconstructed, then that there's something else that can be reconstructed. And it's not a terrible— it's not

**Speaker A:** something in the mind per se, it's just the, the solidity of it. You know, the appeared solidity of it, right? Because although it does not have any solidity behind it, it still appears to be so simply because of the years of conditioning that I've had before I started going down this path, right?

**Speaker B:** But I think you'll agree that the way to get to those hours of practice that may or may not be necessary in the end is to do one moment and then another and then another and then another and then another. Yeah, opposed to thinking about, hey, well, it's gonna be a few hours.

**Speaker A:** Typically not. I mean, I wouldn't do like a few hours at once, but I was also talking to Joe the other day And he was telling me how like, I think it was something about how like the mind starts to get like to a next, like a higher level of calm after like maybe like an hour, hour and a half. And, you know, I think I usually get just about an hour a day, if maybe a little less sometimes. I was thinking maybe if I sat down a little longer too, and then, you know, I did it like more throughout the day, I might be seeing much more progress.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you're talking about a significantly different state that comes around after that prolonged sit?

**Speaker A:** Well, not— well, kind of yes and no. Like, it's hard to explain. It's just— it's always hard, you know. When I'm meditating, I'm doing my body scanning, and when I do my body scanning, what I try to do is I try to tune in to only the raw sensations. And, you know, I feel like after I'm doing that for a set amount of time, it's kind of easier to focus on them as raw sensations without the other conditionings. That, you know, we tend to put on things just as normal human beings. And, you know, I just feel like after I've been doing that for a while, for like an hour, hour and a half, it would be like much easier.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Then, you know, if it was just starting practice out of nowhere.

**Speaker B:** The only encouragement I would give then is to remain open to the possibility of it happening sooner, right? As opposed to making it some fixed time frame that we must sit for in order to get the benefits.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, no, for sure. I don't think there's like I'm not seeing it as there's like a certain time frame. I just, I want to sit more.

**Speaker B:** Cool, right? Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like I want to dedicate— yeah,

**Speaker B:** I mean, the whole, the whole game is up then, right? Because if we want to sit more, it's going to happen naturally. We're just doing what we enjoy. Yeah. That's the stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then how are you when you're up and about throughout the day? You're talking about these benefits of sitting.

**Speaker A:** How's the Anagami doing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. How's the kind of moment-to-moment mindfulness?

**Speaker C:** Well,

**Speaker A:** I do notice where there are kind of times when I zone out, so to speak, and it's just I'm not necessarily there focused on anything. Reality is just kind of going through the motions on its own. And then there are other times when I like I come about and I just stop, take a second, you know, kind of observe the paradox of consciousness within myself. And then just, and then I just like feel for sensations, try to just observe what's going on in my body.

**Speaker B:** Cool. Sounds great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but other than that, everything's like so normal. It's just, you know, me hanging out with my friends. Life continues.

**Speaker B:** Sounds delightful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. No, I've definitely felt my mind, for the most part, it gets a lot more quiet lately and I'm able to stay present a lot more.

**Speaker B:** What a relief.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, it's like, it's starting to feel like there honestly is nothing to be like chasing after. I don't know, it's hard to explain.

**Speaker B:** It is hard to explain. All this stuff is always hard to explain. Yeah, that sounds great. Because indeed, as long as we're chasing, there's a kind of wanting behind that, and we know that wanting is— yeah, exactly, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just kind of hard with like the wanting stuff because like I feel like it's somewhat difficult to find the balance between wanting on the relative level and wanting on the spiritual level, so to speak, because at the end of the day, on the spiritual level, to want anything that's not already there is a signification of not having it. But on the relative level, you know, I'm sure everyone aspires to be successful and to be able to provide for themselves.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm not sure about everyone if we include the noble monks Well, yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** But, you know, although I am going down this path, I think it's more than fair to say I'm not going to be like a noble monk one day. You know, I was born into like a pretty busy society and I'm a part of that society. And I feel like whether I'm enlightened or not, I will still be a part of that society, you know. Personally, I do want to provide for myself as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, now we can separate the noble from the monk. Noble just means above the world. Yeah, supramundane, in the world but not of the world. Is the way that Jesus Christ said it, meaning not pulled about, not reaching for, not pushing away, satisfied with things as they are. From there then, if you have a mutually beneficial action to take, you're free to take it. But I struggle to imagine you engaging in any acts that are not win-win, Ron.

**Speaker A:** No, of course not.

**Speaker B:** Right? So the only thing to consider then is the difference that Dhammarato calls out between liking and wanting. The difference being, in wanting, we're not okay if we don't get it. In liking, we might have a preference, we might make a decision to go out and do something, but we're okay if it doesn't work out. Yeah, right. And in that way, we can be in the world but not of the world. Hey, Doug.

**Speaker D:** What's up?

**Speaker B:** Just chilling.

**Speaker D:** My connection is sometimes a bit shaky. It's not that stable right now, so I'm being kicked out on and off.

**Speaker B:** Right, and we've got some noise on your line, which is why I keep muting you.

**Speaker D:** Really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** What kind of noise?

**Speaker B:** Sort of sounds as though you're outside among the wind and rustling leaves, though when you speak, it's suppressed, so we can't hear it right now.

**Speaker D:** And yet, and now, was it there when I didn't speak?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker D:** Then it might be the— hang on, the tablet is at the charger. Let me check if I put the charger back in, if the noise is back. All right.

**Speaker B:** A mystery.

**Speaker D:** That's a bummer.

**Speaker B:** A mystery. How's your day been? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Man, I'm thoroughly exhausted. I did the drive to my parents' place now for the holidays.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** And driving, apparently driving longer, longer distances right now, it really brings something out. I had to, I was basically forced to make a stop again because I was freaking the fuck out. It's hard to describe really what happened, but again, that I'm still getting used to these moments when there's just experience and no one who's experiencing it. And apparently that driving is very, very conducive for that happening for me lately.

**Speaker B:** Cool.

**Speaker D:** I can't really enjoy it yet. There's still something inside that insists on being being very freaked out by it.

**Speaker B:** And can you see that freaked-outness as part of that whole grand show?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, you add that freaked-outness to that there's no one there experiencing it, just the experience.

**Speaker B:** And it becomes a part of that

**Speaker A:** whole— Yeah, it's kind of like a last defense type of thing. It's like a last defense buffer because you can react to yourself driving as an experience without an experiencer, but then you have fear or anxiety, you feel this emotion. Or an experience that brings up an emotional attachment. And that kind of brings you back to the idea of a self.

**Speaker D:** Can you repeat the first part of what you said? The connection made it so I couldn't understand anything.

**Speaker A:** Well, I was basically saying it's like another layer of defense for your mind. Because you're having this experience with no experiencer, but then you feel fear, anxiety, which you have an emotional attachment to, and you attach it to the rest of the experience from a subjective manner almost. And that kind of solidifies your idea of a separate self.

**Speaker D:** That might be.

**Speaker B:** Does that sound accurate, Doug, that it brings you back into selfing when the fear arises?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because, you know, when you're driving, you feel the experience with no experiencer. But then when you feel the fear and the anxiety, there is someone there experiencing it.

**Speaker B:** Um, maybe.

**Speaker D:** Right, today it was like, holy shit, I'm disappointed. It was very quite challenging. I had like an hour or something of a forced break where

**Speaker B:** I This is going to be tricky with your connection the way it is, brother.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'm going to try something, and if it doesn't work, then I'll maybe just leave it be for today.

**Speaker B:** Okay, brother.

**Speaker D:** See you in a bit.

**Speaker B:** Okay, ciao.

**Speaker A:** Bye, Doug.

**Speaker B:** Good luck. Hey, Arhat.

**Speaker C:** Hey, I got my cam turned off. I'm still working and really stressed out.

**Speaker B:** Oh, brother.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you came to the right place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker C:** But you know, like, 2 days ago on the night, I woke up at 3 AM. I was like, what a great time to meditate and practice. So I started practicing welcoming my emotions. Like, since I've been stressed, so stressed from work, I'm like, okay, I'm going to invite them. And I was like, oh, hey, fear, welcome. Hello, Arhat. And well, that helped a lot. Like, that really helped a lot. I don't know if I'm kind of like entering into a maniac stage where like I really think like my work, like I don't know what happened months ago. Like I was into a project where I only was using Photoshop. It was FIFA.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I remember you saying.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and I was like that project, like it really got the best out of me. Like, oh my God. And since then, I haven't been able to focus on this new project. Like, I really haven't been able to.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I'm hearing two things here already. First of all, can you take the stress that you're feeling right now and give it the same treatment that you gave in your 3 AM meditation? Hello, old friend. We meet again.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think it can. I think it can.

**Speaker B:** Make yourself comfortable. Or alternatively, if you can't play by the house rules, out you go like a dog with muddy paws. Shoo, shoo, shoo. But in this house is a house of kindness and mutual respect. So, Stress, If you can't sit nicely in the corner, there's no room for you. I sense a reluctance, brother.

**Speaker C:** Like, it's really like, like there's fear attached to it. Okay, like there's real, like a strong fear that is like I'm unattached to what that fear can bring, like what that fear is giving me, but it's still there like a little voice like, oh, it's gonna happen.

**Speaker B:** So every time you see this, that seeing is a success, right? Yeah, objectively speaking, that's a success. You're a practitioner, you decided to do the Buddha's practice, and so here we are. And when you see that every time is a success, now as soon as you tune into that success, now you're hacking that biochemistry. You're zooming out, you're going up one level. You're saying, okay, well, so fear, stress can come and go, can do what it pleases. I'm more interested in the success because I'm more interested in my practice than I am in my work. Yeah,

**Speaker C:** that's the thing. Like, I like my job, but this thing, like, not being able to make this thing, like, to achieve this work, like, it really is like, I like it, but I'm not doing it right. So I'm like, oh, maybe I'll lose my job, and I'm gonna have to work 3 times to get another job.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's a lot of suturing in there, isn't there?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What's going on right now?

**Speaker C:** Like right now, like right now there is like— I cannot get this done. Like I've been unable for 3 days to get this done, and I'm not sure Like, well, my boss is trying to— is starting to press me a little bit, like not too much, but a little bit. He's patient enough. And

**Speaker B:** so what's the process by which you're going to get this thing done?

**Speaker C:** I'll get a go with Bhikkhu.

**Speaker B:** Crazy details about your job. I'm just trying to bring you around to process orientation. Yeah, like, because at the moment you're very much focused on the result, right? I can't get the result. How do you get the result? By a process. Now maybe I'm preaching to the choir here. Have you come across this idea previously of process orientation versus results orientation? No. Okay.

**Speaker C:** No, I haven't done that.

**Speaker B:** Pretty much what it says on the tin. The way that I describe it to a lot of drumming students when they're getting frustrated with the lack of process or that they can't get something that they want is I say to them, imagine you had a robot and you had to program this robot to learn to play the drums. And so you go, okay, step 1, come into the practice room. Step 2, sit down at the drums. Step 3, pick up the sticks. I say to them, what step in that process is getting frustrated or getting scared?

**Speaker C:** Okay, yeah. Right.

**Speaker B:** It ends there because it's not part of the process by which the robot is going to learn to play drums. So what's the process by which you're going to get this result that you need in your work? And is frustration and fear or anxiety part of that process?

**Speaker C:** No, it's not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So we can just kiss it goodbye. They don't need you. I know you're here because this is what we've been doing for millions of years.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I know you're trying to get me out of the way of the rampaging dinosaur. Thanks for getting my ancestors far enough so that they could all fuck so that I can sit here and have this nice chat with my brother.

**Speaker C:** I know.

**Speaker B:** But I don't need you anymore. You're not gonna help me to get this work done.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's better, that's better.

**Speaker B:** Good,

**Speaker C:** good. Yeah, it's like, thank you, but you're not helping anymore.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, yeah, you're not part of the team for this one. You need to sit this one out. There's no use for you. Should I find myself running from a dinosaur? Now I know humans and dinosaurs never coexisted, but it's a fun image. Should I find myself running from a dinosaur, I'll give you a call, anxiety. I'll give you a call, fear.

**Speaker D:** We can still hope that Jurassic Park comes into reality someday. Fingers crossed.

**Speaker B:** And look, you know, we're probably never gonna actually evolve away from the hardware in here and here that does anxiety and fear, but we can leave it sleeping. Should we ever be in a real fight or flight situation, then that biochemistry will start to tick again. But we don't need it. We don't need it in most of our daily activities. Certainly not to sit at the computer. Certainly not to deal with the boss.

**Speaker C:** Certainly not.

**Speaker B:** Right? We all know what kind of behavior bosses respond best to, which is cool as a cucumber.

**Speaker C:** I know. I was just thinking, in the interview they asked like, how do you act under pressure? On pressure times. I can't remember, I cannot translate it right now, but now I'm like, well, I'd be cool, man. Like, I gotta be chilling. Like, yeah, I can't do it. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And, and the boss is always gonna prefer to hear, you know what, I'm struggling with this one, especially if you can go into why in your process Right, we go back to our drumming robot, right? Well, it's step 35 that I'm really struggling with. Maybe they can give you some help.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like there's some other stuff, like I will tell my boss, like, I'm struggling here because of here, so he sent me someone to help. And most of the time, like, Both of us, the one that's helping and me, like, we are both going crazy, like, wow, I don't know what is going on. And there's like the person who's helping me is the one who's most experienced, and so we go back and we tell him like, we really don't know what's going on, so it's gonna take a while.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** And well, I really think like 50% of the times like it's the program. Okay, but I don't know, like, it's always this step which is causing problems. Okay, oh, it's this step.

**Speaker B:** So, so then if, for example, it is a software issue, then all you need to do to cover your tracks, so to speak, is put a finger on that issue, and then you can say to the boss the software is misbehaving. It's not my problem,

**Speaker E:** right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So there's always a process, right? No matter how much you have to zoom in, the process here might be one of troubleshooting, right? Is it this that's going wrong? Is it this that's going wrong? Is it this that's going wrong? And by trial and error, even if you have to try 200 things, eventually you get to the thing that's the problem, and then you've got something to bring to your boss.

**Speaker C:** Okay. Right.

**Speaker B:** As opposed to just that kind of throwing your hands up in the air saying, I keep trying and it's not working. Might be time to like switch your direction to figure out what's not working.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** See, I don't know the specifics. Or take it to your boss at that point and say, we keep hitting a wall here, boss. Do you want me to investigate what the problem is, or do you want me to keep trying? Now it's your boss's decision.

**Speaker C:** Okay, right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** As opposed to just holding it all yourself. It's not working and I don't know why it's not working. What has your strategy been so far, brother? Just to keep trying?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like I keep trying different processes on like this one, this one, this one, this one. None of them are 100% working.

**Speaker B:** So, okay, so maybe, maybe document that a little bit and then take it to your boss and say, I'm trying these various processes. The software keeps saying this. What do I do? This is costing us a lot of time. And so you're— by doing that, you're bringing the boss onto your team saying, this is our problem, this is what I've tried, this is what's not working. And then again, maybe do you want me to go in the direction of troubleshooting? Do you want me to keep coming up with new processes that might work? Right, yeah, again, I don't know the specifics, but yeah, sounds like your boss is pretty chill. Yeah, um, I think it's quite common, isn't it, that we feel that if we're not doing what's asked of us, it's on us and we need to find a solution and we can't tell the boss and we have to produce the goods.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, like not all the time, like yeah, most of the time I go with the team, I go with the boss, I go with people that's not on my team, like hey man, I'm having this trouble, can you help me out? And they always say like yeah, of course, okay, I can help you, let me just get this training and I'll call you, and they call. Right now it's like Man, when I work on my projects for my portfolio, it's like, like I have zero problems, like not at all. Like this face, it's like, it takes me 10 minutes. Once work, it can take me up to 30 hours to figure out, like, like I really don't know if there's some kind of blockade, like really is like disturbing that happens.

**Speaker B:** Working with the same software. On the same projects. Yeah, bizarre. Well, indeed, it could be this anxiety, fear, frustration. Yeah, quite amazing what happens in selective focus when that cortisol shows up, where if we can stay cool and calm and collected, then our focus is wide open. To see potential solutions. Could be that when you're working on your portfolio, you're more relaxed because there's no way, right? Yeah, yeah. So the antidote, of course, is practice. Can you practice with that fear, anxiety, frustration as it shows up? Don't need you, you're outdated,

**Speaker C:** right? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We don't need you on this project. And with process orientation, again, if you can really do some practice with that and hook into it, when you're in process orientation, there's absolutely no difference between your portfolio work and your professional work. It's just process. It's always just this step right now. Then the next, then the next, but never thinking too far ahead, not thinking about consequences, not thinking about results.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah,

**Speaker C:** more process-oriented than results. And that's happening too in my meditation.

**Speaker B:** Which one?

**Speaker C:** The process. Like, I'm more oriented on the results of my meditation than the process. Yeah, danger. Yeah, yeah, I know.

**Speaker B:** And you, right, you know, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like, that's what I've been like trying different meditation styles. Like, this one that welcoming the fear, anxiety, and welcome Yes, eat whatever you like. Like, this is like an endless space, like limitless, whatever you want. You want to build a wall here? Oh, come on. Yeah, like, like, I remember last week Joe said, talk about loving kindness.

**Speaker E:** Hmm.

**Speaker C:** I'm like, yeah, I gotta practice that more, like a lot more. It's really— and I'm gonna start with myself, with my— well, I don't know, I like loving kindness. Great.

**Speaker B:** Now that's an excellent reason to practice loving kindness, right? And the reason I asked is because I wondered if you might say, because I want a result.

**Speaker C:** I like it. It's a love like, well, when I practice love, I become love and it just all goes like.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** And chill and friends.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great. But whichever of these techniques you're working with, results orientation ain't gonna cut it. Ain't gonna cut it. That's literally the opposite of how we want to be using our time when we sit, right? We sit to sit. We practice loving kindness. To be loving kindness. We practice Anapanasati to be mindful of the breath. We gladden the mind to gladden the mind. Yeah, yeah. And there's a wonderful demonstration and practice of process orientation. The ultimate process orientation, because there is no result.

**Speaker C:** It's just this.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, yeah. And as you practice that, of course, then you'll see the benefit. Seeing the benefit, now you've got evidence, so you say, well, why the hell wouldn't I act this way in work too?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** I have a question about gladdening the mind.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker F:** Um, sometimes when I'm on my own, um, it's difficult for me to gladden the mind, whereas if I'm in a conversation with someone, it's a lot easier because they can give me encouragement, like what you were giving to Rulas. Yeah, but, um, when I'm on my own going about my day, it can be very difficult, and I sometimes feel like I just can't do it at all.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** And like, I can't just like chuck out the negative thoughts and feelings. What advice would you have for that situation?

**Speaker B:** Well, good news, Sangha isn't only around when you're on the video call,

**Speaker C:** in

**Speaker B:** that you can guarantee even with the short interactions that we've had that we will all agree with you that a moment of mindfulness is a success.

**Speaker F:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if you're finding it difficult to rely upon yourself to generate that successful feeling, that gladdening of the mind, and you can say, well, hey, all my buddies agree, all my buddies agree that this is worthwhile, useful, successful, right? So it's objectively worthwhile, objectively successful. It's an objective thing, right? And actually, then we can expand this out. When we say Sangha, we're not just talking about our little group here. We're talking about millions of practitioners over thousands of years.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Good Buddha himself, all of whom agree that when you're mindful in a moment, that's a success.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, no, I agree. Yeah, yeah, that's it.

**Speaker B:** Do you think that helps?

**Speaker F:** That absolutely helps. I think I get what you're trying to say.

**Speaker B:** Great. I struggled with that myself for some time, and then I realized that I wasn't on my own.

**Speaker F:** I have, um, I have a corollary question, which is sometimes I can gladden the mind, but the emotion doesn't change. Um, so I'll still feel like the emotion, but it won't be like painful anymore. Like, I'll still be in that sort of gladdening percentage range. I sort of imagine like it's a seesaw that tips in two ways. So I'll still be like tipped to the gladdened side, but the emotion will still be there. Um, Does that have anything to do with Dark Nights of the Soul, or is it like a higher order of gladdening when you can do it and the emotion's still there?

**Speaker B:** I like the idea of a higher order. I like the idea that brain chemistry can do what it likes. The chemicals in the body can do what they like. We're interested in perspective. We're interested in how we're seeing things in a moment. The— and the other part of that is just that there is a physical truth to— if I've been feeling crappy for a while, then there's going to be some cortisol in the body. Yeah, yeah, chemistry, right? And so, um, in that case, it might be appropriate to get up and move the body whilst the mind is gladdened, just to run off that chemical load.

**Speaker F:** Oh, that's a good, that's a good tip. I hadn't thought of it like that. That's brilliant.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And of course, as you practice, um,

**Speaker F:** I normally just sit around all day, so that's actually really helpful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and, and as you practice, uh, another important, uh, one to remember with all of this is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa calls mindfulness at the point of contact. So that we're developing this skill of gladdening the mind. Sometimes we only think to gladden the mind down the line when that cortisol has already flooded the bloodstream because we've been wallowing in all that other stuff for who knows how long. And what we're doing is we're practicing to close the gap between feeling shitty and gladdening the mind. And at some point that gap closes and closes and closes and closes and closes until that gladdening of the mind actually shows up first. We're mindful at the point of contact of some stimulus that might have previously given us cause to feel bad. Now we say, I see you and I'm just going to feel good.

**Speaker F:** That's brilliant. That's really, that's a really good explanation. That's really put my mind at ease, actually.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker F:** Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** I'll sleep well tonight. Dhammarato, have something to add?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, one thing, this is, I've kind of noticed it in myself. I don't know, Robert, how long you've been at this practicing gladdening the mind, about and how long you like, how long you before spent your life feeling like shit, basically. I'm oversimplifying here, of course, but of course I can relate to what you're saying that like I can congratulate myself for seeing and yet still feel the way I felt before. Of course, as you may have noticed so far, or up until now, you can't do anything, so to say, against emotions. When they show up, they'll show up and they'll stay as long as they want to, so to say. Generally speaking, you can't necessarily make them go away.

**Speaker B:** We can influence.

**Speaker D:** Yes, we can. But it's not that you'll— you'll just—

**Speaker B:** oh, we're losing you, brother.

**Speaker D:** So it might still— it's not that— it's not that you could forcefully get rid of it.

**Speaker B:** Um, there's a chemical element in play. Yeah, it takes a little time to steer the ship.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and I would say already it is quite a success for being able, even while you're feeling shitty, to be able with some corner of your being to acknowledge it and congratulate yourself for that seeing. So I'd say I'm no expert on it either. But I'd say it's definitely a matter of practice and also of seeing like, okay, I won't necessarily get rid, so to say, of unpleasant things with this, but I can have more say in how I approach them.

**Speaker B:** Depends on the severity, right? If there's just a little Dukkha around, well, we can You know, and it's as simple as laughing at a joke, right? So it's not even necessarily exclusive to practitioners. Folks can be feeling real shitty and then laugh at a joke and different reality, right? But then since there's that chemical load in the body, they're likely to feel dragged back into whatever it was they were doing with the mind beforehand. This is where skill comes in. The more skilled we become at gladdening the mind, the more Dukkha we can play with, or perhaps dismiss entirely. And indeed, where we kind of started with this, Robert, was you were talking about being able to gladden the mind even though there was some emotional component remaining, some feeling tone perhaps. So the mind is bright, but perhaps, I don't know, I mean, it's interesting to talk about location, isn't it? Because you see, my hand is going to the chest, right, where we might still experience that there's maybe some tightness left over, some anxiety, etc.

**Speaker F:** Yes, yes, yeah, the body sensations of the emotion. That's a really good Really good distinction to draw there. Yeah, the body sensations of the emotion is still there, but like the mental, like, suffering aspect of it is tipped towards the gladdening, right?

**Speaker B:** And this is the important— this is where we're interested, right? Because this is indeed about Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, the dissatisfaction part. So hey, the body can do what it likes. I mean, look, when we're all old and decrepit, the the body is going to be stiff regardless of what we do, right? The body just gets stiff as it gets old. So if it were the case that freedom were about having a relaxed body, well, we'd all be fucked. Yeah, right.

**Speaker C:** Good point.

**Speaker B:** So you would— you use the phrase like a higher order, right? It is indeed a higher order. We're saying I don't— the body can manifest however it pleases. Again, there's things that we can do to influence that, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But in the end, the body is a physical organism and it's going to manifest in different ways. By gladdening the mind, we can say, I'm cool with that. The body is like the weather.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Some days it's sunny, some days it's rainy. Some days the body is relaxed, some days the body is tense. Some moments it's sunny, some moments it's rainy. Some moments the body is relaxed, some moments the body is tense. And I'm just watching the show. I don't require it to be a certain way in order for me to be satisfied.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, that's a really good way of thinking about it. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** You're very welcome. How you doing, Joe?

**Speaker E:** Hi, how are you?

**Speaker B:** Really well. Good to see you, brother.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, good to see you guys too.

**Speaker B:** How's things on the farm?

**Speaker E:** Oh, you know, I mean, when you were describing like one of those like rainy days, it's definitely one of those rainy days. I'm sitting here like trying to soak in your guys's, uh, energy a little bit, but I'm very aware of the huge tightness in my throat, uh, that is there. And just, yeah, it's just, it's, you know, life can just be a struggle sometimes. But it was also helpful talking to Rulas because I, I realized that I am also doing this like results oriented thing instead of, you know, like seeing the whole process. The difference that I kind of am jealous of Rulon is like he knows what his project is. Sometimes it's like when you're working for yourself, you're just like, holy shit, where do I start? Like, it's— I have the whole thing here and like I have to pick an area to begin with. And yeah, today is just one of these days where I'm just feeling like overwhelmed with decision-making and just a little bit frustrated with— I'm doing this like pond project of digging a few ponds and the guy that I'm working with has just like no understanding of what I'm looking for. And I'm trying to think of it from a process-oriented perspective, but I'm seeing that the results will not it won't turn out how I want it no matter what. So I have to just give up on that result because working within this system that I find myself— but it's still frustrating. It's one of these like losses of like, oh God, like,

**Speaker B:** uh, sometimes I

**Speaker E:** want it to be different, but I— but then you have to follow the law and there's, you know, you have to deal with government administrators and stuff like this. And right It is like, it's just hard to describe how I'm very aware of the frustration that comes with this job of like, I just want to like be able to do what I know is like right for the land and know what is right for like everything, and then it's just a constant barrier thrown your way, so. I don't know. One thing when Robert was talking that I was thinking as I was like, man, but it's always good to remember that like you can cry and smile at the same time.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** Because I kind of feel like that a little bit where I'm just like, oh my God, I— you like, you feel really bad, but then you like, you feel compassion for yourself. Like, all right, you're trying to solve an unsolvable problem.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** Like, you know, that's— yeah, I love that.

**Speaker F:** That's a great way of saying that.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, Robert, go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Oh, I just said I liked what he said. Yeah, about having compassion for yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, beautiful. And can you experience and acknowledge all of that as a success as well, Joe?

**Speaker E:** The fact that I'm here is a success.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Well, and reporting on your experience with such accuracy and depth and that you can see that the frustration is no good, even as it shows up, right? It's not actually going to help. That yes, there's this preferred outcome, and you can see that it's in your best interest to let go of that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that doesn't always mean that we're going to be able to just let go of it in one fell swoop, but that also, talking about process orientation, sometimes part of the process is to change the plan. Yeah, and this is an interesting one with process orientation and results orientation, is that a lot of people, when they hear about that for the first time, will say, well, how do I even get to where I'm going if I'm only process-oriented? But there's still a destination, there's a plan. You make a plan in the beginning, right? And then you go about your process. It's just you're not thinking about the end destination. Well, right now you've got this difficult collaborator and you've got all this legislation. And so taking on board all of that and making whatever changes you need to make part of your process. Yeah, right.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** I think the change I have to make is to see it as more of a long-term thing because The pond is like 3,000 meters squared, so it's quite big.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And like just getting that done, like I should just be like happy with that, but at the same time, the original project plan was to have 4 ponds that were in series, but it's just totally impossible to explain like, so, and then I'm doing it in like French too, which I'm like awful at French.

**Speaker B:** So, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** So it's difficult, but I just have to accept that, like, you know, it's— if I even manage to get one pond dug, then that's a success, you know. Or even if I don't, like, you know, it's also a success because I can, you you know, I tried my best, you know, I'm following the rules. And part of me is like, a lot of times what happens with farming and like this sort of stuff is like, you question yourself, should I have asked for permission or should I have just done it? You know, because like a lot of this stuff, I just do. Like, I mean, I don't ask for building permission, I just put up buildings and like, that's just how it is. That's how it is when you live in the countryside.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker E:** But like, part of me is just like, damn, I wish I wouldn't have said anything in the first place. And then like, it's— I live in the middle of nowhere. Nobody would have noticed, really. You know, they would have been like 10 years later, like, hey, wait a minute, like, there's this pond that's not supposed to be there. But, you know, it is what it is.

**Speaker B:** At that length of time, you could just say, well, I spoke to a

**Speaker E:** friend who— Well, after 10 years, it's fine. Like, that's the law is like, if something is there for 10 years, then then it's okay. So what people do, like, that's with all the buildings that I build and stuff, is that like you just sort of wait out the 10 years. But I wanted to do it with the pond officially because I had heard like horror stories about people that had like got reported by neighbors. People like farmers get really like touchy about water, and so it's one thing that neighbors will report you on, whereas like if you put up buildings, they don't really care. So I'm probably still making the best decision if I'm programming that robot. It's like the best decision-making, right? But it's, yeah, it's still a little bit, a little bit of frustration there. But just talking about it has made me feel better too, right?

**Speaker B:** Regarding the language part, yeah, something came to mind. I wonder if you've considered using an interpreter.

**Speaker E:** Uh, yeah, I mean, I do some— I do sometimes, uh, when, when there are certain situations. This guy specifically, his English is okay. Okay, so, um, in this situation it's not an issue. But yeah, I do have friends that help me to, to translate and stuff sometimes. So I had to do that the last, the last time I had to meet with somebody else. So far it's taken like 6 months and we're not even like to like Step 1 yet, uh, but I'm still— I'm on time schedule because like you have basically what you have to do, you have to get a soil sample between December and March. So as long as we do that, um, then, you know, I'm, I'm the robot that's following the process and yeah, happening how it should.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, but— and so there's your detachment, right, of like, okay, I'm doing the steps. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** But sometimes I ask myself, I'm like, why the hell do I choose to do that? It's like you're like beating your head up against the wall like doing this, you know? Like, there, it's just, it's such a silly thing to choose to do, really. But is it? I don't know. But I, but I love it too, you know, at the same time, you know? So it's like you wouldn't do it if you didn't love it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker E:** Like, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, which is, which is often the domain of the self-employed, right? Yeah, we're taking that other dividend from our work. We could, we could probably be doing things that would earn us more cash.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. Well, like, the thing is, like, I switched professions basically from like something that made a lot of money, uh, before Whoops, you guys still there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, okay, sorry, my connection went. Yeah, but I switched from something where it was like all money-oriented and I was making a ton of money, but I was totally unsatisfied, to like the complete opposite. So it's like some weird shift thing in my brain that— yeah, but yeah, because then that's always in the back of my head too, where it's always like Oh shit, you know you could just go back to doing that. And it's like that carrot that's being dangled up in front of you where it's like, you could always do that. It was so easy. You made so much money. And you're like, yeah, but I was completely miserable. Why would you do that to yourself?

**Speaker B:** Of course, you know that in a moment when this is all playing out, it's just abstraction, right? Lots of pasting and futuring going on. And you can just say, okay, well, we're done with that. Yeah, yeah, kind of fun though sometimes, right?

**Speaker E:** To like play the sort of what-if,

**Speaker B:** play that little story out, right? So, so, you know, again, it comes back to dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, right?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** For as long as we're just kind of having fun dancing that dance, well, no problem. But as soon as it becomes dukkha, well, that's when we we might want to activate that option to say, nah, yeah, we're done here. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** My favorite what-if is I always am going on that I'm like, just fuck all this, just go and be a monk. Like, this is just— that's always my, my like go-to escape thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** But then I realized like that it's also not really my— the image that you have in your head is not really what it's gonna be.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, mine is the exact same one.

**Speaker E:** You have that one there, Rulas?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like, oh, you know, like, I'm this close to becoming Anagami, like, this close, like, to go and just practice the Dharma on such an orthodox way. Like, let's go!

**Speaker B:** I strongly recommend to anyone, and this is, of course, many, many of us practitioners, we have this monk fantasy at some point, and I strongly recommend to anyone who's having that come up a lot, go and hang out at the monastery. Go see what it's like.

**Speaker C:** I think the monasteries here are closed because of the pandemic.

**Speaker B:** So there you go. It's off the menu. Yeah, it's off the menu.

**Speaker F:** Time being.

**Speaker D:** Also, this, this what you guys were sharing, it reminds me of something. One thing that I— it's a joke that I made up.

**Speaker E:** It's like,

**Speaker D:** welcome to the restaurant of Samsara. Today we're serving Dukkha. So what kind of Dukkha will you have today? What flavor of Dukkha do you prefer?

**Speaker B:** We think that fantasizing about being a monk is somehow not on that list, but it so is.

**Speaker E:** And that's the thing, I've been to a lot of retreats and a lot of monasteries and stuff, and I know that I would just get frustrated in a different way, that this is not the solution, you know? Because I'm not a vegan and most monasteries are vegan. And that right there is just like instant conflict point for me that I just know, one, I feel bad in my body because my body's really used to eating like a certain way. And then when you go to a monastery and if they're only eating like one meal a day or if they're like just eating vegan, you know, then it can be a rough transition physically. And then you start to feel it in your body energy-wise. Like, I don't know, I mean, I've never stayed for more than like 2 weeks, but like it never has shifted for me to like be where I feel like not exhausted and starving eating that way. But yeah, I don't know, vegetarian's fine for me. I was a vegetarian for a long time, but like, I don't know, something about the vegan diet, and especially if you're in a northern climate, like I don't know. I mean, it's, yeah, I have very strong views there. Yeah, so you have this fantasy and then you know that it's— that that's also not the solution either. But I don't know, some point I might do it. I mean, some point I might just break and do it.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe, but I suspect that if you keep practicing as you are, you know, you're already telling us all that it's not about the circumstances.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** And as long as we're busy trying to change the circumstances, we're not looking at what really matters. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** One thing that I also thought about here that is kind of fitting in this situation, I think, is that what I recently came to ponder or to realize is even if you should get circumstances arranged in exactly the way you'd like them to be, Um, uh, it's highly likely that there will be a whole bunch of shit coming with these circumstances that you never thought about before, that you'd never bargained for, which annoy the shit out of you.

**Speaker C:** Like the monkey, like you have everything

**Speaker D:** you want, apparently it's just the way that there will be some parts of that deal that you couldn't think about before. There's no no chance you could think about it, that will be there and you're like, shit, I don't like this.

**Speaker B:** And now it gets kind of poignant when you consider many folks work their entire lives to bring about that image, only then to find what you've just described, Doug.

**Speaker D:** And I mean, it's Well, what I really found cool about it, it's not even that the parts about it you like, even if they are exactly the way you want it, it's not even necessarily that which doesn't satisfy. Maybe it's that too, but what really baffled me was this realization of, yeah, but it will bring about a whole bunch of other shit that you're probably not what you signed up for.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And another thing is that all circumstances and things inevitably change.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** How long can you keep them the same if you really try?

**Speaker D:** And it's a pain maintaining something depending on how complex and expensive it is. It's also a pain in the ass.

**Speaker C:** Yep.

**Speaker D:** Even if you manage to.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So what we're describing here is the first noble truth. Yeah, there is Dukkha. There is Dukkha, and the solution does not lie in the world. No matter what you do with the world, you will never find a solution to Dukkha. Because that ain't how it works mechanically.

**Speaker E:** I know for me, I get into the habit of thinking that running away is like the solution though. It's like that's my sort of mental ego structure that has developed. Has been, right, when, when you have difficult situations, run away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see you. Yeah, I see you, escapism.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** And each time you do, you take a gold star. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** And I mean, I mean, Joe, we've talked about this privately as well, but we know, we know where that can lead in the extreme, and that isn't also— isn't too pretty.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, yeah, yeah,

**Speaker D:** I mean, I can relate so much right now because today where I was in a situation where I was like, I just want out of here, get me the fuck out of here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And yet you know— go on, Joe.

**Speaker E:** No, I was gonna say, I think what's weird is that our society is set up a little bit so that it's a little bit easier to escape for a really long time than it's almost ever been in history. Because like, before, you might have not had— like, I mean, we're obviously— you have the economic means to be able to like leave your village, Essentially, I mean, you can change your life. I've done it so many times and I've seen the result. It doesn't work, you know, or setting up your life and having that image that Doug was talking about. I've also done that over and over again. It feels like I'm destined to just keep doing that over and over again, except I know that there's another way. And I know that the Buddha says, hey, take a look at this, and there's a way out of that cycle, you know.

**Speaker B:** But you've done that looking, and you've got some evidence. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** And yet it's so— it's, it's fascinating and frustrating how, how persistent it can be that it comes back and sucks, and we're like, man, maybe, maybe my solution wasn't, uh, would work this time. It's, yeah, it's fascinating.

**Speaker B:** I will be different.

**Speaker D:** Yes, it's,

**Speaker E:** it's, I have to say, you don't end up as like an American in France on a farm without like doing this to the absolute extreme. Like, just, just like a million decisions over and over again, like Run away, run away, run away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So you've got some good evidence in the other direction as well. You really gave it a shot. And the Zen folks like to encourage this in the students. So I think it was Alan Watts who said, maybe this one came up in a recent call actually, in a recent one of these, not too long ago. I remember giving the example to someone that the student says the world is flat and the master says, show me the edge. Yeah, so the fool is encouraged to persist in his folly.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, until he becomes wise.

**Speaker B:** Until he becomes wise. Now the other side of that is, well, that could take a while. So let's get some Dharma in there as well. Let's give the student that alternative so that if at some point he gets tired of walking, he can say, okay, let me try this other thing.

**Speaker D:** I've actually had it like these past few months, especially in like a relationship context where I could really observe myself actively participating in that "the grass is greener on the other side" game. And I think honestly, so far it has been able to see it and being aware of, okay, it might be that there is something even better out there. But I'm also aware that I'm doing this kind of mental gymnastics here, and it has contributed in a big way, in a large way, to kind of sticking around and seeing where it goes and being able to enjoy some more really nice times. Because yeah, I was just to a certain degree, I was aware that what I'm doing might very well just be chasing my own tail.

**Speaker B:** Yep. So the investigation continues. And here we are at the importance of direct experience. We must gain our own evidence.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** By investigation. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And I'm still

**Speaker A:** very

**Speaker D:** fascinated and still a bit perplexed by how the hell I managed, for example, this difficult situation I was talking about earlier today. It— yeah, how the hell did I do that?

**Speaker B:** Well, you're wise, dog. You're wise, and although you still describe a lot of unpleasant sensation, the wisdom is there. And I've seen exactly as I expected to see throughout the time that we've known each other, that that wisdom is leading you out of those unpleasant sensations. So you experience more and more relief.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and it's fascinating. I sometimes feel that my own direct experience truth is somewhere in the middle between what you always emphasize and

**Speaker F:** what

**Speaker D:** is more, and the other extreme, so to say.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and that's exactly my role. Yeah, you see how great the great stuff is. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** And actually, actually, I had

**Speaker B:** one thing

**Speaker D:** that I again was shown today, that even in these very, very challenging situations, there's a little speck of me that somehow knows how to make use of the resources I got.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And that's the dog that I'm speaking to. That's the dog I'm friends with, and I'm saying you're the real dog, if there is one. All this other stuff is just peripheral. Yeah, having a party, and we'll watch the rest of it fall away.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and right now I'm just— I'm pretty, pretty relieved because I'm made this, I made the drive here and I got to a place where I felt more secure and I could just chill a bit and not feel as totally on the edge of breaking as I did a few hours ago.

**Speaker B:** Well, now here you are smiling. Right, yeah, it couldn't have been that bad. Hey Brandon!

**Speaker G:** Hey, what's up?

**Speaker B:** Hey, we're chilling. How you doing?

**Speaker G:** Sorry, I'm not gonna keep my mic on the whole time just to talk because it's a little loud in here. I don't want to give you guys a bunch of background noise, but I'll be listening and jumping in when I hear something.

**Speaker C:** Oh, worth, uh Worth adding. Cool.

**Speaker E:** One thing that I'm struggling with a little bit on what we're talking about is this sort of like living in two worlds thing and feeling like I just want to practice and I, like kind of a feeling of aversion towards like working. And what's challenging is that, like, with farming specifically, a lot of times you kind of have to, like, push yourself a little bit beyond what a normal human would be expected to do, right? Just to give you, like, an example, like, today I had to figure out a way to lift something that if you don't know how to use levers and pulleys and things like this, no one would have known how to do it. And I was by myself and was like, I just have to do this. I have to do it. But I noticed in myself this sort of like kind of voice in the back of my head that's like, why are you doing this to yourself? Like why? 'Cause I know it's physically not that great for my body because it's, I mean, I have tons of problems with my back and Like, uh, yeah, just I'm, I'm all— I've always been wrecking my body. And then at the same time, I, I just like, I just want to practice. Like, I, I don't want to do this, but then at the same time,

**Speaker B:** practice and work are not mutually exclusive.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's just, it's just a challenge because like, man, I mean, sometimes it ends up taking— yeah, I guess the solution is just to like notice it when you're doing it, but it's still a challenge living in both worlds at the same time because a lot of times I'm just like, why am I doing this? Why am I abusing my body doing something that makes no sense that I don't really make money doing? And like, yeah, it just doesn't make sense.

**Speaker B:** Well, so there may well be great reasons to reconsider your premises. For doing what you're doing. But that doesn't stop you from practicing as you're doing it. So you've made a decision to do the thing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Right. There is the option of walking away and not doing it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. I've been doing that a lot more lately. So I've been really proud of myself to be like, I've just been stopping at like 8 o'clock. And that used for me, that's like really good because it used to be that I would just keep going until until whatever it was needed to be done. But like, I've just been walking away from shit and being like, whatever.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker E:** Like a lot more.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker E:** And the funny thing is, is nothing has like broken. Nothing's gone wrong. Interesting. The image that you have in your head, it doesn't actually play out. Everything gets done eventually anyways. It's just I'm not physically exhausted from working 12 or 16-hour days or whatever.

**Speaker B:** You know, right, that sounds much more balanced. You're probably more productive in the hours that you are working, right? But regardless of— again, we're back to circumstances— regardless of what the circumstances are, you can be practicing through all of it. Yeah, anything that's going on. So, so my encouragement would be to have that question of whether or not this is something that's worthwhile doing as a completely separate thing that's not really much to do with whether or not you're practicing, right? Because, you know, you don't have to come sit on your cushion to practice.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, of course.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. It's, it's tempting, isn't it, when we're faced with something that we don't really want to be doing, to say, I wish I was practicing, I could go inside and I could be meditating right now. Well, I could be meditating right now.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, good point.

**Speaker E:** When it's, when it's like shitting rain and like your back is sore and you're just— it's, it's a challenge, you know? It's a real challenge to be there. Like, yeah, but you're right, it is the time to, to practice then. But there's still a part of me that's like, could you not like find something Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker G:** Oh, Brandon. Oh, I was going to say something. This reminds me of like the beginning of Daniel Ingram's book, Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha, and a part in it where he's talking about morality as being the first training and that basically anything we're doing in life, if we're trying to improve ourselves or whatever, even if it's like a normal job, we're like training in that aspect of the Dharma. And I look at that as kind of like an opportunity, like these really hard life situations, like you got to work a long shift or something. Like, it can, if you kind of change the context of how you think about it, it can make it more positive and seem like it's more in alignment with practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, hey, I have an opportunity here. Oh look, there's some Dukkha. Great, I get to practice.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, exactly. That's kind of what I'm talking about. It's looking at things as an opportunity rather than like something you don't want to be doing. You can look at it as like a positive challenge in a sense, even though the stuff probably sucks, like doing a bunch of manual labor like you were saying, like no one really wants to do that too much.

**Speaker E:** But sometimes, sometimes it's rewarding. Sometimes it's rewarding though, because like, for sure. And it depends like on how your attitude is, which is what you're getting at, I think, because like I was shoveling manure the other day and like I had to move like it was a few, I don't know how much, but definitely a few tons of manure. And it took me like 4 days of shoveling. And like, it's, but you like, you feel like one, there's this feeling of like, okay, I know I'm really, really good at doing this because like I know exactly the move that you make, where to put the fork to minimize motion, all this sort of stuff. And at the end of it, when you like see this like big pile and then it's just disappeared, it's like, it's pretty a great like satisfaction that you get that you don't really get from like working on a computer. I've also worked on a computer and just seen numbers on a screen and that's also like, yeah, it can be satisfying too, I guess. They both can be, but yeah, I see what you're saying though. It definitely is an opportunity to practice. It still makes me reevaluate my life a little bit, though, and be like, hey, is there some way that you could, like, make this a little bit easier on yourself? Like, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** I mean, you don't want to work the hardest, like, least rewarding job, of course. Like, try to make it as beneficial for yourself as you can, but realize when you're kind of screwed by life and there's not an immediate solution to, like, fix that thing, you might as well like look at it as positively as you can, even though it's hard to do, but it can help.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and if there's a reevaluation to be made, can we then take our practice through that reevaluation as well, right? So we practice through the shitty thing, and then we practice through making a decision, hey, I'm going to reevaluate, and then we practice through reevaluating. And then we practice through either things staying the same or things changing.

**Speaker E:** It's a real challenge that farming specifically is kind of the ultimate hanging a carrot in front of your face sort of thing. And then it just like repeats every year that you kind of do the same thing and you're like, okay, when I get to this point, like, because I'm at that point right now, like it's December. This is the time to relax. But like, what the mind naturally does and what farmers naturally do, and when they're talking to each other, is they're like, all right, next season. And there's like, right, there's not really much like sitting, like enjoying reward sort of thing. And it's just, it's not healthy to, to do that either, to be like, oh, I worked all year so that I can get my reward now, you know. It's like, no, the reward should be the whole time along the way of like enjoying the whole process. And I'm definitely going to work on that like a lot more of like not like having this image in my head of like where I want my farm to be next year at this time, because that's the natural thing that you're doing when you're planning and stuff. But to enjoy the process.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you've made a solid plan that you're happy with, you can forget about it until it's time to look at it again. Yeah, right. So you make your plan, you say, okay, this is what I'm doing today. No need to think about your plan, right? Or I don't know how it works, maybe you don't need to think about your plan for a week or even a month, you know. Hey, if you're shoveling manure for 4 days, that's the thing to be doing, right?

**Speaker F:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** But, but it's just— but then, I mean, the nice thing with it is that it's so mixed because like, you know, it's just the one time of the year that you have to do it, you know, where you're like, all right, whatever. And then, but what I tend to do, and it's so silly that I see myself doing it, is like I think about it for so long, like, because I'm already like, next year you're going to have to do that again, you know, even though like I'm not doing— I create so much extra suffering, so much unneeded. But the second The second arrow is just like jammed in there, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but see that, and so can you acknowledge that as a success? And now you start to flip the script.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** You know, you know exactly what needs to be done.

**Speaker E:** I know, right? But I still have this monk fantasy. I'm still just like, fuck this, I just want to practice, I just want to read like suttas all day. That's all I want to do, right? And then you go, and then you go to a monastery and you're like, oh shit, but they like, they do a lot of other stuff. Yeah, like they don't really sit around and like just to have this, you know, they have— they still have to do dishes and wash the floors and make food and all this stuff.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, yeah, yeah, there's, there's a monastery to run, right? Yeah. And I mean, it's so paradoxical, right? You're saying, I just want to practice all the time, missing the opportunity to practice right now.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker F:** I can kind of relate to that. I, um, I worked at— I started my, um, my current job was at a meditation retreat center, and when I went for the job, I thought, this is going to be great, you know, the people, all my bosses practice. All the colleagues will also be practitioners. We can just talk about the Dharma all the time. And, um, the only people who like talking about the Dharma is me and like one other young guy who works there. And then all the like people in their like 40s and 50s who've been practicing for years and years, they don't even like to talk about it. They just talk about the food and, and like their lives and stuff. And it was pretty funny. It was like a rude awakening, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, it can be, it can be like that a lot. A lot of times I find What I really like about this group is that people don't seem to too much get stuck in their own shit, in their sort of life story or whatever, but a lot of Dharma groups I've been in, it can be a big focus on suffering, the First Noble Truth, and not really on number 3 and number 4 of the steps towards eliminating that suffering.

**Speaker F:** That's interesting.

**Speaker E:** I don't know why it develops like that. I have theories though that like a lot of people who are like maybe attracted to that sort of an environment, maybe just with their backgrounds that, you know, that it's just developed like that. But it's been very common in my experience of being in groups and being like, wait a minute, like it's again like the Daniel Ingram thing of wanting to stand up and be like, is anybody noticing the breath right now?

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, yeah,

**Speaker E:** I've had a lot, a lot of those moments.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, we're all trained to think that our stories are real important, right? Right. And we're encouraged to examine everything in Dharma circles, so I can believe that. I can believe that that trap is open wide in some communities, yeah.

**Speaker E:** I mean, I've seen a lot of people burn out. Like, I've seen monks and nuns that burn out being a monk or a nun, and you're like, how is that possible? But it's because they're doing so much organizing and retreats and helping so many people that they just forget you know, the practice. Totally.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** But I can also— better to be a nobody than a nun or a monk if you're actually wanting to practice like hardcore. Like, it might not even be optimal to be in that setting, right? There's a lot of stuff that goes on, a lot of things you have to maintain. Like, uh, I've heard, like, for example, like Frank Yang said in his opinion, like, the most awake people he's met were just like people with normal jobs, like not even that, like high-end jobs. They just do something really simple for a living and then they just enjoy it. Like, just really basic stuff.

**Speaker E:** A good reminder. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** it's a good reminder. Yeah, sure. Now I have heard of monks going like way back into whatever grounds the monastery has claimed for itself and really going off into seclusion back there, it's interesting to consider what the logistics might be like. You know, what do you have to do? Whose palm do you have to grease as a monk to not be involved in feeding people and organizing retreats and taking care of the monastery and to just go off into the forest? And how do you grease that palm because you don't have any money?

**Speaker F:** Um, Dag, do you want to go ahead and say your thing first? I had one more question, um, related to what I was talking about with Dan before, um, but I saw you, you were trying to ask something a number of times.

**Speaker D:** Um, yeah, I was just, um, about this, about the— it was about the, um, This thing that in what John said, in so many circles they seem to emphasize especially that first noble truth so much. My impression or my idea about it is that of course we are really good at forming a kind of identity and clinging around our misery. And I think it's easy in these kinds of circles that it can kind of subtly perpetuate itself, even though the label on it is we're trying to work with it, we're trying to get around to it. But when they get kind of— when they stay on that level, It can be a very subtle way of it perpetuating itself because of

**Speaker E:** this

**Speaker D:** identity or structure or this kind of solidified thing has an interest in preserving itself even if it's not serving anyone.

**Speaker F:** That's a really interesting idea, but I

**Speaker D:** could imagine that happening.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, like it has a momentum that keeps going.

**Speaker D:** Yes, like the moment you might— I like this quote, I'm not sure if it's originally by Alan Watts, but if you're gonna If you're gonna get out of hell, you mustn't let the devil know.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, like you have to do it inadvertently.

**Speaker D:** You announce it, he will do everything in his power to keep you there.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that's a really good, that's a really, really interesting way of looking at it actually. Thank you for sharing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Um, is it all right if I ask my question?

**Speaker C:** Go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Okay. Um, sometimes when I can't throw out the old negative emotions, um, and I also can't do what we spoke about before when we make peace with them in spite of the, um, body sensations staying the same, um, trying to make peace with them, uh, leaves me feeling disconnected from my emotions. And like, in your guys' opinions, is it okay to keep trying to do the technique in spite of feeling like the emotional disconnection, or is it better to let myself suffer them without trying to change anything?

**Speaker B:** Well, disconnection is an interesting one. I kind of want to explore that a little bit. Okay, what do you mean?

**Speaker F:** So it's sort of like my mind feels okay, and the body sensations don't feel okay. Um, but it's kind of like there's a— there's like, um, there's like a halfway struggle period between feeling, um, suffering and being caught up in the story, um, you know, of the negative emotions that I'm feeling, and then them resolving. Um, which is like where my mind is gladdened but my emotions aren't. But it's like only part of my mind has been gladdened, so only like the most intellectual part where I'm like, okay, I know rationally that it's true that this isn't an accurate interpretation of my circumstances right now. But that's like the only part that I can really get a grip on and like gladden. So it's sort of like I'm hanging with one finger, I guess. It would be like a way of thinking about it.

**Speaker B:** So that's great. And what I encourage you to throw in there is an acknowledgement of that as a success.

**Speaker F:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** That's a success. And there now you have a legitimate reason generating some good feelings too.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah. I'm not doing it for just no reason at all, but like my my religious faith, or— right, yeah, right, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now you've, now you've broken the seal on the feelings, right? You've accessed that deeper level, so to speak.

**Speaker F:** That's a, that's a really good way of going about that. Um, yeah, no, that, that's, yeah, that's, that's interesting. But Let's say, let's say I, let's say I do that and that did just work for me just now, so I had a very positive reaction. But let's say I do that and I still can't, um, I still can't sort of, sort of overcome these, um, these negative emotions without, without, without feeling this kind of disconnection from them where it's sort of like I'm I can't really feel them, but I can feel like a very depersonalized version of them. So dissociation, I think, is what this is. I didn't use that, I used disconnection, but I think it's what is meant by that, I think. So let's say like I still can't overcome them without dissociating from them. Do you still think it's a good idea to pursue the dissociation route? Because I am at least trying to gladden some part of my mind, or to just let myself feel them without dissociating? Neither of these are essentially getting me to do the technique, these two options. So it's sort of like two hard places, I guess.

**Speaker B:** I recommend experimentation with Dukkha and Nirodha as your compass.

**Speaker F:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Try one Does this take me in the direction of Dukkha or Nirodha? Try the other. Does this take me in the direction of Dukkha or Nirodha? And there's your answer. Cool.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, thank you. I'll really give that a good trial and error after the call, actually.

**Speaker B:** Fantastic. Doug?

**Speaker D:** What I can— I got two things about this. For the first, Of course, it can be, at least I've experienced it that way, that we are— I think this is more the case with more like deeply afflictive states. It can be that the negativity, that it's at least pretty hard, if not virtually impossible in this very moment to put much, so to say, against it, or to really steer into the other direction. At least I have had that experience. So if that should be the case, you could, to the best of your ability of course, try to ride it out a little, as you probably know of that, too shall pass, and then Maybe try gladdening the mind when you are a bit less deep in it. So like, what's the word, like look back on it and acknowledge the success of, oh yeah man, I wrote that out. Yeah, I could, while it was happening, at least I could see it even though I couldn't really do anything against it. It in that situation. Um, yeah, yeah, that's one thing.

**Speaker F:** It's like what Dan said, it's like there's— even if you don't feel the success, the success is still there. Like, and you can, you can kind of remember that after the fact and, and, um, like appreciate that fact.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And another thing that I, uh, that just came to my mind is

**Speaker B:** I'm

**Speaker D:** not sure if this is applicable here, but I would say that if you have both things going on, you making a conscious effort to acknowledge your successes and to gladden the mind, and simultaneously still having some kind of negative emotion happening, that will likely create some experiential dissonance, which I could imagine could also be interpreted as some kind of dissociation. I'm not sure if this helps in

**Speaker B:** any way, but

**Speaker E:** it might be that

**Speaker D:** there is an experience of at least some kind of dissonance there.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, no, I think dissonance definitely describes a lot of what those states are like. Not all of them, but a lot of them, I would say dissonance is very applicable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so this is great. We're building a toolbox here. Yeah, right, of different things you can try. And this one will go up on YouTube, Robert, should you need to come back, because you've now got quite a

**Speaker F:** few different— I will, I will— things

**Speaker B:** to try out in the moment, right? That sutta looks great as well, Joe. I'm going to read that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that one's the one where the Buddha describes like 5 different things to do basically, and he starts with like one and it's like the easiest one, and then he goes to like the 5th one that it's quite— I mean, people remember that one I think because it's the one where he's like, you seize mind with mind by clenching your teeth and pushing your tongue to the roof of your mouth, and and see the whatever for what it is and watch it transform. But the other steps before that are also like a little bit simpler, like go for a walk. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sweep the floor, distract your mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and indeed distraction, yeah, I mean, it's coming right from the horse's mouth there. Wholesome distraction is fine.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, like Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** But check out, I mean, check out that Sutta because it's really good and it's like, it's basically all about right effort and that's kind of what you're discussing right now. It's like, right, that's perfect.

**Speaker F:** Thank you for sharing.

**Speaker E:** So like, I mean, yeah, I think, I think like a lot of people that I've listened to agree that right effort is something that people get hung up on a lot. So yeah, something to investigate anyways.

**Speaker F:** Thank you,

**Speaker E:** Arya. I really like Ajahn Sona. He's this monk in Vancouver and he had like a whole retreat on right effort that I'd actually— I want to do his retreat like virtually myself and like officially because I've watched some of the videos but I haven't like like followed the retreat schedule. But I think, yeah, cool, cool. His teachings are very similar to, um, like they're very in line with, uh, um, Dhammarato. If you're following him, you know, it's a lot of like breath, uh, breath meditation. And, and his is actually his description of, uh, breath meditation, Anicca, is like, it's the, the basic one I always I send to people when they ask how to meditate because it's so clear and precise. And yeah, and I rewatch it when I forget how to meditate

**Speaker F:** too.

**Speaker E:** I'm like, what do I do again? I forgot. I forgot. What is it that I'm supposed to be doing? Oh right, now I know.

**Speaker B:** Well guys, it's time for bed for me. Great hanging out with you all.

**Speaker F:** Good night.

**Speaker E:** Good night, everybody.

**Speaker B:** I'll see you.

**Speaker E:** Good night, everyone.

**Speaker B:** Bye, guys.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for listening. Thank you.

**Speaker F:** Thanks, guys.

**Speaker E:** Bye.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Brenda.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, facilitated by Dhammarato and involving several Sangha friends, revolves around the practical challenges and insights of integrating Buddhist practice into daily life. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice shared:

### **Main Themes & Discussions**

1. **Deepening Practice & Overcoming Habitual Patterns**
   - **Speaker A** expresses a desire to practice more consistently, feeling "glimpses" of progress but held back by old habits. He considers dedicating multiple hours daily to "deconstruct the solidity" of conditioned mind states.
   - **Dhammarato** advises focusing on **one moment at a time** rather than fixating on long sessions. He emphasizes that wanting to sit more will happen naturally if it brings joy.

2. **Mindfulness in Daily Life**
   - Participants discuss maintaining mindfulness off the cushion—while driving, working, or doing chores.
   - **Speaker D** shares an intense experience while driving, where the sense of "no experiencer" arose, triggering fear. The group discusses how fear can re-solidify the sense of self, and how to meet such experiences with awareness.

3. **Process Orientation vs. Results Orientation**
   - **Speaker C** (Arhat) discusses work-related stress and frustration. Dhammarato introduces the concept of **process orientation**: focusing on the immediate step rather than the outcome.
   - The analogy of **programming a robot** is used: frustration and fear are not part of the necessary process to complete a task. The advice is to kindly dismiss unhelpful emotions when they arise.

4. **Gladdening the Mind & Working with Difficult Emotions**
   - **Speaker F** (Robert) asks about gladdening the mind when alone and struggling with negative emotions.
   - Key advice includes:
     - **Acknowledge every moment of mindfulness as a success**, supported by the wider Sangha (past and present).
     - **Gladden the mind at the point of contact** with a negative stimulus, shortening the gap between trigger and skillful response.
     - **Emotions and body sensations may linger** due to biochemistry; gladdening the mind is about changing our relationship to them, not necessarily eliminating them instantly.
     - Use **wholesome distractions** if needed (e.g., walking, sweeping) as taught in the suttas.

5. **The "Monk Fantasy" and Escape**
   - Several participants mention the temptation to abandon worldly responsibilities to meditate full-time.
   - The group cautions that **changing circumstances doesn’t end dukkha (suffering)**. The practice is about finding freedom within any situation, not escaping life.
   - As Dhammarato notes, *"The solution does not lie in the world."*

6. **The Danger of Over-Identifying with Suffering**
   - **Speaker D** observes that some spiritual communities over-emphasize the First Noble Truth (suffering), which can subtly reinforce a **"misery identity."**
   - The importance of balancing insight into suffering with the cultivation of joy and gladness is highlighted.

### **Key Practical Takeaways**

- **Practice in moments**: Don’t wait for ideal conditions or long sessions. Each mindful moment is a success.
- **Gladden the mind first**: Cultivate a positive, kind attitude as the foundation for dealing with challenges.
- **Focus on process, not results**: Whether in meditation or work, attend to the immediate step without being pulled into anxiety about outcomes.
- **Emotions are not the enemy**: Allow them to be, while not letting them dictate your actions. Congratulate yourself for seeing them clearly.
- **You’re not alone**: The encouragement and agreement of the Sangha (community) can be drawn upon even when practicing solo.
- **Experiment**: Use **dukkha (suffering)** and **nirodha (cessation)** as a compass. Try an approach and see if it leads toward more or less suffering.

### **Overall Tone**
The talk is supportive, practical, and grounded in direct experience. The facilitator and participants gently guide each other back to core principles: kindness, present-moment awareness, and a light-hearted perseverance in the face of life’s inevitable difficulties. The emphasis is always on **freedom within the ordinary**, not escape from it.

### **3. Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
- **Houseguests**: Emotions as visitors that can be welcomed or asked to leave if they don’t follow “house rules.”
- **Last defense buffer**: The mind’s attempt to reassert selfhood when experiencing non-self.
- **Chasing your own tail**: The futility of seeking satisfaction in changing external conditions.
- **The carrot dangling**: The illusion that the next achievement or change will bring lasting happiness.

These metaphors and stories help make abstract Dharma concepts relatable and provide practical ways to work with meditation, emotions, and daily life challenges.
