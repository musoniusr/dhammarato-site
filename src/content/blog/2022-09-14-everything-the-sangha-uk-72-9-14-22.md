### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, welcome everyone to the UK Sangha. It is Wednesday and we meet every week here, and there's no real structure to these meetings. We just We talk about, we share insight, we talk about any questions that might arise as pertaining to the Dharma. So we don't talk about normal things. We just talk about things through the perspective of the Noble Dhamma. So that's one thing to understand about these Sangha calls. Is that anything that is brought up is going to be examined through the lens of the Noble Dharma and what Dharma we can learn from it and continue to practice from. So with that being said, if anyone has anything they'd like to talk about that might bring up some good conversation or Simply, you want to share how your practice is going. It's all free, free game from here on. Yeah, okay, that's great. Oh, go for it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, do we have a question?

**Speaker A:** Sorry, I— No, you're gonna go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. You said that's great. I wondered if you were replying to something else.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** No, I was just gonna say, um, that introduction you gave gave me the thought, well, all things are kind of targets for the Dhamma. So in a sense, we could talk about anything in that lens, you know.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Kind of a side thought.

**Speaker A:** No, exactly. Everything is, uh, everything relates to the Dhamma because the Dhamma is everything. Like The Dharma is the natural law of things. So the Buddha says the full fruition of the Dharma, or what this is all leading to, or the full comprehension of the Dharma is Yathā Buddha-dās��ā. So this translates to knowledge and vision of things as they are. So this is the full culmination of what the Dharma is leading to, is just a completely realistic view of things arising and passing away without any delusion, misunderstanding what's really going on here and creating all kinds of problems and cravings and attachments and all sorts of that kind of stuff that really just comes from a misunderstanding, a root misunderstanding of the way that things are. So yes, Dhamma pertains to literally everything, and I think that's one of the biggest transitions in the evolution of someone's spiritual development is this meditation or this practice or this spiritual contemplation, it goes from being something that you do as a hobby, maybe like for an hour a day or here and there when you think about it, to something that you do when every single moment that you possibly can remember to do it. So the practice becomes— I'm not going to say that like now every moment you're practicing, because sometimes you're forgetting, but every moment that you remember to practice, you're practicing. Or seeing the Dhamma, or understanding the Dhamma, or comprehending the Dharma in every moment. And that's kind of like what— that's the only way that you're going to put like some damage in like the habits of ignorance, because you're literally retraining your perceptual system or the way that you think about things from one that produces ignorance to one that produces wisdom. So because these habits of the mind are so deeply ingrained habitually that this is This is what we have been— the way that we've been thinking about things for so long has been filled with all kinds of delusions. Whether it's nature or nurture doesn't really matter. So whether it comes from some inherent quality of how the brain functions or whether it comes from what we were taught, it doesn't really matter because it can be reprogrammed. So, but either way, it's a set of habits or a set of functions that when asleep to kind of run amok and make your life unsatisfactory and even miserable, if we want to take it to the extreme. So there's a lot of fruit, and there's a lot of benefit in waking up to really the source of our own suffering, which is the Second Noble Truth. And Anything that we say about the Dharma is going to be kind of really simple because it's really just going to have to do with the Four Noble Truths. And there's different like fun quirky ways we can talk about the Four Noble Truths. But at the end of the day, if we're talking about the Dharma, we're talking about the Four Noble Truths. And even shorter than that, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So one thing that I've been thinking about a lot recently is people mistake the teachings of the Buddha to be an ontology, so rather than a means to liberation or a means to the end of suffering. So This is a really common mistake because all other religions and all other spiritual practices usually have an ontology that goes along with it. And what is an ontology? An ontology is a statement about reality, the absolute fabric or the absolute nature of reality in terms of its like primary existence. So an ontology, for example, would be it's all dead, inert, Newtonian matter that's just colliding like marbles colliding into each other, and that's what reality is. Or it's all Vishnu, it's all God Vishnu dream, it's Vishnu dreaming up a conscious entities, and it's all consciousness. That's an ontology.

**Speaker C:** We've talked about in the past few calls the difference between why and how. And ontology would be asking all the why questions. When you, like you said, it doesn't matter if this is nature or nurture. It doesn't matter why we're dissatisfied. The fact is that we are dissatisfied, and there's a solution to that problem.

**Speaker A:** I would say It doesn't matter. There is a reason why we're dissatisfied, but the ultimate source of why it's set up this way is not spent time worrying about. So like We don't spend like mental energy, at least in the— I think ontologies are very fun to think about. So it's fun to entertain what the ultimate source of the universe is. But at the end of the day, we're just going to be encountering inescapable limitations to what we can know for certain. So there are some things that we'll never be able to prove or know absolutely for certain, like is there an external reality or is it just a conscious experience internally? But so that's in the realm of ontology. And the Buddha didn't teach ontology. Advaita teaches ontology. Christianity teaches ontology. Every other religion teaches ontology. But the Buddha simply taught suffering and the end of suffering with no claims about any other source or fabric of reality. And then So everything is experiential, and we can examine the experience that we have access to, and we can see certain patterns and emergent properties of our experience as kind of predictable in the same way we can discover the laws of nature And so like we drop a water bottle over and over, we can safely assume that if I hold this water bottle and I open my hand, the water bottle is going to fall. So the Dharma is similar to that kind of approach to how Dukkha operates and works, is that we learn the inner mechanics of how Dukkha arises. And also the mechanics of how Dukkha comes to an end. And then we can make a prediction about how it's going to operate in every given moment and in the future and pay attention when it is taking place. So I can safely predict that if I think If I continue to ruminate angry thoughts, unwholesome thoughts, so thoughts of revenge, thoughts of people who aren't there, thoughts of things that annoy me, things that piss me off in the world, I can safely assume because of my experiential understanding that the next moment that arises after having those thoughts will be kind of a hellish state. So it's really simple, right? Cause and effect. I do this, that happens. So this is fundamental to the teaching of the Buddha. That's pretty much what dependent origination means. With this, there is that. And with the cessation of this, there's the cessation of that. So understanding really what we're doing that causes our suffering, it requires a great deal of Sati, of remembering to do it, and a great deal of paying attention. And that would be mindfulness, but not blind mindfulness. So not just paying attention without figuring out how it works. So that I think that's the main difference between a lot of the Western meditation and noting practices and a lot of the popular mindfulness like fad is that people they're like, oh, I just have to concentrate on the breath or pay attention to what's happening. But they don't try to figure out how the Four Noble Truths work. So you're just paying attention and you're suffering, but you're not figuring anything out about the suffering. So paying attention is only one aspect to it. So you pay attention and then you learn. So it's like someone who— it's like studying. It's such a good example. If you're reading, if you're studying for a test and you're just reading each page, but you're not actually— you're like, oh, I'm studying for the test, but you read every single page and learned absolutely nothing.

**Speaker C:** It's like an athlete who goes to practice every day for years and years and years, and they think merely by going to practice they're going to get better at the sport. That's not how it works. There needs to be— there's not some magical clock somewhere counting how long you've been practicing. Yeah, the reality of it is, is that the mind is malleable, and if you do the same thing over and over again you're just going to be doing the same thing over and over again. There has to be some active effort and some investigation and some skin in the game in changing the habits of the mind, right? And now the insight practices, they do have this. Some of them do, in the sense that once you gain insight, that there is the effort to take some effort and relax and see what's happening in the mind. But a lot of them just have the idea of just relax and do nothing and just suffer. And at some point, you're going to be enlightened. At some point, something's going to click, with little direction on how to make things click. And what is important to emphasize is that there is effort necessary, that it's not just either There are two ends of the extreme. There's just the do nothing, concentrate, do that effort, and sometimes you'll be enlightened. And then there's the other end of the extreme of, oh, just don't worry, be happy, but the person's really suffering inside. That we need to recognize the hindrances and actively take the effort to throw them out. That we don't just say we're happy. We see that thought of not being happy and genuinely see it and change the mind to a satisfied state and be satisfied. And now at first when we're starting, we'll repeat these things and there'll be the thought, this isn't really happy. I'm not really happy. I'm lying to myself. So we need to find thoughts that really get us satisfied, thoughts that really scratch that itch of being satisfied, maybe some positive memory of a wholesome moment, and then start repeating that. I know some crowds talk about Metta thoughts being a place to start.

**Speaker A:** I would say, so another way to put it is it's a cost-benefit analysis of every thought, action, feeling, state of mind that we that we encounter whenever we remember. So yeah, yeah. So it's this thought. So you ask yourself, hmm, is this thought worth having? It's a good question to ask yourself. Like, what— is there any practical use to this thought? What is it doing for me? Is this thought a necessary function? Is it helping me? Is it saving me from anything? Is it Is it beneficial in any way? And then so you can really ask yourself this realistic question, and the answer is for most of them, no, it's not. So in the same way we have something that is useless and it's cluttering up our space, the simple solution to that is to just simply throw it out. And you can do this with your thoughts. So you have a thought, it's kind of a— it's not a wholesome thought, it has no practical benefit. The cost is greater than any benefit. So the rational thing to do is get rid of it. And you can do this with every action as well as thought. So cost-benefit analysis, is this action Is this speech, is it going to cause me more Dukkha than it's going to relieve? And so you get, you start to learn quick that a lot of the things that we do, the costs are much greater than the benefit that we're actually getting from them. So it's not kind of, it's not like a moral imperative. It's not like, oh, to be a good, like, you better see for yourself. Yeah, it's see for yourself, and it's not like, uh, there's not a priest judging you if you didn't do it. Um, it's none of that like religious like dogma. It's strictly cost-benefit analysis. Yes, Vedana, you've had your hand up. Um, question? Yes.

**Speaker D:** Um, what would be a good, uh, advice for someone joining an more religious Buddhism-oriented Sangha with all the problems associated with it in comparison to the Supramundane Dharma?

**Speaker A:** I personally, I've never joined like a religious Sangha group. I would just say come to me, come to this Sangha. If you're not finding real Dharma, you can find it here. So just send them my way. That's what I would say to those people.

**Speaker C:** And additionally, it might very on the core be very ordinary, but there might be some wise people there who know what's up. I visited a lot on Last Sunday, and Sunday is the popular day, it was a Cambodian wat and it was one monk and 30 or 40 laypeople. I think it was Lao, not Cambodian, Lao folks. And it was just a big party and very ordinary, very ritualistic. Giving their donations. They have these little trees with dollar bills on them and all of this sort of thing. And that monk there who's giving the speech while these lay people do all their ordinary things, I can't say whether or not he's noble or ordinary, but he could very well be noble and he just has no way or doesn't care enough to fix all these ordinary people. Or even if he tried, they might just get angry. That people are very attached to rituals. And so in the same way, if you go to an ordinary Buddhist wat of some kind, that probably most of the lay people, especially if it's Southeast Asian, that Westerners coming to Buddhism come from a different perspective than Asian folks because they've grown up in the culture. This was talked about. I was reading a little bit of Ajahn Chah's biography written by Ajahn Jayasaro, and he made the point that Western monks are a lot— he likes to have Western monks compared to Thai monks, because Thai monks, really, the water is flowing in the state of wanting to go to the the monastery and becoming a monk. The parents would be really happy. It's really good merit for them if their kids become monks, that they'll get a good rebirth or whatever is going on in their mind. They would like their son to be a monk and they're pushed. It's the exact opposite in the West, especially what, 50 years ago when a lot of like Ajahn Sumedho and that crew was becoming monks, they had to leave the UK go to Southeast Asia and become a monk, what do you think their parents thought about it? They have to put in some serious effort and intention to do that. So they're probably willing to apply themselves more and really listen to what the teacher Ajahn Chah has to say and apply it. So your original point was about how to go into these places. Go in with an open mind and investigate. And when you see, when one sees these ritualistic behaviors, not to take them as something to fear, something to be averted to, just take them as this, this appears to be some superstitious behavior. And that noble folks, wise folks are not completely opposed to superstitious behavior. They're just not attached to them. They're not clinging to them. They might still go along with this because it'll create unnecessary social friction for other folks who are attached.

**Speaker A:** Right. Yeah, I think it's a lesson.

**Speaker D:** It's a lesson in not jumping into the sea saving people who are struggling because you don't have enough— how do.

**Speaker A:** You say— like.

**Speaker D:** Those swimming rings, you know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** Lifesavers.

**Speaker D:** Lifesavers.

**Speaker C:** What we're specifically talking about here is the third fetter of Sila, Bhātā, Paramāsā, clinging to rights, rules, and rituals. And we can see this in a non-religious perspective as well, that a lot of society is just clinging to rights, rules, and rituals, superstitious things. It'll think that they think are good to do or valuable to do in some way, but they're really just doing them because they're clinging and they're superstitious. They're not investigating based on reality. And so if we try to save society from that, there's no way we're going to lose. And if we really want society to change, we're just going to be left dissatisfied.

**Speaker A:** Right. I think so if you go like the monk route, if you want to go and immerse yourself in that, there's a lot of resources. I know that definitely Dhammarato knows a lot more about that. But me personally, I'm a layperson. So I teach from a layperson's perspective. And I think the Noble Dhamma, historically has been kind of hidden away from the lay people. So I think it's good that it's kind of breaking out and to realize that you can practice the noble Dharma and not as a layperson. So you don't need to become a monk. You certainly can, and the monks, and they have a value, a real value for our society. So there is real value in a certain amount of the population going away from the family life, going away from home life, and completely just immersing themselves in the spiritual pursuit.

**Speaker C:** And this is a really good point that you make, and I think most Westerners who come to the Dharma get caught up in this, and that I need to become a monk and all of these sort of thoughts. But an ordinary way to look at it, or a world— from looking at it from a worldly perspective and a noble perspective, becoming a monk is just another profession. You wear a different outfit. Instead of making income to go buy food at the store, you get the food from people who donate it. And there are various costs or benefits and pros to different professions. And like you're mentioning, Scott, monks as a role in society can be very beneficial. It can be sort of an example for people, especially that sort of— I was listening to Bhante Karo talk about this a while ago, and Buddhadasa mentioned something similar, that the monk's ideal role in a society is an example of what is a wise, noble person. And then, and this doesn't mean that at all that by being a layperson you cannot meet this example. It's just you're living with different clothes, you find your food in different ways, and things like this. But those are merely circumstantial, logistical.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there is certainly value in sort of a life of just taking yourself out completely from the worldly winds. So if you become a monk, it's kind of like you could take complete refuge in the Sangha and in the Dhamma. Both like internally and externally. So you're not involving yourself with money. So that kind of like takes a lot of hindrances that would normally arise due to the problem of money out of the equation. So it's kind of just like a more like accelerated pursuit in the Dhamma. But not to say that it is impossible to find refuge in the Buddha, the Sangha, and the Dhamma and still be involved with the world and be involved with money. It just There's just going to be more complications that arise due to those things.

**Speaker C:** One has to have stronger mindfulness and be awake more often, whereas a monk, if you're living the life of a monk with a bunch of other wise folks, there's less to investigate. Yes, yeah, keep going.

**Speaker A:** So what I'm saying is like the end result So the end results of purifying the mind and developing a noble mind and becoming a noble yourself, the nobility is the same if you are a monk or a layperson. So it really, the world needs the world benefits from the more noble people there are. So if there's people going away to become noble with just taking out the obstacles, that's of benefit to society. It's just that as a layperson, there's maybe more apparent obstacles to becoming a.

**Speaker C:** Noble, but especially before the internet and especially before Dhamma books were widespread, that how was one going to get these teachings in the time of the Buddha without talking to monks very often?

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, right. Yeah, so now we have access to— I mean, I have— we have privileged access to a Thai forest lineage teacher that I can literally call whenever I want and, uh, get a close relationship with and close close consulting with, and that has been the main driver of my practice and my knowledge of the Dhamma. And now I just feel, as I continue to learn, I feel a sense of gratitude of paying it forward to speak about these things that are so powerful and so life-changing. Completely for free because they were spoken to me completely for free. So it has— so in, in that sense, it's secluded from money, these types of meetings. It's kind of like an oasis from the world because it only has to do with friendship. It has nothing to do with money. It has nothing to do with gain and loss, pleasure and pain. It just has completely to do with talking about the Dharma and talking about the way things are and the path leading to the cessation of suffering and the mastery of those truths and mechanics in our day-to-day lies. And it's kind of like a way of life or a way of living that takes the anxiety, the fear, the existential dread out of life because it's so reliable. So once you discover these truths for yourself through your own practice, that's kind of like what guides you. And I can't imagine this changing for the rest of my life. So there is a kind of like a safety, a security in that, in the Dhamma, a refuge, certainly. From the sways and the dangers and the worries of the world and all the Dukkha of Samsara, or the churning of the wheel. Yeah, Veda, go for it.

**Speaker D:** Are flaws in the foundation of the practice irradicable?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what do you mean by that? Are flaws in the foundation of the practice.

**Speaker D:** If people are, let's say, in something like McDonald's of Buddhism, Kadampa, something like this, and they learn stuff and they associate with this stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so they have some sort of like root misunderstanding that they've been expecting that hasn't been working. No, never mind, start again. So that can apply. Never mind, start again applies to everyone, even if you've been meditating all sorts of wrong ideas for 10 years. So that person, I would teach them just the same as someone who's never encountered any meditation practice at all. So the fact of the matter is that they've just accumulated bad habits. And misunderstandings. So someone who learns meditation wrong is the same bad habit or misunderstanding. It might be slightly better than just normal, like worldly misunderstandings, but it's the same bad habits and misunderstanding, and the way that you change it is the same. So it is impermanent and it can change. So understanding that it doesn't matter if you've been doing the same thing over and over for years and it feels like it's just intrinsic to yourself, that in and of itself is a misunderstanding about the nature of self and the nature of permanence. And that you in fact can change completely your state of mind. And you can change— no matter how deep in Dukkha you are, you can simply change it. And it is possible for anyone to change it. And you might think, oh, it's a chemical imbalance or something. You can change a chemical imbalance. So the chemicals in your brain are constantly changing, right? The brain builds new neurons. The brain can produce new pathways. The brain. So even if you think about it from a scientific point of view, the chemicals in your brain can change. And it is top-down processing. So it is kind of like an internal family system of the adult waking up to these things and nurturing from the top down and leading the way so that the more like instinctual, like childlike mechanisms of our minds and our feeling systems are reorganized and reprogrammed by the adult of your mind. So the one who wakes up to what's going on, who looks, wait a second, this isn't wholesome, and the one who can see, who can discern, the one who can discern what is and isn't wholesome is sort of the inner adult that can change the deeply rooted patterns that we may have developed or acquired. So it is possible for anyone to do this at any stage, any level, any progress, any any part of your life. Because it is— the brain is impermanent, and it can develop new pathways, and it can heal itself, and it can change the chemical balance in your brain. You can hack the system to be producing more dopamine and more serotonin, if you want to think about it that way, simply through how we breathe, how we breathe and how we think. Change how we breathe, it literally changes our chemistry. And change how we think, it changes our neural pathways as well. And they're doing a lot of studies on this, the scientific studies on people who haven't attained to meditative feats or being able to enter meditative states. And they're looking at what does the brain look like for these types of people and what's the differences from a normal state or a more unpleasant state. And I think there's there's some cool stuff that's probably going to come out of that. But the point is that everything about the body and the brain and the self is constantly changing every moment, and it's never the same. It's always in a flux. Everything is impermanent, so nothing is ever doomed to be a certain way. That's a misconception about the way we are, the natural law of reality, how reality functions.

**Speaker C:** That one can develop an attitude of, I have no free will, I can't do anything about this, it's a chemical imbalance, these sort of thoughts. And there might be some truth to some of them, but the point of it is that it's a narrative and that I encourage anyone who has these thoughts to investigate it, to play with it, see if there's any holding on to this narrative. What does it feel like to let it go and change the narrative for a little bit? Change the narrative to, I can do this, even if it feels completely out of the ordinary that you can't do this. Yeah, try to play around with it, right? Just a hypothesis.

**Speaker A:** I mean, what do you have to lose to to try thinking about things differently. Thinking, yeah, I can do it, I can change. And the thing is that the only reason you can't change is because you think you can't. And you can't change if you think you can't. It's simple cause and effect. So just understanding that it's the internal processing that makes us suffer, not what actually happens, is the main thing. So there is a stimulus, and then there is the processing of that stimulus. And the processing is where where there may be unskillful interpretations. So everyone is going to experience Dukkha. The fact that they're alive, that means that they're going to experience Dukkha. That's the first noble truth. We're on a cycle of birth and rebirth. Here in this life. And then the way that we interpret Dukkha, or the way that we understand Dukkha, is going to either disallow the discovery of the other Noble Truths past the first one, or just keep you at the first noble truth of, yeah, this sucks and I'm suffering. So if we interpret things like, like, yeah, like a lot of people think that that's what the Buddha taught, is that all life is suffering and there's like every, all of it suffering. But no, actually Sukkha is the opposite of Dukkha. And Sukkha is a skill to be developed. So it has been developed by other people, and you can do it too. Firsthand experience, I've developed the skill through the practice of the Dharma to literally experience more sensations, like real sensations of comfort and real sensations of relaxation. And happiness. And then out of that, uplifted joy arises. So, so sort of like sometimes even rapturous. So just enlivening stuff. It's like the juice, the stuff that exhilarates you, the stuff that makes you feel alive, the stuff that feels like new life, feels like youth, feels like spring. And that is another skill and another aspect of the practice. And then all of this stuff is impermanent. And then you come into even more tranquil states of mind and develop even more insight about how the mind functions because you're not wasting all this time griping to yourself and having a pity party. So like once you stop wasting all that time with your internal pity party or griping, you can actually see clearly what's going on from a kind of unbiased perspective. Just completely completely rid of barriers or unaffected by any likes or dislikes. So you can see how it is instead of liking it or disliking it. And when you see how it is, you're just going to understand the Four Noble Truths even that much more. So you understand the Arisal of Dukkha and the cessation of it and how these two things come into being or come in.

**Speaker C:** Your original thing was about the foundations of practice. And if they are off, can one develop the practice correctly? It might be helpful to talk about what actually are the foundations of practice, because that would help with understanding how they develop correctly. And by that definition, we can look at a sort of practice, and if it meets those foundations, then yes, and otherwise no. I'd say that probably the most simple way of looking at it is, one, waking up, becoming aware, looking, seeing what's going on, and two, the effort of letting go and there's the booger on the finger. Now you see it, you need to flick it off because it's sticky. There needs to be some effort in flicking the booger off. And so those two things, the waking up to wanting to type the email and being scared of what if I don't send this email right now, I need to do it, and letting go of I don't need to send the email right now, I can be satisfied right now, and maybe I can go send the email because I think it's a wise thing to do and I can do so happily. But the need, the thirst, the craving for sending the email isn't there anymore. And so that's the practice. Sending the email is one example of a thought that many people can relate to, but there are even grosser things and even more subtle things as one develops a skill of flicking the booger off their finger.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so there's obvious unwholesome thoughts and then there's unwholesome thoughts that kind of slip under the radar, or they go unnoticed to the untrained mind because it seems like a run-of-the-mill thought. Like, it's like if you were cleaning.

**Speaker C:** The bathroom and when you're cleaning a sink, there's sort of crevices of dirt and you need like a toothbrush or something special to get in there because the rag won't do it enough. There's like that, those dirt in those areas So there needs to be extra effort, and we need to be extra aware to clean out those dirty areas, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so yeah, like, I'm trying to come up with just like a practical example of an unwholesome thought that might not seem unwholesome at first, like like, oh, I got to do this tomorrow. So like thinking that thought, it doesn't help you do the thing that you need to do tomorrow. It's kind of just a thought that comes up that kind of makes you feel restless or anxious. So it has no utility. It's unwholesome. Where you may be reminiscing about a past relationship or something, and you think, oh, I'm just like appreciating the good times, but you're really— you're thinking about something that isn't here. So you're fabricating a narrative, you're fabricating a memory of this person that isn't even that person. That's a good example. It's like, it may seem like wholesome, like maybe like you're appreciating something about that person, But really, you're bringing up old emotions, you're bringing up craving, and you're bringing up all sorts of stuff that prevents you from being satisfied right now and right here. Because in actuality, that person isn't in this room. So Thinking about them is kind of just fabricating an idea of them rather than that actual person, the experience of that person. So this is a good way to approach life, to have a completely existentially unfabricated view of life. So you don't think about things that aren't there, is another way to put it. All that there is is this experience happening right now. And there's only these people on this phone appearing in my hands. And there's only this room as I experience it right now. And anything else is going to be a present experience, but it's going to be a fabricated concept about past or future experiences, which is arising in the moment. But we forget that it is just a fabrication, that it isn't actually the real thing. The real thing is all that the real thing will ever be is this. So to come into to really come into the experience of now and start to enjoy it, you know. And most of the time what prevents you from enjoying it or prevents you from finding some relief in it is worrying about and thinking about things that aren't there. Is almost 100% of the time what prevents you from just relaxing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the classic Dhammarato line of there are no alligators on the floor, there are no mafia bosses knocking at your door. Yeah, there's nothing that is an imminent threat to you right now that is worth being scared of. Yes, whether or not anything is worth being scared of or not, that's a different question. Right now in your immediate vicinity, there is nothing dangerous to you. Yet we still feel scared, we still feel that danger.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so once you wake up to that, is that there's no danger here, now you're just left with the hindrances that you have in this moment. Maybe you're bored, this is boring, or that's kind of restlessness. Maybe some sort of you feel sluggish, you feel tired, you don't feel very awake. That's sloth and torpor. And then all these hindrances, now that we've actually gotten down to the real problem, because we stopped proliferating about all these other problems, we've gotten down to the real problem of I feel dissatisfied right now in this moment. Now we can deal with it. Now we can start to change it and practice to change it. So yeah, it's not just about coming into the now. Which a lot of teachers might teach. It's about coming to the now, and then now that we're in the now, we can see what's really the roots of our dissatisfaction rather than thinking it's something else that's causing us dissatisfaction. We can see sloth and torpor, we can see restlessness, we can see craving and aversion right now. And we can start to— not just.

**Speaker C:** Seeing what triggers us, seeing the things that the words like in psychology is used often of triggers, right? These things that we really don't like and they get us up in a state of fear and distress and trigger trauma. That Buddhism is not just seeing them and becoming aware of them, it's about actively taking the effort to decondition them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So that's why people stay in it.

**Speaker D:** That'S why people stay in their in their conditioning because they don't have proof for that it could be different. I'm sorry guys, I have to go. Thank you very much.

**Speaker C:** All right, it's always great seeing you.

**Speaker D:** Have a good time. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Bye. Yeah, so, um, uh, to, uh, wake up to the moment and then, and then actively change the dissatisfaction that we're experiencing. There's tools, there's ways, there's options. There's a lot of different options. So it is kind of like sports, practicing a sport. Like, what do you do? You strengthen your weaknesses and you take advantage of your strengths. So you really use your strength to your advantage, and then you become aware of the weak points, and you strengthen them at those points. It's the same way with experiencing more pleasure in the body, more wholesome thoughts. We see where the problem is rather than just thinking all of it's the problem. We find the problem and we change it specifically and surgically. And then we keep doing that. And at first it may be, oh, there's a problem. You may be like you're playing whack-a-mole. It just keeps popping up.

**Speaker C:** That's a great analogy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, so, uh, but, uh, you know, how did you got— you just get good at playing whack-a-mole and you got it there, got that one, got that one, and then, um, you become really good at whack-a-mole. And, uh, so you develop the skill irrespective of how many, um, hindrances are.

**Speaker C:** Popping up and really celebrating when you whack that mole.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, you find joy in it, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Starts to become, yes, I got that one. Yes, I got that one. So yeah, you're having a good time and you're actually enjoying yourself. So I think that's a good note to end it on unless you have any other thing to bring up. That's great.

**Speaker C:** As always, everyone's invited to come join. Just a bunch of friends informally chatting. Brothers and sisters in old age, sickness, and death. Everyone's welcome, whether beginner or expert or whatever. Just come and join and hang out. We're just a bunch of friendly friends.

**Speaker A:** All right, man. Well, it was good seeing you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, great seeing you, Scott.

**Speaker A:** See you next time.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Scott)** and involving several Sangha friends, is an informal, practical discussion focused on applying the Buddha's core teachings to everyday life. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Dhamma as a Practical Lens for Life**
The talk emphasizes that the Noble Dhamma is not a separate activity but a framework for understanding *all* experience. The goal is to shift from seeing practice as a hobby to making it a continuous mindfulness of the present moment, using the Dhamma to "reprogram" deeply ingrained habits of mind that cause suffering.

### **Main Discussion Points:**

1.  **Dhamma vs. Ontology:** The Buddha's teaching is distinguished from other religions/philosophies. It is not an **ontology** (a theory about the ultimate nature of reality). Instead, it is a pragmatic, **experiential path** focused solely on understanding suffering (Dukkha) and its end. The Dhamma is like discovering natural laws through cause and effect within one's own experience.

2.  **The Essence of Practice: The Four Noble Truths & Cause/Effect:** All Dhamma discussion ultimately relates to the Four Noble Truths. The practice involves a continuous **"cost-benefit analysis"** of thoughts, speech, and actions. One learns to see that unwholesome thoughts (e.g., rumination, anger, worry) have a high "cost" (suffering) and little to no real benefit, so the rational response is to let them go.

3.  **Active Investigation, Not Passive Mindfulness:** A key critique is made of popular "mindfulness" that merely notes experience without investigation. True practice requires **active effort and investigation** to understand the mechanics of suffering and happiness. It's compared to an athlete who must intentionally train to improve, not just show up.

4.  **The "How-To": From Waking Up to "Whack-a-Mole":** The practical method is broken down:
    *   **First, wake up** to the present moment. Recognize that immediate, actual danger is rare ("no alligators on the floor"), so current dissatisfaction stems from internal hindrances, not external threats.
    *   **Then, actively change** the dissatisfied state. This involves identifying specific hindrances (sloth, restlessness, aversion) and skillfully applying antidotes (e.g., cultivating wholesome thoughts, relaxation, satisfaction). The process is playfully compared to **"whack-a-mole"**—celebrating the skill of spotting and releasing each unwholesome state as it arises.

5.  **Lay Practice vs. Monasticism:** The talk affirms that the **Noble Dhamma is fully accessible to laypeople**. While monastic life removes certain worldly obstacles and has societal value, nobility (awakening) is the same for both monastics and laypeople. The modern advantage of accessible teachers (like Dhammarato) and Sanghas online makes deep practice possible from home.

6.  **Addressing Flaws and Deep Conditioning:** In response to a question, the speakers strongly affirm that **no one is irreparably stuck**. Even long-standing "flaws" or wrong practices are just deep habits. Because all phenomena (including brain chemistry and neural pathways) are **impermanent and malleable**, change is always possible through top-down, intentional retraining of the mind.

7.  **Warning Against Ritual/Religious Clinging:** The group cautions about confusing cultural Buddhism or ritualistic adherence (the fetter of "clinging to rites and rituals") with the supramundane Dhamma. The advice is to engage with any Sangha with an open but investigative mind, focusing on the core principles of suffering and its end.

### **Overall Tone & Purpose:**
The talk is **informal, encouraging, and pragmatic**. It aims to demystify the Dhamma, presenting it as a reliable, life-changing skill set for finding refuge from anxiety and dissatisfaction. The Sangha is framed as a free, friendly space for mutual support among "brothers and sisters in old age, sickness, and death," united in practicing the path to the end of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and analogies to explain Buddhist (Dhamma) concepts. Here are the key ones:

**1.  The Lens / Target Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** The Dhamma as a **lens** through which to examine all things, or as a **target** that all things can point toward.
*   **Use:** Introduces the idea that any topic can be discussed from the perspective of the Noble Dhamma, as it pertains to the fundamental nature of reality.

**2.  The Study / Athlete Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** Meditation practice as **studying for a test** (just reading pages without learning) or as an **athlete going to practice** without intentional effort to improve.
*   **Use:** Critiques passive "mindfulness" or meditation that lacks active investigation and effort to change mental habits. Emphasizes that mere repetition without insight and skillful effort doesn't lead to progress.

**3.  Cost-Benefit Analysis Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** Evaluating thoughts and actions as a **cost-benefit analysis**.
*   **Use:** Frameworks the practice as a pragmatic, rational assessment: Is this thought/action useful? Does it cause more suffering (*dukkha*) than it relieves? The "rational thing to do" with a costly thought is to "throw it out," like discarding useless clutter.

**4.  The Adult and Child / Internal Family System Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** The mind's structure as having an **inner adult** (the discerning, wise awareness) that can nurture and reprogram the **instinctual, childlike mechanisms** (deeply rooted habits and feelings).
*   **Use:** Explains how even deep-seated patterns can be changed through top-down, wise intervention from the awakened part of consciousness.

**5.  Cleaning Metaphors (Bathroom & Booger)**
*   *Bathroom Cleaning:* The practice as **cleaning a sink**, where some dirt is in crevices and needs special tools (extra awareness and effort) to reach.
*   *The Booger:* A hindrance or unwholesome thought as a **booger on your finger**—once you see it (mindfulness), you need to make the effort to "flick it off" (let it go).
*   **Use:** Illustrates that some mental defilements are obvious, while others are subtle and require more refined skill to address. Both stress that awareness must be followed by active release.

**6.  The Whack-a-Mole Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** Dealing with hindrances as playing **whack-a-mole**.
*   **Use:** Describes the process of repeatedly encountering and skillfully "whacking down" unwholesome mental states as they arise. The goal is to get good at the game and even find joy in the skill of dispelling them.

**7.  The Oasis Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** The Sangha (spiritual community) and Dhamma discussion as an **oasis from the world**.
*   **Use:** Contrasts the space of Dhamma friendship—free from worldly concerns of gain/loss, pleasure/pain—with the normal "churning wheel" of *samsara* (cyclic existence). It represents a refuge.

**8.  The Profession / Clothing Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** Being a monk as just another **profession** with different **clothes** and a different method of obtaining food (alms vs. salary).
*   **Use:** Demystifies monasticism. It argues that nobility (enlightenment) is the same for monastics and laypeople; the difference is in lifestyle logistics and the number of obstacles, not the ultimate goal.

**9.  The Lifesaver / Swimming Ring Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** Trying to correct others' superstitious rituals without being asked as jumping in to save struggling swimmers without enough **lifesavers** or **swimming rings**.
*   **Use:** Advises caution against forcefully trying to "save" people attached to religious rituals, as it can create social friction and is often futile.

**10. The "No Alligators" Story**
*   **Reference:** A classic line from their teacher, Dhammarato: **"There are no alligators on the floor, no mafia bosses knocking at your door."**
*   **Use:** A vivid, humorous story to point out that our fear and anxiety are often fabrications. In the immediate present moment, there is usually no imminent physical threat, yet we feel scared—highlighting that the problem is internal processing, not external reality.

**Core Narrative Underpinning the Talk:**
The entire discussion is framed by a **pragmatic, problem-solving narrative**. The Dhamma is presented not as a metaphysical ontology but as a **practical toolkit** for ending suffering. The central story is one of **awakening to the present moment, diagnosing the actual root of dissatisfaction (the hindrances), and then actively applying effort to surgically change one's mental state**—moving from a life driven by deluded habits to one of increasing wisdom, skill, and genuine happiness.
