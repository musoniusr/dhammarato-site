### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, I just turned the video on. Here's the question about that, and that is, is that why would you ever make a choice to sit in pain or to lay in pain when you have the possibility of adjusting your posture so you don't? Here's an example of that. The kid broke his arm, his right arm. He's right-handed. The doctor put his arm in a cast, then he put it into a sling. And now the kid, with that sling, is playing with coffee, he's writing stuff down, and he's doing all kinds of things, and his arm hurts. The whole point about putting it in a sling, if the doctor would explain it to him, is to keep the arm still, which means keep his hand still. If you keep your hand moving, all of the tendons way up into the arm— look at, if you can see, When I'm moving my hand, look at all of the muscles that are moving in the arm. Okay, so the thing to do is to rest the hand so that you can rest the arm so that it can heal. You understand that much? Okay, so you can adjust your posture and sometimes you can stop doing what makes the back hurt. One example was that I saw myself and a lot of other students would try to get against the wall when we were doing the Anicca, the Vipassana retreats, and the staff would come and say, don't sit against the wall, don't be comfortable, sit out there and be in pain. Okay, one of the things that happens when you're sitting against the wall is by sitting against the wall and pressing against the wall, guess what? It straightens the spine. So that you're not slumped over. And then when people are in pain, they slump over. So get into a chair that's got a back to it and sit up straight and use that backrest to hold your back straight. You can also practice while laying down in bed, laying on your side. Find a posture where your back is not hurting. And then congratulate yourself for finding a posture where your back doesn't hurt.

**Speaker B:** So it's like I have to do a lot of introspection to know which things I can change in order to make me feel better, like my body, and which stuff I cannot change, kind of.

**Speaker A:** All right, yes. So now let's say that you've done everything that I advise and also done other things. Like in Thailand, they have a thing called massage. And at one time my neck hurt, and the worst thing that I could possibly do was to go to a Thai masseur and have them moving everything around. It's like a chiropractor or Reiki. Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't. So be mindful if you're having an adjustment by either a chiropractor or masseuse or someone like that to try to alleviate the back pain. Pain because sometimes they can't alleviate the back pain and sometimes they make it even worse. So now with all of that, with doing body postures, changing your posture, also going and getting your back worked on, you still have chronic back pain. That's possible. Yeah, then in fact there's a thing that's called osteoporosis. Have you ever heard of that?

**Speaker B:** It's like chronic inflammation, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, the symptoms that can be seen from the outside is the old woman is stooped over and she's got a cane. Okay. But you can tell that she's in pain when she walks because the cartilage and the calcium in her spine are no longer working correctly. And so she's bent over. Sometimes people get bent over double. Hmm. All right. And they have chronic pain. The question is, are you going to be in chronic back pain and chronic mental pain together? Are you going to just merely manage chronic back pain and be mentally happy? It is possible that you cannot do something about the back pain, but we want to exhaust all the possibilities that you can do something physically to eliminate the physical pain. But in the United States, what they do is, if they can't— even if they can fix the actual physical back pain, they still want to take pills. And all the pills that they have for back pain are based on opium. Yeah, that in fact is kind of like using heroin as a cure for back pain. And more than likely what's going to happen is people are going to be addicted to their back pain medicine. Yeah, because the medicine itself makes the pain less. But it also ruins their life through addiction. So I would not recommend any medication in pill form, though I do know that some medications are valuable and wholesome. An example of that is aloe is a good aid for burns and open wounds. Also, if you've got an open wound, getting it stitched up in one of the new methods or one of the old methods— you can either use staples or some of the newer stuff— is that if you've got an open cut on the arm here that you put tape over here and tape over here. This got a way of stitching the tape so that you can draw that wound closed. Yeah, without stitches. Yeah, that you stitch the tape that you've got rather than stitching the wound itself. So there's a lot of stuff that the doctors would recommend that have to do with physical. Another one is, is if you've got a broken arm, let's set it in the cast. And I've got some new casts that are really interesting because they have new casts that are made out of plastic or so that allow it to breathe. And the old way, they would wrap it in gauze and then put it completely covered with plaster of Paris. But that's the old way to do it. Now they can put it into a cast. In fact, one of the ways of putting it into a cast is like a balloon around it. And when you blow up a balloon, the balloon will hold the arm still. But it's got— the balloon is built in such a way that it allows air to get in and moisture, whatever, like that. So you can take a bath and all kinds of things with the new cast. But the important thing is, is that you are doing something to hold that arm still so that it can heal.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So, all right, so we do want to take care of the physical stuff. First and do as much as we can with the technology that we have. And there's still going to be then the issue of, well, what's next? The answer is not pills, but the answer is let's have some medication to fix the mind. Like, like when the pain comes, we can say, all right, let's do it two ways. One is, is that the pain comes because you're using that part of the body And so the thing to do is to stop using it and let it rest.

**Speaker B:** So that's back to the physical. The meditation for the mind is the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but it takes, uh, it takes the Dharma to remember you've got to stop doing that. Yeah, just like the kid has to remember that he's got, he's got to stop using that hand, he's got to stop drink holding coffee cups, he's got to stop writing with that hand, he's got to stop trying to catch baseballs, he's got to stop using that hand because the arm's not going to heal. So that takes Dhamma to remember to hold the hand still.

**Speaker B:** So if I understand correctly, you can have sometimes physical pain, you can sometimes alleviate some physical pain, sometimes you can't.

**Speaker A:** Most of the time you can.

**Speaker B:** Most of the time You can, but it's about not getting also into mental pain due to that physical pain.

**Speaker A:** And so now the next thing to remember is that the pain is going to be there, but you can be a champion of that pain. You do not have to be its victim. You can remember that, oh, I can't hold that arm still, is the first thing, but that may not do it. But now you can say, I can hold my mind still rather than having my mind become agitated because I'm in pain. Yeah, I can hold my mind still. I do not have to have the mind running into hating the pain. I can deal with it. I can handle it. So now we've got a new word to use: I can handle that pain.

**Speaker B:** So, but it still needs like the wisdom to know when I cannot change it and I just have to accept it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the wisdom would be how much work are you going to put into the physical, because in fact the physical changes that need to be done to get rid of the pain may be a long, slow process. But you can do something immediately about the mind. In other words, if you step on a nail and you've got a punctured foot, you do want to go to the doctor. He's going to give you a tetanus shot. He's going to— if the nail is still in the foot, he's going to pull it out. If it's not there, he's going to bind the wound and put some medicine on it. But on the way to the doctor, you don't have to be miserable with your foot. You're gonna say, I can handle this. The doctor's going to take care of it. Let him do the physical stuff, and I'm going to do the middle, uh, the mental thing. I'm not going to work— worry about it. I'm going to stay off that foot. I'm not going to try to walk on it. I'm going to be careful and be, uh, gentle with it. Get myself into a wheelchair, roll myself into the doctor's office, and let him deal with the foot while I'm dealing with my mind happily.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, so it's kind of learning where the point is of stopping. Also, it kind of— you always say, uh, you take the, like, the fastest, fastest way to get rid of the suffering, like the easiest, right?

**Speaker A:** So in fact, Arahant, how sharp that sensation is in the broken arm or how sharp the pain is in the back that's got osteoporosis, or how much pain you're in because you've got a nail just driven into your foot. It doesn't matter those sensations. They're not the suffering. The suffering is not liking that sensation, and part of it has to do with fear. Like, you can break a leg and the sports kid will say, oh, I'll never play football again. Well, he doesn't know that. All right, so I'll never be able to walk again is the fear part. And the better part of that would be— the better mental states would be— is I can handle this, whatever happens. Yeah, I may not walk again, but I bet I can. And if I can't, I can handle that too. So always the attitude is the attitude of a winner. I can handle this pain. I can handle it. In fact, it doesn't have to be called pain. It's just a sensation. Even better, call it a bodily message. For instance, the kid whose arm hurts because it's broken and in a cast, that's a message saying, hold your hand still. And so when the arm starts to hurt, the kid says, aha, let me hold my hand still because it makes my arm hurt when I'm playing with my hand.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks for that. I will— it's kind of something that has been coming up lately.

**Speaker A:** And all right, here's one thing I noticed, that your shoulders are higher than your neck. You're up like this right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm like leaning on the, on the table, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that'll make some people to have their back hurt. Relax, bring your shoulders down. And in fact, that's a major cause of back pain for so many people. They don't even know it, that they've got their arms propped up on a table. And that makes her back hurt.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So another thing, because I've been like yesterday, I've been on a train for 5 hours.

**Speaker A:** That'll make your butt hurt.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's not at all about physical pain, but more like boredom. That's been really interesting.

**Speaker A:** So the boredom is that you just simply don't like the situation, and maybe there is some butt pain and you're not even looking at it. So perhaps the thing to do is to unstrap that buckle, stand up, walk up and down the hall, maybe only 3 or 4 feet in one direction, turn around, walk down 3 or 4 feet twice, and then turn around and then walk 3 or 4 feet back to the chair.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. It's like one thing I've noticed a lot, like yesterday, was that I really could see how my mind was craving like mental, like stimulation, like dopamine, dopamine.

**Speaker A:** Everybody does that. That's why they put a book magazine in the back pocket of every flight that sells something, and they put in really interesting nifty stuff that you'll only see on your airplane. And so they wind up people spending a whole lot of money because they're bored.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And I was wondering, like, What is the correct view when I notice it?

**Speaker A:** Oh, they've got pretty pictures. Wow, when I'm looking at the pretty pictures, I don't hurt so much. I'm not so bored, but I'm not going to buy anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I was wondering at this 5-hour train ride, I was wondering, like, I could not Like, it was hard for me to, for example, just sit all the time. So I sometimes— So stand up and.

**Speaker A:** Then sit back down. People will in fact sit, they don't like sitting, they hate sitting, and they'll still stay sitting. They don't actually do something. They don't stand up and let the butt rest and then sit back down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Walk around the car, walk to the next car, then walk back and come back to your seat and sit down.

**Speaker B:** So it's kind of like doing some stuff to stimulate my brain a little bit.

**Speaker A:** And then one of the best things to stimulate your brain with is start thinking about the Dhamma. Get your cell phone out and start looking for quotes from the Dhammapada.

**Speaker B:** I really love listening to Dhamma talks.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so get them out and start listening. And while you're listening to Dhamma talk, your butt doesn't hurt so much on the train.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's funny that sometimes I listen to a talk for like an hour and then I notice, well, it's getting boring. And this is interesting feeling.

**Speaker A:** So go listen to another one. Go to a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movie. Go to Buster Keaton. And when their comedy gets boring, then go and watch, oh, what's his name? Clint Eastwood shoot somebody in a Western movie. And when you get tired of the violence, go back and start watching the Dharma again. It's okay to move things around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right.

**Speaker A:** You don't get bored.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that's what I need to contemplate about, because I noticed that I have this view of boredom being kind of, or needing that stimulation, being like demonizing it in a way.

**Speaker A:** Rather than just merely recognizing that, hey, I'm bored, which means, hey, I need stimulation. Or, hey, I can change my mind. I can stimulate my own mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** And there's two ways to do it. Guess which one I recommend? One way to do it is to sit there and hate Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. And then the other way to do it is to love the Dharma. Wow, the Dharma is so great. If I think about the Dharma, I don't hurt so much. If I'm listening to the Dharma Or if I'm thinking about the Dharma, then I'm not so bored.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I really love listening to when there are like new talks coming up with people that like where you talk with for the first time. I really love listening to those because you kind of, you explain the Dharma from the beginning in simple and yeah, it makes me, it reminds me a lot. So I really like these like simple talks where you talk to someone for the first time and just explain to them what it's all about, him or her?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's actually quite simple. The big trick is, can you remember that it's simple and then do it? It's a simple thing to do, but people will often do their old habits in the sense that they'll get bored and they'll stay bored and they hate the boredom and they don't remember that, hey, I can come right out of boredom by giving myself something to do. Like thinking about the Dharma, thinking about how marvelous it is, thinking about how absolutely spot on the Buddha was 2,500 years ago.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that he's got a cure and the psychiatrists don't even have a cure yet. All they've got is pills.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** They don't have a cure for the spiritual disease, but we do have a cure for it. What is that cure? Never mind, I can handle that. It's not a big deal. Everything's going to be okay. Nothing to worry about. This train trip is going to be over. Hey, while the train trip's happening, why don't I do something valuable and wholesome, like look out the window and see all the stuff passing by? Trains are really nice when you can see things going by. It's actually more boring at night because you can't see anything at night.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Also, like recently, recently I've been getting a lot of confidence in the Dharma because I feel like when I notice Dukkha, I really have this deep knowledge that it's illusionary.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. You made it up. All your boredom, you made that up.

**Speaker B:** Right, so, and I know that the Dhamma, like, no matter what I suffer from, the Dharma can get me out of it, kind of.

**Speaker A:** Because you got yourself into it, you using the Dhamma can get yourself right back out of it.

**Speaker B:** Right, so it's this teaching of no matter what happens, I have the Dhamma, or I can handle it.

**Speaker A:** All right, think of it like this. That, uh, think of it like a hammer, a standard claw hammer. You use the hammerhead to drive in all of that Dukkha. Yeah, but you could use the claw to pull it right back out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. So you mean like Using the mind in creating Dukkha, but also being able to use the mind in releasing it.

**Speaker A:** Pull that Dukkha right back out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what it feels like learning more and more about the Dharma and about myself, obviously.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and when you use the claw on that hammer to pull those nails out, now those boards are not stuck together anymore. You've got freedom. Yeah, if you leave that nail stuck in place, you're stuck.

**Speaker B:** And how amazing that is to being able to do that.

**Speaker A:** So let's use the claw part of our mind and just pull that stuff right out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe that should be the title for the YouTube video: Use the Claw to Pull It Right Out. Yeah, nice. Thanks a lot.

**Speaker A:** All right, great. Well, we've gotten a lot done today. Thank you for your help on Google, and I appreciate it. And, uh, my payment to you is Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** I did not get very far already.

**Speaker A:** You take your time. I'm not in a hurry. They've been billing us for months and months, and I haven't done anything about it. So if you can do something about it, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we'll see. I will look— I will look into it. Maybe, maybe it's— maybe it's quick and easy. We'll see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it should be quick and easy for you if you can read Google stuff. It's hard for me because I have to squint for every word.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Wish you a great day. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and dialogue between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: Managing Physical Pain and Mental Suffering with Wisdom**
The talk uses the analogy of a child with a broken arm to illustrate a central principle: **first, do everything sensible and possible to address the physical cause of pain, but then use Dhamma to prevent that pain from becoming mental suffering.**

### **Key Points:**

1.  **Address the Physical Cause First:** The initial and wise response to pain is to investigate and alleviate its physical source. Examples given include:
    *   Adjusting posture (using a chair with back support, not slumping).
    *   Resting the injured part (like keeping a broken arm still to heal).
    *   Seeking appropriate physical remedies (massage, chiropractic, modern medical casts).
    *   The goal is to exhaust reasonable physical solutions before resigning to chronic pain.

2.  **The Danger of Pills as a First Resort:** A warning is given against immediately turning to opioid-based pain medications, which risk addiction and only mask the problem without addressing the root cause or the mental reaction.

3.  **Separate Physical Sensation from Mental Suffering:** This is the core Dhamma teaching. **Pain (physical sensation) is not the same as suffering (mental anguish).**
    *   Suffering arises from the mind's reaction: aversion, fear, hatred, or boredom toward the sensation.
    *   The physical message of pain (e.g., "hold your hand still") can be acknowledged without adding a layer of mental misery.

4.  **The Attitude of a Champion:** Cultivate the mindset: **"I can handle this."** Instead of being a victim to pain or boredom, one can choose to be a champion who manages their mental state. The advice is to meet unpleasant sensations with stability and non-aversion.

5.  **Applying This to Boredom & Mental Discomfort:** The same principle applies to mental states like boredom on a long train ride.
    *   **First, address the "physical" need:** Change your posture, stand up, walk around.
    *   **Then, address the mind skillfully:** Recognize boredom as a craving for stimulation. Skillfully provide wholesome stimulation—like listening to Dhamma talks, contemplating teachings, or appreciating the scenery—instead of getting caught in aversion or unwholesome distractions.

6.  **The Dhamma as the Tool for Mental Freedom:** The talk emphasizes that the Dhamma is the ultimate tool for this work.
    *   It provides the wisdom to know what can be changed (physical posture, activity) and what must be accepted (chronic pain, a long ride).
    *   It gives the method to "pull out" suffering just as one hammered it in. By changing our relationship to experience, we can find freedom *within* the experience.
    *   Confidence grows with the realization that **"I made this suffering up, and using the Dhamma, I can get myself out of it."**

### **Practical Advice Highlighted:**
*   For back pain: Check if you're raising your shoulders; relax them down.
*   For boredom: Change your activity, move your body, and deliberately engage the mind with wholesome Dhamma reflections.
*   General rule: Take the fastest, easiest way to reduce suffering—which often starts with a simple physical adjustment, followed by a mental shift.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a practical guide to **wise self-care**. It encourages actively caring for the body while simultaneously training the mind not to create secondary suffering. The ultimate message is one of empowerment: through the Dhamma, we can learn to "handle" any experience with grace, separating the raw sensation from the self-inflicted narrative of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Metaphor of the Hammer and Nail**
*   **The Hammerhead:** Represents the mind creating suffering (dukkha) by "driving in" negative thoughts and reactions.
*   **The Claw:** Represents the mind, using Dhamma (the teachings), as a tool to extract or undo that suffering. The key lesson is that the same mind that creates the problem can also be used to solve it, leading to freedom ("the boards are not stuck together anymore").

**2. The Story of the Kid with a Broken Arm**
*   This is an extended analogy for dealing with physical and mental pain. The kid's arm in a sling represents an injury that needs healing. His continued use of the hand, causing pain, represents our habitual reactions that exacerbate suffering. The lesson is twofold:
    *   **Physical Level:** Sometimes you must stop the activity causing pain (rest the hand/arm) to allow healing.
    *   **Mental/Dhamma Level:** You need mindfulness ("Dhamma to remember") to stop the habitual mental or physical patterns that cause or worsen suffering.

**3. The Metaphor of Pain as a "Bodily Message"**
*   Physical pain (e.g., the broken arm hurting) is reframed not as pure suffering, but as a useful signal or "message." The message instructs a change in behavior (e.g., "hold your hand still"). This shifts the relationship with pain from one of aversion to one of practical understanding.

**4. The Story of the Long Train Ride (Boredom)**
*   This serves as a real-time, relatable story about mental discomfort (boredom, craving for stimulation). It illustrates that the principle of handling physical pain applies to mental pain as well. The solutions offered (changing posture, walking, shifting focus to Dhamma, etc.) demonstrate practical application of the teaching.

**5. The Contrasting Metaphors: Champion vs. Victim & "I Can Handle It"**
*   **Champion vs. Victim:** You can choose to be a "champion" of your pain (managing it with a strong, capable mind) rather than its "victim" (being overwhelmed by it).
*   **"I Can Handle It":** This repeated phrase acts as a mantra or mental stance, representing the empowered attitude developed through Dhamma practice. It is presented as the direct antidote to the fear and aversion that constitute true suffering.

**6. The Medical Comparison Metaphor**
*   **Modern Medicine (Pills):** Portrayed as a potentially addictive, superficial fix that addresses only the symptom (like using opium/heroin for back pain) and can "ruin a life."
*   **Dhamma:** Portrayed as the true "cure for the spiritual disease" that psychiatrists lack. It addresses the root cause of suffering in the mind. This metaphor elevates Dhamma from a philosophy to an essential medicine for the mind.

**Summary:** The talk uses the **hammer/claw metaphor** as a central, powerful image for the mind's dual capacity to create and liberate from suffering. The **broken arm story** provides a concrete, extended analogy for the core principle. These are supported by smaller metaphors (pain as a message, champion/victim) and real-life stories (the train ride) to make the teachings on managing physical sensation and mental reaction deeply practical and relatable.
