### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, so as I was just saying, people in the West go to Westerners to find out about Buddhism, and the Westerners never found out about Buddhism in the first place. That some of the most famous teachers didn't spend hardly a year in Asia, and they're missing out on a major key ingredient. And that key ingredient that's missing is part of the Eightfold Noble Path, and that is to make a change, the right noble effort to change. That's why it's going to be a lifestyle change, but we're not changing a lifestyle, we're changing what's happening in this very moment. Moment by moment by moment. And if you change this moment over and over and over again, that will reflect eventually in a lifestyle change. But Westerners would rather read books and talk and discuss and think about it without actually taking the right effort to make a change.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That's the key point. And so what is the change? Is to change the thoughts that we're having right in this moment. So in fact, there are three primary ingredients for the Eightfold Noble Path. The first three ingredients are to remember to do this. To remember to be present moment, to remember to look at what you're thinking, to look at what you're doing, to look at what the body is doing, to look at how you're feeling, to look at what kind of thoughts that you have, and to look at what kind of mind attitude or mind state, the sort of attitude do you have. And that almost all Westerners start off with the attitude of a victim. Yeah, we need help. We're not able to do it ourselves. In fact, this is probably a holdover from Christianity, which has been teaching people for centuries, you need Jesus, you can't do it on your own, you've got an original sin, you're broken. And even though many people are atheists, they still were raised in that culture of somehow you're broken.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. I think that's very— I live in Spain, but I'm Swedish by nationality. And I think even though Sweden is very atheistic and very secular, I think it's just another form of Lutheranism in a way, you know, because they changed that to other, you know, punish yourself, work hard.

**Speaker A:** So, while the atheists need a big daddy called a God, the atheists need a big daddy called government.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, absolutely. And now they're gone.

**Speaker A:** And the real teaching of the Buddha is to come out of needing anything and fix the problems that we have ourselves, and the fixing of the problem is to just ignore the problem. That in fact we don't have any problems, that all the problems that humanity has were dreamt up, invented. Like for instance, the king thinks that he needs a lot of groceries, and so he hires an army to go out and steal the groceries from all the farmers. This is called feudalism. And we have been living under a feudalistic system to where even the aristocrats now are feeling victims, because if they can't steal what they need, they suffer. They can't do without the stealing. And the poor people have to put up with the stealing, and they want some sort of government that doesn't steal from them. And the best thing to do is just to walk away from any big governments, just to walk away. And so these three points of look at what the mind is doing and make a change, like being dependent upon a government, being dependent upon a religion, being dependent upon the psychotherapist, being dependent upon a doctor. Whatever our dependencies are, we really don't need that in order to feel good. What we need to do is to change the way we feel, to stop feeling the way that we were in the habit of feeling and start to feel the way that we want to feel. So I'll ask you that question: if you could feel right now the way that you wanted to feel right now, how would you feel right now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly, like a winner.

**Speaker A:** Like a winner.

**Speaker B:** Can-do spirit.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So this is the practice that we do, is to see the unwholesome thoughts are actually thoughts of 'I need help,' thoughts of losers, thoughts of problems that need to be solved, thoughts of places to go and things to do. And items to purchase and spiritual goals to make instead of just being satisfied with the way things are right now. So we have to practice because we have gotten into such a bad habit. We have been talking ourselves into feeling bad because we want things, and now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good by seeing that we've got everything that we need in order to feel good right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's such a— that's just— but you know, there's— I don't see a lot of Sanghas or Dharma centers or whatever who are communicating this so effectively and so clear, you know. It's even— well, that's because they don't.

**Speaker A:** Know what they're talking about.

**Speaker B:** Well, they must.

**Speaker A:** Have had some lineage. Well, they learned what they learned from a Dhamma teacher who didn't know what he was talking about. In fact, that's what happens in universities, is that people get degrees and start teaching and they don't know what they're talking about. If the students are lucky, the teacher begins to figure out what he's supposed to teach and then starts teaching what he needs to teach rather than teaching what he was told to teach. Dhamma teachers are not so lucky. They continue to teach what they're told to teach, and they keep reading books, and they haven't figured out yet that what we need to do is to change our attitude, right? To change our thoughts, to change the way we feel.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Change our posture, to change the body. In the sense of allowing it to relax.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** So we're full of tension because we're full of wants and desires, and all we have to do is to just drop that and start having thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine, nothing to do, no place to go, everything is all right, right? Then we can feel the way that we want to feel, and in fact, in that case, it would feel relief. Oh, what a relief it is, I don't have to do anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's a hard conversion there, to start making that thought pattern.

**Speaker A:** As soon as someone does it, it's easy enough to do, but as soon as they do it, then they'll revert back to the old way because it's habit-bound. Yeah. And so we have to remember to keep doing this over and over again. You need to practice.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Right, right.

**Speaker A:** No, I mean, any skill in fact requires practice, whether you're going to play the violin or play baseball or martial arts or dancing, whatever it is. It requires practice.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And so this also requires practice because we're already in the habit of feeling bad doing what we're told to do and not liking it, wanting things we don't have and not liking it. So now we have to practice liking whatever it is right here, right now is good enough. And it's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, you know, yeah, just be with whatever is, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, they tell the students that at the Dhamma Center, but they don't put that key ingredient into it, that you actually have to take the effort to come out of your wanting and suffering and take the effort to be okay with what's happening right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Well, the one I've been associated with here hasn't even done that. It's been more kind of trying to form a lifestyle around the Sangha, but not a lifestyle based on the actual Eightfold Noble Path and the the original teachings, more a kind of pseudo, you know, something. But that's some of the teachers that got me into spirituality, was a lot about that. But in a real life context, I haven't seen that being effectively communicated until I came across your dialogues. And.

**Speaker A:** So, yes, they have the form but not the spirit. They've got the letter of the law, but they don't know how to apply it. Yeah, and it's actually quite easy to do, but it's required to be done over and over again. We need to practice it. Then in fact, uh, they've gotten into the habit of talking about practicing for 1 or 2 hours a day for a long sitting, where in fact the human mind doesn't have that kind of attention span until it's trained to have a long attention span. And so the best thing to do is to practice for short periods of time, often throughout the day. 5, 6, 7 times at 10 minutes each will fill that hour. And absolutely best time to practice is right when you wake up in the morning, before you get out of bed. Right. Start practicing, everything is all right, what a nice moment this is.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, I've heard, I've started to apply that, a lot, since I really got into your dialogues, trying to start with wholesome thoughts. And that, it's changing, to be honest. It is remarkable what you can what you can really kind of think yourself into. I was going to say talk yourself, but it's more thinking yourself into it.

**Speaker A:** We actually learn to talk ourselves into feeling good. We talk ourselves into changing our attitude.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** We talk ourselves into relaxing. And the best part is, is that the talking ourselves into it is saying real things. These are not affirmations to where we're thinking, uh, we're talking about the things we want. We're actually talking about the things we've already got. The reality of the situation. Yeah, yeah, practice reality. Right now everything's okay. Right now nothing's dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I actually seen that, that I mean, for the little I've been kind of being influenced from your dialogue is that it can actually— because if you apply to a work situation, for example, I work as a consultant in international business, and where you're so easily getting caught up in a kind of not paranoid, but you know, like this kind of chased-up mindset or strategizing. But actually, if you're If you're just trying to face everything as everything is all right, also I think you can even apply it into work in a more effective way, because instead of building up all these scenarios or stressors, you just kind of— Well, if you think.

**Speaker A:** About it, the business model is a broken model. It's intentionally broken in the sense of, oh, you need to sell more stuff. Oh, you need to upgrade. Oh, you need to lower your taxes. Oh, you need to sell more. Oh, you need to produce more. Everything is built upon lack and loss, up to the point of a gross national product. Yes, only the country of Bhutan has a gross happiness product. I know all the other countries want to produce, produce, and thinking that production brings happiness. And in fact, production doesn't bring happiness. At best, it destroys the planet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you can apply this in the business as a consultant, is to help people to relax. You don't have to work so hard. You can begin to enjoy your life.

**Speaker B:** Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think actually it can benefit also your work in the sense also, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Exactly that you're more— Actually, people can become more productive when they're not driven to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That in fact we play, we begin to do things because we like to do it.

**Speaker B:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Instead of seeing how much work there is to do, we can say, I can do it right now. I can do this right now. I can enjoy doing this right now.

**Speaker B:** No, that's something that I sensed. I mean, it's been very— I've been going deeper in your dialogues. I was at a bit of a crossroad and not very wholesome, coming out of another very wholesome face. And I think it's really been a major change. So I'm really happy that I can have a direct— so now I want to apply it more to my meditation and my Dharma practice, you know, because that's a— I want to go deeper on that path. And.

**Speaker A:** We don't go deep, we just enjoy this moment. Going deep takes a shovel, it takes a backhoe. Going deep requires a whole lot of work. We don't have anything to go deep into. Just what we've got right now is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Why dig a hole when we've got the grass?

**Speaker B:** No, okay, more wholesome than in the moment.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And yet in Western Buddhism, they always talk about going deep, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** And there's nothing down there.

**Speaker B:** You know, there's a Western old Stoic philosopher, Seneca. He used to say, uh, life is not a journey between A and B, it's a unit. You have to live something like that, you know. It's like you have to feel it. And this is actually true. There's no Yeah, so no deeper path, just more of a wholesome moment, I guess, is what I'm looking for.

**Speaker A:** In this present moment, let's have a wholesome moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So where would you suggest I begin? I mean, I'm interested to understand a lot of the concepts that, you know.

**Speaker A:** The We actually don't need a lot of concepts. That in fact, this society that we're in, it promotes conceptualized thinking.

**Speaker B:** I know it's terrible.

**Speaker A:** And what we need to do instead is, instead of having critical thinking, let's have nurturing thinking. Let's nurture everything is all right, okay. Instead of telling the young child inside to shut up and do what you're told to do, we can say goo goo gaga.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, stop being so critical, right? And start being nurturing. This is okay, everything is fine. That's the teaching of the Buddhist, to come out of our dissatisfactions and become satisfied. Critical thinking is all about being dissatisfied, critiquing, trying to fix something that's broken. And guess what? Nothing's really broken. Everything is already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the conceptual mindset, it's so ingrained in you, you know, you've got to do, that's the only way to survival, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** I mean, that's what they taught, and yet people, what kind of survival do people wind up with? Not much, they survive, but they don't have a good time at it. They're not enjoying their life.

**Speaker B:** No, no, you see so much neurosis everywhere, you know.

**Speaker A:** And so start to nurture, start to tell yourself everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, everything is going to be all right, everything's going to be fine. Yes, we practice that way and we become content. We become satisfied. And you've probably heard me say that the Buddhist teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is that we are dissatisfied and we can come back into a state of satisfaction very easily, and that's all the Buddha ever taught.

**Speaker B:** So, Anagami— We can come out of.

**Speaker A:** Our wanting stuff in the far future and start enjoying this moment.

**Speaker B:** So Dukkha and the road is cessation, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, stop being dissatisfied, start being satisfied. Stop finding out what's wrong and just let everything be okay the way it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's funny how that is so Actually, it's very quickly achievable.

**Speaker A:** It is. It's very— but it's also easy to lose it, and so we have to come back and do it again. Yes, because we're in the habit of critical thinking, so we have to practice over and over being in a nurturing thought process to stop being a victim to all the problems and start being the champion of nothing much at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Well, it was funny because I've been trying to apply your— these, what do you call it, ideas, or, you know, just also this kind of things that's been stressing me and bugging me out about certain obligations, you know, like normal stress factors of the tribulations in life. And then Yesterday I was actually, I've been managing to actually put it away and be more in the wholesome moment, but yesterday I was physically confronted on this, you know, like in real life on my way back home. And after it all went okay, but it's kind of, I still started to physically manifest, like almost getting like tourette-like after that, but it was fine, you know. So when there's one thing to actually apply it in, when you're just going on on your own, or you know, when you're not confident, when you're physically confronted, I noticed that it's after that I kind of, I couldn't really stay in the, even when it passed, you know, I was still kind of It was still having, uh, eating me, eating me, so to speak. But I guess the next time would be actually.

**Speaker A:** When— yeah, we can do this anytime that we remember to do it. So the, so the trick is, is to remember often.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right, right, to practice remembering often.

**Speaker A:** Well, Carl, it was nice to meet you, and I'm glad to see that you're practicing correctly. I suggest that you go continue to do that and give me another call in a few days or a week or so, and we'll continue on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that would be a pleasure. And I have some, um, actually Okay, so should I ask, do you have any recommendations for my meditation practice?

**Speaker A:** Yes, read the book Between Your Ears.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And there is one more thing I would like to ask you. I applied and was accepted to a Gwanka retreat, which will be my first one in May. Okay. I've been, since I've also been getting into your stuff, I'm not sure if I really, if I should follow up.

**Speaker A:** Well, I would recommend that you do the retreat, all right, that you add my stuff or the stuff from the Buddha, not mine, but the stuff from the Buddha, add that to it, because they don't, uh, they don't know it, so they don't bother to tell you. And so most of the people who do the retreats struggle. They don't like it. They work at it. And here now you have the secret of just go to the retreat and enjoy it. Keep coming back and remembering, oh, everything is okay. Everything is fine. Go and enjoy the retreat because that retreat setting, if you practice correctly, will greatly improve your skill. Of being able to come back to the present moment happily. But you have to practice correctly. But going to a retreat is a really excellent time or place to go practice correctly.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. No, okay, that's great, that's great, because I thought maybe you would discourage me, or it would be another method that.

**Speaker A:** Could be, or No, I'm not against retreats at all. What I'm against is people not practicing correctly and wasting their time and being frustrated at the retreat.

**Speaker B:** Clear. Okay, got it. Good. All right, so I'll stick to that. And then there was another question I wanted to ask you. I've been pondering part of one of the suttas Um, the, the one with the snake, because I heard you, you've been referring to it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yeah, the Simile of the Snake is Sutta number 22. It's actually quite an excellent sutta. It's got a lot of stuff in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I love it. And is it the 24? It's the 24, right? It's the 24. 22.

**Speaker A:** 22.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Uh, well, I've been— but yes, that one. What is I've been pondering over the raft.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I've been pondering over the raft analogy. The raft?

**Speaker A:** The raft, yes.

**Speaker B:** It's in the same sutta.

**Speaker A:** Yes. What that means is to don't cling to the practice.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Don't cling to the practice. Don't say, oh, I practiced meditation for 25 years. That's like clinging to the practice. What we want to cling to is the joy that we can manufacture right here in this very moment. We don't have to enshrine the raft, we don't have to carry it around with us to show it off.

**Speaker B:** Okay, got it.

**Speaker A:** We just enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, good, because that's such a famous analogy, it's a famous Dhamma story, and I didn't know it was in that sutta. Because I was reading it for the purpose of the other stuff, and then it came up, and I actually haven't really got why, you know, the actual— what is the real meaning? And I'm still— but now it makes sense, because it's still— does it suggest me to kind of, when I got smooth sailing with the practice, should I just kind of go back to my— should I start trying out my old habits?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, very good. Okay, so let's finish the call now, and I'll see you again soon.

**Speaker B:** Sure. Thank you so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay, you too. All right, bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the core teachings and themes from Dhammarato's Dhamma talk:

### **Core Critique: The Missing "Key Ingredient" in Western Buddhism**
Dhammarato argues that Western Buddhism often lacks the essential, practical element of the **Noble Eightfold Path**: **Right Effort**. The problem is an over-reliance on books, discussion, and conceptual understanding without the decisive moment-to-moment effort to **change one's inner state**.

### **The Central Practice: Moment-to-Moment Change**
The goal is not an abstract "lifestyle change," but an immediate change in **this present moment**. By repeatedly changing the present moment, a lifestyle change naturally follows.
*   **The Method:** Use thought to change attitude, which changes feeling.
*   **The Sequence:** **1. Remember** (to be present). **2. Look** (at thoughts, actions, body, feelings, mind state). **3. Change** (from unwholesome to wholesome states).

### **Key Insights & Instructions:**

1.  **Shift from Victim to Agency:** Western mindsets, influenced by religious/cultural heritage, often default to a "victim" mentality—believing we are broken and need external salvation (via God, government, therapy, etc.). The Buddha's teaching is about **self-reliance**: you have everything you need to feel good *right now*.

2.  **Change the Internal Dialogue:** Suffering is fueled by habitual thoughts of lack, desire, and "I need." The practice is to **consciously "talk yourself" into feeling good** by acknowledging the present reality: "Everything is okay right now. I am safe. There is nothing to do." This is not naive affirmation, but a truthful observation of the current moment's adequacy.

3.  **Practice Correctly: Short & Often:** Formal meditation is not about enduring long, arduous sessions. Effective practice involves **short periods (e.g., 5-10 minutes) repeated frequently throughout the day**, especially upon waking. This trains the mind in the new habit of contentment.

4.  **From Critical to Nurturing Mind:** Modern society promotes "critical thinking," which focuses on problems and dissatisfaction. The Dhamma practice cultivates **"nurturing thinking"**—soothing the mind with contentment and acceptance, moving from critique of what's wrong to appreciation of what *is*.

5.  **The Essence of Dukkha and Its Cessation:** The Buddha's core teaching is simplified: **Dukkha = dissatisfaction. Nirodha = satisfaction.** The path is the moment-to-moment cessation of dissatisfaction by choosing to be satisfied with the present.

6.  **Application in Life:** This practice is not for retreat only. It can be applied in work and social settings, replacing a stressful, "chased-up" mindset with one of relaxed adequacy, which often leads to greater effectiveness and enjoyment.

7.  **On Retreats and Tools:** Retreats are valuable **if you practice correctly**—using them as an opportunity to deepen the skill of finding joy in the present moment. The famous **raft simile** teaches **non-clinging**—don't cling to the practice itself or your identity as a practitioner; cling only to the well-being generated. The tool (raft/Dhamma) is for crossing over, not for carrying on your back.

### **Conclusion**
Dhammarato's teaching is a pragmatic, anti-dogmatic call to action. It strips away complex metaphysics and focuses on the **immediate, repeatable act of using one's own mind to abandon dissatisfaction and cultivate contentment in the here and now.** The barrier is not complexity, but the ingrained habit of wanting and the lack of persistent, right effort to change that habit in the immediate moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Big Daddy" Dependency Metaphor:**
    *   **Speaker A** says: "While the atheists need a big daddy called a God, the atheists need a big daddy called government." This metaphor critiques the transfer of a dependent, "savior" mentality from religion to secular institutions.

2.  **The "Digging Deep" vs. "Grass" Metaphor:**
    *   **Speaker A** contrasts the common spiritual goal of "going deep" with his approach: "Going deep takes a shovel, it takes a backhoe... Why dig a hole when we've got the grass?" The "grass" is a metaphor for the present moment's sufficiency, while "digging a hole" represents unnecessary, effortful striving.

3.  **The "Raft" Metaphor (from the Sutta):**
    *   Referenced from the **Simile of the Snake Sutta (MN 22)**, the raft is a classic Buddhist metaphor for the teachings and practice. **Speaker A** explains it means "don't cling to the practice." The raft (the method) is for crossing the river (suffering), not to be carried on land (clung to as an identity or dogma).

4.  **The "Letter of the Law" vs. "Spirit" Metaphor:**
    *   **Speaker A** criticizes some Dharma centers: "They have the form but not the spirit. They've got the letter of the law, but they don't know how to apply it." This contrasts rigid adherence to rules ("letter") with understanding the essential principle ("spirit").

5.  **The "Broken Model" Metaphor:**
    *   Applied to business and society: "the business model is a broken model... Everything is built upon lack and loss." This metaphor describes systems designed to perpetuate dissatisfaction and desire.

6.  **The "Champion" vs. "Victim" Metaphor:**
    *   A central theme: shifting from being "the victim to all the problems" to being "the champion of nothing much at all." This frames the internal change from passivity and neediness to self-sufficient contentment.

7.  **The "Young Child Inside" Metaphor:**
    *   Used to describe self-talk: "Instead of telling the young child inside to shut up and do what you're told to do, we can say goo goo gaga." This advocates for nurturing, reassuring internal dialogue over a harsh, critical one.

### **Stories / Analogies**

1.  **The Story of the King and the Farmers (Feudalism):**
    *   **Speaker A** uses this as a historical analogy for invented problems and dependency: "the king thinks that he needs a lot of groceries, and so he hires an army to go out and steal... This is called feudalism." He extends it to modern times, arguing we still live in a system where both the "aristocrats" (those in power) and the "poor people" feel like victims of this dynamic.

2.  **The Skill Practice Analogy:**
    *   To justify the need for repetition, **Speaker A** says: "any skill in fact requires practice, whether you're going to play the violin or play baseball or martial arts or dancing, whatever it is." He compares cultivating a new mindset to building muscle memory in a physical skill.

3.  **The "Gross National Product" vs. "Gross Happiness Product" Contrast:**
    *   While not a full story, this is a pointed analogy contrasting societal values. **Speaker A** notes that "only the country of Bhutan has a gross happiness product," while others chase production, which "at best... destroys the planet." This frames the pursuit of contentment versus the pursuit of endless growth.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors Underlying the Talk**
*   **Buddhist Path as a "Key Ingredient" or "Secret":** Something missing from Western teachings.
*   **Mind as a Habit Pattern:** Something that can be re-trained through practice.
*   **Present Moment as a "Place":** A location you can "come back to" or "be in."
*   **Thoughts as Things You Can "Talk Yourself Into" or "Out Of":** Like a persuasive internal narrator.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of Buddhism as a practical, present-moment-focused discipline of changing internal habits to achieve self-reliant contentment, sharply critiquing systems (religious, governmental, economic) that foster dependency and dissatisfaction.
