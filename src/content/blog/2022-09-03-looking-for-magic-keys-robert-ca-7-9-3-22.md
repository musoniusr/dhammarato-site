### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So Robert, good to see you again. Today we were talking about knowledge and information and spiritual knowledge and putting two together over and over again to make sure that it means four. The Suttas tend to, for the beginner, looks really, really massive, with all of these bookshelves full of Suttas and all of these different books that have hundreds of Suttas in them. And that we also see lists of things, there's 4 of this and 4 of that, and 4 more of them things over there, and 5 of this and 4 of that, and then another 5 of this, and then 6 of that, and 8 of this, and 9 of that, and 12 of this, and 16 of that. Those things, on and on it goes. Which fits in very well with those of us who have been in school, that have been in the thirst for knowledge, that we felt good when we got 9 out of 10, so I'm going to feel better if I get all 10 out of 10, and now I've got to feel like that on every test. That one of the things that was quite a surprise for me that stuck stuck with me, even though when I learned it I had no understanding of the value. And that was that there was a history exam that I took, and the teacher gave me an A-plus-minus. Very unusual score, A-plus-minus. And the note was, "Answer the questions, don't tell me everything you know." I think you froze. No, you got it. Okay. Yeah, yeah, just answer the question. Don't tell me everything you know was his remark.

**Speaker B:** That's wise. That's very wise. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the way that we can approach the Dharma, is just enough. To answer the question, we don't have to explain it all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when we recognize it like that, we begin to understand, hey, really, the Dhamma of the Buddha is actually quite simple. There's not really much to it, but it is subtle enough that it often has to be described in conceptual ideas dozens of ways before the student finally figures out this little simple thing that we're telling him to keep looking at. Yeah, and that's also part of the problem, is that all of these various suttas and all of these various books may all be pointing at exactly the right thing, and it's the same thing, but the more books we need, the more confused we get. When they're all in fact trying to teach the same thing.

**Speaker B:** That's definitely been my experience, definitely.

**Speaker A:** And so when we begin to see that really there's nothing to it, then that means that we can enjoy the reading because we keep seeing it over and over again, that yeah, there it is again, been there, done that, yeah, I see it too, yes, that's how it's done. And this is the way that we begin to read things, as if we already know what's there. Because in a way, you already do, because you've already seen everything that you need. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So talking about it in the sense of enough— how much do you need in order to have a happy life? Just enough. Just a little dab will do you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's so true.

**Speaker A:** How much air do I need? Just this next breath. That's all I need right now. Later we'll figure it out, but right now all I need is just this bread, just this one thing. And so the Dharma always comes down to just one thing, but we have to break that thing down in the sense of the practice, because it always has to start with— it doesn't matter if there's just one thing, we have to remember that one thing. And so now we've got two things. One is to remember the right thing, and then two, what the right thing is. And the right thing is to look, to remember to look at what's going on right now, not what's written in a book. That's not what we mean, but to look what's written in the mind, to look at what we're doing. Yeah, that's what's needed. And when we do that That brings in a third observation, and that is that, hey, wait a minute, I've got a choice about what I'm doing right now. And I could take that out and put something more wholesome in. And now we're getting around to the most basic part of the practice, which is to remember to look and to change. Remember to look and to change. Remember to look and to change. Remember to look and to gladden the mind. To change. And that's basically all there is to it. And as Westerners say, wait a minute, I've got a PhD in all kinds of crap and I want all kinds of crap before I'll be satisfied with looking at— yeah, remember to look at the change. That's just not enough. I want more, I want more, I want more. Well, now we say, okay, here's how we handle that. I want more, I want more. Remember to look at the fact that I want more and I want more, I want more, and then I can change that into I've got enough already. Let me close that book and take a deep breath and relax, because that's really what we're trying to learn how to do, is just to stop. In this case, even stop reading the books.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. You know, it's funny you said that. I had I had like an awakening experience last week where I was like, I gladdened my mind to such a degree where I felt like the only way to get more glad was just to stop even doing anything, which kind of already is like that. But it was like I kind of had to give up my self-control and my feeling of doership. And this was not like the usual kind of mundane way. This was quite like a, I guess, super mundane kind of like metaphysical way of like, like not being controller, not having self. And then after that experience, I came back and I kept trying to do that for like the next 2 days, where I kept trying to like have no control. And I was like, well, if that insight was true then when I was super happy that all I needed to do was not do anything, then it must be true now. And I was just like swimming in all these hindrances, and I was like, oh well, I just need to be like indifferent to them, I just need to not care. And I was doing so kind of like what you talked about with the Mahasi Method, because I was just like not removing them. So I was like, well, there's no control, there's no doer. And what had gone from like a really like effective technique at the time was now just like, like, just like philosophical, like pontificating and just like thinking about stuff. But it was ineffective because what I needed in that moment, because was just like to just was to accept that I do have a choice and I do have like control and I can just choose what I do. And so I was like, oh, so now I have a choice. Sometimes you don't have a choice, and the choice is to not have a choice. And then sometimes it is to like have a choice and like choose to be happy. And it was like so confusing, but then eventually it kind of, it kind of gelled in my mind a bit where I kind of got what was going on. I was like, okay, so that was then, this is now. I'm trying to use what worked then, now that's not how it is. This is the present moment, let's, let's do what works now. And that was just Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Like, funny thing about This funny thing about this issue of speaking in concepts, because when we're building these concepts, the words actually kind of change meaning. And one of the ways that we can look at that is that word control, that when we are uptight and trying to control things, basically what that means is we're trying to control the situation or control other people. And the reason that we're doing that is because we're not actually in control of our own mind. And so by becoming in control of your own mind, that means that you stop hating what's going on out there. And so we stop trying to control the world because now we're controlling the mind instead. We're controlling the breathing, controlling the mind. And by controlling the breathing and controlling the mind into a wholesome state, then that controls also the feelings. And so now we feel good, we've got the body energized, and we got the mind fit for work. And that's then when the mind is fit for work. That's because we've already finished the real work, and the real work is to get the mind into that state. If we're not in that state, now we have other work to do. And what is that? To control the situation. But once we learn to control our mind, there's nothing left to do.

**Speaker B:** That's that. I know exactly what you mean about the Sila, the morality coming, coming like as like a next step. Because it's like when you're like completely happy and satisfied, like you never want to do mean things. Like you never are mean when you're really in a good mood. And like, it's, it's so true. It's like, I don't need to like worry about like, is what I'm like doing with my life like Is it like a really compassionate life? It's like, no, just like become happy. And that's, that's just what you want to do. Like, it's like, it's like you got to, you got to like start where you're at, you know? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, what we can start at then is to remember to look. And if we look and find that meanness, now we have a choice over it. If we don't see that we're being mean in our thoughts about other people, then we're likely to open our mouth and be mean actually out loud to them. But when we are, uh, awake to the fact that we feel mean towards someone because he did this or he did that or he said this or he said that, and now I have mean thoughts about him, I could then recognize that, hey, who's hurting here? Is it him because I have mean thoughts, or are these mean thoughts themselves painful? Yeah, the one who suffers is the one who's being mean.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's it, man. That's it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we need to wake up to our own meanness or to wake up to our own stubbornness or to wake up on our demand that I've got to get my word in or I've got to say my piece or I've got to tell that teacher how bad I feel when the teacher is not about to let you say that. And so this is what we need to wake up to, is to wake up to this meanness, this demand that we've got to get our way. But in fact, we talked last time about anger, because anger is nothing but the expression of that. We feel powerful when we're angry. We get Anagami, stubborn.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. And you feel like whole inside. Like, I always found like when I have like two sides of me fighting, that's like this division is really uncomfortable. But when I'm angry, it's like I'm all of me is angry. Like, I feel whole and complete. And so it's kind of like satisfying in a way.

**Speaker A:** Like, I feel like, yes, there is satisfaction in anger because the reality is that anger itself is a protective mechanism that is shielding us from danger. That the underlyingness under fear— excuse me, under anger— is fear. That when we get angry, it's because we're afraid that we're not going to get what we want, or that we've lost something, or that something terrible either has happened or is about to happen. And that's the fear, fear of loss. And the anger then is to protect us from that sense of fear of loss. It's a protective mechanism. And in olden days, that fear would have been real because that fear would have been coming from an actual predator. And so we keep that mentality built into our genes as part of the instinctual process that we see things that we don't know and understand, we see them as a predator. Credit to. And so we go around protecting ourselves from things that are in reality not dangerous at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the boss is angry, so what? That's not dangerous. But for most people, when the boss is angry, they feel desperate, they feel in grave danger.

**Speaker B:** It's kind of been like trippy for me because like a lot of what I felt like in danger of was like in danger of having like a bad life. So it was kind of like counterintuitive because like I felt like I needed to like attain like enlightenment and stuff to like, like I need to reach like the goal, right? So that I can have like this great life. But like, even that's like, even that wanting was like, it was more like kind of like desire and stuff. And it was leading to all these other things, like all the negative emotions, you know. I really wanted this, so sometimes I'd be like angry that I don't have it, or I'd be like upset, or— and then it would like project into all these other things, like this need to know and to understand. Like, I need to read all these books, I need to talk to like every teacher who exists so I can get all their wisdom.

**Speaker A:** And it's like Funny how though, when we are angry and upset, we're not in that moment having a good life. The very life that you wanted, you can't give yourself right then.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Unless you can wake up to that. And that's like wake up to see that the very good life that you want, you're depriving yourself of that right now. Wow, that's almost mind-blowing. The very life that we want, the very enlightenment that we want, we are not experiencing that right now because we want something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because we want the life. It's like, it's just like, it's just tricky, man. It just like, it like, you could like, I can't even like wrap my head around it. Like, it's like I want to be happy and then wanting to be happy is stopping being happy. That's like a really simplistic explanation, but it's like, it's so true and it's just like, it's crazy. And, and, and the— this is— this was, this was really interesting, was like, um, I had all these, like, I've had like all these, like, experiences of, like, non-duality where, like, I'll be there and then I'll lose it, and I'll be there and I'll lose it. And, like, I kind of, like— and then every time I'd have one of those, always it would be followed by, like, this process of this really painful process of, like, trying to figure out how I did it and construct a method to get back. So I have a really big one lately was the doubt thing that I was talking to you about with like, why is doubt so overpowered? I was like, oh, all the other hindrances must come from doubt. Doubt is the thing. Therefore, if I just have faith that I'm okay and I believe in myself, then that's it. And then, and then after a while, I had another one which was like, oh, the reason I don't have faith is because I don't love myself enough and it's self-hate. And so if I just have lots of Metta for like my rejected parts of myself, then I'll like have it. And so it's like always changing, like the like the thing that I think is going to be the, like, the magic key is like, it's never the magic key. Like, it's always like changing. Like, and for that time, that doubt was what I had to do. And then for the next time, it was like my self-hatred. And then, you know, for the next time, it was like— well, they run in circle around each other.

**Speaker A:** They're all just aspects of the same thing. That we're in doubt, we're in a hurry to get the answer. There is restlessness. Doubt and restlessness are the same thing. Doubt and ignorance are the same thing. They're confusion. We don't know, and we feel uncomfortable because we feel unsafe because we don't know. Okay. And then we don't like feeling dangerous. And so the hindrances are just all the same thing. And so what you're doing is you're chasing around saying which one caused which. Well, they're all causing each other. It's an interrelated ball.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's like, it's just like a big, like, bowl of, like, yarn, like, kind of like, and like sometimes you have to, like, pull on one yarn to, like, untangle the whole bowl. Sometimes you have to pull another. It's like whatever ends kind of, like, sticking out.

**Speaker A:** I feel like, I don't know, you are actually now describing Gordian's Knot. Do you know the story of Gordian's Knot?

**Speaker B:** I am not familiar.

**Speaker A:** Okay, in the very, very ancient times, there was an impact because no one could untie the Gordian Knot. That I don't even know what they called it then. But the idea was that it was a piece of rope that was so tightly wound together and all tied up that no one could figure out how to untie this rope. And then it became a contest, and then it became a religion. And so now here's this temple with this rope hanging from it that's all tied up, and you've got all of these scribes and Pharisees and meditators and everybody sitting in the room trying to figure out how to untie this knot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And Gordian himself walks in, he sees what's going on, he asks, and he gets the understanding, and he then takes the rope down and takes his sword out and he cuts it in half. That's what happened. Just cut it, just cut it out, just stop. That's the Gordian's Knot. Stop trying to untie all of this mess of the Dharma. It just cut right through it. It's simple. It's that simple. We don't have to figure out how to untie it. Have you? In fact, the one that I remember was fishing line, trying to untangle a great big knot of fishing line. Another one that people struggle with, and that is untying last year's Christmas lights that are all in a great big mess.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've struggled with that myself. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the right way to do Christmas lights is to keep cutting them where there's sockets. Don't leave two big tangles of mess and leave them at one big tangle of mess. At least get the ends so that you could find out how to pull the ends out. But the ultimate answer is go buy some new Christmas lights and throw the old ones out. We don't need to untangle that mess.

**Speaker B:** I thought that was what you were going to say, like about the Gordian Knot. I thought it was like the solution of the Gordian Knot is just like just like throw it away, just like exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is what we can do with our confusion in the mind. Instead of trying to figure it all out so that we'll be happy, we could just throw that knot out and be happy. We don't have to have the answers to our questions to be happy.

**Speaker B:** Um, oh yeah, like, it's like you have to have like comfort with not knowing. That's, that's one way I've heard it described. And it's like, and this is like so crazy because it's like, it's kind of like a solution to doubt is to just like not care that you're doubting, right? You have comfort with not knowing. You're like, I don't know, but that's okay. And then you're like, wait, like you said, like you're above it all. You're just like, you're just chilling. It's like, yeah, sure, I don't know what it is, but I don't care. Like, I'm above it because I'm okay with that. I don't know. And then I kind of like, I heard that, and while you were talking, I kind of like extrapolated that out. So it could be like, well, if you're feeling angry, it's like, don't be bothered by the fact that you're angry. Because for me, a lot of the time when I feel angry, I have like this rushing energy, like, this is a hindrance, I have to get rid of this, I have to get rid of this. And it's like, but if I just be like patient with myself and be like, okay, with I'm angry, like, that can kind of like make it a lot easier to just start practicing again, you know. And so like, I'm kind of curious if you think like that's kind of a way it could work with like every hindrance, just like you just don't be bothered by it being there. You're like, that's okay, you know, it's okay that I don't know, it's okay that I'm upset about this, you know. It's kind of like, I don't know, I'm kind of curious of your thoughts.

**Speaker A:** If you just had the thought, it's okay that I'm angry, that itself, that okay with anger, is not an angry thought. I think that you just, you just made a change there. But if you say, oh damn it, I'm angry, now you're still angry. You can see the anger, but you're angry. Now you could say, I'm angry and that's okay, I can see it now. By saying that I could see it now, you're already in the process of making a change. That makes it so easy. It's just to see it and recognize that that's what it is. The recognition that it is there is part of the change process itself. That's when the Sati is strong. The Sati helps that right effort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I feel like a lot of like with meditation, it's like, it's like I'm a lot of the times I'm, I've, it's, well, this is actually really obvious, but I'm gonna say it like, it's like I'm like reacting to the Sati. So it's like I'm reacting to like what I've seen. And like, I kind of think of the Sati as like having like an insight. So it's like you've seen that you're angry. That's like an insight into the way things are like. And you've like identified it as anger, maybe that's it, like you're noting it or something. But like, you don't really need to do that, you can see that you're angry, right? And then it's like you can react to that badly and be like, oh no, I'm angry, I need to figure a way out. Or you can be like, oh, good seeing, good seeing me. And then you're like— and then the Sati comes more often, you see, the Sati like repeats more often because you're rewarding yourself for it instead of discouraging yourself. And like, and like when you like— and I feel like it's kind of this, it kind of works like the opposite with like, with like good things. So if it's like I see that this is good, this is like a good thing, if I say, oh yeah, like good job me, nice, nice, like that can kind of like make me attached to it. Like I can be like, oh good job me, like it's me, I saw it, like I'm, I'm so, I'm so good. And it's like actually like kind of the opposite where if it's like oh, like, that's cool, that's fine, like, whatever, that's cool. You, you don't really, like, try to appreciate it. Like, it's kind of like the opposite with, like, happy things. And then that makes it, like, maybe last longer. Like, with, like, um, like, Jhana— it's like, if I go into a Jhana for, like, I'll get in for a second, and then I'll be like, yeah, I did it, I'm out. But if I, like, ignore the Jhana and I just keep doing Anapanasati, it— all the, like, happiness, like, wells up on its own. Yeah, because I'm kind of, like, ignoring it. So it's kind of like an opposite. But I just, I just thought that was kind of cool. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. It's almost like, um, in the old days when batteries and automobiles and spark plugs and all of that existed, that we would have to push the car off, and after we got the car rolling, then we had to run to the door, open the door, jump in the driver's seat, put it in gear, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's kind of the sequence that it looks like that you're doing, that when you get the Jhana going, you've got to go jump into seat to try to control it or something like that, where in fact what we need to do is to stay in the back of the car and keep pushing. And don't worry about where the car is going. The fact is that we got it rolling right now. We'll learn to steer it later. So this is what we mean, is to come back to the Anapanasati. Just keep going with— never mind that thought.

**Speaker B:** Never mind, start again. That's like the ultimate mantra. That's so good. Yeah, that's it, man. That's it. It's like never mind, start again.

**Speaker A:** To just keep coming back to that breath, keep coming back to the gladdening of the mind, keep coming back, keep coming back. That's all there is to it. It's a very simple game, a very simple process. And yet somehow or another, because of high tech or whatever, It seems that the Western mindset means that we've got to find something that's hard to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like for me it's like I have to find like the first principle, I have to find like the root of all the suffering and I have to find like the root-like solution, it's like I have to, you know, like whatever, whatever, whatever. But it's like, and that like trying to like, which on the surface it sounds good, it's like you have a problem, you find a solution that works every time, that's like like, duh, but like, actually, like, the solution that works, quote unquote, every time is just like not caring about finding a solution that works every time. And like, that actual trying to understand like the Dhamma and reading all the books and trying to like cross-reference like Hinduism and Buddhism and the traditions, because it was like, like, that's like the hindrance.

**Speaker A:** And that's like, that's like what we're talking about before, like, it's like, scholarship is a hindrance. And there are tons and tons and tons of Buddhist scholars, many of whom are monks. Quite a few of them, in fact, the ones who are in the most danger of never getting any value out of the teachings of the Buddha, do their Buddhism by getting a PhD in Buddhist studies, which means those guys have no chance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's got no opportunity. Why? Because their teachers are just other college professors. In fact, most of the Buddhist teaching, when someone goes to a famous university like Harvard to get a PhD in Buddhism, the professors that are there to teach have a PhD in probably something else. That was what was going on with computer science when the PhD programs were done in computer science. All of the professors had PhDs in something else, because there were no PhDs in computer science. So I had PhDs in nuclear physics, which they knew quite a lot about computers, but they had PhDs in nuclear physics, or mathematics or something like that. So that's how it is with Buddhist studies, is that the people who were teaching, they don't know what the teachings of the Buddha are about. They just got PhDs in something or another.

**Speaker B:** And that— yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It sucks as well because those are the ones translating all the suttas, right?

**Speaker A:** So those are the scholars, the ones who learn Pali without learning what the Pali is actually trying to say. Better thing to do is to figure out what the Pali is saying and then translate. Except by the time you've actually figured out what the Pali is saying, who bothers to translate? That's why that's the thing.

**Speaker B:** That's the thing.

**Speaker A:** We're almost doomed to have bad translations because the only people doing translations are the ones who don't understand it. That's why they're translating. Once you understand it, why bother to do more translations? We know, we understand.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. It's like, it's like, it's like when you— it's like when you— it's like that quote from Alan Watts, like, when you get the message, hang up the phone. It's like, it's like, you know what to do. Just like do Anapanasati, just relax, you know. If you need a Mantra, just say like, this is fine. That's one I use a lot. I just, you know, it's like, just, just don't worry about it. Like, ignore the problem and it goes away. And it's like, and then like, I'll— I don't even know, man. I confuse myself just trying to think about it and describe it.

**Speaker A:** It's like, yeah, we could just enjoy it. We don't have to even describe it.

**Speaker B:** That's, that's it, man. We don't even need to like note it. We can just chill. Like, yeah, describe it, like note it, like whatever.

**Speaker A:** Just go right to the right effort of throwing that stuff out and just chill. Everything's okay. Wow, what a simple teaching, and yet it's so difficult for us to figure out that how simple the teaching really is.

**Speaker B:** Well said, well said. That's a, that's a really good point there.

**Speaker A:** It's like, yeah, never mind, start again. Never mind all of that crap. We don't have to describe it, don't have to understand it, we don't have to hate it, we don't have to love it. Just throw it out. That's what garbage is. We do not have to be garbage collectors or garbage Collectors is a great word, wasn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, garbage scientists.

**Speaker A:** We're garbage collectors.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, I was— I had like— I mean, look at your back wall. Your back wall is just absolutely covered with beautiful garbage. It's just— you're a garbage collector.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, pretty much, pretty much.

**Speaker A:** So recognize that we do that with the mind too, that you collected that stuff for your wall because you were collecting that stuff for your mind.

**Speaker B:** I had like a kind of non-dual thought just now, which is like the problem is like you're trying to simplify something that's so simple you can't like simplify it. It's like you're trying to simplify something for one thing.

**Speaker A:** Anicca, right? Anagami, Arhat.

**Speaker B:** Right, it's not— it's already like kind of just like nothing. Like you said, there's like nothing much to it. It's like just by simplifying it, you're already making it into something. Like everyone knows how to do it, like innately. Like we know the difference between happiness and sadness. Like every human being knows that. You'd have to be like— you'd have to have like a disorder where you can't feel pain not to, you know.

**Speaker A:** Like it would be a language confusion, but beyond language confusion, even the people in the mental world they still know the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Yeah, I know, because I worked in those wards.

**Speaker B:** Do you think— this is kind of interesting— but do you think like the method is arbitrary in a way? So like if you use Anapanasati, or if you use like Kriya Yoga, which is Kriya Pranayama, it's just like it's deep breaths but you like visualize chakras and stuff. It's slightly different. It's like a Hindu kind of method, or like self-inquiry.

**Speaker A:** So that is why there are so many different spiritual practices all over the world, from the whirling dervishes to the sitting meditators to the rishis to the priests, to all kinds of folks have all kinds of practices and methods. And sometimes they work, but mostly they don't. And the reason for that is because the methods that were designed were designed by people who knew that what they were really trying to do with this technique was to get the guy out of his old unwholesome thoughts about it and to get him into wholesome thoughts. This is what prayer is all about. Prayer and supplication. Oh, wow, things are so great. We got such a good God here. God's taking care of everything. Why don't people then realize that and just chill? No, they say, oh, God's our good. God is a great God, and we got to go to battle and beat all them other people into making them believe what we believe. Because actually, I don't believe my good God is all that good anyway. We got to make him better by getting him a bigger crowd.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good point, man. That's good. Oh man, good seeing Dhammarato. Nice. Wow.

**Speaker A:** So wholesome thoughts can come from anywhere, but the human mind is always wanting more and more and more. So the technique is not really important. What's important then is back to the Eightfold Noble Path. Those specific things is to remember to look at what you're doing. It doesn't matter how many spiritual practices there are in the world. The problem with every one of them is that at the wrong time, or at just the time when somebody needs that spiritual practice, he's forgotten to do it and is getting angry and frustrated and uptight instead of following his spiritual practice of, oh, my God's a good God and everything is going to be okay and there's no worries. If he'd think about it like that, if he'd remember to think about it like that, then he would be chilled.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it doesn't matter, like spiritual practice, if the question is, can you remember to do that spiritual practice?

**Speaker B:** And like, another thing I've like kind of seen is like, not even with just like people like debating like which practice is like the most effective one, because that's like everyone's debate when they start. So effective, it's like, it's like which like, which like enlightenment, or like which altered state of consciousness basically is like the, the best one, you know? Like people will be like, if it's not like this Jhana, it's not like good. But like if you're like happy and satisfied, like you're kind of Gucci, like it doesn't really matter. Like like if it's the first jhana or if it's the eighth jhana or what, like your philosophical insight.

**Speaker A:** There's an Anagami.

**Speaker B:** What is that again?

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** A couple of them. It's a— I mean, I'm sure you're familiar.

**Speaker A:** I got one sutta where you can number them up to 9, but in the sutta they stop at 4, but then they give 5 aspects of the fourth jhana. That's where all those other numbers come from is what do you do when your mind is for work.

**Speaker B:** Okay, here's an interesting question. Is— would you say like the, the three ones after the first, the first one are also aspects of the first one?

**Speaker A:** It depends. Once you got the mind fit for work, the other jhanas are merely what you're working on. That's all there is to it. Yeah, I feel like— point is, is that when we are developing the first jhana And while we're in the first Jhana, we pay attention to applying the mind to the wholesome and sustaining the wholesome. Once we get that rolling so that all the mind's thoughts are wholesome, one wholesome thought after another, after another, after another, we can begin to put some gaps in those discursive wholesome thoughts into another kind of thought. And that thought is feeling, feeling good. When you feel really, really good, in that instant you're in the second Jhana. And that happens on birthdays, it happens on paycheck days, it happens all the time when people can see that paycheck, feel good, sigh, relax.

**Speaker B:** That actually clarifies a lot for me. It's like the first Jhana is like you're enjoying pleasure with the mind, and then the second one's like like you're just enjoying it with the heart. Kind of like, I think of it like maybe, I don't know, right?

**Speaker A:** But it is also overwhelmingly exhilarating. How good can you feel this second jhana? So good you don't have to talk yourself into feeling good anymore. You just feel good. And that's how you're spending this one moment and the next one moment and the next one moment of, wow, how nice this stuff is.

**Speaker B:** Do you remember that story I said, um, at the beginning about how like I had like, like my like awakening experience and then I didn't have to do anything to like make the like happiness and the non-dualness like continue? I feel like that might have been actually kind of like first Jhana, like to second Jhana, because like I didn't have to do anything, but then I kept applying the technique that worked in the, in like the transition, right? To keep it going when I wasn't even in Jhana. Like, I was just— so I was just feeling like all the garbage.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, you see, this whole issue of the jhanas are overrated. Buddhism would be Buddhism and would work beautifully without any name of jhana. We don't need it. The Buddha in fact had the jhanas before He even was doing the austerity. So he did jhanas early in his practice, first 2 or 3 years after he was 29. So jhanas are really, really highly overrated. Now, we can also say that when the mind is fit for work, jhanas are also natural occurrences. Depending upon what you're paying attention to, what you're looking at. If you're looking at how good you feel, that's definition of second jhana. When you're looking at how nice things are, even though you feel really, really great, you're still just— then that's the third jhana. And then when you melt into just a puddle of nothing, then that's the fourth jhana. But now you can pay really close attention to what's in that puddle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good point. That's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's all these jhanas are. They're just what are you looking at? Are you looking at the mind? That's first jhana. If you're not looking at the mind, you're just out there being, behaving like a human, then that's not jhana. That's ordinary behavior. First jhana is actually looking, paying attention to, and controlling your thoughts, your mind, and your feelings. But then as we gain skill at controlling the mind, we start paying more attention to controlling the feelings. How good can I feel? I don't have to talk to myself about how good I feel. And in fact, talking to myself about how good I feel is not as good as actually just feeling that good. So it's really hard to talk about how good can you feel. So those are the Jhanas. It depends upon what we're thinking about or what we're paying attention to. So paying attention to how you feel And then you begin to pay attention to how the mind itself works. And that's the fourth jhana, paying attention to how the mind works. In fact, the fourth jhana is when the mind is in a state that we can actually see some of the Piti, Samuppada in operation, especially in reserve to the five aggregates. You can think about it like this, that the first half of the Piti, Samuppada has one function, And the second half has another function. Okay. The second half of Paticcasamuppada, which is Vedana, Tanha, Upadana, Dhamma, Bhavana, Jhana, Sati, Dukkha. That sequence is for the mind in ignorance. That sequence doesn't happen when the mind is fit to work, it stops at feelings. So now you have the range of from ignorance to feelings to work with. And when the mind is fit for work, we start looking at how do these images, how does this thought system affect our feelings? Because the Buddha's already told us that it does. That's why we were changing from unwholesome to wholesome. So now we begin to see how my thoughts affect how I feel. If I can see how my thoughts affect how I feel, guess what? I can control my feelings by controlling my thoughts. Backing up one more step, we begin to see what is perception. How do we think the way that we do is because of our past. If we stop pulling stuff out of the past and stay in this present moment, then our perception is much more cleaner and our observations are our internal representation of reality is very close to reality. So this is how we can actually see that when the mind is in fourth jhana, or in fact when you're looking at that stuff within mind, you are in fourth jhana, even if it's for a short period of time. The question is, if you can develop sustaining the mind in a wholesome place at first jhana, then you can learn then to sustain looking at perception so that you come down to the point that you're just in consciousness, just in sensory awareness. And that's really gaga feeling. That's in fact paying attention to that in the first place, which is what second jhana was all about. So these things are really interrelated, but the real issue is, is can you stay and sustain the mind in a wholesome state? If you could do that, the, the, these jhanas are going to happen on their own, and you don't have to say that one's better than the other. So after all of that, where were we? We were talking about the jhanas and whatnot.

**Speaker B:** I can't remember exactly where we were. Oh yeah, I was going to talk about the 10 factors, but before that, I just— I'm just like kind of curious, like, how did you figure all this like out, man? Like, did Buddha Dassa just tell this all to you, or like— because like I've read like tons of books and they all give like different advices and like talk about different things that just, they don't like hit home the same way like you're teaching. Like, your teaching is very like— for me, it's like really the way you teach the Buddhist method, it's like it makes sense. Like, but like other teachers, like, stuff just doesn't— it doesn't really make sense. So like, is it just how you explain it, or like, is this what you learn in like every monastery?

**Speaker A:** Like, uh, well, the answer to that question is no, but I did have two good teachers. And in fact, more than one. I've learned from a modest lot of people, but I would say that it was Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and his influence on others like Acharnpo. That actually allowed me to be in an environment to where I was basically not allowed to be un-noble.

**Speaker B:** I see, that is interesting, that is very interesting. That's very, very interesting.

**Speaker A:** Everyone around was completely noble, and when I would bring up my dead rabbit or something out of the past, they just laugh at me, you know.

**Speaker B:** Oh my gosh, now I see where you get like your dark humor from.

**Speaker A:** From.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's cool, man, that's cool. I see where you get your dark sense of humor from.

**Speaker A:** I didn't know it was dark.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, it seemed kind of dark, like, to me. Like, I was a bit surprised. Like, with like the— do you remember like the puppy GIF? And you were like, with like the mother's hands around the neck. And I was like, I was like, like, what's he talking about?

**Speaker A:** Like Oh, I see what you're talking about. No, the idea is to give big, clear examples so that the student really understands what we're talking about, because the concept that we use is outlandish and overboard. Mm-hmm. Okay. An example would be teaching Paticcasamuppada and talking about contact. Is like that. We've seen a tree and we crawl up into the tree, and that tree then is our understanding of self. And the way that that tree impacts us is when we fall out of it and we crash land. That's pausa, that's contact. When we fall out, bang. Okay, so that's okay. Okay, so it's a strong way of looking at it. A lot of people think of paśa, or contact, as kind of rubbing by or scraping by or touching like on a crowded street. But no, it's much more like touching something on a crowded high-speed freeway where every bumper nick is a big deal. Yeah, you gotta stop and talk about it and look at the damage. So that's what we've got to do. We can't just brush by with this Dukkha. We got to stop and pay attention to the damage that just happened, swap some names and look at what's going on. So that's why we use examples that are very big and very clear, is to give the students the understanding that Things are very clear if you see them directly. It is very hard because we often get some desire, we get some value out of the hindrance. The hindrances were there because we ignorantly thought that they had some value or gratification.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, like with the anger thing, it's so obvious, right? It feels good, kind of good, like in a weird way. It's like, yeah, like we think it's like a good thing. We think it's good to like be afraid of not knowing because that will help us know. We don't realize like that ignorance is like that. It doesn't matter that we don't know.

**Speaker A:** And so if we can recognize that the damage that we do with these hindrances, then we can throw them out. One of the teachings of the Buddha This is actually in several suttas, longer suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya, but even in the Anicca and the Samyutta Nikaya is the story of another kind of Triple Gem, and that is that we get gratification. We get gratification from what we do. One of the gratifications of doing this same repetitive habit is that I don't have to look at what I'm doing, I don't have to take the effort, I can just do it automatically. That we are often on automatic pilot because we trust that we can get away with being on automatic pilot, and there we run our little birdie into the side of a tree. Yeah, because we think that the automatic pilot, the bird, doesn't have to watch where he's going.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so this is one of the gratifications that we get, is life is easy and I can just cruise and get away with it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** The fact is that we can't get away with it. We keep running into things if we're not looking at where we're going. And what are we most likely running into is the hindrances in our mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so then we begin to say, I— this may not be as gratifying as I thought that it was because I'm actually into Buddhism and into meditation and all that because I've already begun to see enough Dukkha to recognize that there's Dukkha everywhere. Okay, so this is the idea. Then we got to really look at what we're doing.

**Speaker B:** And that's like the energy. That's like the energy part, right? That's like you have to have the energy to like pay attention. You can't just like feel good and then stop paying attention because then like an hour later, like you're back in the hindrances and you're like, oh, now I have to start all again from the beginning again to like cloud my mind.

**Speaker A:** Right. The secret to high-speed motorcycle racing is that you keep paying attention and keep paying attention and you keep looking down the road as far as you can see. Otherwise, you're going to crash.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Crash if you don't watch where you're going when you're running. And here we are running and racing around our high-speed lives crashing left, right, and center because we're not paying attention to where we're going, what we're doing.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And it's easy to stop paying attention. It's easy to take great gratification as, oh well, so far so good, I don't have to watch, I can get away with not watching where I'm going.

**Speaker B:** And then that was me last week, man. Like, I was like, I was like, I had like this like big like awakening opening thing, and I was like like, oh, this must be like, like stream entry, because it was like the biggest one that I've had. But anyway, I don't— it wasn't stream entry, but like I thought it was. And so I was just like being lazy, and I was like, oh, I don't have to, I don't have to do work anymore. And then next thing you know, like 3 days later, I'm— all this Dukkha's back. I'm like, oh no, I lost it. And like getting all butthurt, like, because like I had made like the spiritual ego out of like this attainment when really it's just an experience. Like, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole quality we have keep watching what we're doing, because the danger is if we're not watching what we're doing, we're going to screw up again. That things are too complicated to just let things go on automatic pilot. That's why they don't use— not until Tesla does it— but takeoff and landings require a great deal of attention, that they can't be done with automatic pilots. So every time that we take off and every time we land, we have to do that very consciously. Cruising is okay to let cruising happen on automatic pilot, but as soon as something happens, we got to pay attention, otherwise we're going to crash. Yeah, so this is now the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, going in this point that we get a great deal of gratification by going on automatic pilot and letting things cruise. Because it's easy. The problem with this is that we don't see the dangers in that. Here's an example. Homer Simpson loves donuts. Oh, does he love donuts. Anytime there's donuts in the break room, he goes and eats all the donuts. He goes to the pastry shop and he buys donuts, and then he goes to the doctor and the doctor says, you've got diabetes, you've got high blood pressure, you've got chronic obesity. If you don't stop eating those donuts, they're going to kill you. Now the question is, is Homer Simpson going to listen to the doctor or not? If he listens to the doctor, now he understands the doctor is saying danger in donuts. You might have had a great deal of gratification by eating donuts, but donuts are dangerous for you now. And so he begins to plot his escape. One of the escapes is don't go to the donut shop. Don't go to the break room. Don't go shopping and buy donuts and bring them home. Because if we bring them home now, we don't have the willpower to resist them. OK, so donuts are dangerous. We can stop the donuts. This is the whole practice. And when we recognize these mental hindrances are actually just donuts that we love to eat and making us sick, I mean, little kids are that way all the time. They talk about getting hypertense, right? The teacher, on a good day, will have a birthday party or something, and there's cake all over the place, and every kid goes on a sugar high, and they're just jumping all over the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** And so that's what sugar highs do to us. They're dangerous. And yet we got a great deal of satisfaction out of eating all of that candy or all that cake.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So now that we recognize that the cake has dangers built into it, we can start to either moderate it or eliminate it. And this is the way that we're going to be doing with our mind, is that we either moderate it or eliminate it. Now, what happens is when people say, all right, I'm going to eliminate it, it, and then it comes back, then they get frustrated again. That's a very common thing. Almost all of the good students worry because they thought if they threw that hindrance out, booted him out hard enough, and give him a great big butt job, just kick the hell out of him, you know, he won't come back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like a boomerang.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to kick him even harder next time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, all you have to do is just nudge him out, but he's going to come back. Just nudge him out again. Yeah, we also have the idea that we're going to uproot that hindrance. No, what we can only do is to nudge him out when it comes. An example of that is a weed that's growing out of the crack in the pavement that belongs to the city, a sidewalk or something. You can't go tear up the city sidewalks. That's a lot of work, even if you did, just to get rid of that little weed that's coming. Much better is when the weed does come up, just whack it off at the surface. That's all you have to do. Just whack it off. You keep whacking that leaf off every time it comes up, the root's going to wither and die. The same thing is true with the mind. These hindrances, if you give them any gratification at all, that's feeding them. And if you give them no gratification at all and say, hey, I don't need that, that's Dukkha. Out it goes, then that will eventually wither and die. And you don't have to uproot it. All you have to do is just throw it out right now.

**Speaker B:** And I kind of feel like when you're trying to like uproot it, you're making a really big deal out of it. Like it's like, I gotta end suffering forever. It's like you're turning suffering from this tiny little thing that was bothering you now into this lifelong issue. It's like your lifelong spiritual quest. And you're just like blowing it up out of proportion.

**Speaker A:** And now it seems Look how many books you've read, and look how many books you've read because it was a great big deal. Now that we recognize that there's nothing to it, you don't have to do a lot of reading. The thing that we need to read is, do I see that thing coming up?

**Speaker B:** And if I do, Anapanasati, out it comes, out it goes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that makes the practice very easy because you only have to remove this hindrance.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yes. So is the fetters— can we think of the 10 fetters as just an expanded version of the 5 hindrances? So they just add 5 more? Like, is that how you think about them?

**Speaker A:** Or like— Yeah, there they are. They're listed that way. The hindrance of doubt is in fact the fetter of ignorance. The fetter of wanting something, of lust in this moment, is exactly the same thing as the underlying greed and ill will, which is the fourth and the fifth thread. Yeah, they're the same thing. They're just ways of talking about them.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** This hindrance, you're breaking its root.

**Speaker B:** I think kind of what I do, like, in my mind a lot, it's like I kind of, I reify like the lists. So I'll say the five hindrances, I'll be like, anytime I have a negative thought, I'm like, oh, which hindrance is this? Like, not that it matters because I can, I know how to like get out of it. Like, I don't need to know which hindrance it is, but I'll like, which hindrance is it, or which fetter is it? Like, I'll kind of make a big deal about it.

**Speaker A:** Like, that is very Mahayana. That's very much the Pasi method. And all we really need to know is this is a hindrance from me feeling as good as I would feel if I would stop doing that. Recognizing that the hindrances are like that. Here's one more thing that I'll tell you about, and that is that in Sutra number 39, there are 5 metaphors or 5 similes. For the hindrances. And guess what? These 5 similes do not correspond one-on-one with the hindrances, but they do give an indication to how interrelated the hindrances are. So the first story is the story of being sick in the hospital, and you feel bad, you felt bad, you went to the hospital. But when you get out of the hospital, You want out. You're really happy to get out of the hospital. You feel freedom. No one wants to stay in the hospital even when they're sick. But when you don't feel so sick and in fact, the story is, is that the doctor comes by and he checks you out and says, yeah, it's okay for you to go home. Let's do all the paperwork and we'll come back. And now you're sitting there on your hospital bed, got new clothes on, waiting to leave the hospital. Hospital, and you can't because they haven't done the paperwork yet. They haven't gotten your bill yet, and you can't see— yeah, and you really want to get out of this hospital. Yeah, right. And so when you do get out of the hospital, oh, what a relief, I am out of this hospital. Okay, so that's the first example, that when we are sick, we're sick. When we get well, we feel a whole lot The second analogy is the analogy of being in prison. When we are in prison, we want out. We know when the due date is. We know that we've either got a life sentence, we're never getting out, or we got 5 years, or we got 2 years, or whatever like that. And we're planning on getting out. The number one thing for all prisoners is getting out of prison.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** When you get out of prison, oh, what a relief it is to be out of prison. So these analogies are beginning to point out that the reason that we want to be free from the hindrances is what I believe it is, to have them out of the mind. So the next one is the servant of the king. This guy has to get up in the morning before the king gets up so that he could dress the king and get the king fed. And now he's got to follow the king around all day long taking care of the king. And then at the end of the day, He has to put the king to bed first before he can go to bed. And this is his day in, day out. Well, guess what? We have that kind of life ourselves. What is— who are you, or what are you a servant to? Your desires. They're the king, and you got to go around filling all of those desires. You're the servant of your own desires. And when you allow those desires to go to sleep, now you can rest.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's a really good one. That's a really good point. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I'm kind of like just like a slave to my every impulse. Well, not every impulse, because I'm more of a slave to like the desires, like wanting to be wealthy and stuff, because that's like trying to make money every day. It's like that's like a That's like a socially sanctioned impulse, if you will.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the fourth one is being in debt. You've got a mortgage. Every month you got to pay the mortgage, or you're owing into the loan shark and you keep having to hide from the loan shark because every time the loan shark sees you, he wants money. All right. And then imagine that you are out of debt. Either the loan shark himself died, or maybe you moved to another country. Or that you've paid the debt and now you're debt-free. You don't owe anybody anything. What a relief it is that in fact when people pay off their mortgage, they have a celebration. Wow, what a relief it is to have that debt paid, and now I don't owe anybody anything. That in fact, if you owe anything, if you've got credit cards or any of that kind of stuff, It's a burden and we have to do it. So we are actually indebted to our desires. We have to go pay whatever our desires say that we want.

**Speaker B:** Oh my God, that's a crazy way to think about it because I feel like now that you said it and phrased it like that, I'm thinking of it like less like it's like my desire and it's like a desire that's like I'm like the servant of it, and it's like, what? But that's like, I guess that's part of the counterintuitive, like, strange, loopy trickiness of the whole thing. It's like my desire, but I'm like a slave to it. It's like, it's crazy.

**Speaker A:** All right, now the last one on the list is the item that is referred to is that you are on a long journey. In the sutta, it talks about one who has a camel load load of goods. You're the merchant, and you're traveling through the desert, which is hot, dry, and dangerous. And then finally, you either get to a rest stop or to an oasis, or even back home. And the first thing that happens is that you relax. An example of that is when you moved into— you're out traveling and you move to a hotel room, you get the room, and the first thing you do when you get into that hotel room is that you lay down on the bed. Ah, relax, we're finally home, we finally can relax, our traveling is finished. That in fact, that happens with cowboys who ride into town after they've been out on the hot dusty trail. The first thing they do when they get off the horse is not take care of the horse, the first thing they do is they go into the saloon. And sit down. All right, take a load off. Okay, I have finally arrived. So this is the quality of the feeling of being free from the hindrances, is that we're home, we've relaxed, we don't have the burden, we can set down our burdens. In fact, the setting down of the burden is the same thing as getting out of the prison, getting out of the hospital, or getting out of debt. Freedom has the taste everywhere, just like every sea, no matter which river flows into the ocean, all the ocean tastes the same, it's all salty. Freedom from the hindrances is that way, too. It doesn't matter which hindrance you're fed into, the taste of the freedom from that hindrance is always the same. Freedom! I'm free of it! Yeah, okay, so that's what we need to start paying attention to, is, aha, I see you, and now I'm free from you. Uh-huh, I don't have to think about that. That's the relief that we feel when we recognize that we have just finished that hindrance, that we have arrived home, that we've gotten out of the hospital. That we've just been released from jail, that we've just gotten out of debt. Having that kind of feeling is what we expect to have for the first Jhana, is that feeling of relief. All of these things have the quality of the feeling of relief. Coming home after a long journey with all of our goods, what a relief. Coming out of the hospital, what a relief. Coming out of prison. So all of those books you're reading, set them down. What a relief. Okay, so anyway, let's go ahead and finish the call. I think that we've gotten somewhere with this. When you begin to understand that these hindrances, getting rid of them, the taste is relief. The taste is feeling of freedom. And that's what we're looking for. Throwing the hindrances out actually creates that sense of relief, just like paying a debt off. Yes, being free from debt or coming home after a long journey, and we feel relief.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So go with that, go with getting the hindrances out of the mind, and then take the relief.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right. I don't know if you can hear me, but fantastic. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I can hear, I can hear enough. Okay, Robert, we'll see you later. And ciao.

**Speaker B:** All right, fantastic. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** See you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on **demystifying Buddhist practice and cutting through overcomplication**. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Message: The Dhamma is Simple**
*   The talk begins by addressing the overwhelming volume of Buddhist scriptures, lists, and scholarly knowledge. The central analogy is a teacher's note on an exam: **"Answer the questions, don't tell me everything you know."**
*   The Dhamma is presented as essentially simple and subtle, but our intellectual craving and desire for more information (comparing it to the "thirst for knowledge" from school) create confusion. The many suttas and teachings are all pointing to the same simple truths.

### **The Essence of Practice: "Remember to Look and to Change"**
*   The practice is distilled down to a fundamental, two-step loop:
    1.  **Remember to look** at what's happening in your mind in the present moment.
    2.  **Remember you have a choice** to change it to something more wholesome.
*   This is framed as **"remember to look and to gladden the mind."** The ultimate goal is to learn **"just to stop"**—to stop the mental proliferation and simply be at ease.

### **Cutting Through Complexity: The "Gordian Knot"**
*   A major theme is the danger of over-analysis. The speaker compares untangling complex doctrines to the legend of the **Gordian Knot**—instead of trying to unpick it, the solution is to **cut right through it**.
*   Applied to practice: instead of endlessly analyzing hindrances, doubts, or seeking the "root cause" of suffering, the solution is to **"throw that knot out and be happy."** You don't need all the answers to be at peace.

### **Working with Hindrances and States (Jhanas)**
*   **Hindrances are Interrelated:** The discussion cautions against getting stuck in identifying which specific hindrance (doubt, anger, restlessness) is present. They are all aspects of the same confused state—a "big bowl of yarn." The key is to see any unwholesome state and let it go.
*   **A Practical Approach to Anger:** Instead of fighting anger, simply notice it and think, **"It's okay that I'm angry."** That very recognition is a non-angry thought that begins the change.
*   **Jhanas Demystified:** The Jhanas are presented not as mystical, graded attainments to be coveted, but as **natural byproducts of a mind made "fit for work."** They are simply different aspects of paying attention (to thoughts, to joy, to equanimity). The real work is sustaining a wholesome mind; the Jhanas will happen on their own.

### **The Danger of Scholarship and Spiritual Materialism**
*   The talk warns against becoming a "garbage collector" of spiritual information. **Scholarship without practice is seen as a major hindrance.**
*   The desire for special experiences or attainments (like "awakening experiences" or Jhanas) can create a **"spiritual ego"** that leads to more suffering when the experience passes. The instruction is to **"never mind, start again"**—always return to the simple practice of gladdening the mind.

### **Powerful Analogies for Freedom**
*   The talk concludes by referencing the **"five similes for the hindrances"** (from the Suttas): being freed from prison, recovering from illness, being released from debt, completing a dangerous journey, and being freed from slavery.
*   The common taste of all these freedoms is **relief**. Letting go of a hindrance should feel like that—a simple, profound relief. The practice is about **tasting that freedom** now, not in some distant future.

### **In a Nutshell:**
This talk is a call to **radical simplicity**. It encourages practitioners to put down the heavy burden of intellectualizing Buddhism, to stop trying to "solve" the Dhamma like a puzzle, and to engage directly with the mind's present state. The path is summarized as: **See the unwholesome, choose the wholesome, taste the relief of letting go, and repeat.** Everything else is commentary.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about spiritual practice, simplicity, and overcoming mental hindrances. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The School Exam / "Answer the Question"**
    *   **What it is:** Speaker A's story about getting an "A-plus-minus" on a history exam with the note, *"Answer the questions, don't tell me everything you know."*
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that the Dharma (teaching) should be approached with "just enough" understanding. The goal isn't to accumulate endless knowledge (like memorizing all the Suttas) but to grasp and apply the essential, simple point.

2.  **The Gordian Knot**
    *   **What it is:** The ancient story of an impossibly tangled knot that no one could untie. Alexander the Great's solution was to cut it with his sword.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that over-intellectualizing and trying to "untangle" all our spiritual confusion is the wrong approach. The solution is to "cut through" the complexity with a simple, direct action: **stop** and let go.

3.  **The Tangled Mess (Fishing Line & Christmas Lights)**
    *   **What it is:** Extending the Gordian Knot idea to familiar, frustrating tangles like fishing line or last year's Christmas lights.
    *   **Purpose:** To make the point more relatable. Sometimes the best solution to a mental/emotional tangle is not to painstakingly unpick it, but to "throw it away" or "buy new lights"—i.e., discard the confused thinking entirely and start fresh with a simple practice.

4.  **Pushing the Car to Start It**
    *   **What it is:** The old-fashioned method of starting a car by pushing it to get it rolling, then jumping in to steer.
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the meditative process. The effort (pushing) is like the initial work of gladdening the mind or focusing on the breath (Anapanasati). Once the "car is rolling" (a positive state arises), you don't need to "jump in and try to control it"; you just need to keep the initial effort going ("stay in the back and keep pushing").

5.  **The Donut Addiction (Homer Simpson)**
    *   **What it is:** The analogy of loving donuts (gratification) despite knowing they cause diabetes and obesity (danger).
    *   **Purpose:** To explain our relationship with mental hindrances (anger, desire, etc.). We get short-term gratification from them but ignore the long-term suffering (Dukkha) they cause. The practice is recognizing the "danger" and moderating or eliminating the "donut" (the unwholesome thought pattern).

6.  **Weeding the Crack in the Pavement**
    *   **What it is:** Instead of tearing up the entire sidewalk to kill a weed's root, you simply cut it off at the surface each time it appears.
    *   **Purpose:** To correct the misconception that hindrances must be "uprooted" forever in one heroic effort. The practical method is to gently but consistently "whack off" the hindrance each time it arises. With no gratification, the "root" will eventually wither.

7.  **Autopilot vs. Conscious Attention**
    *   **What it is:** Contrasting cruising on autopilot (easy, gratifying) with the focused attention needed for takeoff, landing, or high-speed motorcycle racing.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain why we keep "crashing" into suffering. Life is complex and fast; going on "automatic pilot" (mindless habit) is dangerous. The practice requires continuous, conscious attention ("looking where you're going").

### **The Five Similes for Freedom (from Sutta 39)**
Speaker A recounts these five classic Buddhist similes to describe the **feeling of relief** when free from hindrances. They are presented as a set:

1.  **Recovering from Illness & Leaving the Hospital:** The relief of being well and free from sickness.
2.  **Being Released from Prison:** The relief of freedom after confinement.
3.  **Being Freed from Slavery:** The relief of no longer being a servant to a master (here, our own desires).
4.  **Getting Out of Debt:** The relief of being released from a burdensome obligation.
5.  **Completing a Dangerous Journey:** The relief of arriving safely home after a perilous trip.

*   **Overall Purpose:** To show that freedom from any hindrance, no matter which one, has the same essential taste: **relief and liberation.** This feeling is the reward of the practice.

### **Other Notable Metaphors & Phrases**

*   **"Just a little dab will do you." / "Just this next breath.":** Metaphors for sufficiency and present-moment focus.
*   **"Garbage Collectors / Garbage Scientists":** A metaphor for our tendency to collect and obsess over mental "garbage" (useless intellectual knowledge, past experiences).
*   **"A big bowl of yarn":** Speaker B's metaphor for the intertwined hindrances, where you might pull on one string (issue) to untangle the whole mess.
*   **"Never mind, start again.":** Framed as the "ultimate mantra" for meditation, capturing the simple act of letting go of distraction and returning to the breath.
*   **"When you get the message, hang up the phone."** (Quote from Alan Watts): Used to argue that once you understand the core teaching, you can stop seeking more information and just practice.

### **Summary**
The talk uses metaphors primarily to argue for **simplicity and direct experience over intellectual complexity.** The stories (Gordian Knot, exam, pushing the car) warn against overcomplication. The analogies (donuts, weeds, autopilot) provide practical models for dealing with hindrances. The five similes from the Suttas define the goal: not a mystical state, but the tangible, profound relief of being free from a burden. The overarching message is that the path is simpler than the seeking mind wants to believe.
