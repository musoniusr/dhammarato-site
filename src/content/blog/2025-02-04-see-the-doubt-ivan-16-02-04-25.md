### Transcript


**Speaker A:** The thing of it is, is that.

**Speaker B:** Even if you know why, that's not going to stop it. What you still have to do is stop it.

**Speaker C:** I see. Yeah, okay. So It doesn't really matter why it comes up. It matters if I stop it. That's what you said, right? Okay. Would it be wiser to just go to the feeling? I remember you always told us, you know, usually the feeling, if it's not understood, there will be questions and questions and questions. So the feeling is the place we go. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you have the right kind of feelings in the sense of feeling.

**Speaker A:** Safe and secure and comfortable, satisfied, but when you start to go, I'm missing.

**Speaker B:** Something, or I'm confused, or whatever, those kinds of thoughts are then going to lead you to the to the old kind of feelings, feelings of confusion, feelings of doubt, feelings of fear, being insecure. And so what we have to do is to see those unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Now, they may have a reason, you.

**Speaker B:** May have an excuse But archaeology is not going to change them. Knowing why only leads to a new why question.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's, uh, you know, I will say that this, this whole habit of me asking why, it's like Western psychology approaches, right? They have, I mean, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but they somehow encourage that sort of behavior, and I think that's funny. I feel like even in the practice, that's what we are trying to cultivate, right? Like, even if there's this urge to investigate, we always come back to the breath. Making a wholesome change, being right here right now, everything's fine. Uh, yeah. Oh yeah, I can see it. It's a, it's an old habit. Yeah, yeah. Uh, but, but From what I understand is the investigation is always left until the very last. Like, even after, let's say, I have, you know, 10-15 minutes of intentional.

**Speaker B:** Being.

**Speaker C:** With both of those, being right here right now, everything's fine. And, you know, let's say once the timer goes out, if the question is still there somehow then maybe I could start investigating. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

**Speaker A:** Well, um, the point that I keep.

**Speaker B:** Making is to look at every new thought that you have, every new thought that you have, because the wholesome thought that you put in there are going to be followed by unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** And the example that I have, you.

**Speaker B:** Explaining something and then you pop up with, maybe I'm wrong.

**Speaker A:** And you just let that maybe I'm wrong slide right by without even seeing that.

**Speaker B:** You said it right out loud.

**Speaker A:** You know that you said that right out loud, maybe I'm wrong. That's in fact the very last thing.

**Speaker B:** You said to me. Yes, maybe I'm wrong.

**Speaker A:** Instead of saying, aha, I see that.

**Speaker B:** See that when I'm saying maybe I'm wrong, because that's exactly what you're doing When you first called me, you were making that kind of statement in the sense of, yes, you can do the practice, you understand it, you're getting good value out of it. And then that thought, maybe I'm wrong, comes up.

**Speaker A:** In fact, I can't think of a better way of saying it. That, that's actually quite excellent.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Ivan, for saying that maybe I'm wrong. Now what we need for you to do then is for you to start looking for those maybe I'm wrong thoughts. Yeah, maybe I'm wrong. Did I get that?

**Speaker A:** By the way, from every student.

**Speaker B:** And that's every time you call, it's because of that. You can do the practice and then.

**Speaker A:** You'Ll have an unwholesome thought and you don't see it and you get confused.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You keep coming back with that statement.

**Speaker A:** Maybe I'm wrong.

**Speaker B:** It's deeply ingrained.

**Speaker C:** I just realized this sort of mental habit, at least from my observation, is prevalent not just in beginners, even in long-time practitioners. They have these habits, right? Like, maybe this is wrong. But yeah, I see that.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker C:** Well, my question— over and over.

**Speaker B:** Again, we have to keep looking and saying, never mind, maybe I'm wrong, never mind, let me continue to practice, let me feel good. Let me feel safe and secure and comfortable, and then that thought, maybe I'm.

**Speaker A:** Wrong, will come up. Aha, I see that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You have to start practicing really, really consistently. You have to catch every thought.

**Speaker B:** Keep coming back to looking, begin to.

**Speaker A:** Look for maybe I'm wrong kind of thought.

**Speaker C:** Yes. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Uh, So, kind of thought of, aha, I can do this. Yes, I can do this. I have been doing it. I can continue to do it. And I can catch those thoughts, maybe I'm wrong. Aha, I see you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Um, but these are very easy instructions. But.

**Speaker A:** Um, the mind is such that you think that basically we have the thought, maybe I'm wrong, and then you believe that thought. Why can't you believe the thoughts of, wow, this is great, I can do this? You don't quite believe it yet, but in fact you know it's true because you have the direct evidence, but you still doubt it. So watch for those doubting. Hey, watch for that doubting. What? Begin to see that.

**Speaker C:** It's true.

**Speaker B:** Uh, you're sabotaging your own practice by.

**Speaker A:** Not seeing that, that I've told you over and over again. It's very difficult for the practitioner to have a wholesome thought and another wholesome thought followed by an unwholesome thought. We have to be able to have a wholesome thought and another wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** And another wholesome thought and another wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Thought. One after another after another. And the mind is going to try to immediately revert back to its old habits, its old patterns. You have a wholesome thought and a.

**Speaker B:** Wholesome thought, and then you say, maybe I'm wrong. And so we can.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I also, you know, maybe it's just me trying to clarify something. Like, I found that to be true because I was reflecting on what you said in one of your videos. You said, you know, if a practitioner doesn't practice having wholesome thoughts, the unwholesome thoughts will come back with a vengeance. And it is true for me in a sense that if I'm not nurturing If I just, uh, I don't know, like, if I like that nurturing part, it's everything's okay, everything's right, this is all right, it's okay, uh, sometimes it comes back with a vengeance. Uh, you know, when it comes to this doubt, this hindrances, I, I have I was wondering, because is it in seeing the hindrances that's the first step towards the path, like what Buddha has said, or was it cleaning out the hindrances is the first step towards the path? Like, which one is it? Is it seeing it, or is it cleaning it? I mean, like throwing it out. Which one is it?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's clear that the doubt— it's clearly the doubt. That's the main hindrance, by the way, for almost all Westerners. It's not the only one, but it's the primary one. That that's in fact what you said comes from doubt. Maybe I'm wrong. That's the doubt. And the practice that I keep pushing.

**Speaker A:** Back for you to do, uh, Ivan, is to see those thoughts of doubt. Yeah, because the practice is quite easy.

**Speaker B:** To do, and if you do it and do it and do it and do it and build up on that, that'll work. But do it and do it, and then that will come. And you'll believe the doubt, or you know you can do it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Um, uh, Well, it's just, yeah, you know, maybe sometimes I'm not guarding my mind. Someone said something, some practitioner in the Sangha, not going to name who, say something and it kind of conflicts with how I see the Dharma, and I start to have questions. Even though my practice was going well. That's a funny thing. So, you know, I have questions because of what they said, and I start questioning even though there's no need to, you know, like even though everything's okay. So, uh, yeah, I mean, this part of my problem— I don't trust myself enough. Like because of what they said. And yeah, this is how I am. Sometimes I'm easily influenced.

**Speaker B:** Here's what we need to— here's what you need to start doing right now. I can do this.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** Because I still hear the shades of doubt in there. So let's just keep going with I can do this. I can feel good. I can catch that doubt. And have that really not necessarily a positive but a much more realistic way of seeing things is you can do this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the doubt keeps coming back, but never mind, start again.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, those— there's no need to get it right, right? Like, I can be wrong and that's okay. Like I can't.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't— Wrong.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, I see that. Aha, I'm not wrong. I can do this.

**Speaker C:** So would it be fair to say, well, it's okay if I'm wrong. I don't need to call Dhammarato. I can just keep practicing.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** You can keep— Right, you can start again. Just start again. It's okay to call me. But more importantly, can you call out your doubt? Can you see the doubt? I can see that.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see that doubt. And the way that you stated it.

**Speaker B:** Just maybe I'm wrong. So see those thoughts of maybe I'm wrong as Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see that.

**Speaker B:** And we practice that over and over.

**Speaker A:** Again, and eventually the doubt will mellow out. But as long as you give that doubt power it's going to keep coming back and coming back. So stop doubting yourself. You can do this. Start having that real attitude, that I can do this attitude.

**Speaker C:** It's, uh, I think what fuels the doubt is also I mean, I need to allow myself to have more patience, I suppose. Like, sometimes I can be very judgmental about myself.

**Speaker A:** Well, be on guard. That's the whole point, is that you.

**Speaker B:** Let yourself fall into the doubt.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Let yourself fall into the doubt. You've been doubting for so long that.

**Speaker B:** You don't even see it as a habit.

**Speaker C:** I mean, I do see it as habit. It's just sometimes I don't know when is it okay to have it, but.

**Speaker B:** I think it's not okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can't stop it from coming up, but you can catch it when it comes up. You can't stop it from coming up, but you can catch it if you start guarding yourself to guard those thoughts. Aha, I caught you, Mr. Doubt! And now I'm going to come back and I'm going to feel good because I know I can feel good. And I'm not going to feel, uh, the way that the doubt wants me to feel, which is confused.

**Speaker C:** It's, uh, yeah, taking it light and easy. Yeah, I just, I don't know, sometimes take it a bit too seriously, the practice. If, you know, I have a choice to be more— take it more light and easy. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do admit I make it confusing for myself, uh, because just serious attitude sometimes, like, it's— yeah, not sure what to say. Yeah, it's, it's just, it's just doubt. Yeah, it's just overthinking fear. I wanted to get it right. Same thing.

**Speaker A:** It's, uh, yeah, I wanted to get it right. Is this, is this right? So long as we want it because we're wanting something.

**Speaker B:** Instead, just trust you can do it right. Keep trusting you can do it right. And when those feelings.

**Speaker A:** Those doubts come back. Aha, I see that.

**Speaker B:** It's a very easy instruction, but you have to keep doing it. You have to keep doing it.

**Speaker C:** Uh, um, yeah, yeah, repetition again and again. Yeah, it's also like this attitude of this is okay, right? Like even if the doubt come out, I mean, I'm not— it's not like I'm welcoming it, but just the attitude of, yeah, it's okay. Like I see that doubt, it's okay.

**Speaker A:** Just no problem, just keep practicing. Out when you have that thought. Maybe I'm wrong. Aha, I see that. Yeah, and be happy that you can.

**Speaker B:** See it rather than trying to get rid of— don't try to get rid of it, but every time it comes up, you can be happy that you can see it.

**Speaker C:** That's the, uh, Yeah, that's the Sati in training, right? The able to wake up and see it, that's the part we keep training over and over. Is this a Samsara? Like sometimes I like to say that this professionism Samskara.

**Speaker A:** Why? Because you have been piling on the doubt your whole life. You've got a whole big pile of doubt all built up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a big problem.

**Speaker A:** Keep coming up, that doubt is going to keep coming up. For you, Ivan. Don't buy into it when it comes up. Don't be that doubt, but rather see that doubt. Aha, I see you, that you're not the doubt. You identify with the doubt. I may be wrong. Identifying with the doubt.

**Speaker C:** Yes. Instead, I could say, huh, that's the.

**Speaker B:** Doubt that comes up.

**Speaker A:** Instead, you can say, aha, I see that. I see that doubt. I am not the doubt.

**Speaker C:** I can also say, like, huh, there's a feeling of doubt. Right, but not saying it's mine. It's just a feeling.

**Speaker B:** It's just a feeling.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Feel the way you want to. The feelings are not you. That you are not the doubt. The doubt is not you.

**Speaker B:** And see it, you have a chance to change it. Is, uh, so this is the way we're going to practice. This is a new aspect of your practice, is to look for the doubt.

**Speaker C:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Right now, I mean, while we're talking, you start looking for those doubtful thoughts.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I'm already was looking at it 10 minutes ago, but yeah, it's, uh, it's gonna be a fun game, Dhammarato. There's gonna be a lot of things.

**Speaker A:** Right up on you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Those sneak right up on.

**Speaker B:** You, start watching for the dots even while we're talking. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** It says, uh, you know, yeah, it is a Samskara, but sometimes I was thinking it's also like a Kamma, right? Like, I mean, Kamma is basically habit, so yeah, I guess it's the same thing.

**Speaker B:** It is. It's an— and that's— Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in that sense, okay, that, that, um, actions and then actions again are reactions. And so every time that you have.

**Speaker A:** A wholesome thought, you'll have that reaction to it of maybe this is not.

**Speaker B:** Correct, maybe I'm wrong. And so that's an action, and it's also a Samskara.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it doesn't even matter that you label it. What matters is, can you see it in the sense of, aha, I see you and I'm going to change right now. I'm not going to get stuck in that doubt. I want to be happy. Yeah, aha, I see you. I'm really glad that I can see you. I don't have to label you. I can label you as Samskara. I can label you as is Kamma, or I could just simply say, 'Aha, I see you,' then drop it, change it. Be happy that you can see it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just maybe this is a concept, but it's really helpful for me. Because, you know, sometimes I see like ending this Kamma is basically relaxing, like just dropping it all, like taking a nice deep breath, everything's okay. That's me stopping it from like, you know, further actions, just cooling it down, like this is okay, I'm okay. At least that's how I've been thinking about that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, can you do this now? Are you sure you can do this? You can do it.

**Speaker C:** I can.

**Speaker A:** All right, you go.

**Speaker B:** Wait, wait, no, just see this down.

**Speaker A:** Arahant.

**Speaker B:** Mr. Doubt.

**Speaker C:** Okay, okay. I mean, it's funny, like, even it's like the moment you say, okay, you can do it now, and then I was like, wait, wait, wait, one more, and then I just, okay, I see that now.

**Speaker A:** What I'm talking about, huh? Right. Aha, I can see it in your face.

**Speaker B:** You can see it when it comes up. You're beginning to look at that.

**Speaker A:** That's excellent. I'm really glad that we had this moment. I can't do it.

**Speaker C:** I feel like you're intentionally poking me to have that Anagami. And I was like, okay, fine, I have to. I gotta go do it.

**Speaker A:** Arya. So now that you've seen it one time, you keep looking for it. Keep looking for those negative thoughts that keep popping up. Yeah, that's really great. Congratulations, Ivan, you were able to see it that time.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay, it's gonna be a fun game.

**Speaker B:** You start congratulating yourself.

**Speaker A:** I see that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I can also like, you know, instead of— I mean, yeah, I see that it's nice, but I can also like, oh, this is a nice breath right now, it's okay, like, this is really nice right now. That's the wholesome change too, right? That just building it up more and more.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's finish the call now.

**Speaker B:** You've got to go look for it. I'm sure that you can do this.

**Speaker C:** Okay, that was a little—.

**Speaker B:** Just practicing. I know you can do this. You can— you just saw it. I saw you see it. Yeah, so you keep looking at it. All right, so we'll see you later.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you, Dhammarato. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all righty, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A/B) with a student named Ivan (Speaker C), focuses on a core obstacle in meditation practice—**doubt**—and how to work with it skillfully. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: The Habit of Doubt**
- Ivan’s mind habitually generates thoughts like **“Maybe I’m wrong,”** which sabotage his practice.
- This doubt is identified as a primary hindrance for many Western practitioners—a deep-seated **samskara** (mental conditioning) or **kamma** (habitual action).
- The talk emphasizes that intellectual investigation into *why* the doubt arises is not the solution. As Dhammarato states: “Archaeology is not going to change them. Knowing why only leads to a new why question.”

### **The Practice: Catching and Replacing Unwholesome Thoughts**
1. **Guard the Mind:** Be vigilant toward every new thought. After a wholesome thought (e.g., “I can do this”), the mind often automatically produces an unwholesome one (“Maybe I’m wrong”). The task is to **catch it as it arises**.
2. **Recognize, Don’t Identify:** See the doubt with mindfulness: **“Aha, I see you, doubt.”** Do not identify with it (“I am doubtful”). Instead, note it as a passing mental event: “There’s a feeling of doubt.”
3. **Make a Wholesome Change:** After seeing the doubt, deliberately return to a wholesome, calming thought or feeling. Examples:
   - “I can do this.”
   - “Everything is okay right now.”
   - “I feel safe, secure, and comfortable.”
   - Focusing on a pleasant breath.
4. **Build Momentum:** The goal is to string together **wholesome thoughts repeatedly**, weakening the old habit of doubt. Each time you catch and replace doubt, you build positive mental momentum.

### **Important Nuances**
- **Don’t Suppress, See:** The instruction isn’t to fight or suppress doubt, but to **see it clearly** and then consciously choose a different, wholesome mental object.
- **Lighten Up:** Ivan acknowledges he sometimes takes practice too seriously. The attitude should be light, easy, and kind: “It’s okay if doubt arises. I can see it and start again.”
- **Trust Yourself:** The doubt often comes from not trusting one’s own experience and being overly influenced by others’ opinions or conflicting Dharma interpretations. The remedy is to trust the direct evidence of your practice.
- **Celebrate Success:** Congratulate yourself when you see the doubt—it’s a moment of mindfulness (*sati*). Be happy you woke up to it.

### **Conclusion**
The talk reframes working with doubt as a **“fun game”** of hide-and-seek with the mind. The essential instruction is simple but requires relentless repetition: **Guard the mind, catch the doubt, see it without identifying, and gently return to a wholesome, calming anchor.** This process trains the mind to dwell more in wholesome states and frees it from the compulsive cycle of self-sabotaging doubt.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Archaeology" or "Why Digging" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The practice of constantly asking "why" about negative thoughts or feelings is compared to an archaeological dig.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate that digging into the past causes of a problem (the "why") is endless and unproductive. As Speaker B says, *"Knowing why only leads to a new why question."* The goal is not to excavate the root cause but to change the present pattern.

**2. The "Saboteur" or "Hijacker" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The mind's habit of doubt (specifically "maybe I'm wrong") is portrayed as an internal saboteur that undermines wholesome progress.
*   **Purpose:** To personify the automatic, unhelpful thought pattern. The instruction is to catch this saboteur in the act: *"Aha, I see you, Mara"* and *"You're sabotaging your own practice."*

**3. The "Guard at the Gate" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The practice of mindfulness is described as being a vigilant guard who watches every thought.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize the need for constant, gentle vigilance. The practitioner must *"look at every new thought,"* *"be on guard,"* and *"catch every thought"* to prevent unwholesome thoughts from slipping in unnoticed.

**4. The "Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thought Chain" Story**
*   **What it is:** A narrative about how the mind operates in sequences. A wholesome thought (e.g., "I can do this") is often automatically followed by an unwholesome one (e.g., "maybe I'm wrong").
*   **Purpose:** To map the mental habit pattern. The goal of the practice is to break the chain and build a new one: *"We have to be able to have a wholesome thought and another wholesome thought and another wholesome thought."*

**5. The "Pile of Doubt" / "Samskara" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A lifetime of habitual doubt is compared to a big pile or a deeply ingrained mental formation (Samskara).
*   **Purpose:** To explain why the doubt is so persistent and automatic. *"You've got a whole big pile of doubt all built up... it's going to keep coming up."* This frames it as a conditioned habit, not a personal truth.

**6. The "Fun Game" or "Catch the Thought" Story**
*   **What it is:** Speaker C reframes the practice as a "fun game" of catching the doubting thought.
*   **Purpose:** To shift the attitude towards the practice from one of serious, heavy striving to one of light, playful observation. This makes the vigilant "guarding" feel less like a chore and more like an engaging activity.

**7. The "Vengeance" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Speaker C recalls a teaching that if wholesome thoughts aren't nurtured, *"the unwholesome thoughts will come back with a vengeance."*
*   **Purpose:** To highlight the importance of actively cultivating a positive mental environment. Neglect allows the old, negative habits to return stronger.

**Summary of Core Narrative:**
The talk tells a **story of mental habit change**. The old story is: "I have a problem (doubt) → I must find its root cause (archaeology) → I get stuck in analysis." The new story, taught through these metaphors, is: "A doubting thought arises (the saboteur) → I spot it immediately (the vigilant guard) → I acknowledge it without identifying with it ('I see that,' 'the doubt is not me') → I consciously choose to return to a wholesome thought ('I can do this') → I build a new chain of wholesome thoughts → I lighten up and make it a game."
