### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, friends. This is Saturday morning in Thailand, Friday afternoon or evening in the US. And today we're going to talk about— basically, we're going to talk about what was practiced in the time of the Buddha that was actually not then part of his teachings. And that the reason that we want to do that This is because most Western Buddhists like to read, and they read and they read and they read. And when they read about the stuff that was happening in the time of the Buddha, that the Buddha himself tried out and found to be not functional, not liberating, then the Westerners will say, okay, me too. If the Buddha did it, I'm going to do it. Now what that means is, is that if they would actually listen to what the Buddha taught, then they would go directly to the Noble Path. That direct is the actual word. It's, uh, the word itself is.

**Speaker B:** Uh.

**Speaker A:** Uh, Jhana Mago, the direct pathway. And yet the Westerners have gotten involved in what is called Ekagatha, which is concentrated or one-pointedness of mind. And now there was a lot of practices during the time of the Buddha that various religions, rishis, Anagami, wanderers, um, Saddhas, other guys, um, were practicing these things, especially with the Jains, um, where— who were into various austerities, uh, but some of the methods that they would use actually do help bringing on direct, uh, concentration. And in fact, they would use some of these techniques to get into various deep mental states that we can call Jhana. Now, the first thing that we'll talk about would be kasina meditations. I'm sure that several of you have heard about the kasina, and basically what kasina meditations are is kinds of visualization. They use a lot of the visual part of the brain for the casinos. There were actually 10 in all. The ones that were practiced, let us say, to get started would be what is called Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. The air meditations wound up— people would just lay on their backs and look at the sky, look at the sky at night, see the stars. And you could say then that using kasina air meditations is what gave rise to astronomy, astrology, and meteorology. And so we can thank those guys for doing the old kasina meditations. But now modern scientists, they don't just lay on their back and look at the sky. They've got all kinds of equipment and telescopes and James Webs and all of this kind of stuff. But this is where it got started. The Earth meditations were generally done by taking a mud disc that was about a foot across, odd shapes, but mostly somewhere between a square and a circle. And that what they would do is just look at that square of mud and then close their eyes and then open their eyes again and then close their eyes. And as they would close their eyes, then they would try to visualize what was on that mud kasina, a mud disk. And then they would open their eyes to fill in the gaps so that they could, let us say, memorize things very well. Now, this actually brings up a quality. It's a skill that can be developed, and that skill that can be developed we would call photographic memory. Now, some people have it naturally. In fact, nowadays about the only people who do have it are those who probably didn't even know they were developing it when they were a kid is something like perfect pitch, that some people have really perfect pitch, but many of the musicians that I know could at least name a few notes, especially A, because we tuned on A. And so that note would get stuck in the mind. The same thing with these visual kasinas is that, for instance, the stargazers the Arhant would actually be able to memorize the sky so that they begin to see that it was moving. If they hadn't memorized it from what they were looking at last night, then how would they know that the thing was actually moving? And so this is because they didn't have any photographs, they didn't have any drawings, didn't have any paper to write on. So this is two of the Kasinas. A third Kasina would be what is called water. Now, one of the best places for getting information about the water meditation was done by Hermann Hesse, who wrote Siddhartha. How many of you have ever heard of that novel? At the end of the novel, Hermann Hesse had Siddhartha as what he called a ferryman, a boatman. And that he would just sit and look at the water, gaze into the water. This has been done. People, in fact, surfers, they watch the water. Is that not true, Scott? They get into that water meditation, looking at the condition of the water, watching it move, etc., like that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then the fourth one, uh, is the one that's the most interesting, is what is called the fire meditation. Now, the fire meditation, or the kasina, fire kasina, means that they, uh, in the old days, they would probably sit around a campfire, but then candles were invented, or oil lamps. In fact, they didn't have candles in the time of the Buddha, but they did have oil lamps where they would have the oil and the wick. Normally the oil bowl was made out of mud, and so the mud bowl that you would have for the candle became part of the lore because the mud of the candle holder would get saturated with oil. And yet even though the candle bowl was still oily, it didn't have enough oil to saturate the wick in order to make the flame. So while they were watching this flame, maybe just a little flame, one about this size here, the size of a candle flame, they would watch it and then they would close their eyes and see that they, like the others that I've talked about— I haven't mentioned the word, but the word is nimitta, which means an image. Now, the candle meditation, it's very easy to get the image. All of you probably have the memory or the example of looking at a fluorescent bulb or a light, because you use those every evening, and then after you look at the light, you close your eyes or look away, that light is still there. Or if you look into the sun, for sure, if you look into the sun, it's going to actually burn a hole in your eye, and that then becomes the nematode. So They were very big on nimittas during the time of the Buddha, but the Buddha's practice with that stuff, he saw that it had nothing to do with the questions that he was looking for the answers for, that these were just practices. And people would get all concentrated in everything, but they did not develop discernment. And we'll talk about that. In just a moment. But continue on. By the way, the Kasina meditations— there's a very famous one that happened, a retreat where many at that time famous meditation teachers gathered in Georgia for a 10-day Kasina meditation retreat. In fact, I just posted a bit about that on discord, where instead of them all sitting around the candle flame burning their eye out, they got into arguments about how to do it. This is Western Buddhism for you. They would rather get it right before they get any of it at all, as opposed to actual practice, right? Go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker D:** I was just agreeing with you. A lot of people get involved in debating each other and quarreling about, no, this is what the Buddha said, and no, this is the real teaching, and no, this is more accurate, you misunderstand it. But if we look at what the Buddha teaches in the sutta, he teaches Dhamma, that when practiced, you don't quarrel or fight with anybody.

**Speaker A:** Because it's easy to understand. Yeah, when practiced. If you want to hear about it but don't practice it, then there's all kinds of hindrances and doubts and arguments and all kinds of things that come up, right? When you practice what the Buddha taught, then you can see directly for yourself. It says.

**Speaker B:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** And then see for yourself. Come and practice directly what the Buddha taught. So continuing on with the kasinas, the next group of them— we've covered 4 so far— the next group of kasinas is also in 4, and these are colored kasinas. Now, one of the points that I'd like to make about the Pali language is that the word for green and the word for blue is the same word. Now, part of the reason for that is because the only real blue that you'll find in nature is of two places that I know of. One is that the sky is blue when it's not cloudy. The other place is duck poop. Ducks have a dark goo. In fact, the the poo of the duck would be where they would get the pigment for dyeing clothes in the very early times to have blue clothing. But the kasina would not have been blue. It was green. And yet all the translators use the word blue. There is no blue kasina. It's a green kasina. And the green actually comes from that one of the kasinas that they would do is they would take and stitch leaves of a tree together. And these leaves then, as they washed it over several months' time, the leaves would turn from green to yellow to a reddish color. And so these reddish colors are actually old kasinas, and a green kasina would be a new one. But what they do is that they sit and they watch the leaves, noticing that the leaves themselves have veins and other things like that, so that they would memorize what that kasina looks like, concentrating the mind, focusing, narrowing down, looking deeply. The last two would be more advanced kasinas. One of them that they would have is the color white. Now, when they talk about the white color, what they're actually talking about is what happens to your eyes, like at night when you close your eyes and still look. When you're looking at the eye but the eye is closed, what do you see? What do you see, Alex, when you close your eyes and look through the eyes? What do you see? Do you see blackness with a lot of patchy little white things that are moving around, or sometimes they're stable, look like clouds or maybe stars? Maybe one of them will fire and you'll see a star pop up and other things like that. Have you ever practiced that?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you know what that is, but you also know that it's constantly changing. All right, that's one of the casinos. Another casino, surprisingly enough, would be consciousness. But your mind must be very, very still In fact, a better way of using it would not be consciousness arises because the consciousness is already there in some form or another, but it changes. And so a thought will come up, or maybe a piece or a tiny little bit of a thought will come up, or maybe in noticing something will show up. This would be called the consciousness casino. But as I was saying, all of these things were practiced in the time of the Buddha, and the Buddha practiced them too and found that they were not liberating. Why? Because they were focusing down. They were closing down. They were, in fact, what you could call concentrating. So before we finish with the kasinas, does anybody have anything to say about them? Practices that you've done, questions that you have, something like that. Yeah. It feels more relaxing overall. Kasinas, it's like, tensing up the body. Pardon? Just practicing satisfaction feels more relaxed overall. Like kasinas, they tense up the body. Yes, that's true. That's exactly right. Why? Because people who are practicing kasina meditations do so because they want something. That's a good observation. It's not necessarily relaxing. Santiago, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** Nope.

**Speaker A:** All is well. All is well. Okay. If you have never done Kasina meditations, congratulations. Go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Oh, I was just laughing with you, but I have done a fire kasina, the new version of fire kasina, I guess you may say, which is the flashlight on the phone. You can use that to blind your eye or whatever you want and use that as the nimitta. I thought I'd bring that up.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I guess the kids have something, a new toy to play with. To blind yourself with a cell phone flashlight.

**Speaker D:** I enjoy gazing at fire. So not necessarily trying to close my eyes and have a magical experience. But just looking at fire and just watching it shift and dance around, it can be mesmerizing and get— yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's why the fire meditation is so popular. But in fact, you can imagine this, that the kids are at camp and they're sitting along, sitting around the campfire, and somebody's strumming on this guitar and they're singing something like Kumbaya. And while they're all sitting there gazing into the fire, they stop singing and start fire gazing. Fire gazing is something that is done. It is mesmerizing, the snap, crackle, and pop of the things that happen in a fire. Yeah. Or in a candle, they're dancing. But the light of a cell phone is pretty darn steady. It's hard to sit there and watch your battery go dead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that wouldn't be fun.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's move on then to other things that they practiced in the time of the Buddha, basically in conjunction with this. One of them would be the austerities, and the Buddha was really into the austerities. This is where we get the image of the starving Buddha. Actually, he wasn't a Buddha then. He was a Bodhisattva, and he was starving himself with these austerities. Go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker D:** I was going to ask you, so I know that the Hindus had their own form of breathing meditation. They had Pranayama, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** So what's the difference What would be the difference between pranayama and Anapanasati?

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati, the whole point is to learn to control the mind a bit so that you actually can breathe in long and deep. But the point of those two things would be to experience and know the body. With the intention of relaxing the body. To where often pranayama yoga is when they suck in their tummy, get really strange and that like that. So you could say that pranayama, especially pranayama yoga, winds up being a competition of who can do it the most weird. Yeah, yeah. And in fact, I think in the time of the Buddha there was a lot of spiritual competition, spiritual materialism going on.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, the other thing that they had in the time of the Buddha, uh, we could call now concentration meditations that actually fit in with the casino, fits in with the Prajna breathing, and also fits in with what we know of the term Jhana, that the Buddha in fact practiced Jhana as far as they could go and found that that was not what he was looking for. Well, that's very interesting. If the Buddha said that he practiced the Jhanas all the way up to the fourth Jhana, all the way up to nothingness, all the way up to neither perception nor non-perception, and he found no value directly in that. Why is it then that the Western people, the Western Buddhists, are lusting after Jhana? Really strange, huh? Especially since they wind up being disappointed. They wind up wanting more and more and more, and they never get satisfied with it. And that a lot of them get that because they say, oh, well, I've heard that Samatha meditation or calmness is part of the Jhana. And we've already done what we call Vipassana or dry meditation, and we're not getting anything out of that. And so all the many of the Vipassana people then want to go to try Jhana. So that they can get the other half. But both of these are then not what the Buddha taught at all. Then in fact, the story is in Sutta number 36, where the Buddha says, tells the story of how he fell into a creek and couldn't get out. This is in his starving days when he starved himself to death. Or nearly to death, becoming kind of a stick figure, where he recognized that he didn't have the strength to even get out of the creek that he was in. And so he grabbed ahold of some branches from a tree and eventually pulled himself out. And there, sitting under that tree, he started to muse, what have I been doing? Look at all the practices. And the stories go that he was the very best at every one of the practices. Whatever practice he had, he did it better than anybody else could. Now that's an important point, because everybody's wanting to get those kind of states, and the Buddha found them not to be useful. And while he was sitting under that tree, he remembered and mused that when he was a teenager, he was sitting under a rose apple tree And in under that rose apple tree, he came to practice the first Jhana. And then he had the idea that, oh, the first Jhana is in fact the path that I'm looking for. And so he crawled himself out and he took some food. The story is, is that from a cowherd maiden, he got rice milk. And the rice and the milk that he was taking got him, uh, pretty fat very quickly, especially since he was starving himself to death. And when he was getting really fat very quickly, his companions didn't like that at all. They thought that he had quit the practice completely, and so they left. So that left him alone, and this was in the area of Bodh Gaya. Now Bodhgaya actually was the home area of the, um, uh, the Jains. This is where they lived, was in that eastern part of, uh, uh, Bihar, uh, in, in India. And so, um, that's where he found himself. And this place called— now called Bodhgaya was actually a swamp. It was a river swamp, and it was full of snakes, crocodiles, and bugs and all kinds of stuff. But that's where he was when he got there, and so that's where he stayed. And he stayed there, they say the story is, about 6 weeks. Now, in that 6-week period, he put together several things from what he already knew. An example of that was the Four Noble Truths actually comes from Arya Vedic medicine, to where you have a disease, you've got a cause of the disease, you have the cure for the disease, and then you have the potion to the medicine that cures that disease. He took those four things and turned it into the Four Noble Truths. He also took the four elements that we had from the Kasina meditations— the earth, the water, the fire, and the air— and turned those from the outside of a real Kasina, a real fire, a real sky-watching, to the inside. So that he had the body, the feelings, the mind states, and the floating mental objects. So there's your earth, fire, water, and air. Much of the language that he used, he derived from the local languages. And if we understand how those words were used, you can see how the Buddha grabbed some of those words and made modifications to it. One of those words was Arya. Another one was Brahman, that the Brahmins were birthed— Brahman were born in a family or in a clan, and they were the priest. But he says, no, a real Brahman is one who has a change of lineage in his mind and is no longer a Brahman by birth, but he's Brahman by his actions, his thoughts, his behavior. The same was, uh, was the word for, um, Aryan. Now, he was actually in the Aryan clan himself. The Sakians were part of the Aryans, which would be considered, uh, in modern times, uh, the era, the aristocrats, uh, the nobles, the warriors. And so his family was of that clan, and he, uh changed the word from the Aryan in the sense of Aryan by birth into Aryan means your behavior, your thoughts, your presence. And so he talked about a change of lineage, to change from your birth lineage into a noble lineage of the mind. So he also, in that 6-week period, put together— in fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about this quite a lot because it's actually in the Udana ancient literature where the Buddha put together the Paticcasamuppada and came up with the concept of iti appapajayata, that everything is caused from a causation, that everything that you see is the effect of some kind of cause, and that the entire universe is operated in this cause and effect. Giving rise to the concept of Anicca. Everything is in flux, everything is constant. And so this became part of the root teachings that he gave, and he came up with this, this plan. And the plan is basically, if we want to use it in very few words, we can say it's the noble middle path, that everything goes to the middle, that these austerities that the Jains were practicing was one extreme, and these high Jhanas that he was also practicing was just another extreme. But the first Jhana, which is a happy, joyful, beautiful state where the mind is free from hindrances is actually the middle path. And he also devised several methods for bringing about this middle path, which now has become known to be the first Jhana. And so when people generally talk about Jhanas in plural, they're actually referring to the very high Jhanas Because there is a major, major distinction between the first jhana and the other jhanas, because the other jhanas have focus of concentration of the mind, to where the first jhana has to do with organization of the mind. So he actually then began to change the definition of the word Samadhi from concentration into the word Samatha, which has to do with mental organization, that what we're doing is that we're focusing only enough to focus out the unwholesome, so that we keep the mind active, so that we can investigate, we can see, we can make discernments, but we're not stopping the mind. The kasina meditations and the higher jhanas were all used to stop the mind Well, how are you going to learn anything that way? How are you going to be able to discern what's an unwholesome thought versus a wholesome thought if the mind is stuck in not much of anything at all? And in fact, I've just seen it recently, a joke on Discord where the cop is pulling somebody over and saying, ah, I see you driving under the influence of Jhana. A DWJ, because you can't drive a car. Now, you can drive a car easily enough if you're, um, in first Jhana. Then in fact, if you're in first Jhana, that makes you a very, very excellent driver. Why? Because you're paying attention. You're not all thinking about driving. You're actually driving. You're actually focused and paying attention to what's real. We don't get sidetracked by the billboards or the ladies on the side of the road or anything like that. We're actually watching the road. Well, when we come out of the car and are sitting, what is First Jhana then is when you're watching the road of the mind. You're watching the activities of the mind. You're seeing what's going on. You're paying attention, wise reflection. Now, the wise reflection that the Buddha was interested in was being able to see when unwholesome thoughts, which can also be called hindrances, which can also be called dissatisfactions or Dukkha. This is a whole group of stuff that's on that side of the fence of unhappiness. And we can change that by looking, by discerning. And so this is what the Eightfold Noble Path is really all about, and it's well expounded in Sutta number 117 when he talks about firstly what is right view. And he talks about right view in the frame of What is wrong view? Wrong view means that there are no spiritual people, no mothers and daddies, no rules, no laws, that you can do anything, you can get away with any activity. Which means then that this is the point of view of a psychopath or a crook. Does somebody have something to say? I didn't see. Never mind. Okay, and then right ordinary view is from the parents' perspective of, oh no, you can't get away with it. We're going to have priests, we're going to have, um, uh, police, we're going to have, uh, teachers, we're going to have, uh, people out there watching so that if you do something, you can't get away with it. This is what brings in the Hindu version of the law of Kamma, is that you can't get away with it. Well, every bit— every smart kid knows they could get away with it. How many times did you, each one of you, shoplift before you got caught? And then maybe after you got caught, because they were so lenient on you, they continued to shoplift, and you stole all kinds of things. Before you figured out that it was not a wise thing to do. Same thing with telling lies. We tell all kinds of lies and get away with it. We've been telling lies since we were kids. In fact, we learned how to lie from our parents. They got away with it. So when the, uh, uh, let's say the church ladies come in, they're saying, oh no, you can't get away with it. We're going to make a religion so that eventually you're going to go to hell for all the lying and the shoplifting that you've done. They try to make it kind of permanent. But the Buddha could see that we do not in fact know the outcome of our behavior, even bad behavior. That some are actually quite sharp at shoplifting. They can shoplift their whole life long and never get caught. All kinds of ways to In fact, this is why Walmart has begun to put cameras. They've had cameras now for about 20 years. And yet, if they were really smart, they'd put a camera in every nook and corner of their entire place, because the shoplifters know to just put the stuff in the basket and then go to a place in the store where there's no cameras. And that's when they take it and put it in their pocket where the cameras can't see you. So there's all kinds of ways of getting away with it. And in fact, look at Donald Trump. He's a crook. He's a criminal. He's a proven criminal. He's a sexual abuser, and yet he's gotten away with it. Why do you like that? So right noble view— or excuse me, right ordinary view— doesn't work. You can't tell, you can't police the world. And yet look at how much the Christians, or even Islam, they try to police the world. They make all kinds of rules—no abortions, no LGBT, no being brown, all of that kind of stuff—and yet it happens anyway. They can't make rules or laws against it. But seeing Now, what then does it do? There is another way of looking. It's not a worldview, but it is in fact an observation. Looking to where I can get away with it is a worldview. You can't get away with it is a worldview. But look at what you're doing right now is not a worldview, it's actually discernment, it's actual observation. Now one of the things about kasinas and jhanas and austerities and all of that kind of stuff that they practiced, they practiced that stuff in order for someday out in the future that they would get some results. This is all ordinary right view. To where if you are practicing discernment and you can see what's happening right now, then you can use right noble effort to come out of that right now. This is why the Buddha talks about it as the direct method. You can come out of your Dukkha that you're having right now immediately just by changing your attitude, changing your mind. This is all built right into the Eightfold Noble Path. So this is actually the practice, and he gave the practice of Anapanasati. And one of the beautiful parts of Anapanasati Sutta that is not ever quite understood is that it's built— the Anapanasati Sutta itself is built around bringing someone into the first Jhana, because it's got all the qualities of that. To gladden the mind, and to see the mind, investigate the mind, and gladden the mind, which is normally referred to as steps 9 and 10, will help you to remove the unwholesome thoughts so that you can unify the mind and then liberate the mind. The same thing is true with the feelings, is that instead of having the feelings of Dukkha, of dissatisfaction, We cultivate the feeling of Sukkha. We cultivate being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And then we practice that on until we develop the Samma Sanghappa, which means that we're changing our attitude from the attitude of a loser to the attitude of a winner, which can be said something like, "Aha, I've got this." That aha feeling is actually the Piti. It's sharp, it's focused, but it doesn't last long, but it is actually part of the Jhana to have that feeling of, "Wow, this is so great. This is great. This is wonderful." And you can talk yourself into that state anytime that you want to. So with the body relaxed, with the feeling of Piti, Sukkha, with the mind in a state of satisfaction, with the mind in a state of happy nobility, and that the mind is free from the hindrances, that's the first Jhana. And all of that is spelled out directly with both the Eightfold Noble Path and The Anapanasati Sutta, especially in line with the Anapanasati Sutta, has to do with the four foundations of mindfulness. You get the body relaxed, you get your feelings relaxed, you get your mind states relaxed, and you get your mind's objects and all your thoughts into a relaxed state. This is the first Jhana, and it is so different from the other Jhanas that I'm surprised that they didn't have a different kind of word for the first Jhana, but that's what they call it. So the whole teaching of the Buddha has to do with getting into this middle state, not into the Mahayana and not into the austerities of flagellating or tudong or any of those austerity kinds of things, like for instance modern yoga. Look how hard they work and try to stretch their bodies into strange shapes. And it's painful. It's hard to do. And then they get all egoistic about it because it's hard to do, but it's not liberating. It's painful. I'm talking about modern Hatha yoga as opposed to the other kinds of yogas. By the way, the word yoga actually just means an activity or a duty. You can see it as in fact a word that comes to our English word as yoke, where you yoke an oxen to pull a cart. And so we have these yokes that we put on to try to make ourselves better. Scott's the sportsman here. You know exactly what I'm talking about, putting on yokes. How about those sandbags that they put on their wrist and feet? Or how about those, um, uh, dragging something through the water for the swimmers to give them extra strength?

**Speaker B:** They put on a little parachute. Yeah, when they're swimming.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So they, uh, so the whole practice is to make it hard because you're going to get some benefit out of making it hard. But the Buddhist teaching is, no, we're going to make it really dead easy. We're going to take all of the extra weights off. So this is where we come to the knowledge of deliverance, because the knowledge is to see that all of that baggage is heavy. We're going to stop with all of this yoga stuff and start just being okay. That's the real teachings of the Buddha, that he actually did find a way of getting rid of Dukkha, that in fact he said both formally and now, I teach only one thing, and that is Dukkha and the end of Dukkha, or Dukkha Nirodha. He said that phrase in many, many different suttas. It's in Dhamma Nikaya, it's in the Samyutta Nikaya number 22, it's in the Majjhima Nikaya number 22. Many places he has said that he only teaches one thing. And that is getting— seeing the Dukkha and then getting out of the way. Now, one of the things that the Western Buddhists have stumbled onto is the word Arahant. Now, the word Arahant originally meant someone who is worthy, worthy of gifts, worthy of honor, worthy because they have gotten their mind cleaned out. But the Westerners have turned that from the sense of worthiness into a sense of perfection, that they never have another unwholesome thought, they never have any activities. And yet there are many suttas where the Buddha talks about conversations with Mara, with his action always, as soon as that unwholesome thought comes up, he says, aha, I see you, Mara. And that's basic practice. That's the first thing that we do is we begin to look at what the mind is doing, and when we see something unwholesome, we throw it out. That's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and also good in the end. You're not going to come to a state to where you've got no more unwholesome thoughts, because that would be too relaxed. But rather, we are relaxed, but we're still alert. We're still on a vigil. We can still see And as soon as an unwholesome thought comes up, what do we do? We change it right then and there. The Buddhist model is a change model, but it's actually quite easy to do, but it's only easy with two qualities. Actually, there's several qualities. One is that you've got to have confidence or faith or respect for the path. And number two, you've got to know the path And number 3, you've got to practice the path. But there are— look at all the side things that we can do instead, like kasina, or concentration meditations, or self-flagellation, and tudonga, and hard work. And these are the things that all the religions are dealing with. To where the actual teachings of the Buddha is easy. There's no argument to it. All you have to do is just look at what you're thinking and make a change. Look at your attitude and make a change. Look at the way that you feel and make a change. Look at what the body is all stressed out and make a change. That's all there is to it. It's a change model. So now that we've come to this state, Does anybody have anything to say? Ivan, what do you think, huh?

**Speaker B:** I'm trying to remember, because I remember I had something to say, I can't recall it. Maybe—.

**Speaker A:** Don't struggle, struggle, I'm trying to remember.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's amazing how easy it is to change the mind. People, I think people are told so often that change, you know, it takes a lot of time and a lot of time and efforts. And it's, change doesn't happen overnight. But the The energizing thing about the Dhamma is that it's immediately effective. So you don't have to wait 10 years of meditating before you get the benefit from it. You can have a benefit right now. You just got to change your mind. And it's so beautifully simple. You just— the way you— we don't suffer because of what happens. We suffer because of how we react to what happens, how we view what happens. It's all mind-made.

**Speaker A:** There's a little phrase in Pali that the monks memorize. I've kind of forgotten it, but it starts off with: 'Savakato, Arahant, Ehipassiko, Upanayiko.' All those things have to do with practicing right now and getting the benefits right now. This is what the Buddha taught. And the more you practice, the better the skill of discernment. The more you practice, the better the skill of Sati, of remembering to look. So if we forget to look, or if we don't have any discernment when we do look, then our change means very little. But if we can develop the skill of looking, If we can develop the skill of remembering to look and develop the skill of actually making the change, then that's the real path of the Buddha. There is no magic to it. It's all practice, practice, practice, practice. And every time that you are practicing, you get the benefit of that practice right then and there. As well as the residual development of developing skills so that you can do those three things better. So, Christina, what do you think? Where are you, Christina? How about you, Eddie? What do you think?

**Speaker F:** I think it's good stuff. Moment by moment, I'm here practicing. Thanks for the reminder.

**Speaker A:** Yes. How about you, Potato? I'm doing a satisfaction casino. I didn't catch that. Say it again. I'm doing a satisfaction casino. Yeah, satisfaction casino. That's right. Keep satisfaction going. So, Naveed, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** No, I thank you. It's a very good reminder of the.

**Speaker A:** Middle path, and.

**Speaker B:** I'm going to start reading a little bit more.

**Speaker A:** But no, gladdening the mind, that's what you do. You don't read more. The only book you need is the book between your ears. It's one of my favorite Buddhist jokes.

**Speaker B:** You've told me that many times.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the practice itself is so simple that we only need just a couple of suttas. Yeah, we only need just a couple of suttas. If you're going to teach the Dhamma, you need to know a few more, but we don't need to remember them all. We only remember only need to remember one or two, and that would be the Eightfold Noble Path. That one's number 117, and how to practice, number 118, practicing number 10. And that's all there is to it. With a few sutras, it's got some other stuff, but you don't really need the sutras now. You already know how to practice. Never mind start again. Clean the mind out. Have fun. Don't worry. Be happy.

**Speaker B:** There's nothing to worry about. There really isn't anything worth worrying about. We're all going to die anyways.

**Speaker A:** Not a worry in the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, Santiago, what do you think?

**Speaker G:** It's great. I remember about Devadatta. How he made the Buddha, he tried to force the Buddha to increase the austerities and make them mandatory. But then the Buddha said, no, it should be voluntary. Only those who want to do it should do it. And then Devadatta tried to kill the Buddha for it and take control of the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Right. He was an ordinary man who really wanted things to— he wanted to be the king of the mountain. He was the cousin of the Buddha, by the way. And so that kind of gave him the idea that he could take over.

**Speaker G:** And so like David Haddad's downfall was not focusing on cleaning out his mind first, right?

**Speaker A:** He was interested in taking over. He was a modern-day, um, uh, Vladimir Putin. Yeah.

**Speaker G:** And so that's like some of the problems you end up seeing with practices today is like 100th Jhana, 1000th Jhana, or like militant retreats or waiting for God to beam down some insight. The Buddha said that his teaching has no secrets.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not underground, is it?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I'm very happy with it.

**Speaker A:** So, Alex, what do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** Not a whole lot. I enjoyed this call. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, aren't these calls great? I really enjoy them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I really appreciate everyone coming here on these calls. I appreciate the Sangha and everyone practicing together and supporting each other. This makes me feel really good to see all you guys here. Keep coming back and practicing the Dharma because this stuff really works, man. This stuff, this stuff is, is life-changing, you know. It changes your whole, your whole view of life, you know. What, what was used to be hell becomes heaven because you change the way you look at it.

**Speaker A:** Yep, very nice. Heaven is kind of warm in here, but I can handle that. So Joe, what do you think? Welcome, friend. Glad to have you on board. What do you think about what we talked about today?

**Speaker C:** Pretty good. Can you hear me okay?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sorry, I was at work before when the call started. My question is, what differentiates the Jhanas that he learned, that Buddha learned from Alara Kamma and Uddaka Ramaputta The 7th and 8th jhanas, he supposedly learned those before he sat under the— There's 4.

**Speaker A:** The suttas are very specific and clear about there are 4 jhanas. Basically, your question would be, when you're in the 4th jhana, what do you do with it?

**Speaker C:** I always thought the 7th and 8th were aspects of the 4th. Well, 5, 6, 7, 8.

**Speaker A:** Why put numbers on them that don't exist?

**Speaker C:** So you're saying these states, like the realm of nothingness and the realm of neither perception or non-perception, don't exist?

**Speaker A:** Or no, number 7 and number 8 don't exist.

**Speaker C:** So why do they talk about them in the suttas? Why does Sariputta go through— talk about.

**Speaker A:** Them that way in the suttas? They don't label them as 7 and 8. That's something that Lee Brassington and a few people have done.

**Speaker C:** Well, they talk about the realm of nothingness and the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, the realm of infinite space, infinite consciousness.

**Speaker A:** Those are not hard to do. By making them very high, they make them hard to do. Right.

**Speaker C:** But what differentiates those? Because he supposedly learned those practices from Alara Kalanta. Anagami and Uddaka Ramaputta before. So I'm just curious as to like what differentiates those practices from the ones that he talked about with the same names in the suttas.

**Speaker A:** Well, obviously in and of themselves and on their own, they are not liberating. Okay, that's the number one thing to remember is that those states with without discernment. It's like being in on Times Square in New York City looking for New York. But the fourth Jhana is not that hard to do. But what it is hard to do is to be able to get into it, to see what it is, and maintain it without actually having the first Jhana. The first Jhana is all of the time and activity. I wouldn't call it work. The work is not doing the first Jhana. It's not getting into the first Jhana. Once you're into the first Jhana, we have to sustain that, which means to keep throwing the unwholesome thoughts out and keep throwing the unwholesome thoughts out. And with discernment, you begin to see that almost every thought you have is unwholesome. So you throw that out too. 2. And there you are in the second Jhana because you're a happy dude. You're just not thinking about much of anything. Okay, think of the Jhanas as actually extensions of the first Jhana once you develop it as a skill. And I understand your frame of reference is that you want to go to the bottom line. You want to take the profits out of the company before you've ever produced anything.

**Speaker C:** So are you saying the Anapanasati Sutta is only teaching the first jhana?

**Speaker A:** Only the first jhana.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that all of those other jhanas are greed on the part of the Western practitioner. So when you're satisfied, which means that you can relax, and when you get even more relaxed because you've been practicing the first jhana, you will naturally slide into those deeper relaxed states. But wanting it? Not a chance. Why? Because wanting it— greed, wanting things you don't have— that's Dukkha. We have to get out of the Dukkha first. That's why I would recommend stay with First Jhana. Then in fact, if you get good at First Jhana, you don't need anything other than that. But if you don't have First Jhana because you want Second, Third, Fourth, and your questions and all of that are about it, The answer to that is the only way to get into the first jhana is not by reading about it, but by practicing it. The only way you're going to be able to get into any of the other jhanas is by becoming skilled in the first jhana. So you're making, by even asking those questions, you're making that primary mistake that I mentioned that one of your teacher's teachers had made. That it's not about future, it's about right now. Ataliko. Right now, can you enjoy what you're doing? Right now, can you be relaxed? How relaxed is not the issue. It's the point that can you relax right now? That's the real teaching of the Buddha, that remember he practiced all of those things and didn't get the value that he was looking for out of them. So you can become skilled in the fourth Jhana and you're still an ordinary dude full of greed, ill will, Dukkha. They're not the path of the Buddha, they're just not. They're the results of the path of the Buddha. An example of that also would be Metta. I have seen people practicing Metta. In fact, they practiced Metta in the time of the Buddha. But the Buddha did not practice Metta. Metta is the result of correct practice.

**Speaker C:** Is it possible to do insight?

**Speaker A:** The result doesn't work. Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker C:** Is it possible to do insight meditation or Vipassana while you're in the Jhana, or do you have to get out of the Jhana to do that?

**Speaker A:** Or did he not— One thing to.

**Speaker E:** Think about is that the Buddha said that Anapanasati is Samatha-Vipassana. There's no difference, right?

**Speaker C:** Okay, yeah, so they come together.

**Speaker E:** It's two wings, do you get what I'm saying? So there's no need to worry about things. Samatha, stopping. Vipassana, seeing. So if you stop, you see. If you see, then you stop. It goes together.

**Speaker A:** And the Buddha never gave a meditation called— the Buddha never gave a meditation called Vipassana meditation. That's made up by these Westerners, right?

**Speaker B:** Not canon.

**Speaker C:** But are you able to see the three characteristics while you're in Jhana, basically?

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, you know, when you're in Jhana, the mind Oh, Discord just went out. Yeah, the mind is clearer than ever before because there's no hindrances. So you can really start to see things for what they really are, things as they actually are.

**Speaker A:** Somebody just posted, I don't need to do the first Jhana. Who said that?

**Speaker C:** So is the thinking mind active still? I know the thinking mind is still active in the first Jhana, but in the second Jhana, like, the thoughts are still there, or are they just residing in the background?

**Speaker B:** Undiscursive thoughts. There's still cognition and perception. Unfinished.

**Speaker A:** I would say that the thoughts are more unfinished than in the background. The whole quality of discernment in the first Jhana is stop having a stupid background. There is no such thing as a background. It's just not looking. The same thing with subconscious. The reason they call it subconscious is because you're not looking. When you're looking, there is nothing. There it is, and you're doing it, and you can see it. It's not in the background. It's right then and there. So let's say that you had it like this, that you had 9 thoughts in a row of A, and then you had 1 thought of B, and then you had another 9 thoughts of A, and then you had another thought, 1 thought of B. Many people will say that B thought is the background. No, it's not. When you're having that thought, there it is. Can you see it? There's no such thing as a background. There's no such thing as a subconscious. All there is is the situation of not looking at what we're doing. Dhammarato, go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** Uh, now, um, I I noticed Buddha in many various suttas, he praised the Jhana, but he never— I mean, sometimes he does, but very rarely he, he prays like Fourth Jhana or something. He usually seems to allude to First Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yes, he talks about it like that. Aha, I see you, Mara, would mean then that the Buddha would be in that First Jhana. The second, third, and fourth jhanas are absolutely meaningless, except that when one is in a more calm state, then we can see things in that calm state that you couldn't see when you were in a more agitated state. So you've got the ordinary mind is completely agitated. And then you've got first Jhana, which is about 90% of the agitation is gone and only 10% agitation. And that's enough for you to see. But there is more that can be done, but it's not needed for liberation. What's needed for liberation is to be able to see the stuff as it's coming up. One can be completely liberated and completely happy and never touch the state of neither perception nor non- perception, that in fact for everyone that's just a label. But if you can get still enough, you can see that that state of perception versus non-perception, like, um, I started to talk about with the oil lamp, that that oil, there's not enough there to light the fire, but there is enough oil left for you to detect that there is oil in that Uh, clay. So too, it's also possible for you to see that you have stopped making shit up called perception or nama-rupa, but there is still the tendency to make shit up. Okay, I see you guys are laughing.

**Speaker E:** Oh, just having fun listening, Dhammarato. I like it.

**Speaker A:** So that's what neither perception or non-perception is, is that you still have the tendency to make shit up, but you're not doing it. Well, you've got to get in the state of beginning to stop making shit up. Okay, now one of the qualities of the first Jhana is that, yeah, we continue to make shit up, but we know that we're doing it. And then we change that shit to something that's less shit, but it's just still a thought. It's a wholesome thought, but a wholesome thought is still a pile of shit. Why? Because as soon as you have that thought and now you've gone to another, that old thought's dead and stinky. So all thoughts are temporary, all thoughts turn to shit. Immediately, and you begin to see that. You could say, in fact, that that's the third Jhana. The third Jhana is when you begin to see that every thought that you have is just, you know, you're not having any thoughts, but it still stinks. There's the aroma that is still left. But I'll come back to this.

**Speaker E:** Joe.

**Speaker A:** You have been trained in Western Buddhism. You have been trained to try to go places that you have no chance of getting to. So let's start to practice on getting the stuff that you can do. Let's get to Mahayana.

**Speaker C:** I mean, I was actually ordained in the Thai Forest tradition originally. And it's been a progressive, like, learning of, you know, other schools. And I'm well acquainted with the system that you teach. It's just, you know, there's so many voices, like, saying, like, this is the right way to practice, that's the right way to practice. So I've dabbled in, like, so many different styles, so many different schools. So it's you know, coming back to Thai Forest again and again, you know, but I'm well acquainted with everything that you're teaching and the whole Samatha, Vipassana is one side of the same coin or two sides of the same coin.

**Speaker A:** I hear the word associated or what did the word acquainted? We're not looking for people who are acquainted. We're looking for people who are practicing. Oh yeah, practicing, practicing, changing that mind from an unwholesome state to a wholesome state. This is what the practice is all about, is the practice is change, is a change model. It's not an acquaintance with 20,000 different bad practices, and one practice within that group is it might be good is to be able to, with discernment, recognize that you can change and start to make those changes over and over and over again. It's a practice model, it's a change model, it's not an acquaintance model.

**Speaker C:** Well, for me it's just been like.

**Speaker A:** Figuring out, you know, there's nothing to figure out. There's— again, that's another mistake.. It's not figuring it out. And I've had a lot of students who keep asking questions and still wanting to know. And while they're asking those questions and trying to figure it out, they're not practicing. The only way to see the result of practice is by practicing and gaining that result. Is that not right, Scott?

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. You're so funny.

**Speaker D:** Practice is, I don't consider it even practice. I consider it playing. It's like you're just having fun. Practice, you don't have to discipline yourself. Just have fun. Practice having fun. And lighten up and, you know, change your mind. We get so wrapped up in our deep, dark Dukkha, we don't realize that we can snap out of it just like that. As long as we wake up or remember to. It doesn't have to be sitting for an hour every day. Meditation is look at what you're doing right now, immediately, and make a.

**Speaker B:** Change.

**Speaker D:** To the wholesome, and then, and then keep, keep staying. It's like walking on a— it's like walking on a tightrope.

**Speaker A:** But Scott, let, let me— actually, tightrope walking is a good example. But the example that I use— and let me fill in the gaps there a little bit, you kind of made a leap— let me say there are 3 Ps. The first P is practice. The second P is performance. And the third P is play. Now, if you're playing the piano, if you're practicing the piano, you can actually practice the scales and enjoy practicing the scales. The one thing about piano practice that I was not given when I was a student in high school was the teachers who were teaching piano did not play the piano. They practiced and formed the piano, that we need to learn to enjoy what we're doing, to play with it. And so Scott is absolutely correct, but we use the word practice to get people started. But once you practice one time saying, aha, I see you, Mara, and I don't have to deal with those kind of thoughts, I can have fun instead, that's when you make the change. You can make that change from practice to play the first hour that you practice. And now you're playing with it. You just start to play with the mind. You want— Aha! I see you!

**Speaker B:** Aha!

**Speaker A:** I'm catching you! Aha! I'm having fun here! Every unwholesome thought— I see you again! This is the practice that the Buddha taught, is watching the mind, but not taking it seriously. Because it's always changing anyway, there's nothing much to.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** It's like a cat and a mouse game. Become that cat and play with that mouse. Have fun with it. All right, so I think that we've had enough for today. We'll do some more later. Anybody got any last.

**Speaker E:** Words? Thank you, everybody.

**Speaker A:** Alex, do you have one final playful note to play?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, just thank you, everybody. Had a really good time. Enjoy everybody's company whenever we show up.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right, so Mikey, why don't you take it from here?

**Speaker H:** Yeah, thanks, friends, for being here. It's such a joy to be a part of these Dharma calls and be with Sangha. And if you're watching this on YouTube or listening on Spotify or iTunes, come join us. You can find a link in the YouTube description to join the Dharma Friends Discord. And we've been doing quite a few calls here lately. We've just been putting up the calls with Dhammarato, but we've been seeing Sangha calls here just about every day. So we welcome you to participate in those. And if you don't have anything to add, that's fine too. You can just come listen and enjoy the Dharma. So yeah, come make new friends. We'll see you guys later. Have a good one. Take it easy.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Friends.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, everyone. Bye-bye. Bye, Dhammarato. Good seeing you.

**Speaker A:** Sir.

**Speaker I:** I have a little bit question. Is that okay?

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Yeah, what's up, Chi?

**Speaker I:** Yeah, so I never heard it before. It's like, so like, good enough is also like playing, right? Like we playing is also— it's like it's about being good enough instead of putting too much expectation, take it too seriously, right? So we just— so like, I have been practicing, so I can play with what I learned, right? Like, it's like, that's why some people say it's like to play with unwholesome thought, like whack a mole, something like that. Is that true? Like, is that what play.

**Speaker B:** Is?

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, you're muted. Dhammarato.

**Speaker H:** Mikey, you're muted.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, you're.

**Speaker B:** Muted.

**Speaker D:** You gotta unmute yourself on Discord.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, there you go. Yeah, all right. Okay, Sheep. Yes, um, learn to play with that unwholesome thought. Aha, I see you, Mara. Read some of those suttas in fact where the Buddha, uh, is talking about it, that he's just, uh, bopping along when one place he's laying in bed just enjoying himself, and that thought comes up, "Why don't you get up and do something?" And his answer is, "I see you, Mara, and I'm just going to lay here and enjoy the evening." So have that skill of not taking yourself seriously at all. Begin to play with it. When I say practice, what I'm saying is practice the way that a football player would practice. Or even the way that a 4-year-old would practice, that his daddy is throwing balls at him and he's missing them. But if his daddy is yelling at him for missing the ball, he's not going to learn to play. But if that 4-year-old— daddy throws an underhanded ball and the kid misses it and then catches it, his dad is going to say, "Yay, you caught that one! Yay, you got that one!" And then he throws one and the kid gets hit in the chest, and Daddy laughs and says, oh, you missed that one, never mind, here's another one. So learn to play. It's very playful. Can I.

**Speaker I:** Use Buddha, Dharma, or like everyday life, like study, family? I think you also say that. If I think how you can apply Buddha, Dharma on anything, right?

**Speaker A:** Like, so far, because it's always right now. You always have right now to practice. You don't have to go sit in the corner or sit in some meditation hall to practice. You can practice to be playful when your mom's yelling at.

**Speaker B:** You.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I see you, Mara, inside my head. Mom yells at me and so I yell at me. No, I see that. So you can let Mom yell. I'm okay, never mind, everything is.

**Speaker F:** Wonderful.

**Speaker I:** Okay, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm using Buddha, Dharma on deciding my stuff right.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker A:** You keep playing, you keep practicing. Yeah, doing that, you'll be okay.

**Speaker I:** Okay, thank you so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you later. Okay. Okay, Mikey, you can turn it off.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a group of Sangha friends, centers on a critical distinction: **the difference between the practices the Buddha *tried and rejected* and the core, liberating path he *actually taught*.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. The Buddha's Rejected Practices (The Indirect Path)**
The talk begins by noting that many Western Buddhists, upon reading about the ascetic practices common in the Buddha's time, mistakenly adopt them because "the Buddha did it." However, the Buddha explicitly found these methods **not liberating**. They are part of the spiritual "background noise" of his era, not his teaching. These include:
*   **Kasina Meditations:** Visual concentration exercises (e.g., on earth disks, water, fire, colored discs) designed to produce stable mental images (*nimittas*) and deep concentration. While they can develop skills like photographic memory or one-pointed focus, the Buddha found they **"had nothing to do with the questions he was looking for"** and did not develop discernment.
*   **Austerities & Extreme Asceticism:** The severe self-denial the Buddha undertook before his awakening (e.g., starving himself), which he rejected as a futile extreme.
*   **High Jhanas (2nd-4th+):** The deep, formless absorption states (like "nothingness" or "neither perception nor non-perception") that the Buddha mastered but found provided no lasting answer to suffering. The speaker argues that a modern obsession with attaining these high Jhanas is a form of "spiritual materialism" and greed.

### **2. The Buddha's Actual Teaching (The Direct Path)**
The core of the talk emphasizes what the Buddha *did* teach after his awakening: a simple, direct, and practical path of **mindful change** available in the present moment.
*   **The Middle Path & First Jhana:** The Buddha discovered the "Noble Middle Path" between the extremes of sensual indulgence and severe austerity. This path is epitomized by the **First Jhana**, which is redefined not as a state of stopped thought or intense concentration, but as a **well-organized, joyful, and alert mind** free from the five hindrances (sense desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt). It is a state of active, wise investigation.
*   **It's a Change Model, Not an Acquisition Model:** The practice is not about *attaining* special states in the future, but about **changing your mind *right now***. When an unwholesome thought (a "hindrance" or "Mara") arises, you see it ("Aha, I see you, Mara!") and consciously change your attitude to a wholesome one. This is the essence of Right Effort.
*   **Key Suttas & Practices:** The direct method is encapsulated in:
    *   **The Eightfold Noble Path (MN 117):** The framework for developing right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and *samadhi* (understood as mental organization, not forced concentration).
    *   **Anapanasati (MN 118):** Mindfulness of breathing, presented not as a concentration exercise but as a complete system for developing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, leading naturally to the First Jhana and liberation.
*   **Accessible & Immediate:** The path is "dead easy" and its benefits are immediate. You don't need years of austerity or complex visualization. You need:
    1.  Confidence/faith in the path.
    2.  Knowledge of the path (from a few core suttas).
    3.  Practice of the path (the moment-to-moment "change model").
*   **From Practice to Play:** The ultimate attitude toward practice should be **playful**. Like a cat playing with a mouse, you learn to playfully catch unwholesome thoughts as they arise, not taking them—or yourself—too seriously. The goal is to "gladden the mind," relax, and be satisfied.

### **3. Common Misconceptions Addressed**
*   **Vipassana vs. Samatha:** The Buddha did not teach them as separate practices. In true practice, calm (*samatha*) and insight (*vipassana*) arise together as two wings of one bird.
*   **The Goal of an Arahant:** It is not a state of robotic perfection with no unwholesome thoughts ever arising. It is the **skillful and immediate recognition and release** of such thoughts, making one "worthy" (*arahant*).
*   **The Role of Reading:** While study has its place, "the only book you need is the book between your ears." Direct practice and observation are paramount.

### **Overall Message**
The talk is a critique of over-complicated, goal-oriented, and ascetic practices that distract from the Buddha's simple, revolutionary core: **suffering (*dukkha*) and the end of suffering.** Liberation comes from a relaxed, joyful, and vigilant mindfulness that allows you to change your mind in the present moment, not from mastering ancient concentration techniques or austere rituals. The path is direct, accessible, and should be approached with a spirit of play and satisfaction.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the difference between the Buddha's core teachings and the pre-existing or non-liberating practices common in his time.

Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Direct Pathway" vs. "Side Roads":**
    *   The core teaching (the Noble Eightfold Path) is described as the **"direct pathway"** or **"direct method."**
    *   Other practices (like kasina meditations or intense jhanas) are implied to be indirect detours or side roads that don't lead to the final goal of liberation.

2.  **Spiritual Materialism & Competition:**
    *   Practices like intense austerities or advanced jhanas are compared to a form of **"spiritual competition"** or **"spiritual materialism,"** where people seek achievements and states to acquire, rather than focusing on letting go.

3.  **The Yoke:**
    *   The word "yoga" is linked to the English word **"yoke,"** as in yoking an ox to a cart. The metaphor suggests that many spiritual practices add a burden or extra weight (of striving, rules, difficulty).
    *   In contrast, the Buddha's path is described as **taking the weights off**, making it "dead easy."

4.  **The Change Model:**
    *   The Buddha's teaching is repeatedly framed as a **"change model."** It's not about acquiring complex knowledge or states, but about the simple, immediate act of changing one's mind from an unwholesome to a wholesome state.

5.  **Driving Under the Influence (of Jhana):**
    *   A humorous metaphor is used: a joke about a **"DWJ" (Driving While in Jhana)**. This contrasts the unusable, withdrawn states of deep concentration with the first jhana, which is described as making someone an **excellent driver**—fully aware and present in the moment.

6.  **Whack-a-Mole / Cat and Mouse:**
    *   The practice of watching the mind is compared to the arcade game **"Whack-a-Mole"** or a **"cat and mouse game."** The idea is to playfully catch unwholesome thoughts ("Aha, I see you, Mara!") and let them go, rather than engaging with them seriously.

7.  **Practice, Performance, Play (The 3 P's):**
    *   A framework is offered: **Practice → Performance → Play**. The ideal is to reach a state of **"play"** with the Dharma, where working with the mind becomes joyful and light, not a grim discipline.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha's Asceticism & Near-Death:**
    *   The story is told of the Buddha (as a bodhisattva) practicing extreme austerities, starving himself until he was like a **"stick figure."** He became so weak he couldn't climb out of a creek and had to pull himself out with branches. This moment of crisis led him to realize these practices were not the path.

2.  **The Buddha's Memory Under the Rose-Apple Tree:**
    *   After his near-death experience, he remembered a spontaneous, joyful state of concentration (**the first jhana**) he experienced naturally as a youth while sitting under a **rose-apple tree**. This memory pointed him toward the "middle way" between austerity and indulgence.

3.  **The Cowherd Maiden & His Companions Leaving:**
    *   The story is recounted of him accepting **rice milk** from a cowherd maiden to regain strength. His five ascetic companions, seeing him break his fast, believed he had **"given up"** and abandoned him. This left him alone to discover the true path.

4.  **Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha*:**
    *   The novel *Siddhartha* is referenced to describe the **water kasina** practice. The character Siddhartha, as a ferryman, learns by **gazing at the river**, illustrating this form of concentration.

5.  **The Kasina Retreat in Georgia:**
    *   A modern anecdote is shared about a **10-day kasina retreat** where practitioners spent their time **arguing about the correct method** instead of actually practicing. This is used to critique a modern, intellectual, and dogmatic approach to Buddhism.

6.  **Devadatta's Schism:**
    *   The story of **Devadatta**, the Buddha's cousin, is mentioned. Devadatta tried to make austere practices (like living only in the forest) mandatory for monks. When the Buddha refused, saying they should be voluntary, Devadatta tried to **split the Sangha and even kill the Buddha**. This story warns against rigid, extremist views and the desire for control.

7.  **Shopliifting & Getting Away With It:**
    *   A relatable, modern story is used to debunk simplistic moral worldviews. The speaker points out that **people often shoplift or lie and "get away with it,"** contrary to the simplistic view that "crime doesn't pay." This sets up the Buddha's more nuanced teaching on kamma as observation, not a cosmic rulebook.

8.  **The 4-Year-Old Playing Catch:**
    *   At the end, a story of a **father playing catch with a 4-year-old** is used. A good father **celebrates the catches and laughs off the misses**, creating a playful learning environment. This contrasts with a harsh, results-oriented teacher and perfectly encapsulates the talk's final message: **approach the practice with playfulness, not grim seriousness.**

**In summary,** the speaker uses these metaphors and stories to draw a clear line: the Buddha distilled a simple, direct, and playful "change model" from the complex and often strenuous spiritual practices of his time. The talk argues that the essence of the path is not in achieving special states, but in the immediate, joyful work of recognizing and releasing unwholesome states of mind.
