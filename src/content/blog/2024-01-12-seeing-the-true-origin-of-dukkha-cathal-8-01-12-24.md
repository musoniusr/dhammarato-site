### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, I turned the video quarter on because this is useful. We can talk a few minutes.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, I just disappeared and then I was like, oh, right.

**Speaker A:** Now let's put it this way, while.

**Speaker B:** You'Re actually— you know, I can't see you. Let me—.

**Speaker A:** All right, now you can. No.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, so let's start it this way. While you're actually— yes, I can hear you. While you're actually practicing, then having thoughts about immigrations and visas would be considered unwholesome thought. While you're practicing Budo, having Budo. Budo is a wholesome thought. Bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath. That's Anapanasati, 100% in the right word. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Any word that has some association with like a wholesome feeling or thought or whatever, right?

**Speaker A:** May all on the in-breath, people be happy on the out-breath would be wholesome in the right context. Wanting to be happy is not wholesome. Wanting to get something done is not wholesome, but being satisfied with bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath is very wholesome. All of this is in the context of changing the mind from whatever it just scatters around your whole life. You've been thinking about 100,000 different things and to not feeling happy. If you can sit down and do Bu on the in-breath and Do on the out-breath and keep that going, you're in bliss, you're in heaven. That's the only thing you got going.

**Speaker B:** But yes, I can get very, very calm, but it's always— is it the kleshas that always at one particular moment pull you out of that?

**Speaker A:** That's the unwholesome thought. You can call it a klesha, you can call it an asava. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Same as kleshas?

**Speaker A:** Well, they are almost interchangeable, but the words themselves have particular poly meanings. The word kilesa is like a bondage, like handcuffs. Yeah, for the mind. Okay, or maybe a ball and chain that you carry around. That's a kilesa— being chained up, being imprisoned. There are 10 kilesa. The first one is ignorance about who you are. The second one is ignorance about the world in the sense of all the rights, rules, rituals, all all of those kinds of things, "Oh, you should do Budo." That's a klesha, and you can tell that it's a klesha because it starts with the word "should" or "ought," setting up a set of rules about how things are supposed to be. And when you're trying to, let us say, conform to the right way of doing things, that's not because you're trying to conform rather than just forget about all the conforming and just enjoy Buddha. Yeah, wow, this is nice. Okay, that's another one that would be a really good mantra for many people. Wow on the in-breath. Wow. Or this is nice would be on the in-breath.

**Speaker B:** Wow. All right.

**Speaker A:** And these would be called a mantra, but a mantra has to mean something that takes you into a good state. And a mantra would be— I want.

**Speaker B:** To go into a good state. That's the question. Do I want to go into a good state?

**Speaker A:** The answer is the only other kind of state would be a bad state. Do you want to go into a bad state. If perhaps instead of bad, you could say unwholesome or ordinary. So yes, of course you want to not only go into a good state but keep the mind in a good state. Okay, calm.

**Speaker B:** Calm. If I say calm, you know, like nothing's happening, nothing's coming up, It's not really good or bad, it's just very like raw. I wouldn't call that a good state, it's just like very— things are not triggering anything inside of me, it's just so calm.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that good? Isn't that good? Okay, all right.

**Speaker B:** I say good, I think of like Piti and— I know, that's the whole.

**Speaker A:** Point, is that language is difficult to convey the Dharma because everybody has an individual unique definition of every word they use. So when they hear the word good, they've got a particular context of what that means. And of course, being a good state would be— I mean, you go to the store, wouldn't you rather go to the store, go grocery shopping in a good state? Or how about going to the grocery store in a bad state and then see all the prices is too much, and you're worried about the government and all kinds of stuff like that, rather than just going and getting what you mean. Oh, this looks nice, we'll put that in the basket.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what is the balance then of.

**Speaker A:** Having.

**Speaker B:** These— you could say, like, I want to say endless but constant—.

**Speaker A:** How about— how about unremitting? Use the word unremitting. It keeps coming back and coming back.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** What.

**Speaker B:** Balance do you have of doing that so much rather than just staying at that point of contact where you're not actually doing that constant wholesome— well, to— Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

**Speaker A:** Let's look at the difference between process and results. And right now what we're talking about, process, and you just immediately now switch to result. Let's go back to process.

**Speaker B:** Process of the doing of having these wholesome thoughts over and over and over to get the mind to a particular state. Out of the unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Out of the unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Out of the unwholesome, right? So you're out of the unwholesome and there's like a particular like satisfaction point where you feel like you don't need to push it as much as you were doing it. It's already the monkey or the elephant, so to say, is like pretty tied down to that pole or that wholesome thought or object or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Actually, from the very beginning, This is what we mean by diversion. So the monkey or the elephant is in fact tied down, but the monkey or the elephant is not satisfied and keeps jerking on the rope, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes. But when that— when it sits down and say, okay, I give up, you, you beat me, you overcame your own hindrances, at that point you just be like, okay, I'm just going to chill here and experience This right now. Okay, but, but how about cool.

**Speaker A:** As opposed to raw? All right, and the reason for it is, is because cool indicates no longer hot. You could almost go so far as to say that meat is better for humans in our culture cooked, right? We don't want raw.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay.

**Speaker A:** And now not only cooked but now cooled down. For instance, have you ever killed an animal, cut it up with a knife, and eaten the raw meat?

**Speaker B:** I don't think so.

**Speaker A:** No. Well, that's what raw means.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Which is very primitive, kind of, uh, uncultured. And so how about raw emotion?

**Speaker B:** Yes, things are just kind of appearing and disappearing like that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so let's not use the word raw as a place to go to. Let's use that the mind is no longer jerking you around, because in fact a lot of the rawness has to do with fear. Well, what about this? What about the visa? What about this? What about that? Oh no, what's this? Okay, so this is based in fear. And what we're looking for is to become content and satisfied, which means safe.

**Speaker B:** Okay, let me give you just an idea or a thought that I picked up from somewhere. But is it a good idea, for example, dealing with fear that's in the heart, to go into somewhere that's like very triggering for that fear to literally go to a place. Like why some of these monks go to caves or near dangerous wildlife and dealing with them, the endless, I guess, fear in the heart of doing something in that case. Because it seems like the kilesas are like very latent.

**Speaker A:** In certain cases, okay, that's not a yes or no question. It has to do with certain cases, all right? So if you can go in fear and trepidation into the graveyard at sunset and spend the night there, then in the morning you can come out of that saying there was no reason to be afraid. It was actually not dangerous. All right, going into a cave and spending the night in the cave and getting bitten by a poisonous snake, and you crawl out of that cave almost ready to die— that's not going to help you become fearless.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, like, all.

**Speaker A:** Right, not doing it, right?

**Speaker B:** Exposing yourself a bit.

**Speaker A:** Dealing with dangerous situations, you have to be prepared for so that you can conquer that situation, become successful, and then the fear will dissipate. But going into situations that are dangerous and getting clobbered is not going to help you become fearless.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, or maybe you could say, going so far in a more advanced state, going into a dangerous situation situation getting clobbered but surviving. And now you can get more fearless. Now, I'd rather use the word safe and secure as opposed to fearless.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** You have to develop this issue of being safe and secure. So sitting on the sidewalk in meditation in a busy city is not safe, it's not secure. But going off someplace where there's nobody around— so it's possible that the cave is being seen as a safe place because there's nobody around, that in fact going to a cemetery could be a very safe place because there's nobody around except for the ghost in your mind.

**Speaker B:** And that's the ghost that comes up. That's like latent. And in each case or each different scenario, there's this latent fear.

**Speaker A:** Right. Which you could call seeds. You could call those seeds, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. This is back to the word kilesa and that the kilesa would be like the seeds of discontent. And then the hindrance would be when those seeds come up in the form of thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah. Which, so like, just in the simple case of staying with the breath, that pulling you away from, or making those.

**Speaker A:** Seeds, you're not growing those seeds, you're not thinking about the dangers of snakes in a cave, and you're not thinking about the dangers of ghosts in a cemetery.

**Speaker B:** But when they pop in, those are the kilesas in a way.

**Speaker A:** Then they're full-blown hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, so really, like, it seems like you have to have this kind of Sati. I guess you call it like you would say unremitting Sati.

**Speaker A:** Remembering to not go into mental dangerous places. Like for instance, when you're very peaceful and happy and calm, cool— you use the word raw— when you're sitting in the— at the Y, and then thoughts of, oh, I've got to go do the visa, that pulled you out of that calm state that you got into when you were thinking Budo, Budo, Budo. If you have Budo Budo, Budo, everything is cool. But if you have Budo, Budo, Visa, Budo, immigration, Budo, that keeps you busy in the mind. So can you come out of that and into just Budo? Oh wow, this is nice. Or everything is okay. There's a lot of different ways. In fact, Om Namah Shivaya can be a good state. What is that? Om, you know the word Om, and then Nama, in the name of Shiva. Shivaya, Om in the name of Shiva, is a Hindu Mantra. And people who are practicing that can get themselves into a calm state because they're doing Om Namah Shivaya, Om Namah Shivaya, instead of Om Namah Visa, om, visa, om, immigration.

**Speaker B:** There is this— how about if calmness has this lingering boredom to it, even though it's calm?

**Speaker A:** Right, but that's in fact not calm. Boredom in fact is a better way of using the language of Buddhism would be That's restlessness. Boredom means that you're not rested, that you're wanting this moment to be different than it is. We're bored with this moment. It's not good enough yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, and so you can double— oh, wait a minute. This is Buddha. This is not restless. This is not boredom. But restlessness and boredom as a hindrance comes from actually the klesha of restlessness and boredom, that we're never trained to be satisfied. In fact, you could say that restlessness is an instinct. That anything could come up, anything could happen. You could be chased, being chased by a rhinoceros, and so you got to run. Okay, so in fact, running away or chasing anything in the mind would be that kilesa. It comes out of our DNA.

**Speaker B:** The thing, it's like when you're in a when you're practicing like 9, 10 hours a day, that's the thing is like there's parts of the day where it's like, wow, like it's tranquil, it's pretty cool. And this boredom, this under like invisible boredom just pops out more, pulls you somewhere.

**Speaker A:** Right, and when you see that, you can say something. In fact, I remember that very, very well at Wat Soen Mokkh that that boredom would come And I was thinking about leaving. But thinking about leaving, those are restless kind of thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And it eventually dawned on me after a couple of weeks or more that, oh, I'm not practicing correctly. And so what you're saying is that you're doing that in a day, in part of the day, you can be in that calm state and then you can still be practicing. But now you're restless, now you're bored, now you want something new.

**Speaker B:** It's not that I want, it just comes up and it's sticky even though I don't follow the train of it, it's just kind of there, it's like with my experience but I'm not going—.

**Speaker A:** Okay, where is this boredom in the body? What part of the body does this boredom come up in?

**Speaker B:** I would say actually like I would say like between the skull and the throat feeling.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's high as opposed to low. Yeah, but in any case, you can actually breathe into it. As you breathe in, then the sinuses that in fact of the size of a normal head, which is smaller than— or about the size of a soccer ball, smaller than a soccer ball. And the sinuses inside of the head, behind the eyes, in the temple, around the nostrils, down in this area of the body, is called the sinus cavity, and it's the size of an apple. All right, so start paying attention to that, because in fact, if that's where you're experiencing the mortem, then breathe into it and clean it out. Use that as your example, or if it's in the throat, then imagine that the air is coming— not just imagine, but actually experience in the sense of sensation or feeling— the air coming into the throat and nourishing. That a part of the restlessness is kind of a mental concept of not getting nourished, that you need something, you need to run away, you need to go chase something. And so when that boredom comes up, come back and change your point of reference into, oh, I've got everything I need. Oh, there's no place to go and nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** So when you said change your reference, you're saying, well, just remember, I was using Jesus So put those same thing, but you mean change the reference from that mental repetition into another wholesome thought, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually take it from the nose tip and expand it all the way into the cavity. Yeah. And then all the way into the cavity and all the way into the cavity. That in fact, the word nose tip is a bad translation of the word cavity, or of the word cave. It's not the tip of the nose here, it's the breathing mechanism that's empty except for air itself. There's no bone, no muscle, but oftentimes there is, let us say, sinus residue, snot, boogers, phlegm. All of those kind of words will fill up that cavity. And now mentally you can say that that instead of phlegm, it's boredom, restlessness, stopped up. You need for it to flow. All right, so change. So one of the things you can do then is to clean out your sinuses. Get breathing going really good, and then experience how satisfied and how nurturing breathing really is, right down to the throat. Now there's something else. This may be going a bit too far, but behind the eye level, back where the throat is, you know that in the throat it comes in through the mouth And then it makes a change and goes down into the body. But we start nose area, and then it makes a change. There's a curve. This is what we call the throat, right? Behind that is the brain. And the particular part of the brain that's there at the back of the throat is called the amygdala. And the amygdala is the source of danger, right? That's the part of the brain that experiences danger. So you're spot on when you talk about that. You can feel it in the throat, your restlessness. So what you want to do is, while you're breathing, imagining and actually experiencing then the air itself is a calming, soothing, nurturing thing for that part of the brain, the amygdala, which is behind and below the sinuses. And so you can just— oh, it feels so good— and come back to that with maybe thoughts of, well, really there's no place to go, really there's nothing to do. Right here, right now is really good enough, because restlessness and worry are coming from the seed of things are dangerous, things need to be done. Why am I wasting my time here at the Wat when I could go off making $100 an hour doing computer code? That thought, or those kind of thoughts. Like, why don't I go back and make friends with my dad? Or any of that kind of stuff, anything that takes you out of the what, that has those worried, restless, boring kind of thoughts. You can say, I see that. Never mind. Let me come back and nourish the body. Let me come back and nourish the mind.

**Speaker B:** One, okay, one question about what you just said in the last part. Is it because you haven't had like a truly, like the heart really doesn't truly understand that it just keeps bringing up stuff? You know?

**Speaker A:** Out of the DNA and it will continue to come up for the rest of your life. Yeah, right. The question will be, when that stuff comes up, how do you have the skills to handle it wisely? Okay, part of the DNA is part of being alive. It says, uh, let us say, instinctually inbred as, as it, as breathing is. You cannot survive without breathing. In the old, old days when we were jungle bunnies, we had to be restless, on our toes, so to speak, ready to jump away from that snake at any second. When we're drinking water out of the pool, there could be a crocodile 2 inches from our nose. And so it's dangerous to go drink out of the That in fact, there's a story in the Bible about how a group of army people finally, after a long journey, got to the river. And many of them put their faces right into the— right into the river water, while others would take their hands, scoop it, and drink out of the palm of their hand and then get more water and scoop and out of their palm of the hand. And the general decided right then and there that the ones who would scoop the water out of their hand would be in his army, and those who went right after the water and put their face right into the river were acting dangerously because they wanted the water so badly. Not knowing that that was a dangerous thing to do, because it's better to have a crocodile grab your arm than it is to grab your face. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So from that perspective, then, let's start dealing with that restlessness, which is that need to go get that water, and mollify it or adapt it so that you can do it gingerly. And this is one of the ways. Okay, so what are you going to say to yourself when that feeling of restlessness or boredom comes up? Can you have thoughts like, oh, I should go do something? Are you going to have thoughts like, oh, I see that boredom come again?

**Speaker B:** I don't have— like, I notice the boredom and the actual visceral feeling, that strong feeling in the body, but it's still there. Okay, you know, like it will just be there.

**Speaker A:** And I just say, are you going to deal? Yes, I got that right. Are you going to be okay with it? That's the whole point.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, let us say that you can't deal with it very well and you go back to Ireland, you take a job And now you're doing whatever you are doing at that job, and that feeling comes back again, and you don't have the skill to deal with it. Yeah, that in fact, here, by getting away from all of the activities of life, you begin to see that boredom there and recognize that it's always been there and it always will be. You want to be Anicca.

**Speaker B:** I can see how literally my whole life was like not me, just feeling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're driven by that. It's a driver.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And I guess the question is, at some point in practice, when you're really good at dealing with that feeling, What's it like? Just curious, like, what is it like to just wake up and not really care or have a feeling of I.

**Speaker A:** Need to do something? How about wake up and see it? That's what you're doing now. You're waking up and seeing that restlessness, that boredom. But you still don't like it. Now you can wake up and see it and not hate it anymore, not dislike it. You can say, oh, there it is again, never mind. Stop hating it. See, you come to me and you talk to me about restlessness and boredom as if you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** It's just a very strong feeling.

**Speaker A:** It's hard enough to say strong feeling and you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** It's hard to say I don't like it. I just talk about it like it's, it's so strong. Okay, like in this particular setting when.

**Speaker A:** You have literally nothing, the strength that you don't like, you're not coming around to actually admitting that you don't like it. You're using words like strong as if you're trying to convince me without convincing yourself that you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, let me find the truth in this, Sola. Make sure I can say truthfully I actually don't mind it or I dislike it. It's just when I'm practicing like here in this particular wat, And since you have no phone, you have literally nothing, right? And this is just a life. There's nothing, there's nothing, there's no— there's not like a magazine or a book even.

**Speaker A:** All right, can you, can you come to the point? And can you come to the point of seeing that that's delightful?

**Speaker B:** Not yet, no.

**Speaker A:** See, that's the whole point. You get bored and you don't like it, rather than inviting that boredom. Isn't boredom marvelous? We really do not have anything to do, there is no place to go, there is nothing dangerous here at all. Can you finally become restful?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Okay, I would say I dislike it because I get defeated by it many times. I'll get defeated by it throughout the day. Like, some— I'll just restart.

**Speaker A:** Are you using the word defeated?

**Speaker B:** Yes, defeated.

**Speaker A:** So you, you approach the boredom as a victim rather than as a lion?

**Speaker B:** I approach it as a lion, but that lion is also another lion, and we battle it out every day here, and we fight every day. We wake up, I say, wake up, Arya, let's do this again, let's try again. 'Never mind, start again.' I'll do that over and over every day.

**Speaker A:** All right. Can you take the struggle out of it? Because you're struggling with something. You're struggling with this boredom. You're struggling with this innate restlessness. It's hard to describe, but it comes from the position or the feeling are the indication that something's not right. And the fact is that everything is right, but that feeling that things are not right has come from our past. We were trained to be in the position that things are not right, they're not good enough. And it's an instinct. For hundreds of thousands of years, animals have had to deal with the jungle. It's dangerous. And the reality is, is that the what is not dangerous, but wanting something is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yes, the one thing is insanely habitual. I just wonder, especially when I see the monks, you know, I wonder how many or how long It takes someone to have that skill of— About a.

**Speaker A:** Second, maybe a tenth of a second.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, let's— I'll say the skill.

**Speaker A:** Develops when the skill is developed.

**Speaker B:** 10 years, 20 years?

**Speaker A:** No, you have it in the wrong context.

**Speaker B:** You're— I know, I know what you're saying, I know what you're saying, but I mean to be able to snap, to be able to— Yeah, I bet.

**Speaker A:** You have people in your family of advanced age that never do it. You're looking at it in the sense of how long did the monks take? Actually, once they develop the skills, it doesn't take long. So we need to practice developing the skill Rather than wanting the feeling to go away, you need to develop the technique of dealing with boredom happily.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that skill to be actually completely, truly okay with whatever arises, so to say.

**Speaker A:** Whatever occurs, like boredom occurs.

**Speaker B:** It's more like you're okay. I can feel okay, it's just a feeling. I can feel okay that it's coming up. I know it's there, it's going to be there. But it's the feeling, the feeling itself is pretty brutal when—.

**Speaker A:** That means you don't like it. You use the word brutal again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** You don't like it. It's not brutal. It's just you don't have the skills to deal with it. And one of the skills to develop is that it's okay, that it's not brutal. It's just there. You're using the word brutal as an adjective, and what you're actually describing is not it itself. It's your response to it. Um, like a guy comes home and he comes home to his wife and says, I had a day. Well, yeah, you spent the day, big deal. But if he comes home and says, I had a bad day, now he's talking about how he feels, not about the day.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So I can say— When you use.

**Speaker A:** The word brutal, you're talking about how you feel, not about the experience. The boredom is whether you liked it or not.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so beware of how you feel and how it affects your language. And one of the ways of doing that is stop using adjectives. Because your adjectives describe it, and it does it subconsciously. We don't even know that our adjectives are describing how we feel. So when you say, "It's brutal," So you're talking about how you feel about it, you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, because I couldn't say before fully, I could never say before, even in a retreat setting, like even at Deep Bhavana or any other retreat, Goenka retreat, that it's full-on boredom as it is here, because there's really no point in my mind where I have to stop this.

**Speaker A:** I could just live here. Well, the Goenka retreat, people don't deal— a lot of people do deal with boredom, but one of the things that they don't deal with is because they have bells, they have a schedule.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so now they— and so they put in, instead of concentrating or focusing on there is nothing they focus on, I don't like the schedule. The schedule is brutal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like the— okay, I don't know what word to use now. The seeds, the kleshas, the unwholesome thoughts, whatever word, they generally, they come up with something, anything, and then if I can be okay long enough with the boredom, enough that those thoughts don't seem to get their grasp on me and I can kind of overcome them. I can do that, but periodically, not like all day. It's like part of the day. It's almost like the skill of Sati. It just hasn't gotten to that point of being able to unremittingly get through it all day long. Because it seems when those unwholesome thoughts pull me away or pull me in aversion to the boredom, distraction to the boredom, it's so habitual. It's like I literally don't realize it until like 30 seconds or a minute or Even 2 minutes, 3 minutes later.

**Speaker A:** I'm like— Precisely so. So this is what you have to begin to understand, is that you have not yet learned to control your feelings. And so when these things happen, you naturally, because of old habits and because of DNA and instincts, you come up with not liking it, but you're not aware of it. Of it. And so then you'll use words like brutal to describe it and not even recognize that when you say the word brutal, you're talking about, I don't like it, that's why I give it that adjective. So begin to wake up to how you feel, okay?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you're using the word boredom, and you're using the word boredom is brutal, where in fact Nothing is going on, and you don't like that because you want something to be going on. It's really hard for people to understand that restlessness is the word used in the suttas, and what they're talking about is boredom. Okay. So let us say that you have— I'm trying to find a good analogy— you have a blob, let us say Jello, not in a bowl, just sitting on the counter. And the counter, the table, the house is not moving and jiggling, but the Jello is wiggling and moving. Why? Because it's picking up the very, very subtle vibrations. The table's not really moving that much, but the Jello is. All right, so here you are in the wat and the counter, and nothing much is happening, and yet the mind is still wiggling. And but now you can see it, you can see the wiggling, and you don't like it. That in fact not liking it keeps the jiggling going. And when you start saying, "It's okay that I'm bored, that's all right, I see, in fact I'm happy, I'm glad that I can see the boredom, that's why I'm actually in the Wat, is to give myself a peaceful environment so I can see how unpeaceful the mind is. But when we are stuck in it, we don't like that jiggling, and we call it boredom. And the Buddha calls the word restless, and I'm using the word jiggling, vibrating. Okay, why do people go to discos and balls and dance? Why do people dance? Why? I mean, the floor, the dance floor, is not moving, it's not jiggling, but the body is. Why? Because we've got all this restless energy inside. And so people go ignorantly to the ballroom or to the disco and dance it. And here you are in the wat and you're seeing that jiggling inside. And under normal circumstances, you might go to the disco. Okay, now you've got no place to go, but you're still seeing that jiggling and you're calling it brutal. Because you don't like it, instead of saying, "Aha, I see that jiggling inside, I see that jiggling mind," and be happy that it's there, that it's part of being alive.

**Speaker B:** In the moments of practice in the day, when if I can stick it enough, something that the boredom seems to kind of fall away, so to say, or the mind gets concentrated or one-pointed or something like that, and the tranquility comes in. Now, up until that moment, the practice is pretty solid and pretty correct, but there's always this point where even though things have become prank, there's always this point where like, it's like the sense of something's looming. Like there's the looming, the looming, it's like, you know, that the sun is gonna come back up again and the sun is the boredom. Like, you know, like you've gotten everything cool, it's nighttime now, you're chilling, but you know the sun is gonna come up again. Like, you know it. Is it— is it— do you not.

**Speaker A:** Like the Sun coming back up? Here's the question though. The Sun's going to come back up, but you're sounding like you don't like the fact that the Sun's going to be coming back up.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So the practice was that got me to that point was being okay with that happening. That got me to that cool state. But I guess, I mean, my question was, is that like I mean, in your practice or whatever, I knew like, is it that you got so skillful at doing that, that it's almost like you could just stay in nighttime all the time? Like, it seemed like you could just chill out at nighttime all the time.

**Speaker A:** No, being able to chill out even though there's daytime, because there is those cycles. That's why I say sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. In fact, in a way, you've got things backwards in the sense that daylight, when the sun comes up, you can see all around you and you can see that it's safe. But when the sun goes down, it gets dangerous. And look what people do in every society. Because we do, as human beings, we don't like the dark. We would have oil, we would have candles, we would have safe housing, we would have now modern electricity and bright lights because we don't like the dark because we can't see and therefore things are more dangerous. This is exactly what happens with ghosts in the cemetery at night. Is okay, but feel danger.

**Speaker B:** Yes, but I just, I guess if you can't see anything, right, let's say just in that analogy, like it's nighttime and it's just mainly tranquility, everything just seems nothing is coming up anymore, like that, that background sense of something, that background boredom is gone, and you're at that that— not raw, what was the word that you used— that just experiencing life.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it doesn't matter which side of the analogy that you want to go with. I'm not fighting with you over whether you dislike or like bright or dark.

**Speaker B:** No, no, I just— I'm talking about.

**Speaker A:** The fact that when things change to the other, we don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's why people go in the daytime, they make candles or they go buy candles because they don't like the dark. But then you can say that they also go and get oil to oil the skin or put sunscreen on, or maybe we wear clothing because we don't like the hot sun's rays on the skin. The point is, is that we act and do things ignorantly because we don't like them. And it's good for you to become aware of whether you like and don't like things. And this, the topic that we're talking about, is boredom, and you don't like it. So go find the good. Look on the bright side of boredom. Look on the bright side of life. What's the bright side of boredom? Tell me, I'm listening. Come on, tell me what's the bright side of boredom. What's the better part of boredom?

**Speaker B:** The better part of boredom? Satisfaction, I guess, when it— All right.

**Speaker A:** I'll buy that. That in fact boredom is being dissatisfied, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** I would say that the coolness, the coolness when you're really fine with just sitting or— But it is okay.

**Speaker A:** But coolness and just sitting is not boredom. Boredom is when you are just sitting and cool out and then all of a sudden you don't like it. You want something to change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the good part of the boredom is that, wow, it only comes up when there is nothing happening. And so you can be really happy. Oh, I'm so glad that I'm bored because that really means that I've got no place to go and nothing to do. Let me go back into enjoying no place to go and nothing to do. Because boredom means I want something to do. I want— it's desire.

**Speaker B:** What? Okay, what's— what would you say is, is playing? You know, like playing, like to be playful. In what regards is that— is that coming from desire or not? You know, I don't know if that's—.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what I'm inviting you to do. Look on the bright side of boredom. Look on the good side of boredom. Is actually being able to play with boredom, rather than calling it brutal because you don't like it. Become playful with it. Take a deep breath, clean out the sinuses, let that air flow down the throat. Say, "Aha, I am not in a state of hatred for boredom." Because boredom is in fact a state of not liking. Let me give you this example. The kids are in the back seat of the car on a long car journey, and the kids will say, "I'm bored." And Mom's sitting in the passenger seat. What does she do when the kids say, I'm bored. She plays a game with them. She gives them an activity. She takes their mind away from the fact that they've got nothing to do, because the inside of the back seat of the car is boring. But look out the window. Count how many red cars you can see. Start paying attention to what's going on around you.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, let me, let me just quickly throw this in. This— I can't tell, you know, I can't tell if, if sometimes I have these thoughts or feelings about like unclosed doors of the past, especially in regards to my family. Um, yeah, I would say, I say like 90% of it's family. 10% immigration visa, but 90% family. Now, I don't know if it— like, there's some part of me that doesn't fully— like, it just seems like there's something still to do there. And so that stuff comes up. And I know in the moment when I met it, what I'm— don't you.

**Speaker A:** Remember that I just said that not long ago in our conversation here when I was mentioning the point of Oh, I should go back and straighten things out with my dad. All right. Those are the kind of thoughts that we're talking about. Yes, those things come up and you can call that restless or boredom and you can call it brutal.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But I guess what you can do instead is play with it. Like, for instance, say, oh, Dad's okay. 'Let me be okay now too.' He's all right.

**Speaker B:** Well, there must be some balance or some kind of action at some point.

**Speaker A:** Actually, yes, yes, there is. And that is beginning to recognize and see how you feel about things. That you don't like it. You called it boredom. It's a state of you don't like it. Can you see that? Can you— that's the job, that's the right effort of investigating, so that you can see that you don't like it. Then you have a choice about— and we've been talking about what kind of choices that you can have to deal with it once you recognize that you don't like it, once you see that you don't like it. Yeah, you didn't come and say, yippee, happy award! You called it brutal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you still haven't come to the point of recognizing that you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I, I, I— you're also.

**Speaker A:** Coming to Okay, and so now you do have now the opportunity when you recognize that you don't like it, you have choices. And now you're asking me, well, what do I do? What are my choices? The answer is, is when you can see those times, those moments when you're in a state of not liking it, you know what to do to make a change. Play with it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, this is another quick kind of side thing about that. Did you ever feel like you were— this is weird maybe— but you ever feel like you're going to die in your practice? Like you're just in the present moment and like it's like you're giving up the past sort of in a way, like you're giving up the attachment that kind of is you in a way.

**Speaker A:** When it feels like you're going to— Exactly, exactly. This is what Anatta is all about. Out is that you're coming to the point of recognizing, yes, you do have to die. Your past has to die. Who you are in terms of your past needs to die. And the fear comes up. Oh, poor me.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that fear comes up regularly now.

**Speaker A:** We don't like it, and you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And because you don't like it, you call it dying.

**Speaker B:** It's like when I first said that sense of unclosed door with my family, it's like you're afraid to close that door. It's scary that I could let that go.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Not, sorry, I could let my family go, but that's the problem is like there's this battle between like I could let that feeling, this feeling go of my family feeling, but there's this unclosed door feeling that kind of comes up. It's like, you can't do that, like you haven't worked things out with your parents, you haven't worked things out with your brother, you know, like that comes.

**Speaker A:** Up and comes— Well, here's how to play with that. When those kind of thoughts come up, you can say, wow, 'Let me develop the skills that I need so that someday when I'm really skillful, I can go back and deal with that old stuff.' But right now you can't deal with it even when you're sitting in the wat. How could you possibly go and deal with it in Ireland? But you don't have the skills to deal with it when it comes up now. And so if you go back to Ireland and you want to straighten things out with your dad, he's just going to say what he always said and then you're all freaked out again because you don't have the skills to deal with him in Ireland, because you don't have the skills to deal with him here at the Wat. So tell yourself, now is not the time to deal with Dad. Let me deal with my thoughts and my feelings instead, so that I become really skillful with my thoughts and my feelings. And let that happen in the future. The future will take care of itself. That, okay, you can close that door and you can even lock it, but it'll open again sometime. That's up to you. And that— and those thoughts are part of the restlessness, is part of the boredom. That you really do have nothing to think about. And so you'll start thinking about the past. Other people, when they're sitting bored in the wat, they'll think about the future, and then they'll freak themselves out over the future, or freak themselves out over the past, which the freak out means they don't like it. So can you see your feelings of not liking? And then you can deal with them happily. But so long as you're using words like brutal, that means that you're not aware of the fact that you don't like it. You don't like thinking about your dad. You don't like thinking about what happened in Ireland before, and so now you're having the— oh, I should go straighten out the past, I should go fix it, and then I'll be happy. But if you do go try to fix it, boy, will you be unhappy for sure.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, I think it's more of like recognizing how how parents get old. I guess it's like what you said a long time ago about, like, okay, well, avoiding basically— if I can imagine, like, if my parents died or something, then I'd be like, oh no, the guilt probably would come up about— You don't like guilt.

**Speaker A:** You don't want to feel guilty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you want to go straighten things out so that you don't feel bad. And what I'm suggesting is, is learn to deal with your feelings now so that whatever happens— your dad dies and you feel guilty, but that's okay. That in fact maybe you've heard me say a time or two that I'm really glad my mom's dead. Because if she was still alive, she'd be over 100 and she would really be in bad shape and I'd feel guilty about it. But now that she's dead, I'm free. But I felt free before she died. So can you feel free about your dad? Maybe then you can deal with him, but you got to be free from those bad feelings about the past. This is one of the reasons why in the Bible Jesus says, let the dead bury the dead. Let your Past be the past. Let it be dead and buried. You can go exhume the body later when you've got the right backhoe. But going and digging up a grave to exhume with a teaspoon, not so easy task.

**Speaker B:** I could tell you, you know, it's pretty annoying to have so many questions pop up during practice.

**Speaker A:** Or what's annoying is you don't like so many questions popping up from the past. It's annoying, you said. Did you hear your word ignore? Annoying.

**Speaker B:** Okay, let me finish. I'll finish and then I'll— annoying, yeah. But I meant it's annoying to have many questions come up because of practice and then having not much time to go over it or talk to it about people because of my practice has given kind of all kinds of new questions or new, kind of something I want to further look at or think about or ask someone who's probably looked or been on that terrain a bit more than myself.

**Speaker A:** So then ultimately you'll stop hating things and not liking them. You want to get yourself into a state of liking, and that's why you have all of the— well, if I could go do that, I'll feel good. If— oh, if I go stretching out to my dad, I'll be happy and all of that. Okay, and so we're actually now focusing on the real issue. The real issue is that shit happens and you don't like it, and you're focusing on shit happens. And I'm saying no, don't focus on that shit happens, focus on the fact that you don't like it. When these thoughts come up And you don't like it. You call it boredom, call it restlessness. Then you call it brutal because you don't like it. Okay, and you're trying to find a way so that you feel comfortable and satisfied by going and doing. Going and asking questions to the monks, going back to Ireland and straightening it out with your dad, dealing with your boredom, all of that kind of stuff is just merely— the point is that you're in a state of not liking.

**Speaker B:** And so, I'm not going to use another adjective.

**Speaker A:** It's hard to not like. Okay, it's hard to start liking stuff. This is your skill development. This is your right effort. Your right effort is to stop not liking and be okay with it.

**Speaker B:** Is it unwholesome? To do something that seems like it has wholesome results for people other than yourself, but the reason you approach it— like, for example, here in the walled monastery, if I have absolutely no laptop, no phone, no anything, and I'm practicing like that, and then if, let's say, I go to do something that is wholesome, but I approach it from the point of view, because I was bored, I went to do it. Is that for me, like, unwholesome? Well, does that make sense?

**Speaker A:** You're just— yes, it does, but you're missing the point. You're missing the point in the sense of that you're bored and so you go do something wholesome. You divert yourself from the unwholesome, but you haven't actually come to the point of recognizing that you're doing something now that's wholesome to avoid your not liking being bored. It's always back to the issue of doing things because we're driven by our emotions, our feelings of liking and not liking.

**Speaker B:** I was just reading Ajahn Mun a little bit about how he approached, about his approach was kind of radical, I could say. Like, I don't know if you know much about Ajahn Mun.

**Speaker A:** I know enough. Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what we had, like.

**Speaker A:** On.

**Speaker B:** The radical, yeah, like this extremely, like, I don't know the word, like, I could describe that his character from what I've just a little bit I've read about him, that he was like really driven, pretty strong, like pretty focused on his path, you know, like he seemed to not not falter or waver very much. And from reading what he did to get to that point of, of, uh, I don't know, like you could say like coming to the true Dharma or whatever, how I've read about it anyway, um, about like having a completely pure Citta or completely pure heart, um, the amount of stuff he did and went through to get to that point.

**Speaker A:** All right, stop. Can you stop a second? You talked about a pure heart, which means then, in the reference of what we're talking about, his heart was not in a state of not liking. Yeah, when you can deal with your not liking, then your heart will be pure. And I'm trying to give you the easy way out The easy way out is to see that you don't like stuff, and then you can deal with it easily because you can see that you don't like the boredom. You can see that you don't like some of the stuff in your past, and you want to go fix it, and that keeps you restless. Then you don't like it. You're in a state of not liking.

**Speaker B:** Wow, okay. The not liking is very subtle, I realized, and in this talk it's super subtle actually.

**Speaker A:** Well, what it means is it's subconscious to you, or another way of saying it, it means that you're blind to it. Yeah, or another way is that you're ignorant of it. And when you begin to see it, you call it subtle.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's pretty much— Okay, when you.

**Speaker A:** Really can see that you are in a state of not liking, you can do something about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so when you were younger and your dad was in a state of not liking, he would yell at you, he would use words like brutal, or maybe he would be brutal, which means he put you in a state of not liking because he was in a state of not liking. But if he could recognize at all he's in a state of not liking then he would have a choice about how he would deal with you. He would stop yelling. And so it's not a matter of that it's subtle, it's a matter of that you've been blind to it for so many years. That things happen and you don't like it. So that pure heart that we're talking about is getting that resolved, which means you have to see the not liking, and then we can do something about it. What do we do? Well, the kind of language that there will be is, aha, I'm glad I see that I don't I don't like it. But really, in reality, I can see that everything—.

**Speaker B:** That'S the thing. And when I was— I was kind of surprised about the extents and the lengths that this person went through to come to that point of deliverance, I guess, in terms of path.

**Speaker A:** And it's— so don't take that route. Take the easy way out.

**Speaker B:** Is there an easy way out?

**Speaker A:** I mean, there's an easy way out, and begin to see over and over again, not boredom, but, oh, I don't like it. Okay, it's not the problem with the guilt, is you don't like feeling guilty. You don't like it. You're in a state of not liking. Now that you know that you're in a state of not liking, you can give yourself the kind of thoughts that will appease that not liking. Like, oh, everything really is okay. Yeah, let me sit here and have a pure heart, not clouded, not cluttered with not liking. That even when we're in a state of wanting something, like wanting a material object, that's really another way of expressing you don't like being without it. So liking and not liking are actually the same thing, just depending upon the perspective that we take. So if I want it, that means that I want it to relieve my desire to have it, because desire is not, I don't like it. Yeah, right. I don't want to— I don't like being without my heart's desire, rather than why don't I be in a pure heart, which means I don't have to like it, which means I don't have to dislike being without it. So liking and disliking are basically the same thing. And the real issue is we're ignorant of it. This is the cause of Dukkha. This is the Second Noble Truth. You wake up to the liking and not liking, and then you can choose what way you're going to feel. Seems like that's all there is, the way things are, huh?

**Speaker B:** It seems like that's all there is.

**Speaker A:** Like, that's all there is to it. Exactly. That's why it's called the Four Noble Truths. It's noble. To wake up to the ignorance of your not liking, and then you have a choice, and you can take the right effort to come back into that pure heart state. Really is easy.

**Speaker B:** I don't want to complain again about the defilements or whatever, but they're tricky. They're very tricky. But I think what you're saying is sinking in more and more. It's— yeah, yeah. Oh, by the way, just another side on the side of that is that where are all these, all of these words coming out of, um, all of these? Because seems like things up here in Udon Thani, up in Isan, Isan.

**Speaker A:** Uh.

**Speaker B:** You use that word Isan? Isan, I don't know what's this region of Thailand called.

**Speaker A:** Udon Thani, Laos. Right, Udon Thani and Nong Khai all the way down to, uh, Khon Kaen. That whole area is a valley that's on the other side of the river. And on the far side of the river, on the northern side, on the eastern side, is Laos, which is mountain. And then on this side of the river, it's a plain. And that area of northeast Thailand is called Isan. They have their own language, but the language is very, very close to what's called Central Thai. But there are some remarkable differences.

**Speaker B:** Well, some words in terms of like Buddhist words, I never seen much of like acharya.

**Speaker A:** For example, yes, that is actually the Pali word for the word Achan.

**Speaker B:** So what's— where does the word Achan come up?

**Speaker A:** It comes out of the word Acharya. What?

**Speaker B:** Wait, so Acharya comes from Anagami?

**Speaker A:** Okay, the common word, like the word wat Anicca is a Thai word or an Isan word for the Pali word vihā.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and they describe different kinds of Samadhi in different ways. Then even when I talked to one of the Ajhans about Jhanas and how that— how that— is it just different translations of Jhana? Apparently no. Apparently the practice they do up here results in different kinds of Samadhi that's not the Jhanas from how the Buddha described those Jhanas.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Or how the Buddha describes those Jhanas. So it's coming from somewhere.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the word Samatha actually has the meaning or the connotation of being whole. Yeah, Samatha. And Samadhi is the same word, just being pronounced differently. That we use the word Samadhi in English, but in Thai it's called Samatha. Just like the word computer in English is said computer in Thai. But just like the town Chaiya, nobody knows that in Thailand because they pronounce it as Chaiya. So Samadhi, and what it actually means is unification, wholeness. And the example would be the ridgepole of a tent, that one pole, and then the rest of the tent is spread out with wires to the ground. But you have that ridge center pole, and that's what holds the whole thing up. And when the mind is in the state of Samadhi, that means that you're not Budo, Boo, immigration, Boo, visa, Do, Daddy— that's scattered. A Samatha mind is Boo, Do, Boo, Do, Boo, Do. Yeah, so the Samatha mind is paying attention to reality and the ordinary disjarded mind is making stuff up. Okay, okay, so the Samatha mind is in reality and talks about noble, talks about real, but the disorganized mind talks about I want. I don't like, and we use words like brutal. But a Samadhi mind doesn't use words like brutal. It uses words like everything is together, everything's okay, everything is organized. And so a Samadhi mind means that the mind is peaceful, satisfied with the way that it is. Not scattered. So if we tell a lie, like using the word brutal or boredom— boredom is just boredom— but when you call it brutal, you're adding your not liking to it. You're telling a subtle little lie. Your adjectives often flavor things out of the real into the feeling realm. And so the noble mind, the Samadhi mind, doesn't want anything. So we don't tell lies. The reality is good enough. Also, the Samadhi mind doesn't have questions, it doesn't have doubts. Is it this, is it that? Should I practice this way, should I do that? What do I do about boredom? I don't like boredom, but I don't I don't know that I don't like boredom. All of that is an ordinary mind. The Samatha mind is, I got it. Now, how deep into I've got it can you go?

**Speaker B:** That was what I was curious about when I was talking to to one of the Ajhans about these different words. I can't fully remember, like Upacharya Samadhi or Anapanasati Samadhi, like.

**Speaker A:** There'S different words. Okay, Upadana has to do with the word dana or giving or having the feeling of generosity. Having a feeling of, in fact, being really wealthy. It's sort of like, imagine a bucket, an old cast iron or steel bucket, a pot, maybe a bowl, something like that, that's sitting under a water faucet that drips. Now, if you take a bucket out of the sun and put it under the water and it's dripping, for a while you won't get any water at all because the water evaporates because the bucket's hot. But after the bucket cools down a bit, now the drops of water will start to accumulate. Okay, and as the bucket begins to fill up, we have various words for that. But the ordinary bucket is hot when it's put under the dripping faucet. So what is the dripping faucet would be cool thoughts. And when the bucket gets all the way full and then starts to overflow, that would be what we have as being able to give it out, feeling wealthy, feeling full, feeling rich. Your video went away. There you go, now you're back again. All right, so That would be the Upadana. Samadhi is when the mind is overflowing with wealth, with goodness.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, I was just wondering where these words came from because I never heard.

**Speaker A:** All of the Buddha's words were ordinary language of the Pali that the people use, and he spoke the language of the people. But now that, let us say, that the teaching of the Buddha has been enshrined into the Pali language, but the Pali language is not Thai. In fact, the Thai language is much closer to Pali than English, and so we have to describe what the word means. So, overflowing with the unified mind would be Upadana, Samadhi.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And a lot of Westerners use all of these Pali words without really understanding what they're talking about. And the Thais have a whole lot of trouble putting what their understanding of it is into English.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can imagine. I can imagine the translation stuff seems a little spiffy sometimes.

**Speaker A:** So that's what I see is the duty to the Dhamma is for a good teacher to find out the kind of language that the Pali is actually, or not the language of the Pali, but rather what the actual language means, what's really there, and then being able to put that into English so that the students can understand it. For instance, talking about Buddho— Buddho is not actually that important, but what's important is when we give the student Buddho, is that can he actually use that to settle his mind, get it cool so it starts to build the wholesome. And pretty soon the wholesome is so built up that it overflows.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, wholesome thoughts. Can you keep your thoughts wholesome? And talking about boredom being brutal, it's not wholesome. You know, I said that super unconsciously. Wakey wakey, wake up! Wake up to the fact that we don't like stuff and that drives our behavior. It drives our lives and we do it all ignorantly. Can you wake up to what's happening so that you have choices rather than being driven by your not liking?

**Speaker B:** All right, I think I've understood.

**Speaker A:** So when you get into not liking something, say, aha, I see that, because aha, I see that is actually putting the mind in the state of liking that which you a moment ago didn't like. Like seeing that you don't like. Arahant, I see it. Oh, I'm confused. I don't know what he's talking about. Oh, I'm glad I see that confusion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so go give your cell phone back and sit down and start watching that you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I'll give him— I give him back in the afternoon, and then, but then it's gone maybe for another— well, I can ask for pretty much any time I want. I just I don't have really much of a use right now until I need to get the visa stuff sorted out.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Anyways, yeah, so you can sit down now and start liking the moment. Everything is okay, not a worry in the world.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay.

**Speaker A:** When I see that boredom, ah, there it is again. Yeah, I know boredom, my old friend. Hello darkness, my old friend. Hello boredom, my old friend.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, I think we're cool.

**Speaker A:** I think we're cool. Now you can start building up that wholesome now that you got hot and cool. Your Dharma doesn't evaporate in the heat of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I'll let you know what's up soon anyway. I don't know when, but soon.

**Speaker A:** That's okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you. Thank you, Dhammarato. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a Sangha friend, focuses on practical meditation advice for dealing with restlessness, boredom, and unwholesome thoughts during intensive practice. Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Practice: Anchoring in the Wholesome**
*   The primary instruction is to use a simple, wholesome mantra or word paired with the breath (like "Bu" on the in-breath, "dho" on the out-breath) to anchor the mind.
*   The goal is to replace the mind's habitual "scattering" to 100,000 things (worries about visas, family, past, future) with a single, satisfying focus. Staying with "Buddho" leads to calm and bliss.

### **Understanding Hindrances: Boredom & Restlessness**
*   A major theme is reframing **boredom** not as a neutral "calm," but as a subtle form of **restlessness and dissatisfaction** (*kilesa* or *asava*). It's the mind's instinctual feeling that "this isn't enough; I need to be doing something else."
*   These hindrances arise from latent "seeds" of discontent (fear, desire, past conditioning) and our DNA—an evolutionary instinct to always be on guard for danger or opportunity.

### **The Crucial Insight: "Not Liking"**
*   Dhammarato repeatedly guides the student to see that the core problem is not the external circumstance or the thought itself, but our **subconscious reaction of "not liking"** it.
*   We mask this with adjectives like "brutal," "annoying," or "strong," which are judgments stemming from our aversion. The path to freedom is to **wake up to this state of "not liking."**
*   Once you see clearly, "Aha, I am in a state of not liking this boredom/past thought/fear," you have a choice. You are no longer blindly driven by it.

### **Skillful Means for Dealing with Hindrances**
1.  **Change Your Reference:** Don't fight the feeling. Shift your attention:
    *   **Physically:** Locate the sensation (e.g., tension in sinuses/throat). Breathe into it, imagining the breath as a calming, nourishing force for that area (even the amygdala, the brain's fear center).
    *   **Mentally:** Use soothing, present-moment phrases: "Oh, everything is okay." "There's no place to go, nothing to do." "Hello boredom, my old friend."
2.  **Play with It:** Adopt a playful, investigative attitude instead of a battling one. See the restless "jiggling" of the mind as interesting data, not an enemy to defeat.
3.  **Postpone "Fix-It" Missions:** When thoughts about fixing past family relationships arise, see them as another form of restlessness. The advice is to develop the skill to be okay with your feelings *now*; going back to "fix" things without inner skill will likely cause more turmoil.
4.  **Cultivate a "Pure Heart":** A pure heart (*citta*) is one free from the constant push-and-pull of liking and disliking. The "easy way" is to continually recognize this liking/disliking mechanism until you can abide in contentment regardless of conditions.

### **Key Distinctions & Clarifications**
*   **Process vs. Result:** Focus on the *process* of maintaining wholesome attention, not on achieving a particular *result* or state.
*   **Samadhi:** Explained as a "unified" mind—peaceful, satisfied, and not scattered. It doesn't ask questions or deal in "shoulds"; it simply knows "I've got it."
*   **Language is Tricky:** Words like "good," "calm," and "raw" carry personal connotations. The Dhamma points to direct experience beyond the labels.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that the fundamental practice is **mindfulness of feeling**—specifically, the ever-present undercurrent of liking and disliking. By recognizing this with a gentle, "aha," we can disentangle ourselves from it and choose a wholesome, peaceful response. The path is about developing the skill to be okay with whatever arises, thereby cooling the mind and allowing wholesome states to accumulate and overflow naturally.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the teacher (Speaker A) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate Dhamma points, primarily to help the student understand the nature of the mind, hindrances, and practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**
1.  **The Monkey or Elephant Tied to a Post:** This is a classic Buddhist metaphor for the untrained mind.
    *   **Usage:** The student references it ("the monkey or the elephant... is pretty tied down"), and the teacher clarifies: the mind (monkey/elephant) is tied by the practice (the rope/post) but is not satisfied and keeps "jerking on the rope." The goal is for it to settle down.

2.  **Seeds (of Kilesa/Defilements):** A common metaphor for latent tendencies.
    *   **Usage:** The teacher explains that *kilesas* (defilements) are like **"seeds of discontent."** When these seeds sprout into active thoughts, they become full-blown hindrances (*nivarana*).

3.  **The Hot Bucket Under a Dripping Faucet:** Used to explain the accumulation of wholesome states and the concept of *upadana* (here meaning "acquisition" of goodness) and *samadhi*.
    *   **Usage:** A hot bucket under a drip initially loses water to evaporation. As it cools (the mind calms), the drops (wholesome thoughts) begin to accumulate. When the bucket is full and **overflows**, that represents a mind "overflowing with wealth, with goodness"—a state of unified, generous concentration (*upadana samadhi*).

4.  **Jello on a Counter:** Used to illustrate restlessness and boredom.
    *   **Usage:** The teacher says the table (the peaceful environment of the wat) isn't moving, but the Jello (the mind) is "wiggling and moving" from subtle internal vibrations. This "jiggling" is the restlessness we call boredom.

5.  **The Ridgepole of a Tent:** Explains *samadhi* (unification, concentration).
    *   **Usage:** *Samadhi* is like the **central ridgepole** that holds up the entire tent. It represents a single, unified focus (like "Buddho") that structures and supports the mind, as opposed to a scattered mind pulled in many directions.

6.  **Digging Up a Grave with a Teaspoon vs. a Backhoe:** A story-metaphor about skillfully dealing with the past.
    *   **Usage:** To address the student's urge to "fix" past family issues, the teacher advises developing skills first. Trying to fix deep-seated issues now is like **exhuming a grave with a teaspoon**—painfully ineffective. Wait until you have the right tools (**a backhoe**), i.e., a skillful, peaceful mind.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **The Biblical Army at the River:** A story about discernment and danger.
    *   **Usage:** The teacher recounts a story where a general chooses soldiers based on how they drink from a potentially dangerous river. Those who scoop water into their hands are chosen over those who put their face directly in the water. The moral: the latter act **"wanting the water so badly"** is dangerously impulsive, akin to the mind desperately grasping for something to do to escape boredom. Wise practice is more gingerly and aware.

2.  **Kids "Bored" in the Back Seat of a Car:** A domestic analogy for dealing with boredom.
    *   **Usage:** When kids say they're bored, a parent might give them a game like counting red cars. Similarly, when boredom arises in meditation, you can **"play with it"**—change your reference point, investigate the feeling in the body, or find a "wholesome game" to engage the mind skillfully instead of fighting the feeling.

3.  **Daytime and Nighttime (Cycles of the Mind):** An extended analogy for the changing states in practice.
    *   **Usage:** The student describes a cycle: achieving cool tranquility (nighttime) but dreading the return of boredom/restlessness (daytime). The teacher uses this to make a broader point: **we dislike change**. Whether it's dark (scary) or bright (harsh), we tend to dislike one side of the cycle. The practice is to find peace *within* the cycle, not to permanently escape to one side.

### **Key Conceptual Metaphors**
*   **Kilesa as Bondage:** The teacher explicitly defines *kilesa* as **"a bondage, like handcuffs... or a ball and chain"** for the mind.
*   **Breathing as Nourishment/Cleaning:** The breath is portrayed as something that can **"nourish"** anxious parts of the brain (like the amygdala) and **"clean out"** sinus cavities clogged with metaphorical "phlegm" of boredom.
*   **Language as a Trap:** The dialogue itself is a meta-lesson on how language, especially **adjectives like "brutal,"** subtly reveals our aversion ("not liking") and colors our reality. Moving towards a "pure heart" or *samadhi* involves using language that aligns with reality ("everything is okay") rather than our reactive feelings.

### **Summary**
The teacher uses **accessible, physical metaphors** (tied animals, seeds, Jello, buckets) to make abstract mental processes tangible. **Stories from various traditions** (Biblical, parenting) provide relatable scenarios to illustrate Dhamma principles. The overarching goal is to help the student see their experience—particularly **boredom as a form of aversion ("not liking")**—more clearly and to develop playful, skillful means to work with it, rather than being driven by it.
