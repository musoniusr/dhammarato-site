### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Is nourishing. Oh, are you still there?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Oh, good, good, good.

**Speaker A:** And it's just really nourishing, you know. So I'm really grateful for it. And I really, you know, the other thing I really appreciate about you personally is you seem, you know, very joyous. You seem very happy. And you seem to really exemplify you know, what it is you're talking about. And I wish that wasn't as quite as rare as, you know, what I experience, you know. And I've been around the block a couple times. I'm not the most dedicated practitioner. I don't, you know, I don't do a retreat a month or whatever, but I've done a few, you know. I've lived in Zen centers and I've done some practice over the years, but I really appreciate your dedication, your joy, and I'm watching the recordings of Alex and just really enjoying that and your dedication to that. It's really really helped me. So really been beneficial.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, there's several things that can be said about some of the stuff that you're talking about. Let's start this way. Most Westerners who come to Buddhism, they don't come to the real teachings of the Buddha. They're not available. What they come to is Western Buddhism. And Western Buddhism has a whole lot of Western ideas about what Buddhism should and ought to be. And so you'll find a lot of Westerners who become teachers, they try to present themselves as stone statuary because that's their idea of the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. In the time of the Buddha There were three symbols. One was the Dhamma chakra or the Dharma wheel. The other one was the Bodhi leaf from the tree. And the third one was a picture of a representation of a tree with a seat, a seating place, an empty seating place under it. It wasn't until Greek influence in India that statuary ever became part of Indian culture. Starting at around 300 BC period of time. And all of a sudden there's a huge amount of statuary, Buddhist and otherwise, that spring up in India. Okay. And so this, the icon of a sitting statue of a Buddha did not exist until about 200 years after the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Interesting.

**Speaker B:** And most of the statues that they had at that time were also not in the sitting posture. But in all of the postures altogether, so that it was just one of four postures. And so there's a lot of Asian lying Buddhas or reclining Buddha statues. There is also a lot of statues of the tudong monk. Now, the tudong monk is actually a picture of a walking monk, except that he's walking with all the paraphernalia that the monks would use to go camping. You could say, in fact, say that the possessions of the monk is nothing but 2,500-year-old versions of modern camping equipment. The robe itself is the tent. Also, they would have an umbrella, but the umbrella always has a hook at the top of it so that the pole can be taken out to where with us we think of the umbrella as the pole that is carried with the umbrella rather than taking the pole out and using the umbrella as a tent. OK, so the tudong monk is going to have his bowl, his Sangha robe, and his umbrella. But the picture is of him walking an active a piece of statuary. You also have a few statues, a lot of statues actually, of a standing Buddha, but almost always they have it with the hand out like this, the radiating hand that's put out. And the idea is that you put your attention, your mindfulness, your awareness on your hand as if it were radiating joy, love, supersonic vibrations, magical X-rays, anything like that. But okay, that's how— that's how you hold a handout with your awareness on that place. And there's a lot of statues for that, but the Western mind has gotten the sitting statue, and that they think that to become a Buddha you got to sit without recognizing that if you see those Buddha statues, every one of them has a slight smile. Smile on the face of the Buddha. Right. That is often missing.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Is that smile. Okay. And then, um, there's many different talks that I've had with people about it, uh, where The actual Mahasi Sila and what he taught is not what has become the Mahasi Method in the West. Not the same thing. Why? Because they always leave a few pieces out. It's almost like this: every deck of cards eventually becomes not a deck of cards because one or more cards turns up missing. And yet many people will continue to play with the deck of cards even though Some of the cards are missing, and they may or may not even know that there are cards missing or which cards are missing. Okay, that's what's happened to Western Buddhism. In fact, you can think of the teachings of Buddha as very much like a puzzle. Let us use the example of a jigsaw puzzle. And the way that we do jigsaw puzzles is we start looking at the pieces, noticing the colors, and eventually we get some colors together and try to fit the pieces together. Western Buddhism has two problems with that jigsaw puzzle. One is that we don't really have a good picture of what it is that we're trying to put together. In fact, some of the most difficult jigsaw puzzles, the whole thing is just black. There is only one color there. It's all black. It's a great big puzzle, and you've got to figure out how to do it without seeing any of the colors. Okay, well, Western Buddhism comes like that because even though those colors are there, we still don't know what the picture is. We don't know what we're looking for. Everybody's got their own ideas of what a Buddha is, and almost always it's got influences from Christianity. So sure, we put the Buddha up there with Jesus.

**Speaker A:** So true, so true.

**Speaker B:** And so The jigsaw puzzle has another problem other than we don't know what the puzzle is that we're trying to put together, and that is it's got pieces missing. Yep, it's like Leroy Brown. He's like a junkyard dog with a couple of pieces gone. Yep, yep, right. That's the problem. Well, what pieces are missing in the jigsaw puzzle? Joy. That's what's missing in the Western, because in fact we take Buddhism and try to turn it into something that we already understand, which is Christianity. Christianity is based upon suffering, and then if you suffer enough, then you'll get forgiveness, you'll get grace, and Allah will have mercy upon you rather than justice. I've had enough justice now, I want some mercy. Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's not what the teachings of the Buddha is about at all. Buddha is not going to save your ass. He's not going to. Neither will Jesus. Neither one of them are saviors. What they are are examples of what you could be doing yourself. Go save your own butt.

**Speaker A:** And this just leads us to the idea of gladdening the mind. Is that where this goes? Is that what you're ultimately leading a student to, is to gladden the mind?

**Speaker B:** Actually, there are 4 things.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And that we could say that when we have these 4 things, then those combine together in a whole to make something new.

**Speaker A:** New.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so there's a fifth thing which is a product of the four things that we put together. Okay, and that once that thing is now there, manifests, that fifth thing, it has characteristics or attributes. And if we define those characteristics and attributes in three ways, then that gives us 4 1 is 5 3 is 8. This is the Eightfold Noble Path. Okay. I have to think of it as a 4-1-3 combination. Okay. And yet, being fair, we try to divide the Eightfold Path into three, which I just did. And then in fact, I put it into the three is wisdom, the four things. Giving Samadhi, the fifth thing, which then brings about right livelihood, right effort, excuse me, right speech, and right action, which is now the Sila. So Pañña, Samatha, Sila is the method that we practice, and yet most people hear the Eightfold Noble Path is Sila, Samatha, Pañña. You start with the Sila, you get your act together, then you get your mind together, and then you can seek correctly. We're doing all of that backwards.

**Speaker A:** Are we doing it backwards, or would you say that it's something that takes place at the same time, like all.

**Speaker B:** These elements work together? Well, That's true if it's correct. The problem is, is that when people are ordinary people, they start with the precepts. Yes. All right. And if we think of it correctly, we're actually saying that the precepts is the outcome of a mind that is whole.

**Speaker A:** And noble.

**Speaker B:** A mind that is satisfied. A mind that is satisfied. A mind that is noble. A mind that is whole. And if the beginner student is lucky, that means that when he remembers to be correctly behaved, whatever it is, that he's in the process of telling a lie and he shuts his mouth or something like that, it's because at that particular instant in time, his mind.

**Speaker A:** Became.

**Speaker B:** Noble. Anapanasati. Right. The Sati, to remember, which Sati, by the way, is one of the four. So let's start with that and work with it this way. Okay. Sati is the first thing. Without Sati, without remembering that we can change, we can't change. Yes. Okay, that's the first thing. The second thing is, is to really do an investigation, to look at what's going on, to be honest with ourselves in our investigation, and not an investigation of in the past, but an investigation of what's happening right now. How do I feel? What am I thinking? What's really going on right now is to be investigated. Okay. And Anything that is happening right now could be improved. Okay. So what we're investigating is what can we do to make an improvement with this? Is this good enough as it is, which is often the case, or can we do something to fix it, to make it a little bit better? This is the investigation for wholesome versus unwholesome thoughts, so that we can see the thoughts are unwholesome. Versus thoughts that are wholesome. If we wake up and recognize that the thoughts that I'm having right now are wholesome, yippee! Right, okay, we got it. Yeah. If we wake up and recognize that this thought is not wholesome, now we take the right effort to change it, to fix it, to make it more wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Right. And may I ask you.

**Speaker B:** A question?

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, you just said so. I know, I just don't interrupt. When you talk about wholesome, are we talking about what is true right now? What is great about this moment and what I'm experiencing that's satisfying for myself? I'm breathing, I'm safe, all of the things that are not a part of what you said last time, what's dangerous about the past, perhaps what's dangerous about the future. So unwholesome becomes really more about what's unreal and what's imaginative and what isn't true, but we fear or we resist or we reject, this kind of thing. And that wholesome becomes becoming— I think friendship is something you've spoken about, embracing not only what we don't like, but You know, but what is sort of the fuller experience of our life as it is right now? And, you know, I don't mean to take over the conversation. I want to listen to you, but I really want to understand this idea of wholesome and unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** All right, let's go into that. Okay, let's go into that. The first thing that we can say about it in the sense of hindrances is a hindrance is anything that's going to keep you from feeling the way that you want to feel. Most people don't even know that they have a choice about how they want to feel, and so they've never investigated, what would I feel like if I wanted, if I could feel the way that I wanted to feel? How would you feel if you could.

**Speaker A:** Feel the way that you wanted to feel? Yes, I know that. I can tell you that right now. I want to feel satisfied. I want to feel at peace. I want to feel like there's nothing left to be done. That's exactly how I want to feel.

**Speaker B:** So my wife, anything, anything that prevents.

**Speaker A:** You from feeling that— oh, excuse me, John. Excuse me, Dhammarato. I'm sorry, Gwen, just take it off. Take, take it off the top. Will you excuse me for one moment? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Here, let me do it. Let me do it. I got it.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker A:** Got it. Here we go. Good. Is that better? It's good. Okay. I'm so sorry. This is our— this is my first call it. She's already in bed. She's asleep. My wife's asleep. So we didn't realize— I didn't realize she would be disturbed by our conversation. So excuse me.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry. So the question is, if you could feel the way you wanted to feel, yeah, how would you feel now? The hindrances are anything that will hinder us from feeling the way that we want to feel.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't want to feel dissatisfied. I mean, I'm really not. Would you say that, you know, we're not really making a decision about how we don't want to feel? We don't want to feel dissatisfied, right?

**Speaker B:** I mean, You know what I'm saying? That's the whole point, is people are not thinking and making that decision. They're not looking at what's going on. They go ahead and feel the way that they started to feel without recognizing.

**Speaker A:** That they have a choice, right? And the choice is to choose to, um, uh, to embrace, um, thoughts and experiences that are wholesome. And wholesome experiences are that which does not generate dissatisfaction, that which is not generating this Dukkha. Wholesome experiences are generating Sukkha, are generating experiences of satisfaction. Just like you were kind of catching me in our last conversation, you're like, oh, you don't want to be late. Right? I think I was thinking about that, right? You were kind of like calling me on that, if I'm not mistaken. And you were saying, oh, you don't want to be late, you know? And so there's some Dukkha there. Whether I'm late or not, there's a little Dukkha there. I'm doing that to myself, right? My hand is on the stove and I don't have the good sense to just take the hand off the stove, right? Is that so?

**Speaker B:** Is that so? Exactly. That's the whole point. Point that being late is just setting it up so that you can make a.

**Speaker A:** Grand entrance, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. You get everybody's attention when you go in late. If you're.

**Speaker A:** Early, then you're part of the crowd. Yeah, but I mean, but I think what you're saying is, is that, you know, you know, is that we're generating our own Dukkha. I mean, the Buddha is talking about the fact that how we think and how we feel is directly related to whether or not we're going to acknowledge a wholesome or unwholesome thought, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, those are two things that are deeply bound up together in the sense that we have a choice about how we feel if we know we have a choice about how we feel. And if we don't know that we've got a choice about how we feel, then we wind up feeling the way that we would ordinarily have felt. But once we start waking up, we recognize that we do have a choice. Now, that's in fact a way of looking at the Second Noble Truth. The whole point of the Second Noble Truth is to recognize our own personal responsibility. Dukkha does not happen because he shot me. Dukkha happens because I don't like that he shot me.

**Speaker A:** The two darts.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the first dart is the unimportant one. Yeah, but it unleashes the second dart, which is the one I don't like what he did. Yeah. Okay, and so now we feel bad. That's the hindrance. Yes, other people don't make us feel bad. We choose to feel bad based upon what they said. Yes. And when we were in the process of waking up is to recognize that at any moment we've got a choice about how we're going to think and how we're going to feel. This is what the practice is all about. And every new moment is new, which means we have the opportunity to remember to act as if this is a new moment. But we are in such a habit of the past that we treat this moment as if it were the same as the old moments. Yes, we live in the past, dwell in the past, and we don't see that the future is different than the past. Yes, but if we see this present moment as a brand new moment, it's a new opportunity to feel the way.

**Speaker A:** That I want to feel. Yes, and when you say that, you're not saying that like it— you've said that in other conversations that I've watched, you're not speaking to the fact that that's an affirmation. You're speaking to that as the fact that that's a truth. You know, the way that I want to feel is not about how I want— I would like to be, like I would like to be beautiful or thin or a millionaire, but it's about—.

**Speaker B:** It'S about those things you're feeling. Because you could be a millionaire and there's a million different ways a millionaire can feel. Yes, you're jealous, he could because he doesn't have 2 million, he can feel afraid because he might lose that million, etc., like that. Okay, so yes, that's what the problem with affirmations are, is that they're not real.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but what you're talking about is what's real. What's real?

**Speaker B:** Yes, what's real, or at least real in the sense of absolutely potentially available. That's wholesome, right? A million dollars is not easily available, but that is easily available.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, or a gentle breeze that's pleasing, the warmth of the sun, you know, the proximity of a loved one, the community of Sangha, these are all real. That's all beautiful, right?

**Speaker B:** That's all wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** But the girl standing in front of the mirror saying, oh, I'm so beautiful, when in fact she doesn't believe it. Yeah. That's why she's standing in front of the mirror trying to convince herself of something that she doesn't believe.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Right. And why should the girl actually even want to be beautiful? Why can't she say, I'm good enough, I'm the ugliest kid in the class?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's, you know, the thing I've been thinking about too is the talk you gave regarding stop, you know, about the guy who was collecting fingers for his necklace. I forget the name. And the Buddha kept saying stop. And then he said, stop, Buddha. And he said, I have stopped. And I've really been thinking a lot about that, you know, in regard to what we're discussing. I mean, it's really just about that. It's just really about whether you decide.

**Speaker B:** To stop or not stop. Right. To be able to see that unwholesome stuff and put a stop to it. Now, many people will use the word in our language of suppression. We're not suppressing anything. We've stopped it.

**Speaker A:** Instead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, um, uh, I guess it would be a difference between, uh, being on the ground strangling a rodent that is fiercely fighting us would be suppressing it versus just merely killing the rodent. Okay, we're not trying to suppress anything, we're just going to kill it instead. Yeah, yeah, but the mind moments are like that, that everything lives and dies, everything arises and passes away, arises and passing away. So recognizing that that unwholesome thought is passing away. Yeah. And I'm going to have a new thought, more wholesome, arise in its place, because that's what we're working with. So this is part of that group of four that we were talking about, and that is to wake up, to look at what you're doing, and then do a course correction, make a change to it. Yes. What— whatever thought that you've had in your mind, you could have a better, more wholesome thought than that, probably. Yeah. And if you can't have a more wholesome thought than this, then congratulate ourselves with what a marvelous thought this is. Yeah, yeah. So we can keep doing this practice over and over again. These three things run and circle around each other, and that Sati, to wake up. Uh, Ditti, to look, to investigate. Okay, this is not a worldview. This is a looking at what's going on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah. And then the next one is the right effort. And right effort and right viewing and right Sati run in circle around each other. Gaining momentum, gaining skills. And when he gets the momentum going, then we add a fourth spoke to the wheel, and that fourth spoke is called in Nepali Samma Sanghappa. And Samma Sanghappa is attitude. It's often translated as right intention, which is correct. But right thought is not. Okay, that in fact, uh, if it is a thought, it's a very, very quick kind of thought. The example would be when a tree is cut down, which direction is it going to fall?

**Speaker A:** It's going to fall in the direction you cut.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's going to fall in the direction that it's leaning. Okay. And you cut it so that it leans in a particular direction. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, you make it weak in the direction that it's going to lean, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** If you think of that, then you can recognize that that's what attitude is, is how we're leaning, because that's the direction that our thoughts are going to start falling. Okay, in other words, this is faster than a thought. At least as faster than a verbal kind of dialogue in the mind. It is an attitude, and that attitude comes up really, really fast. Okay, now let's look at something that is vertical. In other words, it's not leaning in this direction, it's not leaning in that direction, but it's vertical. Because it's vertical, it doesn't have any gravity pulling it down. But if it's leaning, just like the tree If you cut the tree and cut it down to where it's got no leaning, it's not going to fall. In fact, the way that the beavers cut it is they cut it around and around and around to the point that it's like toothpick sticks like that. But as long as the tree is completely vertical, it's still not going to fall over. But it will fall when it's leaning and it will fall in the direction that it's leaning. And our mind is like that too. So the mind is going to fall in the direction that it's leaning. And by taking the practice of remembering to take a look and to make a change, and to remember to take a look and see what's going on and making a change, and we do that over and over and over and over again, We begin to change the attitude of how things are leaning. When we were little kids, we were born as a victim. We can't feed ourselves, we can't clothe ourselves, we can't talk, we can't tell the big people what we want or anything like that. That we're victims, we're born victims, and the big people make sure that we stay victims. Right. By the time we're 6 years old, we become a victim of the school. We become victims of ABCs and 1-2-3s and all of that kind of stuff. Kids, sit down and do your homework. Go clean your room. And so we remain victims. When do we ever become champions?

**Speaker A:** We have to think for ourselves.

**Speaker B:** We'll stay in that victim's mentality and they lean towards victimhood for the rest of their lives. This is one of the places where— and this happens in all occasions, we're talking about music, we're talking about code writing, we're talking about martial arts, we're talking about archery, any skill that you learn, you start off no good at it and you know you're no good at it. But in fact, we all need a little bit of beginner's luck. We all need that beginner's luck, because what is the beginner's luck? It gives that child an attitude that he can do it. If he did it one time, he can do it again. Right, right. That's what we're developing. We're developing the attitude that I can change my mind, I can improve, I can change the unwholesome thought into the wholesome. And that means that we're now beginning to change our attitude from that of a loser who has the attitude of, oh, meditation is hard, oh, I can't do it, oh, this is difficult, I don't know what they're getting out of it. That's the attitude speaking.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And we change that attitude into the attitude of can do. That in fact, in Sutra number 48, the Buddha makes the statement after a long description of hindrances and obstacles to telling what they are. He then makes a statement that the first knowledge, the first step on the Noble Path, is when the student has the attitude that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, no matter what hindrances are there, he can wake up, change that stuff, throw that out. And be here in the present moment and see the reality of the situation. And that's a pretty heavy-duty good attitude. Yes, liberation. A liberation that no matter how bound up, tied up, restrained I am, I.

**Speaker A:** Can get out of it. And would you say that unwholesome in this language is delusion? And wholesome is reality. Wholesome is actually our experience. I'm sitting here, I'm comfortable, I have a loving wife, I'm speaking with a Dharma teacher, a Dharma friend. I mean, this is a great situation. It has nothing to do with anything that I would be dissatisfied by. But I bring dissatisfaction into my experience.

**Speaker B:** I introduce it or I allow it. The operative word is bring because you were already carrying it.

**Speaker A:** What was the operative word?

**Speaker B:** Carry. You use the word carry. Yes. Which means that you're bringing it with.

**Speaker A:** You from the past.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, that's right. It's not new Dukkha, it's old habits.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is, it is, absolutely.

**Speaker B:** It's not in the present moment. And the attitude is that we are from that past is when we were really little kids up until the present.

**Speaker A:** Moment, we were victims.

**Speaker B:** Right. But we're going to change that attitude to become a champion. But we need to do that repeating it over and over and over and over again, sort of like it soaks in. You've heard the story of the, let us say, artificial plastic sponges, but the same thing happens with cloth. A terry cloth, a towel, rejects the water. Even when you immerse the towel in water, it still rejects it so that you can immerse the towel completely, pull it out, and there'll still be dry spots in it. Or if you drop water on an artificial sponge, the water doesn't soak in immediately. It sits on the surface. There's water surface tensions and all kinds of stuff like that. But if we keep dropping water on that sponge, it will begin to take it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So this is part of the quality of Repetition, doing it over and over and over and over again and keep putting more water on it. And pretty soon we recognize, hey, part of the sponge has gotten wet, right? It's getting wet, guys. And so that's when the attitude comes in, is the recognition.

**Speaker A:** Of success. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have to create something in the sense of doing something that is successful. And what is that? The effort that it takes to change the mind from an unwholesome state to a wholesome state. We keep doing that over and over and over again until we get that beginner's attitude of, yeah, I can do this. If I remember, I can do this. So I put some absent conditions on it, then I can do this. But eventually it comes to the point of it does not matter how interrupted the mind is. It doesn't matter how much Dukkha it is. It doesn't matter if they're coming in and saying, oh, your mom just died, or maybe it's a cop wanting to arrest you or whatever it is. You can handle it. And you know that you can handle it. You can handle anything. This is the attitude that we're talking about is the attitude of I can do it. I can handle anything. Doesn't matter what happens, I can handle it. I can handle that visa office. I can handle an IRS agent. I can handle famous people. I can handle being criticized. I can handle, you know, whatever it is. That's the attitude that we're developing.

**Speaker A:** Wow, you just ticked down my list. Yeah, that's great. And when we're talking about what's wholesome and what's unwholesome, unwholesome is essentially related to the hindrances, essentially related to ill will, or how we interpret that, how we expand upon the concept of ill will.

**Speaker B:** The biggest one is wanting something we don't have. Okay. I want something I don't have, I've got to go get it. Yeah, I can't be satisfied without it. I've got to go get it. Yeah, so being in a position of wanting something that you don't have is Dukkha. That's a classical definition of Dukkha, being dissatisfied because we don't have what we want. Amen. And yet here's all of these people sitting down in meditation wanting to be enlightened.

**Speaker A:** That's right, wanting the big experience, the big enlightenment, the transformation, the magic. Right, you know, like, I mean, God, I've been down that road. I, you know, I mean, you have more than I have, but I— one of the reasons why I'm so attracted to what you're saying is because I've been on that road. The magical Buddhism, the magical this, the magical that, you know. Yeah, sorry to interrupt.

**Speaker B:** Well, once the magic though is in this change of attitude from I want something, enlightenment, versus wow, this is great, This is good enough. I don't know what enlightenment is, but I'm not going to trade this for that. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And how could that not be possible if it weren't true that when you read the suttas, it talks about how people would hear the Buddha and then they would get it? Like that moment they would get it. It wasn't a 20-year thing. They would get it that moment. They would see what he's saying, understand the value of it, It would penetrate and bam, that was it.

**Speaker B:** He knew how to speak to somebody. He got it right to them. Okay. And they, and they get the point and they understand. That doesn't mean that that person walks away all enlightened for the rest of his life, but it knows. But it does point out that now he knows what to do. Now he's got a direction. Now that things are straightened out, he can figure out where what to do. And that's the attitude that I can figure out. I don't know everything, but I can figure out what I need to figure out. I can handle it. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So now that we've got that down, the second statement that the Buddha makes is that this point that we get, this attitude that I can handle anything, is the first step on the Noble Path. This is supermundane. It is noble. It is a factor of the path, and it is not held by ordinary people. Most people do not have the attitude that they can handle anything. I mean, look at the number of professions that have risen up because people didn't think that they could do it themselves. Automobile mechanics, Dentist, look at that. Okay, yeah, how about lawyers and doctors? I mean, look at all the— how about Gucci? I can't live without Gucci, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right, right. You got to have somebody else validating.

**Speaker B:** Your decision and your investment, right? And so here we're bringing that home and saying, I'm the boss here. Yeah, this is my life and I'm.

**Speaker A:** In charge of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that we don't— that in fact that's what we're actually doing. We're taking charge of our life rather than being the child victim that was dependent upon all of these other people to make me feel the way that I want to feel, rather than recognizing I can do that myself. I can feel any way that I.

**Speaker A:** Want to when I remember. It's a pretty.

**Speaker B:** Dangerous proposition. It is dangerous. This part of the problem that people can hear the Dhamma and fall into wrong view. Now, what is wrong view can be stated as, I can get what I want and get away with it. I can do anything I want to do and get away with it because they'll hear the part of the Buddhist teaching that you're responsible, you can get what you want, and that you're not subject to the past. But ordinary right view is a very conservative view. It's the conservative view of, oh, if you do good, you'll get good results, and if you do bad, you'll get bad results.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And there are people who have done good, and there should be examples for you, and there are people who have done bad, etc., like that. But basically what this means is, is that they set it up In the sense that you are bound by the past and bound by the future, because you're bound by the actions. Yeah. But if we think that we are not bound by them, then that gives us the wrong attitude that we can get away with anything. We can harm people and go about that. But the Buddha teaches, no, there is good action that gives good results, and there is bad action that gives bad results, but it's based upon conditionality, cause and effect. It's not based upon magic. There is something real in there that is not a super daddy or a sky daddy or, uh, cameras everywhere that's going to punish you. You're doing the punishment yourself in your own mind. It's in your own mind, precisely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you bring these things together, these four things of wake up, Look at what you're doing, make a change, and congratulate yourself. This congratulations is also what we could call nurturing thought versus critical thought. Critical thought saying, oh well, you did this right but you've got that wrong. Nurturing thought says everything is okay, what you did is just fine, get over it. Right, but our critical system that we have in the West is, oh no, we have to look for the good and the bad and the ugly. Yeah, rather than just be satisfied without labeling things good, bad, and ugly.

**Speaker A:** I'm okay with it. Right, right. We have our parent, as you say, our superego monitoring our every moment.

**Speaker B:** And not only just monitoring it, but setting it to a standard. And what we're doing here is investigating those standards. If they're real, we don't have to apply that standard. We can be nurturing instead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that standard is really the hand on the, um, on the, uh, you know, the stovetop. And I recognize that I'm burning my hand, I take it away. You know, right? That's the rational choice, right? And we're talking about a rational decision about what we're doing to ourselves and what we're not doing to ourselves. Does that apply?

**Speaker B:** But we have to look at that. We have to do that evaluation and investigation in order to see that this is not wholesome that I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And wholesome is that which is contributing to Sukkha, contributing to satisfaction, contributing to reality, contributing to my actual status, my actual state of being, and not the one that I worry about or that I insist on, that I want, that must be otherwise. I can't fulfill the agenda that has been introduced to me or that I insist on. Does that follow?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. So when we bring these four items together, especially the Samma Sanghappa, the changing of the attitude, this begins to gather things together and we become unified. We're no longer at war with each other about setting rules that I can't manage. We stop criticizing ourselves in the sense of the one who is criticizing is finding fault with that part of us that is being criticized. When we're nurturing, we come back together like a mom and an infant in her arms, as opposed to a mom who's pointing her finger at the naughty child. Yeah, that's the duality. Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so we begin to bring together all of the constituent component parts, and this is what makes the mind Samadhi. The Buddha talks about it in the beginning of the sutra. He says, monks, listen carefully, and I will tell you about right unification of mind, right organization of mind with its supports and features. So what we've been talking about are the supports. The supports is wake up, look at what you're doing, make a change, and congratulate yourself. Wake up, take a look, make a change, and congratulate yourself over and over and over and over again. And this brings the mind into a state of unity where you're not a crowd anymore. Okay, so let's look at that for a moment. And that is, is that when the mind is noble, when it's unified, when you're satisfied, when you don't want anything, then you're very unlikely to kill somebody to get it. Indeed. If you are whole and wholesome and noble and the mind is unified and you don't want anything, it's very unlikely.

**Speaker A:** For you to steal it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. When you're at rest with all of the people and everybody that you're around, it's unlikely that you're going to start gossiping about a third person and telling lies. Yeah. And if you already feel really, really good, you don't need to go looking for some alcohol or something to make you feel good, some medicine or anything like that, that you're already okay. So our precepts fact are not precepts saying this is a set of Buddhist rules that you're supposed to follow. When we think of it that way, that's ordinary Buddhism. When we think of the precepts as those things that we can put our mind into right here, right now. So here's an example of that. Let us say that the old Jewish rabbi is the kosher dude in town, and it's his job to kill every goat in town because he's got to do it in a ceremony. He's got to do it correctly because this is all Jewish and everything, or Islamic if you want to go that route. And this old rabbi comes out one day with his sharpened knife, and there's that goat with a big smile on his face winking at the guy. And he gets a heart, and he recognizes he can't kill that goat right now. He can't do it. And he might set that knife down and walk away from that goat, and he may never pick that knife up if he got that lesson that you can't go around killing. Even if it's part of our religion, even if it's done kosher, it's still killing. Yeah. And so he's going to stop because of his mind becoming noble, right? He would have not stopped no matter what. Somebody, they could have wrestled him to the ground and said, don't kill that goat, and he'll get up with his knife and kill the goat. Yeah. Okay, so this is how we do it, is that it's not that we do it because it's a set of rules. Then in fact, we set rules for kids because they're not wise or too stupid. And so we set the rules with punishment. We're saying that we're going to make sure that you understand that this behavior is dangerous. And so we create artificial dangers. We make punishments for things rather than having as natural outcomes. So our society is built upon a punishment model, but the teachings of Buddha are built upon a.

**Speaker A:** Rehabilitation model. I think I recall you saying something to the effect that the Brahma-Viharas follow the same line of experience, that they are a result of our state, our experience, and not something that we're practicing, something we're trying to artificially manifest. Which would be essentially unwholesome, I guess. But the wholesome result of our experience of being satisfied would be loving kindness, would be compassion, would be equanimity, would be— forgive me, the fourth one. But— Upekkha. Thank you. Shucks, I can't remember the English. Equanimity, right? Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, a better word for it would be good balance, dynamic balance. Okay, dynamic balance, that's the way of looking at it. And Tanisaro has— Arahant Tanisaro has given a very good example of that, and that is the doctor. A good doctor has loving kindness for his patients. That's why he's a doctor. He wants to do something good. When he is with a patient who has a disease, it's possible for him to catch that disease. That would be real compassion. If somebody is sick with the disease, the only way that you could be with them in their passion is to get sick with them. Yeah, to have a pity party with them. Yeah, if somebody is angry, they want everybody around them to be angry, right? Misery loves company. Yeah, the doctor's got to make sure that he stays safe so that he does not catch the disease. I mean, this was very common with the COVID when it first started, is all the nurses were getting sick with COVID right? They weren't taking the correct precautions to stay out of it. Okay, so real compassion means that you don't get sick. Okay, and so the Mudita, the third one, is giving the actual cure, the real cure, which in our case would be joy, would be happiness, would be satisfaction. So we actually work with people who are in a pity party to help them to cheer up and to come out of their pity party, rather than join them and say you've got a right to feel bad. Hit 'ain't it awful that he beat you up,' or whatever. So yeah, a better way to say it is, 'Huh, that's not much of a bruise at all. It's just a little bruise. You got out of that really easily.' Okay, right. So that's Mudita, sympathetic joy.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just, uh, I was saying it reminded me— what you were saying just reminded me of, uh, about what you talked about, that the Buddha taught two things, Dukkha and Nirodha. And what you're speaking to, I think, is the Nirodha, right? You're talking about expressing that experience, not only your own personal experience, but how you're helping other people with it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. So that would be the friendship that's both sides. The inside is, is that I could come and nurture myself and feel really good, and then I can go over and be around people who are miserable and help them to feel good too without getting sick with the disease that they have.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And would you call that a gladdening of the mind? Right. I mean, is it the gladdening of their minds?

**Speaker B:** Yes. I mean, uh, when I smile, people smile. When I joke and grin, they grin too. It's— yeah, yeah, it's a sympathetic vibration. If I come on really tough and angry like that and tell you how bad the United States government is, and now this political party is terrible, and they do this, that, and the other thing, then you'll feel that way too. Yeah, you're not mindful if you're not awake. So when people feel a certain way and they want other people to feel that way The other people do and feel that way in sympathetic vibration, but here we're turning the tables around on that. We're not going to feel the way that they feel. We're going to continue to hold our joy and let that rub off on them rather than their misery rubbing off on us.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's not an affirmation. It's really, it's really just an acknowledgement of the fact that you're capable of seeing the thoughts that are unwholesome, that are dissatisfying, and returning your experience to what is satisfying, returning your experience to reality, which is not the dissatisfaction, which is not the unwholesome thought. And the training and the skill is to continually return to that, to continually repeat that until it becomes your general experience.

**Speaker B:** Is that— does that follow? Yes. So now let's look at Upekkha. Okay. All right, the doctor again, going back to the analogy of the doctor. As much as they want to cheer up their patients and get them well, some of the things that the doctor does actually is detrimental, and he sometimes kills their patients. In fact, more people die in the hospital hospital than anyplace else. That's a good reason right there to never go to a hospital. That's where you go to die. The doctors are waiting there to do it to you. Now here's the point. This is all still in ignorance. We don't have medical science down yet. And the proof of that is, is that every patient that every doctor has ever had dies. Some of the patients will outlive the doctor, but most likely the doctor is going to outlive a lot of old people that die right on his hands. Right. How does the doctor feel when he loses his patients one after another after another? Is he going to be strong-minded? Is he going to be able to handle that, or is he going to have something we call in our society now burnout? Teachers burn out, psychologists burn out, social workers burn out, nurses burn out, doctors burn out, cops burn out and burn up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Okay. All of these helping professions wind up having burnout because the individual that is practicing the profession doesn't have control over his own mind when he loses it. The doctors lose their patients. Okay. And so we have to have the sea legs to be able to handle the fact that the deck that we're on is up and down and up and down, and sometimes we lose and sometimes we win. Right. And so this brings another analogy of how to balance Imagine the old sea captain on his big fishing boat in high seas, and he's going from the bow to the stern. He can make it. But if you have a landlubber who has no sea legs and he's sitting on the bow of that ship with the captain, and the captain goes to the stern in high seas, the landlubber is not going to make it. He's either going to heave over the side or go over the side or bang into the cabin wall or try to grab rope to stand up because he can't handle it.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Hey, uh, Dhammarato, would you excuse me for one moment? Okay. I'm so sorry, I have to use the restroom.

**Speaker B:** Don't be sorry, just go do what you want. Don't take 10 minutes to apologize, just do it.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, sir. I'll be right back. You laugh. You laugh. Okay.

**Speaker B:** So sorry. What a— what a clear example of Upekkha that just happened. Oh yeah. Okay. Yes. Then in fact, here we were rocking along with the Dharma, and all of a sudden something in the other room gives a great big groundswell, and here you go up and down like that, and you didn't like it, and so you start apologizing. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry, I got to go take care of something, instead of just saying, I'll be right back, and just go.

**Speaker A:** Do it.

**Speaker B:** And the Anapanasati, we got to apologize, we got to be sorry.

**Speaker A:** And the apology is an element of what we're talking about when we're discussing dissatisfaction, but we're talking about, you know, how we upset ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Right, which just happened. You upset yourself because you had to leave our conversation for a short moment.

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right, right. Well, I think if I— I really hope that we continue talking and I get to know you better, and I'll trust the fact that I can just say, I'll be right back, because usually Usually I have to apologize so I don't offend somebody, you know what I mean? Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Well, you can't offend me. Anicca is because of the Upekkha, that your groundswell of leaving the room, I'm okay with that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Just because I lost my patience doesn't mean a thing. You died on me, but you came right back.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad I'm back. I'm glad.

**Speaker B:** I'm back. Yeah. Okay, so this is what we have as Upekkha, is the ability to handle the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. We learn to not be the target. The doctor has to learn that the patient died, it wasn't him that died, right?

**Speaker A:** And would Upekkha be quality of Sati? I mean, if I have the skill of Sati? Precisely. So Sati is not awareness. Sati is a remembering.

**Speaker B:** And Upekkha is awareness? No, Upekkha is the outcome of your ability to handle anything.

**Speaker A:** That comes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because I have the capacity to not identify with what happens. I have the capacity to not say that the things that are happening in my own mind are me, that these are things that are taking place. They're reactions. They're moments of dissatisfaction. They're not what I would call myself.

**Speaker B:** Another way of doing it or thinking about it is that Upekkha is the time to not apply the rules. Okay, okay. Don't apply the rule of gravity. Just because the deck went down doesn't mean you got to go down with it. Okay, so, okay, what happened though was, is that you decided to put in a rule. What was the rule? Thou shalt not leave Dhammarato. And go to the other room.

**Speaker A:** Thou shalt not do that. That's a big one. Thou shalt not leave Dhammarato. That's a big one. I barely know you. That's a big one.

**Speaker B:** I'm kidding. No, that's the whole point is you're not supposed to leave. And so when you have a reason, instead of the reality is that you need to go do something, so go do it. Yeah, instead of making it against some rule or something. And so this is the whole thing about the, uh, the superego is look at all the rules that we create for ourselves because that's what keeps us out of balance. Or we hurt— we're the rules to apply, then we're okay.

**Speaker A:** And we hurt ourselves, but right, we're hurting ourselves essentially, right?

**Speaker B:** You broke the rule.

**Speaker A:** You left Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, not only that, but you broke so bad, you broke another one because you knew in advance that you had to leave Dhammarato. So here you are apologizing about breaking a rule that you just broke, and now breaking a new one by leaving.

**Speaker A:** Bad Greg, right? Bad Greg.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. That's the point, is to stop with all of this critical thinking. Yeah. And be here now.

**Speaker A:** Right. Right. And that's the stop, right? That's the story about the stop, the finger hunter, or whatever his name was, I forget now. But that's, you know, the guy wanted the Buddha's finger. That's the point of the story, right? I mean, that's the point of the story is you're stopping, you are deciding to no longer participate in the You know, yeah, the rules and the compulsion and the training and, you know, the you must do this now. I mean, you know, I hear that and I agree with that and I completely see it and I experience it. But I also would not choose to be disrespectful to you. I would not choose to be impolite. You know what I'm saying? So like, I mean, that's not the same thing, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, I don't see anything like that. I would say an example of being rude or impolite would be like some of the comments that we get, like, "Who the hell do you think you are?" Because I've had those kinds of comments. Others would say, "I would like for you to be a teacher, but I disagree with you on this point or that point." Yeah, right. Okay, so saying that you don't agree or that you don't like something with someone, that's actually, if you think about it, that's impolite in all society. That's being rude everywhere. Yeah, when you try to confront people with what they've done wrong as an introduction, they don't— right out of the blue comes this, you know, giant criticism.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Without an actual engagement, without actually, you know, dialoguing with an individual.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, right. And so criticizing another person is rude. I mean, that's because they take it as feeling like that you've offended them, being offensive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And I think you had mentioned in one of your other talks about bad speech and how bad speech is really— not making bad speech is what has solidified and maintained the Sangha. That there is this important element of not making bad speech. Even if somebody does something wrong, it's not your business. And making bad speech is just starting.

**Speaker B:** To.

**Speaker A:** Kind of you know, uh, separate. Yeah, separate. Yeah, yeah. And it's not— that's not what we're looking for, right? And that's not— that's not the goal. Even if you don't understand or you don't agree, it's no excuse to make bad speech, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, if that's true on the outside, isn't it also true on the inside?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm making myself unhappy. By criticizing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's where those rules are, that if we make rules, then we'll criticize ourselves for breaking them, and we'll also criticize other people for breaking them. Yeah. Instead of— if we don't have any rules, then we're not criticizing anybody.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. And that's To me, if I understand it correctly, that's where we can be active. We can't be active in feeling because feeling is automatic. But we can be active in how we crave and how we cling. I don't know a lot about this, but I'm trying to understand. But dependent origination has these elements that are not really in our control and these elements that we can begin to achieve control.

**Speaker B:** And the control is— and as we do that, we begin to get quicker and faster. And so we begin to back into time, that repetitive cycle. And so what we could do is we can get into the cycle quicker and quicker and quicker. This is the teaching. And so the Paticcasamuppada is taught in forward order, but it's just in reverse order. A clear example of that would be if you're in an argument with someone, when do you wake up that you're in an argument with someone? When you start to yell? When you get the knives out? When you get into a duel? Yeah. When you're trying to bury a dead body? I mean, how long does the argument go Right. Or does somebody eventually figure out that this isn't the right thing, and so they slam the door on the way out? The final word is the slamming of the door.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. Now, if we've got that, then we can really start applying the Dhamma and recognizing that how many bad words or how many argumentative words are you going to say before you wake up to this argument? And can you shut your mouth after you've only said 7 dirty things? Yeah. Can you wake up after you say 3 dirty things? Yeah. You wake up after you said 1 dirty thing? In other words, an outburst, an expletive, a damn.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** What the hell are you doing? Yeah, right in the middle of that outburst, you could wake up then. That's getting pretty fast. To wake up. Okay. And so that's when we shut up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know, we can have the thought, but we don't let it out at all. We shut up before that argumentative word comes out. And now we have time to change our attitude.

**Speaker A:** And that attitude change would be what we speak about when we're saying gladdening the mind.

**Speaker B:** Is that correct? The mind has many different attributes to it. One is that it changes the way that we feel, and it also changes our mental attitude slowly over time.

**Speaker A:** And it's not an affirmation, it's not something I'm making up, it's not a fantasy. It is something that is becoming— it's something to represent the reality of my experience.

**Speaker B:** The reality is I don't have to.

**Speaker A:** Argue with her right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're right. The reality is I'll feel better if I stop arguing and start smiling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the reality is that I don't have to suffer.

**Speaker B:** The reality is I don't have to.

**Speaker A:** Put up with this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so we're dealing with reality. The reality is I don't have to say anything. Yeah, because if we're I'm going to get into trouble.

**Speaker A:** Better to shut my mouth. Yeah, I know that well. Yeah, I mean, anything else would take us into more of a magical perspective, right? You know, where we're making things up and we're in, you know, kind of what you speak about in terms of affirmations and how that doesn't actually fulfill the, you know, the tenets of what we're addressing, right? We're talking about wholesome and unwholesome. Unwholesome is actually really more of the magical, and wholesome is more of the reality.

**Speaker B:** The reality, exactly. Let's get real here. That in fact, that word of to see the reality, see the truth of the situation, is what we wake up to rather than the hindrances, is how bad can things be? Yes, you know, yes. So we come out of that negative thinking into looking at how good things.

**Speaker A:** Are actually right now. Yes, I think you say what-if-isms, right? Isn't that one of your phrases? What-if-isms?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, I bought that from.

**Speaker A:** The Republicans. That's a good— that's good.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad to hear that. What about isms?

**Speaker A:** Anagami.

**Speaker B:** They need help. You say, well, you did this. He says, well, what about that? And what about this over here? And what about them back there? You know, that's the what about ism, right?

**Speaker A:** It's nice, it's nice that there's something wholesome coming from that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But we do it. We make excuses and we say, well, what about this? And what about that? Sometimes what about it is good and we feel, but I'm not that. Or then we say, what about something that's bad? And you say, oh no, it could happen. Yeah. So what about isms are actually delusional thinking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, right. You know, I heard you talk about how our thinking is generating feeling and we can change how we feel by wholesome thinking. Is the opposite true? Do we have feelings that precipitate how we think?

**Speaker B:** And, you know— Oh, absolutely. Yes, they're very interconnected. That in fact, never mind where a feeling comes from, when you're in that feeling, it will cloud our thoughts. Okay, if we feel angry, our thoughts will be angry. They will be clouded by that feeling. They're not different. They're not too different. That's right.

**Speaker A:** That's— they're rising. They're rising together. They're rising together.

**Speaker B:** Well, at least in, in, uh, in, in a way that a fuse lights a bomb. Okay, the fuse came first, but the fuse can be pretty short.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so that's the whole idea of cause-effect, and that the body conditions the feelings, the feelings condition the mind, the mind conditions the feelings, the mind conditions the body. All psychosomatic, it's all wrapped together. But in order to understand that correctly, we have to pull these things apart and get a good handle on what is the body, how do I work with it, what are the feelings, how do I work with them, what is the mind. Because in fact, that's the procedure that we figure out: oh, the mind can control the feelings, the mind has influence over the body, the body has influence over the mind and over the feelings. An example of that is if you're sitting in a posture that's uncomfortable, then the mind will be uncomfortable, the feelings will be uncomfortable because the body is uncomfortable. If we rearrange the body so that it is comfortable, then that will help the mind become comfortable. But in order to rearrange the body to be comfortable, we have to have the thought, "Let me rearrange the body to make it comfortable." whole. Yeah. Wow, this stuff is all wrapped together.

**Speaker A:** I mean, it sounds, it sounds to me like we make three things, but we're actually talking about one thing.

**Speaker B:** Is that true? Right. Well, you can say a three-legged stool is a one thing, three-legged stool. Yeah. But it's not the same thing with one of the legs missing. So we have to understand each of these three legs in that stool. That way we can really understand it as a whole, is because we see how things fit together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but they're all sort of interrelated.

**Speaker B:** And there's no way of unrelating them. Well, that's what we mean by general systems theory. And you could say that the Buddhist teaching of Paticcasamuppada directly is general systems theory. Now, general systems theory has to do about is the system open or is it closed. What's the difference between an open and a closed system? For instance, the planet Earth is an open system. Why is that? Because it's got radiation from the Sun bombarding it on a regular basis. If you close that system, what would happen if you stopped having any daylight coming to the planet Earth? Bad news. Bad news. So you want to keep that system open. Yeah, with the human body, we can see it as sometimes it's open and sometimes it's closed. Sometimes we want to put it in a closed position so that we could do the repair work on the inside. That's what we mean by solitude, is getting the mind away from all of the outside influences so that we could do the repair job. A clear example, they talk about it, of building an airplane while it's in flight. Or another one would be doing an overhaul of an engine in a race. No, you got to pull over to the side of the road to repair the engine. Yeah, we need to get ourselves into seclusion that way. So that's one of the points that we're talking about. But another one is to recognize that the body, the feelings, and the mind are influencing one another and that we need to see those influences. We need to see it that way, that, oh, if I change my posture, I can't change the posture of the body without changing the posture of the mind. The mind is a forerunner for everything. But once I change the posture of the body and it feels good, now I can feel good. Now I can relax and the mind can relax. Relax. Okay, so these things are directly related with each other. Yeah. And to see that in a relationship is, uh, the actual practice of Anapanasati. In other words, how can you get the body relaxed if the mind is tensed up? Right, right. Oh yeah. Okay, so we have to— in order to relax the body, we have to have relaxing thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just relax. And when you speak about relaxing thoughts, you're speaking about thoughts that indicate our actual experience, not indicate the experience we.

**Speaker B:** Would like to have.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Is that correct?

**Speaker A:** Right now. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Right now.

**Speaker A:** Right now. Yeah. So I'm using my cognitive faculty to indicate the quality of my experience.

**Speaker B:** Is that correct? Yes. So let us say that we're in some sort of dialogue internally. And it can be many, many examples. An example would be I want to go on a diet, and so I agree I should go on a diet. And now all of a sudden I'm standing with the refrigerator door open and I'm in.

**Speaker A:** A war. Yeah, I've been there. I've been there.

**Speaker B:** Do I put that thing back in the refrigerator and shut the door and feel bad, or do I eat it and.

**Speaker A:** Feel bad?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so this is, this is the war. When we get organized and unified, then whether we eat that thing in the refrigerator or not is, is not the important thing. It's how we feel about what we're doing. And if I can feel good and put it back in the refrigerator, that's better than feeling good and having to eat it. Then in fact, what I'm eating may not be all of that delicious. But often we were told, and I was told this big time, I remember a big point about it when I was a kid, to eat what's on your plate. You eat what you're told to eat. You can't have dessert until after you eat. And what mom is saying is, is that I'm really sorry that the food that I made doesn't taste good.

**Speaker A:** Eat it anyway. Yeah, my job is to raise you and make sure you eat your food, right? Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Right. And my mom used the one is that all of these food-starving children in India, they're hungry, and here you have all of this food on your plate. You want— and my— and I was only 4 years old when I said this. I remember it. I says, here, Mom, send this.

**Speaker A:** To India. And I think, uh, no matter how delicious the food is, all kids do that, right? You know, I mean, regardless, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're picky little kids.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, picky, picky little buggers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Yeah. Uh, and, and mostly because we're afraid that we won't like it. Yeah, we're afraid that we won't like it, and therefore we don't like it, and we're afraid. Okay. And we don't recognize that— oh, wait a minute, I don't know whether I like it or not. Let me give it a go. Let me see what this is. Yeah, let me taste it and see without rejecting it offhand.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So, uh, we can do that without the food though. We can see that's with life itself. Rather than having a bunch of rules and a bunch of fears and all of this, let's pay attention to what's going on.

**Speaker A:** What's going on right now?

**Speaker B:** Right now.

**Speaker A:** What's happening right now? Right now. Right now. Like, right now, what's the reality of my experience and the thoughts that are indicating that experience, right?

**Speaker B:** And the breath that you're taking is keeping you alive right now, right? Right, right. You don't take this next breath, you're going to die. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how immediate the breath is. That's how important it really is. Yeah, I think it's life-giving.

**Speaker A:** Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I mean, I think what I'm really trying to get, you know, focused on and very clear on is the word unwholesome and the word— and the phrase gladdening of the mind. Like, those are the two things that I want to really be sure that I'm practicing you know, as carefully as I can. Because I think if I understand correctly, I think I understand Sati. I think I understand right attitude. I think I understand right effort. Maybe I don't, but I want to, you know, I see that when I'm aware— I understand. Okay, let me say— Okay, all right, I'll stop.

**Speaker B:** And that is that these are all skills to be developed. Knowing whether a thought is wholesome or not is a skill to be developed. That it is possible that you can say a group of words and that group of words in that order is wholesome, and you can say the same words and they're unwholesome. Okay. Okay. That's what makes it a little complicated, is the words that we're using doesn't determine whether it's wholesome or not. It has to do with our attitudes and our feelings about those words.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's like almost the context, right?

**Speaker B:** It's the context. Okay, so the next thing is, is that because this is a skill to be developed, there are a few unwholesome thoughts that we know for sure, absolutely without a doubt, these are thoughts that are unwholesome. Yeah. Thoughts of going out and killing a politician, thoughts of cruelty, being cruel to an animal. Okay, yeah, this would be unwholesome. Thoughts of wanting stuff that we don't have is a little bit more difficult to understand that that's an unwholesome thought. Yeah. Okay, so the next one is that there are going to be some thoughts that we do know that are going going to be absolutely wholesome, without a doubt, no doubt about it. This thought is going to be a wholesome thought, like, wow, what a relief it is. Okay, yeah. Now there is a wide variety of things in between, and it is your job to keep investigating, keep looking, keep noticing, so that you can figure out for yourself what is wholesome and what is not wholesome. Okay, the skill to be developed is not a question that can be answered. Okay, so wakey wakey, keep looking. Okay, noticing. Okay, and, uh, recognizing that some thoughts are just downright unwholesome. There's other ways that you can help understand this, and that is thoughts about the past and thoughts about the future are generally not wholesome. That doesn't mean that they're always not wholesome. In fact, I do have to do a visa once a year. If I think about that visa months in advance, that's unwholesome, because the data that they're looking for needs to be current. So I should not think about getting a physical exam until the week of the visa. Thinking about things off into the future— another example of that one would be, I've got to go to the bank. Yeah, how many times do I go to the bank in my mind without ever actually going to the.

**Speaker A:** Bank physically? Right. No, that one I know that one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, so those are all those unwholesome thoughts about going someplace and doing something and they're not actually doing it is unwholesome. Yeah, yeah. Writing an email Thinking about writing an email and then not writing the email is unwholesome. It's better to think about writing an email while you're writing.

**Speaker A:** The email. Would any wholesome thought ever.

**Speaker B:** Generate Dukkha? For somebody else, probably. But for you? But generally, it would be changing that wholesome thought into an unwholesome thought, and.

**Speaker A:** Then the Dukkha comes. Okay, okay. But we— yeah, okay. Yeah, I mean, I reflect that as I learn more about what you're teaching. I was reflecting on, I think it's the first chapter of the— shucks— the collection of the Buddhist sayings.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma— Dhammapada.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you. I'm sorry. And the first one, I think it's the twins, right? And it's talking about these two two different ways of thinking. And he opens that up with wholesome and unwholesome thinking. And to be honest, until I started following what you were talking about, I don't think I really understood that at all, because it was always about, well, just get rid of your thinking and discard your thinking and suppress your thinking. But it's actually more about how you're defining your thinking and qualifying your thinking.

**Speaker B:** And monitoring how you think. Exactly. So stopping what you're thinking is a highly developed skill. Let me use this example, this one fits for a lot of people. What's the difference between a wild stallion, that has complete freedom and goes wherever he wants, versus a very, very high quality trained prancing horse. What's.

**Speaker A:** The difference? I think a lot of time and effort, I suppose.

**Speaker B:** Skill, training, that kind of thing. The training. I mean, the wild horse put a lot of wild effort, time and effort out there, and he's still wild.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. Yeah, basically what we're talking about is the difference between a wild stallion that's out in the wild versus a trained animal is the boundaries that we set around the animal. So if the horse is in, uh, the wild, then he goes wherever and does whatever. But if he's fenced into a pasture, then he has to stay within that pasture. Yeah. So that pasture has got all kinds of green food and wonderful, and it's really great for the horse. And if he stays in that pasture, everything is cool. Now the next point is bringing the horse for training into the corral. Okay. And that means with the mind that In the beginning, the mind is all over the place. Yeah. And then we add wholesome thoughts. It's like putting up fences, putting up a boundary. There's places you don't go anymore. That's dangerous over there. You don't go into that ravine. You don't go into that thicket. You don't go into that cesspool. You stay within your boundaries. And then we bring it down to a corral. Where the horse could actually be trained. So we could do that with the mind also, down to the point that— and actually to work with the horse, let us say, a vet or whatever, because I was raised when I was in Oklahoma around animals like that. And you want to put them in a stall. If you get that animal in the stall Now you have control over it. So how that works with the mind is, is that unwholesome, wholesome thoughts mixed is just all over the map. We bring it down to put it into a pasture which is all wholesome. Then we put it down into a corral which would be like the length of a song or a particular chant. Or something like that. And then to further refine the mind, to put it down into a stall, would be like giving the mind a mantra. So the wild mind is all over the place, a mantra is not going to do that student any good. He's got to be able to get the mind a little bit under control by putting it into a pasture, by putting it only through some thoughts. Then we put it down to saying the same little group of things over and over again. And in fact, I've got one that was quite surprising. Have you ever heard of Ravel?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Have you ever heard of— what is it— Bolero? Yes. One of his pieces of music.

**Speaker A:** I've heard of it.

**Speaker B:** That's about it. Starts with a drumbeat and then the orchestra starts up pieces at a time, but it starts with this rhythm. Okay, now what happens is that in that third group it changes the dop into a triplet. So it's whole note, triplet, whole note, triplet, whole note, triplet, triplet, triplet, whole note. I'm doing that. What kind of thoughts are you having?

**Speaker A:** Uh, they were, they were diminishing.

**Speaker B:** You begin to see those things. You begin to really get fast with what you're doing because you've got to that standard. You've got that boundary, you've got that framework, you've got that song that you're singing. Or in this case with Bolero, you've got that beat, that complicated beat. Dot Triple it. Triple it. Triple it, triple it Triple it. So one thing has changed in that, but it makes it complicated enough that we have to keep focused on it. But while we're, while we're focusing on it, you can begin to see what else the mind is doing because it's jumping around. The minds are pretty fast thing. And this is helping us to more and more clearly see the unwholesome And you begin to see those things. You begin to really get fast with what you're doing because you've got that standard, you've got that boundary, you've got that framework, you've got that song that you're singing. Or in this case with Bolero, you've got that beat, that complicated beat. Dot, triplet, dot, triplet, dot, triplet, triplet. Triple dot. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So one thing has changed in that, but it makes it complicated enough that we have to keep focused on it. But while we're focusing on it, you can begin to see what else the mind is doing because it's jumping around. The mind's a pretty fast thing. And this is helping us more and more clearly see.

**Speaker A:** The unwholesome thinking, to see the unwholesome tendencies and nature of the mind. Is that.

**Speaker B:** True? Right, exactly. And so this is the value of doing those kinds of things so that eventually, like with bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath, that mind is so, let us say, settled down, where it's only down to two words, That's easy down to bring it down to no words at all.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** But it's a training. Yeah. And yet so many Westerners say, oh, you're supposed to stop the mind, and then they think they can do it. That's like saying, oh, you can go 200 miles an hour. Yeah, you can if you have a race car. You've got to go build a race car first before you do 200 miles an hour. Okay. Or you need to develop the skills to be able to stop the mind. And the way to stop the mind is by slowing it down, by giving it something very repetitive to do. And the first thing that we work with is the repetition of only having wholesome thoughts, whatever they are, over and over again. But it gives us a lot of variety.

**Speaker A:** Within that.

**Speaker B:** And the way that we practice is by getting wholesome thoughts, wholesome thoughts, wholesome wholesome thoughts and then start narrowing those wholesome thoughts down and narrowing them down further until there's only such a few different thoughts left that those are easy.

**Speaker A:** Enough to deal with. So it's a matter of refining our capacity to be aware that we are no longer afflicted by unwholesome thoughts. And we have kind of this complete, you know, we have a, you know, a capacity to be aware without them, in a sense. We're not trying to stop thinking necessarily, but it's, it's just a matter of.

**Speaker B:** Refining, learning to control the mind. Stopping the mind is only just one way of saying controlling the mind. We're not control the mind. And let's control it in whatever way we can until we get to the point that we've got the skill to.

**Speaker A:** The point that we can actually stop it. And but stopping it would be not necessarily something that you would do as part of how you would engage your life. It's something that's indicating that you have the capacity to be able to do that and separate yourself from unwholesome thinking.

**Speaker B:** Well, right. Now let's put one more point to it, and that is that the thoughts that we have we're talking about thoughts that are discursive thoughts, thinking thoughts that have words. Okay, but we have a lot of other kinds of thoughts too. The thoughts of sensual awareness. Okay, an example of that would be a diamond cutter. While he is examining that diamond and about to put the chisel on, he's watching what he's doing. His thoughts are not discursive thoughts, they're observational thoughts. Yeah, okay, okay. So that's another thing, is that when we get away from the discursive thoughts, then we can do more observational thoughts, okay? Like observing directly how we feel. So first we talk ourselves into feeling good, and then we stop talking to ourselves about how good we feel and actually experience how good you feel. Different kind of thinking. Yeah. So we have to make sure that in fact, if you're aware of the headphones that are on your head, first one ear and the other, while you're thinking about that, you're not talking to yourself about the headphones, you're actually experiencing the headphones as they're sitting there with.

**Speaker A:** The weight and other things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, so this is— there are more than one kind of thought, and yet we generally think of it as only as discursive thoughts, wordy thoughts. Most of your thoughts are not words at all.

**Speaker A:** They're almost like random thoughts, you know, just think thoughts that think themselves.

**Speaker B:** Random thoughts are much more of discursive. No, we're talking about observational thoughts.

**Speaker A:** What, the Diamond Cutter? Right.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. You're watching what's going on. And also, when you're breathing in and experiencing the breath, you're actually watching the breath, monitoring the breath. That's a form of thinking. Yes, but we're not talking, we're just observing.

**Speaker A:** So it's an intent.

**Speaker B:** When you see something in the distance and you don't know quite what it is, you'll hone in on it and look. You're not thinking while you're doing that, not discursive thoughts. You're actually looking with your eyes, and looking takes time. That looking is a mind moment or two or three or four that has no discursive thoughts in it at all. You go around stopping your mind from discursive thoughts on a regular basis. Yeah. But we think that we're thinking all the time. No, we're not thinking discursive thoughts all the time. Most of the time that we're thinking.

**Speaker A:** Is observational, being our senses.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. So when you hear a big noise, you're actually hearing the noise, and then we start thinking about what that could be. We try to identify what that sound is, right? So there's the two kinds of thinking. One is hearing it, And then number 2, trying to figure it out. That trying to figure it out is.

**Speaker A:** The discursive thought, almost the conceptualization.

**Speaker B:** Conceptualization. The thoughts that we're putting down, and we're doing that by doing observational.

**Speaker A:** Thinking instead. Is one like, if we're— I'm just trying to learn more about this now, but is one more related to consciousness in terms of just an indication of the experience, and then we add a conceptualization on that experience, and then that becomes a conceptualization.

**Speaker B:** When you talk about consciousness, we have to make sure that we're talking about what kind of consciousness. Sense consciousness is what we're actually going for, is the consciousness of, in the mind moments it takes to be conscious of, some sort of input. But that input either can come from the outside input, like with the eyes and the ears and the touch and all of that with the body, the five senses, or that input can come from old garbage that's in the mind already, our memory systems from the past. The Samskara. The Samskara, precisely. Samskara will bring up constructive or discursive thoughts, just like any observation will be. And so the practice that we're talking about is to come out of those Samskara-related thoughts into the reality Because what you see with your eyes is real, right there in front of you. When you think about what you see is not real, it's conceptualizations. Yes, yes. So knowing that difference, we begin to spend more and more time in observational and less and less time in analysis.

**Speaker A:** And that would be that step after gladdening the mind, that step after generating a wholesomeness to the mind. Is that true?

**Speaker B:** That would be kind of observing the results of that, which would be satisfaction and safety and security and comfort, those.

**Speaker A:** Kind of things, as the reality, as your reality. As your reality, not as something you make up like somebody who does an affirmation like, "I'm okay." It's more like, "I am okay." Like the actual experience of being okay is your satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Because "I'm okay" doesn't believe it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right, right, right, right. Yeah, so it's coming into tune with reality, as you say, coming into tune with our actual direct experience.

**Speaker B:** Well, in this case, we're creating our reality. One created, I'm okay with a high-pitched voice, and doesn't really mean it. His reality is, I'm just saying it to get away from you. And then, I'm okay.

**Speaker A:** How different. Yeah. And it's almost like seeing reality as it is, like you were saying, I guess, you know. I mean, it's like really actually indicating that the reality is that I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** Right. And also with the knowledge that you have the power to create your own reality. This is the Samma Sanghappa, or the right attitude, is that you know that you're creating your own reality and you've got a choice about it.

**Speaker A:** Meaning that I can choose, I can follow an wholesome reality, or I can follow the wholesome reality as it.

**Speaker B:** Truly exists? Well, the distinction that we're caught on here is that the reality is not— the real reality is not a feeling. The real reality is just Thusness. Just that's how it is. But how we feel is our constructed reality. We have a choice over what kind of constructed reality that we're going to make out of the actual reality that's there.

**Speaker A:** And this is the— is it pa��a, the contact, and then the Vedana, the feeling?

**Speaker B:** Before, before, before it contacts you, what is it that contacts you? So here's the way of speaking about that, and that is, is that when we receive input from the outside, it by itself without anything else is just a data point and it doesn't mean anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** What we do with it is we take that piece of information and add it to stuff from our past in order for understanding. Understanding is perception. In other words, what we see, we don't know at all. We have to figure it out. And the way that we figure it out is either by more sense consciousness taking it in, keep looking at it. In reality, But what most people do is they see what they saw and then try to add something from their past to it to figure out what it is. Yeah. So our result, which is in the Pali, is the Salyatana, the internal representation of the external, is mired by our past. Rather than taking new data and taking new data and taking new data and taking new data would be the right way to do it. We take in data, try to figure it out based upon our past and come up with an understanding that may not fit reality very well. Let me give you an example of this. Two guys are standing on a street corner and they see somebody coming down the street dressed in a certain way. And each of these two guys that see that person dressed in that certain way have a completely different reaction to her. Yeah. Okay, now, uh, the example that I use is, is that somebody's walking down the street in a nun's habit, and one guy who got spanked by a nun when he was in school, he's going to hate her automatically. Oh, there's that old nun coming down the street, and doesn't know anything about it other than he sees the nun's habit and matches that with his past. The other guy may be in seminary and he's all Anagami about the Catholic religion and everything, and so when he sees a nun, he has great respect for her. Yeah. Now let's have a third guy who comes on the scene and he looks at what's going on and he takes another look and recognizes that this is not a nun at all. It was a Halloween costume, right? Yeah, right. But the other two guys, they put their past into it, and both of them missed. Yeah, because they weren't taking in new data and taking in more new data and taking more new data and living in reality. That, that's the— that's what we're talking about here, is that we keep adding our past into it, thinking that if we add past to the present, the result will be understanding. That's often not the case.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so those folks, those guys needed the Sati skill promoted. They needed the Sati skill to become awake, to wake up. And could we say that their application, the application of their ideas was unwholesome? And that the application of the person who was awake was wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Is that— could we say that? I would say that. Let's, instead of using the word wholesome here, let's use the word appropriate. So someone's coming down the street in a Halloween costume, it's not appropriate for somebody to come up and hit them. Also, it's not appropriate for somebody to come up to the guy in the Halloween Anicca's tomb and bow and scrape and treat them like a holy person. Both of those things are not appropriate.

**Speaker A:** I guess what I'm trying to understand is, like, when we say wholesome, are we talking about reality? Are we talking about new data? Are we talking about living in the present moment and not being completely consumed by our past, whatever the past is.

**Speaker B:** Whether it's something that was positive for us? Were consumed by their past, they were just merely, smallly influenced by the past, and they didn't recognize that they were influenced by the past. That's what's unwholesome, is that we don't know that we're making stuff up.

**Speaker A:** So the wholesome is intimately linked to Sati, intimately. You don't have a wholesome moment unless Sati is present, unless you're able to wake up and understand your direct experience.

**Speaker B:** Wake up and look at what's going on, to look at what you're doing. Look at the fact that I'm hating someone in a Halloween costume, or I'm gaga for someone wearing a Halloween costume.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I think— In fact, I never met a nun who wasn't wearing a.

**Speaker A:** Halloween costume. I think I've heard you mention in some of your talks where you indicate that, you know, that idea, that thought, that experience, that unwholesomeness is not me, you know. And I think I've also heard you talk about how, well, people will say, well, who are you? And you say, well, that's the wrong question. You know, the wrong question. But there is still that indication that you are creating kind of like a sort of a distancing, or a capacity to be aware of something that's not you, right? Whatever you are, let's not ask the wrong question, ask the right question, but there is that ability or skill to say, well, that's.

**Speaker B:** Not me. In the particular sutra where the Buddha is talking about that. He's talking about it in the sense of unwise attention. Who am I is an unwise attention. It's an unwise thought. It's unwise in the sense of what was I in the past, what will I be in the future, what I am now that will bring about that future and whatnot. The Buddha said that this is just.

**Speaker A:** A thicket of views.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. That in fact, when people ask that question, who am I, every time they ask it, it'll come up with a different answer. Yeah. Uh, one of the things that I mentioned for people to do is to sit down and list, put on a list of things who you are, and get a really good clear definition of who you are, and then do that again tomorrow. Yeah, compare those two lists and you'll see that they've changed.

**Speaker A:** You're not— yeah, you were yesterday.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, right. And so the Buddha says, what is wise attention? And what is wise attention is this is Dukkha. This is the cause of Dukkha. This is what it's like to be free from Dukkha. And this is how I get there. This is wise attention, is the Eightfold— no, excuse me, the is to see Dukkha as Dukkha, not as me.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I mean, I think if I get the terms correctly, it's the difference between what is metaphysical and what is phenomenological. It's, you know, really just the direct experience as opposed to some metaphysical experience.

**Speaker B:** Right? Exactly. Right, exactly. And in fact, in a way, you could say that metaphysical is not really the right word. And if it is, and what we can say is, is that meta in this regard, metaphysical, means outside of or above or surrounds physical. As opposed to physical, which is real. Okay, so physical is real and metaphysical is not real. Yeah, almost by that definition.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Could we say that what is unwholesome is metaphysical?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And what is physical is wholesome in a sense? I mean, is that, you know, just.

**Speaker B:** Play a word game there for a second. Tree is out there. If I'm walking towards that tree and I see that tree and I recognize that this is a physical tree, I can walk around it. Yeah. If I walk towards that tree, say this is not really a real tree, I know physical and I know metaphysics, and then I'll just run right.

**Speaker A:** Into it. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of what you say, how we just, we, you know, essentially make our— we're taught to make ourselves miserable, and we make ourselves miserable. And that is sort of a metaphysical proposition in a way, because it's not really— essentially, it's not really our real experience most of the time.

**Speaker B:** Guess what? You're right. We are taught to be miserable. Physical. We are taught to be unhappy. How does that work? We're taught that way. Well, actually, it has to do with, um, uh, scientifically, uh, we would call it imprinting. A more relaxed way of saying it, it'd be monkey see, monkey do. In other words, we learn to be miserable by being around people who are miserable. And they teach you how to be miserable. And we as children grow up around other people who are unhappy. If your dad was like a Santa Claus and ho ho ho all the time, you have a completely different life than if your dad's a wife-beater, right? Anagami and a drunk. That's the whole point, is the environment that we're living in creates a tremendous influence upon us when we're children. When are we going to stop letting the environment imprint us? When are we going to come out of our monkey see, monkey do and stop being imprinted by the unwholesome things.

**Speaker A:** That other people are doing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's the question. The answer to that is a two-step process. You got to go do it on the inside by cleaning out all of the old imprints about all the old monkey see, monkey do that we keep doing. We saw that monkey do that 30 years ago and we're still doing it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's so clear when you start looking for it, you know, just moment to moment, second to second, it's so clear. You just see these factors come up and it's like putting your hand on that stovetop and not taking it away. And then you see it like, oh shit, you know, you take— pardon my French— you know, you take it away.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, no, the issue is, is that when are you going to put your hand back on that stove because you weren't mindful, knowing that it's hot, knowing that it burns? We've been burned one time and here we are putting our hand back on that stove again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because you forget. So Sati is to remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I, you know, it's interesting. I don't know if the Buddha ever speaks to this, but I do notice that in circumstances and environments, this is easier to do, and other environments or circumstances, it becomes much more difficult. I think I've heard you address that, like when you're angry, close your mouth, don't say anything. I thought about that recently, you know, and, you know, I mean, there are certain times where I can definitely I don't really see it, but it's not necessarily like gone. And I'm just kind of going, okay, I'm in the middle of it right now. And then there are other times where I see it and it's like, wow, Mara, I see you.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** So there are kind of the more intense circumstances and less intense circumstances, my.

**Speaker B:** You know, recent experience. And when the skill builds up, that means that we're taking the intensity out of things. There's no intensity. The intensity is always added as the.

**Speaker A:** Extra feelings that we have, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** I see that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I think that obviously, you know, in my experience, as the skill develops the less impact these things have. And eventually the impact is almost unimpactful, at least to some degree. I mean, I'm not saying I'm completely there yet, but there's definitely some successes.

**Speaker B:** For sure. Well, we've been at it for about 2 hours now.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much, sir.

**Speaker B:** Good time to take a break. And yes, let's continue this at another time. Right. Be sure that you're practicing this. Be sure that you actually sit down and spend some time putting wholesome thoughts in, developing that attitude of, I can do this.

**Speaker A:** I will.

**Speaker B:** We'll see you later then.

**Speaker A:** All right. Thank you so much. Take care. I look forward to talking to you again. All right. Bye-bye. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a student (Speaker A) focuses on correcting common misunderstandings in Western Buddhism and outlining a practical, joyful path of practice. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### Core Critique: What's Missing in Western Buddhism
Dhammarato argues that Western Buddhism often misunderstands the Buddha's teachings. It's influenced by Christian ideals of suffering and salvation, leading to a somber, rigid practice focused on statuesque serenity. He points out that early Buddhist symbols were dynamic (like the Dharma wheel or Bodhi leaf), and the iconic stone Buddha statue—often without a smile—is a later Greek influence. The core element missing in the Western adaptation is **joy**.

### The Central Framework: The 4-1-3 Path to the Eightfold Path
Dhammarato presents a reinterpretation of the Noble Eightfold Path not as a linear list, but as a dynamic system:
*   **The Four "Supports" or Skills:** These are the practices that unify the mind:
    1.  **Sati (Remembering/Waking Up):** Remembering you have a choice in how you think and feel.
    2.  **Investigation (Ditti):** Honestly looking at what's happening in the present moment.
    3.  **Right Effort:** Changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones.
    4.  **Right Attitude/Intention (Samma Sankappa):** Cultivating a "leaning" or disposition of mind that is nurturing and capable, moving from a "victim" mentality to a "champion" mentality.
*   **The One Result:** **Samadhi (Unification/Wholeness):** The consistent practice of the four supports brings the mind into a unified, satisfied, and noble state.
*   **The Three Outcomes:** From this state of wholeness, three aspects of the path naturally manifest: **Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood (Sila).**
Thus, the sequence is **Pañña (wisdom/practice) -> Samadhi (wholeness) -> Sila (ethical conduct)**, which is often taught backwards.

### Key Practice: Working with Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts
*   **The Goal:** To "gladden the mind" and cultivate *sukkha* (satisfaction/happiness), not to grimly endure *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction).
*   **Unwholesome Thoughts:** Anything that prevents you from feeling the peace and satisfaction you want. They are often based on the past/future, cravings, "what-if-isms," delusion, and metaphysical stories we tell ourselves. They are like putting your hand on a hot stove.
*   **Wholesome Thoughts:** Thoughts that align with present-moment reality and generate satisfaction. They are about what is actually true and good *right now* (e.g., "I am safe," "I am breathing," "This is good enough").
*   **The Method:** The moment you notice an unwholesome thought (Sati), investigate it, make the effort to change it to a wholesome one, and then **congratulate yourself** (nurturing attitude). This repetitive process soaks the mind in wholesomeness, like water slowly saturating a sponge.

### Important Clarifications and Analogies
*   **Not Suppression, but Replacement:** You don't suppress unwholesome thoughts; you recognize they are passing phenomena and replace them.
*   **Attitude is Key:** Shifting from a critical, rule-bound "victim" mindset to a nurturing, "I-can-handle-anything" champion's mindset is essential.
*   **Ethics as a Result, Not a Rule:** Precepts (non-harming, etc.) are the natural outcome of a satisfied, unified mind, not arbitrary rules to follow.
*   **The Brahma-Viharas as Outcomes:** Loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity arise naturally from a gladdened mind. True compassion means helping others become happy without joining their "pity party."
*   **Training the Mind:** The mind is trained like a wild horse: first fence it in the "pasture" of wholesome thoughts, then refine it in the "corral" of a mantra or focused rhythm, eventually leading to the "stall" of deep stillness. Stopping discursive thought is an advanced skill built on this foundation.
*   **Reality vs. Affirmation:** Wholesome thinking is not empty affirmation ("I'm beautiful" when you don't believe it). It's aligning with the actual, available reality of the present moment ("I am okay right now").

### Conclusion: A Path of Joy and Empowerment
The talk emphasizes that the Buddha's path is about taking responsibility for your own mind and happiness. It's a practical, repeatable process of waking up, choosing wholesome thoughts, and cultivating an attitude of joyful capability. This leads to a unified mind from which ethical living and genuine spiritual qualities flow naturally. The ultimate goal is to "gladden the mind" and realize you have the power to create a satisfying reality here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories used by Speaker B (Dhammarato) are:

### **Core Metaphors:**

1.  **The Jigsaw Puzzle:** Used to describe the state of Western Buddhism.
    *   **The Problem:** The puzzle is incomplete (missing pieces like "joy") and practitioners don't have a clear picture of what they're trying to build (the true goal is obscured by Christian-influenced expectations).
    *   **The Implication:** The teachings are a complete system; if parts are missing or the goal is misunderstood, you can't achieve the intended result.

2.  **The Deck of Cards:** A simpler version of the puzzle metaphor.
    *   **The Problem:** If cards are missing, you can't play the game properly, but people try anyway without knowing which cards are gone.
    *   **The Implication:** Western Buddhism is operating with an incomplete set of the Buddha's teachings.

3.  **The Sponge (or Towel):** Illustrates how the mind absorbs training through repetition.
    *   **The Process:** At first, the mind (like a dry sponge) resists wholesome thoughts. Through persistent, repeated practice ("dropping water on it"), it begins to absorb and change.
    *   **The Implication:** Consistent effort is required for the "attitude" of mastery to soak in.

4.  **The Leaning Tree:** Explains the concept of **Samma Sankappa (Right Intention/Attitude)**.
    *   **The Image:** A tree will fall in the direction it leans. The mind, through its habitual "leanings" (attitudes), will fall into certain patterns of thought.
    *   **The Practice:** By repeatedly choosing wholesome thoughts, we change the mind's "lean" from victimhood ("I can't") to championship ("I can handle anything").

5.  **The Wild vs. Trained Horse:** Describes the process of training the mind.
    *   **The Stages:**
        *   **Wild Stallion:** The untrained, discursive mind roaming everywhere.
        *   **Pasture:** Establishing boundaries with only wholesome thoughts.
        *   **Corral:** Focusing the mind further, like on a chant or song.
        *   **Stall:** High concentration, like a mantra or the breath.
    *   **The Implication:** You must gradually train and focus the mind; you can't just order a wild horse to be still.

6.  **The Doctor and the Brahma-Viharas:** Reinterprets the "divine abodes."
    *   **Loving-Kindness (Metta):** The doctor's desire to help.
    *   **Compassion (Karuna):** Not catching the patient's "disease" (misery/anger) but staying healthy to help.
    *   **Sympathetic Joy (Mudita):** Offering the real cure—joy and a better perspective.
    *   **Equanimity (Upekkha):** Having the "sea legs" to handle loss and failure without burnout, like a sea captain in a storm or a doctor who loses patients.

7.  **The Sea Captain vs. The Landlubber:** A specific story for **Upekkha (Equanimity)**.
    *   **The Scene:** On a ship in high seas.
    *   **The Landlubber:** Loses balance, clutches for ropes, gets sick—buffeted by circumstances.
    *   **The Sea Captain:** Has "sea legs"—maintains dynamic balance and can move with the ship's motion.
    *   **The Implication:** Equanimity is a skill that allows you to handle life's inevitable ups and downs without being knocked over.

### **Key Stories & Analogies:**

1.  **The Buddha Statue History:** A historical account to correct a misconception.
    *   **The Point:** The iconic stone sitting Buddha is a later Greek-influenced addition. Early symbols were the wheel, the Bodhi leaf, and an *empty seat* under the tree. The key missing element in Western imitations is **the slight smile**—the joy.

2.  **The Angulimala Story ("Stop"):** Referenced by Speaker A.
    *   **The Point:** The serial killer Angulimala is stopped when the Buddha simply says, "I have stopped. Now you stop." It illustrates the instantaneous power of choosing to stop unwholesome action.

3.  **The Kosher Butcher and the Smiling Goat:** An analogy for the precepts arising naturally from a wholesome mind.
    *   **The Scene:** A rabbi about to ritually slaughter a goat sees it smiling at him.
    *   **The Point:** A mind that becomes "noble" and unified spontaneously rejects killing. The precepts are an outcome, not an arbitrary set of rules to follow. You can't kill the smiling goat because your mind has changed.

4.  **The Two Darts:** Referenced in the discussion of the Second Noble Truth.
    *   **The First Dart:** The physical or initial pain (e.g., being shot, a criticism).
    *   **The Second Dart:** The mental suffering we add ourselves—the resentment, the story, the "I don't like this."
    *   **The Point:** We are responsible for the "second dart." The practice is about learning not to throw it.

5.  **The Nun in a Halloween Costume:** An example of perception vs. reality.
    *   **The Scene:** Three people see someone in a nun's habit.
    *   **The Reactions:** One hates her (bad past experience), one reveres her (religious devotion), one sees it's just a costume.
    *   **The Point:** We constantly filter present-moment reality through past impressions (Samskara). Wholesome practice is about seeing **new data** clearly, not layering old stories onto it.

### **Overarching Themes of the Metaphors:**
*   **Completeness vs. Fragmentation:** The puzzle and deck of cards emphasize that the true Dhamma is a complete, systematic path.
*   **Active Training vs. Passive Statuary:** The horse training and sponge metaphors contrast with the mistaken ideal of the stone-faced, static Buddha. Practice is dynamic, repetitive training.
*   **Internal Change Precedes External Action:** The smiling goat and precepts show that ethical behavior flows naturally from a satisfied, unified mind, not from rule-following.
*   **Joy as the Center:** The missing smile on the statue and the missing "joy" piece of the puzzle highlight that Sukkha (satisfaction/joy) is not a byproduct but a central ingredient and indicator of correct practice.
*   **From Victim to Champion:** The leaning tree and general discourse frame the entire path as a shift in attitude from passive victimhood to active mastery of one's own mind.
