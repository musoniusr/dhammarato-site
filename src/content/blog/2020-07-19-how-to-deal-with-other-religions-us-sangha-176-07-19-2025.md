### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This is Saturday morning at 9 o'clock Thai time. It's Friday evening in the US. And so today you should talk about how to deal with other religions, like mostly Christianity, but you can use this for all the religions, uh, and just a matter of changing the language. And so, um, this— the idea of this came from something that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said, um, and he said it often enough that he actually meant it. And the strange thing is, and this is actually pretty strange, he said that there is no reason for anyone to join another religion, that the religion that they were born into is just fine. They can do any and everything that you can do with any religion that you can do with Buddhism. I'm not sure that he said that. But he said it in the sense that there was no reason for anyone to change their religion. And that I kind of put that aside because he had said that many years ago and that It looks like that mostly Christianity has been really evolving, going in the wrong direction, so that it's very difficult for anyone to, um, let us say, gain good value and have great benefit from the religion that they're in. Uh, then, uh, a couple of weeks ago I saw a video on YouTube that sparked my interest in this. And what the video pointed out was, is that Buddhism has always worked the same way. And, uh, that way is, is that it goes into a new country or a new area that has some religion or another and doesn't try to change that religion, but rather adds the Buddhist teaching to it. Possibly the most striking example of that is in Japan, where there are temples that have, uh, let us say, uh, two different sections. One would be Shinto and the other one would be Zen, but it's the same building with no doors between it. It was just like on this section of the hall is Shinto and that section is, um, is in. We can also see that that's basically what happened in Tibet, that Tibetan culture has not changed much by Buddhism, that in fact many people find it even hard to find Buddhism. All they find is the Tibetan religion, but the robes and a few things are there. Teachings that show that it's actually also Buddhist. We can see that in other places. In Thailand, the old animistic religion— I'm not even sure I know the name of it— is still practiced here in Thailand. But in fact, one of the things that I had learned was that the Thais don't make much of any distinction. There are two places. One is in Bangkok. One is called Arahant. And then on Silom Road, there is a huge Hindu shrine. And on the normal Buddha days, that place will be packed with people from Bangkok. And in fact, they'll go from one from a Buddhist temple to a Hindu temple and then to Arahant, which is a ceremonial dance setting from the old religion. And they don't make much to it to where Buddhism, if it is going to come into the West, It looks like that it is coming in as its own thing, or it's coming in as a Western Buddhism that really doesn't have much of anything that looks like the actual teachings of the Buddha. They call it Vipassana, they call it mindfulness meditation. But it's basically part of psychology, not as part of the religion. And that there's another point about Christianity is that Christianity has gone through quite a lot of changes, especially in the United States. But from what I've heard, the attendance which is a criteria for a religion, the attendance in Great Britain is down to about 4%. The attendance in various European countries is down to like 10%, and that's also true in Canada and the northern United States, to where Christianity is still kind of active in the southern part of the United States. Now, when I was a child, Christianity was much more of a religion with all of the features and aspects of a religion, to where now Christianity looks much more like a cult. And I make that distinction in the sense that it's become highly politicized, and one of the hallmarks of modern Christianity, especially evangelical Christianity, is that it has not just become political, but it's also angry. They have a grief or a beef that they have about the rest of the world and that they're politically motivated to fix the world. And so they've gotten a lot of legislation passed, and also they're quite unhappy about some legislation that has passed, and they have become quite anti— well, there's three main things. They're anti- abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-immigration. Much of what you find in Christianity, in fact, has got very little or nothing to do with what Jesus taught. Then, in fact, we could go so far as to say that there is a duality. And that in Christianity, when I was a child, I saw cartoons. I don't think that I ever saw that much in church, but the cartoons would have an angel on one shoulder and a little devil on the other shoulder, and that the cartoon character that had the angel and the devil would listen to one and then listen to the other. And get all confused. And you could say that that's basically how we all are, and that that duality would be— also could be named as our instincts and our wisdom. The instincts being the devil, and the angel would be then our wisdom. And we see that duality in all of us, that in fact this is what we have within Buddhism, is to teach, to listen to the thoughts that we have and see them as wholesome or unwholesome. And that then can be put into that context of, is this thought instinctual or is it wise? You can also put it in that context of, is this the devil in me talking, or is this, uh, the angel in me talking? So with, with that, we can see that, um, what we've been doing is we've been practicing going for the wholesome. We have been practicing not listening to our instincts, our greed, our anger, our ill will, and the ignorance that's associated with that, and listening to our higher nature for wholesomeness. And this is the secret of the teaching of the Buddha, is to be able to identify what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, and then make a change to that. Well, if you think about it, Christianity kind of has that idea built in. It's just that nobody's paying much attention to it anymore. So the first thing that I'd like to point out is that everyone who comes to Buddhism generally comes from some other place Mostly Westerners are coming from Christianity, and as we do, we bring quite a lot of baggage with us. Mikey has said that he wasn't much of a Christian when he was a kid, even though he was in Oklahoma. But he also recognizes that there was a lot of baggage that he picked up, even if he didn't go to church much. So I'd like to ask here in the group, is there anyone here who considers themselves, let us say, at least a little bit or partly Christian and also Buddhist at the same time? All right, Anna, yes. Okay, how about Potato? RJ, how about you?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm actually not Christian. I'm a Jain, but I'm not much religious. But yeah, you could say I'm a little bit of Jain. And yeah, and I'm also doing, you know, what you've been teaching if that is Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** So, um, if we are going to be taking Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's idea that people should not in fact convert from one religion to another, and we also already have the concept of that within Buddhism we don't actually proselytize or try to convert someone into Buddhism. So the question would be, how do we deal with Christians? I imagine Anna deals with Christians on a regular basis. She's in New York. I've seen Shepherd, in fact, talk about Christianity even though he's in Thailand. RJ, do you see Christians or are around them at all?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a lot of Christians around me, but we generally don't talk about the religion.

**Speaker A:** Okay. How about you, Ben?

**Speaker C:** There are a lot of Catholic churches around here in Vietnam. I think Catholicism is pretty big. I mean, yeah, but the main religion is like the ancestor worship, the traditional system. Yeah, but again, I don't— there's no sort of— I don't see many people who are sort of outwardly Christian, or the government doesn't allow things like street preaching and that, I don't think.

**Speaker A:** So it may be then that today's talk is not very much for the people who are online here, but it might be of some value to those who are hearing this recording who do deal with Christians. And so the first thing that I would have to say about it is that it's best to not argue with them. We know that almost everything that a Christian will have to say about Christianity is bullshit. They're taught the bullshit. That in fact, the best parts of Christianity is polluted by the bullshit. Let us say that in the context of the duality within Christianity, You have, one, the teachings of Jesus, and two, you have Christianity. Christianity, in fact, has lost most of the teachings of Jesus. And so we can, in fact, if we talk to Christians, we can talk to them not about Christianity and all of the stuff that it has, but rather talk about Jesus. Now, an example of something to not bother to talk about is the divinity of Jesus and the hallmark of dying for our sins and then being resurrected. Now, the first thing that comes to my mind, that I've had this idea for gosh, so many years. Maybe you've thought about it too, but that if he died for our sins and then was resurrected, doesn't— didn't that dying for our sins get kind of undone? And he didn't die for our sins at all because he was resurrected. But there's something more important with that, and that is, is that Throughout the teachings of Jesus, there were 3 or 4 places where he actually forgave someone of their sin without the death. In fact, while he was on the cross, he forgave the sins of one of the other 2 criminals that were being crucified with him even before he died. So this is an important point that we can say is that Jesus, or in fact whoever says it, can in fact forgive you of your sin. That we don't need to have Jesus to die on the cross to forgive you for your sins. You can become forgiven without that. Another point which is really, really valuable In the Book of John, it says that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth him shall have everlasting life. I think that's the way that it goes. But the point is, is that in this context, it says that God loves you. Well, God's a pretty big thing to them, you know. Really, really big deal, God. So if God loves you, that means that you probably got all the love that you could use. Sort of like an ocean of love, or a bathtub, or a swimming pool full. That is not a teacup. That is, you've got a huge amount of love. If God loves you, you don't even need any more love than that. You've got quite enough. So from those two positions, that God loves you and that the position is, is that you can be forgiven for your sins. In fact, one of the other places where he was dealing with a girl who was getting stoned for prostitution, and he said whoever is free from sin can cast the first stone, and nobody did that. So, um, as, as the end of the conversation, he says, uh, go and sin no more. So we've got basically all we need to do to, to teach the teachings of, um, the Buddha within the context of Christianity. We don't have to use Buddhist terms in order to get the very basics of Buddhism working for a Christian. So if you're going to be in a conversation with a Christian, you can actually teach them the teachings of the Buddha, but we can do that totally within the context and the confines of Christian language. If we can do that, then we can actually help someone to come out of their primary mode of operation. And the primary mode of operation for Christians is, one, they're angry. Number two, they are afraid. They're afraid of going to hell. If God loves you, then you don't have to worry about going to hell. Number 3 is guilt for sin, original guilt. And, um, then, uh, we could say that the, uh, I think there was 4, um, fear, guilt, uh, anger, and, oh, having a lot of work to do, like proselytizing, that they've got to go out and get other people to convert to their system because that's where they get their benefit. But if they would stay with just what Jesus taught, that there would be enough there that they could start to practice the teachings of the Buddha without using any Buddhist language at all. Now, one of the things that Jesus did say would be, behold, the kingdom of God is at hand, which means it's all around you, it's right here, you can grasp it with your hand. But he also said in Luke 17, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. Now, this word kingdom actually in the Greek is the word basileka. Now, basilica is like a great big church. It's a cathedral. In fact, only the biggest cathedrals are called a basilica. And that you've got that kind of— even the Christians in fact say that your body is the temple of God. Well, if the body is the temple of God, That means that every breath you take, you're breathing in God, because behold, the kingdom of God is right here. It's all around us, it's inside of us, etc. So if we can talk about it from that perspective, we don't need to get into the Christian story. Then in fact, it's quite possible to practice the the teachings of Jesus without even using the word— excuse me, teaching within Buddhism the teachings of the Buddha without ever mentioning the Buddha's name or tell any stories about his birth, about his lessons that he had. All we need to teach is how to practice well. We can teach people how to practice what Jesus taught within that context of what the Buddha taught without ever using any Buddhist terminology or language. And if there was enough people who could hear this and start to practice, then the Buddhist language could be introduced. And as it is introduced, that would mean then that Buddhism would be seen as part of Christianity, just like in India Buddhism is part of Hinduism, that in Tibet Buddhism is a part of the Tibetan, and in Japan, excuse me, the Shinto religion and Buddhism are combined with one another. In fact, this is one of the things that has greatly confused a lot of Westerners because they think that Buddhism should be kept separate, that in fact it is only a religion because people wanted to make it a religion. But in fact the actual teachings of the Buddha don't need to be associated with any religion at all. That in fact, uh, the teachings of the Buddha, the correct teachings, would work within the context of any of the religion. I assume even Islam has enough. They talk about the mercy of Allah. That's the starting point right there. If Allah gives you mercy, then what else do you need? Just like in Christianity, they say that God's got a plan. Well, if God's got a plan, who needs any other plans? That's a plan enough. We could say that maybe we can have a little plan here and there, but the big plan is already done, so we don't have to do any planning anymore. We can just let God do it. And so a lot of the stuff that we would practice that would be considered correctly practicing the teachings of the Buddha is already built right into Christianity. It's already there. They just don't practice it because they don't even understand the concept of practice. That in fact, there's very little in the Bible that actually talks about correct practice. But there is one place, and that is in the Garden of Gethsemane, when Jesus is sitting up, he says that he's watching. Now, that's a word that is translated out of the Greek, but what it actually means should be the same thing as right noble view, is to watch to look at how you feel, to pay attention to what's going on. And so he actually had a practice. It's just that it wasn't actually introduced very well. He wasn't actually teaching long enough to, uh, to really get the point across. And the point is, is that we must practice to, uh, this this duality so that we stop listening to our lower nature, we stop listening to our instincts, and we start listening to the higher part within our own mind. That every one of us has that double, and every one of us has that angel sitting on our shoulder, and that all we need to do is to practice to not listen to that instinctual stuff and start listening to our wisdom. But that takes practice because we've been practicing our whole lives to listen to the devil within us. Now, Jesus also said, uh, get behind me, Satan. What that means is, is to leave all of our lower nature in the past. And we can go and live our lives and sin no more. We can in fact practice correctly, and with that correct practice, we can gain the benefit of Christianity, or gain the benefit— now, most of what Christianity is doing is that it's all wrapped up in deep dark past and deep dark future. The Hindus are even more wrapped up in deep dark past because they've got eons and eons in the past, to where Christianity only has a couple thousand years. They say that Jesus was coming back, but Jesus says that people who were standing right in front of me, my disciples, will still be alive when I come back. Which means then that because they've all died and it's been all this time, that Jesus isn't coming back. What needs to come back is our mind to keep coming back and coming back and coming back into the present moment. So this is a concept out of Buddhism that we can in fact teach to the Christians, and that is the quality of be here now, that God is here now, God is around you right now. We can take a deep breath and breathe in God and breathe out God. We can be in the present moment and be just fine. It's when we get all hung up about the second coming or what happened a long time ago that actually is a part of that lower nature, caring about things that we have no control over at all. But in fact, we have no control over the future, we have no control over the past. But what we can have control over is how we feel and what we're thinking right now. And so this would be the way to deal with Christians because it's actually not a good idea to get into conversation with them about their story. The story of Jesus is irrelevant, but the practice of what Jesus said to say, that's relevant. It's relevant for Christians now, and it's relevant for the teachings of the Buddha right now. So this would be the way to handle them. And you can imagine that from time to time Christians are going to come and proselytize to you to get you to join their religion. In fact, I saw one video about it that this young man was at some sort of revival or festival or something, and some Christians came up to him and buttered him up and talked to him about it and asked him about his past. And he says, oh, well, I'm enrolling in seminary and I'm going to become a preacher. As soon as they heard that, they lost all their interest in him completely. They weren't interested in teaching or becoming friends with him. They were interested in saving souls. And yet none of the Christians that I know were saved from their sin. Every one of them continued to sin. Every one of them. They still get angry. In fact, anger seems to be a big part of their religion, to be angry at the LGBTQ, to be angry at women who have abortions, to be angry at everybody who gets a divorce. They've got these rules, you know. And so what we can teach them is, is that, um, the teachings of Jesus is not about making other people abide by your rules. The teachings of Jesus is, can you be in heaven right now? Can you be in the kingdom of God right now? Can you take a breath? Can you be here now? Can you be in paradise? Can you stop your judgment about other people? It's kind of funny, in fact, that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did read the Book of Genesis and some other stuff in Christianity, and he read it without having Christian influence. So he could see that the teachings in the Book of Genesis was about Adam and Eve. Really was not about magical talking snakes. It wasn't about the woman made the man do it, that the woman is evil. It wasn't about that God threw them out of paradise. And in fact, it's kind of funny that God would put a tree in paradise just to tempt them and say that you can't eat the fruit of this tree. Well, if they can't eat the fruit of this tree, then why did God put that tree in the Garden of Eden anyway? That's like telling a teenager he can't drink. If you tell a teenager he can't drink, he can't use alcohol, what's he wanting to do? It's forbidden. The forbidden fruit is always inviting. Oh, if it's forbidden, that means that I'll be better off if I did have it. So the whole story that Christianity teaches about Adam and Eve is part of the Christian ethos. It's not actually wisdom talking. But if you see the wisdom in it, then you can see that Adam and Eve actually ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. Wasn't even a tree at all. They ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. What does that mean? It means that they had the knowledge of what is good and what is bad. And here you have Christianity going around pointing fingers, this is good and this is bad, and this is good and this is bad, to where what Jesus was teaching was about accepting that things are just as they are, that you've already got the kingdom of heaven, that you've already got the love of God. What else do you need? This is good enough. And so this is the way we can talk to Christians, is about that their religion already teaches them that everything is good enough. All they have to do is to remember to practice that. And memory— there's the concept of uh, drinking the wine and, and chewing the wafer, uh, do this in remembrance of me. What I would say is, is that in order for the Christian to remember Jesus would be to remember that you're already, uh, loved by God, that you're already in the presence of God right now. All you have to do is to change your evil thoughts into wholesome thoughts. So this is basically all there is to it. We can take this concept that I've just given you and work with any religion, because every religion has something of value in it that can be put into the perspective of practice. That really, that's the concept that's really missing within Christianity, that all the good parts are there, except— and this is what we find is incorrect within the Western Buddhism— it's all the same in the sense that they practice, but they're not practicing correctly, because the real practice is not just seeing the unwholesome devilish thoughts, but to change them into the happy, wholesome, um, uh, angelic thoughts. That everyone is an angel when they practice being the angel that they have within themselves. Everybody here is an angel when you're practicing being an angel, and when you're not, you're going to fall back into being the same old devil that you've always been. Which is the one who is judging things that are good and bad. So we can take that then and understand, well, we now actually have the teachings of the Buddha that's much more complete, but we can give the very basics to anyone. They don't— we don't have to get them to change their religion. We don't have to mention Buddhism anywhere. We can just start talking about be happy. God loves you right now. There's nothing else you need to do. You're already okay right now. Let's finish that off with— that's actually the— yeah, does that relate to the Zen Buddhism notion of instant enlightenment? You said like a bunch of episodes ago like go back to the instant enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** It's just that's, that's, that's what you need. Is that, is that it?

**Speaker A:** Yes. In fact, if you look at the word enlightenment, isn't it— it's got two qualities to it. One is you can see the light, daylight, shine a light on it, which means to look, to witness, behold, see. Or as the Buddha's language would be, Right Noble Viewing, to look at what you're doing, to look at the thoughts that you have. And so the second part of it then would be, once we see the devil on our shoulder, let's drop that and become lightweight. So enlightenment is nothing but seeing what needs to be done and doing it. And the doing it is almost always stop to stop doing it, to stop listening to the devil and to start listening to the angelical. So that's what real enlightenment is, even though the word enlightenment is no place in, uh, the context of the teachings of the Buddha. The word enlightenment never appears anywhere. That what the Buddha used was the word bodhi, which is often mistranslated as enlightenment. And the word Bodhi actually means to wake up, which actually also has the quality of shining a light on it. Look at what you're doing. And the one, uh, the Bodhi who is awake means that he is wise to, um, that devil. That in fact, that's the funny thing, that, uh, there is the concept of Mara The fact that Buddha talked about Mara even after he was enlightened, he would say, aha, I see you, Mara, which would be in Christian language, aha, I see you, devil, I see you trying to get me to, uh, uh, start to be angry and hateful and, um, feel guilty about my sin. And, uh, and start to feel afraid of going to hell and all of that kind of stuff. And so in fact, all the normal people have all of the same stuff going on, and that there is a cure for that. And the cure is in fact lightening up, looking at what we're doing, and then dropping that lower nature. It's actually quite easy to do. It's an actual easy practice because all we have to do is to stop listening to our anger, our greed, our frustration, our doubt, our worry, and just be happy. In fact, that's one of the things that you could say that Christianity in a way has an advantage over Buddhism, because they've got that concept of God loves you. Hey man, if God loves me, I've got it made. I don't need anything else. I've got all the love I need. I don't have to get the love from family or friends or one of the girls or the chicks or anything. I've already got everything I need.. And so this is all there really is to it. So Ivan, what do you have to say about this?

**Speaker B:** I posted a Bible verse. I think it's— he said like, everything exposed by the light is made visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes light.

**Speaker D:** Itself.

**Speaker B:** I feel like kind of— I feel like it kind of ties to what you were.

**Speaker A:** Saying. Someone else was talking? Oh, no, I was just agreeing with that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the light that shines through. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So, Anna, what do you have to say about.

**Speaker E:** This?

**Speaker F:** When I was educated myself about Christianity, I only read Gospels, so it was kind of fun, but everything else was annoying and pretentious. So like, the life of Jesus was pretty cute. Everything else was like too much politics in it and nothing.

**Speaker A:** Else.

**Speaker F:** So that's what I have to say.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Mikey, can you help me with understanding what Anna said?

**Speaker D:** She was basically saying she was more into the Gospels and the story of Jesus. She thought it was pretty cute. Was that correct, Anna?

**Speaker F:** I'm not in anything. I just, if I have to say something about Christianity, I would say Gospels sounds kind of cute. Everything else is annoying.

**Speaker A:** Politics.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the rest is just annoying.

**Speaker A:** Politics. Well, if you live in Thailand, you know that Buddhism is full of politics too, and Tibetan is really full of politics. Wow, with the Chinese government and all of that kind of stuff. And so, uh, ordinary people within any religion is going to be politically minded until they look and see that their politically-mindedness is Dukkha, it's disappointing, it is unwholesome, unhealthy, and that they can stop it and stop being political and then be happy. Don't worry, be happy. We don't need the politics. In fact, you could say that that's the biggest problem with Christianity, is it's become way, way too political. And in the process of becoming political, it's also become painful. They become angry. They're trying to force their beliefs on other people. So RJ, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that is true very commonly. Like, people I mean, it's not just Christianity. Are you able to hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, in my religion, in Jainism also, it's like that. So even though there are some very good things in Jainism, but people who are very religious, they tend to do more rituals and things, kind of more You know, whatever they can do with money or, you know, with their body, like sitting and doing a lot of prayers. So not in their inside they would do anything, but all the external things like hard work or, you know, a lot of fasting, a lot of praying, going to temples, to faraway places, all that they will do because it's kind of easier. Also, it's in a way similar to how you perform in corporate or outer world to do great. So, they do all that, but they are not that happy. And it's hard to change them. Like you have said earlier that we should teach only people who are seeking this. If we start telling this to people who have completely closed their eyes, they won't see anyways. So in a way, all religions are same in that manner.

**Speaker A:** You can tell that people will in fact listen, that you can in fact be happy, if you can tell people that, hey man, God loves you. What else do you need? And then they'll start talking about all kinds of belief systems that they have. You know that they're not going to listen to you. But, and so there's no reason to talk. But if they do listen to you, yeah, you're right, all I need is the love of God. And guess what? I've got all of that I need. I got plenty of it. I don't have to plan. God's got a plan. So if they start to agree with you, then that means then that they can actually start practicing their religion correctly and gain some great value from it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and that also happens with some people I see, like me included. I'm also slowly getting it. I see benefits, so I keep doing it more. And people surrounding me, they also, you know, naturally I tell them sometimes. And some of them, you know, try it for a little bit of time and they see benefit, but then they don't have Sati.

**Speaker A:** So they don't remember exactly. They don't have the Sati. So that's the whole point, is that we have to remember that we've got unwholesome thoughts that we can eliminate. We can stop that. We can actually become little angels. You can become happy angels, but we have to practice becoming happy angels.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, first thing is this very powerful statement. Most of the people around me, like, they won't understand it because it's too simple and too much we are getting. So it's like almost impossible to them. And some people, when they try, they see it and then they forget. So, and a lot of people, they don't want to see because it's breaking a lot of the concepts that they have already, like especially people who have been working really hard. Let's say they are praying 10 hours, 8 hours a day, and if I tell them this, it's like taking away all their effort. So they don't want to see. So there's many different.

**Speaker A:** Cases. All right. In fact, we could go— Ivan had mentioned something. That we can also teach them about prayer in the sense of stop asking God for things and start having a prayer of thanksgiving. Thank you, God, for giving us all this wonderful stuff. Wow, I've got breath. I could breathe you in and breathe you out all day long. Oh, what a nice thing it is. So you can actually introduce gratitude as prayer rather than wanting something. Uh, George Garland had the, uh, the idea of prayer. Well, God's got a plan. You're trying to get God to change his plan? He's had that plan for eons. He knows what he's doing, and here you are wanting him to change it just for you. Little old you, you want him to change his plan. Actually What we need to do is to thank God for taking care of us. Yeah, that's the way to pray, is to pray with thanksgiving. Wow, this is so.

**Speaker B:** Great. Yeah, that is so true. My wife prays sometimes, and, you know, based on our talks, so I told her in a similar manner that when you're praying, you're actually being happy at that time. So it's great. And that also kind of, in a way, she's in a better state at that time versus being more like— I tried to tell her, you don't have to do it, you know, by hour or measuring that I have to pray so much. So whenever you're praying and if you're happy at that time, then that's the right way. You can do less also. And I think she's doing like.

**Speaker A:** That. Harold, what do you think?

**Speaker G:** So it was up to.

**Speaker A:** Me?

**Speaker G:** I'm more on the technical side of things. So what I'm thinking is when, because I've heard practitioners say, or sorry, Christians Christian practitioners say, you know, they have a relationship with God. And when you ask what that means is that they talk to God. So I'm like, oh, okay. So they are speaking to themselves in a positive, wholesome manner. They're not— they're practicing mindfulness or Sati. As they're speaking to whoever, to themselves, but by paying attention to their speaking, right, they feel better and they like, you know, build up towards the first Jhana. So if I was a Christian practitioner and I accidentally entered the first Jhana by just speaking nicely to myself for a few days, it would be hard not to believe in, you know, the magic of the words or the magic of the religion. And you mentioned, you know, we're talking about light and radiance, which reminds me of the fourth Jhana. I was looking it up again, what the Buddha said in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta in the DN 22, and it says just as if a person were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth, so too he sits pervading this very body with the purity of a bright mind, so that there's no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the purity of a bright mind. If I didn't know what any of that was and I practiced Christianity and somehow, you know, like the mystics that write this stuff enter the fourth jhana of pure radiance, it would reinforce my belief in religion. But the nice thing about the suttas is, oh no, these are technicalities. This is like, here's the practice, here's how you do it. You can be thinking about good bananas and still get to the same level of the jhanas.

**Speaker A:** So yes, that's exactly right. So we can talk about it in the sense of, uh, that the body becomes the temple of God. It becomes a basilica. It becomes a cathedral. Beautiful, shimmering, bright. And so, uh, actually we've got many of the analogies, uh, from, uh, Buddhism, uh, that fit directly with Christianity if we take it in the context of being grateful to God for our prayers. Now, they talk about having a relationship with God, but the relationship is almost always the relationship of God loves me, therefore, like a sugar daddy, he's going to give me everything that I want and desire. And so it doesn't really work that way, but keeps us in a state of greed. But if we can change that idea of prayer into being grateful for all the stuff that I've already got, be happy the way things really are, that's the way that Christianity actually can benefit people.

**Speaker E:** Uh, hello Dhammarato, can I ask you a question that— yeah, about this, like, okay. Uh, well, yesterday I think I learned something new with talk with Bhikkhu yesterday. We were talking about how, like, it's kind of hard for me to understand Anapanasati Because like, oh, I know I have to sit down, I have to see the unwholesome thought, I have to catch the wholesome thought. But I feel like it's easier for me to see that, hey, the feeling is different from normal people, is different from being a headless chicken. It's like the quality of the emotion on on Anapanasati, it's like being content, like this is good enough, being content, right? Am I understanding this correctly?

**Speaker A:** Sure. Yes. That's part of the practice is becoming content, becoming at peace, becoming already okay.

**Speaker E:** So, yeah.

**Speaker A:** We don't need to practice that because we've already been practicing way too much. Of being unhappy, of being in the state of need of something, out chasing things, and not being at peace. So that's actually one of the ways of— if I can change the subject just a little bit— they say that Islam is a religion of peace. Well, if it is, then why aren't the Muslims, each one of them on their own at peace? Can they practice being at peace? Can you practice? Because we are already well skilled at being unhappy, being in a state of need. Let's practice being in a state of everything is already okay. You've got your breath. Take a good breath. Oh wow, God's in that breath. Let me breathe in God.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, like, if there's something more you can explain about practice Anapanasati, because like knowing more can help me.

**Speaker A:** There's no more to it. That's enough already right then and there. You just start practicing.

**Speaker D:** That.

**Speaker A:** Okay, more will come later, but let's go first. That's like the piano student asking the piano teacher, okay, you've taught me Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, is there more? The answer is yes. The more is practice Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and when you get good at it, we'll give you another song to sing or to play.

**Speaker E:** Let's see. Well, in the talk with the Anicca last night, we actually talked about like there is certain kind of the thought in the Christianity that also make them like feel in the good enough state. Like God loves you, like God is taking care of you, no need to think about future or past.

**Speaker A:** That's also like, right, you're okay right now. Everything is.

**Speaker E:** Fine. Yeah, like, like, God loves you. It's like, it's actually one of the thinking about that. Like, it makes you feel like good enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes, practice feeling good enough because we can talk about it here and you and I can talk about it right now. And 5 minutes after the talk is finished, you're back into feeling you're not good enough again. So you have to keep practicing. You have to remember to practice that your little angel inside, and when that devil comes to tempt you, you can say, I don't have to listen to that part of me, I can listen to the better.

**Speaker E:** Part. Okay, I see. Thank you so.

**Speaker A:** Much. So Christine, CV, what do you got to say?

**Speaker H:** So I reconciled a couple years ago that my name Christina means follower of Christ. And what I think about that is I believe that he was alive, but the story that man has made up about his teachings, I struggle with. The main struggle I have is about heaven and is about doing good to get something just doesn't feel good. It feels very transactional.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But what we've been talking about then, let's change the word from Basilica into heaven. We can change the word Kingdom of God into heaven right now, you've got heaven. All you, you, yeah, you're in heaven. All you have to do is remember that this is heavenly.

**Speaker B:** This is good.

**Speaker H:** Enough. Right. It also, it feels like, you know, with sort of like disrespect for the current moment, if you're thinking like the future is gonna be better or there's something better, that you're not really like enjoying and having respect for the moment that you have here. So I've learned to kind of reconcile that. What I took from today's talk, which was interesting, and I wrestled with it at first, was instinct being the devil and wisdom being the angel. Because we always hear like, trust your instinct. And that's not what we're saying. You can feel your instinct, and then you can use wisdom to see what's what's really going on. So I thought that was really impactful for me tonight.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. I'm glad that you got that out of it. Yes. So let's see who's next. Vlad Oakland, what do you have to.

**Speaker E:** Say?

**Speaker A:** I don't have too much to say about it. I pretty much avoid ultra-religious people, and there are a lot near me. But I just didn't want to leave your talk. Well, if you get into one of those unavoidable situations, now you've got something to say to them. Then in fact, you could boil it down to just 3 words: don't worry, be happy. Well, that's 4. Don't worry, be happy. God loves you. That's down to 3. That's not usually the conversation. They're trying to convert me. Well, that's the whole point, is that we don't have to convert anyone. There's nothing to convert. Conversion is done with religions, and we're not talking about any religion at all. In fact, the teachings of the Buddha wasn't a religion when Buddha was alive. There was no such thing as Buddhism, but in fact it wasn't until about 150 years later that they even started calling him Buddha. Before that, he was just Sakyamuni, the sage of the Sakyans. So Buddhism was an invention of a religion, just like Christianity was the invention of a religion. Just like Islam was an invented, made-up religion. And we don't need a religion. We don't need to convert to a religion. We don't need to convert anyone from their religion to our religion. All we need to do is just to be happy. That makes it easy.

**Speaker E:** Uh, I have one question.

**Speaker A:** Is this— is that okay? All right, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Can you describe me more?

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker E:** I think being content is, is, is what Anapanasati is, right? Like being happy, being content. Being happy means like you happy with what is already happening, so it's like content.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can be happy no matter what's happening. In other words, you're actually now taking your happiness and putting it out there as a contingency. Let's not be happy in a contingent way. Let's just be happy, because what's happening is, uh, only a mind game anyway. So let's stop playing the mind games and just be.

**Speaker E:** Happy.

**Speaker A:** Mhm. Happy. Yeah, just be happy. Just be okay. Everything is fine, but we have to.

**Speaker E:** Practice. Everything is fine. Yeah, I'm safe, I'm secure, I'm comfortable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're already.

**Speaker E:** Okay. Okay, I'm getting myself like practice this again because I'm getting rusty, right?

**Speaker A:** So you got to practice that. You have to practice being okay because otherwise you'll slide right back into the old style, your old way of doing things. Yep, you have to practice regularly, often. Everything is all right, not a problem in the world. So Ivan, do you have any more to.

**Speaker F:** Say?

**Speaker B:** Oh, sorry. Uh, no, nothing.

**Speaker A:** Um, it makes perfect sense. All right, does anybody else have something? If not, then Mikey. Take it.

**Speaker D:** Away. Yes. Thank you for this splendid sermon, Reverend.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** I appreciate it. Very thankful. Yeah, this has been great. When it comes to religion, what I like to say is we don't need to take other people's toys away. And many people have this toy that they call Jesus.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker D:** And we can just keep again pointing back to the teaching of the Buddha. We don't have to say, oh, you're wrong, you're wrong. We can say, hey, just take it easy. It's all right. Everything's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** God is great. That's okay, too. So, yeah. Thank you, friends, for being here today.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) and the Sangha:

### **Core Theme: Integrating Buddha's Teachings Within Other Religions**
The talk explores an idea attributed to Ajahn Buddhadasa: that people don't need to convert to Buddhism. Instead, they can find and practice the core of the Buddha's teachings *within* their own religious framework.

### **Main Arguments and Points:**

1.  **Historical Precedent:** Buddhism has historically adapted by adding its teachings to existing local religions (e.g., Shinto in Japan, Bon in Tibet, animism in Thailand), rather than seeking to replace them.

2.  **The Problem with Modern "Western" Buddhism:** When Buddhism comes West, it often becomes detached from its core teachings, turning into secular "mindfulness" or psychology, or a new, separate religion called "Buddhism."

3.  **The Problem with Modern Christianity:** The speaker argues that mainstream Christianity, especially in the West, has become politicized, angry, and focused on dogma (anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, etc.), losing the essence of Jesus's teachings about love, forgiveness, and the present moment.

4.  **The Universal "Duality":** The core teaching identified across traditions is the duality within every person:
    *   **Lower Nature / Devil / Instinct:** Characterized by greed, anger, ill-will, fear, and judgment.
    *   **Higher Nature / Angel / Wisdom:** Characterized by love, forgiveness, peace, and wholesomeness.
    *   This aligns perfectly with the Buddhist practice of recognizing **wholesome vs. unwholesome thoughts**.

5.  **Strategy for Engagement: Don't Argue, Translate.**
    *   **Do NOT** debate Christian dogma (e.g., divinity of Jesus, resurrection). The speaker calls much of it "bullshit" that obscures the true teachings.
    *   **DO** focus on the practical, wholesome teachings **of Jesus** that align with Dhamma:
        *   "God loves you" → You already have infinite love and security; be happy now.
        *   "The kingdom of God is within you" → Peace and heaven are available in the present moment, within your own mind/body (like a *basilica* or temple).
        *   Forgiveness of sins → You can be free from guilt and "sin no more" through present-moment practice.
        *   "Watch and pray" (in Gethsemane) → Practice mindfulness (*sati*) and right view.

6.  **The Essential Practice is the Same:**
    *   The goal is to **stop listening** to the lower nature (fear, anger, desire) and **start listening** to the higher nature (love, contentment, wisdom).
    *   This is practiced by noticing unwholesome thoughts and consciously cultivating wholesome ones—**"be happy," "everything is okay right now."**
    *   This practice of **contentment** and **gratitude** ("thank you, God") is itself the path, more valuable than rituals or doctrinal battles.

7.  **Enlightenment Re-framed:** Enlightenment (*bodhi*) is simply "waking up" to this duality, "shining a light" on your mind, and choosing the wholesome. It's an instant shift available now ("instant enlightenment"), not a distant future goal.

### **Sangha Discussion Highlights:**
*   **RJ (Jain):** Confirmed similar dynamics in Jainism, where external rituals are emphasized over internal happiness, and noted that simple truths are often rejected because they seem "too simple" or undermine people's existing (hard) religious efforts.
*   **Anna:** Found the Gospels "cute" but the rest of Christianity "annoying" and political.
*   **Harold:** Connected Christian practices like "talking to God" to mindfulness and even the *jhānas* (meditative absorptions), noting how mystical experiences can reinforce religious belief if not understood technically.
*   **Christina:** Resonated with the reframing of "instinct as devil" vs. "wisdom as angel," and criticized the "transactional" nature of heaven-based morality.
*   **Mikey:** Concluded with the metaphor of not needing to "take other people's toys away"—let people have "Jesus" as their framework, and gently point them toward the core practice of ease and happiness within it.

### **Final Takeaway:**
The talk advocates for a **non-proselytizing, essence-based approach**. You can teach the Buddha's Dhamma using the language and symbols of any religion by focusing on universal, practical psychology: shifting from a mind of lack, fear, and judgment to a mind of contentment, love, and present-moment awareness. The message is: **"Don't worry, be happy. God loves you. You're already okay. Just practice remembering that."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (primarily Speaker A, Dhammarato) to explain his perspective on Buddhism, Christianity, and religious practice:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Angel and the Devil on the Shoulders:** This is the central metaphor of the talk.
    *   **Source:** Referenced from childhood cartoons.
    *   **Meaning:** Represents the internal duality present in all people.
    *   **Buddhist Interpretation:** The **devil** symbolizes our **instincts**—greed, anger, ill will, and ignorance (unwholesome thoughts). The **angel** symbolizes our **wisdom** and **higher nature** (wholesome thoughts).
    *   **Purpose:** To frame the core Buddhist practice of recognizing and choosing wholesome over unwholesome thoughts in a universally relatable, Christian-friendly image.

2.  **Baggage:** Used to describe the preconceptions, cultural conditioning, and theological ideas people bring with them when they approach Buddhism from another religious background (especially Christianity).

3.  **Bullshit:** A blunt metaphor for what the speaker sees as the doctrinal and political accretions in modern Christianity (e.g., specific dogmas, politicized anger) that obscure the core teachings of Jesus.

4.  **An Ocean, Bathtub, or Swimming Pool of Love vs. a Teacup:** Used to illustrate the concept of God's love. If God's love is an ocean, then a person already has "all the love they could use," making the anxious pursuit of love from other sources unnecessary.

5.  **The Body as a Temple / Cathedral / Basilica:** Links the Christian idea ("your body is the temple of God") to the Buddhist concept of the "kingdom of God within you" (Luke 17:21). The Greek word "*basileia*" (kingdom) is connected to "basilica" (a grand church), suggesting that the individual's own mindful awareness is the true sacred space.

6.  **God's Plan:** Presented as a metaphor for surrendering control and anxiety about the future. If "God's got a plan," then one can stop frantic personal planning and "just let God do it," akin to practicing acceptance and being in the present moment.

7.  **The Forbidden Fruit as a "Mind Game":** The story of Adam and Eve is reinterpreted. The "fruit of the knowledge of good and evil" is seen not as a literal fruit but as the human tendency to label and judge (this is good, that is bad). This judgmental mindset is what creates suffering, not a divine punishment.

8.  **Prayer as Transaction vs. Thanksgiving:** Contrasts two models:
    *   **Transactional Prayer:** Asking God for things (portrayed as an expression of greed and need).
    *   **Prayer as Thanksgiving:** Grateful acknowledgment for what one already has (portrayed as the correct practice leading to contentment).

9.  **Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star:** An analogy for spiritual practice. A student shouldn't ask for more advanced teachings ("is there more?") before mastering the fundamental practice ("just start practicing" being happy and content with the present).

### **Key Stories & Historical Examples**

1.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Teaching:** The talk is framed around the story of the Thai Buddhist monk **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**, who often said **"there is no reason for anyone to join another religion."** This serves as the thesis for the entire talk: that Buddhism can enrich one's native religion without requiring conversion.

2.  **Buddhism's Historical Integration:** Several stories are used to show Buddhism historically adapting to, rather than replacing, local beliefs:
    *   **Japan:** The story of temples with **no dividing wall** between Shinto and Zen sections.
    *   **Tibet:** Buddhism integrated into Tibetan culture so seamlessly that it can be hard to distinguish.
    *   **Thailand:** The continued practice of **animist and Hindu rituals** (e.g., visiting the Erawan Shrine and Arahant) alongside Buddhism by the same people, without conflict.

3.  **The Story of Western "McMindfulness":** The talk describes how Buddhism is often entering the West stripped of its religious and ethical context, becoming **"Vipassana" or "mindfulness meditation"** that is **"basically part of psychology."** This is a cautionary tale about losing the core teaching (the transformation of unwholesome to wholesome) in translation.

4.  **Jesus's Actions in the Gospels:** Specific Gospel stories are reinterpreted to align with the "angel/devil" practice:
    *   **Forgiving the Sins of the Criminal on the Cross:** Used to argue that forgiveness doesn't require Jesus's death; it's available in the present moment.
    *   **"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone":** Used to teach non-judgment.
    *   **"Go and sin no more":** Linked to the practice of abandoning unwholesome thoughts.
    *   **Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane "watching":** Equated with the Buddhist practice of **Right View** or mindfulness (*sati*).
    *   **"Get behind me, Satan":** Interpreted as a command to put one's lower nature (instincts, anger) in the past.

5.  **The Failed Proselytizing Attempt:** A brief story about a Christian evangelist who loses interest in a man once he learns the man is already studying to be a preacher. This story illustrates the speaker's point that modern evangelism is often about "saving souls" for the group's benefit rather than genuine teaching or friendship.

### **Overall Narrative**
The talk weaves these metaphors and stories into a larger **narrative**: 
**Buddhism is not a competing religion, but a "technology of mind" that can be applied within any religious framework.** The core practice—discerning and choosing wholesome thoughts over unwholesome ones—can be taught using the language and symbols of the listener's own tradition (e.g., "listen to the angel, not the devil"). The goal is to help people find peace and contentment ("be happy, God loves you right now") within their existing spiritual home, rather than encouraging them to convert.
