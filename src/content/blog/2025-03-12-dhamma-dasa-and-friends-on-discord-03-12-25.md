### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I haven't DJ'd in a long time. I wonder how is it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wonder how DJ. Thanks, Alex.

**Speaker C:** Of course.

**Speaker B:** Alex, how do I do it, or is it like not possible in the future?

**Speaker C:** It is not too hard. I'll send you a link to the software. It's OBS.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you need software.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but it's really easy. You download OBS. And it sets itself up, and then, okay, yeah, like it has like a recommended settings thing. You just pick like, oh, I'm gonna record my screen or whatever, and it sets all the recommended settings. And then you just have to tell it to look at this window, like our chat window, and then you click record. So it's like 3 steps, like it's pretty, pretty easy.

**Speaker B:** I could even make a little video.

**Speaker C:** About how to set it up. If you wanted to.

**Speaker B:** Oh, if I— oh yeah, I'll see if I, uh, download it or something.

**Speaker C:** You have to use the computer, which is the only— you can't use a phone.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you have to use either a desktop or laptop?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I don't think they have a mobile way to do it. Like Skype's so easy, you just click the button.

**Speaker B:** But with this one, dude, I had the best laptop with all the software I liked on it and I forgot my password, dude. I forgot it for like 6 months now. I tried, but it's like I've tried every password. Yeah, I could think of every which way I could think of.

**Speaker C:** I don't know, it's like maybe you.

**Speaker B:** Can get somebody on Craigslist to crack.

**Speaker C:** It for you or something. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know. It's such a shame. I can't believe I didn't write it. And ironically, I write down all my passwords. That was just the one I had. I thought I wrote it down, but apparently it wasn't it. You know how it goes. Yep, I think everybody's been there once or twice.

**Speaker C:** Oh, absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this was in the— this was a really important one though. It had like all my shit. Of course. But it's a good lesson in letting go.

**Speaker C:** Yes. Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Have you guys heard from DJ?

**Speaker C:** I haven't.

**Speaker A:** I haven't called him. Oh yeah.

**Speaker C:** Right now and see if we can get him over here too.

**Speaker B:** I love DJ, dude.

**Speaker C:** I know, me too.

**Speaker B:** Hi Jonas.

**Speaker A:** I haven't seen Jonas in a long time too.

**Speaker B:** Are you in India, Jonas? You're in Thailand, bro.

**Speaker D:** Bro, I'm at Dhammarato's place right now since like 2 days.

**Speaker B:** The roof looks just like Dhammarato's. I knew it was Cool, man.

**Speaker A:** Is Dhammarato awake?

**Speaker D:** Oh, I think he's sleeping right now.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, it's like 3 in the morning over there.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's like 7:30 right now.

**Speaker B:** Oh, 7:30. That's cool, man. How you like it?

**Speaker D:** Oh, it's simple, but it's good. I like— I appreciate a lot that I can be here. Yeah, it's cool.

**Speaker B:** Enjoy the simple lifestyle.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. I haven't seen you guys in some time.

**Speaker B:** I know, dude. Well, hopefully you can come more often. That would be dope.

**Speaker D:** Well, yeah, let's see. Let's see. Kind of right now I've been traveling the last few months.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker C:** Let's see.

**Speaker B:** That's cool, man. Yeah, yeah, technology is hard enough in the States, let alone in Thailand. Not just technology, but all the stuff.

**Speaker D:** That.

**Speaker B:** Goes into it, like moisture and stuff like that. Probably not always easy, but— well, yeah, that's one thing.

**Speaker D:** But also, like, while traveling is Yeah, I don't even know what I'm doing tomorrow. So, right.

**Speaker B:** Probably breathing in and breathing out.

**Speaker A:** I love that.

**Speaker E:** Probably.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that funny? It's like I'm 40 years old and it's like all this drama, all this stuff I can see in my mind. Of my whole life, all the things I've done. But really, it's all been no different than just this moment, you know, just breathing in and breathing out. It's kind of beautiful. It's like no matter what heaven or hell you experience, it's just like.

**Speaker A:** Just.

**Speaker B:** A sweet emptiness that's always available. Pretty nice.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, no, go ahead, dude.

**Speaker A:** I think it was you, Dhamma, that you often talk about one of these Anicca books called Still Flowing Water. Do you Oh.

**Speaker B:** Still, what the hell is it called? Still Forest Pool.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's the other one, maybe. Yeah, the one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe he has another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he has quite several books, but I was just reading, man, it's just so— the way he goes about talking, it It's just, I mean, oh, I would say every Arhat, even Bhikkhu Buddha Dasa, I mean, everyone should speak about Dharma, but the way Ajahn Chah talks about it, he really has this— when I read it, the experience has been like I become very disenchanted with whatever's in my mind, whatever's in the world, just this. Yeah, it's just like everything's okay right now, no problem. I don't know, I just like how he talks about it. It's really nice.

**Speaker B:** Have you guys ever seen the movie Office Space?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I love that movie.

**Speaker B:** Great movie.

**Speaker C:** It is wonderful.

**Speaker B:** I was telling my friend who's not really into like Dharma stuff, you know, he's not familiar with the lingo or any Buddhism or anything like But I was telling him, like, you know, all the spiritual books I've ever read, they all come down to you really just got to be like that guy in the movie after he's hypnotized. Like, whatever comes your way, both good or bad, you just have to be like, all right, man, I'll just do the best I can, and whatever happens, happens. I don't really give a shit. Yeah, just let it flow where it does.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, absolutely. Come on, buddy.

**Speaker B:** And later on in the movie, he gets a little bit more attached again. But the middle way of the movie is really great. His viewpoint, because it's like Ramana Maharshi said, or so they say, I read a quote somewhere, but he said the only spiritual practice you need is to not react in all situations, just remain calm. And I thought, that's so beautiful, man, just to remain calm. And that's, that's what Ajahn Chah, like you were saying, he's really good at, uh, communicating that in many different ways, but in ways that really stick with you, you know? Like, um, everything he does, everything he talks about is very— like, do you guys remember that story when, uh, Yes. Oh, hi, Vad.

**Speaker C:** Nice.

**Speaker B:** Hi, how's it going, dude?

**Speaker C:** Oh good, Michael's here too.

**Speaker B:** He's coming, getting some people. It's going really great, you guys.

**Speaker C:** Wonderful.

**Speaker B:** But, um, do you remember that, uh, story that, that, uh that I don't know, Ivan, that Ajahn Chah said that was about Ajahn— is it Brahman or an Arhat? Where he said Ajahn Brahm was saying that he was in the hospital and he was nearly dead because he was very sick, and he got word that Ajahn Chah was coming to visit him. And he had all these monks with him, and the whole hospital was up in arms because they couldn't— I mean, in a good way, they couldn't believe that this wonderful monk was coming. He's famous, blah blah blah. And Ajahn Brahm himself was very pleased that Ajahn Chah was coming. He was very old and he didn't make much visits or something, I don't know. But when he came, the only thing he told Ajahn Brahm was Well, you're either gonna live or you're gonna die. See ya. He just like turned around and walked away. And Ajahn Brahm thought he was gonna give this beautiful poetic thing and wisdom, but he did give wisdom, great wisdom, in the most real way you can, which is showing him, hey man, we're all in the same boat. We're either gonna live or die, get sick or stay healthy. We have no control over it. We can only control what's in between our ears, like Dhammarato says. So when we accept that, when we learn to practice the Dhamma in all situations, it really is awesome. It's almost like a cheat code in life. It's— you ever play video games with somebody and they just take it way too seriously? Yes, like you play Mario Brothers or Smash Brothers or something, and then your one friend would flip out and lose his mind. You're like, dude, chill out, it's just a video game, you know. It's really like when you're— when you become invested in your emotions, when you give them your attention, it's like a possession in a way. You really do become possessed by these demons. You really do become possessed by Mara. And the food that Mara thrives on, like an internet troll, is attention. It wants attention. But if you don't give it attention, if you just laissez-faire, kind of ignore it half-assed, it just doesn't really give it its kicks in a way. And it leaves you alone. Hi Max, hi everybody who joined.

**Speaker D:** Hey there, how's it going?

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** How's it going, dude? But we're just talking about— Remind me.

**Speaker D:** A lot of— I've been at— on Koh Samui, in a silent retreat. I don't know if you know it, it's called Deepabhavana. It's where— it's the wat where Wat Pho is the abbot. And I was there and I kind of had the— there was nothing to do, right? So you just listen to some Dhamma, do some walking and sitting meditation, and apart from that, nothing much. And at some point during my practice, It kind of came to me and I was filled super much with like joy that there's like nothing much to do. There's no right or wrong meditation practice. Doesn't matter if I stand up or sit down now or open or close my eyes. And there are no rights or wrongs anymore. Nothing is better or worse than anything else. And kind of with that, what it leaves you at is you just start to observe what is this body doing. It's doing its body things and mind is doing its mind things. And you're just left with looking at it just like you look at nature or whatever, it's like a story unfolding in front of you, kind of. And yeah, that's like so beautiful that it's just like you stop taking the driver's seat and you just go in the back seat and look like what is going on here. You just stand or sit there and you're totally like in peace, but everything just happens as it was before.

**Speaker B:** Anybody else have anything they want to say about what Jonas said, or anything they want to express about the Dharma?

**Speaker A:** It's really just that simple.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** It really is that simple. I think we overcomplicate it a lot, like you have to practice this way and you have to do this or that, and then we construct our own little world of, okay, I have to practice this much meditation now in the morning, or I have to wake up at this time, I have to eat less chocolate. Or whatever it is that we create there that we think takes us somewhere further in the practice, whatever that means. But doing that is already, we're already in that illusion, right? And like when we realize that there's absolutely nothing to do, and there's, this all kind of falls away. And it's just eating chocolate is just eating chocolate. And listening to a whatever Spotify song, it's just listening to a song. Yeah, simple, really is simple.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that's why I think isolation is important, like Dhammarato says, especially at first, is because in isolation you really do have to look in the mirror by yourself and You're the one who's responsible. So when you're by yourself, you know, that's why I get so impressed when I hear stories of the old Tibetan masters, or any master, or any person, or whatever you want to call it, who has spent years in isolation— 7 years, 10 years, 15 years— because all the pretension— like Bukowski says, when he was a kid, his father was a great literary teacher because he beat the pretense out of him. That's kind of what isolation does.

**Speaker C:** That's a good one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It beats the pretentious, the pretension out of you, the pretentious nature of your mind. The ego, it beats the ego out of you. And can you be satisfied when nobody's awarding you with their attention? Can you be satisfied when you're in danger or safe? Or in between, can be satisfied in isolation. That is the great test that is not absolutely necessary, but is a very good guideline and highly recommended for people who are wanting to do Dhamma practice. Isolation is wonderful, and it doesn't always have to be in a cave in Tibet. You could be surrounded by people in a in a ballroom and feel more isolated than you've ever been in your life. So the environment is not necessarily that important. But basically, can you stand to be alone? You know, whether there's literally physical people there or not, I think is a very important question. Because a lot of the people— I'm sorry, Alex, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** No, I just was thinking back to what you said earlier about not reacting. All you have to do is not react, and that's our seclusion right there. And getting into that physical seclusion, that kaya viveka, at first, that's really beautiful because it really lets us see that that's even a possibility. But like you said, you can be in a ballroom dancing and be all by yourself. And it's just about, can we keep that stillness? Really, it doesn't require much effort. Like our friend Jonas said, it's really just this. It's really simple. It's really nice and easy. You know, we just have to let it be what it is. Stop taking it and trying to make it what we think it should be.

**Speaker B:** All right, go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker A:** Uh, something DJ, me and him talk about, he said something really simple, and I think about that sometimes, is, you know, the only— we're talking about standard because sometimes we set a lot of standard for ourselves, especially me, because that's how I used to seeing things. And it's just, it was something he liked to say, like, set the bar so low you hit it every time. Or you could also say there's no bar at all. But basically it's about the physical seclusion. Uh, basically it's just, you know, if you can get yourself alone by yourself, that's already the practice. Uh, and I, I like to think about that sometimes because, yeah, sometimes I do make it difficult for myself, you know. It's like, oh no, I I have to get by myself and I have to remember this, remember that. It's just so much complication. It's just if I could see that, hey, I'm alone by myself right now, that's already a success. Well, good job. Half the job is already done. It's really nice to just remember that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, hi Ben.

**Speaker B:** Welcome everyone. Hey, hey, Will Chamberlain, is that a basketball player? Welcome everybody, we're just talking about the Dharma. If you have anything you want to say whatsoever, don't be afraid, we're just talking. So yeah.

**Speaker C:** Hi.

**Speaker B:** Especially if you're newcomers, don't be afraid to ask questions or talk.

**Speaker D:** Is this the Sangha US or is it not? Actually, sorry for the question.

**Speaker B:** This is kind of a new Well, this is part of Dhammarato's Sangha, but this is kind of a new format because we're switching from Skype to Discord apparently. So I'm just kind of going with the flow, and that's what this is. And I'm going to try to do it every Wednesday at different times because that helps me out to do it more often if I could figure out the times and then just kind of tell people what times they'll be ahead of time. So yeah, we're just talking about the Dharma, nothing crazy.

**Speaker D:** It's good, like Mikey told me just a second ago that something's going on here, so I'm happy that it's not like in the middle of the night, I think. Otherwise, the normal time would be in the middle of the night for me right now.

**Speaker B:** Good, man. That's good. Yeah, my son, he has special needs, and we got him a tablet, and when he listens to it, he listens to it on full brightness, full volume, and it's actually a great Dhamma tool because he's on it so often it calms him down. But when he first got it, I was going insane because I'm— I have the type of brain that's like very agitated by sounds, like people chewing and shit. So he's a great— yeah, he's a great Dharma practitioner and teacher because he's teaching me kind of like Jetsun Milarepa, like everything that's ever bothered me. He like he'll like go full force. But after— and I used to put— I used to put Play-Doh in the speakers to try to make it just half volume because there's no— there's no setting to just set it at half and put in a little child code and it won't, you know. So there's lots of stuff I would do. But now I'll talk to my friends and they'll be like, dude, what is that noise blasting in the speaker, in your microphone? Oh, I'm sorry, that's what— I don't even hear it anymore. I don't even hear it. And that's amazing to me. And it really shows just the biology of humans being able to adapt to their surroundings so easily. But also, if you're practicing the Dharma, it becomes— you go through the process a little faster and in a more positive way. But yeah, I don't even hear this stuff now. So I always have to be mindful. Fulfill. So I can mute my stuff when it's going blasting super loud. So if you ever come and you hear random noises in the background, that's what that is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** I had a similar thing when I moved into— Sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, no, go ahead, Bhante.

**Speaker F:** I moved into a new apartment. And I'm in Vietnam, in Hanoi, and it gets quite cold in winter. And when winter came, the apartment's got single-glazed windows and it's quite close to other buildings. And this, I noticed in the evening, this sound started. This, like, I think the AC units nearby were set to heat. And this, like, rhythmic humming noise that got louder and louder and sort of cycled and got faster and faster and then stopped. For like 5 seconds and then started again and got louder and louder and faster. And before, it would have really bothered me, like having constant noise all the time, but I was like, it's not my sound, and I just didn't care. It's so simple and so easy to just be like, not my problem, and then it goes away.

**Speaker A:** It's so funny over here. I told Alex a few weeks ago, I was just talking about how the mind can go crazy sometimes when I least expected it. So it was in the middle of the night and it was just some bugs flying around in the kitchen and I was trying to talk to someone on the phone, I mean talking to my girlfriend on the phone, but then I keep getting annoyed by this bug flying. I can't explain, the rage was unexplainable. And I keep questioning myself, why am I getting angry at this? And but then the next morning comes, it's weird, right? Like, I don't know, my girlfriend was just making fun of me. Why am I annoyed at something so small? And then I was looking back, I was like, yeah, why did that happen? Like, I don't know, the mind goes kind kind of weird sometimes. You just latch onto something, and the more I say, don't be mad at that, there's nothing, and then I get more mad. The more I tell myself I shouldn't be mad, the more mad I get. And it's weird. But I found in reality I was already dissatisfied from the beginning. The flight was just what triggers it. In reality, deep inside me, I was already in full-blown Dukkha. I just didn't see it. So it's funny. Yeah, it's not the bark, it's me.

**Speaker G:** Morning, people.

**Speaker C:** Morning.

**Speaker A:** Oh, morning.

**Speaker G:** How's everyone doing?

**Speaker C:** Well, how are you?

**Speaker G:** Tired. I have a full day today. Yeah, nice. I was teaching my son Buddhism last night after hanging out in Discord for a bit. He went up to me, asked me this, Daddy, is Jesus the best friend of Buddha? Then I was like, good question. I have never thought about it. Jesus does teach about so-and-so, and Buddha compassion. I was like, maybe, maybe they're friends, who knows. We are trying to teach him how to be, how to practice the.

**Speaker B:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker G:** How to practice loving kindness in school. Because he's the type that would probably bully the other kids. My son is the bigger, bigger type. He's not like me, he's in school now. So I'm trying to teach him, you know, when you see people, they might be scared of you, please, you know, show them care. Please don't go and bully them, please. No, I don't want to get a call from a teacher that you go and bully another kid, which he has the tendency of. Quite recently, I think he like hit a kid over Legos. I was trying to teach him. Hopefully he's practicing. Eh, Vikkhandikan. Thankfully he's not an iPad kid though. My wife objected to it, so I wanted to get him an iPad. There goes my life, I guess. Don't spoil him with technology now. Retain his proper chahu while we can, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker G:** Have you eaten?

**Speaker A:** No, I don't eat breakfast, but I think others have already eaten.

**Speaker G:** I guess the rest has eaten.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's neat that you talk about the Jesus and the Buddha and everything else. It's neat to think that one of the ways we can talk about the word Dharma in English is just as nature, natural law, reality. So even Sakyamuni Buddha, when he talks about his rediscovery of this path, he talks about it. He says it is an old path, it's not a new path. So it's not as if Jesus needed the Buddha to teach him anything about Dharma. Jesus just needed to look and see, and he found some of the same things. When we look and see, we find some of the same things. So when we talk about Dhamma, it's not as if it's a new thing that's ever discovered. It's a recognition, a knowing again of what's here right now. So when we talk about not reacting, not making it complex, it's really all there is that needs to be done, is to toss out that to-do list and to just look and see what's here right now without telling big complicated stories. Stories about it, and then we can see this same thing that the Buddha saw, that maybe Jesus awoke to, that all these people that talk about the nature of things tend to talk about.

**Speaker G:** I'm also quite scared today. I'm teaching at a Buddhist college, so it's my first lesson with adults. I'm very scared.

**Speaker C:** I'm sure you'll do well. What will you talk about?

**Speaker G:** So it's applying Buddhism into parenthood. It's my first class. Hopefully I don't mess up.

**Speaker D:** You will do well.

**Speaker G:** It's a bit stressful. The parents are those who are parents with special needs kids. So something, whatever I say, may not be applicable to them. So it's really a lot of considering on what to teach and we just narrow it down to a few stuff. It's like a full day program.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That's really cool to share like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's cool, man. Don't be afraid to give a speech or whatever. Adults are just big children, you know, just with a more advanced vocabulary. Some of them, yeah.

**Speaker G:** Anagami, Arhat, Bhikkhuni, I kind of agree. I saw one yesterday. Oh, Jesus Christ. I was buying cookies, then because I bought the last 2 packs of Famous Amos biscuits, right? That fella behind me had a meltdown, like a full crash out, start crying, start making a scene like how I'm an asshole for taking the last 2 packets. Then I was like, chill, they are baking.

**Speaker B:** More.

**Speaker G:** Come on, there's more being made. You're not going to die. It's just two flavors that I want to buy. Come on, for my breakfast and for my son.

**Speaker A:** I mean, the world starts to look very funny when you see everyone's just Anagami, Anapanasati, like big children.

**Speaker G:** Ivan, since you live in Malaysia, right? If you ever eat Famous Amos, they got the Nasi Lemak flavor. Not bad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't really like it for some reason.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I know it's salty, but then it still tastes like chocolate chip.

**Speaker A:** Anyways, yeah, it's too sweet for my taste for some reason.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But it's cheap.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, so I also— last my last night, I had a very interesting— a bit off topic. I hope I'm not making anyone bored about my life. I'm sorry. I think Green Sage— let me know.

**Speaker A:** What I was talking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're fine, man.

**Speaker G:** This is the place I can truly like share my true feelings out a bit than I would go in Hong Kong.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, talk about whatever you wish.

**Speaker G:** I think Vinaya should know what I'm talking about. So last night there was this guy who keeps on berating me for, you know, not being a true Buddhist.

**Speaker E:** Oh, you're talking about Truth?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, he was like, oh, the monks are just wearing the robes for the sake of wearing them. They are not true Buddhists. Then I was like, Like, how can you assume?

**Speaker E:** I had— I, I DM'd Panda and I was like, uh, Truth is schizophrenic. So I was like, he has a different relationship with facts and reasoning.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** Like, Truth will say something like, oh yeah, the real Buddhism is this. And it's, it's, it's a monumental task to try to discuss that premise with him. He's already decided. He's had some train of thought where he's decided, like, whatever he said the Buddhism was, he's like, oh, this is the real teaching. Like, he has decided that there's a whole chain of decisions, and they're all kind of like very like personal to him. So to try to go backwards through it is, is just— so I usually just roll forward, like, okay, I'll be like, I'm not sure everyone agrees with that's Buddhism. They might see if I'm, you know, I just can't— you can't like touch— you can't question the core belief. And Panda was just like, what, what are you talking about, dude? Like, that's not Buddhism. And Truth was like, yeah, that totally is Buddhism. And Panda's like, am I crazy? Am I like— he's like, I this like my whole life? Did I like miss something?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, it's on some like extra DLC that, that needs to be added.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker G:** Some Big Bang event.

**Speaker E:** But what's interesting about Troop is he has— he'll, he'll— like what he was saying today, like he was like, I have to go 50% Nirvana, 50% Samsara.

**Speaker B:** What?

**Speaker E:** Right, because— right, he was trying— he'll come up with very interesting ways discussing legitimate ideas, like the Middle Way, right? But he talks about these imperatives as if they're real. One time he told me he was afraid to get enlightened because that meant someone was going to die. Yeah. And I was just like, okay.

**Speaker A:** But you'll see.

**Speaker E:** So I had a conversation with him about whether or not he should get enlightened, what he should pursue. We couldn't really touch too much. I had him explain to me the mechanics. Of why someone would die, and it had to do with like a friend of his died and they were both into Buddhism. So since he was like carrying it forward, it was like a price he paid. So if he would get enlightened and his friend didn't, then that meant like someone else had to die. It was some convoluted thing.

**Speaker C:** That's my Anicca.

**Speaker G:** But God bless him, you know.

**Speaker D:** He.

**Speaker E:** Changed his name from Truth to Sati, which means truth in Sanskrit. And he said because it was someone else had a name, one of his friends committed suicide or something, had a name that was similar to Truth. Yeah, so you can see like where he's basically— someone else would say, well, you know, I feel it reminds me too much of my friend, sort of like out of sense, it makes me feel sentimental, so I'm just— I changed my name. Truth was like, no, because the names are similar, I'm like stealing from him. Or it was some— I didn't— but his previous name was Truth instead of Truth, like T-R-O-O-F. And, uh, I just thought that was so great because I was like, Truth doesn't speak the truth, he speaks the truth. It's like the truth is always right. He'll have like really great beautiful insights. We have to see it through the lens of like someone speaking schizophrenically.

**Speaker G:** But the conversation got very interesting after you left. It devolved into him like claiming that I am a demon.

**Speaker E:** Oh, nice.

**Speaker G:** I am now a demon.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I reckon.

**Speaker A:** I believe you.

**Speaker B:** Are you sure?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, actually I am. Maybe that's how demons are controlled, that they don't think they're demons.

**Speaker G:** Maybe I am a demon. Who knows? I'm like, what, 50% demon and then 50% on the verge of gaining.

**Speaker B:** The mind?

**Speaker G:** I'm on the middle way already.

**Speaker E:** There's a Buddhist, um, well, this is in the Zen scripture, but I think they're quoting from a sutra where Buddha's talking to like the king of demons or something.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And he says, and he's— I don't know if it was Yama, because it might have been a demon king. It could have been Yama. But it was the king of demons, or a king of demons, and I got to find it. He said something like, I'll get enlightened last. I'll let everyone else get enlightened first or something. Oh yeah, I'll be the last one to get enlightened. And then the Buddha was basically saying, you don't really sound like a demon.

**Speaker G:** I'm trying to find it. I talked to her, Christine. We were saying that our concept of demon knowledge, our demons don't actually sound like what the Christians perceive demons as— what does the Christian perceive demons as? Hell beings. They will only— what's their sole purpose? Torture. Torture and then sound like a demon. But when it comes to our demons, it's more like, you know, they won't exactly sound as the conventional demon, but they will still sound as— but they will still look like one. That means they may have— maybe their purpose is to misguide us. Or challenge us along our course of practice. I always say there's demons everywhere in the world. As you know, there may be a Bodhisattva amongst us. We just treat those people who are treating us difficult as demons and treat them as obstacles to conquer and learn, and that can bring us further. I always tell people, especially when I teach monks, if you've come across a difficult layperson treat them as a learning point and work upon that learning point and understand them, and you will be able to overcome them. Same goes when I teach my way.

**Speaker E:** From my point of view, I see everyone as Buddhas basically, or it's like a manifestation of Buddha. And so like when I'm talking to difficult people, I'll often talk past them and talk to the Buddha that they are, you know what I'm saying? And it's like people will sometimes, they'll say to me something like, well, surely it can't be this. And they'll say something. I'm like, that is probably one of the best summaries of the Dharma I've heard in a long time. They're saying it angrily, like, it can't just be this, you know, that there's nothing to do. It's like that.

**Speaker G:** Like recently, I got into a heated debate with one of my venerables over this topic on who's the first Buddha you see. There's a Chinese saying that.

**Speaker D:** Uh, or.

**Speaker G:** I'll translate back to English. When from time you're born, the first Buddhas you see are not me, not the seven Buddhas of our time, it's your parents. And not a lot of people agree with this idea that your parents are your first Buddhas. They will call like, oh, your parents are your first Bodhisattvas, your parents are so and so on. I treat them as your first Buddhas because they are the way— they are the first few people who teach you. They're the first person, your first friend, your first teacher, your first whatever. And they are like your Buddha, I'll put in the sense the Buddha of the household. They are your number one person to go to first. That's why in the sutra of repaying parent kindness, they are quite highly like frame like they're like the kings of the house, kings and queens of the house. You have to not say worship them, but venerate them, show them the respect, because the mother went through hell to have you. The father had to go through hell to sustain her and you, and then so and so forth. And that's when the truth disagreed with me over this parenting. He was like, ah, you see, that's the problem. This is not religion. Yes, it's not.

**Speaker C:** Working.

**Speaker G:** I'm like, okay.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it can be difficult to talk to sometimes, but it's a— he's a challenge, right? He just makes you better.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I'm learning a lot from him.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker G:** My learning point, while doing my reflection last night, I realized that I may have been too stubborn. Learn new things every day. But he was arguing because he was shooting, he was like arguing over the whole Diamond. He was like, oh, you're taking too literally what the Buddha is saying. I was like, no, we just dig in and explore. If the Buddha talks about this concept, let's go and try. If we can successfully try. Like, currently my friend is trying to practice proper Sati Patana. Then I tell him, you go and try, go and explore. It's not going to be an instant result, but it will definitely bring the result to you. But he argued that, oh no, the result should come instantly. I can't be bothered since.

**Speaker B:** And you guys were talking about enlightenment and what we like to call Nibbana. So I think it's good to clarify what Nibbana means. And it's the old Pali word that they still use according to Dhammarato in Thailand, where It's meant for food to take the food off of the fire or heat or flame and let it cool down to Nibbana. So it's not too much a concept that is very magical or difficult to grasp philosophically. You know, it's something that's very available. To people. And the Buddha was just a person, you know. It's like a psychologist or a scientist. And I think it can be helpful when we demystify a lot of this stuff. And of course, you know, a lot of people are going to look at things in the views of demons and angels and hells and heavens, and that's okay. That could be helpful too, because ironically, when you go down that line of a fantasy, it correlates very easily with the psyche of the human mind. So it's not a far stretch to— you can call Mara an ego, or you can call Mara thoughts, feelings, and emotions, or you can just call it Mara and give it kind of a godlike quality or whatever. But the point is, we're just taking the food off of the fire. We're taking the mind off of the fire And the fire is attachments that tend to lead us toward dukkha. It's not all attachments, it's not all desires. It's the desires that are causing us dukkha, causing us dissatisfaction, and turn that dissatisfaction into Sukkha, joy. So essentially it just comes down to don't worry, be happy. And that's why Dhammarato is very appealing to many people with the way he presents the Buddhist teaching. Is because he demystifies it, he makes it simple, he takes away the bullshit. And then at the end of the day, you're like, oh, it's just like a— it's almost more— I like to think of it sometimes just like a psychological life hack, you know, that you don't have to suffer. And when you get to a place where you are experiencing Nibbana and your Dhamma practice is getting better day by day, there is a world within it that is very miraculous, so to speak, but not in a fantastic way, a very real way. But life itself is miraculous, just the very concept of living and existing in a physical realm and having a whole other inner realm within you of thoughts, feelings, and emotions. That is magic, that is fantasy in a way. But what I'm saying is, once you get into this place, it just becomes very, uh, practical, very real. And it's nothing special, really. It is and it isn't. It's like a yin-yang. It's the most profound, amazing thing ever, but also it's just like, you know, the Zen people say, it's just eating your food and drinking tea. But if you— if we ask ourselves the questions, what do we really want in this world? It's what everybody wants. We want peace. We want peace of mind. And people find it through all kinds of addictions of money and cars and drugs and sex and all this.

**Speaker D:** Shit.

**Speaker B:** But if you can become addicted in a healthy way to the Dhamma, because there are unhealthy ways, but that's not true Dhamma, I guess. But speaking of true Dhamma, what is true Dhamma? Something that alleviates you from your dissatisfaction. Um, but if you get on a path of Dharma practice, that's us. You find it's alleviating you from your dissatisfaction. Um, you get that which everybody seeks through other means of addiction. Uh, you, uh, you get that. Hi, sorry, my wife just came in. But speak amongst yourself.

**Speaker G:** A bit off topic, if you do prayers, please dedicate marriage to one of my Dharma brothers. He just got diagnosed with cancer.

**Speaker A:** We don't really do marriage.

**Speaker G:** We've learned to accept the fate. I just went for a test, so waiting for results for mine as well. I'm also fearful that I might get.

**Speaker D:** It.

**Speaker G:** Because it runs in my family. For me, if I get it, that's the end for me, I guess. Oh, nice cat.

**Speaker E:** Wait, what sort of cancer is it?

**Speaker G:** It will be the intestine.

**Speaker D:** Oh wow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** As it tells.

**Speaker B:** You got that or somebody else got that?

**Speaker G:** No, somebody else got that, but I went for a screening for my personal, my own. So one of my Dharma brothers got another form. It's another form of cancer, more aggressive type, as I was told. So what is it? I'm not so sure. I'm very distracted by the cat. That is a very cute cat. I like cats.

**Speaker D:** I love cats. Yeah, I couldn't resist. Barney just came up here and, uh, was looking for snuggles.

**Speaker G:** You should consider getting a pet cat soon.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that cat is cool.

**Speaker E:** What kind of cat is that?

**Speaker D:** She's a Siberian forest cat. Oh wow, very fun.

**Speaker G:** I was thinking of the orange cat or British Shorthair. Because orange cats tend to be a little bit more— I'll use the word stupid.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, stupid cats are so fun, man.

**Speaker G:** Orange cats, I just admire.

**Speaker A:** Them. Like, they just don't give any fucks. Dhammarato has two cats, right? Arhat.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like pretty beautiful ones. I don't know where they're at right now. I'm not sure. But some, like, I sleep here outside on the porch and they wake up at night sometimes. Stepping over me. They're pretty cute.

**Speaker A:** I don't know which video was it. I was just randomly watching one of Dhammarato's videos and he was talking about— I don't know why he was mentioning the cat. I can't remember the context, whether he just— he was making a point, he just brings up the cat like randomly. And then the cat was confused, like, why are you bringing me to the screen? I don't know, it's just so funny.

**Speaker D:** Sometimes they knock stuff over here. I think they basically think it's their place, pretty much. Do whatever they want to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't own the cat, the cat owns you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, how presumptuous you thought you owned that place.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** You'Re right, you're right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, we do have a lot of like that culture, right? This is mine, this is, uh, yeah, I was reading one of Ajahn Chah's where he talked about that, like Vinaya is such a strong conditioning. My stuff, my car, and all those are nice social conventions. It helps to understand the world, but at some point we don't see through that, and it brings suffering. I still think about that.

**Speaker F:** There was a I forget what song it was. There was a song that's got a line in that says death gotta be easy because life is hard. And like, when we're born, we just breathe in, life starts, and then at death we just breathe out and it ends. Like, who knows what happens after that? But yeah, we build it up into this big thing when really it's just breathing out and.

**Speaker A:** That's that.

**Speaker F:** How many times a day do we breathe out? Like, it's going to happen one day. We don't know when. It's pointless worrying about when it's going to happen and how it's going to happen. And I want it to be this way and not that way. And I don't want to die with this condition. I want to have that condition. Like, just breathe. Breathe in and one day you breathe out and you don't breathe in again. Be all right.

**Speaker C:** Big change, but just another change.

**Speaker F:** I like Dhammarato's way of saying it's the final adventure. We don't know what happens after death. It might be really cool.

**Speaker C:** That's right. Never died before.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It's funny, right? We talked about this before, but Even, you know, Christians believe there's a heaven, and I think that's beautiful. There's nothing wrong with that belief. But it's funny because even if you, despite the belief that there's a heaven, they still mourn and feel very, very sad when their loved one passed away. I mean, it's not— it's okay to grieve, but at some point, it's like, if you really believe in heaven, shouldn't you rejoice too? I mean, I know some Christians do, don't get me wrong, but some— I think it's interesting, despite how You know, it's just inevitable. So yeah, I just think it's interesting. Ajahn Chah says something, I think. I don't know, I think it's interesting. I'm still contemplating on that. They say people cry when people die. But he said truthfully, he said the way he sees it, people should cry when babies are born too, because.

**Speaker D:** You.

**Speaker A:** Know, they are going to die too. So why are people feeling happy when— I guess he's not trying to be nihilistic, he's just trying to put things into perspective, like why I feel sad for all these things, like, and you feel happy for the other thing, they are all the same. And yeah, I don't know, I think it's beautiful.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, no birth, no suffering. I was dead for who knows how long before I was born, and I didn't suffer then. At least I don't remember suffering.

**Speaker A:** I was an Arahant for 9 months.

**Speaker C:** Hanging out in the hot tub.

**Speaker B:** Somebody's just chilling for you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yep, definitely.

**Speaker B:** Even if you have periodic mistakes, or you have to— if you have occasional suffering or Dukkha or dissatisfaction, if you have the attitude like, that's okay, Ironically, that is the enlightened mindset. That's the Buddhist mindset. Like, so what if I'm not doing it perfect? So what if I'm not getting it right? So what if my brain is happy one minute, sad, suffering the next? Love you. So what if you can be okay with the brain as it is, even with a little suffering, a little Dukkha? It transforms that Dukkha into something else, even though it's still kind of Dukkha. You know what I mean?

**Speaker D:** The person sounds like with this mindset, like suffering is always in the past. When you think of it, like, I don't know, you try to meditate and you realize, oh, I've been on this thought train for like 10 minutes now. It's this exact moment where you can say, okay, that's it. I'm here again. It was fine. But when you start to think of, oh shit, why have I been thinking of that? I don't want to think of that or whatever. This creates the suffering. But you can just let it go at that moment. So it's like always in the past.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Can we accept that the human brain is going to do what the human brain does? Which is experience all types, thoughts, feelings, and emotions throughout the day.

**Speaker D:** And I think it comes from this— oh, sorry, continue.

**Speaker B:** No, go ahead. We're just.

**Speaker D:** Riffing. It comes from this, like, ideas of what, like, how does liberation or enlightenment look like, and that we should go that meditation means going into what, some form of absorption or no thinking or I don't know. But when you drop all of these ideas and concepts, it's just, I think as I said earlier, it's just sitting with what is. And it doesn't really matter what is.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah, whatever will be will be. And if you're satisfied, You can be in a war zone or in a graveyard or in heaven or hell, but if you're satisfied, it doesn't matter where you are or what's going on. Like, a lot of people will obsess over one thought, feeling, or emotion. For example, anger. Oh, I'm so angry. And right there is the wrong speech. I'm so angry. First of all, it's not you, it's just part of you. It's just a body. It's the body's job to be angry once in a while, just like it's the chicken's job to eat some worms or grain once in a while. It's the brain's job to be sad or fearful or happy or angry sometimes. You have to say, no, I'm a bad Buddhist because I got angry. No, you're just a human. Can you be okay with the fact that you're human? If you can be okay with that, it's so— it's such a relief. It's such a lovely thing because we'll sit down to meditate and say, I have to get somewhere, I have to be somewhere I'm not. But that's the definition of dissatisfaction, is wanting to be somewhere else that you're not, wanting, wanting something to happen that isn't happening the way you want it. But when you flip it on its head and say, hey, whatever happens, happens, You no longer want to be anywhere else but where you are. And then you're done. It's like, sweet.

**Speaker D:** It's like this, even that moment, like when we were angry and we don't want to be angry, it's like our conditioning. Like why can't we say or notice that, oh, I'm angry, how cool is that? How interesting is that? But instead we say, I'm angry and I don't want to fucking be angry. So instead of just seeing it as, well, I'm a human and whatever that means, that's just cool. That's just what it is.

**Speaker F:** Not wanting to be angry is just double dissatisfaction. It's like, oh, I'm angry. Oh, I don't want to be angry. You can be angry at being angry. It's just double anger, double the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Which is what actually made me appreciate the Middle Way so much. It sounds so simple, but I.

**Speaker B:** Keep.

**Speaker A:** Appreciating how profound that wisdom is. So in the middle of anger, you're not telling yourself some story, I shouldn't be angry, or you're not feeding it. You just kind of just stay cool, like in the middle of it. And I find that I learned about myself a lot. I was able to see that weird pattern happening. And then, man, it's just so beautiful. I mean, the first sermon the Buddha gave was the Middle Way. Sometimes I still think that I don't appreciate how wise it is. It's just so simple.

**Speaker B:** And that's why Kamma is so important to understand too, because Kamma is really just the actions and the Sankhara and bad habits. But with Kamma, it's particularly in the physical realm, our actions that are born out of our attachment to thoughts, feelings, or emotions that cause us more Dukkha. And that's like we were saying at the beginning, if we could just learn to remain calm in all situations, who cares if we're angry, who cares if we're afraid? We just can't express those actions in the physical realm, because if we do, what happens if we punch a cop? There's going to be consequences. And it's way easier to deal with no consequences in the physical realm that we didn't cause than if we caused something physically based out of our ignorance. Now not only are we back where we were, but we're back where we were with all these physical things coming at us. They're causing all these more physical emotions. And so it's a good way to be to not cause any negative karma, to just, oh, this guy punched me, big deal, I'll handle it in a very practical way. A reasonable, logical way, and I'll figure something out, whatever it may be. Maybe. And you have the satisfaction of knowing I didn't lose control physically of anything. My brain may have been on fire, you know, ironically, Nibbana. I didn't carry out that negative Kamma into the physical realm and making it more difficult for myself, you know. And in that sense, it makes— it gives you a much better position. Uh, somebody walked— says— hold on, I don't know what's happening. Give me some notification. But anyways, I don't know what I'm saying.

**Speaker C:** Oh, Scott! Hello, Scott!

**Speaker B:** Hey, Scott! What's up, gang?

**Speaker A:** Hi, Arhat.

**Speaker B:** Hi, Skov. Everyone's in here, huh? That's cool. I just joined the service.

**Speaker A:** Can't really hear you. Bye. Yeah. Hold on.

**Speaker B:** I need to charge my.

**Speaker E:** All right.

**Speaker G:** I will get going.

**Speaker C:** Going to be late.

**Speaker B:** Thanks for hanging out.

**Speaker D:** Panda.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, the results of karma are here and now. Like as Dhammarato said, if you allow it to go from internal to external, then you feel the results right now. You don't need to wait 10 lifetimes to see where you're reborn.

**Speaker G:** Kamma.

**Speaker A:** That ends kamma, right? Neither bright or dark.

**Speaker B:** I like to do art and stuff, and I had a concept for a movie and a comic. Maybe somebody will steal it. That's okay. But I think it could be beneficial. But I thought of making like a comic where the character is just a guy and he's the main character of the story, but he wakes up just kind of like born anew. It's not very original, but he just kind of wakes up and he's kind of like, huh, where am I? What's happening? And he goes throughout this village But basically, to make a long story short, he acts as the enlightened Buddha throughout the whole comic book, but every person he meets in a way is kind of new to him, but they know him personally, and they know that he's like a scoundrel, a thief, a bad guy, an egomaniac, a narcissist, the worst of the worst. But when he gets encountered with these people, like, you see him only reacting in the way of an enlightened Buddha, but they continue, some of them, to berate him with his past. And you can see that he almost— it's like he almost has amnesia. He doesn't— he's not aware of what they're saying or what they're even talking about. He could only be kind. He can only be patient. He can only think very logically and reasonably and not cause any Dukkha for himself or anybody else. And like I always say, that's when Jesus would tell people that you're forgiven no matter what they did. Oh, hold on one second. Sorry.

**Speaker E:** You guys talking about Angulimala?

**Speaker A:** No, it's a movie.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato is talking about a movie.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe, uh, I'm sure there's similar stuff, stuff like it, probably. But, but, um, but the point is, like, when Jesus would forgive people, they were so shocked that they could be forgiven for their horrible sins, they almost didn't want to accept it from Christ. So they would be in shock, like, what do you mean I'm not forgiven? And Jesus would put a mirror in front of them, in a way of speaking, and show them it's not me that you need forgiveness from, it's from yourself. And there's not really a difference between Christ and ourselves. Can we forgive ourselves? It is possible, but you have to go a step further and allow yourself that satisfaction. Just like this guy in the story, he learned to just forgive himself and move on, but it's the other people around him that just could not let it go. And maybe they end up killing him or something. Maybe, I don't know, maybe it's not an original story. There's something I was thinking about. But you see what I'm saying? It's like, it's a beautiful thing to realize every moment, like Dhammarato talks about the mind moments, one moment after another, it's another beautiful choice to choose peace and forgiveness and compassion and emptiness. And it's when you realize you have that power, it's something very, very awesome. It's available to everybody. But I'm going to go help my wife, you guys. You guys can keep talking if you want, but I'm going to get going. Much peace and love. Adios. See you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Is Mikey here?

**Speaker C:** Mikey is not here. Here. I'm going to cut this off so we can keep on talking, but I'm going to end the recording.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato's Sangha friends, is an informal, meandering discussion centered on the simplicity and practicality of Buddhist practice. The core themes are demystifying enlightenment, finding peace in the present, and applying Dhamma to everyday challenges.

**Summary of Key Themes:**

1.  **The Simplicity of Practice:** The central, recurring point is that the Dhamma path is not complicated. It's about **"not reacting,"** observing the mind and body without judgment, and letting go of the need to control or improve the present moment. As one speaker (Jonas) shared from a retreat, the realization that "there's absolutely nothing to do" and no "right or wrong" meditation can lead to profound peace.

2.  **Demystifying Enlightenment (Nibbana):** The group reframes Nibbana not as a magical or distant goal, but as the simple, always-available cooling of the mind—taking the "food off the fire" of attachment and dissatisfaction. It is equated with basic peace of mind, the ability to "remain calm" in all situations, and the satisfaction of being okay with things as they are.

3.  **Seclusion & Non-Reaction:** They discuss **isolation** (*kaya viveka*) as a valuable tool for stripping away ego and pretense, but emphasize that true seclusion is internal. The ultimate practice is maintaining inner stillness and non-reaction whether alone in a cave or in a crowded ballroom. The goal is to stop feeding "Mara" (suffering, ego) with attention.

4.  **Accepting the Human Experience:** A strong theme is the radical acceptance of all mental states. Suffering is compounded when we get angry about being angry. True practice involves accepting that the human brain will experience the full range of thoughts and emotions, and that's okay. The "Middle Way" is praised as the profound wisdom of not feeding a reaction nor suppressing it, but simply staying balanced and observant.

5.  **Practical Application in Daily Life:** The discussion grounds the Dhamma in everyday struggles:
    *   Dealing with annoying noises (a child's tablet, HVAC units, bugs).
    *   Handling difficult people (a schizophrenic online interlocutor, a stranger having a meltdown over cookies).
    *   Parenting and teaching.
    *   Facing illness and the inevitability of death, which is framed simply as "the final adventure" and as natural as breathing out.

6.  **Kamma as Immediate Cause and Effect:** Karma is discussed not as a cosmic ledger, but as the immediate, practical consequences of our actions. The emphasis is on preventing internal disturbances from manifesting as harmful external actions, which only creates more "physical" problems to deal with here and now.

**Overall Tone & Conclusion:**
The talk is warm, humorous, and digressive, touching on personal anecdotes, tech problems, and cats. The collective wisdom that emerges is a down-to-earth, demystified Buddhism: the path is about **ending dissatisfaction here and now** by choosing not to react, accepting the present, and finding a peaceful "cheat code for life" that is available to everyone in every moment. The ultimate message is one of ease, forgiveness (especially of oneself), and the profound simplicity of just being with "what is."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the conversation, here are the key metaphors and stories used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Cheat Code:** The Dhamma practice is compared to a "cheat code in life" — a simple, powerful trick that changes your entire experience of the game (life).
2.  **Video Game Rage:** Getting overly invested in emotions is likened to a friend who "flips out and loses his mind" over a video game like Mario Brothers, highlighting how we take transient things too seriously.
3.  **Feeding the Troll/Demon:** Negative mental states (Mara, demons) are compared to **internet trolls** that thrive on attention. If you don't feed them with your focus, they lose power and leave you alone.
4.  **Backseat Driver:** Advanced practice is described as moving from the **driver's seat** to the **back seat**, where you simply observe the body and mind doing their things without trying to control everything.
5.  **Taking Food Off the Fire:** Nibbana (enlightenment) is demystified using the literal Pali meaning: taking food off the fire to let it **cool down**. It represents calming the mind and ending the "heat" of craving and suffering.
6.  **The Bar/Standard:** Practice is simplified as either **setting the bar so low you hit it every time** or having **no bar at all**, emphasizing non-striving and acceptance.
7.  **Biological Adaptation:** The speaker's adaptation to his son's loud tablet noise is used as a metaphor for how **humans can adapt to anything**, and Dhamma practice speeds up and improves that adaptive process.
8.  **Life Hack/Psychological Life Hack:** The Dhamma is repeatedly framed as a practical **life hack** or **psychological tool** for ending dissatisfaction, making it accessible and non-mystical.
9.  **The Final Adventure:** Death is reframed as the **"final adventure,"** an unknown but potentially interesting next experience, reducing fear.
10. **Possession:** Becoming invested in emotions is described as a form of **possession**—you become "possessed by these demons" of your own mental states.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Ajahn Chah's Hospital Visit:** The story of Ajahn Chah visiting a sick, elderly monk (Ajahn Brahmavamso). Instead of poetic wisdom, Chah simply said, *"Well, you're either gonna live or you're gonna die. See ya."* This illustrates the direct, non-sentimental, and liberating wisdom of accepting reality.
2.  **The *Office Space* Hypnosis:** The speaker explains the core of spiritual books to a friend by referencing the movie *Office Space*. After being hypnotized, the protagonist achieves a state of detached calm: *"whatever comes your way, both good or bad, you just have to be like, all right, man, I'll just do the best I can, and whatever happens, happens."* This is presented as the essence of non-reaction.
3.  **The Forgotten Laptop Password:** A personal story about being locked out of a laptop containing "all my shit" for six months. It's used as a common, relatable example of frustration and then framed as **"a good lesson in letting go."**
4.  **Bukowski's Father:** Referencing poet Charles Bukowski, who said his father "beat the pretense out of him." This is compared to the role of **isolation** in Dhamma practice, which "beats the pretension... the ego out of you."
5.  **Tibetan Hermits:** Mentioning masters who spent **7, 10, or 15 years in isolation** to highlight the power of solitude in stripping away pretense and facing oneself.
6.  **The "First Buddhas" Debate:** A discussion about the Chinese/Asian saying that **your parents are your first Buddhas**. This story sparks debate about the nature of reverence, teaching, and how we view authority figures in practice.
7.  **The Angry Man & the Cookies:** A brief anecdote about an adult having a **meltdown in a store** over the last packets of cookies, used to illustrate how adults are essentially "big children" ruled by their cravings.
8.  **The Comic Book/Movie Concept:** The speaker shares an idea for a story about a **villain who wakes up with amnesia and behaves like an enlightened Buddha**, while everyone else confronts him with his past. This illustrates themes of **forgiveness, self-forgiveness, and living in the present moment** free from past karma.
9.  **The Bug in the Kitchen:** A personal story about **unexplainable rage at a bug** while on the phone. The teller realizes the bug was just a trigger, and the real source was pre-existing, unnoticed dissatisfaction (*dukkha*). This shows how suffering often originates internally, not externally.
10. **Jesus's Forgiveness:** Referencing **Jesus forgiving people** to make the point that profound forgiveness is about people learning to **forgive themselves**, and that the teacher (Christ/Buddha) is essentially holding up a mirror to that capacity within the person.

### **Overall Narrative Themes**
The conversation itself follows a **story arc**: it starts with a technical problem (DJ software, forgotten passwords), moves into shared personal struggles, then uses metaphors and stories to explore the Dhamma as a simple, practical solution. It culminates in a discussion of profound themes like death, forgiveness, and enlightenment, before winding down with casual, grounding talk about cats and cookies. The metaphors and stories serve to **demystify Buddhist concepts**, make them **relatable to modern life**, and emphasize **simplicity, acceptance, and present-moment awareness**.
