### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Not the company mind.

**Speaker B:** Cool, just a good old-fashioned good week.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good.

**Speaker B:** Anyone else got any highlights to share?

**Speaker C:** I got a— I got something to share. I felt like it's worth mentioning. So great, I, I finished like my contract with my job last week, uh, because I'm doing like a freelance job. And this week I end up like with no jobs, no plans, nothing to do. And one thing I realized, as much as I complained during the work, I'm now complaining when I'm not working. I'm still experiencing the same anxiety, still experiencing the same thoughts. I'm still experiencing the same things of like there's nothing to do. Even if I'm not working, there's nothing to do. Even if I'm working, there's nothing to do. So I just noticed that kind of Shift. It doesn't go away even if you switch a job, even if you go live in the happiest life. It still follows. It's still after you.

**Speaker B:** Because?

**Speaker C:** Because you're not here.

**Speaker B:** Ah, well, yeah, okay, that's one way you could take it. I was thinking because it's not about circumstances.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But you have experienced it going away. I know you have, but it's not about the circumstances, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so I'll bet in any moment that you remember to practice, Carl.

**Speaker C:** Those moments I really do remember to practice because I'm sitting here with no job and I can see it more clearly. Like, oh, you can see the uncertainty of reality like really kick in. I don't have a job. I don't have this. Oh, where am I going to get the money? Who's going to feed me? And you see all these thoughts pop up. Pile up, pile up, pile up. I'm like, why does it matter right now? Like, I'm sitting here on the sofa, can't even chill out like for a second without having these thoughts. So you almost start panicking and like looking for every possible opportunity, every possible job, what's out there, what's out there. But then you realize even that, that brings back the same anxiety as was before because you're not dealing with the source of issue. The source of issue is that you're sitting there thinking how bad things are when there is nothing going on. Just thought, just a self-created problem. And yeah, that's what I've been practicing this week with, and it's been pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty interesting.

**Speaker B:** Amazing. I love those moments where you get to see it both ways in such sharp relief. I remember a conversation I had with a Dharma friend that none of you have ever met, I don't think. His name's Chris Kerr. He's not around at the moment. Maybe he'll drop in sometime. He at the time was in a long-term relationship. I at the time was single, and we were on the phone to one another, I complaining about being single, he complaining about being in a relationship. And we said, don't— it's not about Being single or being in a relationship, is it? No, Chris, it's not. No, Danny, it's not. It's about Dukkha. It's about being dissatisfied. And when we see it that clearly, we get the cut-through. Like you said, Carl, it's a real strong reminder to practice, right? You see that— oh, what's the word? Forgive me guys, there's fatigue.

**Speaker D:** That—.

**Speaker B:** Can'T get it— but that you're dissatisfied in both scenarios tells you that it's not the scenarios. Freedom! Freedom from scenarios!

**Speaker C:** I'm seeing that as well. It's like, even if I'm sitting here with no job, and then the thoughts come out, they drive you into previous scenarios. So you're going to go back to doing same old things, same old habits. So these thoughts are like keeping you in the same loop, because you're not allowing any space for uncertainty. And that is the nature of our reality, is uncertainty. And the longer you have, the harder you resist it, the more it comes after you. So once I really settle in into and just remove the Dukkha and remove all these things, they all fall into place by themselves. As we had a conversation, I think last Wednesday, about— I mentioned washing dishes, how we don't want to wash dishes. But once you remove the thought of, oh, I have to wash dishes, and you just pick up a dish, they wash themselves automatically. So same thing with uncertainty, things, they start to fall into place once you can relax into it, right?

**Speaker B:** It's not that when things fall into place we'll be content. Rather, it's that when we're content, we stop wishing that things would fall elsewhere.

**Speaker A:** So can I ask the group a question then? And what's the role of play in all of this? You know, playfulness, making it fun, making it a game. Am I on mute still? Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** No, we can hear you. We're waving to Scott. Hey, Scott.

**Speaker D:** Hi.

**Speaker E:** Hey, good to see you.

**Speaker A:** I think it's all play. I think that's the attitude, the attitude, the attitude that this is that we're playing with meditation, and that meditation isn't work, meditation is a game that we're playing. You know, it's like, um, I like the video game analogy of where we're like shooting down the unwholesome thoughts with like our laser guns, like Space Invaders or something. Um, so I think, yeah, it's like a— it's an attitude change. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is play foreground for you right now, Tim?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm trying to connect play to acceptance. I feel like— what's the word that you'll see used in Buddhist circles and subreddits? Surrender, I think. I'm not sure about that term. That sounds serious, like a Ukrainian-Russian sort of thing. Like we're waiting on one side, like resolution of this, and that's so serious. And I think that's That's where a lot of us get caught, you know. It's this serious approach to life of, it's really going to give me what it promises. It's not going to do that, right? But I guess, you know, if you can accept that it's not going to give you that stuff, then you can start playing with it. And for me, it's more like, well, what can I play with right now, right? What's like— and I heard, I don't know who said that earlier, I like that about dishes. If I just drop the thought that I have to do the dishes, that I can play with, you know, a little fun doing the dishes.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker A:** I guess I'm trying to map out, like, how far can I take this playfulness to? And it's been fun.

**Speaker B:** I can see you with your tie around your head. Running around with your arms in the air, 'I surrender.'.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, some of that Buddhist stuff too, you come across, it's so serious. It's like you're going to take enlightenment by storm. The key phrase there, and I know Dhammarato, he's always saying, 'I don't like that term,' or, you know, it's people saying, 'We don't like that term, it's not a really good term,' but, you know, it's the coolest place in the furnace. But Lighten is right there. How do you lighten this thing up? And that's what— yeah, how do I lighten this thing up? Because it just, it turns into a 50-pound weight and it's 100-pound weight, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Hey Rick, hey, welcome.

**Speaker B:** Hey, hey, good to see you again.

**Speaker F:** Thanks.

**Speaker B:** Uh, Tim, I think this is one of the reasons we're so lucky to have Dhammarato to bring that Eastern wisdom to us Westerners and add in what we're missing. I think that the difference in the way that the East presents happiness and how it works there— I think I heard Dhammarato say one time that most Easterners are just closer to that condition of Srotapanna than we Westerners, just because the way that they understand happiness is different. It's less about scenarios, to circle back onto that. Where, yes, some of those scriptures can seem serious in tone, maybe our cultural baggage, the way that we interpret those words, has a lot to do with that, where perhaps someone in the East might already be in possession of a degree of joy anyway, abiding as they read those scriptures. Us Westerners interpret it as all so serious because that's where we're coming from.

**Speaker C:** And I don't know if any of you guys been to Thailand, but the people are more playful there. Like, you can sense the playfulness out of people. They even have like these festivals where they go and spray each other with water, like, yeah, yeah, soak each other out. And you wouldn't find that here. Like, if you spray some businessman in a suit, he's not gonna be like, haha, you got me. He's gonna be like, call my lawyer.

**Speaker B:** Tim will be fine. So of course, Dhammarato adds in that joyful flavor for us and perhaps even amplifies that beyond what we might find in the suttas to allow for our Western dryness and kind of soak us a little. Spraying us with his big Dharma water pistol.

**Speaker A:** Dhamma, what's Sokka?

**Speaker B:** What's what?

**Speaker A:** Sorry, um, Sokka.

**Speaker B:** Sokka.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Sokka, right.

**Speaker F:** Super Sokka. Mega Sokka.

**Speaker D:** It's a Pali, right?

**Speaker F:** From the original. Yeah, yeah, yeah, from the original Soka Gakkai.

**Speaker B:** It's a rare Pali word. Yes, I'm something of a scholar. Yeah, so I certainly profited from Dhammarato's inclusion of all the joy stuff, the playfulness. Um, that, that, that was certainly huge for me, and I know it's been the same for others of us who have had the good fortune to come into contact with Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Definitely, definitely for me. I feel like it's really, really essential. Yeah, I feel like it's really important. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Big time. How you been, Rick?

**Speaker F:** I've been very well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's great answers today.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, you know, it's so funny how so many people I come in contact with talk about the days of the week that they prefer. You know, they say, oh, I hate Monday, I love Friday. And I think about, I'm like, man, every day is great. Every day, it doesn't matter. I'm good on Monday, good on Friday. Saturday's okay too. Wednesday, all right. Yeah, I don't differentiate between looking forward to a particular day of the week or dreading another one. They're all equally excellent in their potential, you know. Yes, truly, truly. Yeah, so for me, yeah, it's just, it's noted based on what my digital devices tell me it is and what I know I've been scheduled to do on a particular day. But beyond the actual feel of the day, I don't really have that anymore. It's like not attached to any particular day of the week.

**Speaker B:** Right. And isn't that a more real way of moving through a week? Because the day is just a label, right? It's just a name.

**Speaker F:** Let's say being carried along through the week rather than slogging through it, like, oh, right, make it to the end of the week, and then it's just like they started over again. It's more like being carried along through it, like it's just a stream. Of this, you know, separation. And I mean, it's all arbitrary anyway, what we happen to call this particular day anyway. So they're all just days, they're all just days. This is rotation, that's all it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've long enjoyed a Monday off of worldly work, which is quite typical among musicians. In my community, so we would quite often get together on a Monday and call it Monday Funday, while of course the typical cultural position is to hate Mondays. So I was quite blessed with an early insight into how there's no reason to hate a Monday.

**Speaker F:** Other than the activity that we feel that we're losing on the weekend and now we're obligated to do on the following day. It's really about the activities within that day we've associated with a particular day. But if the activity is like, all right, it's an opportunity, it's a chance to have fun, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter at all.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker F:** Doing fine, doing fine.

**Speaker B:** Delightful. How about you, Scott? How are you, brother?

**Speaker D:** I'm good. Yeah, like, I don't even go to work. So like, I don't have it. Like, every day is the weekend to me. I work on the weekends, at least in the offseason. So like, I ref water polo. So like, I just ref a ton of games on the weekends. And like, during the week, I just wake up and I just like, I go to the park and I just walk around and then I just sit somewhere. And then I just like soak it up, or I might just play video games all day. So like today it was like nice, I just, I walked around the house for like an hour just to get like moving, get the energy going. And I highly recommend like at least once a day walking at a fast pace for at least an hour. That's important for like just from like a normal, like, just for your health. Like, if you don't exercise, you should at least walk, like walk for an hour. And also it gets you, um, if you feel like lethargic, it really like gets you up. Like, it's like taking caffeine.

**Speaker C:** So that's that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I found a kind of a buzz after a long brisk walk, right? Because it's light exercise, so you don't necessarily feel tired afterward, but everything's firing, right? There's circulation, there's the heart rate is slightly up. Yeah, yeah, I get it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and just like, uh, it gets you in your body a little bit more. Like, that's the first, um, that's how you come into your senses a little bit easier. Like, you can do it by taking deep breaths as well, um, and that kind of grounds you, and it can bring like a sense of joy. And then If you ride that joy, you can go into first Jhana, and then all you have to do is like not think unwholesome thoughts, or at least like be on guard for them. And just like when one comes up, just be like, oh, that's an awesome thought. And then you get on a roll. And then once you get on a roll, then Piti and Sukkha can come. I mean, like, I don't know if like you can do this, like if you have like stuff to do, but like I have like all day to do this. So that's all I do.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. And indeed, as we have more time to do it, distractions free, then you're probably finding, right, you can bring it into more complex activities as well, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. So like, you do— if you can do things like with a smile on your face, like, like, it takes the bite out of it. Like, I think Dhammarato said the difference between like taking the trash out and like, like bitching and moaning the whole time about it, like on the way there, is it's gonna suck. But if you're like, oh, my mom's gonna be really happy I take out the trash right now, and you get the trash and you like, you just do it step by step and you enjoy it, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Or sometimes what I'll do is I'll think about what's the most perfect way I can do this seemingly mundane activity, and it really sharpens my mind about it. Like, oh, what's the most perfect way I can cut these peppers? Not the fast way. Yeah, the Zen of it. I really get into it. What's the most perfect way I can shovel this one shovel full of snow?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** With perfect form.

**Speaker B:** I love hearing you talk about shoveling the snow, Rick. It's great because that's a real strong example of a task that would typically be resisted, right? Up at, what is it, 5:00 AM?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, 5:00 AM sometimes because that's Yeah.

**Speaker B:** In the dark, in minus what?

**Speaker F:** Minus 12, minus 15.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. So out of your warm bed, up at 5, out into the cold shoveling snow. That's just such a great little kind of hard mode practice, if you want to call it that. But of course, as soon as you get the attitude right, it's no longer hard mode.

**Speaker F:** And it's really practical too, like you're doing something that's necessary you're in a meditative state and you're actually getting some exercise. So it's actually like hitting a bunch of, checking a bunch of boxes. So that's all sweet, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's actually a sweet situation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, love it.

**Speaker B:** Hey Brandon, how are you?

**Speaker G:** Hey, I'm good.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Good, good.

**Speaker G:** Just on a lunch break at work, so figured I'd listen in.

**Speaker B:** Great, great. What's work for you?

**Speaker G:** I work at a restaurant right now, so making food.

**Speaker B:** Great, keeping people fed. Yeah, that's some good old-fashioned good karma right there.

**Speaker D:** I like your beard, man. It's like, it's pretty sweet. Pretty dope.

**Speaker A:** Thanks.

**Speaker G:** That was the goal, I guess. If you're gonna have a beard, have a pretty dope one, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's like a majestic one. Like, there's like power to the beard, you know? Like, you probably have some guru, like, mystical powers along with that.

**Speaker F:** Is that like the Air Jordans? It's the shoes. No, no, it's the beard.

**Speaker G:** I try to fly around on carpets occasionally, just, you know, it's a good thing to do for fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I think I heard Osho say one time, like, he was like, a man without a beard and mustache is like a woman with a beard and mustache. That's a pretty controversial take, but like, wow. I'm not— I don't agree with that viewpoint, but it's just like.

**Speaker G:** I will say it's been an exercise in letting go to let it grow this long. Oh yeah, I just don't— I hardly touch it at all. I just have to trim the mustache like this occasionally just because I don't like to eat my hair while I eat food that often.

**Speaker F:** It makes sense, you know, give it that flavor, that special flavor.

**Speaker G:** But I used to be like a really big perfectionist, like I always like keep my beard like really trimmed short and stuff in the same way. So it was like when I let it go, I was like really letting that old part of myself come trying to drop away too. Like always having to control everything and everything be just the exact way you.

**Speaker H:** Want it to be.

**Speaker B:** Delightful.

**Speaker A:** You've learned to just let it grow.

**Speaker G:** Let it go, let it grow, man.

**Speaker B:** Dharma and the Art of Masculine Grooming. There's a book in there.

**Speaker F:** There's a series of podcasts in there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, when everything becomes practice.

**Speaker G:** Is my background noise too high because I'm in a restaurant and there's a bit of music playing. I just wanted to make sure it's not distracting.

**Speaker B:** It's great when you're talking, we can hear you. I would say let's mute your mic when you're not talking.

**Speaker G:** When I'm not talking. Yeah, that's why I figured.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Brandon.

**Speaker G:** That's why I was muted when I first jumped in.

**Speaker B:** Cool, thanks. So who else has something to throw on the Dharma fire? Oh, I was going to mention something actually, Rick, when you were talking about the peppers. A recommendation for a wonderful documentary episode on Netflix is episode 1 of season 3 of a show called Chef's Table. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? This is an episode that normally follows restaurant chefs, but this one is different. They follow a Korean Buddhist nun.

**Speaker C:** Who.

**Speaker B:** Cooks this incredible food at her monastery, which is beautiful. I mean, the locations that they shoot are just unbelievable. And she comes to, I think it's New York, where they hang out. And I think it's either the producer or the director who's talking to the camera at the beginning, and he's talking about how the food that she serves, they would happily have served in any of the 5-star restaurants in the city, and no one would have batted an eyelid. And he said when he tried this food, he said, well, we have to go to Korea, we have to find out about this woman and shoot an episode on her. And they did, and it's just brilliant. I think you'll all enjoy it greatly.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker G:** What was the show called again?

**Speaker B:** Chef's Table.

**Speaker G:** And you said it was episode 1, season 3? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was hoping for similar stories in the other episodes, but I couldn't find any. It was all just kind of typical restaurant stuff. I didn't find any of the other episodes quite so inspiring.

**Speaker F:** They need to do like a spin-off Nun's table. Nun's table.

**Speaker B:** Nun's table.

**Speaker F:** Not yet.

**Speaker B:** Great. Come on then. Who else has got something for us?

**Speaker D:** I do.

**Speaker B:** Come on, Alex, let's hear it.

**Speaker E:** So I've been noticing some really interesting, cool shifts in my practice lately, one of which is I thought that my practice was all of life until I started practicing way more. And then I see how much my life was not practice. So like the gaps, the like the micro nano gaps are being filled with practice. Practice now. Like the times when you go to the bathroom and you realize your mind is wandering, oh, there it is. Or you're like, you're getting the butter out of the fridge to put in the pan, oh, whoop, there it is. You know, little things like that. It's like, whoa, everything is getting immersed in mindfulness. And what is so amazing about it is that my aversion and not liking of the content and the phenomena has gone way down. Like, the buzz has been killed in that aversion. It's like, I mean, sometimes it's there, but it's just like, oh, there it is, you know. It's like, okay, let's start again. And the never mind, start again has never been so clear. Like, I think when I started with Dhammarato and then when I started doing TWIM I got really like fascinated with like being in the jhanas and like staying in the jhanas and sustaining the jhanas. But I noticed like as long as I'm fascinated in like sustaining those kinds of states, when I'm not in them, right, when I'm going to the toilet or when those moments are happening where the mind is wandering, it's going to be so disappointing. It's going to be such a problem. So I've started to see the ways in which my mind will do this and hang on to things, right? So I've started to like just let go of even being in Jhana, like just let go of even like getting anything right. Like every moment is a new moment and that's the moment to start again and again and again and again and again and again. And And the more and more I've done that, I've seen that it's all a habit. It's all habitual patterns, repetition. It has nothing to do with— I wouldn't even say it has anything to do with effort even. It has a mind of its own that those habits have been going on themselves for a while. So now it's just surrendering. It's just letting go in each moment to those habits and practicing correctly. And that's all I can really do. So now it's like, am I in Jhana? Am I not in Jhana? Well, if I'm in Jhana, great. If I'm not in Jhana, great. You know, like, and then, you know, then the Jhanas will come, but it's like, it's really cool. It's, I don't care as much about any of it. And I think that's the way to go. Because caring about it has been such a drawback for me. Like, I'll get really great results with all my, like, persistence and effort, but then I'll want that again. So it's like, let's just, let's just let it all go.

**Speaker B:** And does the letting go of wanting to be in Jhana do anything to the likelihood of being in Jhana?

**Speaker E:** I'd say yes, usually. Yeah, it's— go ahead.

**Speaker H:** In what way?

**Speaker E:** Well, sometimes like today, right? The mind has been— it'll like, it'll wander, and then I'll accept that. Let go, relax into it, start again, smile, you know, have the wishing of loving kindness, of love for myself or for my spiritual friend. And then it'll do it again, and it'll go back, and it'll do it again, and I'll go back. And sometimes, honestly, I'm not actually sure if I'm in Jhana right now or out of Jhana, because Jhana has become, I would say, so like naturally there, naturally present. So I actually don't even know. It's at a point where there's less distinction between the states. Now when it goes really high into Jhana, which happens when I do distraction-free sitting practice, which can happen really quickly, there's like a subdued everything. It's like everything is like so calm and relaxing, but the distinction from what I'm at now to that is very, very small. It's noticeable, but it's very small. So does that help?

**Speaker B:** I wish I had my little party.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's crazy.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, the jhanas are less. Is that kind of how it can go, Dan, that the jhanas become less of a difference, of a distinction?

**Speaker B:** You tell me.

**Speaker E:** That's how it's felt. Of course, I can't know for sure because it's my experience. Does that line up with your experience or anybody else's here?

**Speaker B:** That lines up with my experience, but your experience is far more important than mine in this case.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I had a similar thing happen, but not to interrupt you, Scott. I had to say to Alex, I had a similar thing happen a couple weeks ago where the space between satisfied and dissatisfied seemed to get more subtle, I think. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** What were you gonna say, Scott?

**Speaker B:** Right, go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker D:** Okay, so something you're talking about just like made me think of Jhana is like a beautiful woman who's just like completely like just like naturally joyful and attractive. Like if you're clinging at all, like they're not going to want to be around you. Like you have to be like totally like just chill. Like, just chilled out. You— not— don't, don't call her all the time. Stop texting, okay? Jhana.

**Speaker F:** Jhana is just not that into you. Yeah, it's pronounced Jane.

**Speaker G:** I think another I think another way you can say it is like satisfaction breeds more satisfaction and dissatisfaction is the seeking of higher satisfaction or more satisfaction in the first place. When you're in that place, that dissatisfied state is more likely to create more dissatisfaction in the future, you know, if you let it continue. So It's kind of like a balance between being satisfied with the way things are, but then also doing some practice when it feels right to like keep it up. I was— I just had a talk with Dhammarato a couple nights ago where I was asking him, I was like, yeah, my life seems to be pretty smooth sailing these days. Like I haven't been I'm not doing as much practice. Like, what do you say to that? Like, what should I do? And he told me it was something like, I should try to focus on having like, maybe 20 or 30 little Nibbana moments a day. And he gave me these really cool instructions of like, when I open doors, like, take a pause, 'What's so important that I need to even go through this door?' Or getting out of a car door. And he gave a bunch of other, like, little moments in the day to, like, introduce practice, like when you do these activities as, like, a guaranteed way to kind of keep the ball rolling enough to where you're not, like, losing any, you know, progress and stuff. I don't know, it was pretty cool.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like that helped me a lot that Dhammarato like made it more relatable because there's like moments that you have little mini little Nibbana like all the time. Otherwise you go crazy, right? Like when you— one time he said like when you sit down at a restaurant, like right when you sit down in your table and you just like relax like, oh, I'm at a restaurant now. That little moment like you're like— Yeah.

**Speaker G:** He told me that with sitting down. Like when you sit down, like pause, like right before you sit and then just like take a deep breath and then sit down and really enjoy that taking a load off, like feeling that comes when you get to sit down after you've been up for a while.

**Speaker D:** Or I have another one, like, like think about like when you first walk into a grocery store and you're like, oh, now I'm in a grocery store. It's just like there's that moment you have that like split second of just like, look at all this stuff. Like I'm in a grocery store, like, like.

**Speaker E:** I know exactly what you're talking.

**Speaker D:** About, Scott, because like, like one time I was tripping on LSD and like I walked into a grocery store and I noticed it like way more. I'm like, like, it's like.

**Speaker F:** The change. The bananas, the bananas.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker E:** I don't know if you've ever had this, but it's like, like you go to the grocery, there's all these aisles, and then there's like people too, and everything— you look so tall. Everything, like you look so tall, like you're looking down at everything, like almost like it's a bird's eye view kind of experience.

**Speaker B:** You mean you had that experience?

**Speaker E:** That's frequently how it feels when I go into grocery stores.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker F:** It's really easy to find stuff that way, right? If you're looking down. I think about that if it's on.

**Speaker D:** The bottom of Target even more so, like, because Target, they have Legos and they have like video games and stuff at Target and like, like funny t-shirts and stuff. And like, dude, girls love Target. Like, I've never met a girl that didn't like Target. Huh. But like, they're always at Target, man. Like, Target's where it's at.

**Speaker B:** Do you remember reaching the age when you were allowed to hang out in the toys section by yourself while mom or dad went off and did the groceries?

**Speaker F:** I was never that old. I was never that old.

**Speaker C:** That was the last memory.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You never let me go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I'll just hang out here in the video game section, Mom. You go do the boring shit.

**Speaker E:** The other thing I've noticed is that— oh, sorry, go ahead, Dan.

**Speaker B:** I was just going to comment on what you mentioned, Scott, about when you enter the grocery store, that moment, and how of course that kind of thing is seems to be heightened on LSD, but then we discover, of course, don't we, that actually it's a subtractive thing, that we're just not doing all of that networking that says, "Oh, this is normal." With practice, we just open everything up, open everything up, open everything up, and that conditioning falls away. Then we can walk into the grocery store and this fucking wild. How did all this get together in one place? Like, there's the bananas, right? But there's also fucking dates and almonds and sugar snap peas and hummus and all this shit from all over. Like, it's a mad experience.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it is.

**Speaker B:** It's actually mad.

**Speaker F:** And the seasonal products— don't forget the seasonal products.

**Speaker B:** Seasonal products.

**Speaker D:** Somehow.

**Speaker F:** The flavors of summer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, but I mean, but we call them seasonal products. The strawberries obviously go mad here in the UK in summer, but there's strawberries there all year round. You can get strawberries, they're just not as good. So even seasonal products, that whole seasonal thing has somehow lost its meaning. We've managed to engineer shit to the degree that we can just have exactly what we want whenever we want. And that is a crazy experience. And it's in this super controlled, super comfortable environment. The Strawberries Go Mad.

**Speaker F:** Fantastic band name. Fantastic name for a band.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, The Strawberries Go Mad. Or it's— the band is called The Strawberries, of course, and the album is The Strawberries Go Mad.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or is their first full-length feature film— anyway, it's being in a supermarket is trippy as fuck all by itself, right? And when we stop doing all of that stuff in here that normalizes it.

**Speaker D:** Oh, okay. Yeah, there's that. There's that too. But then there's also that, um, like that little release, that little, like, maybe like you were thinking about something, like you're like in some sort of like unwholesome train of thought, and that moment you walk in the grocery store, you're like, okay, now I'm in a grocery store, this is what I'm doing. So there's that little moment of relief.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** So like, I'm trying to explain like that little like feeling of like expansion where like you're contracted, like tripping out about something where it's like something so completely ordinary can bring about just like, like hit of peace. And that little hit, that little hit of peace is like how you go all the way to Nirvana. Like that's literally like the release of like Dukkha, that's satisfaction. So like, the more familiar you become with it, like the more you can go back to it because like, you know what it's like.

**Speaker C:** Wakey wakey. That's how it sounds. Wakey wakey.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. The ordinariness factor is a big deal there, right? That Nibbana can be found in something so ordinary as that little change.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and then also another way to think about it is like Nibbana is the most ordinary thing that can happen to you. So sorry.

**Speaker C:** Can someone mute them?

**Speaker B:** I can see like a lot of noise. Yeah, it's me. Debbie's boiling the kettle.

**Speaker D:** Oh, okay, no worries. Okay, so yeah, it's so ordinary. Everything else like your whole life has been the weird thing, like suffering is the weird thing. And like it's been trip, you've been on a like crazy trip of like going through like hell as a person and like being dissatisfied. And then when Nibbana comes, you're like, oh, this is, or this is the natural state, this is ordinary. So there's nothing mystical or special about like satisfaction. It's not some like, oh, the clouds are gonna part and God's gonna come down from the sky and like say, congratulations, you did it, like here's your mystical powers.

**Speaker F:** You're the millionth, you're the millionth customer.

**Speaker D:** The millionth enlightened person. It's so ordinary that like people like almost will be disappointed by it and like say, oh, this can't be it, and then I keep looking. So it's like, yeah, yeah, right there.

**Speaker A:** It'S like the magicalness Like, I get that a lot. Like, I'll make myself dissatisfied because my Jhana isn't like magical enough, it's not trippy enough. Like, there's still a sense of self, you know? Like, all this— the no-self is like the main thing because that's like a big like spiritual like marketing thing where it's like, you know, you— it's about no-self. It sounds so cool on paper and stuff, and it's like, and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah. And now I'll be like in Jhana, and then I'll be like, oh, but, but this— but where's my no-self facet? You know, like, where's my this facet of awakening?

**Speaker D:** Right?

**Speaker A:** So it's like I kind of spoil it for myself doing that.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha.

**Speaker F:** Look how— yes, and that's how cool it is on paper.

**Speaker G:** You think that when you look to the things that are more satisfying, you know?

**Speaker D:** Or hey, do you guys— are you guys familiar with that one episode of SpongeBob where SpongeBob becomes really normal and he's just like Well, like anyways, the episode is like SpongeBob becomes so normal that like it drives Squidward crazy to how normal he is. And it's just like, hi, wonderful weather we're having. And it's kind of disappointing. Like if you meet, like when you meet a real teacher, like they have like good jokes and like little tools in their bag and tricks and stuff. But then like, when they go back, like when they're not talking to you, like they're just a normal person.

**Speaker F:** They're just in the grocery store, man. In the grocery.

**Speaker D:** Store.

**Speaker F:** Dan, I like that you couldn't see it because you're not supposed to see it. It's no self.

**Speaker C:** A little bit.

**Speaker F:** Yeah. See what I did there?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, very tough.

**Speaker A:** I see what you did there. Yeah, I spoke to someone and he said that like, and I feel like this is such a trend with spiritual teachers, is it's always like people ask this and this experience and the teacher says it's just an experience, you know, it's just like, it's just like it's fluff, it's not the essence, you know, the essence is stop thinking about it, stop meditating. If you're thinking about your previous experience, you're not meditating, you know. And that's not just Dhammarato, that's like every teacher that says that. And I talked to one guy and I asked him like specifically outright, I was like, you know, everyone says that these like mystical experiences aren't important, but they feel important, they feel super profound when I'm in them. I feel like I've been touched by God. Like, you're telling me this isn't important? And he said like, it's not that it's not important, but it's like this spiritual equivalent of like playing with your dick. It's just for fun, you know. It's like, it's not the meat, it's not the edge of the thing. It's like the gravy. Is it like— yeah, they're like Mahayanas and stuff like that.

**Speaker F:** Is it called Jonibbation?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** I was gonna say that when I, um, whenever I notice like what you said, Robert, how there's a tendency to look at the Jhana I'm in or the experience I'm having and be like, wait, I want more of this, or like, there should be more, there should be something else. That right there, all that is, is pointing to why it's not the way I want it to be, because I want it to be some other way. It's the craving. The craving is the entire problem. If there was ever any problem, it's the craving. That's all it is. That's what I'm starting to see. The cessation of craving is really all we're looking for in every moment. And that's huge when you can see that you're just sparring with craving every moment. You're like, oh, I see you, I got you, I got you. And all your experience, most of my experience, I've seen how much of it is shaped by craving. It's crazy.

**Speaker F:** Crazy.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker F:** Now if only there was a truth that was related to that.

**Speaker H:** Maybe what if there's good craving and bad craving?

**Speaker E:** No.

**Speaker D:** I'm not staying up for that today.

**Speaker B:** What do you mean, Ryan?

**Speaker H:** So good craving is wanting to meet your friends, wanting to be a— trying to learn from your mistakes, paying your bills, paying your taxes so you don't get fucked down the line.

**Speaker A:** Well, Dhammarato, these are simple things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, babies, strong aversion to newborn children. Dhammarato said one time that the Buddha himself said that there is such a thing as wholesome desire, such as desire to practice, desire to have wise friends and wise teachers. And we're talking about that fourth kind of karma, of course, the karma that ends karma, right? We want to go towards that, and it is a kind of wanting that leads to the end of wanting.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's sketchy, man. That sounds real sketchy to me. It sounds like you're tiptoeing on like a fine line with like spikes.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is, isn't it? And it's been called a narrow path.

**Speaker A:** Narrow path, exactly, exactly.

**Speaker C:** It's a skill to be developed because it's wisdom. Once you know where you're being attached to— oh, I'm attached to meeting my friends, I need to meet my friends— that's attachment. Then having, having skillful thought, oh, I would like to meet my friends, but I don't need them. You're navigating in the correct thought process. Like, that's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker H:** I think that's what Dan says. Dan says the difference between wanting and liking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, which is all Dhammarato. I can't take credit for that one. And he'll pass it on to the Buddha, and you know, up the line it goes, up the chain of command.

**Speaker G:** I have a question. So we just talked about like a way to end karma or somehow change it or reduce it. What does that look like in practice when it actually happens?

**Speaker B:** So when we practice, that's an action that leads to no more action. We practice and we're no longer reaching out and grabbing things or pushing things away. We're not doing things that are going to lead to something else. We're freeing ourselves from the bonds of cause and effect, so to speak. When we're practicing, we're not entering into messy relationships, we're not stealing things, we're not murdering people. Morality in simple terms. That would be the kind of ordinary way that this is taught, would be morality. And when we're sat in meditation, as Dhammarato says, that's the only time actually that we have perfect morality— when we're sat on our asses with our mouths shut. So that's what the Buddha means by the karma that ends karma— acts that don't lead to more acts, stuff that doesn't lead to more stuff.

**Speaker C:** And just stop it. Just stop. I mean, that when I hear that, it just means stop it. Just stop. Stop it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, it's all describable in one word: stop. If you can see it, you can see it. Another thing is I wanted to say is like, there can be put a lot of intention on stopping the karma, but There was never any control in moving towards this meditation process, I don't know, for me. You can claim that you were suffering and then eventually you decided to take control of this wheel and end the suffering, but who are you to say that you navigated the car into the yard for you to be able to take the wheel? I don't know if that makes sense. Who are you to say that you created this car and now you're taking the wheel. Maybe the car was always there put for you to see, but we never— I don't know how to explain this, but it doesn't seem like it's something you took control of. So whenever we talk about karma and ending all of the karma, I don't think there's any control in that. It just happens authentically and naturally by itself once you stop individually, like on the individual level. Once we stop, there's something stops overall, like the whole— right.

**Speaker B:** And that's a lovely simple way to say it, right? And, and yeah, when we get into conversations about karma, it all gets a little flowery, right? So I like that, that simple explanation. I suspect that teaching on karma might have been given to folks who were already subscribing to a model of karma. I know when Dhammarato brings up those four kinds of of karma, it's often in response to ideas around two kinds of karma. The idea of good and bad karma predated the Buddha by a long way, but he came along and said, actually, there's this mixed karma and there's then the karma that ends karma as well, which is altogether more of an explanation than we need most of the time. So stop.

**Speaker C:** Beautiful.

**Speaker B:** Stop. I love that. I found that very useful as a direction for myself at times.

**Speaker C:** Once you see any kind of going, then you just know to stop. Like, as we talked, like, the practice gets to a point where It shrinks down from a couple of words, as Dhammarato talked about it. First of all, there's like, you can sum up practicing to Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, and then eventually just becomes stop because you can see it going. You can see the wheel slowly starting to turn and you can just push the brakes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Don't even turn the wheel.

**Speaker B:** Cheers, Brandon.

**Speaker C:** See you, man.

**Speaker E:** Hi, Brandon.

**Speaker B:** And yet, of course, that doesn't mean we don't pay our taxes. Right, so we still— we do what must be done, and we come full circle to where we started this evening with you still do the dishes, but you're not really doing them. You're more in that passenger seat, so to speak. The dishes are to be done, and so you enjoy playing with the bubbles. You had something, Robert?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I wanted to say I like, I like he said stop and he didn't say stop and go in this direction. So don't like, it wasn't stop and then this, it was just stop. Like, I like the one-stepness of it. I feel like having two steps is like, when you're doing the first step, you're thinking about the second, you're anticipating the second, you know. It's like stop and now I gladden the mind, but you know, then you never really get to the second step, like, if you're anticipating it. So I like just one, like the one thing, you just stop and then you're left and you're just like, oh, what do I do now? And there's like a feeling sometimes for me like of some unknowing or some confusion and it's like I don't know what to do. But then like if you just rest in that, it's kind of like, it's, I don't know, it's sort of, I don't want to say, yeah, I don't know, but it's like an, it's like a, it can be enjoyable.

**Speaker C:** It's sort of like no self, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like a sustainable enjoyment. I feel like if you're just being satisfied with confusion or not knowing itself, that's about as sustainable as it gets. That's pretty ever-present.

**Speaker B:** I suspect that you're able to stop more of what's going on now than you were when you started practice, right? And so we would assume that that trajectory is going to continue until at some point you're able to stop that confusion that you're left with as well. Says even more stopping until everything stops. Everything. I mean, mental fabrication, let's say.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's good. That's a good point. You know what's crazy? When you said that, I realized like I'm actually playing an active role in the confusion. Like before, I always think like confusion's like my default. When I don't do anything, I'm in this like confused kind of like when you finish a Zen koan and you're just kind of dazed, you're like, what? Like that's like my kind of default state of being. And I was like, well, you know, I just have to get used to this. But that's like what I'm now thinking. What if I'm playing a role in that? What if I'm creating that?

**Speaker B:** And like, well, is confusion our default state? That's the hypothesis.

**Speaker A:** That's— I'm going to take this one onto the cushion later tonight. That's brilliant. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** In a meditative way.

**Speaker G:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Come on.

**Speaker B:** To the cushion.

**Speaker C:** I kind of just want to point out a trap of like stop as well. Stop can be a trap as in a sense people think that the unwholesomeness will stop coming once we mean stop, then you think, oh, there's no process at all. There's nothing happening. Everything just stops. That's not what we mean by stop. Stop means as soon as you see the car slowly riding down, you stop, and the car will start riding down the hill again. So you stop again and stop again and stop again until the car hits the flat, and maybe then you don't have to do as much stopping. But maybe you will go another hill down, downhill, and then you have to stop again. So I think it's important to make that distinction because I've been trapped in this like stopping all the whole— I want the wholesome thoughts to stop completely. That's what I understood previously from stopping the mind. It's just stopping it completely, but that was not the case because it always moves in cycles anyway. So you will probably need to push the brakes sometimes more, sometimes less.

**Speaker B:** Beautiful analogy. Good. How you doing, Ryan? How you been?

**Speaker H:** I'm really, really good.

**Speaker F:** Good.

**Speaker A:** All going well, no complaints.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I could tell by your genuine smile, brother. Delightful.

**Speaker H:** Things have been good. Things have been good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good, good, good.

**Speaker B:** Any highlights?

**Speaker H:** Any highlights? I fell into Anicca. £48,000 windfall today.

**Speaker C:** Woo!

**Speaker B:** Hell yeah!

**Speaker H:** So that's congratulations. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Very nice.

**Speaker H:** Uh, I started a 90-day NoFap thing a couple of days ago, so I want to see how that goes. I got to around 78 days before and I want to see whether the NoFap superpowers are the real thing or a group delusion.

**Speaker B:** What did you find at 78 days?

**Speaker H:** I thought it was true. I thought I had superpowers, but then I can be full of shit. No. So looking back, I thought, no, I was full of shit. I was fooling myself. I just stepped into the group delusion. So now I'm going to go in with an extra critical mind.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe, but you're the leading authority on your direct experience.

**Speaker H:** I'm also full of.

**Speaker G:** Shit.

**Speaker B:** I suppose then you're the leading authority on your being full of shit.

**Speaker H:** Exactly, exactly. No, I think a lot more people probably think I have a lot more accurate idea of my full of shittiness than I am.

**Speaker F:** But yeah, I remember from the last time.

**Speaker A:** It's been a while. There you go. Yes, Ryan. Ryan, I'm really glad you brought up that point of not knowing if it's a real superpower or if it's just like a placebo, like you're just tricking yourself. Yeah, that's really huge for me. Two days ago I read a PDF like twice through that Alex sent me. It was Guide to Transcendental Wisdom Insight Meditation. By, um, I can't remember the guy's name, um, but Bhante— yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and there was some really interesting detail in which I'd never actually done with Metta, and that was to imagine that the person I was, um, like radiating this loving kindness towards, I had to imagine that they— and, and not just imagine but actually take on this belief during the meditation that it was actually improving their life and they were actually going to feel this. So I was sending this, this energy from here, and this real person would really feel it, which of course, like, material science would say this is complete hocus-pocus, my materialist skeptic brainwashing, which I actually found out was basically a dogma after doing this, because it was so hard for me to drop this belief that this isn't how it works, this isn't how it really works. And I was like, look, I've supposed to have control over my mind. I should be able for an hour, for the period of this meditation, to just take on a new belief system. Why am I so afraid of doing that? And I finally was able to. And, um, uh, the, the result it produced was way better than all my other method meditations. Because like, when I feel like I'm sending loving kindness and it's just futile and it's just a silly feel-good exercise, even if that's just a thought in the back of my mind, it totally puts like, um, like a glass ceiling on, on how much that loving kindness can go. And when I was able for just a couple moments to remove that and actually take on the belief that this is really working, wow, my loving kindness shot through the roof, and it was incredible. But like, for me, that whole experience of like wrestling with my belief systems and stuff and trying to take on this new spiritual belief system, it was really, um, that, that was like at the forefront of my mind, was, is this a real like superpower, or is this just like me tricking myself? The result of believing it was a real power made it so much more effective that now, like, in the days that have been following— because I haven't really tried meditation again, I mean, I did, but I wasn't able to actually overcome my skeptic materialistic brainwashing and stuff— but I was like, like, wow, this really makes a difference. And so, like, I'm not 100% sure either, but I feel like something can be said for, like, just, like, believing in, like, magic. Like, because The results spoke for themselves, man. Like, it felt— it was a crazy meditation. It felt really powerful.

**Speaker H:** So today, yesterday, I spoke to a demon of the Goetia before I sent this email across asking. And so that's how I feel I got the— I got the £48,000, which is around $60,000 to $65,000. Because I spoke to the demon of the Gua Sha and he said it's a done deal. And they got another 12% increase in my annual salary for the future. So I do believe in magic, that it does work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. One of the things that's scary for me as well is like it sort of opens up a whole area of like spiritual research that I've been really ignoring because I was thinking this is BS. Great, I can ignore it. Let me focus on the stuff that's like scientifically like proven, like thinking wholesome thoughts, right? Because it seems more scientific. We have like studies that show people have less like stress or like cortisol or whatever if they meditate or do mindfulness and stuff. But it's like opening up this thing to like spirit possession. Like I heard some woman on a podcast today was talking about like how she communicated with plants and stuff, and I was like, I find it so difficult to believe that stuff. But the potential of believing in that stuff to actually like transform my life in real ways, whether or not if these energies even do things for other people, or if it's any of it's real. But like the potential is like crazy of like taking on new beliefs. Like it seems like a— it's like—.

**Speaker H:** I've bought courses that have taught me how to speak to plants, how to give plants different levels of energy, so I can go to a field and if it's got 3 sides or 4 sides, I can give one side energy, and I feel that this side is greener than the other two sides. And when I give energy to this side, feel like these two sides are greener than this side.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the question that's in the air here, guys, is what is real? What do we mean when we say real?

**Speaker C:** Do we mean.

**Speaker A:** Verifiable?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Well, I just said like the what is real question, like it's not just like a silly like pontification, like it's not just like skeptical like philosophizing like sophistry, like it's like it has implications, you know, so it's kind of important. I just want to add that.

**Speaker H:** Right, but I feel it's helpful to have two different ideas at the same time, completely opposite ideas at the same time, and have them both be right. It can be because I can believe in a God. You can believe there's no God and they're two completely different ideas. But who's to say that we are both wrong? So in the same way, we can say that there is no reality, that there's non-duality, there's no self. But this is Ryan speaking to Dan, Robert, Alex, DJ, Karl, and Rick. So this is us having a conversation. So we have to hold those two ideas completely in mind.

**Speaker B:** Well, I don't think that the Buddhist notion of no-self would cancel out any notion of an interpersonal interaction.

**Speaker H:** But if I saw the Buddha today and I— yeah, of course.

**Speaker D:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Can I say something about NoFap, bro? I mean, it's interesting you brought it. I've been there, done that, and one thing I noticed is when you stop doing something, you become really aware about how it used to control you. So what you're doing is just you're noticing specific Dukkha thoughts that are related to sex, wanting, craving, and then you're just removing them. That's all you're doing in NoFap. So why don't you do that with the rest of your thoughts that are not helpful to you? Why are we selectively seeking for these thoughts that we want to gain something out of? Like, especially with NoFap, you're selecting a process. You can throw all of your thoughts out. You don't have to selectively just pick, oh, okay, I don't want to watch porn. I don't want to masturbate.

**Speaker A:** All right, general.

**Speaker F:** It's a general and specific subtraction.

**Speaker C:** Yes, right. Become really good at noticing. And if you become really good at noticing and throwing it out, of course you're gonna gain superpowers. But because before you were just craving and wanting, so you're gonna notice more, you're gonna see more.

**Speaker H:** I don't think, I don't think Maybe I don't think— see, it sounds like you think that I've got sex on my mind and I've got NoFap and all that. This was just me having— I was just fapping once a day, once in 2 weeks, once a week. Sometimes I'd be doing it every day. It's just 5 or 10 minutes at night before going to sleep.

**Speaker F:** Show us the calendar, Ryan. Wow. It got real deep, Ryan. Real quick.

**Speaker E:** Let's see the calendar.

**Speaker C:** Okay, that's not it.

**Speaker H:** I mean, so, so, so now, so, so now I left to think about, uh, no, see, see, so, so what's happening is that I wasn't thinking about sex. I wasn't even craving sex. It was minimal, minimally affecting my life. But I just thought that it's getting in the way of me maybe having relationships, maybe opening my mind and the dopamine as a distraction mechanism. So it's opening my mind to maybe what's really happening in my life. And to see whether there's sadness that I'm covering up with this, loneliness that I'm covering up with this, being full of shit that I'm covering up with this and just seeing if it really—.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well done, point on. That's exactly what I meant.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** But you look at the superpowers, I mean, to the craving, I mean, to the craving about get— trying to get something, that's back to craving again, right? If it's just exchanging one for another. Oh, I will give this up to get something else. But in both situations, your hand is grasping something. Your mind is clinging to something. Right?

**Speaker H:** And that's what I talk about wholesome desire is that I feel that wholesome desire is maybe being porn-free or NoFap or anything like that. And that unwholesome is being, is It's with porn or fapping or things like that.

**Speaker C:** The question is, can you fap skillfully?

**Speaker F:** That is the question of the hour.

**Speaker H:** So Rick, talk about what you said about fapping skillfully.

**Speaker F:** Carl said that. I was seconding. I was seconding. I was offering support.

**Speaker A:** Alex?

**Speaker F:** Yeah?

**Speaker A:** You did the same meditation I did with Twim. Did you? Yeah. What was your experience? Were you able to like drop that belief that this is like just all in your head and really believe that it was actually doing something in real life?

**Speaker E:** Oh, are you talking about where like your neighbors might feel it down the street?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** I just— so I have a good friend, Corbin, as well, and he went pretty far with this. He had like a teacher for like 3 years intimately working with him on twin, and he just— he'll say sometimes he's like, the twin people think of this, but you know, this is my experience, and I tend to trust his experience because it's just, I don't know, even if it did radiate happiness to the neighbor, what is that really going to do for me right now in my experience? What matters is my relief, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Me was like, when I had this, this like, this like limiting belief that was like partially conscious, where it was like, this isn't really doing anything, um, it stopped me from feeling as good as if I believed it was. If you believed you could actually like energy blast someone to like feel amazing, like, like if you actually believed it, like, I'm pretty sure you'd feel like, like, whoa, I can just sit here and I can make this person feel amazing, like, and I can make them really— I can really make a difference in their life just sitting here meditating, like Like, if you actually take on that belief like the instructions say to, like, for me it made me feel amazing. Like, it, like, it was like loads.

**Speaker E:** Of, like, well, I don't— wait one sec, Ryan. I just want to respond to that. So I don't think it's actually what they're suggesting is to, like, take on a belief. They might have said believe, but.

**Speaker D:** Um.

**Speaker E:** How I've interpreted it or understood it.

**Speaker A:** Is.

**Speaker E:** You're like wishing that loving kindness, that feeling that you first bring up for yourself, and then once you're in touch with it, you gently nudge it along by wishing loving kindness for your spiritual friend or your family member, whatever.

**Speaker H:** But you're actually wishing well-being on them. You're wishing for their well-being.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, for the well-being. Yeah, they say loving kindness. It's similar. I think it's the same thing.

**Speaker F:** Well, it's just words.

**Speaker C:** Language.

**Speaker E:** It's that spirit of loving kindness or well-being or equanimity, whatever it is, joy, orgasm, whatever you want to say. It doesn't matter as long as it feels good, as long as you bring up that good feeling and that starts riding a momentum. That's all that matters. It doesn't really matter what the content of it is as much as what's actually happening in your experience.

**Speaker H:** I've done TWIM. I've done TWIM with the work colleague. I've done retreat. I've done 2 retreats on TWIM.

**Speaker D:** Nice.

**Speaker H:** 2 10-day retreats. And I felt really good on the retreats. And when I was doing the TWIM, I was in tears almost all day long because of of the good feelings I was having. And I was thinking about a work friend the first time I was doing it, and, uh, but he was having a shit time. His house was in difficulties. He was just going through a rough patch at that time. So I don't know whether— and I wanted to tell him, you know what, I like you, so you're a good guy, so I thought I'd— this thing. But I thought if he knew it happened at that time, he'd tell me, no, listen, just do it towards somebody else. So it was different from the experience that I was having. I mean, I was thinking, okay, man, I'm— and I believe I can send these feelings across like that, that I thought his life would be better. But practically looking at it.

**Speaker D:** It wasn't. Well, there you go.

**Speaker B:** Lawsuit waiting to happen.

**Speaker F:** Yes, yes, Your Honor, I was energy blast in from loving kindness. No, it was well-being.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, he fucked up.

**Speaker A:** He sent me the wrong energy.

**Speaker E:** This isn't what I got on my order.

**Speaker F:** Okay, so Robert, time experiment time. So you send it, send out whatever to each one of us throughout the week, and we'll report on it next week.

**Speaker B:** Better still, let's do it right now, and whoever gets blasted has to raise their hand.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker E:** All right, all right, let's do it.

**Speaker H:** No, no, they totally took class.

**Speaker B:** This is a science class. What's, what's important here and what's in the air is if you have some experience as you're doing this, then that is what's real.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker H:** Perception is reality.

**Speaker D:** What?

**Speaker B:** Say again, right?

**Speaker H:** Perception is reality. Perception is reality, but the map is not the territory.

**Speaker A:** So, Dhammarato, are you saying believe whatever, like, whatever craziness leads to, like, the best results in our experience? Because the best results for me was the magical.

**Speaker B:** I'm trying to listen to Robert. Sorry, again please, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Um, are you saying believe whatever leads to the best result, even if it is magical?

**Speaker B:** There's nothing magical about it. You're doing something in the mind which is leading to a result.

**Speaker F:** Super, right?

**Speaker B:** Super, super mundane.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, not magical.

**Speaker H:** The definition of magic is the art of getting an effect in conformation with will. So any effect in conformation with what you want, and that can be anything.

**Speaker E:** Interesting.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. That's really cool. Yeah, then that's like we're doing like magic on ourselves all the time because we're like— all the time, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, so then what I realized is that there's no concept of self-control, because there's no concept of self-control because there's no self to control. Because if the thing that we think is behind us is just can move fluidly, we think around the environment. So then I thought the way this happens is maybe from a top-down process. So we think instead of trying to do the self-control thing, we think about controlling it from our thoughts. And so if you see the problems that we have in our lives, they are all related to our thoughts that we are having. And there are questions like, why am I so fat? Why am I so full of shit? Why am I thinking that Rick's such an amazing handsome guy?

**Speaker B:** So it's all these all the time.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** I'll take funny over handsome.

**Speaker H:** So, so I suppose what happens is that— so recently I read this theory is that instead of having affirmations, there's a different way to do these things, is to ask why. So which is, why am I such a sexy motherfucker? And when you start saying that repeatedly to yourself, it comes true, even more powerfully than affirmations. Because affirmations, you don't believe. Affirmations you don't believe, which is, I'm sexy, I'm sexy, I'm sexy. You won't believe. But if you say, why am I so sexy, then it's interesting.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. You like— it's like you like— it's like you subvert like your own self.

**Speaker C:** To like— yeah, yeah, sounds like wholesome.

**Speaker D:** Thoughts to me.

**Speaker F:** Keep sharing that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I might try that. That's awesome.

**Speaker F:** How do I subvert myself? How do I say?

**Speaker A:** Why am I so satisfied?

**Speaker F:** Why am I so subvertive of myself? You get really grammatically complex.

**Speaker E:** Why am I so satisfied right now?

**Speaker B:** Why am I so satisfied right now?

**Speaker C:** Why is everything nice? That's so good.

**Speaker H:** Why am I so free of craving?

**Speaker F:** Why am I in the present moment?

**Speaker E:** Yes, why am I free of craving? Why do I feel so good?

**Speaker H:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Why am I fucking all these.

**Speaker A:** Bitches?

**Speaker F:** Are you holding a dog?

**Speaker E:** Uh-oh, Dan's gonna get the doghouse for that one.

**Speaker F:** He has plushies being chucked at him from off camera.

**Speaker B:** This is one of my bitches.

**Speaker H:** Good save, good save. Poor save, poor save, actually. Poor save.

**Speaker F:** Apparently there's a protest over there on Dan's side.

**Speaker H:** So now, now the thing is, Dan's got wholesome craving, which is how do I stay alive.

**Speaker C:** Or how do I.

**Speaker E:** Piss off my wife?

**Speaker B:** I know exactly how to do that.

**Speaker C:** It's working.

**Speaker F:** That's right, you call her Puja. That's an easy one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, easy mode.

**Speaker A:** Divorce time.

**Speaker B:** Easy mode. Why am I so divorced?

**Speaker A:** You're a dick.

**Speaker F:** Why am I such a dick?

**Speaker D:** Nice.

**Speaker B:** Very good, guys. That's time for me. Thanks for the jokes. This was delightful. Great to see you all again. I will be back this time next week. Rick, let's try and talk tomorrow. Yeah, let's do it.

**Speaker F:** I'm up for that.

**Speaker B:** Great, great.

**Speaker C:** Cheers, guys.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you, Dan.

**Speaker D:** Love you, bro.

**Speaker B:** Bye guys, love you all.

**Speaker H:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dan (Speaker B) with a group of Sangha friends, revolves around a core insight from Buddhist practice: **suffering (dukkha) is not caused by external circumstances, but by our internal reactions and attachments.** The conversation is practical, personal, and often playful, reflecting the influence of their teacher, Dhammarato.

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Insight: The Problem Isn't "Out There"**
*   **Carl's (Speaker C) Experience:** He shares that after finishing a freelance contract, he experienced the same anxiety and dissatisfaction without work as he did *with* work. This leads to the pivotal realization: "Because it's not about circumstances." Suffering follows you because its source is internal.
*   **Dan's Anecdote:** He reinforces this with a story about complaining with a friend—one single, one in a relationship—both dissatisfied. The conclusion: "It's about Dukkha. It's about being dissatisfied."

### **The Practice: How to Relate to Experience**
1.  **Notice and Stop:** The fundamental practice is to **see the arising of dukkha (complaint, anxiety, craving) and simply "stop"** feeding that mental pattern. As Carl says, the instruction eventually shrinks to one word: "Stop."
2.  **Playfulness and Attitude:** Multiple speakers (**Tim/Speaker A, Scott/Speaker D, Rick/Speaker F**) emphasize shifting from a serious, striving mindset to one of **playfulness, curiosity, and surrender**. Examples include:
    *   Seeing meditation as a game.
    *   Doing chores (dishes, shoveling snow) with a smile or by focusing on "the most perfect way" to do them.
    *   The group contrasts this with overly serious, "enlightenment-by-storm" approaches.
3.  **Finding Nibbana in the Ordinary:** The group discusses how peace (**nibbana**) is found in mundane moments of transition or awareness:
    *   The moment you sit down at a restaurant.
    *   Walking into a grocery store and noticing the shift.
    *   These are "little mini Nibbana" moments that point to the natural, ordinary state of peace when mental fabrication stops.
4.  **Letting Go of Results:** **Alex (Speaker E)** shares a significant shift in his practice: letting go of the desire to be in or sustain **jhana** (deep meditative states). He finds that by not caring about the state itself and just practicing moment-to-moment, the distinction between "in jhana" and "out of jhana" becomes subtle, and satisfaction becomes more continuous.

### **Supporting Themes & Discussions**
*   **The Role of Joy and Ease:** The group credits Dhammarato for emphasizing joy, which counteracts the "Western dryness" and serious tone sometimes found in Buddhist teachings.
*   **De-conditioning Perception:** They discuss how practice strips away the habitual "networking" that makes extraordinary realities (like a well-stocked supermarket) seem normal and boring, allowing wonder to return.
*   **Belief and Experience:** A tangent explores the utility of belief in practice (**Robert/Speaker A, Ryan/Speaker H**). For example, fully believing that loving-kindness meditation (*metta*) can radiate to others made it more powerful for Robert, raising the question: "What is real?" The group leans towards a pragmatic view: what produces positive results in your direct experience is what matters.
*   **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Craving:** They touch on the nuanced idea that desire for practice and good outcomes (the "karma that ends karma") is a skillful, wholesome craving that leads to the end of all craving.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Suffering is Portable:** It sticks to you, not your job, relationship, or life situation.
*   **Freedom is in Your Response:** Liberation comes from changing your relationship to thoughts and circumstances, not from changing the circumstances themselves.
*   **Practice is Moment-to-Moment:** It's about continuously "starting again" with a light, playful, and accepting attitude in everyday life.
*   **Peace is Ordinary:** The goal isn't a mystical, trippy state, but a sustainable, ordinary satisfaction and contentment available in the present moment.

The talk concludes with humor and camaraderie, embodying the very playful and supportive attitude it advocates.
