### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Scott, good to see you again. I've been seeing this stuff on Skype, as I said, and this is basically what Sangha is really all about, is that mutual cooperation. And I wanted to congratulate you for that. And then you told me a story about being in the gym where someone wanted you to leave his space and got angry at you. And there you went along, go along to get along. He invited you to get angry, so you got angry. Or another way of saying it, you didn't even think that you own the place until he came and told you you didn't own it. And now all of a sudden you do own it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why else would you get angry? Because you think that he's taking something away from you. So in fact, one of the ways of looking at it is, is that his anger was basically because he was disappointed or he was fearful of having lost something. And because you were using it, he thought he had lost it, right? To where in fact you weren't really attached to it that much anyway until you found out that he wanted it. In fact, I've seen that in, in, um, uh, uh, let us say daycare and primary school, or not even primary school, but really younger than that, the age of 2 or 3. And a child is looking around and seeing the other children playing with toys, and instead of going and finding a toy to play with. He wants to go take a toy away from one of the other kids. Oh, that kid's having so much fun with that toy, let me go have that fun with that toy too, never mind that kid. All right, so in fact, this guy in the gym is still in diapers. Yeah, yeah, he wants to play with the toy that you're playing with, and he's got a whole gym full of toys to play with.

**Speaker B:** It's really funny when you put it that way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's really young stuff, is being jealous of somebody because they're enjoying themselves, uh, taking something that, uh, that he probably didn't even want it until he saw you using it. And so what we need in our practice is to be able to see that stuff by looking at it. And we have to remember to look at it. And when we look at it, we can see that kind of behavior and we can recognize, oh, I've got a choice here about how I'm going to deal with this grown man in diapers. Maybe the right thing to do is to just let him go do what he wants to do and just walk away. Yeah, let him have it. Yeah, that in fact, uh, in the, in the daycare, I would say that the wise little kid would be the one who lets the bully have the toy and go play with something else. I mean, if I can enjoy one teddy bear, I'm going to enjoy another one. Or if I've got one talking truck and he wants that talking truck, then I can go play with the choo-choo instead. So that's kind of wisdom, to recognize I can be satisfied with whatever I'm doing. But most children are not that way. We get attached to, oh, I like this toy and I want to keep it because I like it. And so you were in diapers also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was an angry little baby, like just throwing a temper tantrum, right? It's like kind of childish.

**Speaker A:** And so when we wake up and laugh about it like that, we say, hey, you know, I don't have to behave that way anymore. I've got a choice. I don't have to do it the way that I've been doing it all these years, the kind of behavior that I learned when I was 3. But now I can learn that. And you see, probably that's been happening all throughout school, where you would get in confrontations with guys because you both wanted the same thing, the same seat, the same book, the same girl, the same teacher. It doesn't matter what it is. We always want whatever somebody else has got. And we learned that behavior in diapers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And here we see Putin doing the same thing. Putin's still in diapers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the big man baby.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So the question is, can we wake up to that diaper-laden behavior that we have? Can we see that we can act adults rather than acting confrontation and owning things and whatnot like that? Because that's the reality. In fact, in daycare, is that neither one of those little boys owned that Tonka truck. Or in your case, the gym, neither one of you owns that gym equipment. The gym guy, the owner of the gym, owns that equipment. It belongs to him. If you— if he wants to use that equipment while he's in the gym, right, he's got to have a membership or whatever. But he can't pick up that dumbbell or that weightlifting set or whatever like that and go put it in the trunk of his car and drive off. It didn't belong to him. Yeah, just like that little Tonka truck does not belong to the 3-year-old, it belongs to the daycare. If we get that kind of attitude about everything and recognize I don't really own anything, and I'm much better off without having to own anything because anything that I own I've got to take care of And anything that I own and have to be taken care of means that when I lose it, I've got to fight to keep it. That there is grief in the things that we lose.

**Speaker B:** That reminds me of, uh, the teaching of, uh, Meister Eckhart, who says, uh, blessed are the poor in spirit, for they shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. Or like, to be poor in spirit is supposed to mean like to not own anything, like not take ownership over anything, like to, to not take anything as personal. And then that's like heaven, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. When you don't own anything, then you don't have to take care of anything, and you don't have to get punished for it breaking because it doesn't belong to you. You're not responsible for that. And so this is a new kind of attitude that we can take, is that we don't own things. I just had a long conversation with a dude that was kind of upset with Ukraine and Putin and all of that kind of stuff, and trying to tell this guy, yeah, Putin is doing what Putin is doing because Putin is terrified of losing something that Putin thinks he owns. And if he were not terrified, he would not use his army to invade Ukraine, is because he's terrified. Now, there's no reason for you and I to be terrified because Putin is terrified. Let the Ukrainian people take care of Putin. They could do it quite nicely, it looks. They don't need our help. They don't need us to go over and fight with them in Ukraine. So why do they need us to go over there in our own minds and fight? That's it. That's the way of looking at it, is that things like that are not our business. But that gym equipment is not your business. If you're occupying the space that he wants you to move, you can get up and move. There's no problem with that. That's the easy way out, as opposed to— yeah, that's what— that's a neat, a really interesting way of thinking about it, because in our society we're not supposed to take the easy way out. The reality is, is that the easy way out— if we keep taking the easy way out every time we go, then we really never do have any problems because we've always got it easy because we're in the habit of being easy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a better way to live, right? Definitely.

**Speaker A:** But in our society is, is that all easy, like Prajna— if you don't take care of your business for me 'When that business is not taken care of, I'll blame you.' And the answer to that is, 'Well, you can blame whoever's in front of you, but I've just taken a hike. You can't blame me, because it didn't belong to me in the first place.' I had a friend here, his name was Greg, and we developed a phrase of not my business. M-R-N-M-B. NMB. Not my business.

**Speaker B:** Not my business. Yeah, that's another good way to put it.

**Speaker A:** Putin is not my business. Democratic Party, not my business. Republican Party, not my business.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or if someone comes up to you because they're miserable and angry, that's not my business.

**Speaker A:** That's not my business. Yeah, that's a new way of looking, because we've been taught in our society that everything is your business.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** You should get involved. We need voters, we need volunteers. Yeah, we need a draft. We got to get everybody over there to Vietnam so that we could all feel bad together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was in, I was in the military for like a year and I just couldn't see myself, like it didn't align with my virtues. Like I went to the, the Air Force Academy, so it was like a school that when you graduate you become an officer.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but before it's in Boulder. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But before you get to the 2-year mark, you have the option of leaving. Like, you're not like in the contract. And then I was just like looking at the different like jobs I could be assigned to, and one of them would just be like sitting in a bunker somewhere deciding whether someone lives or dies behind a screen, like drone striking people. And I just could not imagine doing that. Like, I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Buddha would recommend in all cases to remain aloof and separated from militias, military, organized groups that have weapons, to stay away from not only the weapons but the people who have them. We don't need weapons. We don't need defensive weapons. We don't, we don't need— I mean, yeah, a pocket knife will do because you can clean your fingernails and do all kinds of little things with a pocket knife, but you don't carry a saber.

**Speaker B:** That's like a more, that's like a more Christ-like approach, right? To like turn the other cheek, or like not to um, take up arms and, uh, commit violence.

**Speaker A:** Ah, yes, Crusaders for Christ. They don't do that. Yeah, Jesus says to do— yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that crazy? Why do people kill each other over a message that's about not killing each other? That blows my mind. Ah, yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, uh, the message of Jesus is actually quite clear in the sense of the Golden Rule, Anagami, love, brotherhood, friendship, companionship. The Buddha is actually very big on that too, in the sense of Sangha, of being able to get along with each other. But you could say that the Jesus approach is that you start on the outside to become friends with other people, and then eventually it filters onto the inside so that you become friends with yourself. Guess what? It never works. If you're not a friend with yourself on the inside, that is very hard to be friends with people on the outside. For instance, it was very hard for you to do the friendly thing with this guy and just walk away from him and say, the place is yours, have at it, I'm out of here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, you had to own it. You had to get it. You had to become part of it. Okay, well, that's the problem with Christianity, is they keep wanting you to join this, that, and the other thing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Evangelical, the Evangelical, like, aspect of it, right?

**Speaker A:** They call it a movement, by the way, and I haven't seen it move anywhere in the past 7 years.

**Speaker B:** That's funny.

**Speaker A:** So the other way of doing it, which is the Buddhist approach, is let's start looking at not cleaning up everything within one's mind, but at least cleaning up what's happening right now. Let's just clean this up right now. Let's just do this right now. And pretty soon we get into the habit of cleaning up what's happening right now, and we begin to gain confidence that we can, and so we become on guard, and we get to the point that things are really good right now on the inside. It's only from that friendship or nurturing or unification of the mind that we have on the inside, do we ever have a hope of being able to have Sangha or camaraderie or people actually having the Golden Rule. In other words, I need to find out the Golden Rule for myself, to treat myself the way that I would want to be treated, rather than treating myself the way that I've been told to treat myself by all of the other people who were treating me the way that they were told to treat me. So the Golden Rule can be applied first on the inside, to start nurturing ourselves rather than being critical of ourselves, to start enjoying being alive. I mean, being alive is quite nice.

**Speaker B:** There's nothing like it.

**Speaker A:** Well, death is certainly not, but being— knowing that one is alive, that's also— I mean, you can be dead to the world in a sense of sleep, and then you don't even know that you're alive, or you could be in a coma. But to know that you're alive also has various degrees. And when we are standing and arguing with someone over a piece of gym equipment, that somehow or another we feel, because the gym equipment is threatened, I am threatened. And therefore there is fear here. And the fear then is almost proof positive that we hold life itself as dear, because we have fear. If we had absolutely no fear, then life wouldn't mean nearly as much to us. So now that we actually recognize how dear life is to us, why don't we really actually intentionally start enjoying it? I mean, the father says that his daughter is dear to him, but if he doesn't call her, doesn't check in on her, doesn't pay attention to her doesn't give her gifts and nice things and whatnot like that, then his dearness doesn't really mean anything. So when we talk about dear life, for most of us, life is really not that dear, that that piece of gym equipment is more important than me being alive somehow. Until this angry guy actually does threaten our existence, and then we get straightened out to recognize, oh, wait a minute, it's not the gym equipment that I'm about to lose, it's my own life that I'm about to lose. Well, guess what? You're about to lose that precious life in the next 2 minutes if you don't breathe. If you don't breathe, you're going to die. So maybe it would be a good idea to say, at least if this is my last breath, let me enjoy this one. That I can begin to enjoy this breath because it's keeping me alive. It's my death sentence being postponed, and I'm alive, marvelously alive, and I could breathe to prove it to myself that I am alive.

**Speaker B:** That's the most beautiful experience.

**Speaker A:** To just enjoy the breath. That it's— if you want to say it in magical or religious terms, it's the best gift that you have ever been given, is this breath of life. But it wasn't God that gave you that gift, it was your mom and pop out having a ball. Or tooth. That's what gave you life. So we could thank biology itself.

**Speaker B:** I never thought about it like that.

**Speaker A:** But we can't think, or we can't, uh, feel gratitude towards a magical concept. Oh yeah, which is God. God's just a magical concept. But being alive is real. Taking a breath is real.

**Speaker B:** But even like my— you can't give the credit to your parents because your parents are just, uh, doing what they naturally do, and then I was created on my own.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. Just a series of events. It's just the natural process of things. That's where we all come from. Is we're all just born into existence due to circumstances. But we could be grateful that those circumstances actually existed. The Buddha is actually quite big on giving mom especially credit, that in fact, to become a monk at any age One either has to have his mother's permission or she's dead. One or the other.

**Speaker B:** That's powerful.

**Speaker A:** You have to have your mom's permission. We see in Thailand that's easy peasy. The moms are actually pushing some of their young men in. And there's all kinds of magical stories about that. When the monk— when her son ordains, she's in heaven. Or she gets a ticket to heaven. Well, guess what? In that ordination ceremony, she's the star of the show. She is in heaven. There are more women paying attention to her than they are paying attention to the actual ordination. She's the mom here. And so that's a very powerful also experience. My mom enjoyed that when I was a monk in the United States, because most of the time monks there, they didn't have their moms there to pay respect to. And so they paid respect to my mom instead. That's part of the Buddhist culture, is how respectful we are and giving thanksgiving to the fact that I wouldn't be here if you hadn't been screwing around.

**Speaker B:** Now I have a question about your mom. Did your mom ever listen to your teachings, or did you ever teach to your mom?

**Speaker A:** For about 25 years, Yeah, she was the kind of Christian that darkened the door of every church. She was the one who had the key. She's not the one who was waiting for the door open. She was there to open the door. That's the kind of Christian she was.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Yeah, I try, I try to teach some of this stuff to my mom, um, she's very Christian, so like I just try to find ways to put it that like, um, well, like make sense to her like in the moment. Um, so I try not to like create too much like, um, uh, arguments, although sometimes I am guilty of doing that, of like arguing about, uh, religion and stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, don't, don't argue about religion because she's not there. What you can say is things that Jesus said.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I found.

**Speaker A:** Stay with that. Stay with what Jesus had to say.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, um, that in fact, going back and learning some verses so that you can pull that trick on her— I mean, this is quoting of Jesus, like, you shall know that Jesus has Good quotes. Yeah, well, they've become very, uh, well accepted in our society, which makes them even better.

**Speaker B:** So people just agree to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but then there's the ones that are more, uh, obscure, like, the birds have their nests and the fox have their fields, but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head. Do you know that? That sounds like a koan, almost like something that's actually a quote from Jesus. And he's the Son of Man, you see, because the Jews in the time, the Israelites or whatever word that they would call themselves, they thought of themselves as the children of God. And they talk about Jesus as being the Son of God, the very big dude Son of God, right? But Jesus referred to himself as Son of Man, kind of turning that stuff upside down. And yet the Christians keep putting it up backwards again.

**Speaker B:** I think there's another Jesus quote where it says, um, the kingdom of heaven is spread upon the ends of the earth, but men do not see it. Or is that not a right quote?

**Speaker A:** No. That's not a right quote. What Jesus said, and it's actually in Luke chapter 17, and it's got a whole context to it because he was actually teaching the kids and the Pharisees, you know, the temple owners, because he's on the temple steps and they come up and start giving him a hard time about when is it going to happen and where is it going to be and where is the kingdom of God and all of this. He was saying The kingdom of God is within you. So that's one that you can use with Mom, that listen, if you're interested in anything that Christianity has to teach, recognize that it's within you. The kingdom of heaven is within you.

**Speaker B:** And that's, that's very similar to the Buddhist saying, uh, be a light unto yourself. Or is that similar? Okay.

**Speaker A:** Well, everything is on the inside. Your heaven and your hell is on the inside. It's not out in outer space or deep under the dirt. Oh yeah, your heaven and your hell is between your ears. And when somebody, Christian, comes up and says, oh no, hell's a real place, and the answer to that is, for you right now It is. You're conceptualizing hell right now, and there you are in it.

**Speaker B:** Now, I was going to ask you what you think about the Buddhist, like, 31 planes of existence, like the idea that there's like higher realms of like— That's not actually Buddhist. Okay, because I was hearing some teachings about that.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's not Buddhist. That's some people who brought that stuff with them, and it probably pre-existed Buddha, but that the Hindus forgot all about it. But somehow or another, the Buddhists kept it written down, and so they think that it's Buddhist, where in fact, no. Heavens and hells and all planes of existence is just more magical thinking that the Buddha recommends you come out of. Those places don't exist for you right now, so why do you think about them right now? If there is a 31st level of existence, why don't you wait until you get there and then take a look around, investigate it, find out what's there? Until then, you're not there, so why give it a thought? Give a thought to what's happening right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the Dharma, right?

**Speaker A:** That's the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is interesting to me because the way he was like teaching it was that he was saying, oh, there's beings in these higher realms that even if they're like, there's a realm correlated to every Jhana and like their nervous system is just wired for that Jhana and they're perpetually— Yeah, the ordinary mind just goes all over the place inventing crap. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's just mental speculations, all of it.

**Speaker B:** That's true. How would you know that? Yeah, that's like, what?

**Speaker A:** Just speculation, dreaming up things. And the guys who were dreaming that up don't even know that they're dreaming it up. They think because they dropped that up, it must be real because it's their thoughts. Rather than thinking, oh, that's just another thought. Yeah, 31 levels, this, that, and the other thing. So what? That's not my business.

**Speaker B:** That's really funny.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can also see that with the idea of these 31 levels of existence and all that are deeply, deeply tied to the belief in reincarnation. To where the Buddhist teaching is rebirth in this moment. You are reborn in that hell, you're reborn in that 31st degree, right here and now. That is not reincarnation. That in fact, whatever it is that's reincarnated, that don't exist. So another way of looking at reincarnation is also not about planes of existence, But let us think about it in the sense of deep, dark past and deep, dark futures, because those 31 planes of heavens and whatnot is way off in the deep, dark future, right? So what we're practicing is to be here now, not be here 10 minutes ago, not be here now 2 hours ago, not be here now 5 years ago, to not be here now 20 years ago, or even 1,000 years ago. So past lives mean nothing, whether that past life was while you were shaving this morning or not, or you were shaving 10,000 years ago with a stone axe. Those things don't matter right now. What matters right now is how does the face feel right now. How does the face feel right now? Never mind what face it was 10,000 years ago, that's irrelevant. Just like those planes of existence, they're all irrelevant, and that they are nothing more than concepts in the mind. For instance, you probably remember something that happened when you were, say, 10 years old. Maybe a bicycle accident, or maybe you got called down in school, or some kind of Dukkha happens when you're 10 years old and we remember it. But when we're remembering it now, that's just a concept, because you don't know whether it actually really happened or not. There's no evidence for it. That bicycle is gone, that teacher is gone, that school is gone. There's nothing left of it. There's no way to verify That episode that happened when I was 10 years old is just a concept now in my mind, and it has no more existence than what happened in a past life 300 or 3,000 years ago. Those are still just concepts. So that's your answer about that 31 planes of existence. They're just concepts.

**Speaker B:** It's like something the mind dreamt up, like the dreaming mind. And like, waking up means waking up into like reality.

**Speaker A:** This is it.

**Speaker B:** This is reality. This is it. It's like it's true beyond a shadow of a doubt. Like, you can't— you don't have to like imagine it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, we take it in with the senses.

**Speaker B:** Well, but also the, the something that at first, at first I thought like in Buddhism, like the idea of the Jhanas, like I thought they were made up too, but then I realized that it's actually something you could experience for yourself. So that's a little bit, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly correct. That for most people, Jhanas are magical thinking. And including when they're in the Jhana, that's still magical thinking. But there is certain things that is an actual first Jhana, and it actually has either, depending upon the way you describe it, either 5 or 6 constituent components. That 6th component we'll talk about in a moment. But the first component is that the mind is free from Dukkha. The mind is free in this moment from the hindrances. The mind is free from unwholesome thoughts. That is either a true fact or not a fact. You have control over how you're going to feel, in other words, our thought, and the kind of thinking that we have in this moment can either be very small in the sense of real because reality is quite small to where the lies are huge. An example of that is I ask you how old you are. If you're going to tell me the truth, you've just got one answer. But if I ask you how old you are over and over and over again and you keep lying to me over and over again, there's no end to how many different ages you can be. Right? So lies are just completely overwhelming the truth. So that means that we need to be careful about what kind of thoughts we have, because most likely it's going to be a lie, is we're just dreaming stuff up. But the first Jhana has that quality of you're having a wholesome, real thought right now, and you know that it's real. So freedom from hindrances is the first one, and the kind of language that we use again is going to be applied and sustained thought. We're going to apply it to the wholesome and sustain it on the wholesome. It keeps sustaining wholesome thoughts, gladdening the mind. And as we sustain on the wholesome thoughts and gladdening the mind, we become— we start to feel as good as we're thinking. So we think ourselves into feeling. We have actually been thinking and talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives. Now it's time to start talking and thanking ourselves into feeling really good. And so by talking ourselves into feeling good, we begin to feel good. And now we're developing more of the Jhana factors. And when we get really good at this over and over again and in practicing it so that we feel good and we feel good and we feel good, then begin to develop the attitude, I can do this. And now we're adding another ingredient to it, and that is now no longer do we have just success— excuse me, satisfaction. But now we're adding to it the feeling of success. I've got this. Similar to the feeling that the quarterback has just when he's making a touchdown. What's the first thing that the quarterback does when he is, you know, in the All-Star victory dance? Yeah, the victory dance. So we need to find a victory dance in our mind. That's that victory dance, is the first Jhana. That feeling of victory dance, mentally.

**Speaker B:** I know the feeling. I used to play sports. When you score that goal, you— Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we need you now that you know and remember what that feeling is like. Keep bringing it up. Keep feeling that way. Become a champion that way. To feel like the lion. Yeah, I got this. Yeah, I can do that.

**Speaker B:** Also, what do you say about if someone says to you— I've had this conversation before— that they think they somehow managed to get into first Jhana, but then they're somehow convinced that first Jhana is awakening, or first is like they like deluded themselves into thinking that there is no Nibbana.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can question them. Ask them a bunch of questions like, what is first Jhana? What are the constituent components of first Jhana? How do you feel when you're in first Jhana? What are you thinking about when you're in first Jhana? And why aren't you in first Jhana right now? If first Jhana was an awakening, why didn't you stay awake? Why did you go back to sleep now that you're having this conversation at me, you're getting actually pissed off because I'm asking you all the right questions, right? So you just proved to me that you're not in first Jhana, and which meant that when you were in first Jhana, it was meaningless. It didn't mean a thing.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yes.

**Speaker A:** What, what matters is right now, not what happened last week or the first Jhana's first turn. You don't care about it. That's in the past. You've lost it. Sorry, it's gone. Is in the past. Is it your Jhana? Your first Jhana is dead meat. Is your— but you could do that in a humorous way so that they get the point. Yeah, I'm not in first Jhana right now, so it must have not been that big a deal. Let me get back into first Jhana now, and then it will be a big deal.

**Speaker B:** Now, that's, that's a good litmus test for awakening, is asking where is it right now? Where's your awakening right now? If you're talking about something you experienced in the past, that's not it.

**Speaker A:** That's not it. Isn't that so liberating? That's— yeah. Oh wow. All we've got is right now. The past doesn't exist. But we also, in our culture, are very landmark or milestone oriented. Rather than recognizing that the mind can be all over the place, we think that the mind is in a progression, almost. In fact, the big mistake that Westerners make with Buddhism is by calling the Eightfold Noble Whatever a path, because it's not a path. It's not going anyplace. It's stopping from going anyplace. In fact, why don't we call it the Eightfold Noble Roadblock? Just stop already.

**Speaker B:** Stop it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, just stop already. You're not going anywhere. I like that.

**Speaker B:** They pulled up a roadblock, really throws a wrench in things. Like, I love that quote that you said. It has been such a profound quote that your teacher told to you, that you said. You said, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And he said, if at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing. That's a revolutionary quote. Like, that's like— because we've been taught, we've been taught to just keep doing the same things that have the same outcome over and over instead of looking, oh, oh, we're doing that wrong, and changing it.

**Speaker A:** That's the essence of Buddhism. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa gave me that, and it just was— just rolled off his tongue with a chuckle, not knowing how many people would benefit from that one remark he made.

**Speaker B:** It's a good one. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing. Exactly. Which means, uh, if at first you didn't succeed with this guy who wanted your gym equipment, look at what you're doing. Oh, he wants it, let him have it. And that would have been even easier.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think that's a good note to end it. It's been a great talk.

**Speaker A:** Great, Scott. Thank you. This has been really great.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much. Yeah, I loved it. Enjoyed it so much. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** All right, Scott, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you next time.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for calling. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friend Scott (Speaker B), centers on using everyday conflicts as opportunities for insight and spiritual growth. The summary is structured around core themes:

**1. The "Diaper" Mind: Ownership and Childish Conflict**
The talk begins by analyzing a gym incident where Scott got angry when a man demanded equipment he was using. Dhammarato reframes this as childish, "diaper"-level behavior: we only want something because someone else has it, and we falsely believe we own it. This pattern, learned in early childhood, continues into adult life and even global conflicts (e.g., Putin's actions). The wisdom is to see this dynamic and choose not to engage—to simply walk away and let the other have it, recognizing that nothing is truly "ours."

**2. "Not My Business": The Path to Peace**
A major practical teaching is adopting the attitude of **"Not My Business" (NMB)**. This means mentally letting go of things we cannot control and that do not truly belong to us—from gym equipment to geopolitics. By not taking ownership, we avoid the burden of protection, loss, and conflict. This is likened to being "poor in spirit" (not owning anything) as a path to peace ("heaven").

**3. Inner Friendship Before Outer Brotherhood**
The discussion contrasts approaches. The Christian ideal often starts with loving others outwardly, but Dhammarato argues this fails if you aren't first a friend to yourself. The Buddhist path starts **internally**: cleaning up your mind in the present moment, applying the Golden Rule to yourself (self-nurturing instead of self-criticism), and finding inner peace. Only from this stable inner foundation can genuine, non-conflictual community (Sangha) arise.

**4. Being Alive Now: The Antidote to Conceptual Thinking**
Dhammarato emphasizes appreciating the reality of being alive **right now**—the breath as the ultimate gift—instead of getting lost in conceptual "magical thinking." This includes:
*   Dismissing speculative doctrines like the **31 planes of existence** or **literal reincarnation** as irrelevant mental constructs. What matters is **rebirth in this moment**—whether you are reborn into a "hell" of anger or a "heaven" of peace *now*.
*   Rejecting dwelling on the past (e.g., a childhood memory or a past "Jhana" experience) or an imagined future. **If it's not happening now, it's just a concept, not your direct experience.**

**5. First Jhana as a Present-Moment Litmus Test**
The talk defines the **First Jhana** not as a magical trance, but as a tangible, present-moment experience of:
*   Freedom from hindrances (like anger or desire).
*   Sustained wholesome thought.
*   A gladdened mind and a feeling of **victory** or success (like an athlete's triumph).
*   Crucially, it must be **attainable and verifiable now**. If someone claims a past "awakening" but is agitated in the present conversation, it proves the experience wasn't transformative. **True practice is about the quality of your mind in this very moment.**

**6. The Core Buddhist Method: Look and Adjust**
The key practical method is encapsulated in a saying from Dhammarato's teacher, Buddhadasa: **"If at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing."** This is the essence of the path—**mindfulness as course-correction**. Instead of stubbornly repeating failed patterns (like arguing over a gym machine), you observe the result (suffering), see the error (ownership, childish anger), and change your approach (walk away, practice "NMB").

**In essence,** this talk is a practical guide to using life's irritations to wake up. It teaches:
*   See through childish impulses of ownership and conflict.
*   Adopt the "Not My Business" attitude to shed mental burdens.
*   Cultivate inner friendship through present-moment awareness.
*   Value direct experience over speculative beliefs.
*   Use the "look and adjust" method to break habitual suffering and choose peace, right here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Gym Confrontation" Story (The Initial Anecdote)**
*   **What it is:** Speaker B's story about a man in a gym getting angry and wanting him to leave a piece of equipment.
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** This story is the foundational example used to illustrate the core teaching about attachment, ownership, and childish behavior. It represents any situation where we feel possessive and confrontational over something that isn't truly "ours."

**2. The "Daycare / Child with Toys" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The extended comparison of the gym confrontation to toddlers in a daycare fighting over toys.
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** This is the central metaphor of the talk. It frames adult anger, jealousy, and territorial behavior as essentially the same as a child's immature impulse to want a toy simply because another child has it. It's used to illustrate:
    *   **Non-ownership:** Neither child owns the daycare toy, just as neither gym-goer owns the equipment.
    *   **The wisdom of letting go:** The "wise little kid" who finds another toy represents the peaceful, non-confrontational choice.
    *   **Universal application:** The talk explicitly extends this metaphor to schoolyard conflicts, geopolitical conflicts (**"Putin's still in diapers"**), and all forms of coveting what others have.

**3. The "Not My Business" (NMB) Metaphor/Story**
*   **What it is:** A phrase and attitude developed with a friend named Greg.
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** This represents a mental framework for discernment and non-attachment. Applying "NMB" to situations (like politics, others' anger, or distant conflicts) is a way to psychologically disown burdens and responsibilities that are not one's own, leading to peace.

**4. The "Breath as a Gift" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The act of breathing is reframed as a precious gift that sustains life.
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** It's used to contrast the triviality of things we fight over (like gym equipment) with the ultimate "dearness" of life itself. Enjoying the breath becomes a practice of appreciating being alive in the present moment, rather than being threatened by perceived losses.

**5. The "Victory Dance" / "Quarterback" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The feeling of a sports player scoring a goal or touchdown.
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** This describes the joyful, confident, and successful feeling of the **first jhana** (a state of meditative absorption). It's not about beating others, but about the internal triumph of mastering one's own mind and attaining a wholesome, joyful state.

**6. The "Eightfold Noble Roadblock" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A playful re-framing of the traditional Buddhist "Eightfold Path."
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** This subverts the common idea of spiritual practice as a linear journey *to* somewhere. Instead, it emphasizes the goal as **stopping**—halting the habitual, misguided mental patterns (like attachment and anger) right here and now.

**7. Comparative Religious Stories/Metaphors:**
*   **Jesus's Teachings:** Used as a bridge for understanding (e.g., "kingdom of God is within you" parallels inner work; "turn the other cheek" parallels non-confrontation).
*   **Meister Eckhart's "poor in spirit":** Used to illustrate the ideal of not taking ownership over anything.
*   **Buddhist Ordination Story:** The story about the mother being the star of her son's monk ordination is used to illustrate gratitude to one's parents for the gift of life, grounding spirituality in real-world relationships rather than abstract "magical thinking."

**8. The "Magical Thinking" vs. "Reality" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A running contrast between conceptual speculation and present-moment experience.
*   **Metaphorical meaning:** Concepts like the **"31 planes of existence,"** **"hell as a real place,"** or even **"God"** are categorized as "magical thinking" or "the dreaming mind." These are contrasted with "reality"—what can be directly known and verified through the senses and present-moment experience (like the breath, or the feeling of a jhana). The core instruction is to wake up from the dream of concepts into the reality of "right here, right now."

**In summary,** the talk uses the **Gym Story** as a real-world hook, then extensively employs the **Daycare Metaphor** to reduce complex adult conflict to its childish core. It builds a practical philosophy using the **"NMB"** and **"Roadblock"** metaphors, and contrasts speculative beliefs (**"Magical Thinking"**) with the tangible practice of appreciating the **"Gift of the Breath"** and achieving the internal **"Victory Dance"** of a focused mind.
