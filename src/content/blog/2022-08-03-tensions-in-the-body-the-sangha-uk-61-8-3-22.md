### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right everybody, welcome to the UK Sangha every Wednesday. Check the link in the description for the exact time. Okay, so me and Vedana were just talking about unpleasant sensations and sort of the reason why these unpleasant sensations are difficult or cause Dukkha is because of various causes and conditions. So essentially how we're viewing— hey Robert.

**Speaker B:** Hey guys.

**Speaker A:** How we're viewing and relating to the unpleasant sensations that perpetuates them and causes Dukkha around them. So what I started doing was asking the Buddha without trying to get rid of or solve the unpleasant sensation, just asking him to describe like specific attributes or qualities of said sensations. And we arrived that they are in the abdomen area and they're experienced as the body. So they're not wishy-washy, they're not expanded. When we actually go with our awareness to the abdomen area and we experience the abdomen, we find that these sensations are a little bit more localized and confined to a specific area, whereas the unpleasant sensations when we're not aware viscerally of the body as we breathe, these unpleasant sensations are a little bit more vague. So they're a little bit more just like they suffuse our almost our entire experience, our entire consciousness with their unpleasantness.

**Speaker C:** So it's more like, it's more like, it's more like if you look for Dukkha in that way, in that regard, bound to this, to the sensation, it's like everywhere you look you find it, but you're not aware of that you're doing this. So it seems that you're everywhere you're looking, you find an unpleasant sensation.

**Speaker A:** Right, so cause of Dukkha can be said to be dependent on the condition of how we're viewing our experience of reality. So if we view our experience of reality through the lens of victimhood, really, of I am suffering, I'm suffering Dukkha, then everywhere we look, right, we'll find Dukkha. Because really, there's shit on our glasses. So there's Dukkha on our glasses, and everything's going to look like Dukkha. And everything's going to look like shit. So literally having a little wakey-wakey moment is waking up to the fact that that's going on, and then seeing clearly the way things really are. And that doesn't mean now that suddenly there's no unpleasant sensations. Because our experience is a mixture of unpleasant sensations, pleasant sensations, and neutral sensations. But that just means we're actually looking at what the sensations for what they really are like. And there's going to be unpleasant sensations are usually fueled by Samskaras, or residues of ignorance. So in this waking up process, we're going to become more aware of unpleasant sensations. So it might seem like we're going backwards, right? Whereas really we're waking up to the fact of the immediate experience of our reality.

**Speaker C:** And that's not really how I see it anymore. It's more like those waves, those samskaras, you know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** But that's not the end of the story. So that's where noting, or most Vipassana practices, start. Oh, waking up to the fact of the unpleasant sensations. But what we do here is we intentionally play with the thoughts and intentionally practice the breath to directly interfere with unpleasant sensations and change them and mess around with them and toy with them. So when we realize that most of our unpleasant sensations are a reaction to some sort of stimulus in the form of a thought, we can play around with replacing thoughts, unwholesome thoughts, thoughts conducive to feelings of safety and security and relaxation and joy and Sukkha and Piti. Not just the thoughts.

**Speaker C:** Can I stop you there at one moment? So if we de-Mahasify, so to speak, in this regard, is there— do you think that it's just Westerners who experienced mostly this Vipassana style and just before this prone to do this because of cultural issues, or is it because I was introduced to things like the Mahasi style? Yeah, what would you guess?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, most spiritual paradigms is sort of misinformation about how the waking up process works. So that we've been told that, oh, we just need to become aware, aware of these things, and that's it. And awareness is inherently free of those qualities. So you're like, you are the awareness of the sensations, not the sensations. So it doesn't do anything to the actual sensations. It just focuses on, oh, remember to be aware of them, right? But this doesn't really, you know, I mean, you may have moments of grace, right, where they magically go away. But this is not going to start to change the habitual tendency and start to change the very mechanism that produces these unpleasant sensations. So what we're doing is more in line with the actual teachings of the Buddha. To practice Anapanasati and to practice really the Jhana. And, you know, there's some debate about whether Jhana is necessary for awakening, but as I understand the practice of the Buddha and as I understand the teachings of Dhammarato, is that 100% it is. So we have to come into a wholesome state and we have to come into a satisfied state.

**Speaker C:** At least first Jhana.

**Speaker A:** At least first Jhana. And you know, there's been reports that people can experience— again, I'm going to be talking about Nibbana a little bit differently than Dhammarato talks about Nibbana. He talks about it more as cooling off, right? So a Nibbana moment. But there's been reports that people just needed to get into first jhana to experience Nibbana. But more frequently, fourth jhana people experience Nibbana because you can really see things really clearly and you can start to deconstruct the mind. But without getting into all that.

**Speaker B:** Nitty-Gritty.

**Speaker A:** Stuff, without— because The thing about the Jhana is that it's always going to be a mental proliferation unless you're actually experiencing it, even if you have experienced the Jhana before. So anything I say about the Jhana, if I'm not experiencing it right now in this moment, is going to be a concept about the Jhana and not the Jhana themselves, even if I've mastered them or done all of them. So sometimes talking about all this stuff and all the Jhanas is kind of fruitless. But back to the misinformation of becoming aware is enough. No, we have to become aware so that we can change it. And this is kind of nailed home time and time again. But there's things we can do. There's options here. We can— so the primary unpleasant sensations was right smack dab in the center of my chest. That's where all the anxiety, that's where all the fear, and that's where all the Dukkha generally lived. And then I practiced for so long before I come into Dhammarato. Oh, just be aware of it, you know. I'm aware of it. And oh, try to see how it's— try to see how it's in awareness, and awareness has no qualities, or awareness is expansive, awareness is broad, and it's in a bath of awareness, and just be aware of it and let it dissolve, or let it be free, or surrender it to the space. So that's kind of.

**Speaker D:** A—.

**Speaker A:** That'S kind of too passive for it to really work. So what actually makes these unpleasant sensations, what actually liberates these unpleasant sensations and creates the causes and conditions for pleasant sensations, namely Piti and Sukkha, to arise is toying with our thoughts. So we can really actually think thoughts that really calm things down and spark joy. So have you guys ever seen the meme where it's like this Japanese woman who she comes in and she like remodels a house and she says This does not spark joy. This one sparks joy. So Robert's seen it. So there's a meme out.

**Speaker B:** I've seen it.

**Speaker A:** Like, this does not spark joy. And then she's like, this one sparks. So we do the same thing with our thoughts, right? Does this thought spark joy? No, it doesn't. Okay, you throw it out. This thought sparks joy. And so we keep it. It's like we're remodeling the furniture of our house, okay? We look at this drab piece of furniture and we see, oh, this isn't particularly useful furniture or decoration. This piece of furniture decoration is not particularly conducive to joy or the feeling of home that I want it to be. So what am I going to do? I'm simply going to replace it. So I'm going to get rid of it. Hey, Katal, welcome aboard. Hey, I don't know if you're having connection problems. The more people's mics on, the better. So we want to see your guys' faces. But what we're just talking about here as Katal arises and passes away. Is talking about playing around with the thoughts is similar to remodeling our house furniture and decorations. So we want to throw away the things or the thoughts that don't spark joy and replace it with things that spark joy and our happiness.

**Speaker C:** That's totally interesting because I talk to Dhammarato a couple of weeks, could be pretty, could be a month ago, about this from Juladasa, who says something like being on the path. I mean, we are not talking about path and things like this, more skill development, but he's talking about path, so I use this term. Like not remodeling a house but completely changing the entire structure of the house while you are living in the house, while you are using the house, every stone taking it out and replacing it or setting it somewhere else down. And Dhammarato said, no, it's not actually This way it's like just cleaning the.

**Speaker A:** House and that's it, right? So a lot of these Vipassana teachings and stuff will be like, oh, we have to brute force our entire— we have to see the emptiness or we have to see the impermanence of every single sensation we ever experience and we have to just unstruck everything. No, all we have to do is clean the dirt and the shit out of it so we can start to see things a little more clearly for how it already is. So we don't need to superimpose emptiness onto things because they're already empty. All we have to do is get rid of the hindrances that is making your life miserable.

**Speaker C:** So this was the way you use remodeling in this simile, right?

**Speaker A:** So similar to that, you know, if there's dirt in the house, there's a piece of furniture that's rotting, it's full of termites, but you're gonna get rid of it, okay? That's— it's like, it's almost like a common sense approach to happiness. It's kind of not very complicated. It's really like you simply develop the habit of stopping thinking yourself into feeling bad and stopping thinking about stuff that makes you feel terrible. And then now what you're left with is just the momentum and the Samskara of the unpleasant sensations themselves without the fuel from the thoughts. So once you get to those and you've done everything you can to change the thoughts and gladden the mind, and you're just left with the momentum of the unpleasant sensations, now what we can do is we can breathe into them. So we can play, we can toy around with these clusters of sensations. And we can change them by taking a deeper breath. Namely, because the sensations are hiding out in parts of the body. So if we take deeper breaths, those parts of the body expand. My chest is going to expand where the anxiety, where the fear where the unpleasantness resides, and the breath is going to physically and viscerally expand those sensations. So that's a direct realization. So without trying to just sit there passively and see how they're empty, we're physically seeing the emptiness of them. You see, that's— it's quite a big freaking difference. I mean, you could sit there for 20 years just wallowing in it and just be like, oh, it's empty, it's empty. I see it arising, I see it passing away. Not-self, or just like with the concept about it. But here we're actually seeing the emptiness sensations because we're toying with them or expanding them. And another added goodie, or another byproduct of doing this, is literally taking these breaths is going to set the condition for like tingly good feelings to happen. Because getting more oxygen into the brain, getting more oxygen into the bloodstream, That's how the human mechanism, the human body, functions at 100% capacity. So it's like putting the best kind of oil into your car, full synthetic instead of the crappy kind, and replacing the oil regularly. So if you don't replace the oil in your car, it's going to get murky and it's going to get polluted. So the blood— yeah, so the level— yeah, and it's going to cause problems and things are going to start to break down.

**Speaker C:** I practice Tomo now for a few years and I know exactly what you're talking about.

**Speaker A:** Right? So we viscerally can remember the experience of it and it's like And it's not some like wishy-washy, you have to hope is going to work. It's a direct causal relationship between this evokes that feeling. So that's a direct insight into dependent origination, as we see that how we feel about things and how sensations arise is dependently originated by causes and conditions, namely how we're breathing. In this case, along with how we do things and how we think about things. So the practice is multifaceted. But yeah, back to the analogy of changing the oil in the car. So if we're not breathing much air in, we're not breathing much oxygen in, the bloodstream is is only going to have access to a certain amount of oxygen, and it's going to be— the blood is going to be reusing that. Whereas if we're taking deep, it could be short breaths, just deep breaths, you know, or it could be long, more steady breaths. And you can experiment and toy around with this, but this is going to recycle the contents of the blood. I mean, I mean, uh, filter out old, old stuff. That's what the lungs do. They filter out, um, the, the oxygen that's turned into carbon dioxide. So, and so, so the percentage of oxygen in your blood will rise and the percentage of carbon dioxide will decrease. Um, so we're directly filtering out our system.

**Speaker C:** And you're getting rid of amazingly much stuff from the body to the environmental air. That's also, it's the pathway goes both ways.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. How do you.

**Speaker D:** Guys breathe to deal with, let's say, the emotions that are very unpleasant. How do you, like, how do you breathe for that? Do you take long breaths into, like, do you feel like you're visual or you're moving the breath into the field? So I've had lots of different advice given me on to deal with that, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right, and probably all that advice looks just like not very useful. So here's actually what's going to work. First off, I need to ask you some questions, like about the sensations. Like, where are the sensations? Like, in your field?

**Speaker D:** A lot of the time it's like this consistent heaviness in my chest that's generally evoked by not being mindful enough. Kind of, I feel it more and more throughout the day, you know, but when I'm with it and I'm able to stay with it for a while, it's not really there. It's only when I'm not really constantly mindful that it starts to feel like, holy shit, there's something really just there, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the heaviness, like, be more specific. Where exactly in the chest is it? Like, where? Like, it's in the— it's in the, like, it's right— it's in the— it's a heavy.

**Speaker D:** No, yeah, it's, it's, it's above the diaphragm, just above the sternum.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, just above the, uh, solar plexus, right? Like where the— yeah, yeah. So that's— yeah, yeah, exactly. That's where, that's where the lung, the lungs expand if, if you're taking a deeper breath. So, um, if you're, if you're taking deeper breaths and your chest isn't literally expanding, you're not doing it right. Your breath should expand the rib cage and the diaphragm and start to stretch, like physically stretch the skin and the muscles around that area, because that heaviness is a physical contraction. So it's a physical tension in your chest with the muscles of the diaphragm. So you literally take breaths and do it right now. Take breaths in such a way that the muscles and skin in that exact area stretch and start to break apart. And you should feel a physical stretch, like if you're stretching your arm, you should feel an actual stretch there.

**Speaker B:** I'll add here that sometimes the stretch can feel like the the chest cavity is sort of like, it's almost like cracking open, like it's like this tight, this tight sheet that's, that's like it's cracking apart in a way.

**Speaker A:** It's cracking apart because it's so not used to stretching out like that, so it feels like it's cracking apart. And you're like, because normally you think like, oh, this isn't the right way to breathe, it's my chest feels like it's cracking apart, or like 'Oh, I need to breathe through the belly.' No, it's bullshit. You need to breathe through the chest and expand it. That's when the lungs are fully expanded, is when the chest stretches apart. And, uh, you may like to, um.

**Speaker B:** Scott, I'd like to interrupt to add something, uh, which is that breathe deep down into your belly and fill up that whole diaphragm until the air expands upwards into the chest naturally. So you're not just breathing into the chest, you're breathing all the way through. And then as it becomes fully full, it'll start to open up that top part of the chest cavity, and the anxieties will— they will crack away as the muscles sort of just expand and crackle.

**Speaker A:** Crackle. And this is exactly what I'm saying not to do, is don't breathe into the belly. That's, that's a misunderstanding of how to breathe. Just breathe so the chest expands. Who cares about the belly? The chest is expanding, and that's what we're playing around with, the sensations there and the tensions there. You don't need to waste time on the belly, just go directly to expanding the chest.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato told me to breathe deeply into the belly and to fill up the diaphragm first, and then the chest would naturally expand after that.

**Speaker C:** The problem is when you exclude the lower part of the torso, you can trigger a sympathetic neural response. So I agree with what Dhammarato said here through the experience of— I forgot your name. It's only Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Anagami.

**Speaker C:** C-I-D.

**Speaker D:** Sorry, I thought you meant my name.

**Speaker C:** No, no, no, no.

**Speaker A:** Oh, my name.

**Speaker C:** The sir with the beanie.

**Speaker B:** Oh, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Robert, of course, Robert. That if you start with the lower torso up into the into the upper torso and you get, so to speak, the whole torso blown up like a balloon, you trigger not the sympathetic response but the parasympathetic response. So you lower your stress levels and so on and so on and so on. This is also in tummo the case. This is also, if you know the Wim Hof method, It's a more Western approach. If you just stay with the upper part, it depends. I mean, some people are wired differently. This is possible. No problem. But from a medical standpoint, it's pretty well documented. So I mean, you can look it up.

**Speaker B:** Yes, another thing Dhammarato told me was that most people, when we breathe, we only breathe into about 40 to 60% of our lungs' full capacity. But when we breathe into 80%, what will happen is the diaphragm will fill up first and then the chest will open up. And if we were to take it to 100%, which he doesn't recommend as it's not the safest way to do it and it takes a lot of effort, then even we'll start to feel the breath in sensations of the breath in our arms and stuff. We might get tingly and lightheaded. That's if we're breathing too deep. But at 80%, we'll really start to feel that chest opening up.

**Speaker A:** Here's why I'm emphasizing the chest so much, is because many are not used to taking deep breaths. So the lungs, literally, it's strenuous to take a full deep breath, that you'll be breathing through the belly, and you won't get to the chest. Because the lungs— yeah, the belly and the chest is great. But, but, you know, the lungs aren't used to taking that much air in the beginning. So what we want to do is gradually increase, like if we're working out. So we want to start to— so we add a little weight at a time. So we want to add more oxygen. So we don't want to be breathing in a way that it's like unpleasant and like hard and difficult, but we want to just add more. And then the lungs are going to get more used to that and stronger. So now you can add a little bit more and a little more until you're taking to the full capacity you can. But the belly will arise and fall naturally because the lungs are built in the body, how the lungs are built in the body. And when they fill up, they're going to cause a change in the body, how they cause a change in the body. So I'm emphasizing the chest here because that's where the tension is. So, so literally breathing in such a way that your chest expands.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the tension is just generally in the chest. Also, it's most a lot of weird strong tension right between my eyes too. That, that's the quite— that's the just crazy one. Like, it's so— that's just such an odd thing. It's so intense right here.

**Speaker B:** Do you get it from meditating as well? Like tension?

**Speaker D:** Yes, yes, I get like tension like.

**Speaker B:** Right there as well. Try Anapanasati. And when I have like a lot of effort in my meditation, like I'm really trying to stay strong and keep my mind in the first Jhana, and this feels like there's just so much I'm having to like suppress. Like I do, I get like tension like right there as well.

**Speaker D:** Try it, try it. Unbelievable amount of tension. It's, it's like It's at some times like I'll go for a walk and I'll be like, what is this thing? It's like a pulsating moving energy. Just, it's just like contracting your old brain. It feels like there's a hand squeezing your brain or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like a pressure there. I really relate to that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's another tension, right? So we can do things to relax tensions, whether it's like— Dhammarato said— Kneading.

**Speaker D:** Or something like that, massaging and kneading.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm going to do right now. So like it's a sinus tip. So go like this, play around with the sign. Like I literally, when some of my friends are having a headache or like pressure, I'll literally do that thing where I just start to like really get into the temples and stuff like that and like behind the ears. And like just play around with it, massage it, and then you'll see, oh shit, it's a whole system. And like playing around with the different pressure points will start to affect, like right underneath the eyes too, like the nose bridge, and then underneath the eyes, and then right next to the eyes.

**Speaker C:** Explore your body, man. It's yours to play with.

**Speaker D:** But I like hearing that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the whole step in the Anapanasati is that the first step is to take the breath practice. So you're training, so you train the breath, and then you become more aware of the body as a byproduct of becoming more aware and training the breath. And then the third step is to relax the tensions or tranquilize bodily formations. Like, that's the sequence of steps explicitly laid out by the Buddha himself. So like, doing all these things is for the sake of eventually it's going to relax things to the point where you're going to experience Sukkha rather than Dukkha. And when you experience Sukkha rather than Dukkha, now things are functioning how they should be and how we want them to be for our purposes of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And then you can start to play around with the levels and skills of things. So you can become, yeah, just like you're becoming a connoisseur of your own body and like your own feelings and how to tinker with things. To start feeling good and feeling the way that you want to feel. And to realize that it's a skill that you can simply develop through repetition and practice. It's not a mercy, it's not a grace, it's not a surrender of many.

**Speaker B:** I hate that word, a surrender. I totally haven't resonated with that at all recently. Like the word surrender, for me now it just like conjures up feelings of like almost a form of escapism, like I'm gonna surrender, I'm gonna give up, and it's almost a way of avoiding my issues instead of facing them and confronting them and, you know, overcoming them, you know, with courage and compassion.

**Speaker A:** The thing, the thing is that as long as there's Dukkha, you're going to want the Dukkha to go away. So Dukkha is the problem. Instead of playing a spiritual game where we say Dukkha isn't a problem, okay, and we say that Dukkha, you know, there's nothing to do about Dukkha when you can intentionally Like, the point of Dukkha is to come out of Dukkha. Like, it's like, Dukkha is a sign that there is practice to be done. And the The motivational aspect of this and the hopefully gladdening and hopefully joyous revelation is that there is a path that has been laid out to the end of Dukkha. So there is a way out. Yes, there is Dukkha. But there's simply a way out of Dukkha. And it may take a lot of repetition and may take a lot of practice, but and may take some trial and error. But this is— there is the path laid out. And like, as long as you're experiencing Dukkha, there is only one way out, and the only way out is the Dharma. So you can postpone it as much as you like, but then, you know, at a certain point you come to the realization that what the problem actually is through wisdom, and you come to the realization The solution is not going to be sensual pleasures and chasing them because that's just perpetuating the cycle of Dukkha. And you see that the solution to Dukkha is a completely independent journey. That, um, um, you know, he abides ardent and fully aware, independent, um, secluded from sensual pleasures and grief and covetousness for the world. So this is the language that is, um, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, but it's directly from the Pali Canon. It's directly from the original Sittas. So it's— we all know this feeling of sitting down and being done, fed up with the world, and solving these problems directly. So having given up the mental proliferation for what we normally look for happiness in. We see the illusion of it, and we see there's only, yeah, that there's only one way out, and it comes from waking up to these things and changing them directly. In our visceral experience. And then insights, after we develop some skill and we have some success, insights about, oh, actually these things are dependent on those things, and those things are dependent on these things, in my experience, will develop. So you just become even better at changing and feeling how you want to feel. So like, it's not like you get the insight, now you can feel better. No, we practice changing how we feel, and then we develop insight that, oh, these things can be changed, and that this aspect of my experience is dependent on this aspect of experience. So now I can see directly the causal nature and how and where to go and what what to remove in order to change things or clear the junk that was stopping the river from flowing. Like, we've all seen that scene from Avatar where there's like the chakras and it's like a waterfall that goes into various pools. And with the removal of each blockage, the water can flow to the next eddy. So that's kind of a good way to conceptualize the Jhana, is that with the removal of hindrances, the water can flow to the next pool of first Jhana. And then the removal, the cessation of the thinking and examining thought, they can go to the next Jhana. And then with the removal of the Piti, it goes to the next Jhana, and so on until it's removed everything, every blockage. And then things flow completely freely. And the realization that the visceral realization of emptiness can can occur. And, uh, um, um, it's good— remember that there's no hierarchy here. It's not like Nibbana is better than first Jhana. It's all good. Once you get, uh, once you are free of hindrances, it's all good from there. Like, you're literally having a good time from there. Like, if you remove the hindrances You— everything, it's all— it's like, it's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. But you really can see how good can it really get, right? But what you really want, if you are not in first jhana, what you really want to be doing is practicing and getting into first jhana and getting into a wholesome state, because that's where the fun is, okay? That's where the party is. You're not at the party.

**Speaker C:** Not a pity party.

**Speaker A:** Not a pity party. We're leaving the pity party, going to the Piti party. Yay!

**Speaker C:** And I like that Robert really emphasizes also his change in attitude. I mean, if I understand that correctly, you know, finding more and more the lion in yourself and really putting right effort in and right attitude and so on with the right view. And that's cool to hear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, anyone long enough can see the dramatic change in Robert, and it's truly like, it's amazing, you know. Like Robert's progression has like really come a long way, and it's like his maturity and his nuance, his insight has come a long way. And you can see you can see the direct change in his attitude and how he feels more and more. And like, yeah, Robert used to be the king of Piti parties, and like, that's what we're waking up out of.

**Speaker B:** It's true, it's true. A lot of— that's why I like surrender stuff. Oh, there's nothing to do, there's nowhere to go, I can just continue to be miserable, and I'll surrender to the misery. And there's no shame, you just go around and around.

**Speaker A:** You just go around and around. And I've been in a pity party. You know, that's what really what depression is, is feeling sorry for ourselves and continuing to feel bad for ourselves and just like circle jerking that into our experience. Like, oh, it's so bad. And oh, it's like I'm a victim and woe is me. And then it's just going to keep the bad feelings going. And then we're going to— we're like We're like, we're like, we're honestly, honestly become addicted to that. And like, like, it's a weird, um, it's a weird craving. Yeah, so we see that, yeah, that's actually what we want to do. Let's change things. And, uh, wow, we can really, we can feel like a kid again. We can feel like that joy and that feeling of being alive, that thrill and that excitement and that reinvigoration and spark of fully being alive. Because a lot of people think that Buddhist meditation and the practice of the Buddha is like life-denying and like very like ascetic. That's not the teaching of the Buddha. The Jhana actually makes you feel vibrantly alive, fully awake, fully here, fully present to the moment. And like, um, one of the biggest experiences I've ever had, of the most powerful, uh, second Jhana experience I've ever had, was when I was actually snowboarding. Because I was like, I was conquering, I was waking up out of hindrances of fear and doubt by literally going up jumps and landing them. And then I was like, yes, I can do this kind of feeling. That's, that's where you go from first to second, is once you develop that success, like that victory lap, that victory dance.

**Speaker C:** And let me, let me, uh, shortly, uh, interlude something because I have to Oh yeah, yeah. What was it? Let me think of it. I'm not that good with jokes. What is a Buddhist who's totally absorbed in his computer?

**Speaker A:** What?

**Speaker C:** Nirvana. So that doesn't happen to me. I have to go now.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Thank you, Vedana. Bye, Vedana. Bye. See you next time.

**Speaker C:** See you next time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right. Yeah. So, yeah. Does anyone have anything they want to say about that? Any questions?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I noticed the other day that I wasn't very mindful throughout the— when I was working, you know, when especially when I'm working and there's so much happening.

**Speaker A:** Your camera on so we can see you?

**Speaker D:** Oh, can you not see me?

**Speaker A:** No, it's there.

**Speaker B:** I can't see you, but I think.

**Speaker A:** It'S— it might just be the connection.

**Speaker D:** You see me now?

**Speaker A:** That's all right. Oh yeah, I think it's just the connection. So go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Is it really choppy?

**Speaker A:** The video is, but we can hear you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to have the video on. You could just go ahead with your question.

**Speaker D:** Okay, okay. Yeah, I noticed, God, I noticed the other day that I was working and I wasn't so mindful, I'd say. I was observing how all these emotions were happening, but I wasn't actually doing anything. Because on top of the work, so much effort, and I noticed my mind wanted to get so lost in the pity. Like, I was like, oh, I'm so, you know, I'm feeling so bad, I can't handle this. And like, all those thoughts were coming up, and I just saw those thoughts, but I can't, like, I just continue kind of just being more equanimous with it, but also introducing, because generally I didn't understand the gladdening of the mind. But I introduced the gladdening of the mind as being this relentless equanimity with it all and just being with the suffering and looking at the suffering and finding more suffering. Because that was the method I was kind of using, the noting and just like, yeah, the bland awareness. But the actual gladdening is so much effort when you're in this deep pitiful state. But when you do it and you do it and you do and you actually get out of it and you're like, holy shit, I can actually make myself feel the way I want.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker D:** It's like such a powerful feeling. There's like such a deep confidence in yourself. You're so grounded, like, right within your body. Like, you're the outside— like, whatever appearances is happening in the outside is like whatever's happening in the outside. But it— you don't— you're not— it's such a beautiful feeling. It's such a confident feeling. And you could just— you could just drag that so far down the road, man. You could just like build it up.

**Speaker B:** And build it up.

**Speaker D:** And I'm so— I'm so excited to see where this goes, you know. I'm so excited to see like how far this goes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's the exact right approach.

**Speaker B:** There's so much you can do with it as well once you have like that inner confidence and that deep like feeling of like, I can do this. It's like it opens you up to so many like new ways to add in like different things in meditation.

**Speaker A:** Robert, I think you broke up, or is that my connection?

**Speaker D:** Connection is the worst here for sure. Robert, I can't hear or see you anymore.

**Speaker A:** Did Robert freeze for you too?

**Speaker D:** He's gone for me too.

**Speaker A:** That's too bad. He was really good. He was really on to something there.

**Speaker D:** Oh, he's back.

**Speaker A:** Robert.

**Speaker B:** I got frozen mid-sentence.

**Speaker A:** What were you saying? Yeah, did you forget?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I didn't catch that. It keeps freezing. It's my internet. I was just gonna say, once you have that comp— once you have that.

**Speaker A:** Oh no.

**Speaker B:** It'S like other practices, um, and, and just like, it's like, it's like you've got the main dish sorted, you can add in the spices, you can put the cherries on top in whatever order you like and create Jhanas with different flavors to them. And it becomes like this, it's like, it's not just like you're trying to do one thing now, you can like have freedom to do so many different things. Just with that confidence.

**Speaker A:** So once you get that spark lit, how big can you make the fire? So like, once you're really feeling that I can do this, like, it's like you feel like you're king of the world, like you're on top of the world, like you're literally like— it's almost funny because you're like winning the game in a sense.

**Speaker B:** So you're like winning the game of life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're winning the game of life because this is the only game. Like everyone, like Anyone else who's doing stuff and still miserable, like, they're not winning. Okay, so this is like winning like Charlie Sheen. Okay, so it's like you're winning. Hashtag winning. And it's like, it's like, it's like so empowering. So it's like you become like the emperor of the entire universe and like you can experience because these, these higher, more advanced states you won't have access to if you see yourself as like a beginner meditator, you see yourself as like not the Buddha, or like not— you're like, if you don't see yourself as it, like I'm gonna be the one to do this and I'm doing it, you're not going to be able to experience like boundless consciousness all these steps of becoming one with everything, that's just a rung on the ladder. Okay, this is where the other traditions, the Hindu traditions, stop. They stop at becoming one with everything. But becoming one with everything is a good experience to have because you really wake up to your experience and integrate it. But there's just one— there's more, there's more to go. Because you're still fabricating a self. So like all of this rungs on the ladder is a rung. So it's like every feeling of I can do this and stuff, it's like a necessary step. And it's like it's actually a really fun step and like enjoy it while it's there, but realize that there's something beyond it too. So enjoy it, enjoy the success while it's there, but realize that there's a state further beyond this even. Because in the MN 111 Sutta that details all the jhanas, it says that at the end of each paragraph until Nibbana. So at the first jhana, Sariputta realizes there's something further beyond this. And then until all the way, it says that each jhana, even the boundless consciousness, even neither perception nor non-perception these really refined advanced states all the way till Nibbana. And then at Nibbana, then this is— there's nothing further beyond this. This is it. So it's kind of like, um, you're in the dark. Um, Dhammarato said this to me one time. It's kind of like if you're in the dark tunnel, like, and you start to see the light, you see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's like going into the first Jhana. But you're not going to sit there and just look at the light from afar, you're going to start walking towards it. And then you keep walking towards the light, and then things evolve and develop. And you experience the processes of the Jhana, and you experience the nuances of the mind and the dependent origination of things, until the point where you go into the light completely. Like, go to the light. Like like that's Nibbana. Yeah, go for it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I feel like the walking to the light analogy kind of thing is very, uh, it's like, um, if you're really trapped in your human unworthiness, you'll be like, I can't do that, I cannot walk to the light, you know, that's way far away from me, like I'll, I'll settle here, this is good enough. Like you have all of these unworthy, constricting self Yeah, yeah, yeah, basically like that.

**Speaker A:** People think like the Buddha is some sort of God, you know, you bow to the Buddha and he's this God, okay? It's like unattainable, dude. They fucking deify this dude. It's just a regular dude who became awakened, and you can do it too. So like people, like, they create whole religions They create all these rituals of like, oh, how dare you disrespect the Buddha? You can only— an ordained monk can talk about the Buddha, Dharma, and attain anything. You can't attain anything. It's like, how dare you? Like, this is my.

**Speaker D:** Concept. Yeah, you know, my concept is up on a pedestal of who the Buddha is. My Buddha is on a golden statue. Do not even come close to my Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, like my idea of the Buddha, and they're just circle-jerking a mental concept, right? So instead of actually doing it, so they're going to study and be a scholar without actually becoming a Buddha. When I'd rather actually become a Buddha, like I don't really care about the packaging or like the rituals.

**Speaker B:** You unwrap the gift and then you throw the packaging away. You don't keep the fucking box.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So yeah, the ornate box, the realization that none of these rules of society, even Buddhist society, applies to this process and this enlightenment. And what was I going to say? Yeah, so the light at the end of the tunnel analogy and the— oh yeah, the common belief that maybe in another lifetime I become enlightened, or maybe, maybe I'll become a Srotapanna and then I'll get into a heaven realm or something like that.

**Speaker B:** I'll take Bodhisattva vows, but I won't.

**Speaker D:** Do the work to become a Buddha, you know. I'll do, I'll take vows to be a Bodhisattva in the next life, but I'll never actually believe I can be a Buddha, you know. It's so So strange.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's another one.

**Speaker D:** And you see how it's really just, it's just mental, like proliferate, like it's just, it's just like getting around feelings they don't want to feel. Like it's very simple in a way, like it's just like the same old shit basically you've been doing your whole life, but you're now like— it's sort.

**Speaker B:** Of like a cope. I can't escape my suffering, I can't— rather, I can't bring an end to my suffering, so I'll find a meaning in the suffering that will make it worthwhile. But it's a coping mechanism because you're still suffering.

**Speaker A:** All Christians do that. They're like, oh, like, they're like, oh, I must suffer, I'm not worthy, okay, uh, Jesus died for my sins because, oh, he saved me, thank you Jesus, you saved me. Like, like, freak it, it's like, it's a loser, it's, it's honestly such a, you know, it's a, uh, you know, it's B mentality, it's like, it's a losing mentality. And so you're going to make your bed and you're going to sleep in it. So if that's how you view things, you're going to experience, you're going to feel like a loser. If you view yourself, if you view yourself as a loser, you're going to feel like a loser. And I don't like feeling like a loser. I don't know, like, do you guys like feeling like that? I don't like it. I'd rather be a champion. So like, that's why the The lion animal is used as a symbol for this thing too, because it's like being a lion, okay? It's king of the jungle. It's being a champion. It feels like that, and that's how it should, and that's the feeling that we're evoking. And it's coming in.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's like, you know, if you know, like circus, you know, like elephants in the circus or something. Elephant is like king. The elephant is like, whoa, this is such a majestic— unlike an elephant in a circus chained up its whole life, right? And it's basically conditioned in such a way to believe everything around it owns it. And then it's like, okay, and now it's an adult elephant. It's this huge elephant in chains, but the chains are taken off one day, but the elephant still sits around because in its mind it's like it's It believes it doesn't understand that it can just get up and do whatever it wants. Like any moment you literally have choice moment to moment, every moment to do whatever you want. It's just that you don't feel you can do it. But if you just realize, wait, you can do it and just do it anyway. Oh wait, you can do it. And then the real genuine confidence that isn't constructed from fear, the actual inner confidence that's inherent, that's what you really are, that real deep confidence. Just happens, emerges. It like explodes away all the bullshit conditioning because you could just do whatever you want, man, in any moment of your life.

**Speaker A:** It's crazy.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's so funny when you actually see it as reality.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad you brought that up, the elephant analogy. The— okay, so like these baby elephants are tied, um, they have like a some sort of fence or like they're tied by a little rope and so they can't move past a certain point. And then once they grow up into a giant elephant— so once they— that's like when we're children, we're put on all these rules and we're bound by all these psychological prisons. And so we're— we become a loser and a victim in our own minds. And then when we grow up, we don't realize that we're a big adult now and we can change how we feel about things. So like the elephant grows up, it can just rip that rope right off, but it doesn't know it can because it's used to the conditions of when it was a child. So that's like coming into spiritual adulthood, really what it means is to wake up to the fact that we can rip the rope off and be free. And the only thing I would change is the getting rid of a true nature view. So the idea of our true nature view, rather view it as things are dependently originated. So even Nibbana and even awakening and Buddhahood is dependent upon causes and conditions. So everything is inherently dependent due to causes and conditions, and there's no true nature behind it. So there's no ground of being and there's no true nature. It's just if we change with the cessation of this comes the cessation of this. So the only thing we're teaching here is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So with the cessation of these causes and conditions comes the cessation of the effect. So what we're doing is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. With the cessation of this comes the cessation of Dukkha, and that's not a true nature. That's just a byproduct of the different causes and conditions and the insight developed of how it all works and how it all functions. So we're waking up intentionally and developing insight of how it's how things are interrelated and how the mechanisms of them work. And through that, we free ourselves from the illusion of it. But it's no— there's no self to free itself. So there's like no true self to arrive at. It's like, it's the recognition that there isn't— that the experience of the self is sort of like an impermanent changing phenomena that is a byproduct of circumstances.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker A:** Toying around and playing with the circumstances and following the path of the Dhamma, just leads you to knowledge and visions of things as they are. So rather true nature of self, which is a good stepping stone, I feel like, to the true Dharma. But from my new Theravada perspective, I try to avoid. So I came from like self-realization, like Advaita school. And I found that the view of true self is— it's actually, it may seem good, but it's— I don't think it's as advanced and nuanced of a view as it could be. So seeing things more as dependently originated, and things are caused by causes and conditions. So Dukkha, sense of self, all that is a more scientific approach than my true nature is Buddha, or my true nature is liberated or free. Because then that kind of creates a subtle clinging. It creates a subtle clinging to a ground and to a self that is liberated. And it creates the mental echo and mental image of that, which that is to be seen as not the ultimate. So the experience of Nibbana is a subtractive process. It's literally subtracting everything away. So it's not arriving at a true self per se, but it's just subtracting any idea of self or independence. Like, there's no, like, there's no soul, or there's no There's no person, even true self person, so even glorified person, even infinite person, to link experiences together. Really, all there is is just experiences and phenomena happening. And realizing that a specific phenomena, namely Dukkha, is the only problem. So learning how to play with the phenomena to eliminate Dukkha is the only thing that we need to worry about. And then from then, like, it doesn't matter if it's a true self or not. But like, not to like be like overly critical about the true self way of looking at things, But I'm just saying from my own experience, getting rid of that concept has been extremely beneficial for me in terms of the end of Dukkha. So I don't have any concept of being a true self aside from the fact that on the way up to Nibbana, the conviction and the realization that I can do this and I can be my own Buddha and I can be the Buddha. So that's kind of different, like that I can do this, that like I am doing it and I can do it is a little bit different to, oh, I'm realizing my true nature. It's like a direct product of changing our experience. So it's like, but it's only an intermediary step. Even that is a fabrication. Like even the sense of self that is doing it is a fabrication. But it's like a necessary, it's a necessary fabrication. And it's a very enjoyable one. It's like a tool, it's a toy that we're playing with. So all of these things are toys. And all of these things can be examined. Even the true self can be examined, looked at, deconstructed. There's nothing that is like that. That's the teaching of Anicca. There's nothing that can't be examined and deconstructed and looked and seen clearly.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think I trust very much in just practicing and seeing insight for myself, you know, in these things. And then whatever concepts I have to get me to the insight will probably just dissolve, I would imagine. That's how it's been working out so far. Or my misunderstandings or the confusion just you see things in such a way that they just die very quickly, you know, like you see, ah, this is not correct, this is not right, and it just kind of pops out, you know.

**Speaker A:** Exactly that. No, perfect. Yeah, that's kind of like the true self teaching is a necessary— it's almost a necessary step. It's like almost, um, it is needed in the sense that um, it is that, uh, I can do this. It's actually true self is the transition from first jhana to the second jhana. That's a, oh, true self. And then from then on, it becomes more no-self and more no-self. So true self is like, I am free, like, I am liberated, I am, I am that, I am that. That feels good, right? It feels good to be that. Like it feels good, um, Nisargadatta Maharaj, or it feels good to Papaji, like you are the consciousness that pervades all experience. That feels good, like I am the one doing it and I can be free and I am free. That's the transition from, uh, first Jhana to second Jhana. And then from then on, uh, that those, uh, those, uh Like that starts to, even that starts to, the idea that I am, that starts to fall away. And then you start to experience that without the I am.

**Speaker D:** Yes, that's exactly it. Because I think that I really feel, I know that from, that it's just, it's kind of just an experience that doesn't seem to have I to it, to say I am this, I am this. It's not, you can't point to it, or you can't say it's something separate. I think it's an experience which you are, and once you are, there's no real things to say left, or there's no I to say, to claim it as personal, to self or something, to name it as something personal.

**Speaker A:** So to realize that the experience I am is a function of experience rather than an intrinsic quality of reality. So it's not a ground of reality. Like, I am— like, that's what Hindu will teach you, is that I am is the ground, whereas no, that's just an aspect of reality that arises and passes away. It's impermanent, you know. So even clinging on to that, well, what does that do? It will cause Dukkha. Clinging on to I am will cause Dukkha. And, uh, you know, a lot of, a lot of spiritual traditions don't want to hear that, but, um, I go around to these non-dual circles and I look around and I see, are these people awoken? No, they're not. They're like, they're just attaching and they're circle jerking onto the concept I am, I am, I am, I am. Well, whatever, you know, I'd rather just like deconstruct things completely and just you know, arrive at the true Dharma of the Buddha. It's more excellent. Okay, I'm better spiritual, you know, I've never lost a spiritual pissing contest on the internet. I'm the undefeated. Yeah, I see you wrote that. Yeah, yeah, this is a running joke we have in the Sangha. But yeah, unless anyone has anything else they want to bring up, I think that's a good note to end it on. It was beautiful talking to everyone, and I think it was a really good Sangha call, really fun. I really enjoyed hearing what Robert had to say and what you had to say, Tal.

**Speaker D:** And yeah, I really enjoyed talking with you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, till next time, everyone.

**Speaker B:** It's been banging, banging conversation. Cheers, boys.

**Speaker A:** Banging Dhamma fresh out the oven. Yeah, Dharma's a match. Later.

**Speaker B:** In a bit.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A** (likely a senior student or facilitator in the Dhammarato lineage), centers on a practical, active approach to ending suffering (*dukkha*), contrasting it with more passive meditation methods. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: The Nature of Suffering**
*   **Dukkha is perpetuated by our relationship to unpleasant sensations**, not the sensations themselves. When we view experience through a lens of victimhood ("I am suffering"), that feeling suffuses our entire awareness.
*   Unpleasant sensations often feel vague and all-encompassing when we are unaware. By bringing mindful awareness to the body (e.g., the abdomen or chest), we can see they are more localized and tangible.

### **Critique of Passive "Awareness-Only" Practices**
*   The group critiques common Vipassana or "noting" practices that emphasize **passive awareness** of sensations (observing them as "empty" or impermanent) without actively trying to change them.
*   They argue that while awareness is a necessary first step, it's insufficient. Merely observing suffering doesn't dismantle the habitual mechanisms (*samskaras*) that produce it. This approach can lead to stagnation, where one "wallows" in suffering for years.

### **The Active Solution: The Dhammarato Method**
The proposed path is active, playful, and based on the Buddha's instructions on *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) and *jhāna* (meditative absorption).

1.  **Gladden the Mind Through Thought Work:**
    *   The first intervention is at the level of thought. Unpleasant sensations are often fueled by unwholesome thoughts.
    *   Practitioners should actively **replace thoughts that "do not spark joy"** (anxiety, self-pity) with thoughts conducive to safety, security, relaxation, and joy (*sukha*, *pīti*). This is likened to remodeling a house by replacing old furniture.

2.  **Work Directly with Sensations Through the Breath:**
    *   Once thought fuel is reduced, work directly with the residual bodily sensations (e.g., heaviness in the chest, tension between the eyes).
    *   The primary tool is **conscious breathing** designed to physically expand and "play with" areas of tension. For chest anxiety, this means breathing deeply to make the rib cage expand and stretch the constricted muscles, causing the sensation to "crack" and dissolve.
    *   **Important Debate:** A discussion arises on technique:
        *   **Speaker A** emphasizes breathing to expand the **chest** directly where tension is.
        *   **Others (Robert, Vedana)** reference Dhammarato's advice to breathe deep into the **belly/diaphragm first**, allowing the chest to expand naturally, which triggers a parasympathetic (calming) nervous response.
    *   This breath work has a direct physiological benefit (increasing oxygen) and leads to **direct insight into dependent origination**—seeing the causal link between how we breathe and how we feel.

3.  **The Goal: Jhāna and Confidence**
    *   The aim is to cultivate wholesome, joyful states—**at least the First Jhāna**—which is seen as essential for awakening in this lineage. Jhāna is described as feeling vibrantly alive and confident, not life-denying.
    *   Success in this practice builds an **inner confidence**—the "lion" mentality—that you are capable of changing your experience and are not a victim. This confidence is a necessary fuel for deeper progress.
    *   The path is framed as a ladder of *jhānas*, each transcending the last, all the way to *Nibbana* (the end of suffering). The "true self" or "oneness" experiences of other traditions are seen as high but interim steps on this ladder, not the final goal.

### **Key Themes and Conclusions**
*   **From Pity Party to Pīti Party:** A shift from a passive, suffering-identified mindset ("pity party") to an active, joyful, and empowered one ("pīti party" or joy party).
*   **Demystifying Awakening:** The talk rejects the deification of the Buddha. Enlightenment is presented as an attainable, natural result of a cause-and-effect process, not a grace bestowed only on monks or in a future life.
*   **Dependent Origination Over "True Nature":** The ultimate framework is **dependent origination**, not realizing a "true self." Even advanced states and the sense of "I am" are seen as impermanent phenomena to be understood and let go of. The final goal (*Nibbana*) is a subtractive process, not an arrival at a supreme self.

In essence, this talk advocates for a **hands-on, empowered, and joyful practice** where the meditator actively uses thought and breath as tools to reshape their immediate experience, building confidence and insight on the path to the end of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to explain meditation concepts, the nature of suffering (Dukkha), and the path to awakening. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Dirty Glasses / Lens:** Unpleasant sensations and suffering are perpetuated by how we view reality. If we see through the "lens of victimhood," it's like having **"shit on our glasses"** or **"Dukkha on our glasses."** Everything we look at appears tainted by suffering until we "clean the glasses" by waking up to this habit.

2.  **Remodeling a House / Sparking Joy:** The practice of replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones is compared to **remodeling a house** or **tidying up (referencing Marie Kondo)**. You look at your thoughts like furniture: if a thought **"does not spark joy"** (causes anxiety, fear), you throw it out. You replace it with thoughts that "spark joy" and create feelings of safety and happiness, thereby "remodeling" your mental environment.

3.  **Changing the Oil in a Car:** Deep, conscious breathing is compared to **putting high-quality, fresh oil in a car engine**. Shallow breathing is like using old, polluted oil—it causes the system (body/mind) to break down and perform poorly. Deep breathing "filters the system," brings in fresh oxygen, and allows the body to function at 100% capacity, producing pleasant feelings (Piti, Sukkha).

4.  **The Chakra Waterfall (from *Avatar*):** The progression through the Jhanas (meditative absorptions) is likened to **unblocking a series of pools in a waterfall**. Each hindrance or blockage removed allows the energy (water) to flow freely into the next "pool" or higher state of concentration, until it flows completely freely at the end.

5.  **Light at the End of the Tunnel:** The journey toward awakening (Nibbana) is described as **walking toward a light at the end of a dark tunnel**. The first Jhana is like first seeing the light. The path isn't about staring at it from afar but **actively walking toward it** through practice, with Nibbana being the point where you fully emerge into the light.

6.  **The Chained Elephant:** Our conditioned sense of limitation is compared to a **grown elephant still held by a small rope it could easily break**. As a baby, it was conditioned to believe it couldn't break free. Similarly, we are psychologically conditioned from childhood to believe we are limited or victims, not realizing we are now "spiritually adult" and can break free from those mental chains.

7.  **Winning the Game / Being a Champion:** The confidence and success from gladdening the mind and overcoming hindrances is described as **"winning the game of life,"** **"being a champion,"** or **"being the king of the jungle"** (like a lion). This contrasts with the "loser mentality" or "B mentality" of seeing oneself as a perpetual victim or unworthy.

8.  **Unwrapping a Gift:** The practical Dharma is the precious gift; religious rituals, ornate packaging, and dogmatic rules are just **the box and wrapping paper**. The point is to use the teachings (the gift) and not get attached to or idolize the external trappings (the packaging).

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

*   **Personal Anecdote (Snowboarding):** Speaker A shares a personal story of experiencing a powerful **second Jhana while snowboarding**. The act of conquering fear and landing jumps created a visceral feeling of victory and capability, which directly translated into the meditative shift from first to second Jhana.
*   **The Story of Sariputta (referenced):** The progression through the Jhanas is contextualized by referencing the **MN 111 Sutta**, where the disciple Sariputta, upon reaching each state, realizes **"there is something further beyond this,"** until he reaches Nibbana, where there is nothing beyond.
*   **Critique of Other Traditions:** The talk includes a narrative critique of other approaches:
    *   **Passive Awareness ("Surrender"):** This is criticized as a form of **"escapism"** or **"brute force"** that doesn't actively change the underlying mechanisms of suffering. It's compared to just staring at dirty furniture hoping it will clean itself.
    *   **"True Self" Teachings (e.g., Advaita, Non-duality):** While acknowledged as a useful stepping stone (like the confidence of the second Jhana), it is ultimately seen as a **"subtle clinging"** to a concept. The talk advocates moving beyond to a view of dependent origination, where even the sense of "I am" is seen as an impermanent phenomenon, not an ultimate ground.
    *   **Deification of the Buddha / Ritualism:** Turning the Buddha into an unattainable god or focusing on rituals is dismissed as **"circle-jerking a mental concept"** instead of doing the actual work to become awakened oneself.

### **Summary of Key Themes via Metaphor**
*   **The Problem (Dukkha):** Seeing through dirty glasses; being a chained elephant; having rotten furniture in your house; driving a car with old oil.
*   **The Method (Practice):** Cleaning the glasses; remodeling your mental house; changing your mental oil; walking toward the light; breaking the rope; replacing joyless thoughts with joyful ones.
*   **The Goal & Progress (Jhana/Awakening):** Winning the game; being a lion/champion; water flowing freely through unblocked pools; fully emerging into the light.
*   **Wrong Turns (Critiques):** Staring at the light from afar (passivity); admiring the gift wrapping instead of using the gift (ritualism); believing you are just a baby elephant (victimhood); clinging to the "I am" furniture (true self concepts).

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of awakening as an **active, empowering, and embodied process** of cleaning, repairing, and confidently taking charge of one's own mind and experience.
