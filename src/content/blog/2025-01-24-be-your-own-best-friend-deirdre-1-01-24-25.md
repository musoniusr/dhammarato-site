### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, got it. I have to let you know that it's recording. Skype tells me.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think it's got a little green dot at the top right-hand part of the screen saying that, and it also is beeping now, so it looks like it is recording.

**Speaker A:** It's recording, yeah. Great. So.

**Speaker B:** All right, so. You had a friend die, and then you had another friend die, as opposed to dying again.

**Speaker A:** Yes, not dying again. That will be the day.

**Speaker B:** Well, when we say again, that means that you're taking it personally.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, taking it personally. They died on you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, don't do that. Don't die on me.

**Speaker B:** Well, first off, there's another way of looking at it, and that is that you are the survivor.

**Speaker A:** Correct.

**Speaker B:** You outlived them. Reminds me of the old man. The first thing in the morning that he does is he opens the old-timey newspaper and looks at the obituaries, and he looks for two things. One, he looks for his own name, and he doesn't find it there. And then he looks at the obituaries to see who he knows, to see who's died. And then the outcome of that— of, haha, you're in the obituaries and I'm not. Yeah, okay. There's also that with the old monks that, uh, 1993 Bhikkhu Buddhadasa died, but in I think 2018 September, Goenka died, Vela Maramsi died, Shula Dasa died. And every time the thought is, haha, I outlived you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I get that, Dhammarato, but what about the friendship? I mean, those people are dear to me. I have nice times with them.

**Speaker B:** When are you going to be dear to yourself?

**Speaker A:** Sorry?

**Speaker B:** When are you going to be dear to yourself?

**Speaker A:** Well, I think I am.

**Speaker B:** All right, then if you're dear enough to yourself, then you can afford to lose them and your dearness to them. Yeah, and you'll still have enough dearness.

**Speaker A:** Left, like a reservoir, reservoir of dearness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a great big reservoir of I'm okay. Because you can't stop them from dying, but you can stop yourself from feeling bad about them dying. You can see the good side of it. At least you're still alive. Take a deep breath and say, yeah, baby, I'm still here.

**Speaker A:** I'm still here. Yeah, so like for now, appreciate more life because I'm still here. Yeah, appreciate it more.

**Speaker B:** Which is just the opposite of what happens with almost all people when they lose someone. It brings on the fear of their own death.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that makes me like anxiety because then I feel I'm in a hurry to get it accomplished.

**Speaker B:** And guess what? You don't have to be in a hurry anymore. You're an old lady now. Give it a break. There is nothing to be accomplished. Let's put it this way: you're not going to be famous and in the history books 300 years from now. You're just not going to do it. And guess what? The ones who do make it into the history book are because so many people hate them for them doing such a bad job. For instance, Trump in the books, Putin will be in the books.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Biden, I'm not sure he'll be in the books 300 years from now because he didn't screw up really bad.

**Speaker A:** So it's better not to be in the book.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's best not to be in the book.

**Speaker A:** Not my goal. I wanted to be famous, but I'm not anymore. I don't want that anymore. I'm just letting it go. Yes. It's more like.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let it go. So that means that you've already accomplished enough. Can you be satisfied with what you've already done?

**Speaker A:** That's the hard one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the whole point, is satisfied at the end of life. Are you going to die bitterly and in anxiety and wanting more and more and more? Or can you be satisfied? This is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, connection. Say that again.

**Speaker B:** I said, why die full of anxiety and wanting things when in fact right now you've already accomplished a lot? You've made it into old age. It's good enough. There's nothing left to do.

**Speaker A:** Why doesn't that resonate somehow? I think I've been so indoctrinated that who I am is what I do.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so when you see that, recognize it. That's the whole point of recognizing that stuff is unwholesome. And just throw that out and say, hey, I'm good enough, I've accomplished enough, I've done enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the strange thing is what happens if I— of course, when I meditate and find the breath and then say, okay, there's nothing to do, nowhere in the world, I don't have to do anything. That sticks for a while, and then there's something like, but then I'm doing nothing. And I'm, you know, that's, and what now?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the whole point, is what a now this is. Instead of what now, that's looking into the future. Yeah, as if you haven't done enough. What now means I've got to do more. You don't need to have to have a what now. You can just enjoy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, still have to practice more.

**Speaker B:** Finally, you could have said, I could have had an enjoyable life when I was 30.

**Speaker A:** All right, like looking back and saying that instead of looking into the future and saying, "I've screwed up enough already.

**Speaker B:** It'S time to take a break.".

**Speaker A:** 'Look at everything I've done. I've done so much.' Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. That's a nice counter-thought. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Or you can think of it as, 'Don't worry, be happy. It's about time you'd be happy. Look at all the worry and look at the anxiety you've had all of these years, and what has that gotten you?' Not much. So now is the time to change.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the thing is, it's also brought me a lot. It's not that it didn't bring me anything, only anxiety. But the thing is, everything I create, there's so much responsibility.

**Speaker B:** Like, that's right. Everything you build, you got for fear of loss. But if you've lost everything, you've lost your fears, you've lost your anxiety, there's nothing left to lose. Isn't that freedom? Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. And so when you lose it all, then you can really be free.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And then what about friendship? I mean, I think it's good to invest in friendship, but there's also a responsibility.

**Speaker B:** But a friendship is different than attaching to people to get them to make you feel good because you can't make yourself feel good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. And that's why I mind so much when I lose them.

**Speaker B:** It's because you relied upon them to make you feel good. Instead, you can feel good with or without them. And not only that, but at a higher level, it's your job to be not only friends with yourself, and so friendly that now you can go out and make new friends and be the shoulder that they cry on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I am once in a while. But isn't it like that also feels like a responsibility?

**Speaker B:** But that's the whole point, is that you're not responsible. How many— I mean, how long are you going to have wet shoulders? How wet can your shoulders get?

**Speaker A:** Well, very wet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they can get wet or they can stay dry. It's up to you. But what I'm talking about is, is that if you can have good friendship with yourself, you can be good friends with other people who don't have as much Dharma practice as you do.

**Speaker A:** Correct. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because the world is full of unhappy people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So be the happy one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so be the happy one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, true.

**Speaker B:** The whole world not only is unhappy, but the number one thing they want in life is to be happy.

**Speaker A:** And to have peace of mind.

**Speaker B:** Well, happiness comes part of peace of mind. No fear, no worries, everything is safe and secure and comfortable and we're satisfied. Wow, isn't it great?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but we have to remember that because we're in the habit of, oh, poor me, my friends died. Oh, poor me, I need this and that. Oh, I've got so much anxiety, I've got to get so much done. Well, if you get all that stuff done, what are you going to have? More anxiety? To get even more done? When is enough enough? Can we at least have come to the point that now is enough?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. But still, it's like, I don't need to save my friends. That's not my responsibility.

**Speaker B:** They're not your responsibility. That's right. That each one of us has the responsibility to save ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S quite a human tragedy that Christianity came by and says, oh, you need a Jesus to save you. And so now everybody's out looking for a savior. We need to be taught that I can do it for myself. If you can do it for yourself, and you know you can do it for yourself, then that also comes with the knowledge that everyone has to do that for themselves. You cannot save anybody.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All you can do is be friends while you watch them suffer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, be friendly. But sometimes what happens is that people try, okay, in the basics I'm quite a happy person, so people like to hang out with me, that's fine. Sometimes it feels like they just, you know, they do the trick around, they want me to be in their company all the time because then they feel good.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh, okay, isn't that marvelous that you can cheer people up?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it sometimes feels like also like an obligation. I have to do that.

**Speaker B:** No, you don't.

**Speaker A:** But what do I tell them? I say, no, I don't want to see you?

**Speaker B:** Well, you can say, this is not a good time. Why don't you go feel good by yourself? You can start with those easy clichés like, don't worry, be happy, you don't need me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I could tell them, go watch a video of Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to be— I don't want to be— I don't want to make them less or be rude or whatever. No, it's not that. It's not pointing out to the videos that it's rude, but it feels like they could feel rejected.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's a difference between saying no and saying later.

**Speaker A:** True, true. Yeah, and then there's sometimes like, it doesn't, it doesn't feel— it only feels like it matters when I'm with them. They cheer up, but the moment I'm gone, they start texting me again. Can we meet again? Because now I feel bad, I'm depressed, I have so much problems.

**Speaker B:** And that, and you can start to— you've got someone like that who's relying upon you, basically that's the same thing as now you're a teacher and they're a student. If that's the situation, if you've got someone that's in that position, now you can become more honest with them.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you can say, hey, you don't need me to be happy. You go practice how to be happy on your own.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's not like being rude. But it's more like giving them tools to do it themselves.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. It's not being rude. You've been told that it's being rude, but it's not.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's something like I always have to help others or something, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know. My mother was an Anagami. She was deeply ingrained in helping. She was a nursery worker at church, and then she was the accountant for the church, and then she ran an old folks home. She really was. The thing is, is that helpers have to help because they feel bad and they're not helping.

**Speaker A:** There is no free will.

**Speaker B:** There's no free will to it. They're driven to help.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so that— and you've got a little of that. Probably not as much as my mom. My mom was world-class helper.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not like that. I don't run an elderly home or whatever. No, I don't.

**Speaker B:** But you can be free from that even though you've got just a little bit of helper. When that helper comes up, oh, I've got to help somebody— no, you don't. That's the first point, is that when you've got helpers, that means that the people who want your help will rely upon you, and when you're gone, they're stuck. So the better thing to do is to teach them how to help themselves.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we can start with that easy one. Don't worry, be happy. You don't need me to help you, you're already okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and what sometimes happens is that then they start taking drugs or whatever because they feel bad, and then it's hard for me not to feel bad myself because I think, oh, if I helped them, they wouldn't do that.

**Speaker B:** Right, except that it doesn't matter how much you help them, they're still going to feel bad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the only way is to teach them how to help themselves.

**Speaker B:** That's the only way, and you're not even responsible to do that. I mean, you cannot save the world.

**Speaker A:** No, no, I know that.

**Speaker B:** See, one person at a time, just one person at a time, you can tell them, fuck up, be happy, don't worry, you don't need me. What you need is to remember that you're already okay.

**Speaker A:** And you don't need all those stuff like drugs and alcohol. You don't need it. You're already okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's one of them, right? That's, that's one of the major failures of our society is that we don't teach our children that they're already okay. We want to— in fact, the worst of it is, is to tell the child that they're special.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Because even if they grow up saying that I'm special, what that means is, is that I'm so special that I can get other people to help me. And yet they still— the ones who were special, the ones who feel bad because deep inside they don't believe they're special.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I made that mistake with my son, the oldest one. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Don'T teach our children that they're special. Teach them that they're okay. All by themselves.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's better.

**Speaker B:** And you're okay even if you don't help other people who are not okay. You're still okay.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. I will remember that. Yeah, I don't need to accomplish anything. I don't need to achieve anything. I don't need to do anything with other people. Just be happy. Just be happy. And then people want to hang out with you, that's okay too. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome.

**Speaker B:** Good one. All right, you remember that. If you forget, don't worry, call me. I'll make you happy again.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato. But I'm not going to be dependent on you.

**Speaker B:** No, you can't. I won't let you.

**Speaker A:** Oh, good. Nice. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. Well, we'll see you later, Dietrich. Thank you for the call. I've really enjoyed seeing you again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for having this conversation. It's been really helpful.

**Speaker B:** Good one. All right.

**Speaker A:** See you on Sunday in the Sangha. Sunday in the Sangha. See you Sunday.

**Speaker B:** I'll see you Sunday.

**Speaker A:** That's it. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** All right.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching from Dhammarato (Speaker B) to the practitioner (Speaker A) revolves around **finding self-sufficiency, contentment, and happiness within oneself, rather than seeking it from external accomplishments or relationships.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. Reframing Loss and Mortality:** The talk begins with the practitioner grieving the death of friends. Dhammarato reframes this not as a personal loss ("they died *on you*"), but as a reminder of one's own survival. The advice is to appreciate being alive and to see the "good side"—you are still here.

**2. The Trap of "Accomplishment":** The practitioner expresses anxiety about needing to achieve or "get things done" before dying. Dhammarato challenges this deeply ingrained belief ("who I am is what I do"). He advises letting go of the need for fame or grand accomplishments and learning to be **satisfied with "good enough."** The goal is to die in peace, not in anxious striving.

**3. Cultivating Inner Dearness and Happiness:** A central theme is shifting the source of well-being from outside to inside.
*   **"When are you going to be dear to yourself?"** If you are a "dear friend" to yourself, you create an internal reservoir of well-being. This makes you less dependent on others for happiness and less devastated by their loss.
*   The ultimate aim is to **"be the happy one"** in a world of unhappy people. Happiness is described as freedom from fear, worry, and the need for more.

**4. Healthy vs. Dependent Friendships:** The practitioner worries about the responsibility of friendship. Dhammarato distinguishes between:
*   **Unhealthy Attachment:** Relying on friends to "make you feel good" because you can't generate happiness yourself. This leads to suffering when they are gone and feels like an obligation.
*   **Healthy Friendship:** First being a true friend to yourself. From that place of inner stability, you can be a supportive friend to others **without feeling responsible for their happiness.** Your role is not to save them, but to point them toward their own capacity for self-help.

**5. The Limit of Helping:** The practitioner's slight "helper" tendency is addressed. Dhammarato notes that compulsive helping often comes from the helper's own need. True help is **teaching others how to help themselves.** You cannot save anyone; everyone must save themselves. The best thing you can give someone is the message: **"You're already okay. Don't worry, be happy. You don't need me."**

**6. Practical Outcomes:** The talk concludes with the practitioner internalizing the lessons:
*   "I don't need to accomplish anything."
*   "I don't need to achieve anything."
*   "Just be happy."
*   From that place of inner happiness, interactions with others become optional and joyful, not obligatory.

**Core Message:** The path to peace lies in releasing the burdens of external validation, achievement, and the need to manage others' emotions. By cultivating inner contentment and self-friendship, one finds a stable happiness that is not shaken by loss or external circumstances. The motto **"Don't worry, be happy"** is presented not as a cliché, but as a profound practice of recognizing one's inherent okay-ness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to convey his points about dealing with loss, self-worth, and responsibility. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Reservoir of Dearness:** This is the central metaphor. Speaker B suggests building a "great big reservoir" of love and care for oneself. The idea is that if you have enough self-love ("dearness to yourself"), you can afford to lose friends without being emotionally depleted. Your own reservoir remains full.
    *   *Used to illustrate:* Self-reliance as emotional security.

2.  **Wet Shoulders:** Represents the burden of taking on other people's emotional problems. Speaker B asks, "How long are you going to have wet shoulders? How wet can your shoulders get?" It visualizes the weight and saturation of others' grief.
    *   *Used to illustrate:* The unsustainable responsibility of being the sole emotional support for others.

3.  **Freedom = Nothing Left to Lose:** Speaker B directly quotes the lyric ("Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose") to reframe loss. The metaphor suggests that when you let go of attachments (including the fear of losing people or things), you achieve true freedom from anxiety.
    *   *Used to illustrate:* The paradoxical gain found in letting go.

4.  **The History Book:** Being in the "history book" is a metaphor for worldly fame and legacy. Speaker B argues it's "best not to be in the book," as those who are remembered are often infamous (like Trump or Putin). True peace comes from letting go of the need for such accomplishment.
    *   *Used to illustrate:* The futility and potential negativity of seeking external validation and legacy.

### **Stories/Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Old Man and the Obituaries:** Speaker B tells a story about an old man who reads the obituaries first thing in the morning. He first checks that his own name isn't there, then looks to see who he knows who has died. The unspoken conclusion is a sense of survival: "haha, you're in the obituaries and I'm not."
    *   *Used to illustrate:* A darkly humorous perspective on outliving others, emphasizing the survivor's point of view and the simple fact of being alive.

2.  **The Old Monks (Buddhadasa, Goenka, etc.):** He references specific monks who have died, noting the same thought arises: "haha, I outlived you." This story extends the obituary anecdote into a more spiritual context, showing this perspective isn't mean-spirited but a natural observation of impermanence and survival.
    *   *Used to illustrate:* The same "outliving" principle applies even to revered teachers; it's a universal, impersonal fact of life.

3.  **The Helper's Trap (Speaker B's Mother):** He shares that his mother was a "world-class helper" (nursery worker, church accountant, ran an old folks' home). He explains that such helpers are often *driven* to help because they feel bad if they don't, creating a cycle of dependency without free will.
    *   *Used to illustrate:* The compulsion to help others can be an unhealthy attachment that prevents both parties from developing self-reliance. It's used to caution Speaker A about her own "helper" tendencies.

### **Recurring Themes Framed by These Devices:**
*   **Shifting Perspective:** From loss ("they died on me") to survival ("I outlived them").
*   **Self as Foundation:** The "reservoir" must be internal, not dependent on others.
*   **"Enoughness":** The goal is to see your life as "good enough" now, with "nothing left to accomplish."
*   **Teaching vs. Saving:** True friendship/help means teaching others to be their own source of happiness ("go feel good by yourself") rather than becoming their emotional crutch.

These metaphors and stories work together to challenge conventional reactions to grief and responsibility, promoting a philosophy of self-sufficient contentment and mindful detachment.
