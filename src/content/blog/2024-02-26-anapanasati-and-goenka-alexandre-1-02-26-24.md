### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Basically, there's nothing for you to do, okay, except to listen. All right, now in the Anapanasati Sutta, step 4— or not a step, but item number 4— and the point of breathing in long and breathing out long— in fact, the sutta talks about breathing in long and breathing out long, and yet Goenka doesn't talk about it. In fact, in some cases he even goes so far as to say, don't control the breath, just watch it. And that's absolutely backwards from the way the sutta talks about it. The sutta talks about it in the sense of taking long, deep breath on an in-breath and long, deep breath on the out-breath. Why is that? Because we're learning to control the mind. And the mind is controlling the breath. And if you just ordinary breathing and not watching very closely and not, let us say, having any stake in the game, not having any dog in the fight, then the mind will wander away very easily. But if you're actually paying attention to what the breath is doing because you're actually manipulating the breath, then you can stay focused easier. All right, step 3 is what Goenka spends the most time on, and in the Sutra it talks about investigating the body, to know the body, to have knowledge of the body. And yet he's doing it in a systematic way, rather than the way that it's taught in the Satipatthana. Of watch what the body is doing. So if you're body scanning down to the elbows and your knee hurts, he says to go back to the elbows instead of paying attention to the important stuff. He wants you to go in a particular sequence.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And what we need to do instead is pay attention to what's going on. This is why in the Satipatthana Sutta it talks about grasping, reaching, touching, moving the body. Where are your hands? What kind of facial gestures you have? And you become aware of what the body is doing. If the knee is vibrating, notice the knee is vibrating, jumping up and down, wiggling. Notice that. And the body scanning doesn't teach what we actually need to do. They're more interested in the technique. But even step 3 is not the point. The point is to relax the body. And so step 3 is actually to find what tensions, what problems, what darknesses and all of that are in the body, so that we can come to the point of relaxing the body. That's the whole point of the Anapanasati Sutta, as far as the kayanupassana or the body is concerned. And so now that I've explained it to you this way, you can say that, wait a minute, Goenka has missed the point.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I also feel it when I'm practicing the technique because I'm like, okay, I'm scanning, I'm observing sensation, I'm trying to be equanimous, but at some point I feel like I'm just practicing another Anapanasati, but with instead of the breath, another object, which is the sensations. But then I'm like, but if Vipassana should be the step further, Samatha, so Anapanasati. Why am I feeling doing the same than Samatha, you know, somehow?

**Speaker A:** Well, if you're not relaxed, and in fact by the time that the students are given the teaching of strong determination and they're not ready for it, they wind up being strongly determined to be in pain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Strongly determined to hold still when in fact the body is not ready for that. So the strong determination settings that Goenka have actually goes in the wrong direction, because the whole point is to relax the body, to become comfortable, to become easy. Because the whole teaching of the Buddha is to come out of Dukkha, come out of your dissatisfaction. And there the students are sitting in great dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is funny. It is downright humorous when you recognize that much of the teaching of Goenka is downright wrong. Not just wrong, but harmfully wrong.

**Speaker B:** Because when you think about the Middle Way of the Buddha that says you shouldn't be in the extreme of being in pain or being in total, let's say, ecstasy or blissful. It should be in the middle. And then in the Goenka, you're like, you should be equanimous with your pain because it rises and at some point it will pass away. Okay, right. And then you have Sankhara rising, deep-rooted Sankhara rising. And I'm like, yeah, sure, but I know this pain is because I've been sitting for many, many hours and this is not Samskara. This is just like physical pain, which is maybe linked to some— Well, it.

**Speaker A:** Is Samskara and here how it is. People who are raised in the tropics in Thailand and in India, they sit on the ground, they sit on the floor, they sit on a mat. In Europe, they sit in chairs, they sit on furniture, and the little babies are grabbed off the floor and put in chairs, even high chairs, to sit at the table with the adults. To where in Thailand, they put the food on the floor and sit down on the floor with it. So your whole life you have spent developing leg muscles in a way that was not designed to sit on the floor. So in fact, it is Samskara. It's the old habits of how the legs are done, and you're not now used to sitting on the floor. Yeah. And there's no reason for you to be uncomfortable. Here's a point: in some of the meditation retreats that you'll find in Thailand and in other places they don't sit so long, 30 minutes at the most. And even then, the students are advised that if there is any leg pain, to stand up, to walk around, to walk at all. Do not sit in pain. And yet, Goenka expects you to sit in pain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's actually how I learned to practice through Zen, because they do 30 minutes of Zen sitting, and then they would do 30 minutes of walking meditation, and they would go back on sitting and walking, sitting, which for me, I guess it's quite healthy. But yeah, in this Goenka frame, it's just all about being equanimous with your pain. It's okay, it will go away. But at some point, if you If you don't have any knowledge previously of practice, all right, it's, it's, it's really dangerous, I feel, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. I know of a number of people who can't sit at all because the leg pain is too tough. I even know monks who cannot sit with other monks because they have never learned to sit correctly. Yeah, by doing a gradual kind of thing. That in fact it has the same analogy to going to a gym. And the beginner who goes to the gym, the first thing that a good trainer will do is to give him lightweight dumbbells and have reps over and over and over again, short. But what a lot of the students want instead is to go to the dumbbells the barbells and try to lift 100 kilos, 100 pounds, more and more, straining themselves, hurting themselves. Why? Because the guys that they admire can do that, without recognizing that the guys that they admire for doing that had to start with the simple training.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** All right, so in a way, Gowanka was taught wrongly because he's trying to give students really, really, you could call it advanced work to do right from the very beginning. And there's no reason for that kind of work at all. No one needs, except that they're going to call themselves a bodybuilder, have some competition and that kind of stuff. But you can go to the gym and get healthy just by doing the repetitions over and over again. But this is what the real teaching of the Buddha is about. Another point is, is that Goenka does not spend much time with the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. Whatever he's talking about, and he talks about equanimous a lot, and that's not even a good word. It's not even a word that's used in English. Okay, that what a better word to use is actually balance, which is another word for the middle path. And equanimity, uh, the way that he teaches it and the way the students understand it is way off there someplace. Oh, you're supposed to have great pain and still be equanimous. Oh no, the right thing to do is to see what pain is and find out a way to avoid it and then be happy. That you could get out of it. Yeah, to nourish the body when the body is sore and hurting, take care of it. And he's talking about it in a completely different method. And the completely different method actually then doesn't bring about the middle path. If you teach extremes, people are going to live in extremes. And if you've noticed the students who are gathered around and do the, uh, let us say, the volunteer work and all of that, you don't find them happy. You didn't. In fact, I did not find Goenka a happy old man. He was ferocious.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So he didn't even get out of the, uh, the Dharma what the Buddha was trying to to point out, that the Eightfold Noble Path is basically to see the unwholesomeness and make a change. The word Sati means to remember, to wake up, to take a look, and that looking then is a discriminatory looking to see what needs to be changed, and then we change it. So if the thoughts are unwholesome, "Oh, my leg hurts," go Anicca wants you to just sit there with those unwholesome thoughts, "Oh, my leg hurts," hoping that equanimity will come by someday. And that "Oh, my leg hurts" means let me put the leg in a comfortable position, because if the body is comfortable, then the mind can become comfortable, and then the feelings become comfortable. But if the body is in pain, the mind is in pain, and the feelings are in pain, there is not much progress of the Buddha there. You will wind up creating Dukkha rather than eliminating it. Now there is another sutta that is interesting to note. It's got a point to it later on that I'll get to, and that is the sutta is number 22 in the Majjhima Nikaya, and it is named The Simile of the Snake. Okay, now basically what The Simile of the Snake is about is the Buddha teaches that the correct way to catch a snake is to have a long stick that has a little fork in it. And you pin the head of the snake down with that fork so that you immobilize the snake right at the head. Then by pushing the face of the snake, pushing his throat down in the dirt, you can then pick up the snake and hold it in a way so that the mouth is not open. If the mouth of the snake is open and you're holding him by the by the neck, especially a cobra, can turn right around and bite you on the hand. So you have to catch the snake in a way so that he cannot bite. And the only way to do that is by having the mouth of the snake closed. This is the teaching of the Dhamma. If you grasp the Dharma in the wrong way, it's going to create Dukkha, not eliminate it. And you might have heard some places, in the Dhammapada and other places, that the teaching of the Buddha is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. Well, what's good about strong determination sittings?

**Speaker B:** It's painful. Yeah. And if you succeed somehow, it is more like a pride of, oh, I succeeded.

**Speaker A:** Pride, exactly. And so it actually builds ego rather than helping one eliminate the self. It builds pride, it builds tolerance for pain, which means that you bring in pain. The teaching of the Buddha did never talk about it like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the real point of the teaching of the Buddha from the simile of the snake In that same sutta, he says that both formerly and now, I only teach one thing. The whole teaching of the Buddha can be summed up in three words: Dukkha, Anicca, and Nirodha, which means dissatisfaction can cease. Stop the dissatisfaction. Now, a lot of the people who take Goenka retreats and other kinds of meditations, they have the idea that it's a long process, especially when they're not practicing to have it good immediately in the beginning and good immediately in the middle, and then eventually a long-term good. What instead they do is they practice in a method where the snake of the Dharma bites them and they create more Dukkha. And so people get the idea that the correct way of practice is Dukkha, see the Dukkha, recognize the Dukkha, see how this Dukkha is created, see that it creates from this way to that way, and this is, this Dukkha is associated with that Dukkha, and we go right down the Dukkha rat hole. And it may be years where we're staying in a Dukkha rat hole. All right, that's not the teaching of the Buddha at all. The teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Which means see the Dukkha, get good at seeing Dukkha, so you can come out of it immediately, right away. See your dissatisfaction and stop it right now. And this is the practice of Anapanasati, to see the discomforts in the body and relax those discomforts, to see the unwholesomeness in the mind and make a change so that the mind is more wholesome right now. To see that the feelings of anxiety, tensions, worry, frustration, anger, stress, all of that can be immediately worked with. If the body is comfortable, the mind is comfortable, then the feelings will become comfortable. But if the body is under stress, or the mind is under stress, then the feelings are going to continue to be under stress. And so the Eightfold Noble Path comes this way, is to practice to be able to wake up— that's the Sati— to really wake up and look at what's going on. That's the Dhammarato, the right noble view. It's not a viewpoint or an attitude or a right way of looking, like a worldview or a point of view, is not what we're talking about here. That's ordinary view. The word view here, right, noble view, is actually looking. It's a verb. It's an investigation or an investigating. Here's an example with the word investigation and investigating. Is, is that an investigation is often a bunch of paper in a folder sitting in somebody's drawer in a desk. That was an investigation. But in order to get the investigation, they had to do the investigating. They had to actually see what was there. And this is what we can do. And we do this with the discernment of, is what I'm doing right I'm thinking right now, is that Dukkha or is it not? And if it is Dukkha, change it so that it's not. And so we begin to have thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine. But if we have thoughts of, oh, my knee hurts, that's Dukkha. The thoughts of, oh, the leg is giving me a message, let's pay attention to what the leg is saying. Let's heed the messages. If the pain is in, if the leg is in pain, do something about it. If the tooth is in pain, do something about it. If the hip hurts, do something about it. If the neck hurts, do something about it, like hold the neck still. Like a broken arm, that's why they put the broken arm, they put it in first a cast and then they put it into a sling. And yet most kids who have a broken arm, they still continue to use their hand, and then the arm doesn't heal well. The reason that we put it in a sling and put it into a cast is so the kid can hold the hand still and let the healing process occur. But that's not the strong determination sitting. The strong determination sitting is to hold it still even when that's painful. So the Buddha is all about removing pain, and Goenka and many other meditation systems is all about learning to have pain and tolerate it. Yeah. And the teaching of the Buddha is to stop having pain, to listen to what the body says and do what you need to do to let the body heal. This is again a very good example of the simile of the snake. A lot of people practice Dharma thinking that what I need to do is let these snakes bite me and somehow survive. And the right way to do it is that if you've got to pick up a snake because it's dangerous in your neighborhood, you pick it up correctly so that it doesn't bite you. Hold it so that it cannot bite you, and then deal with it as you would.

**Speaker B:** With a cobra.

**Speaker A:** Right, grab it not just by the throat, but grab it high on the throat. Grab it right behind the head so that you can have your thumb right on its head. You hold it really, really high. I've seen on YouTube, I've seen in Florida, for some reason it was bad to have a snake as a pet. But when the cobra— excuse me, the python started getting big, they let them free. And now they've got a great big python problem in Florida. And so the guys go out trying to catch the snake and they'll grab it, but they'll grab it with its mouth open by the throat of the neck while the snake's mouth is still open. That's very dangerous. They got to watch that head every second because that snake can move his neck around so that he can bite. So this is the whole point about the Dharma, is that you've got to grab it correctly. And the correct way of doing it is so that it's good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It doesn't bite you. But the way that Goenka teaches, it bites. The Dhamma bites. It will bite you if you practice it wrongly. And so basically, this is a big change model, and the change is right there in the Eightfold Noble Path under the label of Right Noble effort. So what is effort? Right noble effort is the least amount of effort to actually get the job done. Now, for beginners, it takes more effort. It takes more effort because they're not used to taking the right effort. Part of the reason it takes more effort is because they're not watching, and so the Dukkha will roll on until they finally catch the Dukkha. Dukkha, and then they have to make a change by unraveling it. But you get very good at it, to wake up, look at it, see that this is Dukkha immediately, and make a change. To change it from the unwholesome thought of, "Oh, my leg hurts," into, "Let me soothe the leg, let me reposition the leg, let me come out of pain." and deal with the leg correctly. Let's stretch the leg, let's stretch the mind, and the kind of thoughts that we're going to have would be thoughts of, wow, this is nice. Wow, the leg doesn't hurt. Wow, everything is okay. No place to go, nothing to do. Everything is easy. Everything is free-flowing. From pain, and that's the real training, is to change our attitude from "this is tough, but I can do it somehow," into "dang, this is easy." So we change it from tough, hard to do, but I'm resilient and maybe I can do it if I train hard enough, into changing that whole mental attitude to make it easy easy in the beginning, easy in the middle, and easy in the end, so that we could feel safe and secure and comfortable. And by feeling safe, secure, and comfortable, we can begin to feel satisfied. Now, safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied actually has a Pali name to it. It's called Sukkha. And that Sukkha in the Pali is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha in the Pali. The same thing is true in the Thai language, suk and duk, and the same thing is true in the Gujarati language, because I've had a student whose parents were Gujarati and they spoke Gujarati, and for sure in Gujarati, dukkhi and sukhi are opposites. So, if you could get your mind right now, the first day you practice, if you could get the mind into a state of Sukkha, get the mind relaxed and feel free and comfortable and satisfied that this is all we need right now, guess what? Right then and there you're free from Dukkha. This is what the teaching is: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Come out of your dissatisfaction into a state of satisfaction. And we do that by changing the way that the mind works, we change it by changing the kind of language that we use, we change it because we're changing the body and the body's posture to make it comfortable, and then all of that together will help change the feeling from the attitude of a victim and the feeling of, "Oh, this is hard," into the feeling of being safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied. And then we take on the feeling of being a winner, being okay, changing our attitude from being a victim into being a champion, to being the boss of your own life, to become an emperor of your own pile of dirt. And it can be done. But we have to practice it over and over and over again. Why? Because the old unwholesome thoughts, the old unwholesome feelings will come back. Can you catch it? Can you see it? Can you change it right then and there? This is the teaching of the Buddha, is specified right there in the suttas. For some reason, people read the suttas, they read right past it. They don't understand that this is an immediate practice. To see those unwholesome thoughts and change them right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's one of the reason I kind of got caught in what you were saying in the videos, because through what I been reading through many books, you know, Mahayana Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, it's all about this process, long process of getting to some certain point and you should expect some, something, yeah, magical, like you were talking about the magic of Buddhism, but there's no such thing. It's just simple breath, watching, and what are you doing with what's going on inside.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Bhikkhu] Enjoying your life, learning to enjoy the life, this particular moment. It's not a long-term process, it's an immediate process, but you have to keep doing it over and over again, The long term is just a series of right here, right nows. And all you've got is right here, right now. What's your choice? You're going to choose to feel the way that you want to feel, or you're going to choose to feel the way that you're in the habit of feeling? Your choice. But you don't have a choice if you're not watching, if you don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's the whole point of looking. If you look at the Dukkha, you could see it as Dukkha and then change it right here, right now. Start having wholesome thoughts. The wholesome thought would be no place to go, nothing to do. Well, I could just relax. Ahh, I could just relax. And so we relax the body by doing long deep breaths like this. Ahh. Just relax. Everything is okay, everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the thing that you're saying, like when you see some unwholesome thoughts, like Dukkha, I see you. And I actually tried this when I would see something, and it was funny because usually what I learned, it's like you shouldn't talk in yourself when you see something. It shouldn't be like, haha, I see you. Just observe and let it go somehow. But since I tried this way of, oh, I see, and then I'm like, oh, okay, I see, and then it goes away. Like, I'm like, okay, let it go, it's fine, you know. And but this is not taught in any way.

**Speaker A:** But that's a change, the letting it go is a change. That's the right noble effort, is, ah, never mind.

**Speaker B:** Ah, let it go. But the thing is, I would already do this without creating a sentence in my head, you know. But I think for most of people it would be like helpful to just be okay by saying in your mind like, oh, I see it, it's fine, let it go. Instead, it's just about you should just observe and somehow let it go, but you cannot say any word in your head, you know.

**Speaker A:** Here's no There's— that's another fallacy. You do not have the skills to stop your mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just like a great big ship, like a big cruise liner or a big cargo ship or a big, uh, naval vessel, a military, an aircraft carrier— none of those have brakes. Not one big, big ship has brakes. What kind of brakes would they have if they had brakes, right? What you need to learn to do to pilot that big ship is to learn how to look in advance to see where it's going and then steer it to avoid— to steer it a little bit over here and a little bit over there. Okay, and this is an important point, that this is what we're doing with right noble effort. We're not trying to stop the mind or make it let go. We're just redirecting it, like, oh, I don't need that right now, I'm okay right now, everything is all right right now. We begin to steer the ship to a wholesome place. So we have words like, "Oh, never mind, I can handle that, everything is okay." Yeah, but we need to also do it with the body because the body is screaming about the pain, and the answer to that is adjust the body, adjust your mind, adjust your feelings, And eventually we'll adjust our attitude from being a victim, to where all life is tough, or, "Oh, I need help," into easy peasy, got it made, got no problems at all, everything is all right, everything is fine. And so we can begin to do it that way. That's the good in the beginning. And we keep doing that over and over again, applying the mind to the wholesome and then sustaining it on the wholesome. Applying, sustaining, applying, sustaining.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the mind's thought patterns will begin to change. The habits will begin to change because we keep doing it over and over again. Just like muscles will build up, well, you're getting muscles built up in the brain. Just by having those wholesome thoughts. I could do this, I could do this, everything's okay, got no worries, got no problems, everything is all right, no problem, no worries. And when somebody is holding the snake the wrong way, they got to watch that snake every second. But if you're holding it correctly, and you know you've got it correctly, the snake can't even squirm. It becomes docile also. So we have to make sure that we're grasping the Dharma safely, and once we do, we can easily watch it. So this is the practice. We do that over and over again, right noble effort. These three things run in circle around each other. They run in circle around each other, the sense that Sati helps us to look, to remember to look helps us to look, to looking helps us to see, and the seeing then will tell us what needs to be done, so the changes, and then practicing the changes over and over again, and practicing Sati and practicing the looking, they begin to work together as a team. They run in circle around each other is the way that it's talked about in the sutras, and the skills develop together. To remember to take a look and to make a change. To remember to take a look and to make a change. To look at the thoughts. What we used to think were wholesome now begin to look unwholesome. So we can begin to change even the wholesome thoughts to make them even more wholesome.

**Speaker B:** I never heard of it, even this wholesomeness, to get it even more wholesome. Well, maybe yes, I did in the Mahayana teaching, but it's not said this the same way. I guess it's not as simple and practical.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's bring this talk to a close and you can learn to go practice a bit. Are you going to call me back?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** At some point.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I would recommend about a week. Go practice about a week, get it going, and then call back again and we can go a little bit deeper, a little bit more sophisticated. Once you begin to get those, we can learn to apply those skills. All right. And one of the most important things is to come out of the wrong practice that you've been practicing with Goenka and start in having correct wholesome practice.

**Speaker B:** Well, the one thing is that the practice that I started with Goenka is like half of my practice, because for me Anapanasati was always my main practice. Vipassana technique that I learned is kind of new for me.

**Speaker A:** Well, guess what? We're doing Vipassana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Looking at what it is and making a change. What's the point of vipassana? What do you think? Does it mean?

**Speaker B:** No, that's the thing that I got confused because for me there was like. Yeah, but at some point I feel in Anapanasati I'm just doing the same than with the Vipassana technique. But the vipassana technique is so like of exaggerated, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Yeah, they expect too much of it. And not only that, but what's the point of having an insight if you don't make a change? So you wind up having same old stupid insights over and over again, and you never get anywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're looking for a great big giant insight, and then maybe things will change. Well, the only thing that's going to change is your behavior about making decisions to make a change. That you could put your hand in the fire and find out that it's a big insight to find out that fire is hot. And then you put your hand right back in the fire again and it's hot again. Two insights.

**Speaker B:** And then you put your hand right.

**Speaker A:** Back in the fire again and now you've got three insights that the fire is hot. What's the point? There's no education in the second kick of a mule, they say. There's no education in the second burning of your hand if you're learning it the first time. So insight is basically the point that it takes to make an actual change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and not all this mystical practice that you can read in Mahayana.

**Speaker A:** Or in Theravada.

**Speaker B:** So, would you advise me just to keep practicing like 15-minute session, multiple times a day?

**Speaker A:** 15 is okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** But I recommended doing it often during the day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** 6 or 8 times a day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you're out traveling, you've got nothing, you've got no job, So do it when you wake up, do it when you go to sleep, doing it while you're eating, doing it while you're traveling, doing it while you're on the bicycle, doing it while you're sitting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, every time.

**Speaker A:** Every time, every time you remember. Yeah, yeah. The more you do it, the more often you'll remember. Okay, all right, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you, Skype too. Join the groups. Yeah, we got Sangha groups. Yeah, okay, great. All right, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** All right, take care. Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the primary speaker (Dhammarato) offers a critical review of S.N. Goenka's Vipassana meditation technique, contrasting it with what he presents as the Buddha's direct teachings from the suttas. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Critique of Goenka's Method:**
1.  **Misinterpretation of Ānāpānasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):** The speaker argues Goenka reverses the Buddha's instruction. The sutta (MN 118) explicitly starts with consciously breathing long and deep breaths to train and calm the mind. Goenka's instruction to "just watch" the natural breath without any control is seen as backward and less effective for initial concentration.
2.  **Body Scanning vs. Satipaṭṭhāna:** Goenka's systematic, sequential body scan is contrasted with the more fluid and responsive mindfulness of the body described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta. The speaker states the real purpose of body contemplation is to **find and release tension** to make the body comfortable, not just to observe sensations in a fixed order while ignoring urgent signals like pain.
3.  **The Problem of "Strong Determination" and Pain:** Goenka's "strong determination" sittings, where students are instructed to sit motionless through pain, are heavily criticized. The speaker argues this **creates more *dukkha* (suffering)** instead of removing it, which is the Buddha's core goal. It fosters pride, endurance of pain, and ego, rather than wisdom and release.
4.  **Missing the Goal of Sukha (Happiness/Ease):** The Buddha's path is about moving from *dukkha* to *sukha*—from dissatisfaction to satisfaction, ease, and comfort. Goenka's method, by emphasizing equanimity toward pain, is seen as teaching people to tolerate suffering, not to end it. True practice should make one feel "safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied" in the present moment.

### **The Speaker's Presentation of "Correct" Practice:**
1.  **Immediate Relief from Dukkha:** The essence of the practice is **immediate**. When you see *dukkha* (in body or mind), you change it *right now*. If your knee hurts, adjust your posture. If your mind is anxious, cultivate a wholesome thought. The formula is: See suffering → Stop it → Cultivate ease.
2.  **The Simile of the Snake (MN 22):** This sutta is used as a metaphor. Grasping the Dhamma incorrectly (like grabbing a snake by the tail) will get you bitten (create more suffering). Grasping it correctly (securing the head) makes it safe and useful. Goenka's method, by causing pain, is "the Dhamma biting you."
3.  **Right Effort is Redirection, Not Suppression:** Right Effort is not about brute force or stopping thoughts. It is the **minimal effort to redirect** the mind from unwholesome to wholesome states. Use simple, kind internal dialogue like "Never mind," "Let it go," or "Everything is okay" to steer the mind toward ease.
4.  **The Integrated Practice of the Eightfold Path:** The talk emphasizes the interplay of:
    *   **Sati (Mindfulness):** Remembering to look.
    *   **Right View:** Actively investigating (*looking at*) what is happening.
    *   **Right Effort:** Making the immediate change based on what you see.
    This cycle—look, see *dukkha*, change it—is the core of the speaker's Vipassana.

### **Practical Advice Given:**
*   **Abandon the "wrong practice"** of painful, rigid sitting.
*   **Practice correctly in short, frequent sessions** (e.g., 15 minutes, 6-8 times a day).
*   **Focus on breathing long and deep** to calm the mind.
*   **Use mindfulness to relax the body** and release tension wherever it is found.
*   **Cultivate wholesome thoughts of ease and satisfaction** in the present moment.

### **Overall Message:**
The Dhamma is meant to be **"good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end."** Any practice that promotes enduring pain as a virtue is a misinterpretation. The true path is one of increasing ease, comfort, and happiness by intelligently and immediately abandoning suffering whenever it arises in body or mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A) uses several powerful metaphors and stories to critique the Goenka meditation technique and illustrate their interpretation of the Buddha's core teachings.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Gym / Bodybuilder Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To criticize the intensity and premature difficulty of Goenka's "strong determination" sittings.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker compares proper meditation training to starting at a gym with light weights and many repetitions to build health gradually. Goenka's method is likened to a beginner immediately trying to lift heavy weights (100 kilos) to be like the pros, which leads to strain and injury. This illustrates the harm in giving students "advanced work" from the start.

### 2. **The Simile of the Snake (from MN 22)**
*   **Purpose:** This is the central story of the talk, used to frame the entire critique. It illustrates the danger of misapplying the Dharma (teachings).
*   **How it's used:** The Buddha taught that to safely catch a snake (the Dharma), you must pin its head and hold it so its mouth is closed. If you grasp it incorrectly, it will bite you. The speaker argues that Goenka's method is a wrong grasp—it causes the "snake" (the practice) to "bite" the practitioner by creating more *dukkha* (suffering) instead of alleviating it. Correct practice should be "good in the beginning, middle, and end," not painful.

### 3. **The Ship Without Brakes**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the correct approach to managing the mind, countering the idea that one should forcibly stop thoughts.
*   **How it's used:** A large ship (like an aircraft carrier) has no brakes. You can't stop it abruptly; you must steer it early and gently to change course. Similarly, you can't forcibly stop the mind's habits. Instead, you use awareness (*sati*) to notice its direction and gently redirect it toward wholesome thoughts ("everything is okay") through "right noble effort."

### 4. **The Broken Arm in a Sling**
*   **Purpose:** To contrast the Buddha's approach to healing with Goenka's approach to pain.
*   **How it's used:** When you have a broken arm, you put it in a cast and sling to immobilize it, allowing it to heal naturally. This represents the Buddha's teaching: listen to the body's pain and take compassionate action to relieve it. Goenka's "strong determination" is portrayed as the opposite: forcing the arm to be still and used despite the pain, which hinders healing and creates more suffering.

### 5. **The "Dukkha Rat Hole"**
*   **Purpose:** A vivid image to criticize meditation systems that over-emphasize analyzing suffering.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker warns that by focusing only on observing pain and *dukkha* without the intent to immediately alleviate it, practitioners can go "right down the **dukkha rat hole**"—a long, self-perpetuating process of dwelling in dissatisfaction, which is contrary to the Buddha's goal of cessation.

### 6. **The Victim vs. Champion / Emperor**
*   **Purpose:** To describe the transformative shift in attitude that correct practice should bring.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker describes the journey from an attitude of a **victim** ("life is tough") to that of a **champion** or the **emperor of your own pile of dirt**. This shift happens by using awareness to change thoughts and conditions from stressful to peaceful, thereby becoming the "boss of your own life."

### 7. **Hand in the Fire (Insight Metaphor)**
*   **Purpose:** To critique the value of mere insight without behavioral change.
*   **How it's used:** Having an "insight" that fire is hot is useless if you keep putting your hand back in it. Similarly, in meditation, having repeated insights about suffering (*anicca*, *dukkha*) is pointless if you don't use that insight to **make an immediate change** to alleviate the suffering. The second "kick of a mule" teaches nothing new.

### Summary of Core Contrast (Implied Metaphor)
Underlying the entire talk is a **core contrasting metaphor**:
*   **Goenka's Method:** Meditation as **endurance training** or **pain tolerance**.
*   **The Speaker's Interpretation of Buddha's Method:** Meditation as **immediate healing** and **cultivation of ease** (*sukkha*).

These metaphors and stories collectively build the argument that the Buddha's path is about the immediate cessation of suffering through wise attention and adjustment, not about passively enduring pain in the name of equanimity.
