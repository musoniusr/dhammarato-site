### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so it's Saturday morning here in Thailand and it's Friday evening in the States. And today's topic is going to be about the way people think. And that the way that we'll get started with this is, have you ever heard of the expression that if you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, and if you teach a man to fish, he can eat for his lifetime. Have you heard that? Yes. Okay. Yes. Here's the problem with that. What if the guy doesn't like fish? What if in fact he's never had fish? What about, in fact, that fishing is common and people who fish eat fish? And so you're a fisherman, you give him a fish, and he may not like it, so he's not going to learn to fish very well. In fact, you can't teach him to fish unless he really wants to learn to fish. Now that's basically where we're going with all of this, is that the things that people are taught throughout our lives often interfere with our ability to think straight. Why? Because if we're taught to think crooked, we think crooked, because that's the habit pattern that we've gotten into. And so let's introduce a topic, and we're going to call the topic belief. And people believe all kinds of things. Everybody here has a few beliefs. We can also call these beliefs opinions. And generally, all the things that we believe have been borrowed or stolen from someone else. That very, very rarely do we make stuff up and then hold to it. We'll make stuff up, and then we'll make some more stuff, and then we'll make some more stuff up, and we've forgotten all about the first thing that we made up. But when we're told something over and over and over again without any evidence at all, it becomes a belief. And believing things is a direct hindrance to being able to see clearly. And in fact, when I was a monk in the United States, I would often deal with Christians that I was involved with some inter-religious stuff because they would invite us, you know. You know, like at Thanksgiving, they wanted all the religions to be there. And so I was the Buddhist that spoke English, and so I got to go places, and invariably they would ask questions about what I believe in. And I developed a very short answer to that: I don't believe in belief. I believe in knowledge. I believe in reality. I believe in investigation, I don't believe in belief. And belief is the one thing that does interfere most strongly with the real change model that the Buddha has, that in fact, in order to change, we often have to drop our beliefs, because reality and seeing reality interferes with what we believe. And so people who have belief systems are hard to change. For instance, it's hard to teach a man to fish if he don't like fish, and maybe he's never had any fish, and he won't even eat the fish that you gave him, never mind teaching him to fish, because his grandfather got sick one time eating fish. And so he won't eat fish, because he's afraid of it. Well, if grandfather gets sick off of fish, within a couple of generations fish are going to be a terrible thing, that in fact we're going to write rules, "Thou shalt not eat fish." And I mean, some religions have that kind of stuff. You can't eat, what, prawns or shellfish or something like that. You can't eat pork here and there. Why they have these rules— and these rules got started because way back when somebody's grandpa got sick, and so you can't eat it anymore. And these become religious rules because of basically how many generations people have believed it. The longer your gen— uh, you know, time after time after time, generation after generation after generation, the way that people behave and the way that they teach their children are, are, um, let us say, ingrains it even more. You could say that somehow or another it kind of gets into our DNA. And the more generations that practice that stuff, the more deeply ingrained in the DNA it gets. Hey David, good to see you. All right, so there is absolutely no end to beliefs. I will tell— I will talk about it like this. Reality, as vast as reality is, is minuscule in comparison to the possible things that people can believe that are not true. Okay, truth is small and lies are huge. Let's give an example of that. Michael, how old are you? 29. All right, now I'll ask you again how old you are, but this time lie to me. Okay, I'm 35. All right, lie to me again. How old are you? I'm 22. Okay, lie to me again. How old are you? I'm 111. All right, you haven't even gone anywhere near what I would say. How old are you? I'm a trillion years old. All right, now we're getting someplace. Okay, this is what we mean by grandiosity. Okay, we make stuff up and we teach each other to make stuff up. Let me give you an example of a word. Have you ever heard of the word incredible? Do they use it on the internet? Almost everything that they say is incredible. Well, the funny thing about the word incredible is that it's the announcement that I'm about to lie to you. This is incredible, and then they talk about it. Well, if it's not credible, that means then that it cannot be believed, because it's not true. It's not credible. It's got no credibility, right? And so if what he says is in fact a fact, then it's not incredible. Any way that it is, he's lying to you. So be careful about the kind of words that you use, otherwise you will become incredible. So, what then is grandiosity? Grandiosity is making something bigger than it actually is, and that we do that primarily because feeling words don't express our feelings very well. So when I say, "I'm shy," or, "The girl is shy," we almost always say, "She's very shy," rather than just saying, "She's shy." We add stuff to it. We make things bigger than they are. Well, if this generation's parents teach the children and teach them things are bigger than they actually are, then they grow up and teach their kids even bigger than what they imagined from their parents. And every generation, it builds on it and gets worse and worse and worse, to the point that 2,000 years ago, somebody got sick off of seafood. And now the entire culture can't eat seafood, shell food, or whatever. The same thing is true with pork. That one time thousands of years ago, Grandpa got sick because of uncooked pork. He caught trichinosis, got a great big worm. And here we are 2,000 years later, and more than a billion people on planet Earth refuse to eat pork. That's because of this buildup of grandiosity and the possibility of belief, which means we believe things that we have been told. And so, Ross, it's really interesting that you ask the question of what is Where does thought come from? The answer to that is that we're taught to think. What was the very first thought? I don't know. But we do know that animals do some thinking, dogs do some thinking. That in fact, something very interesting that I've noticed about Lucky, who is sitting right here with me, Whenever I put the headphones on, if she's anywhere around, she'll come to sit down with me. But if I'm sitting at the computer and I don't have the headphones on, that means that I'm not going to be scratching and loving her and picking on her and petting her. But if I got the headphones on, that means that I'm about to talk to people. How did she figure that out? Was that a thought? Was it a dog thought?

**Speaker B:** There's, um, in, in, in terms of thoughts, you know, there's sometimes, you know, you could be, you have these random thoughts that just, that just come out, you know, they just come out of nowhere. And then you have these thoughts where you think you intentionally have made the thought. And is that still, is that still an illusion? You know, is it just all just random my, you know, random crazy thoughts? You know, is it just a phenomena that just continuously happens and thinking about where they come from is just leading you nowhere?

**Speaker A:** Well, we have several examples that we can use. One would be Freud talked about it in the sense of free association, that he would have his clients come in and relax and sit on the couch, and he'd have a notepad and he'd take down what they said, and he developed the idea that the free association means that the mind just jumps all over the place. Well, Buddhism has known about that for centuries. We've had this concept of monkey mind, that the monkey mind just jumps and jumps and jumps and jumps. Now, someplace buried in there is some sort of cause-effect relationship. Okay, so we see a bluebird and we think of blue, and then we see the sky is blue, and then we want a blue dress, and then we want a red dress, and now we will see red. Okay, and there was a logical connection with each one, but by the time you go 3 or 4 steps in the connection is lost. That in fact, Freud was not able to keep up with the connections. That this is actually an exercise that you can do. The next time that you have a conversation with someone, and that it goes to the end of the conversation, can you back up through the topics that were talked about, in that conversation. And you keep track of what your conversations are. If you can begin to keep track of what happens in a conversation, then that'll give you the basic skills to begin to track what your mind has been doing in the past hour. Because it's just been jumping all over the place. It changes the topic on a regular basis. We'll lay in bed and we'll see something on the internet or on the YouTube, and we see food, we start thinking about food, and then we think about going to the kitchen, and then we think about, oh, that pot is broken, I've got to go buy a new pot. And so we wind up at Sears and Roebuck or wherever we go shopping, and now we're looking at other stuff. And all of that happens while we're sitting there thinking in bed, and we're not even watching the video anymore. The same thing happens when we're reading a book, that we'll read the book, it'll have a line that we like, and we start thinking about it, and now the book is going down here and the eyes are going right through the book, but the mind has been jumping all over the place, kind of thinking about something that we read 3, 4 pages ago. This is the monkey mind. Okay, now if the monkey mind has a lot of beliefs, then he's going to wind up jumping in and out of his belief systems while he is thinking. Also, all the stuff that we have learned in this, in the association of beliefs will be visited in and out. Okay, so as the mind is moving around and moving in and out of beliefs, that would actually interfere with being able to think logically. And thinking logically, thinking consistently, This is, by the way, what we could use with the word concentration that's so popular in Buddhism, and think about it instead to be something like consistency, that the mind doesn't jump around, it kind of stays on topic. So when mom tells the kid to concentrate on her homework, what that really means is not for the child to struggle and look like that she's working hard, which is what most concentration looks like, and instead she's actually able to finish her homework one item at a time because she's staying consistent on the homework. Okay, so the more things that one believes that are not true or has no evidence the more likely the mind is going to jump around in and out of that belief system. That in fact, you could go so far— and this is really the main subject that we can talk about— is our belief and what we believe in interferes with our reality. What we believe in interferes with our ability to do things correctly. Why? Because belief is something that we have been taught by others, often over and over and over and over again, that often gets in the way of our clear thinking. Which means then that children who were raised in religious households— and I won't define religion, I'll leave it loose for you to understand, but the more religious the household is, then the more stupid the children are. That brilliant people grow up in a household where they're not confined and constricted by a set of beliefs. Or in some cases, if the child is put into some situation like that, he finds ways to get out of the box. He doesn't get trapped in it. Okay, one of the things that I noticed when I was in school in various small towns in South Carolina were that the kids often were pretty stupid. In fact, the more often that they went to church the more likely they were to be stupid. But I did run across several kids, some of them in higher grades than I were, were really, really sharp. They were smart, they were mathematicians, they really knew stuff. And guess what? They didn't go to church. So church often puts boxes around the kids. Now, my family was such that My mother was gung-ho Baptist, and her family was, but my dad was not. And but he found a way of getting along. In fact, I just remember telling Michael this story the other day about how my dad never taught me anything about religion, never opened the Bible, never told me anything like that. He went to church on every Sunday morning, but his behavior spoke volumes to me. And what was his behavior? He actually, in not just one but in several churches, he had a system to where he would talk to the preacher to be able to get to the preacher's sermons recorded. This is back in the 1950s when recorded sermons were rare. And so every preacher would buy into it. Yeah, I want my sermons recorded. And so my dad would have the machinery in the back room, have the microphones set up in the sanctuary, and then my dad would turn on the tape recorders. And during that time, during the sermon, during that hour of services, he'd go to the bar. And then he would come back to the bar just in time to turn the machine off at the end of the services, because all of that stuff was timed, you know, it was always about 11 o'clock on Sunday morning and it finishes at 12 o'clock. And so, every Sunday, he would be in the bar. Actually, in Oklahoma, it was a newsstand, but they sold alcohol in the newsstand. I remember, because I was a little kid, and he'd take me with him on many occasions, and I would read the comic books, Little Lulu, and that sort of thing. So, what I'm pointing you to here is that my dad interfered directly in a huge way with my religious education. He interfered bigly, and boy am I glad that he did. He gave me the freedom to experiment, but none of the other kids in town had that freedom.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on **how belief systems and ingrained thought patterns obstruct clear thinking and genuine understanding**, using the Buddha's teachings as a framework.

**Core Summary:**

The talk begins with a twist on the proverb, "Give a man a fish..." The point is that teaching someone is ineffective if they aren't open to the lesson, often due to **pre-existing beliefs** they've inherited. Dhammarato argues that most beliefs are borrowed, not investigated, and are passed down through generations—sometimes originating from simple, ancient causes (e.g., a food taboo starting because someone's ancestor got sick).

**Key Themes:**

1.  **Belief vs. Knowledge/Investigation:** Dhammarato sharply contrasts belief (accepting something without evidence) with knowledge gained through investigation of reality. He states, "I don't believe in belief. I believe in knowledge... belief is the one thing that does interfere most strongly with the real change model that the Buddha has."
2.  **Grandiosity & Distortion:** Beliefs become exaggerated over time ("grandiosity"), distorting our perception. Language like "incredible" or "very shy" inflates reality, and this magnification compounds across generations, solidifying unexamined rules.
3.  **The "Monkey Mind":** In response to a question about random thoughts (Speaker B), Dhammarato explains the restless, associative nature of the mind (comparable to Freud's free association). A mind cluttered with beliefs jumps chaotically between these mental constructs, hindering logical, consistent thought.
4.  **Concentration as Consistency:** He re-frames Buddhist "concentration" (*samadhi*) not as strained effort, but as **consistency**—the ability to stay on topic without the mind jumping around. A belief-laden mind is inherently inconsistent.
5.  **Beliefs Enslave, Freedom Enlightens:** Dhammarato contends that rigid belief systems (often religious) make people less intelligent ("the more religious the household is, then the more stupid the children are") by boxing in their thinking. True brilliance or clarity comes from the freedom to investigate reality without dogma. He illustrates this with a personal story of his father subtly subverting religious indoctrination, giving him the space to think for himself.

**Conclusion:**

The central message is that for genuine insight and change (as taught by the Buddha), we must recognize and **suspend our borrowed beliefs**. Clear thinking and seeing reality (*yathābhūta*) require a mind free from the distorting, jumpy influence of unexamined opinions, allowing for consistent, investigative attention. The path to wisdom is through inquiry, not inherited dogma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about belief, thinking, and conditioning:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Give a man a fish..." (The Modified Fishing Metaphor):**
    *   This is the central, extended metaphor. The speaker starts with the common proverb ("teach a man to fish...") but immediately subverts it to make a new point: you can't effectively teach someone a skill (like fishing) if they have no desire or context for it (if they don't like or have never had fish). This becomes a metaphor for how **pre-existing beliefs and conditioning (a dislike of fish) prevent genuine learning and clear thinking.**

2.  **"Thinking Crooked":**
    *   A simple metaphor contrasting "thinking straight" (clear, logical perception of reality) with "thinking crooked" (distorted by inherited beliefs and opinions). It frames belief as a mental habit that warps perception.

3.  **"Grandiosity" as Making Things Bigger:**
    *   The speaker uses "grandiosity" as a metaphor for how beliefs and language inflate over time. A single event (Grandpa getting sick) becomes a universal rule ("Thou shalt not eat fish/pork") over generations. This illustrates how small truths or incidents become enormous, ingrained cultural or religious prohibitions.

4.  **"Monkey Mind":**
    *   A classic Buddhist metaphor adopted by the speaker to describe the restless, jumping, associative nature of untrained thought. It's compared to Freud's "free association." The metaphor emphasizes how the mind leaps from topic to topic without consistent focus.

5.  **"Boxes" (and "Getting Out of the Box"):**
    *   A common metaphor for restrictive belief systems, particularly religious dogma. The speaker states that religious households put "boxes around the kids," constricting thought. "Smart" people are those not confined by these boxes or who find ways to "get out of the box."

6.  **"Incredible" as a Signal of Falsehood:**
    *   The speaker plays with the literal meaning of the word ("not credible") as a metaphor for how language can betray dishonesty or exaggeration. If something is presented as "incredible," it is, by definition, not believable—a metaphor for the grandiosity in everyday communication.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Story of Religious Food Taboos (Pork/Shellfish):**
    *   This is a recurring illustrative story. The speaker hypothesizes that major religious dietary laws (e.g., prohibitions against pork or shellfish) originated from a simple, forgotten historical cause: someone's ancestor got sick from eating improperly prepared food. The story is used to show how **a practical, one-time cause evolves through "grandiosity" and generational belief into a sacrosanct, universal rule.**

2.  **The Anecdote about Being a Monk and Christians:**
    *   The speaker tells a personal story of being asked about his beliefs by Christians during inter-religious events. His punchline, "I don't believe in belief. I believe in knowledge... investigation," is a story that encapsulates his core thesis: belief is a hindrance to seeing reality.

3.  **The Interactive Example with Michael (Age Guessing):**
    *   This is a live, conversational story used to demonstrate the concept of "grandiosity." By asking Michael to lie about his age repeatedly (29, 35, 22, 111, a trillion), the speaker shows how the realm of falsehood ("lies are huge") is infinitely larger and more grandiose than the simple truth ("truth is small").

4.  **The Story of His Father and the Church Recordings:**
    *   This is a detailed personal narrative. The story of his father technically serving the church (recording sermons) but physically and symbolically absent (going to the bar/newsstand) serves as a powerful example of **"interfering" with religious indoctrination.** The father's actions, not his words, created a "box"-free space for the young speaker, allowing him the "freedom to experiment" with thought.

5.  **The Observation About His Dog, Lucky:**
    *   This brief story about his dog learning to associate headphones with attention is used to pose a philosophical question about the nature of thought. It serves as a bridge between human and animal cognition, questioning where "thought" begins and whether patterned association (like the dog's) constitutes thinking.

**In summary,** the speaker uses the **modified fishing metaphor** and the **story of evolving food taboos** as his primary frameworks. He supports these with the **"monkey mind"** and **"boxes"** metaphors, and personal stories from his life as a monk and his childhood to argue that **beliefs are inherited mental habits that distort reality, hinder clear thinking, and are perpetuated through language and generational grandiosity.**
