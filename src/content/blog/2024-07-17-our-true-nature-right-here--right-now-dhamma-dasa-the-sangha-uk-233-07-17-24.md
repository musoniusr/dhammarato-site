### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So for anybody who just popped in, we're just hanging out, we're just friends talking. If you have things you want to talk about, about the Dharma practice, the Buddha, feel free to chime in. If not, I'll just lecture about the Dhamma in between the silence. So yeah, we're just hanging out, so feel free to speak whatever's on your mind.

**Speaker B:** I have something in mind. It's just interesting how I have to catch myself every time I judge myself. I guess sometimes I have a standard and say, well, I understood the Dharma enough that judgment won't come because I know it's unproductive. But despite doing my best of my understanding, it still comes. And I think the key is just catching it. I catch so much, and I'm just able to relax.

**Speaker A:** What are you judging? Are you judging yourself?

**Speaker B:** It's kind of like the first and second arrow. Kind of similarly, where the first arrow is me judging myself. And before the second arrow comes, which is judging myself for judging myself, I have to catch it and just say, yeah, it's all right, everything is okay. Like, I can't blame myself too much. This is an old habit of mine. So yeah, I've been doing that a lot. It's almost like I come to terms with the fact that it's impossible to catch that first arrow. But I can catch a second arrow. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Anybody want to comment on what he was saying about judgment and the arrow analogies?

**Speaker C:** Sometimes I just like, like my self-worth doesn't depend on You know, fill in the blank, what other people think doesn't depend on my ability to control circumstances, it doesn't depend on my status, whatever.

**Speaker A:** Very good.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Anybody else?

**Speaker D:** Not really, but just I think it's something that's deeply ingrained in everybody's mind. I think we all judge. Maybe some of us tend to judge ourselves in different ways, and maybe we're a bit kinder to ourselves, or maybe we're even judging ourselves a bit overconfidently. You know, which can lead to arrogance and stuff. But I guess it seems like it's deeply inherent in the human condition. And yeah, I find the practice that we learn from Buddhadasa and Dhammarato, that opportunity to really uproot those unwholesome thoughts and really be proactive in it rather than just noting the judgment, you sort of start to, you know, base a different view of yourself around reality, right? It's not just positive thinking, it's around the actual truth that things are okay in this moment, um, you know, um, so that's what helps me is that it's not just positive thinking, it's it's actually true if you investigate it at its core. So that's well said. It's definitely something I have to address.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because a lot of times the toxic positivity, it's just putting the makeup on the pig. You know what I mean? It's like the makeup's nice. It does make the pig a little prettier, but it's still a pig. But like we use positivity, but yeah, like you were saying, it's the truth of what's actually going on. Because 9 times out of 10, the truth is there isn't a tiger attacking us, there isn't a bear attacking us, there isn't a person attacking us. It just started, I don't know what that is. But anyways, the truth is we're just okay. Everything's fine right where we are, right where we sit. There's nothing to worry about. No place to go, nothing to do.

**Speaker C:** You can experience verbal attacks, the harsh criticisms in the morning, not a physical attack, but kind of an attack on your psychological in a way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That'S very well said. I think for my condition, just usually I said this, I'm kind of really aware of what triggers it. There's certain situation that could trigger it and certain situation that I won't feel as much judgment as it is used to. I was just thinking like I was just thinking in terms of the Dharma, is it a skillful thing? Is it a worthwhile thing? Is it worthwhile to think about the situation before it happens? Like for me, it usually happens due to work. 9 out of 10 times it's always work. And there's a lot of judgment revolving around that. I'm not sure. I don't think it's skillful, maybe, because just thinking about it is maybe I'm just anticipating bad things from happening. Maybe I just have to be aware. I'm not sure. Oh, hi, Michael.

**Speaker F:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** Hi.

**Speaker A:** Hi guys. Anybody who's just joining, welcome. Michael, welcome.

**Speaker B:** Can I? Yeah, I want to ask my question again since Michael is here. I was just thinking, Is it skillful or unskillful to contemplate about? It's like playing the tape through the end. Like, let's say I usually get very triggered when it comes to my work performance. Unfortunately, it's still something Nirodha does. I was just thinking, is it worthwhile to to anticipate problems that may occur, that may trigger something in me, or should I just, you know, don't just let it be, you know, whatever happens happens? I don't know. Like in terms of the Dharma, like maybe it's not skillful.

**Speaker F:** Well, there's a way for that to be skillful and there's a way for it to be unskillful. It's skillful if you contemplate things that you're still— like when you go to buy a house and you do like an environmental review of the landscape and it tells you that the house is in a flood zone and then you decide, okay, I'm not going to buy this house because it's in a flood zone, it's subject to flooding, right? Or You go to buy your beautiful dream homestead in the mountains and you find out that that area gets wildfire every year. So you think, okay, it's not a good place to buy a house. So contemplating different components of your experience that are still subject to suffering or liable to suffering is good in the sense that you know that there's like work to be done in those areas. But if it just kind of becomes a proliferation of making up potential problems, then it's possible that craving has co-opted the practice in order to keep you, you know, stuck in this cycle of dissatisfaction because cravings you know, only seeks its own existence, its own perpetuation. And it does that by keeping you in a state of dissatisfaction, keeping you off balance. So yeah, there's a subtle sort of balance point in your question there. As I mentioned before, you can, if you're like contemplating, like in the practice of Mara Anapanasati, contemplation of death.

**Speaker B:** When.

**Speaker F:** Most, most of the time when we contemplate death, we contemplate our concept of death. And it's not really a real contemplation of death because the actual experience of dying is like a slow degradation of your sense faculties, your memory, losing everything that you've held dear your whole life. So in order to really, really contemplate death, you have to kind of think about what it's like to lose all of those things bit by bit, to lose your hearing, to lose your vision, to lose your memories, to lose control over caring for the people you love, to see how the mind responds to that. You can see where there's deep clinging still hidden in the mind. But to do that, you need a calm, clear mind to do that. So you don't want to put the cart before the horse. And in the practice that we do in this group here in the Sangha, and that Dhammarato teaches as the Noble Dhamma, is to make them, you know, get the mind into a state of satisfaction. And that lines up really well with the Seven Enlightenment Factors, you know, get the mind happy and satisfied. And that happy, satisfied mind then sees things more clearly. And then when you see things more clearly, that leads to disenchantment. And then that disenchantment leads to dispassion. That dispassion leads to relinquishment, or the giving up of ownership of of all of these things that you take to be who you are and yours, like me and mine, essentially. So again, it starts with a mind that is confident, happy, satisfied, and clear. And you want to use that mind—Buddhadasa calls that mind the mind that is fit for work—you want to use that mind to then contemplate where you're still liable to suffering.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** But it's never a bad idea to just remember the simple practice of remembering to be here now, remembering to be satisfied, remembering this is good enough. Because if you keep practicing that, that will put the mind into a clear state, and that clear seeing will start uprooting that liability to suffering almost on its own. So I would say approach it that way. Don't worry about— don't use worry because that worry is coming from more of a deluded state than a clear state of seeing things as they are.

**Speaker B:** Because it's still rooted in dissatisfaction and the ignorance in thinking dissatisfaction can bring me to satisfaction.

**Speaker F:** If you look at the traditional structure, even with stream entry, you know, the three lower fetters are broken: your attachment to rights, rules, and rituals, your attachment to your self-image, the narrative self or the autobiographical self, as I like to call it, and then doubt about what to do. That's broken, you know that what needs to be done is to see dissatisfaction and throw it out. But craving and ill will are still left. So even though you have that satisfied mind that no longer identifies with the way things should be or who I think I am, that still the old habits will still come up. You still respond to pleasant things with craving and unpleasant things with with not liking. So there's still work to be done, but now you have a mind that is fit for work. So if the type of stuff you're worried about as triggers is what you're being concerned with, well, you're just kind of keeping your mind clouded by worrying about them. So I think, yeah, I think the best advice is just to kind of go back to the core practice of remembering to be satisfied, remembering that this is good enough. Building that new habit, as Dhammarato says, that new habit of being satisfied rather than being dissatisfied, to calm the mind down, clear it up, and then use that clear mind to then see what needs to be uprooted at a deeper level.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yeah, understood.

**Speaker D:** Very good.

**Speaker A:** Anybody else have anything they want to add on that?

**Speaker B:** What should we talk about today? Perfect. Is the call, is the call being recorded already? I haven't seen it.

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato, you might— I feel like you might be— you might have good advice to give to the whataboutisms of the mind. You know what I'm talking about? Like when the mind gets satisfied in the early stages of the practice, and then you think, well, what about this? What about that? And, you know, and people— in the case of people who come from.

**Speaker B:** A.

**Speaker F:** More studious background, I'll say, so what about the sutta? Or what about when the Buddha says it this way? Or what about sense restraint? Or what about, you know, what about the precepts? Or what about stream entry? And what about— and then for other people, it's like, well, what about social activism? And what about people in jail? Or, you know, all of those what-abouts that the mind comes up with to keep the mind in the state Anapanasati, dissatisfaction. I feel like that's where I see and hear and have experienced the most hangups in practicing, starting with right view, starting with the super mundane path. I see most people kind of get tripped up in that what about and the but. What would you say to that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what a— yeah, there's always, just like there's always a myriad of things to be— to find fault with, there's a myriad of things to, to ask about, to say, what about this, what about that? And that's the major, that's the major issue I would say with a lot of people, even some seasoned practitioners.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just do whatever they want to do. Well, ask Mommy, ask what she wants to do. So there's always a myriad of things to say, but what about this, but what about that? And for the beginners, for the seasoned practitioners, just satisfaction. Dukkha is wanting things to be different than the way they are, wanting things that we don't have right now. And that 'but what about this, but what about that' is the first step into the realm of Samsara, because we're not satisfied with the way things are. We have questions, we have over-intellectualizations.

**Speaker B:** We.

**Speaker A:** Have all these myriad of desires and things. And I like to tell people, can you be okay with the way things are? Can you be okay that you don't have all the answers? Can you be okay that reality doesn't really care about you, doesn't want to.

**Speaker B:** Give you what you want?

**Speaker A:** Can you be okay that society may look down on you for certain things? Family members, friends may look down on you for trivial, stupid things that don't matter— classism, racism, sexism, whatever, whatever it may be. It could just be your personality, you know. You cannot— you can't escape this stuff. You can't escape, uh, society. The only, the only way you can let it go or escape it is to let it go. Let go of being under the stranglehold of their judgment, the stranglehold of your own judgment, and let things rest gently as they are. Discover your true nature. And I could tell you what your true nature is. Your true nature is not a mystery. It's not a Rubik's Cube. It's just letting things go. That's your true nature. Dhammarato used to say this. He doesn't say it much anymore. Hopefully he'll bring it back. But he used to say We must cultivate the Teflon mind, like the Teflon pans, or the oiled pan, or the oiled rock. Everything slips off it. It bounces right off. It slips right off. So develop a Teflon mind. Oh, I wish I had more answers. Well, who cares? Let it slip right off. Oh, I wish I was this.

**Speaker B:** Slip.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I wish reality was like this. Everything's Anicca, Dukkha, Nata. It's not worth holding on to. Status within a Sangha, status within a society, status within your own mind. It's not important, it's all a joke. Can you be satisfied with four walls in a room by yourself in silence? Can you be satisfied in a forest in silence? Can you be satisfied as a family man or family woman? Can you be satisfied as an Abbot of some wat or whatever? You know, call yourself whatever the fuck you want. King of France, can you be satisfied? Titles don't matter, labels don't matter. Labels, titles, class— this person's better than this person— just like here now, there's nobody more special than anybody else. We're all the same. We all are Buddhas, we all are enlightened. We're just helping each other get rid of our ignorance. Of that very particular thing we're talking about. But what about this? But what about that? There is no buts. There's just letting go of all of it and discovering your true nature. That's what Bodhidharma, the Zen master, the grandfather of all Zen, was famous for bringing Zen Buddhism from India to China. He was all about discovering your true nature.

**Speaker C:** What was the guy's name?

**Speaker A:** Bodhidharma.

**Speaker F:** Arya.

**Speaker A:** There's a great book I have of him. It's called The Zen Teachings of Bodhidharma and translated by Red Pine. And it's a great book.

**Speaker B:** Great book.

**Speaker C:** The Shaolin Temple.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the Shaolin monks, they claim that their lineage goes back to Bodhidharma. And you could see it too, because he was Indian, and a lot of their— especially in their stretching for their kung fu, it looks very similar to the Hindu yoga of all different types. So it's funny, you could see the stuff if you look with like.

**Speaker F:** Uh.

**Speaker A:** Uh, clear eyes, you know. Everything's related.

**Speaker C:** A lot of martial arts studios have a picture of Bodhidharma on a wall even though they don't really follow Buddhism. That's part of the, uh, it's part of their, you know, lineage. And he has a semi-legendary Anagami status.

**Speaker F:** As they refer to it as.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's amazing. And that's why, that's why it's good to get involved with, with people who might be even more recent than the Buddha, even though Bodhidharma is like, I think, 500 years or so, maybe 1,000 after Buddha. I'm not quite sure, but, but we have Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, you know, we have Dhammarato, but also we have this moment right here, right now, and we can discover our true nature right here, right now, which is complete peace, complete emptiness, complete satisfaction.

**Speaker C:** According to legend, Buddha, Dharma, somebody wanted to be his disciple, but he wasn't impressed her. He needed like the guy to show that he was dedicated, so the guy cut off his arm. Oh yeah, he stood out in the snow and he was out waiting around in the cave all night, uh, in the snow. And Mudita said something like, uh, I need to see some blood. So he cut his arm off.

**Speaker E:** And I don't know if it's my Britishness and we're quite like indirect, right? But he was talking about like being a loser, you know, a winner and a loser. And I remember thinking like, oh, you can't call people losers in like this modern day, right? Like that's not politically correct. And so it took me a while to sort of to gauge it. But what's been really helpful, and I think this comes back to that question on like noting stuff versus making an active change is, it's amazing how when those emotions do come up, you buy into this fact that they are totally justified and that you have a right to feel that way. And so as a result, you don't actually change it. And I shared at the very beginning of this call, I'm actually in bed with fever.

**Speaker F:** Um, today.

**Speaker E:** And I noticed it even this morning, like, I was in a foul mood, and I thought, I've got a, I've got a right to be in a foul mood, right? Because I'm ill, and of course you have to be in a foul mood when you're ill. Like, that's just, that's, that's my right. Um, but it was just interesting because you're like, that's just a, it's, it's my victim mentality, right? Um, I've, I've put two and two together and thought, because I'm sick, I have to also be in a bad mood. And so it's amazing how pervasive that is in all aspects of life. When we get those emotions, we think that they're for a reason and that that's a justifiable reason, but it's just a fabrication at the end of the day that we've decided to interpret certain things in such a way, and we take ownership for that. So it's a hard truth, I think, this idea. The victim mentality is a hard truth, but it's an incredibly powerful one when you because it's so empowering, I guess, to really change your mind state and go beyond. You know, because I've been meditating for quite a few years now, but it was a lot more of a passive process in the past, just like accepting feeling crap and just hoping it'll, you know, at some point it will change. But you can actually be a lot more proactive, and that's been really, really beneficial.

**Speaker B:** Love that.

**Speaker A:** That's good, man. That's good, dude.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I mean, a lot of sitting meditation is sitting down, feeling sorry for yourself, and hoping to feel better. You know, it's on a subtle level. It's sitting down and wanting, waiting, wanting and waiting. It's like you're waiting for the bus to come, but the bus is not coming because you're not at the bus stop.

**Speaker B:** You know? Yeah.

**Speaker F:** But yeah, the attitude of being a loser or being a victim, especially nowadays, has so much social capital to it, you know. And being happy is like an offense to people. That's why Dhammarato talks about the idea of you have to work to eat. He's basically saying that we have this idea in our culture that you can't have something you didn't earn. So happiness is the biggest thing, right, in life. And the idea that you can be happy without earning it is like offensive to the rules of our culture. So that's what he's talking about there. And the idea that you have a right to feel sorry for yourself because something bad came up in your life— well, you know, bad things come up in everybody's lives, and there's always somebody worse off than you. So why sit around feeling like a victim? Because you know, some unwanted circumstance arose, you know, by its own cause.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker F:** There'S a story that I once shared with Dhammarato in regard to the victim versus winner. When I understood it, it's a silly story and, you know, it's.

**Speaker B:** A fable.

**Speaker F:** But it's like a man goes to work every day and every day at lunch he pulls out his ham sandwich and goes, oh man, a ham sandwich again. And week after week after week at lunch, ah, another ham sandwich. Oh, and finally his coworkers say to him, you know, why don't you ask your wife to make you a different sandwich? And the guy goes, what? I don't have a wife. I make my own sandwiches.

**Speaker A:** So that's hilarious, dude.

**Speaker F:** That's exactly what the victim's attitude is. Like, we, we experience these moods and emotions and like, oh, you know, poor me, why am I experiencing— and it's like You know, we're not realizing that we're just like doing that to ourselves. We're not taking responsibility for the fact that we are burying ourselves under a pile of crap instead of seeing the crap as crap and not burying ourselves in it or eating it or whatever metaphor you want to use. Ham sandwich. Make a different sandwich.

**Speaker A:** We make our own beds and then we lay in them and complain about it, you know.

**Speaker F:** It's easy to forget that this all refers to internal phenomena though. It all refers to attitude, you know. It has nothing to do with external conditions. I mean, it has a little bit to do with external conditions, you know. There are external things that you can change if you know they're unwholesome. But a lot of it is about— I would say 95% of it is about is about attitude. You know, it's sort of the forerunner to the moods and emotions you experience. If you have an attitude of everything's okay, you know, I could be satisfied with or without that thing, or, you know, there's not all problems or stuff that the mind makes up. And, you know, in its essence, if you really have that attitude, the mind inclines towards peace. Then your thoughts and your moods will change. You know, you're making different sandwiches, essentially.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, many things will arise and fall. And the Buddha said— oh, we had some, we had some issues with the recording or something. I saw on the Skype. So for anybody who's watching the video now, if it even gets published to YouTube or uploaded, the Buddha taught one thing and one thing only. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker B:** Letting go.

**Speaker A:** Remember to let go. Remember to look and change. And just like I'm doing now, remember to look if there's some geese.

**Speaker C:** Shit.

**Speaker A:** Gently step around it. Don't worry, be happy. And breathe in and relax. And that's all the practice you really need. Everything else is just kind of pissing in the wind. I thought I'd do a little review.

**Speaker F:** Everything else is sort of a concession to our habits of wanting things. So, you know, we're given promises of great states of meditation. We're given stories and concepts and ideas to let the mind chew on because it's used to As Dhammarato says, life sucks because you're sucking, so you have to do it because you're wanting, right? So we're used to sucking, so the Buddha gives us different things to suck on, and all the other Buddhas and teachers in the different traditions, they give us different things to suck on until we stop wanting things to suck on. That's why when you stop wanting things to suck on, you realize, you know, you don't even need the— you don't need the teachings. You just need to be okay with reality as it is. It's really bringing that fire to a cessation, that fire of wanting. Until you do that, you know, you're gonna keep wanting more teachings, you're gonna keep wanting more teachers, you're gonna keep wanting more things to think about and mull over and do. But, you know, it's just about bringing desire, or dissatisfaction I should say, to its end. It's being okay with what is, what's freely available. As Dhammarato says, like this breath or the smile, you know, the ability to let go. Those are all freely available right now. If you can be satisfied with that, then there's nothing else that's needed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, developing the Teflon mind of letting everything slip off of your pan, slip off of your oily slick rock, and just relaxing, you know, just relaxing, just chilling out. And anybody, you have any last questions before I let you go? Anybody, or any thoughts, or whatever?

**Speaker B:** Not much. I think this talk is so fascinating. I'm just reflecting on, I mentioned this to Dhammarato, is that I have this, there's this very dirty pleasure in feeling like a victim. I use guilty, maybe sounds very judgmental, but that's how I feel about it. Like, there's this pleasure in feeling like a victim. And I have to catch myself so often. Like, okay, like, it's happening again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the name of the game, you know? Catching it as it happens. Observing it as it appears, as it rises and falls. And saying, aha, I see you, Mara, you little bastard, Mara. And then you walk around it. You all have the ability. Yeah, you all walk outside, you all see shit, you all have the ability to walk around it. You just got to transfer it from the physical reality to in between your ears. And then you're fine. Sound good?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Alright dudes, I love you. Be friends with one another and go to opensanghafoundation.org, our website. Much peace and love dudes, call me if you need me.

**Speaker F:** It was good seeing you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you everyone.

**Speaker F:** Bye bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye dudes.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (likely Dhammarato or a facilitator)**, revolves around a central theme: **cultivating a mind of satisfaction and letting go as the core of the practice**, using everyday challenges as the training ground.

Here is a summary of the key points and progression of the discussion:

### Core Theme: From Judgment and Worry to Satisfaction and Letting Go

1.  **The Problem of Self-Judgment (The "Arrows"):**
    *   **Speaker B** opens by describing the persistent habit of self-judgment (the "first arrow") and then judging oneself for judging (the "second arrow"). The key insight is learning to catch and relax around these judgments, accepting them as old habits.

2.  **The Antidote: A Mind "Fit for Work":**
    *   The group agrees that simply noting judgment isn't enough. The proactive solution, drawn from the teachings of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Dhammarato, is to **establish a base of satisfaction and happiness** in the present moment. This isn't "toxic positivity" but recognizing the fundamental truth that, in this moment, things are fundamentally okay.
    *   A calm, happy, and satisfied mind is "fit for work"—it can see clearly and uproot unwholesome tendencies without being clouded by them.

3.  **Applying the Antidote to Anticipatory Anxiety:**
    *   **Speaker B** asks a practical question: Is it skillful to anticipate work-related triggers? **Speaker F (Michael)** provides a nuanced answer:
        *   **Unskillful:** If it becomes anxious proliferation fueled by craving and dissatisfaction.
        *   **Skillful:** If done with a clear, calm mind to see where one is still "liable to suffering," like a sensible review of potential problems.
    *   The recommended path is to **always return to the core practice**: remember to be satisfied now, let the mind become clear, and allow that clarity to naturally address vulnerabilities.

4.  **The "What About?" Mind and the "Teflon Mind":**
    *   **Speaker F** raises the common obstacle of the "what-about-ism" mind (e.g., "What about social justice?" "What about this sutta?"), which is a subtle form of dissatisfaction that keeps the mind trapped.
    *   **Speaker A** emphasizes that this questioning is the "first step into Samsara." The solution is to **develop a "Teflon mind"** where all concerns, statuses, labels, and intellectualizations simply slip away. The goal is to **discover one's "true nature"**—which is peace, emptiness, and satisfaction—by letting go of everything else.

5.  **Taking Responsibility: The "Ham Sandwich" Story:**
    *   **Speaker E** shares a personal insight about the "victim mentality"—the belief that difficult circumstances *justify* and require a foul mood (e.g., being sick).
    *   **Speaker F** reinforces this with a parable: A man complains daily about his ham sandwich, only to reveal he makes them himself. The point is that **we often manufacture our own dissatisfied mental states and then blame external conditions**. True practice is taking responsibility for our internal attitude, which is the forerunner of our mood.

### Conclusion & Practical Advice

*   The Buddha's teaching is summarized simply: **suffering and the end of suffering.** The practice is **letting go**.
*   The ultimate teaching is to **"be okay with reality as it is."** The breath, a smile, the ability to let go—these are freely available. Satisfaction with this ends the "fire of wanting."
*   The final encouragement is to see unwholesome mental states (Mara) as you would see geese poop on the ground: **acknowledge it ("aha, I see you") and gently walk around it.** Transfer this simple skill from the physical world to the space between your ears.

**In essence:** The talk guides practitioners from being caught in cycles of judgment and anxiety to establishing a foundational mind of satisfaction. From that stable, clear, and happy place, one can see through the mind's habits and stories, take responsibility for one's inner attitude, and let everything else slip away, realizing the peace that is always already here.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Dharma practice, judgment, and cultivating a satisfied mind.

Here are the main metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The First and Second Arrow:** Introduced by Speaker B, this is a classic Buddhist metaphor. The first arrow is the initial painful event (e.g., judging oneself). The second arrow is the subsequent, self-inflicted suffering (e.g., judging oneself *for* judging). The practice is about learning to catch and not fire the second arrow.

2.  **The Teflon Mind / Oiled Rock:** Introduced by Speaker A (attributed to Dhammarato). This metaphor describes a mind from which unwholesome thoughts, judgments, and cravings simply "slip off" without sticking, like food from a non-stick Teflon pan or water from an oiled rock.

3.  **Putting Makeup on a Pig:** Used by Speaker A to distinguish between genuine truth-based peace and "toxic positivity." The makeup (superficial positive thinking) might look nicer, but it doesn't change the underlying reality (the "pig").

4.  **Making Your Own Ham Sandwich:** Told by Speaker F, this story is a fable about the victim mentality. A man complains daily about his ham sandwich, only to reveal he makes it himself. The metaphor illustrates how we often create our own unsatisfactory mental states (the sandwich) and then blame external circumstances.

5.  **Walking Around Shit / Stepping Around Geese Shit:** Used multiple times by Speaker A. This is a vivid metaphor for the proactive aspect of the practice. You see an unwholesome thought or emotion (the "shit") arise, and instead of stepping in it or wallowing in it, you simply, gently, step around it.

6.  **The Mind Fit for Work:** Referenced by Speaker F (attributed to Buddhadasa). This describes a mind that is calm, happy, and satisfied. Only such a clear mind is truly capable of the profound investigative work of uprooting deeper suffering.

7.  **Sucking / Things to Suck On:** Used by Speaker F. He describes the mind's habit of craving as "sucking." Teachers give us practices and teachings ("things to suck on") to pacify this habit until we learn to stop "sucking" entirely and be satisfied with what is.

8.  **Waiting for a Bus at the Wrong Stop:** Used by Speaker F to describe passive meditation that is rooted in wanting. It's like waiting for peace (the bus) while standing in a state of dissatisfaction (the wrong stop). The bus (peace) won't come until you go to the correct stop (a state of satisfaction).

### **Stories & References**

1.  **Bodhidharma Legend:** Speaker A and C discuss Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen. They reference the (likely apocryphal) legend where a seeker (Hui Ke) cuts off his own arm to demonstrate his sincere dedication to becoming Bodhidharma's disciple. This story underscores the theme of radical commitment to discovering one's true nature.

2.  **The Environmental Review:** Used by Speaker F as an analogy for skillful contemplation. Before buying a house, checking for flood zones or wildfires is wise. Similarly, it can be skillful to contemplate areas of life where you are still "liable to suffering" *if* done with a clear, calm mind. This contrasts with unskillful worry, which is like obsessive, fear-based proliferation.

3.  **The Victim's "Right" to a Foul Mood:** Speaker E shares a personal anecdote about being sick and feeling he had a "right" to be in a foul mood. He identifies this as a "victim mentality"—a fabricated story the mind clings to in order to justify and perpetuate dissatisfaction.

**In summary,** the talk uses a blend of classic Buddhist imagery (the two arrows) and modern, relatable analogies (Teflon, ham sandwiches, stepping around shit) to convey core teachings: ending self-judgment, abandoning the victim mindset, proactively cultivating satisfaction, and developing a resilient mind that lets go of unwholesome states.
