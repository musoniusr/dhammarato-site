### Transcript


**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] So Michael, we have been talking about Buddhist teaching the Dharma to high school kids in a kind of philosophical way, and also in a philosophical way there's that question of, is there free will or not? Okay, and the first thing that I would have to say is that free will is not like, let us say, a white sheet that has the sun shining on it, and then some object comes really close to it to cause an absolute definite shadow, so that there is a very clear distinction between what's black or what is in the shadow and what is out of the shadow. But if you move the shadow back just a little, you'll begin to see that there is what are called a penumbrum that actually happens in a solar eclipse, that even though the narrow band of a full eclipse is only 90 miles wide, a partial eclipse goes out about 150 to 200 miles. OK, in other words, what we're talking about is the boundary between free will and no free will is a fuzzy boundary. And if we can understand that it's a fuzzy boundary, that it's not just black and white, but in fact there's 50 shades of gray in there also. So, from that, we can look at it in the sense of the teaching of the Buddha, and we can pinpoint the point exactly down to right noble effort. An item on the Eightfold Noble Path, because anything that you have to put effort into and anything you have to work at is some sort of expense. Right now, in the beginning, when people are ignorant, literally because they're ignorant, they pick up ignorant, stupid, dangerous, harmful things. A guy who doesn't know what a snake is or thinks it's about will pick it up and have problems with it. So in that regard, everything starts in ignorance, and when that happens, we wind up with a destiny because we keep doing the same thing over and over again, because we don't wake up to the fact that there's other pathways to go down, that we think that our life is nothing but this one-way highway. And all we have to do is to put in the time, but that's kind of a drudgery, and we don't recognize that there's all kinds of scenery on the side, as well as parks and playgrounds, or maybe there's a fork in the road and we can take the road not taken. So, this is the whole point of it, and that the idea of that you have no free will, you have none, means that instead, that your life is controlled by some destiny. Now, in magical thinking, we think that the destiny is controlled from the outside, just like the magical thinking is everything happens on the outside and it happens to me. But within the wise way of looking at it, everything that's on the outside is not even interested in me. It's just out there. And that everything that really happens is my experience that I create on the inside. That's a different perspective, and that's the one that's doing it with wisdom or with insight. Because the other way of doing it, through ignorance, is the way that we're taught. Humans in general are fairly ignorant. That's why we still have wars, is because of the ignorance. And so I might take a moment to digress on that, in the sense that There's two kinds of Buddhisms, and even two kinds of Suttas, in the sense that there is the ordinary that's taught to children. We give them a set of rules or precepts, or commandments, or laws, that in fact in the first grade we begin to teach the kids a whole lot of rules and laws and things. But basically, they go back down to the Ten Commandments on one side, or the Sharia on another, or the Five Precepts or Ten Precepts of the Buddhist, in the sense that the real teaching should be that if you lie, you're not going to be free from that lie until you stop telling that lie. And that's a really good way of looking at it, that that's actually the Kamma that's long-lasting, is that we have to put a stop to the behavior because every cause has an effect. And the Law of Kamma is much more related to what's happening right now rather than a buildup of storage. It's almost like that there's a great big silo up there and you dump all your garbage into it. But that's going to be your home when you get up there. That's the kind of idea that people have about it. But the reality is that every rotten cabbage we throw in the air always lands upon our own head. And it does so only as long as gravity takes to get it back down. Then our results of our bad behavior is soon enough. It's not way out there. Now, the point is that the way-outness there determines it in the sense of a destiny, rather than the present moment, it being an event. And so the destiny or the plan that we make is simply going down the same road over and over and over again, and not getting new results, err how bad we want new results. So, if people get stuck in a way of thinking, then the thoughts that they have will be the feelings they have, which will then be the words that they speak, which will then be the actions that they take. And the actions they take will create the habits of doing those actions one after another, and then the habits become the destiny. Now, an easy and clear example of that is the statement, he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. All right, now how can that possibly be true? Let's say that this guy is championship all of Japan at whatever time. He is absolutely the best there is. But if he keeps wielding that sword and harming people his whole life, after he gets 60, 70, or 80 years old, somebody's going to sneak up behind him and he's going to lose it. In the sense that somebody now is a little bit faster and they're going to get him. If he don't put that sword down and retire from swordsmanship, somebody's going to kill him with a sword. That— that— see how obvious that's going to be? He's eventually going to lose that fight.

**Speaker B:** Or he's going to turn it on himself.

**Speaker A:** That happens too, don't it? Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I just have so many thoughts on this topic that I'm like forgetting even where to start, but I guess I've just been sort of looking at the way people talk about this topic in in the Buddhist community and then also in like the non-duality community. And it seems like it's becoming more and more prevalent that people are falling on the side of that there is no such thing as free will, there is no such thing as choice. And even when, except for, except for like good Buddhist teachers, especially monastics that I hear give teachings on this, but To me, like, you know, it's like even in like the non-dual community, they'll do the neti-neti process to disidentify with the five aggregates, essentially, as we call it. But even when they're sort of resting in awareness or they collapse the duality between awareness and its objects, there's still this idea that that it's part of a causal process that there isn't control of. But, you know, the one thing that makes me question this constantly is in the Udana, where the Buddha, you know, he mentions that amongst there is the unborn, the unbecome, the unmade, the unconditioned. If there wasn't the unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, you could not know escape here from the born, become, made, and conditioned. But because there is an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned, Therefore, you do know an escape from the born, become made, and conditioned. So for me, in this topic, that's.

**Speaker A:** Where this topic is. This conversation that we're having right now is going exactly in that direction, just not using that language, but I'll incorporate it.

**Speaker B:** So my feeling on that is that like the Buddhist teaching is wholly about the ability to make a fresh choice. It's just on a spectrum from how enslaved you are by ignorance and craving, or how liberated you are in knowledge and vision of the way things are. It's either ignorance and craving that's controlling your life, or it's knowledge and vision of the way things are that gives you the ability to make a fresh choice. And when people speak of the lack of free will, they're still only looking at the world of conditions, the world of causality, and they're not recognizing the freedom that comes with the recognition of the unconditioned or the realization.

**Speaker A:** You can say all of that really easily, and that is just that, okay, here's a very easy way to say it. The guy goes into the doctor's office and says, you know, when I scratch my arm, my armpit gets really sore. The doctor looks at him and he says, if you stop scratching your armpit Will it get better? And the guy thinks, yeah, it probably will. And the doctor says, well, stop scratching your armpit.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I like your way of putting it.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what that means exactly is the unconditioned is the removal of the conditioning that the rash was having under the arm Because of the conditioning of the scratching. So when you stop the scratching, the arm will heal. And so the unconditioned— okay, the rash is unborn now.

**Speaker B:** I see. Okay, I've been spending so much time thinking about what the heck the unborn is, but that makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's not— it's the only sense to make out of it. It's just this highfalutin strange language that the Pali is, is different than the language that we speak. And the translators don't have a clue about what's going on. So naturally they're going to fall back to whatever definition they find in some other translation. Basically.

**Speaker B:** I have another quote that I think shows where it goes wrong and where the distinction is. Even though I love— I don't know if you've ever heard of the Zen master Bhante they call his Dharma lazy Dharma. He was like the less popular contemporary of like Dogen and Rinzai and stuff like that. And he was all about like, you don't have to do anything, you just have to rest in the unborn awareness.

**Speaker A:** They all teach that, but they want to do it in a high-polluting way. They don't like it when he gets down and dirty and simple. But the Buddhist teaching is really down and clean and simple. It is, but I wanted to— it's always— I wanted to just stop doing everything and that's it, and then it.

**Speaker B:** Becomes unconditioned on its own because all.

**Speaker A:** The conditioning was what you were doing. You were creating the conditioning.

**Speaker B:** If you kind of— if you listen to Bhante's quote on the unborn, it's more similar, I think, to the way that modern non-dualists think about it and why that they think there's no free will. Like, this is This is what he says. He says, an enlightened awareness is within each one of us right at this moment. This enlightened awareness is truly unborn and marvelously illuminating, and everything is perfectly managed by it. Conclusively realize that what is unborn and illuminating is truly awakened and without effort, rests naturally as the unborn mind. Resting in this way, you are a living Buddha. It's that everything is perfectly managed by it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's the point.

**Speaker B:** I agree with all of that.

**Speaker A:** Well, when you are in sensory awareness, when you are just sitting and receiving, then that unborn, unconditioned state is there. That— and I call that paradise, okay? Because we're just in the paradise, not judging it. When we start judging it, we condition it. When the thoughts start up, that's the conditioning. Things get started. That's what puts a stop to it. So everything about that is quite beautiful. It's just in such spectacularly over-the-top language.

**Speaker B:** I think it's simple, but I also think that the part where he says, "And everything is managed by it," is true, but also can be misleading.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, all right. In that event, everything is subject to cause and effect, is all that statement is making. Everything is managed by everything else.

**Speaker B:** So in that sense, then the unconditioned is not outside of causality?

**Speaker A:** It's not outside of causality. It's coming to a rest. And don't let inputs affect you. It's like the dominoes. You see those dominoes and they all fall around, and you've seen various ways of doing that. Okay, you've got a domino sitting here and he comes and, you know, I ain't falling over, and he puts a stop to the whole show. Okay, well, he just made the choice. I'm not falling over. That's the choice he made. All the other dominoes, they had no choice. They just fell over because they'd been falling over. They're due to gravity. They're not due to their own strong will. Of standing up to it and not falling over.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the point I'm making, is that for there to be the possibility of choice, then there has to be some element in our experience that is able to escape causality. And I think that's what the Buddha is talking about when he talks about the unconditioned.

**Speaker A:** And the way to say that is get over it, forget about it. Don't let it continue to condition you. Don't bring it up. Don't think about it. And then you're not conditioned by it. So when you, when you take away the cause, then you take away the effect. Or we can manage the effect in a different way, because in fact the word— it's better to not even use the word cause and causality because that word actually has the connotation of one thing does the cause. A better word to use is conditionality, because in some things, things are conditioned in new ways. An example of the domino is that in one way it's unconditioned, it has no foundation, it's got no floor, it's an easy pushover. But the domino that's standing up, he just happened to have had some super glue And so he superglued himself to the floor. So when that next domino falls on him, he ain't going anywhere.

**Speaker B:** And that element, like if you listen to these conversations, it seems that that doesn't seem to be present even in like the non-dual community where they're saying like awareness itself is— I really am.

**Speaker A:** Unconditioned by the non-dual community. Sorry about that. I have no interest in what any of them have to say.

**Speaker B:** I'm getting there too. My theory, just to put it out there, is that that's a crazy perspective because they talk a lot about consciousness or awareness or knowing. They use those three different words sort of synonymously. I think that choice or agency is the main primary quality of consciousness besides knowing. It's— I think it's the element that not only knows but also that is also capable of directing the world.

**Speaker A:** One would say responsibility, the ability to respond to stimulus. Okay, that state of unconditioned is something that a human can practice But almost always we go around being conditioned blob, conditioned in hundreds of different ways, and it takes a while to bring that conditioning off. You could say then the conditioning, each one's individual whole realm of conditioning, is one's destiny. And because of that conditioning, they have no choice. There is no freedom of doing things, or having the ability to respond in a wise way. Rather, they respond not in a response, but in a reaction. They don't respond, they react, because they're doing the same thing that they were trained to do. Them dominoes got to fall, they always have. Well, not if we superglue one of them to the floor, right? And so the question is, can we begin to superglue ourselves down so that we can stop wiggling so much? Well, this is what the Anapanasati and the breathing is all about. This is the whole idea of the monkey mind. Can you, uh, superglue that monkey? Uh-huh. Okay, can you in fact keep making it a smaller and smaller place for him to stay? You put him first in a pasture, then in the corral, then in a stall, and by the time you got him in the stall, you get your hands on him easy enough. Okay, the mind is the same way. So long as it's got wide variety to roam, it's going to wind up in the in the briars, in the thickets, in the canyon he can't get out of, and all kinds of dangers that are out there. But that's the horse's destiny, is to roam, fall down, and get hurt and die, because he's too stupid to recognize it is much better in the pasture. But once we can get the horse into the pasture, he'll begin to like it. Okay, what is the pasture for the meditation? Is the wholesome thought. We got to get the mind into the wholesome thought rather than letting it run all over the place. So in this regard, we can say that the monkey mind is going to roam, but we're only going to let it roam in one tree. We're going to remove it or put it into a tree where there's no other trees around to jump to. So he can jump all over the place in this tree, but this tree is the only one he can jump into. He can't jump into those unwholesome trees. And so we're beginning to corral the mind, which is like finally buying that tube of super glue. We're getting around to it, okay? We're going to glue that thing down, but we got to do it in a process, in stages, okay? So when we're doing it like this, we're actually putting in the effort that it takes to bring the mental horse out of the wild into the pasture. Once the horse gets into the pasture, he really likes it. But getting him in there took a lot of work, a lot of effort, a lot of chasing around to get that horse into that pasture. Once he's there, he don't want to leave. So the mind is like that. We have to keep training it and training it over and over again. And this takes work, it takes effort, over and over and over again. It takes an effort to start throwing the conditions out one at a time, to throw. And so the boundary of the fence of the pasture is a way of throwing the unwholesome out, or throwing some conditions, some conditioning out. This is why it's such a good reason to use the word to stop whatever the conditioning is, it's harmful. Stop. Let's put a stop to it. Maybe not every time, but right now we can stop. We can stop it right now. We can actually take that condition away, and maybe for a split second then we'll be unconditioned until some new condition comes up. Like, every thought's a new kind of condition. And so we're looking for the goal of becoming unconditioned. Which means we throw out all the rules and just sort of learn to hang out and to stop conditioning ourselves by wanting stuff.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** I think so.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking about what you said about not caring about that non-dual community, and I was like, okay, I think the reason why I let myself care about this so much is because, for one, I perceive it as such a misunderstanding of the Dhamma that offends me. And the other thing is, it makes people so unbelievably passive in their life, and I see harm in millions of people pursuing the Dharma just to take away their own agency and become extremely passive, when I think it's a lot more about claiming that agency and cultivating that pasture that you're talking about. By realizing where the freedom actually is in that element of knowing. Do you know who the scientist Donald Hoffman is? One of the most interesting guys around right now. He created this theory that he calls the Interface Theory of Perception, and I won't explain it. Like, in brief, he says that space-time, like the actual scientific theory of space-time, like space-time and physical objects don't actually exist except as a perceptual construct. He compares it to the interface on a computer where the desktop is space and time and the icons are physical objects. And he's created a mathematical proof that consciousness itself, rather than matter, is what the universe is actually made of. It's it's the only element in the universe. But he calls these conscious agents, like, you know, just an infinitude pluralization of one substance that he calls them conscious agents because they can interact and construct.

**Speaker A:** But you know something, the word agent is important there. I think I would rather have him doing that kind of research and sitting down and thinking through things like that rather than jumping into the tank as a tank commander and going off to war. It's a whole lot better.

**Speaker B:** You should look him up. I think you'd like him. He meditates.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yes, but he also cogitates a lot too. Yeah, he's asking questions that don't need answers. He's philosophizing. He's trying to think himself out of a paper bag.

**Speaker B:** Well, he's using mathematics to prove his theories. I know.

**Speaker A:** How sick can someone get? I mean, look at all the years he spent figuring all that out with his math when he could have been happy sitting around doing nothing anyway.

**Speaker B:** Well, the reason I bring it up.

**Speaker A:** Is because— and that brings me back to the point that you were making about the people who are passive, and you don't like that. You want them to do what? Would they just sit passively and do much of nothing? I mean, we've got, what, 400,000 monks here in Thailand, and that's basically— they're just happy sitting around doing nothing. And if they're not happy, that means they're out doing something.

**Speaker B:** Well, they're, they're, they're not doing nothing. They're actively reconditioning or deconditioning or unconditioning, if you want to say, that their.

**Speaker A:** Mind which is a whole bunch of nothing.

**Speaker B:** That's one way of thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, think about it that way. Stop thinking, in fact, at all, because that's just the conditioning. There's no reason to think about it all that much. It's just recognizing that we don't have to be so conditioned, that we can uncondition, that we can practice stop doing that conditioning. And then practice again. Oh, I see that argument that I had with Aunt Susie. There's no reason to think about it right now. It's conditioning me. It's a hindrance. The Buddha talked about it in that regard. They call it a hindrance or an obstruction to going where we want to go, or it's a conditioning that keeps us from being in an unconditioned state. So now that I'm thinking about that argument with Aunt Susie, what can I do? I can wake up and see, oh, this whole porch is empty of Susie. There's no Susies here, there's no Susiness here. The only Susiness that's here is in here. That's the only place, and it's unhappy and uncomfortable in there. Let it go. And I can sit here unconditioned by Susie and the argument with Susie, because really the conditioning was something that I invented. It was not real. There was no real conditioning. It was all there. Okay. So in fact, some of the stuff that you said about the guy, he's taking it too far. But the reality is, let us say, we don't really care whether reality itself is part of a matrix, part of a computer, or how big the computer is, or whether the reality is the computer itself. That's a better way of looking at it, is that reality is a kind of computer. And it is really smart about every, every molecule operate the same. Okay, so with that, humans do not live in that reality. Humans live in a mentally constructed reality, and this is how it goes, is that we can't just take data as input. We take it and massage it and moralize it and make rules about it and can reconfigure it, bring a feeling or two into it. And then that becomes the output of our perception, what the Buddha called the salyatana. And we're confused that what we thought about that that was out there was what was out there. And it's not. We're dreaming, even though out there is out there. Instead of getting a whole lot more of out there, let's just take a little bit of out there and dream up a story about it. It. And that's what humans do. Now, one of the ways of looking at this is that the more input we take, the closer to reality we are. And the less input we take, the less close to reality we are. And we are taught as children to do what we're told to do, which means to limit our ability to take in input. You've got to stay on that road; you can't go traveling all over the the countryside and figure out what's going on. It's a big, wide reality out there, but you got to stay on this road. And that road then becomes the reality, and that road is actually in someone's mind. So ignorance means that we limit our ability to perceive— not perceive, to be conscious of reality. That perception is the word we use which means that we cloud it and modify it and fit it into our little brains. Okay, or another way of talking about it is like this, that consciousness is like seeing. And I'll make a little mistake here, but to make the point, and I say, I see a tree. That's different than saying, I see what you mean. Now, "I see what you mean" means that we've communicated with words enough to construct concepts, and now we're matching mental concepts. But when I say "the tree," believe me, the image that you made up of a tree is not the tree I'm looking at. It's not. The joke is that I'm looking at a fan palm that are quite rare.

**Speaker B:** Or imagine a tree that a chameleon sees with their independently moving eyes and their total different perceptual system.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. Or another way of doing it in the sense with that is that, yeah, the tree is all around us and we're in the tree, but we don't. We get images of it from a distance of the tree. And this is what I mean, is that we live in a reality that's based upon perception, that is based upon the past, and that it's quite a skill to develop to be able to see when we're doing that and often put a stop to it and come back to reality as itself without conditioning it. Okay, the conditioning is the perception and we condition. It's almost like being served dinner at a restaurant and the first thing we do is pour salt on it. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** The Pali word papancha, Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it as conceptual proliferation, but Thanha Sarabikkhu translates it as objectification. And both make sense, but objectification is more accurate in my opinion because it points to the fact that the mind is actually what constructs the objects in the world, you know, whether it be a physical object or a conceptual object, it's objectifying the raw data. And, you know, and the most famous sutta where that word is explored is the Honeyball Sutta.

**Speaker A:** I was about to mention Sutta 18. Yes, this is exactly the sutta that we're talking about. The mental proliferations that besiege a man. We think and we think. That's that mental proliferation, rather than just staying at the input. So you can say that the mental proliferations are the conditioning, and what we're pouring on is a syrup that comes out of the sewer of the past, right? Sweeten it, and it don't taste all that good. We're trying to understand things. We don't like what we come up with.

**Speaker B:** I think I'm addicted to trying to make metaphysical conclusions when that's not really what it's about, you know.

**Speaker A:** It's about how do you feel about your cotton-picking conclusions about metaphysics. Metaphysics, in fact, that's the problem, is metaphysics is irrelevant, just like the streetcars in San Francisco. Why? Because people can ride on that streetcar happily and other people ride that streetcar miserably, and then they both get off and now there's no streetcar. And the guy who was happily getting off the streetcar and is not on the streetcar is not there the way that the guy who got off the streetcar miserably. He's still miserable and he thinks it's important. OK, so here's the point that a lot of that metaphysical stuff is irrelevant until it becomes valuable. Now, metaphysics can also be understood as magical thinking, because physics is physics, and meta means way too much of it rather than the reality of the situation. All right, so, um, or the supernatural— it's not just natural enough, it's the supernatural. Okay. And so metaphysical, supernatural— another word would be magical, magical thing. All right. Where we're more concerned about things that don't exist or are so far away that it doesn't matter whether they exist or not, rather than being interested in the things that are happening right here, right now. So that happens with people believing in rebirth. And they really, really want rebirth. The point is, is that rebirth, whatever it is, nobody knows it. It's too far away. It's beyond the veil of death. And even who people are dead, they don't know whether they're being reborn or not. It's all based in ignorance. We don't know. And instead of saying we don't know, but what we do know is I can be happy when I don't know. That's the issue. Now, that's not an easy place to come to, because metaphysics, magic, supernatural, all of that stuff is so inviting that most of the people of the world are into it. Only in very recent times are people making the substitution for magic by going into media. So media is the new magic, because most of it is not real. Almost none of it is real, in fact. But that's where the kids are. Instead of reading an old newspaper with all the tragedy, now they're reading it on their iPhone. All the tragedy, all the problems of the world. Okay. And it's all, let us say, very dangerous to stay out of reality, into all of that perceived stuff that people are making up. We don't have to perceive anything. This is back to the point about if we would stop conditioning ourselves with magical thoughts, metaphysics, super magic, supernatural, all of that kind of input that comes from all of the perceptions of all of those people, and just sit here and look at nature, you're pretty well unconditioned.

**Speaker B:** Just stay with experience.

**Speaker A:** Just stay with this moment's experience, not grabbing a hold of a great big one that we like and then hanging on to that. But that's what people normally do with experiences, not that this is it. They have the 'I had one,' that 'I want one.' That's what experience is all about. And the real experience, the real way of looking at experience, is just what we're doing right now. We're experiencing the present moment. It's a verb, not a noun.

**Speaker B:** I think I just had like a, like a mild realization because I was first, I was thinking like, because when I have these conversations with you, all of a sudden, boom, here we are in the present moment and all that stuff that I've been obsessing over doesn't matter. And I'm like, okay, why did I forget this again? But when I, my insight My insight, hopefully I remember this, is, I mean, I will, but hopefully it has the same impact, is, okay, here's why people like me are obsessed with philosophy, metaphysics, whatever you want to call it.

**Speaker A:** It is that you're looking for a way out. That's right.

**Speaker B:** It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a Samsara that isn't, doesn't smell, or, you know, it's not like a physical Samsara, it's a mental Samsara. So it feels remote from, you know, those heavenly messengers of aging, illness, and death. Even though it does experience it, it feels like it's in some pure realm because it's all mental, but it's a cycle of birth and death. Here's a concept that I'm obsessed over right now, then here's a new concept, then a new concept, then a new concept, and then every time you become bored with one, you make a new one, and then you make a new one, and then you make a new one, and you miss the aging, illness, and death of it.

**Speaker A:** Right, and here's the point: everyone is doing that, even some people are doing it with metaphysics, some are doing it with rebirth, some are doing it with magic, some are doing it with super-being, supernatural and that kind of stuff, some of them are doing it with politics, some of them are doing it with sales. Whatever it is that we get obsessed about, whatever concept that we get obsessed about, that's what we do. And in fact, that's how we make it a profession. A clear example is people who go to a psychologist, especially as children, wind up two things. Number one is they fail at getting cured in psychology, but they get so into it that there is only one possible profession for them to ever go into, and that is becoming a therapist, a psychotherapist. And that happens over and over and over again. They got really good statistics all over Europe that the kids who go to psychotherapists in their childhood wind up becoming psychotherapists in their adulthood. Yeah, so this is, this is that whole thing we become obsessed over something or another. I was obsessed over computers at one time, but before that I was obsessed with electronics, but before that I was obsessed with music. I've been obsessed with a whole bunch of stuff in my life. I even got obsessed with the sex, and then I got obsessed with psychotherapy and that kind of stuff. So man, I have really been obsessed with the Dhamma, except that the Dhamma has taught me, hey man, if you're going to be so obsessed, at least enjoy doing it. But most obsessed people are not having fun at it because they're not doing it in the here and now, they're doing it in the sense of concepts.

**Speaker B:** So this is what makes the Buddhist teaching so unique, is that there isn't a right view, there's only a right viewing, as you say, because any view is just another mental construct.

**Speaker A:** It's just another mental concept.

**Speaker B:** Born, ages, gets ill, and dies, and.

**Speaker A:** Was conditioned by other concepts.

**Speaker B:** So you can't come— you can't come to like an absolutely true concept because that's just a mental birth that's going to decay.

**Speaker A:** It's going to decay and die. Can you enjoy the process knowing that your mental baby grew up, matured into an idea, or perhaps even into a product? Only to have it die. A clear example of that is the automobile. The ICE, the Ford, the General Motors kind of cars that they made in the 1930s, those great big companies are about to die right now. Why? Because they're obsessed with that kind of engine, they're obsessed with that motor, they're obsessed with the way that they build the cars. Here's another example. Oh, and by the way, I need to finish the point, is that the electric cars are now going to eat their lunch. They're in demand, they're cheaper, they're better, they're better built, they don't fall apart like gas cars. That for every— gosh, in a gas-powered car, the engine and the things concerned with that engine, the number of parts is in the literally tens of thousands. With an electric motor, we're talking about under 100 parts. Under 100 parts. Now, when we talk about that, we're talking about maybe 30 or 40 parts in the battery, but all of that stuff was put together so that we have a whole bunch of batteries, but they're all the same. And then we have, yeah, but the electric motor's got a lot of windings in it. Yeah, but the winding is only one wire. All you had to do is wind it on that contraption, and now you've got a motor out of it. And so that's the whole point. And yet the ICE industry is absolutely refusing to recognize that the electric car systems, like out of China and out of Tesla, are going to put those big companies out of business. Why? Because they're obsessed with the way that they do things. Here's another example. James Watt manufactured, designed, and built the steam engine specifically to solve the problem of pumping water out of a coal mine, because coal mines got flooded. But in that coal mine, they've got two things: they've got coal and they've got water, which is exactly the two things that a steam engine needs. And so they started pumping water with a steam engine out of the coal mines, and this was like 1620. By 1720, they had done not much of anything. Basically, that was the generation that started the Industrial Revolution. It took them 100 years now to take that steam engine out of the coal mine and put it in the back door of the factory and bring the coal and the water to the factory. And then you could use that one steam engine with all these belts and pulleys and all that kind of stuff, manufacture. And that was the birth of the Industrial Revolution, was by putting the Watt steam engine to work. Before that, all they got out of that steam engine was coal. Now they've got cotton shirts and pants, all kinds of stuff coming out of that steam engine. But it took another 100 years until the 1320s for them to take that steam engine and put it on rails, to have a locomotive. Now, why did it take literally 200 years from the time of that coal mine to get that steam engine on rails, to put it where it could go someplace? Why? Because the engineers and the scientists and whatever were obsessed with improving what they had. And they couldn't recognize it. So this is a very clear example of it, but I've got a lot of them because I've got an engineering background. Did it really take that long? There was a guy who invented a computer in the 1820s, Babbage. We all know it when we study computer science. The one problem with it is they didn't have the technology of the day. To actually manufacture the machine that he put on paper. But it was broken down and everything. Well, in the last 100 years or so, they've actually been able to build Babbage computers, and they're fantastic. They're much better than a calculator and do all kinds of things. But it looks like 10,000 clocks have been glued together. That's what it looks like, because everything is done on sprockets and wheels and whatnot like that. The wheels go around so that you can have the number 10, and then when it goes around to the next one, then it clicks the one beside it so that you can actually add numbers on this thing really fast. Really excellent like that. Invented in the 1820s, and nobody was able to use it at all. Okay, so this is the point that I'm making, is that concepts don't always work in our favor. And yet humans, we live in a conceptualized world. You cannot drive a car that was not conceived. And not only that, but a whole lot of people had to have a whole lot of concepts in order to actually produce that car.

**Speaker B:** The car is a mental construct, not in terms just only of perception, but actually.

**Speaker A:** But in reality, it was nothing and never was. I mean, it was the manifestation of Concepts and people willing to put in the effort to get it. The car wasn't free, okay? And so let's go back now to the point about free will, okay? This is that for most people, they have no actual will. They have habits, and they instinctively respond to habits. Like reaction. So they acted one time when they were a kid, the next time they acted the same way, and as they've grown into adult, they just keep doing the same thing over again, reacting to what environment that they have. And they're reacting based upon a set of standards or concepts that they built as a child. It wasn't that they were ignorant, is that they were partially ignorant. You see, no child has the ability to figure things out the way that a master mathematician or engineer would be able to figure things out, that a child actually is ordered to take in and believe what he's told to believe. We're not supposed to think, figure things out for ourselves. When kids do, they get into a whole lot of trouble at school. You're supposed to do what you're told to do. And so we get into that mentality, and that's what in fact develops into a destiny. We're told to do it, we do it ignorantly, we keep doing it over and over again, and we get into the habit of doing it that way. That becomes our destiny. And if you're just— if your habits include a sword then you'll probably die by that sword, because that's your destiny to die by it, because the sword's in your habit system. So whatever is in your habit system is probably going to be what does you in eventually, or maybe even right now. We keep getting dug in, that's why— done in, that's why we feel bad. So the idea then that we don't really have any will at all, there is only destiny for most people. And that's what philosophy and religions and all that kind of stuff— we've got a huge number of words for it: Providence, God's plan, the will of God, you know, destiny. Okay, all of that kind of stuff is because over many, many, many centuries, the wise people could see that the fools are stuck. We're stuck in a rut. And that rut is easy to see. Your dad went down that rut, and there you go, and I see exactly where you're headed. That's been easy to see for those who would look. And there's been people who looked all along, but the mass number of people go by that habit. They have the destiny. So, along now comes the teaching of the Buddha, and people are then beginning to learn that a lot of the effort that they were putting into following their destiny, they can start now putting some effort into changing that destiny. Now, we can't change the destiny, really. We can't even change the habits, really. We can't even change our actions yet. But what we can change is this thought, the one that we're having right now. Not the way we think, just this thought. And that's the one that needs to be changed. And it's fairly easy to change if we recognize, hey, I can change my thought right now. And so, if I say something and you feel bad about it, there's a kind of an instant— remember we were talking about the snakes and that instant reaction? OK, so I can say something or even have it in a tone of voice that may be familiar to you, and you'll have the same reaction instantly that you had before. This is what we call Triggers. NLP is really big on these kind of things, is to recognize that we can get triggered really, really fast. Okay. And that often people are triggered really fast into arguing. And how that gets started is mom comes into the bedroom and says, well, what about this? And the kid goes, yeah, mom, but blah, blah, blah, blah. And the kids start arguing with mom. And then every time we're confronted with our bad behavior we immediately defend ourselves, start arguing, saying that we can't be heard, nobody's listening, no respect, can't get no respect. And this is how we feel, when in fact the original guy who pushed your button didn't even know that he was pushing your button. Or maybe he was arguing too and was intending to push your button, and here you are going each other, pushing each other's buttons. And this is where full arguments come in. Because nobody is watching what's going on. But when we start to watch and start to see, we begin to have choices. We have no choices in ignorance. If we're ignorant of something, we've got no choice. But once we can see it, once we become wise to it, we've got huge choice. And in this regard, the Buddha recommends change unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. That's very easy to do. And then you'll have another unwholesome thought. Never mind, have a wholesome thought now. And recognizing that it's okay to have unwholesome thoughts because it's okay to see whatever thoughts there are. But a lot of people say, oh no, I don't have unwholesome thoughts, and they're having one right then. They're being defensive right then, okay? And so, uh, this is why it's kind of subtle. It's difficult. It's especially difficult to teach the Dharma to people who want to argue with every point that you make. We get kind of nowhere until we address the argumentation and to have the student recognize that, look, you're arguing again. Look, you don't hear what I'm saying, and all I did was repeat what you said, and you still want to argue with me.

**Speaker B:** That also goes back to the Honeyball Sutta.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, it's this mental proliferation of these old feelings. So as we begin to change from the unwholesome thought into the wholesome thought over and over again, we begin to pay the price of reality. We actually have to pay the price of pleasure, that we roll down the hill and it takes some effort to roll back up the hill. So that we can enjoy the view again. And over and over we put in the effort. There is actually a price to pay to gain control of one's own mind so that you can have a will. Because when we use the word will, there's various different definitions, including what somebody signs before they die so that people won't fight. Okay, that's one kind of will. And another kind of will is, I think, is the kind that we have, like, at least now I have the will to live, or that I want something. So a lot of will has to do with want.

**Speaker B:** That's fake free will.

**Speaker A:** That's not— that's not free will. But people would say that all free will— so here's an example of that. In the sense of freedom, that the kid wants to go drive to the town, he wants to borrow the car, he's a teenager, he wants to borrow the car so he can have the freedom to go around and to play with his friends. And Dad says no, you can't have the car keys, you don't have the freedom to go around. Now if the kid is wise he would have then the point of having freedom from wanting to go around.

**Speaker B:** This is the American idea of freedom versus the Buddhist idea of freedom.

**Speaker A:** Exactly right.

**Speaker B:** Americans want the freedom to do it, but the impetus is coming from craving, so there's no real freedom unless you get rid of craving.

**Speaker A:** That's good.

**Speaker B:** Our choices are rooted in craving, but our craving is rooted in ignorance. That's what dependent origination illustrates.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly, exactly. So in that regard, then, that real freedom comes in wisdom, comes in knowledge, comes in the freedom from— the freedom from— okay, you don't want to— from.

**Speaker B:** Craving, the freedom from ignorance.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and so in that regard, there lies the will, which then would be equated with the Buddha's word of Samma Sanghappa, which is part of the Eightfold Noble Path. The result of correct effort is an attitude, an attitude of can-do attitude, an attitude of I know that I can practice no matter how obstructed my mind gets, I can throw that stuff out. And Buddha says that one point, no matter how obstructed my mind gets, I can throw that out and see reality as it is. I can stop the conditioning, I can throw the junk out, and I can see reality as it is. The Buddha says that this state, this one point, is the first step on the path. This is the beginning of the Srotapanna. And the Buddha further says that this point of the knowledge that I can clean out my mind is noble, it is lokottara or supermundane, it is in fact a factor of the path, and it's not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people don't ever get to that "I've got the will." They maybe have the will to live, but they don't have the will to control their own mind. I know that I can get my mind out of the filth. I can clean my mind. I know I can do that. Now that's real will.

**Speaker B:** So essentially, free will sort of actually doesn't start until you gain stream entry. So it's like a Srotapanna has a little bit of free will, Sakadagami has a little more, and Anagami has a little more, and then Arahant is completely free.

**Speaker A:** Free enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** This completely free is just a concept. Go for free enough.

**Speaker B:** Well, when there's no craving or delusion— That's free enough. Then consciousness is completely free. I mean, that's the whole point of the path. And if consciousness has agency, it's inherently consciousness.

**Speaker A:** We're free enough. To not have to use the word completely. Completely is an adjective or an adverb that tries to describe how good it is, when in fact really the only point is it's good enough.

**Speaker B:** Well, completely, at least in the suttas, refers to the fact that craving is never going to arise again. Ignorance is never going to come back.

**Speaker A:** I know, and that is so idealistic.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm not saying everybody has it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's kind of over the top. You could say that in fact that only someone who is in bed sick in old age would be the kind of person who didn't want anything. He doesn't even want to go to the bathroom, he just craps.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I would make a distinction between— I'd make a distinction between like ignorant wanting and like, you know, wise wanting.

**Speaker A:** Or you can say— all right, now.

**Speaker B:** We'Re getting someplace— the inclination of wisdom.

**Speaker A:** Sutta number 131 is now making this point. I'm glad that you brought it up that way. One portion of detachment is often how it's translated, all right? Because, um, which was— which is basically, um, the point about being in the present moment, that being in the present moment is something that's worthy of attachment. There are a few things that are worthy of attachment. So Nibbana— not attachment, but not the concept— not the concept, but being— yeah, man, hang on, I'll, I'll be there in a minute. I'm having too much fun just chilling, you know. That way we can see it, yes, that the things that we want to attach to are the wholesome and noble things, as opposed to attaching to the unwholesome, ignoble things, that we attach ignorant. That if we attached wisely, then we wouldn't have the greed and ill-will attachment to it, we would be in those places that were free from greed and and ill will. So let's finish up with the punchline to the joke that we've been telling for the past hour, okay? And that, and that is that will is not divided between free will exists or not exists. Remember I talked about that there was a gray area between Okay, so here's the punchline to the joke, and that is: will is not free. You gotta work at it. It's expensive. Free will is not free. It's expensive will. But the point is, are you willing to pay the price?

**Speaker B:** It's very true.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's it, that people misunderstand. They think that I'm either free to go sin and free to harm people, or I'm not free because of my destiny? Well, maybe your destiny is for you to go harm people. That's a habit you built up. Yeah, okay. That a pirate has a destiny just like a king. They're both stuck in a rut.

**Speaker B:** Can I, can I share one last little text? Um, I've been wanting to share this with you, um, because I think one, it proves your point that you only need first Jhana for the practice. The Buddha says it, you know. And two, I think— all the proof.

**Speaker A:** I need, but go ahead.

**Speaker B:** And two, I think it also, it also, if you look at it carefully in the context of this conversation, it's illustrating the— that going from that realm of, we'll say, classical and operant conditioning, to use Piaget's language, to being unconditioned is the direct path to freedom that you talk about. It's just one part of Majjhima Nikaya 64. So I'll just read it. I think it kind of proves those two points. But the Buddha says, in what Ananda is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters, here with seclusion from acquisitions, with the abandoning of unwholesome states, 'With the complete tranquilization of bodily inertia, quite secluded from sensual pleasure, secluded from unwholesome states, a Bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first Jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.' The traditional illustration of the first Jhana. But this is the main part here. He says Whatever exists there— so you're in the first jhana— whatever exists therein of material form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, he sees those states as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumor, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not-self. He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless element. Thus, this is the peaceful, this is the sublime, that is the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving. Dispassion, cessation, Nibbana. If he is steady in that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dharma, then with the destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one due to— he basically becomes the Anagami. Um, but yeah, he's, he's saying that in the first Jhana, if you would, if you attend to the deathless or the unconditioned, then you could be liberated right there. And then he goes through all the rest of the jhanas, but it's the same story for each jhana.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's an important point that I think that in fact most of the Westerners miss when we hear that word deathless. Because— how you use the word, that's a very interesting word— because look at that word. You use that word often in, let us say, honor of cause and effect, because of that. So, um, so getting into that state of unbecoming or deathless is only because whatever that would have died, like my mental argument with Aunt Susie didn't have to die because it wasn't born and never thought about Aunt Susie. All right, birth is the cause. Yeah, the birth of that thought is the cause of its death. And my— and the actual, uh, event of its death was when it was killed off to become back unconditioned again. Okay, so that means that we have to let a whole lot of stuff die.

**Speaker B:** The stilling of all formations.

**Speaker A:** The stilling of all formations means that those formations died and they're not reborn. Not reborn. We killed them all, took it right down to the root. But you see, Western Buddhism doesn't quite understand it from the perspective of— but this is actually doable. The way that it's written and the language that's used in the sutras makes it sound extraordinarily, extraordinarily over-the-moon difficult and hard to conceive, when in fact the whole point about deathless is easy. Yeah, if you don't own a laptop, then your laptop's never going to die. How easy is it for understanding that? So this is the— there you go.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you're talking about the battery life. Okay, I get it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that too, but eventually the whole laptop or something, the hard drive is going to go bad, you know, all that kind of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Well, I guess with the battery life, if you don't turn it on, it will never die, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't turn it on, it's not going to die.

**Speaker B:** It's not bored, it won't die.

**Speaker A:** So, um, what's the name— was— were you actually reading out of the Honeyball? Was that it? Or what?

**Speaker B:** No, not that. No, this one is— this is like the triplet to the two suttas that you always read, but you never— but this one you never get to. You always read MN 24 and MN 48. This is MN 64, which I would say is just like a relative of those other two that you usually talk about because you talk about 24 with the seven knowledges. A lot, which I think now that we've talked about it today is all about free will anyway. But I mean, because if you can have ownership over your mental state, that's— anyway, but yeah, this one is— the MN 24 is a lot about stream entry, but this is about going to either Anagami or Arahant, I guess you can say in traditional language. But by attending to the unconditioned or to the deathless in Jhana. And my understanding of Jhana, just my experience, is the best way that I describe Jhana is like a sense of deep understanding. It's almost like it's like a mental and a physical sense of like just understanding what you're— the world. And like all of the questions disappear. Like, so I like to think of it more as understanding than absorption or anything like that. Like, I don't know, I don't know how else to describe it.

**Speaker A:** Let me give you one then, okay? This has to do with something that's in Sutta number 39, where the Buddha talks about the five stories in regard to the hindrances, like being sick and getting well, like being in prison and getting out, like having a job and then getting fired, like being in debt and becoming debt-free. And the last one is like being on a journey and arriving at home. So that's the one that I would use. If I could put the first Jhana into just one word to describe it, I would use the word arrival. You have arrived. Okay, that's the place to rest, stay, right? That you are now in a holy place. This is a holy site now. Hang around.

**Speaker B:** That's probably why it feels like deep understanding to me, because my main disease is constantly trying to figure things out. And so when I get to Jhana, I feel like I have no questions.

**Speaker A:** So that's that. Freedom from that.

**Speaker B:** That's the arrival of that mental journey I've been on.

**Speaker A:** So of those 5, the one that I was using was the sense of arrival that I've been searching I've been traveling, I've been looking, I've been figuring it out, etc., like that. And so that arrival at home, that's what I felt like at Wat Soi Mokkh. I felt finally that I was at home, arrived. And you're saying it from the perspective of doubt, that there's— when you arrive.

**Speaker B:** There'S no best feeling in the world.

**Speaker A:** It's the best feeling to know that you've got it figured out now. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Trying not to be addicted to that is difficult, you know.

**Speaker A:** So other people may in fact experience it in other ways, in the sense of what a relief it is I don't have to go anywhere, like the job, being free from having a job, or the feeling of the lack of restrictions, like, oh, I'm not in jail. I don't have to stay on that road anymore, was the analogy that we had before. I'm not confined by my destiny or my habits.

**Speaker B:** I think we just, we just like shared a breakthrough here because like Jhana is different because, because somebody's psychological disposition changes their experience of Jhana. So like, let's say somebody whose life pursuit, like me, my pursuit of knowledge, I feel understanding. When I'm in Jhana. But somebody who, let's say, that they're always pursuing romantic relationships, when they arrive, then they'll feel like the sense of like, like deep love, maybe like, wow.

**Speaker A:** I've gotten all that. I got, I got enough of it now. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So whatever the search is, whatever the search ends, and it's just a different character depending on what your particular search was. Yeah. So that's kind of interesting.

**Speaker A:** You could also say in the sense of the ill will would be arguing. So when you get into 1 John, that's the end of the arguing. There's nothing to argue about and there's nothing to protect anymore. And so, these 5 stories is a very good way of us understanding then, that 1 John's primary point is to be free from these hindrances, to feel like that you have arrived instead of on your journey, to feel feel like that you've got it all figured out and there's nothing more to question about, there's no more doubts. To be feeling like I don't have to argue, I don't have to get my way anymore, that I'm okay. Okay. And also that one about sloth and torpor, or Hari Onopata, that one is that I'm not lost anymore. That I have, that I found it. So it's very much like the others, but that's the same thing as by being sick or being feeling bad. Oh, I just don't feel, you know. And then all of a sudden, wait a minute, okay. Like an example would be that you get up sick in the morning and you feel sick and you don't want to do anything. And then you recognize maybe an hour before before you actually need to do something, that something like, "Oh, my Uncle Tom is arriving this morning, I've got to go pick him up at the train," and all of a sudden, that "I feel bad," or "I don't have any energy," kind of melts away, it's almost like having a blowtorch put on you and you just jump! In fact, I've had that same experience. For the Saturday morning, that is, uh, that I'm all— I'm okay, and I'm still a little bit tired, and wait a minute, wait a minute, we got a call coming in 10 minutes, let me get up, I can do that. So it's that changing of an attitude, that being tired. So when we're in the first jhana, we don't feel tired, we don't feel grumpy anymore. That right now, this is good enough, everything's good enough. And so working with those hindrances and recognizing we can be free from all of those hindrances. But the point we're kind of making is, is that for many people, they've got a favorite. Mm-hmm. And yours is doubt. And mine is being in a hurry. I've been, I've been on a journey. In fact, I knew about that hurry-up driver. And so that's been my show my whole life. Gotta hurry up and get it done. I'm in a hurry now.

**Speaker B:** I think for me it used to be both, but definitely now that I've conquered— well, mostly conquered the hurry, but the doubt is— I keep thinking it's gone, but it's just because I always— when I'm really in it, I always tell my wife, like, I feel like I'm spinning. And then when I experience Jhana, that's the other feeling. It feels like I've been spinning. Like, you know, when you spin and you stop and the world keeps spinning, and then eventually it stops That's what it feels like, it stops spinning, becomes crystal clear and deeply, like a sense of deep understanding and deep satisfaction, like all of us just like, like— And.

**Speaker A:** That'S all we need, that's all we need, we don't need the other Jhanas, the first Jhana is good enough. But we have to stay in it, and in fact part of what that sutta is talking about is how to maintain that first Jhana, as opposed to how to get higher and higher, because there really is no higher, the first Jhana, that's it. The other— it's almost like you bought a house that's got a great big marvelous front room, but it also has bedrooms. Uh-huh. Okay. And that first Jhana is that magnificent front room. Yeah, you've got bedrooms, you've got bathrooms, you've got kitchens, that kind of stuff, but you spend most of your time in that living room where you live.

**Speaker B:** And so you want a bigger house.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Or you want a bigger house because this is not Jhana at all, right? Okay. That's— they're all houses that I make. But the point that I'm making about the, um, the higher jhanas are only that way in the sense of once you gather the factors of the first jhana and order the constituent factors that bring up the first jhana, the other jhanas are nothing but letting some of those factors go correctly.

**Speaker B:** So it's like you have all the jhanas you're just taking pieces off the first and then.

**Speaker A:** It becomes. Right, you're peeling off the.

**Speaker B:** Take off the PT and the sukkah or whatever.

**Speaker A:** We don't know the applied and sustained thought is.

**Speaker B:** I forgot about those two.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's what it takes, one from the first to the second Jhna. And the way that I can describe that is that we feel so good, we don't have to talk about it anymore. You just experience feeling good, which is.

**Speaker B:** The— you don't have to narrate the experience.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to narrate the experience anymore. It's too good to have the announcer. Shut up, I'm having too much fun, you know.

**Speaker B:** That's when you experience the noble silence.

**Speaker A:** Which is— yes, yes. And so then that Piti though that got us in there is overwhelming with how good we feel. And so going into the third jhana is when we let that relax into back to just Sukkha again, but it's a really cool kind of Sukkha. And so this is— yeah, it's okay. And that stability comes from the practice of the first jhana. The people can do the first jhana and then they want the second, the third, and the fourth. Well, that's just desire. How can you want something and still be in first jhana. You have to practice and practice that first jhana so that you get really good at the first jhana.

**Speaker B:** And the point you're making is once you're in first jhana, if you just relax, the other jhanas just unfold naturally because you're just relaxing away those other practices.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but not on schedule. Not on a schedule.

**Speaker B:** I feel like you have another student and I'm holding you up. No, no, no, I heard your, um, your, um, your messenger going. I was like, uh, that was, that was like 20 minutes ago, but never mind.

**Speaker A:** So, um, anyway, Michael, I think that this is a good time to stop. I think that we've gotten it going. At least I got my punchline out, and that's the important thing.

**Speaker B:** I'm impressed that you remembered it. Like after all that time, it still came back. I would have forgotten it at that point.

**Speaker A:** I am forgetful, but I generally have a theme going through. People will ask questions and stop along the way, and that slows things down. But normally there's a sequence of events to go through. And that joke about expensive will, that takes a long time to go through before anybody gets the point. And we've done a thorough discussion on that today. So thank you very much. I really enjoyed this talk. This has been great.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, you enjoy the rest of your day.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Or as I've been telling myself, be joy the rest of your day. It's just a little mantra I've made up.

**Speaker A:** I really think that your students are quite fortunate to have you around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I enjoy them.

**Speaker A:** The last point that I'll have to say is about that is that they probably wouldn't have been voting Republican anyway, but for sure with you being their teacher not a chance. But in fact, before, they might have voted Democratic. Now, after hearing you, they probably won't even bother to go vote. I mean, what a conditioning voting is.

**Speaker B:** They have— my students cannot figure out where I am on the political spectrum. They have no idea. They're always guessing.

**Speaker A:** That's because you're not on the spectrum.

**Speaker B:** That's what I tell them. They don't believe me.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you got it. You know, I don't have to take them.

**Speaker B:** I got off that. On that wheel. I used to be on it.

**Speaker A:** I know what it's like. So many people. I mean that. But well, the whole industry wants everybody involved. Everybody. The Democratic Party wants everybody to vote Democrat, and everybody in the Republican Party wants everybody to vote Republican. And they'll do anything. They'll lie, cheat, steal, lie again, put up a trance.

**Speaker B:** Your neighbors into enemies. You're supposed to love your neighbor as yourself, not turn everybody into enemies, you know. Like, um, it's not— this is not meant to be a sports arena, it's meant to be a country. Um, and, you know, you say see everybody as a friend, and it's really hard to do that when you're like locked into a political spectrum or any kind of fixed idea spectrum, you know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so One thing that I could say in that regard is that the teaching of the Buddha is in two levels. There is the ordinary beginner's level. There is the place where all Thai children and all Western adults start. That's where Ananda was when he came to the Buddha, believing in all kinds of things. And the whole point of the precepts and the way they are is to at least get society to the point that they're not going around killing each other. If we can learn to at least get along in a civil kind of way. But the higher teachings of the Dharma, the Noble Dharma, is to teach us that we can be friends with everybody. Now that's the higher noble. The first one is just don't kill them, refrain from hurting them and killing them, but you can hate them if you want to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just hate them inside, don't kill them.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But the noble teachings of the Dhamma is to make friends, because you don't want to hurt your friends.

**Speaker B:** You know, I used to get criticized by people. They'd be— they would tell me, guys, you're friends with everybody, you just like everyone. And I'd be like, okay, sure. That was like a criticism that I was given. Actually, when I was teaching in Thailand, one of my roommates was from Australia, and he was from like a far-right conservative Australian political party that was really sort of nativistic. But he was, he was also like a really great guy and had a great personality. And like, I loved him and I got along with him really well. And everybody else in my group like really judged me for, for getting along with him. But anyway, I don't want— we don't need to go down that road.

**Speaker A:** But I know that's how it is, everybody, right? Everybody wants you to be on their side when they hate somebody. It's always you and me against that guy. If you, if you're going to make friends with him, that means that you can't be friends with me. Yeah, yeah. No, I've got a skill here, boy, and I can be friends with you too. I don't care whether you hate that dude or not. I don't hate you.

**Speaker B:** Seeing everybody as a friend, um, because I did become a little bit misanthropic, like people-hating, um not people hating, but people averse. But ever since I've been like— the two mantras I take from you is everything is okay and everybody is a friend. So that takes all the objects in the world and all the people in the world and makes it okay. And that really just— that's helped me a lot. Just like when I'm— if I can't remember anything else, I remember those two things.

**Speaker A:** Remember that. That's the important thing. You got to keep remembering, remembering it, because those things are really easy to forget for the beginner. So it's important to remember that we're okay. It makes it fun. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** When I'm in the Sangha and somebody comes in and they're in a bad mood and they're really rude and I get the opportunity to be really friendly to them and then all of a sudden we're vibing with each other, I'm like, wow, that's magic. I've just done some chemistry there. Within 10 seconds, all of a sudden this person has become my friend. They're not like the angry, rude person anymore or whatever. You know. So I really enjoy that practice. Yeah. Okay. Good conversation.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's been good. I've enjoyed it.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, Kop Koon Kop as usual. Samadhi Kap. Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** My expense just ran out.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Bhante, yeah.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B), explores the Buddhist perspective on free will, conditioning, and the path to liberation. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Free Will is a Spectrum, Not an Absolute**
Dhammarato introduces the idea that free will is not a black-and-white issue but exists on a spectrum—a "fuzzy boundary" with "50 shades of gray." The discussion centers on how freedom emerges from wisdom and effort, not from an inherent, unchanging self.

### **Main Arguments and Insights**

1.  **Will is "Expensive," Not "Free":** True will (or agency) is not something we inherently possess. It is cultivated through persistent effort (*sammā vāyāma*, Right Effort on the Eightfold Path). We start in ignorance, driven by habits and conditioning, which create a sense of destiny. Freedom is earned by "paying the price" of diligent practice.

2.  **Conditioning vs. The Unconditioned:** Our normal state is one of *conditioning*—we react based on past habits, thoughts, and perceptions (*papañca* or conceptual proliferation). The goal of the path is to experience the *unconditioned* (the unborn, unbecome, unmade). This is not a separate metaphysical realm but the natural state when conditioning ceases—like a rash healing when you stop scratching it.

3.  **Agency Emerges with Wisdom:** In ignorance, we have little to no free will; we are run by craving and reaction. As wisdom (*paññā*) and insight grow, we gain the ability to "make a fresh choice." Real agency is the ability to respond wisely, not just react habitually. Dhammarato suggests that significant freedom (real will) begins at the level of a *Sotāpanna* (stream-enterer) and increases with further awakening.

4.  **Critique of "No Free Will" Teachings:** Speaker B expresses concern that popular non-dual and some Buddhist communities overemphasize the lack of free will, leading to passivity. They argue this is a misunderstanding that ignores the Buddha's teaching on the unconditioned as an escape from conditioned causality. True freedom comes from aligning with wisdom, not from surrendering agency.

5.  **The Practice: De-conditioning the Mind:** The practical method is to actively "de-condition" the mind.
    *   **Start with Thoughts:** Change unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones. This is the first point of control.
    *   **Use Jhana as the "Pasture":** The mind is like a wild horse or monkey. Meditation, particularly the first *jhana*, is like corralling it into a safe, wholesome "pasture." The first jhana is framed as a sense of **arrival**—the end of seeking, doubt, or inner conflict. Higher jhanas are simply natural relaxations from this stable point.
    *   **Two Mantras for Practice:** Dhammarato shares simple, powerful reminders: **"Everything is okay"** and **"Everybody is a friend."** These attitudes cut through judgment and ill-will, bringing the mind back to a peaceful, unconditioned state.

6.  **Philosophy vs. Direct Experience:** The discussion warns against getting lost in metaphysical speculation (about the unborn, consciousness, or reality). This is just another form of "mental samsara"—a cycle of birth and death of concepts. The path is about **direct experience** in the present moment, not constructing the right view but engaging in **right viewing**.

### **Key Metaphors and Analogies**
*   **The Eclipse:** Free will has a fuzzy boundary (penumbra), not a sharp line.
*   **Scratching the Rash:** The unconditioned is the state of healing that occurs when harmful conditioning (scratching) stops.
*   **The Domino:** Most people are like dominoes, falling predictably due to conditioning. Practice is like super-gluing one domino to the floor, breaking the chain.
*   **The Horse/Monkey Mind:** Meditation trains the wild mind to stay in the wholesome "pasture" of focused awareness (jhana).
*   **The Streetcar:** Experiences come and go; suffering or happiness depends on whether we cling to them after they've passed.

### **Conclusion**
The talk concludes that the Buddhist path is about moving from a state of passive destiny (driven by ignorance and habit) to one of active, wise agency. This is achieved not by claiming an illusory "free will," but through the hard work of de-conditioning the mind, cultivating jhana, and resting in the direct, unconditioned experience of the present moment. **True freedom is the "expensive will" cultivated on the path, culminating in the ability to let go of all conditioning.**

### Metaphors and Stories

This talk is rich with metaphors and stories to illustrate complex Buddhist concepts. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones used by Speaker A (Dhammarato):

### **Core Metaphors & Stories**

**1. The Eclipse & The Fuzzy Boundary (Penumbra)**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the nuanced Buddhist perspective on free will vs. determinism.
*   **Metaphor:** Free will is not a black-and-white issue (like a sharp shadow from an object close to a sheet). Instead, the boundary between free will and no free will is like the **penumbra of a solar eclipse**—a wide, fuzzy band of partial shadow. There are "50 shades of gray."
*   **Meaning:** Will is not absolutely free nor absolutely determined; it exists on a spectrum influenced by ignorance and wisdom.

**2. The Highway and the Fork in the Road**
*   **Purpose:** To describe how ignorance creates a sense of fixed destiny.
*   **Story:** An ignorant person thinks life is a **one-way highway** they must just endure. They fail to see the **scenery, parks, playgrounds on the side**, or the **fork in the road** where they could take "the road not taken."
*   **Meaning:** Wisdom reveals choices and alternative pathways that ignorance obscures.

**3. The Swordsman's Destiny**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how habits (kamma) become destiny.
*   **Story:** "He who lives by the sword dies by the sword." Even the greatest champion, if he makes violence his life's habit, will eventually be killed by a sword (or turn it on himself). He creates his own destiny through persistent action.
*   **Meaning:** Unwholesome habits, maintained over time, inevitably lead to corresponding suffering.

**4. The Doctor and the Itchy Armpit**
*   **Purpose:** To demystify the concept of the "Unconditioned" (Nibbana).
*   **Story:** A patient complains that scratching his armpit makes it sore. The doctor's advice: **"Stop scratching your armpit."**
*   **Meaning:** The "Unconditioned" is not a mystical realm. It is the **cessation of the conditioning activity** (the scratching). When you stop the cause (craving/ignorance), the effect (suffering) ceases, and you are "unconditioned."

**5. The Dominoes and Super Glue**
*   **Purpose:** To explain how choice interrupts causal chains.
*   **Metaphor:** Most people are like dominoes in a chain reaction—conditioned to fall (react) based on past causes. However, one domino can **choose to superglue itself to the floor** and not fall.
*   **Meaning:** Through wise effort (like super glue), we can stop the automatic, conditioned reaction and introduce a free response.

**6. Taming the Monkey Mind / Corralling the Wild Horse**
*   **Purpose:** To describe the meditation process of cultivating focus and wholesomeness.
*   **Metaphor:**
    *   The untrained mind is a **monkey** jumping from tree to tree (thought to thought). The practice is to **isolate it in a single tree** (a single wholesome object).
    *   Alternatively, the mind is a **wild horse** roaming dangerous canyons. We must patiently **corral it into a safe pasture** (wholesome mental states), where it will eventually prefer to stay.
*   **Meaning:** Meditation is a gradual process of limiting the mind's range to wholesome territory through sustained effort.

**7. The Computer Desktop Interface**
*   **Purpose:** To explain how we mistake our perceptions for reality.
*   **Metaphor:** (Attributed to Donald Hoffman) Space-time and physical objects are like the **desktop interface on a computer**. They are a useful perceptual construct, not fundamental reality. The "real" substance is consciousness itself.
*   **Meaning:** We live in a mentally constructed reality (*saññā*), not in direct contact with "things as they are."

**8. Salting the Food at a Restaurant**
*   **Purpose:** To describe how we automatically add mental conditioning to raw experience.
*   **Metaphor:** Being served a meal and immediately **pouring salt on it** before tasting.
*   **Meaning:** We habitually add our past judgments, concepts, and proliferations (*papañca*) to present-moment experience, obscuring its true nature.

**9. The Streetcar of Metaphysics**
*   **Purpose:** To show the irrelevance of abstract philosophizing compared to present experience.
*   **Story:** Two people ride the same San Francisco streetcar—one happily, one miserably. When they get off, the happy one is free, while the miserable one **carries his misery with him**.
*   **Meaning:** Obsessing over metaphysical questions (like "What is reality?") is like arguing about the streetcar's design instead of noticing your own state of mind *right now*. The key is your present experience, not distant concepts.

**10. The Obsession Profession (The Psychotherapist)**
*   **Purpose:** To show how we get trapped in cycles of mental proliferation.
*   **Story:** Children who go to psychotherapy often grow up to become psychotherapists themselves. They become **obsessed with the framework** that defined their early struggle.
*   **Meaning:** We often turn our personal fixations (whether metaphysics, politics, or a personal problem) into a lifelong identity, creating a "mental samsara."

**11. The Industrial Revolution Steam Engine**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how conceptual obsession prevents innovation and freedom.
*   **Story:** The steam engine was used for 100 years only to pump water from coal mines. It took another 100 years to move it into factories, and another 100 to put it on rails as a locomotive. Engineers were **obsessed with improving the existing application** and couldn't see radically new uses.
*   **Meaning:** Being trapped in old concepts (destiny/habits) blinds us to new possibilities (free will).

### **Key Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors:**
*   **Free Will vs. Destiny:** A spectrum, not a binary. Destiny is the rut of habit; free will is the expensive effort to change course.
*   **The Unconditioned:** The simple cessation of conditioning activity, not a separate metaphysical realm.
*   **The Path:** A gradual training (corralling the horse, gluing the domino) to replace reactive habits with wise responses.
*   **Right View vs. Right Viewing:** Any fixed "view" is just another mental construct destined to die. Freedom is in the **process of seeing** clearly in the present moment.
*   **Jhana as "Arrival":** The first Jhana is described as the feeling of **arriving home** after a long journey, where the specific search (for knowledge, love, an argument) finally ends.
