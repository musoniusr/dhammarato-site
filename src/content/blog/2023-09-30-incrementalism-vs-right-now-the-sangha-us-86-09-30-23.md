### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, I can take a picture of the creek that you're walking by. Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** It's usually dry and empty, but because of the rainy last few rainy days.

**Speaker A:** Right, rain season hadn't started yet. So continue on with the— with the what? Go into the hall.

**Speaker C:** Is that your house.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato? Hello, Corey.

**Speaker C:** How's it going, man? I could see the background kind of looks green like the place that you're at. Is that in Thailand too? Someone else is in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** This wat— glad you asked— this wat is on the island here. This is where, um, uh, Cattle is staying, and he's been there for quite a number of weeks now. It's a beautiful wat, well taken care of. Right now there's only 3 monks there. The abbot is still traveling. And so we're going into the Dhamma Hall now. Many wats, by the way, have more than one Dhamma Hall.

**Speaker C:** I also don't have a whole lot of time. I might leave at like 7:30 or— I just don't have a lot of time for a full thing. I'm not saying you have to start or do anything, but just if I have to leave suddenly and kind of go, like, it's okay, Cory.

**Speaker A:** Well, we'll let Kasten continue walking around with his camera there. Do you have any questions or anything that you want to talk about? About Cory?

**Speaker C:** I mean, like usually I used to talk about things that would be problems or difficulties that I have been having, but like as time goes on you have less and less difficulties, so it's not necessarily that I want to talk about something that I've been having difficulties with. But I don't know, that's so much of what we talk about and communicate is because it's like, I got a problem. You have the problem-based talking, and then you have maybe I just want to socialize in small talk. And then there's another section too, in between small talk and then— so I guess, you know, it would be kind of fun, exciting, right? Not like I really need to.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, tell me.

**Speaker C:** Everyone in spirituality enjoys talking about it. It's like the enlightenment thing, right? The change of identity or change of mindset, or I guess I hesitate to say goal, but there is some kind of experience of— it's not always personal identity, but there are basically changes that happen as a result of practicing and realizing and seeing things. So yeah, like basically, like I'm at the beginning or middle, whatever you want to call it, but I've been practicing. Maybe the end too, if I'm being confident. But I've been doing it for a while, right? So I— but I haven't been doing it for 20 or 30 years. So if you want to share like kind of like your life, because you've had very serious practice, you've done a lot, and kind of tell me what it might look like after 10 or 20 years me down the road, you know, in terms of like, you know, like what's it look like when— because I've— in the beginning you go up and down and then eventually you kind of— it's not maybe a plateau, but things stabilize. And that's where I'm kind of at. And so I'm kind of wondering, you know, what's over the horizon, what comes later on, if anything.

**Speaker A:** All right. Let us say that what comes over the horizon, or what's off into the future, is when you stop worrying about the future, that what you have right now is okay, that this is actually the teaching, and it is, every time that you practice correctly, immediately fruitful. And that what you're saying is, is that in the beginning you only got fruitful occasionally, and now you've gotten it so fruitful that you don't really have any more problems at all. But you're still speaking from a position of dissatisfaction in the sense that you're still wanting more. Now, here's kind of the thing that we have to understand, is that almost all of us have a frame of reference or a point of view that comes from our society, that we were trained this way our whole lives. And we can, for this conversation's purposes, boil that down to just one word. Incrementalism. Incrementalism means that you're going in a direction, making some progress towards that direction or towards that goal, and that most people approach Buddhism that way. In fact, that's the kind of questioning that you're asking. And so, the end goal then would be when we stop incrementalizing and just be there. So, the teaching of the Buddha, there's a secret to it, and that secret is his main teaching. He says in several suttas, "I only teach one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha." And what he means by that is, if you can see that Dukkha, it's either swallowing you whole in a sense of a misery or a pity party, or it's all over you in the sense of worry, or there it is in the sense of a bit of discomfort, or there it is a mile away, and that's wisdom. But the whole point is to continue to be able to see Dukkha so that we can be rid of it immediately. It's not an incremental kind of thing, but rather it's an immediate thing. So if you're practicing correctly, as you're practicing you're changing those unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts and getting the benefit of that immediately. You can actually continue to think along the same lines. An example of that would be that we're working on the website and we can say, "Oh gosh, we got so much to do. Oh, I've got to go do this and I've got to go do that, and all this is so much work." Or we can think about the website in the sense of, wow, it's looking good. Wow, we've got it. Wow, this thing is working. Okay? And we're thinking about the same kind of things on the website, but the attitude has changed from it's a big deal into, oh, there's nothing to it. And so this is what we have to practice, because we have been practicing our whole lives, oh, it's a big deal. We can't swallow it whole. We have to chew on it for a long time, cut it up into pieces. And really, when we think about it from that perspective, changing one's whole life Sounds like a great big deal, and yet changing this thought is easy. That's profound, because wanting to change one's whole life is incrementalism and is off into the future. But changing our unwholesome thought into wholesome thought Like, "Wow, I've got far to go," is an unwholesome thought. But, "Wow, I can do this," that's a wholesome thought. Now, there's places in Buddhism when they get to the point of saying no thought at all, and a lot of people who have no trained mind will try to get something that they can't get. That some things require some training. An example of that would be the Zen archers that are riding on a pony, drawing their bow, and hitting a target as they pass by. But look how much training they had to do with that. In fact, one of the trainings that they have is that they have a wooden pony, at the dojo, and the guy gets on the pony and learns to manage his bow, and then his friends come and rock that pony back and forth, actually trying to throw him off of it. And can he maintain the straddle, holding his legs? But you see, the training that he got to get on the pony the first time is the same training that he's using to stay on it when his friends are bouncing it all over. Well, hello, Ann. We're talking about the Dharma in two frames of reference. One is immediate and the other is incremental. And our style, our culture, our system has to do with incremental, that we see projects as great big things and we can only do a little bit of it at a time. And basically the teaching of the Buddha is completely different than that, in the sense of, instead of looking at a project as a big project that has a whole lot of stuff to do to it, we can see that in fact there's nothing to it, just this one little thing. The example that I used was changing one's whole life is a great big thing, and we can only do that a little bit at a time. But changing this thought is easy enough, and that's the goal right there. The goal is to change one's mind and changing it right now. And when we change it right now, we get the benefits of that right now. So when we're thinking about a project, instead of thinking about it, worrying about it in the sense of, oh, I got to do this and oh, I got to do that, and see it as a whole lot of work to do, we can look at each aspect of that project and say, "Oh, we can figure out how to do that. Oh, this is easy enough. Oh yeah, that's a good idea." And we always stay in the positive realm. But that always staying in the positive realm has to start someplace, and that is having that first wholesome, noble thought. And so we practice that over and over again, because if we're not practicing, it will fall back into the old habits. Just like driving a car, if you keep your eye on the road and are maintaining that, you can stay in your lane and you could be a fairly safe driver. Especially if you're watching all around you, so that you watch behind, you see the traffic behind you, you see the traffic in front of you, you notice the runs that are having road rage, etc., like that. But the main thing is, is that you can maintain your speed and stay in your lane. And if you're not watching where you're going, you'll drift off into another lane and possibly have an accident or a wreck or get killed or something like that. Yet when we live our lives, we expect that things are going to be kind of on automatic pilot and that the car, life itself, will drive itself. That does sometimes for a while, but the whole teaching of the Buddha is to watch where you're going right now. Keep your eye on the road when you're driving and keep your eye on your mind as you're living your life in Dharma, to keep your eye on it. Now, one of the major teachings of the Buddha, in fact, there are Suttas about this, where people have converted into becoming followers of the Buddha and then ordaining over this one point, and that is that in Brahmanism and in our society, we have the idea that our actions are the big deal. In other words, if somebody robs a bank and does the action of robbing the bank, then that's a high crime. If somebody is preparing to rob the bank, and taking actions, like casing the bank, drawing drawings of the layout of the bank, watching the times that things happen, etc., like that, buying explosives, buying weapons, that's getting prepared for it, and that's still actions. But if you think about robbing the bank, there's no laws against that. This is what we think of as free speech, which bases in free thought. And this is where the Buddha says, "Oh no, the mind is the forerunner." Nobody goes and robs a bank unless they think about robbing the bank. Nobody prepares to rob a bank unless they're thinking about preparing to rob the bank. So, if you get angry at someone, that's because you have a thought about getting angry at someone. So the mind is always the forerunner. And yet in our society, just like in the time of the Brahmins, they thought that the action What's the big deal? And so we can think of it like that, Corrie, is that the big deal is how we live our life, and how we live our life is basically the way that we think about living our life. We have to have one good, wholesome thought after another, and that then becomes the good life—one wholesome thought after another. Yes, Anna, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** From my experience, people get angry not always when they think. They get angry before they think.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's not the case.

**Speaker D:** No?

**Speaker A:** That always we— let us say that the cup fell on the floor and then we get angry. All right, so we already have the pre-thought position of, oh, cups should not fall on the floor. And so that's, that's part of the Samskara, that's part of the rule system that we already have built up. Cups should not fall on the floor. And so when we see the cup falling on the floor, there are thoughts of, oh no, It's going to fall on the floor. And then when it does hit the floor, that's when the explosion of anger happens. But there was a lot of stuff going on in the mind before that. This is why the Buddha talks about the mind being the forerunner, that in fact, if your mindset was, oh, these cups are old their last year's model. Let's have some fun and break the cups. And so now that's the foundation, and someone picks up a cup and throws it, and while it's in the air, we have that anticipation, and when the cup actually breaks, we can say hip hip hooray, or wow, I like that. So anger, you're saying, is thoughtless, it just comes up, and the answer to that is, yes, but it springs from a basis. And when we see that basis, we can begin to change it, but we have to look for it. And this example is that, "Oh, I'm going to have fun breaking cups," versus cups should not be broken. This is what is called the Samskara. And that the Samskara, our past, all of those rules and regulations, then have an effect upon, or have causation for our perception. But in fact, when the cup is in the air, all we see is the cup in the air. And when we see the cup strike the floor and break up, all we have is the sight of the pieces of the cup. But even the word cup is part of our Sankhara. We know what it is. So this is what we mean by the mind is the forerunner, because it's the foundation. Now, when we see the cup flying through the air or falling on the floor, that we have to perceive that in the sense of understanding that it is a cup that's falling onto the floor, and that many people are very quick so that they can catch that cup in the air. And when they catch the cup in the air and they prevent it from falling, are they going to be angry then? No, because the thought is, "I caught the cup." And the anger will come when they have the thought, "Oh, I did not catch the cup," or, "I could not prevent the cup from falling." So, in this regard, I understand when you say that people get angry spontaneously, but there's really a whole sequence of events that happen before them. And this, by the way, is what we mean by Paticcasamuppada, the causality, that seeing the cup fly through the air is then perceived as, oh no, it's going to break, and oh, I can catch it, and then the actual art of catching the cup in the air before it falls and breaks. This is all the forerunner that's part of the perception and also part of our internal understanding of it. So the cup in the air does not have any effect upon us until it's processed. And that what we can learn to do in our lives, Corey, is to start to change that process. Now, one of the things that we could do would be, oh, the cup is broken and I've gotten angry about it, and my anger is not going to fix the cup, therefore there is no reason to be angry. And we can talk ourselves out of being angry. Oh, settle down, it's just a cup, there's nothing to it. And then I can get over my anger, right? So that's the whole point then, is that when we can see our anger as unwholesome, we can stop it. If we can see the thoughts that lead up to the anger also is unwholesome, we can stop it. Now, in the situation of just sitting, practicing Anapanasati, that's when we can begin to really look at those thoughts. Thoughts about doing something, thoughts about cups falling on the floor, any of those kinds of thoughts. And the question is, can we now change them into wholesome thoughts? And if we can change the thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome, like, "Wow, it's really fun to watch that cup break," instead of, "Oh no, the cup is broken, poor me." So these are the kind of thoughts that we have. If we can have wholesome thoughts, then the anger won't come up. The anger will always come up because of unwholesome thoughts. And as you were saying, you're changing so that the likelihood, Corey, of you getting angry now is nowhere near the likelihood of it was 10 years ago.

**Speaker C:** Every now and again I get caught into it. You know, when you really have a big wave of anger, it feels enjoyable, like you want to do it. But when you look at it with wisdom, you're like, you know what, it's actually not such a good idea. But it is pretty rare. I used to get angry frequently, and now it's maybe a couple times a month, maybe a couple times a year. It's really, really infrequent.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's look at that quality then that you mentioned of that when we get angry, we like it. All right, where does anger come from is almost always from fear. Like the cup falls and breaks, and then the first thought is, oh no, I need that cup, or oh no, that cup should not be broken. Now those kinds of thoughts can happen well within the tenth of a second.

**Speaker C:** Very well. One other thing I was thinking too is that the anger comes from realizing that the cup can never be what it was before. So if we like, right, so we're kind of like, it's like, oh, now I definitely can't do anything about it. The only thing I could do is get angry, make sure this person doesn't drop my cups anymore, or that I don't drop my cups. But I thought that would be good to add too, that the sense of it can never be the same, can never go back, can never be the way I wanted it to be.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so that, oh no, it'll never be the way that it was, is the kind of thought that is accompanied by the first initial fear. All right. And so fear then is covered up by anger. But fear is the motivation. People generally don't get angry until they feel like that they're losing something or missing something.

**Speaker C:** What is fear? Because I commonly think of it as a restriction of your mind, or it's kind of like a shadow comes over you, you can't see anything. So, but I've always kind of struggled to figure out what exactly was fear.

**Speaker A:** Well, what fear basically is, is a chemical system that happens both in the brain and also in the body, especially when it grows into absolute real fear. So we're talking about the Anagami, the tiny little bit of fear that can precede anger. Some people can stay afraid a long time before they get angry. And other people will take just a tiny little fear and turn that into anger very quickly.

**Speaker C:** So fear is aversion. In the Buddhist teaching, it's like resistance. I don't want that. That's fear.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so in the body, the chemical reaction then is from the pineal and the pituitary glands that are in the back of the head through the lymph system. Very, very quickly, within a tenth of a second, send information to the Adrenaline gland that is sitting on top of the kidneys. Now here's an interesting question for you: Why isn't the Adrenaline gland up there with the Pituitary glands and make things more efficient in the brain? The answer is, is that the Adrenaline gland needs the kidneys and the liver in order to get the products, the chemicals that it's going to use to manufacture the adrenaline and pump it into the bloodstream right where it's needed, close to the heart. So there's always a fight or flight syndrome, they call it, that comes up. The flight is the fear and the fight is the anger. And that preceding that is often, in the process of figuring out what's going on, there's a freeze. And so we freeze up, we can't think. That in fact, it's very, very commonly known in many different areas, including in debating, they have the rule of no ad hominem attacks, which means you can only attack what the person is defending; you can't attack him, because if you attack him, then that fear of, "Oh no, I'm losing something"— he can lose the debate, he can lose his point, and that's nothing much. But if he loses himself, oh no! And so they get frustrated and fearful, and then that fear turns into anger, to defend himself. And so now the debater is not going to be nearly as good in his debating, because he's under attack. He feels it. So this is also true in martial arts of various kinds, that if you can get your opponent really angry at you, then he's going to be taking actions based in anger rather than in wisdom. And oftentimes getting your opponent angry is half the battle, because now he can't think straight. He can only think of one revenge and one thing, and that is the revenge he's got to hurt you. And he's not watching a lot of stuff, so you can trip him up and all kinds of things when you can get your opponent angry. Okay, so here's the point about it though, is that anger always has the forerunner of fear, the fear of loss. These things happen really fast in the mind. And so if we can now sit down in a calm place and start looking at the thoughts, often what will happen is that we will see thoughts of revenge. Oh, I'm going to get that guy back. We think about arguments that we've had. We think about getting even with people. I mean, surely you don't want to admit it, but you know it's true. In fact, a lot of our thoughts, I would say more than half of our thoughts, are about revenge. I'm going to take revenge on that car by fixing its flat tire.

**Speaker C:** If you think of solving a problem as revenge, I mean, that's the majority of our thoughts. So like, that would make sense, you know. We're going to get revenge on what caused us pain by curing it and resolving it.

**Speaker A:** So that makes sense, fixing things that are broken. And we don't like that it's broken, and so we're going to take revenge upon that brokenness. And we live in our society, many people live their whole lives that way, taking revenge upon the boss by not doing the best job that we could. Taking revenge upon the company by taking some of its paper and pencils home. Taking revenge on the store by shoplifting.

**Speaker C:** I do only have— I got time for one last thing. I don't want to cut you off, but like, before I get going, real quick: being led by wisdom. So what I think that means is you want to be the big forest, see the big see the big picture. You want to see the forest. And anger and fear are restrictions to where we could only see the one path that would remove the fear or the anger. So I've been trying to kind of like think about this and practice it and really wonder like, what is being led by wisdom? How do you let wisdom— because I really know well how to not let anger guide my decisions, how to not let fear guide my decisions, Not letting desire lead your decisions is quite difficult, but I'm getting there. And having wisdom guide all of your decisions seems to be the most difficult. I haven't quite figured that one out, but let me know what you think.

**Speaker A:** Let's go back to the desire. If you can see the desire when it comes up, and often desire is a form of revenge. I'll feel better if I get what I want. And so we take revenge to get what we want. We're trying to set things straight. That's what the word vengeance is. It's the same word as justice or getting even. And so when we want something, there's a sequence of events that happens in the mind. It also happens very quickly. And the first thing that happens is, "Oh, I like it. I want that to be true, because I would like it." So the liking then becomes wanting. "Oh, I would like for it to be true. I want it to be true." And then the next step is as though, "Oh, I would like it to be true, therefore it has to be that way. I need it to be true." And this is also where the idea comes in, is that, "Oh, it would be good if it were true." This is where our judgments come into it, is that if I like it, then it's good, and if I don't like it, then it must be bad, not good. Now, wisdom is different than that because it's not based upon liking and not liking; it's based upon mere observation. To observe and to look and to see. And oftentimes when we're feeling and wanting, We're not looking, we're not observing. When people are having a pity party, it's really hard to get their attention so that you can talk them out of it. They would rather feel bad, and so they will continue to have thoughts about feeling bad and not pay attention to the fact that right now you're not hurting, you're just sitting and thinking, and you're feeling bad because of what you're thinking about. But the reality is that you're okay. You're sitting on the couch, you've got a cup of coffee, you've got friends trying to help you get out of your pity party. Why isn't that a marvelous place to be? And so if we see things as reality, that means then we stop with these perceptions of how it should be. And those 'hows it should be' is also in a cycle back from what we like. So, if I like it, and I want it, and I need it, it must be good, so the next thought that I have about it, 'Oh, it needs to be that way. It's supposed to be that way.' And here's where we build up these rules. The human brain is actually quite marvelous in the sense of how it is so fast and makes stuff in there that you would think, "Oh, well, there's no hope for us because the mind works so quickly." And the answer to that is, again, that this is not an incremental kind of thing; we don't fix the mind slowly, we fix it right now! And then it gets broken again, and so we fix it again right now. And if we fix it and fix it and get into the habit of changing it from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought, now that leaves us space to actually observe that in fact that would be one of the wholesome thoughts of, well, let me look at it again. Let's keep observing, let's keep looking. That oftentimes we go from the position— this is a habit that we have, it's not necessary, but the habit is, is that I see it and then I connect it with a rule about what it's supposed to be like, and I wind up then not liking. See, think, feel. See, think with the rule. Perception which leads into the feeling. So if we can interrupt that by saying, 'See,' and not think about it but just see it again, or see, think, but then go back to seeing again, so that we get into the state of seeing and seeing and seeing and seeing. So let's go back to that cup dropping on the floor, that it was right here, I saw it fall, and in the mind— this is how fast the mind is— it makes a trajectory of where the cup is going to go because of— based upon— I can see this and then I can see that and then I can say it's going to be over here. And so I'll put my hand there and catch the cup. Another example then would be baseball, that the baseball player, number one, throws the baseball, and then the catcher is watching that ball flying through the air at 100 miles an hour and can reach up, stand, move, catch that ball, within a very, very short period of time, and then the audience is all aghast at how marvelous he is. But really, it means that he is looking at that ball, planning its trajectory, and then catching it. This is a skill to be developed. But if that same baseball player goes out on the field right after his wife and he has a great big fight, Then the ball is in the air, he has a thought of his wife, he sees the ball again, he has a thought of his wife, and then he misses the ball when it gets to him. That good athletes in fact make good Dharma students, because they can watch, and watch, and watch, and keep their mind watching and seeing the trajectory, as opposed to doing a little bit and then making a rule or bringing up a rule about how it should be, and then having a feeling about it's not doing the way that I want it to. And so this is the way that we can gather wisdom, is by stop talking to ourselves so much about what it should be like and see the things the way that they really are. An example would be, here I am laying in bed thinking about getting up and going to work. Oh, I don't want to go to work. Oh, let me have a few more moments, etc., like that. And then the Anapanasati student can say, wait a minute, I'm not at work. Why am I thinking about work? Why don't I lay here thinking instead of how marvelous it is to just lay here in bed, taking a deep breath and reflecting on how nice life is? Oh wow, this is good right here, right now. And so this is the whole point that I was starting at from the beginning, is to stop looking at life as incremental, moving from one place to another until we get to the final destination, and instead just have thoughts about how nice things are right now. That laying in bed, there's nothing to fear. So why are we fearful about going to work? We're having thoughts about it. The mind is the forerunner. If we're thinking about work, we're going to have feelings about work. If we stop thinking about work while we're laying in bed and start thinking about how nice it is to lay here in bed, then we've got it right there. Yes, Anna, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** If things are not good, if you're sick, very sick, everything is wrong, what to do?

**Speaker A:** Those are thoughts though. And what to do about it is, is that start thinking about positive thoughts about the sickness. Oh, I can handle this. Oh, I'm going to get better. Things are going to be okay. Meanwhile, right now I'm not that sick. I can at least have a happy thought about right now. Hey, while I'm sick, I don't have to go to work. I can just lay here in bed. And so thoughts about being sick are often unwholesome, and it keeps us sick for a longer period of time. An example of that right here— this is a real one— and that is, is that over time, in old age, I'm beginning to have hip pain, pain in the butt. When I'm sitting up in a chair. And yet, if I want to get something done and want to get something done and want to get something done, I'll sit in that chair and ignore the pain until it gets too much. And then the thoughts of, oh, poor me, my hip hurts. But if I would pay attention to the pain when it's very small, I could say, okay, now is enough. Get out of the chair and give the hip a rest. And if we do it that way, then we don't have to put up with near so much pain. That in fact, most people who get sick, get sick because they do not pay attention to the little bit of sick and take care of it. They wait until they get really sick and then they still don't take care of it. They wallow in misery about, "Oh, poor me, how sick I am," rather than having thoughts about, "I can handle this, I can take care of this." And so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually talks about it in the sense that being sick is a marvelous opportunity to practice the Dhamma. Very beginners, they don't understand this, and it's very hard for them to practice having wholesome thoughts while they're sick. But once a student begins to practice having wholesome thoughts and can have those wholesome thoughts, then he can come out of that unwholesome thoughts about being sick. For instance, tired. Oh, the body is so tired, let's give it the rest it needs. Oh, the body is sick, in the sense of it's got pain in a certain place, let's let that rest. And so we're paying attention to the pain and doing it wisely, rather than not liking it and continuing to do what we were doing before. Oh, I've got to go to work, and so I get up and go to work sick, maybe make other people at the office sick also. But we're supposed to go to work. That's a rule. And so we will often have our rule systems override the reality. And the reality is, is that everything is okay right here, right now. That's the reality. Everything is all right. It's real. It's happening. If we can see that that way, then we can marvel in reality itself rather than having rules about how reality should be and then feeling bad because it doesn't match up to our expectations. The reality is real. Let us enjoy what's real, and how we enjoy what's real is by observing what's real. Rather than talking to ourselves about what you don't like about reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you have to repeat it so many times. You have to really do it so many times because there's always this subtle background expectation, thought, feeling that this isn't good enough. It's— you have to pile it on, like you have to repeat until you really feel like, oh, this is actually— this is good enough. Like it's a real direct feeling.

**Speaker A:** It's a direct feeling of everything is okay. It's a relief, and we're looking for that, giving ourselves that relief immediately. And when we're practiced well, we can gain that relief immediately. For beginners, it takes a little bit. I've got to keep— I can find that relief. I've got that relief. Oh, finally the relief comes. Often the relief is based also with breathing. If we can take good long deep breaths while we're laying there in bed and saying, "Oh, it's so nice to have this air and I'm breathing and everything is okay and everything is fine, everything is hunky-dory." But then the thoughts will drift over to something else that you got on your mind. And that's associated with work, and now we're thinking about, oh, I got to get up and go to work. If we could see that and say, wait a minute, I'm not going to go to work in my mind right now, I'm not going to go into solving problems, I'm going to lay here and tell myself how nice things are right now. No problems need to be fixed right now. And so over and over and over again, like Kat says, is that we've got to keep coming back to: everything right now is okay. That we don't have to go incrementally fix things, one little thing after another, and then we can gain the goal of being okay. That we're already okay. Let's just have thoughts about everything right now is okay.

**Speaker D:** Can you please repeat about justice? Because somehow it's the same as the pain. Is it too much pain? It's not working. It's too hard. It might be working, but it's too hard. The same injustice. If it's too much injustice, it's not working. You kind of look at it and saying it's okay. It's hard to say.

**Speaker A:** All right. But the fact is, is that that injustice, you're not going to have any effect upon it. By thinking about it, that all that injustice is doing is putting injustice in your mind. And in fact, the injustice has always been in your mind. Having thoughts of things are not right, things are not just, is a mental concept. And if you can see that you're judging things, "Oh, this is not right, oh, Putin's not good, oh, Eastern Europe's got this trouble, oh..." New York's got this trouble, but we're not going to be able to fix New York. But in fact, we can see New York is OK the way that it is—rats, sewers, and bad traffic and all. And in fact, a lot of the point about the bad traffic and all of that is because so many people want to go to New York. They think it's a marvelous place. And the reality is, is that New York is just a place, it's just real. And we can just say, "Oh, I understand New York is real, I don't have to fix it, I don't have to apply my rules of, 'Oh, you should go there,' or, 'Oh, you should shoot the mayor,' or, 'Oh, you should go catch rats,'" or whatever "Oh, you should dos" are. We could just say it's all right right now. Anna, the mayor of New York is not in the room with you. The rats are not in the room with you. Those tourists are not in the room with you. Those cars and the traffic are not in the room with you. In the room that you're in, the reality is everything is okay. And the mind goes outside of the room to go find problems and injustices. And the idea is, is to come back into the reality. The reality is, is that you're in a room and that you're safe right now. Can you feel safe?

**Speaker D:** So I can go and find some. So what are you gonna do with this? I'm not gonna say it's okay.

**Speaker A:** I can't come. It is okay. See, you're telling yourself something that you've heard before, that it's not okay. That's a thought, and that thought is based upon a concept or an old rule. For instance, you don't like getting old, but you are going to be getting older and older.

**Speaker D:** I don't like if somebody gonna torture me or kill me. So in the moment somebody torturing me, I don't like it. And I think it's gonna be injustice if it happens to me or someone else. All right, whatever.

**Speaker A:** But that will keep you— that will keep you stuck in that miserable life. That if you can say, oh, if I stay in this room Right now, nobody's coming in to kill me. Why should I be thinking about somebody coming to kill me? Right now, there's nobody in the room telling you how bad a person you are. There's nobody there except your own mind. And it's your own mind that's telling you, 'Oh, it's bad when people criticize you.' Well, that was because you developed that habit as a child. You did not like to be criticized when you were a child. But now you can have the thoughts of, "Oh, I bet I can handle being criticized. I bet I could do that. I mean, I survived all those times that I was criticized. It didn't kill me. So I survived. I can survive the next one too." And then maybe the next thought would be, "Bring it on. Go ahead, criticize me." I'll show you that it can't hurt me. Go ahead, try to kill me. You can't find me. How could you possibly kill me if you can't find me? That in fact, that's the same thing true with criticism, that they're trying to kill you with their words, they're trying to criticize you. If that target— if that arrow hits the target, that's because you put that target up there. Otherwise, they're just shooting arrows off into the world. But you stand up and say, oh, it's me that's being criticized, instead of having the thought of, oh, they don't know who I am, they can't touch me. They can't touch me. They can't criticize me.

**Speaker D:** Torturing and criticizing, it's not the same thing. I'm not saying that I am the one who tortured. I'm saying that it's maybe the poor option of the injustice.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's come out of it being unjust and getting into the position of that's just what's happening. All right, you, you certainly have heard the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible, in the Genesis, that by judging, by noticing what was— they had the knowledge of what was good and what was evil, and that knowledge of good and evil, that rule-making, is why they were, uh, they lost their paradise. If you can stop your judgments If you could stop your criticism and recognize that their criticism is not your criticism. I wasn't going— Hey, Cat, can you turn your mic off? So yeah.

**Speaker B:** Only, only, uh, only a Russian girl came.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're It's really noisy there, Kat. Can you turn your mic off? All right, good. So I still hear an echo now. Can you turn up your mic, Kat? Can you turn off your mic? So I don't— I hear an echo back now. Anyway, and let's get back to what we were talking about in the sense of the story of Adam and Eve. They ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, and that's what you're doing. You're talking about those people are bad, they're too— they're They're criticizing, they're angry, they're uptight, there's something wrong with them. And that's the judgment. The answer for you is, yes, they're angry, yes, they're uptight, yes, they're criticizing, but that's not who you are. But when you say, oh, it's wrong for them to criticize, oh, it's wrong for them to be angry, now you're making the rules and you're trying to change reality. And the way to handle that instead is, "Oh, it's okay that they're angry. It's okay with me that they're criticizing. I'm okay. They can't touch me. I can stop judging what they're doing and be okay, because my judging of them is not going to change them. It's only going to make you and me feel bad." By judging, having the idea of this is what it should be. So we have the rule of, oh, the cup shouldn't fall on the floor, is kind of the same rule as, oh, they should not criticize each other, oh, they should not criticize me. I'm wonderful, I'm perfect, why are they criticizing? And so we're off into our own little pity party right then and there. Instead of saying, "It's okay that they criticize, that's what they're doing, that's real. Why am I fighting with what's real, when I can just enjoy what's real?" But this is why we want to change the mind from the unwholesome thought, "Oh, they should not criticize," into the wholesome thought of, "Oh, they can't touch me, they can't hurt me, I'm okay." I'm just sitting here in the room, and in fact all those criticisms that I don't like, I heard in the past. They're not happening right now. And right now, nobody's criticizing you, except you're thinking about it. And so we can stop thinking about being criticized, we can stop thinking about cups falling, we can stop thinking about the rats in New York and the traffic and all of that. And start thinking about what's real for you right now, that you're sitting there in your room and none of that stuff is happening. Isn't that marvelous? Isn't that marvelous? You don't have to deal with New York traffic right now. Isn't it marvelous? You don't have to deal with New York rats right now.

**Speaker D:** Yes, but it's easy. It's an easy prerequisite. The hard prerequisite is you become a saint and you go to cross So you are in the cross, and why.

**Speaker A:** Should you go to the cross?

**Speaker D:** You are, you are marvelous.

**Speaker A:** I mean, that's what they actually— let's, let's do that. Let's play with that for just a second. Uh, this being on the cross is an analogy about Jesus being on the cross, right?

**Speaker D:** It's analogy to suffering, anyone. But it's right, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but it's not just suffering, it was punishment. Then in fact, we punish ourselves, we hang ourselves up on the cross because of what we don't like. But let's follow this story just a little bit, and that is, is that Jesus went to Jerusalem for the first time. He had never been to Jerusalem before. That's very plainly stated in the Bible. And not only that, but he was dead in a week hanging up on the cross. What happened? Well, he went to the temple and he did not like the money changers. He did not like the bankers in the temple. And because of his not liking, he took an action and they reacted to that by putting him on a cross. And so You can start living your life so that you can avoid being on the cross by avoiding not liking. If he had waltzed into that temple and say, oh, it's really nice and they're changing money and they're selling animals and all of that kind of stuff, and walked back out, he wouldn't have gotten crucified. If he had gone to Caiphas, the head priest, and say, hey, I bet you can make more money if you put those bankers out on the courtyard and have the whole temple to yourself. He could have handled it that way, but oh no, he let his feelings get in the way. He did not like the bankers, and so he did something about it, and that got him up on the cross. And since then, all of Europe and the West has all been about this being on the cross, when in fact it was a really stupid maneuver that Jesus did that put him on the cross. So, if you stop your own stupid maneuvers, you're not going to get strung up. What were our stupid maneuvers? They are based upon our liking and not liking, just based upon a set of rules that we have made up. And when you can see, "Oh, I made up a rule that the temple should not have money changers." and I can drop that rule and mind my own business. And so when somebody criticizes you, instead of enforcing the rule, "Thou shalt not criticize me," we can say, "Oh, they just made a rule. Let them criticize, because they can't touch me. I refuse to feel bad because they criticize." So all of the problems of the world Anna, are really not in the world, they're in your mind in the sense that you don't like it. And when you can come to the point that whatever is happening, that's okay with you, then you do become the saint. But real saints don't get strung up, they don't get crucified. It's ordinary people who get crucified because they're trying to fix things that they think are broken. Whereas somebody else may think that's the right way to do it: "Oh, it's good for me to criticize you." And if he has that position, he also has a position: "But it's not good that you criticize me." And in fact, most people have both those rules: "It's okay for me to criticize you, but it's not okay for you to criticize me." And the reality is, is that there is criticism. If we had the rule of, "Oh, I'm not going to bother to criticize anybody because I don't think they've got anything worth criticizing over," and we can also have the rule of, "Oh, when they criticize, they're criticizing their idea of me, they're not criticizing me." Why? Because I'm a movable target. If they criticize me, Dhammarato, the a Dharma teacher, well, guess what? Dhammarato is not a Dharma teacher, not right now. He's too busy having fun and not being criticized. So we can actually change our position. We can learn to dance. We can learn to dodge those arrows, just like in baseball, if we have the capability of watching the trajectory of what's happening and being able to catch the baseball, then we can also play dodgeball in the sense that we can watch the trajectory of where that ball is coming, and we can make sure we don't get hit with it. And here you have been spending your whole life, Anna, standing up and getting hit, and then not liking it; standing up and getting hit by criticism and not liking it. So now you can begin to see the criticism coming and dodge it and say, 'Oh, it wasn't me,' and then you can be very happy. 'Oh, he missed me. Oh, he can't get to me.'.

**Speaker D:** I cannot connect it to myself. It's kind of hard for me.

**Speaker A:** I don't— Well, it's not hard. That's an unwholesome word right there. It's not hard. You can change your mind. You can have the rule of you can change your mind rather than, oh, it's hard.

**Speaker D:** Change mind and what? Change mind and what?

**Speaker A:** To change the mind from, oh, it's hard, into, oh, it's easy to change my mind. It really is easy to change the mind. I mean, the mind's jumping around all the time, so wherever it lands right now, you can change that.

**Speaker D:** Yes, it is. It's not a problem. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's not a problem.

**Speaker D:** Not really. It's not a problem, but problem is about injustice. I will be above injustice. It's not a problem.

**Speaker A:** All right. But the injustice is a rule in your mind. The rule about injustice is in your mind. You can change that from the world is not just into the world can't touch me.

**Speaker D:** That I don't care about me. I don't care. I care about like poor dog, or I don't know, Jews in the Holocaust. I'm not talking about me.

**Speaker A:** All right, but right now the Jews are not in the Holocaust, except in your mind when you think about it. So stop thinking about the Jews and the Holocaust. Stop thinking about the Jews and the Holocaust because you can't change it.

**Speaker D:** But what about justice? What about those justice which we see, those all these gods in New York standing in the courts with the justice?

**Speaker A:** They're not in your room right now. Why are they in your mind right now?

**Speaker D:** Because I'm thinking about justice.

**Speaker A:** I know. And if you would stop thinking about it.

**Speaker D:** When you mentioned justice, they came to my mind.

**Speaker A:** So stop thinking about justice. Stop thinking about it. When you think about justice, says, oh well, I don't have to worry about justice right now, I'm okay without justice. Because you're not going to go get justice anyway. You're not going to put on a Superman costume, you're not going to put on a Wonder Woman costume with your whip and go out there and fix things. That's a movie. Let's not have those movies of you going out and fixing the world. Let's have movies of right now the world's okay. Right now there is no Jewish Holocaust. That's in the past. Let's leave the past alone.

**Speaker D:** So I just don't supposed to care about it? I just leave it?

**Speaker A:** I didn't say about caring, okay? And that's one thing that you can say is that the word care, the word care is the same word as carrying. So stop carrying the Holocaust, set it down, stop caring about it. It's not yours, it doesn't belong to you. And in fact, the judging of what I can see, you were either a tiny baby or weren't even born yet when the Holocaust happened. But it happens over and over again in your mind. And all you have to do is say, oh, I don't have to think about the Holocaust, that was so long ago. Let me think about being in the room right now. Let me think about being here now. And right here, right now, there's no Holocaust. Isn't that marvelous? You don't have a Holocaust in your room, you only have a Holocaust in your mind. And all you have to do is change your mind, throw that Holocaust out. Say, "Haha, I don't have to think about the Holocaust right now, I can feel good instead, because right now there is no Holocaust in the room. There are no rats in the room, there are no mares in the room, there's no traffic in the room. That right now, New York in this room is okay." And so these are the kind of thoughts that we need to start having, over and over and over again. Because look, all of this time, every thought that you've had about the Holocaust hasn't fixed the Holocaust at all. So why should you care about it? Because it doesn't matter how much you care, you're only hurting yourself with this care because you're carrying it. That what we need to do is to let it go, relinquish it, set it down, stop thinking about the Holocaust. Just stop! Start thinking about what's real right now. And what's real right now for me is I live in a paradise. I've got green everywhere, there's a nice breeze blowing. Yeah, there's mosquitoes on the floor biting the ankles, but I can handle that. I can handle the mosquitoes, and if I get the idea that I can't handle them, then I'll put on a mosquito coil and let the mosquito coil handle the mosquitoes. And everything right now is okay. That's the attitude, is everything right now is okay, doesn't need to be fixed. We don't have to look and tinker and fiddle and do this and do that and going on the way to a goal. Because you'll never meet that kind of a goal, no matter what you do. What we could do is stop having goals. Get over it, right now. Stop thinking about the Holocaust. Stop thinking about all the injustice, because you're not going to fix justice, you're just not. I mean, look how many judges and police and courts and lawyers and prosecutors and defense lawyers and newspapers and all of that, are all trying to find justice, and what happens? They wind up being unjust with each other. And all of these bad feelings going around when everybody could just sit and enjoy each other. The prosecutors and the defense lawyers and the crooks and the cops and the judges could all just sit around and say, "Hey, everything's cool." But they don't. They're looking for justice. In fact, every criminal out there does every criminal act as revenge, trying to fix justice. And so, when we stop looking for getting justice and start recognizing that things are OK right now, injust as they are, that's all right. This is the teaching of Buddha: come out of the Dukkha of your own manufactured injustice. This is the story of Adam and Eve. They went around complaining about what was in Paradise, and because of that, it wasn't that they were thrown out of Paradise—that's a way of thinking about it. The better way of saying it is they destroyed their paradise. Kat, a while ago we were talking about the creek that's there at the Wat. It doesn't have much water in it. So why don't you take a bulldozer and fill that creek in with dirt instead? It's not a creek. It doesn't deserve to be called a creek. You see where I'm going with that? All right, let's not judge the creek because it doesn't have a lot of water in it. It just doesn't have water right now. That's okay. It's okay like it is.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure it will be like overflowing river soon when the rainy season hits harder, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what's that bulldozer going to do, and what all that dirt's going to do when the creek is all filled in when the water does come? You're a step ahead of me on that. Yeah, right. Then the whole water's going to get flooded because you didn't like it because the creek didn't have a lot of water in it. Then in fact, that's what we do in real time. We make things worse by trying to fix them. When I was— one of the jobs that I had when I was in college was repairing electronic equipment like amplifiers and tape recorders and all of that kind of stuff. And I remembered one time, they didn't keep this on the market for a long time because all the technicians had it. And that was that there was emitter-follower kind of a cathode. And if you put your probe on that transistor to check it out to see if it was working correctly, you would destroy it. If you put your probe on that transistor, it'll destroy the transistor. And so they stopped using those kind of transistors. But I remember that experience of that— my action of trying to do good, to try to fix that amplifier, to try to find out what was wrong with it, I made it worse. You go and fill in that creek. Turn your mic off, you're having an echo. Yeah, thanks. So filling up that creek because it's not got much water in it is a very dangerous thing to do. Anna. You thinking about the Holocaust is not fixing the Holocaust; it's over with already. But you're harming yourself when you think about the Holocaust and you don't like it. That's an unwholesome thought for you to think about injustice. And it would be a wholesome thought for you to think about, "Oh, I'm okay right now." I survived, I got along, I mean, here I am, I'm in New York now, and what happened in Germany 75 years ago is old news. Let's leave it. And yeah, there's injustice in New York, but the major part of the injustice is your thoughts about the injustice, because right now, The city of New York is not in the room with you. In the room with you, everything is as just as it could be. The only injustice in the room is in your own mind.

**Speaker D:** Okay, when injustice is in my room, what am I doing? I'm doing that I'm fine anyway.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're talking to me about things that are not just.

**Speaker D:** Okay, but if injustice sits in my room, somebody is suffering right now. So what should I do? To help this suffering.

**Speaker A:** The only person in the room that's suffering right now is you. And what you should do about it is to stop the suffering. Go ahead. Sorry, what?

**Speaker D:** Right now, yes. Right now I am absolutely happy seeing you in the seventh heaven. What's going to be if tomorrow I'm sitting with somebody with a sick dog?

**Speaker A:** They're not here now. No, no, that's right. Now, now, no, they're not here now. So your job is to get your mind in a really, really good, marvelous state, because those things are not happening right now. And if your mind is in a good, marvelous state when things do happen, you can keep your mind in a good, marvelous state. But if you are in an unmarvelous state right now because you're thinking about what could happen Now you're already in a bad state of mind, and so when something does happen, you're not in a good state of mind already. Let's go get ourselves into a good state of mind right now so that we can practice having the mind in a good state right now, and then when bad things happen according to your own rule system, you can say, "Hey, that's just an old rule. I'll throw that out." I'm still in a good state of mind. Even if you've got a teenage girl crying her eyes out with napkins and tears and Kleenex, and she's got so much trouble, the therapist needs to be in a good state of mind in order to help that girl get in a good state of mind. But the therapist, in fact most therapists, when the girl starts to cry, they'll start having compassion and pity party with her and commiserate with her and all of that. And then they're not being good therapists. A good therapist is going to have a good state of mind, no matter what the client brings. And you need to practice having that good state of mind. And what is that good state of mind? Everything's okay, everything is fine. Yeah, the girl is crying and we'll fix that, but I'm not going to go cry and have a pity party because she's crying and having a pity party. Yeah, she sees the injustice; I don't see the injustice. I just see a girl crying because she don't like something. If she'd stop that, she'd be in as good a state as I am. So the way to really help people is to bring them into the state of mind that the therapist is in. But the therapist has to be in a really good state of mind for it to be effective. And so you can stop with all your injustice and all the crying girls and everything that you think about and start thinking about, I'm okay, I survived, I'm all right, I'm still breathing, everything is okay. Or in my case, the butt's hurt, but I'll get it rest soon enough. As soon as this call is over, I'll go lay down and everything is going to be just fine. And so this is the attitude, this is why the Buddhism that the Buddha taught, the real Dharma, is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. See that Dukkha, see that you are complaining about things being unjust, and stop! Stop complaining about injustice and start enjoying that you can handle it. You can handle all of that injustice. That's the new rule: I can handle it, I can do this. I can sit here and not be afraid and uptight and angry because of all the injustice in the world. I can sit here and enjoy it. My dad had a phrase, one of the very best things I think that I ever got from him, was the little phrase that he says. And by the way, he was a laborer. He walked, he did pipe fitting, he was active, he was a muscle man, he was short and small, but he was strong. And what he said to me, and what he in fact said a lot of the time, he says, "Work? I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside it and go to sleep. I'm not afraid of work." Isn't that marvelous? Most people are afraid of work, they don't like to work. But my dad said, "Work? I'm not afraid of work. I'm not afraid of it at all. I can lay down and take a nap right beside the work." So, can you do that with injustice? Yeah, the world is unjust, but you're not afraid of the injustice? You can lay down beside it and take a nap, right beside all of that injustice. You can begin to have the attitude of, "I don't care." Stop caring about the injustice, because you're not going to be able to fix it, so why should you carry it around? This is what in the Pali is referred to as the Upadana of caring, carrying it around, grasping, clinging. Hanging on to, carrying it around. And the teaching of the Buddha is to let it go, drop it, relinquish. Atamayata. I'm not going to have anything to do with that Holocaust. Doesn't belong to me. I'm not going to have anything to do with the rats in New York. They don't belong to me. I'm not going to do anything about the traffic in New York. That's not my problem. So that's the attitude that we begin to have, is stop carrying stuff around. Atamayata— just drop it. That's why this whole teaching of the Buddha is not incremental. You don't have to take a little piece and throw it out, and then take another little piece and go and throw it out, and then go get another great big piece and put it on. No, we just take whatever's there and throw it all out. Just drop it, just relinquish it. I'm not going to have anything to do with that stuff. That's what the word ata mayata means. Ah means not, tam means do. I'm not going to do anything that is unwholesome, like thinking about justice and injustice. Not going to have anything to do with injustice. And then the end of the word ta is like an exclamation point. It's a point, ended. I'm just not going to have anything to do with it, period. That's that word tai in Pali, period. I'm not going to do it, period. So that's the attitude that you can develop. You're okay, Anna, you're already okay. Don't have anything to do with all the injustice of the world. Yeah, the world is unjust, but you're not going to be able to do anything about it. So just drop it. Don't care. Please don't care about the Holocaust. New York is full of people who make themselves miserable caring about the Holocaust. Israel is full of people making themselves miserable trying to fix the Holocaust. So just drop it! That's the whole point. The Buddhist teaching is not incremental, it's immediate. Drop the whole thing! Stop our judgments. Stop our business about thinking things are right and wrong, because almost always, the right and wrongs that we make is based upon feelings anyway, not upon direct observation and wisdom. The reality is, is that you can't fix the Holocaust. Is that true? Is it true that you cannot fix the Holocaust? Is it true you can't fix it? I want to hear an answer. I want to hear a yes, I cannot fix the Holocaust.

**Speaker D:** Well, of course I don't. I can't fix, but Okay, so you.

**Speaker A:** Cannot fix the Holocaust.

**Speaker D:** But so, so anyway, it's just this one, the part that you said I just can rest in between really good. So it's just this is the point. I don't want to argue right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, great.

**Speaker D:** I say something, but I want you.

**Speaker A:** To agree with me that you can't fix it. If you recognize that you can't fix the Holocaust, then why do you carry it around? There's a story in the suttas, Anagami, and she had a baby and the baby died. And she didn't like the fact that her baby died, and so she carried that corpse around, going to every doctor and every magic person that they could to get it fixed. And she carried that dead baby's corpse to the Buddha. And what the Buddha gave her, she got confused thinking that he was going to do magic. And he says, you go get an aniseed or a mustard seed from 10 houses that have never had any death. And she could not find even one house that would say, oh, you can have an aniseed here because we've never had anybody to die. The only houses that have nobody to die is the empty houses, because everybody already died, right? So that's for you also, is to recognize that a lot of people care about the Holocaust and nobody can fix it. And pretty soon, just like, uh, um, uh, Gatami you will stop carrying the dead corpse of injustice around. So whenever you think of something not being just, you can say, "Hey, I'm going to set that baby down, it's dead." And you can have some good happy thoughts instead. That rhymed.

**Speaker D:** I was listening story today about Vietnam veteran. It was just really emotional expression, not a story. And I get a pain in my stomach, so I was able to calm it down. That's what you mean by I just, I took myself out from the class.

**Speaker A:** And I was just— Right, you just didn't have to be there.

**Speaker D:** Stomach pain, is it? That's what you're saying, to feel comfortable? This is the thing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's, that's the two-step process, is that if you can handle it, you can just throw it out. If you can't handle it, like somebody having a discussion in a classroom or whatever, and you don't like what they're talking about and you can't deal with it, then the right thing to do is to get up and leave. If you've got somebody criticizing you and you know that you can handle it, you can stay there and have fun with them. At their expense, maybe. But if you don't like the criticism and you can't handle it, you can take a hike, you can go away. You can pick yourself up, dust yourself off, go to the bathroom, say, "I got an appointment." You can look at your watch and say, "Oh, look at the time," and just take off. So those are the two things that we can do. The problem is that if you stay, they may be able to get to you, but if you leave, they can't touch you. They can't touch you. And since you know now that you cannot fix an old dead problem, why carry it around? Stop carrying that dead corpse of injustice about the Holocaust, the injustice about the robbers, the injustice about crooks and all of that kind of stuff, because everybody makes themselves miserable looking to set things right. We're all looking for revenge, and we all wind up in misery. And when we stop looking for revenge and start recognizing everything's just fine just like it is, no need to get even, everything's all right. Everything's okay right now. Drop it all. Yeah, we'll pick it up later, but when we see that, we'll say, yeah, I'll drop it again, throw it down. So anytime you catch yourself thinking about the Holocaust, you say, "That's over. I don't have to carry that one anymore. I can set it down. I can be happy even though the Holocaust happened." That makes it easy. Life's going to be really easy for you when you stop carrying around all these dead babies. Everything is already okay. The only problem with the world is people want to fix it. They don't like it the way that it is. They want to take revenge. They want to fix things. And you, you could just be happy. Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry about the Holocaust, be happy. Don't worry about injustice, just be happy. Don't worry about the rats in New York, just be happy. Can you do that? I bet you can if you remember. That's what basically, back to the original teaching of the Buddha, is all about— the Eight Noble Path is you got to remember to take a look at the fact that you're having thoughts that are not wholesome, and then change them. Change those unwholesome thoughts about the Holocaust and Anicca and Arhat into, "I survived, here I am, didn't catch me, Holocaust can't touch me." And pretty soon you get the idea, can't nothing touch you, can't nothing get to you. So this is the way that we practice, is you can't touch it, can't get me. I can drop that thought and I'm okay. So, Cat, you're showing us a lot of animal pictures and kneecaps. What you thinking about? Anna, do you have any comments?

**Speaker D:** I think enough for today.

**Speaker A:** Enough for today.

**Speaker D:** I think it's enough. Yes, it's enough.

**Speaker A:** Good. All right. Well, I'm really glad to see you both, and thanks, Kat, for all of those images from your cell phone.

**Speaker D:** That's so beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Marvelous watch you've got there. And, uh, Kat, can you hear me? I guess he's not listening. Oh, finally you come back. Hello. Did you turn your mic on? I guess not. I guess he's really not listening. All right, Anna, enough for today. Cat, your mic is not on. Gosheya.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends Corey (C), Anna (D), and Kat (B), centers on a core, radical principle of the Buddha's teaching: **the immediate end of suffering through changing one's thoughts in the present moment, as opposed to an incremental, goal-oriented approach.**

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and teachings:

### **Core Teaching: Immediate vs. Incremental**
*   **Incrementalism:** Our societal conditioning teaches us to see progress as a slow, step-by-step journey toward a future goal (e.g., enlightenment, a fixed life). This leads to constant dissatisfaction, always looking to the horizon for fulfillment.
*   **The Buddha's Immediate Path:** The true Dhamma is about **ending *dukkha* (suffering/stress) right now**. The Buddha taught "Dukkha and the cessation of Dukkha." When you practice correctly, the fruit is immediate. You don't slowly fix your life; you change your mind *in this moment*.

### **The Mechanism: The Mind is the Forerunner**
*   **Thought Precedes Everything:** Society focuses on actions, but the Buddha teaches that **the mind is the forerunner of all states**. Unwholesome actions (anger, fear, desire) spring from unwholesome thoughts. Therefore, the battlefield is the thought itself.
*   **Example of Anger:** A cup breaks. Anger seems instantaneous, but it's preceded by a micro-thought based on a *saṅkhāra* (mental formation/rule) like "cups shouldn't break" or "I've lost something irreplaceable." This thought is rooted in **fear of loss**. By changing the underlying thought ("It's just a cup," "I can handle this"), anger doesn't arise.

### **Practical Application: Changing Your Thoughts**
*   **Unwholesome to Wholesome:** The practice is to vigilantly notice unwholesome thoughts (worry, resentment, self-pity, desire for things to be different) and **immediately replace them with wholesome ones**.
    *   Instead of "I have so far to go," think "I can do this right now."
    *   Instead of "This project is overwhelming," think "This aspect is easy; I can handle it."
    *   Instead of "I'm sick and miserable," think "This is an opportunity to practice; right now, I am breathing and okay."
*   **The "Everything is Okay" Meditation:** Repeatedly bring the mind back to the truth that **in this present physical reality, you are safe and okay**. The suffering exists only in the mind's travel to the past (Holocaust, old criticisms) or future (work, potential problems). "Right here, right now, there are no rats from New York, no traffic, no one criticizing you in this room."

### **Addressing Challenges (with Anna)**
*   **Injustice and Suffering of Others:** Anna's persistent challenge is how to reconcile this teaching with the world's great injustices (Holocaust, torture). Dhammarato's consistent response:
    1.  **You Cannot Fix the Past:** Carrying the mental burden of past injustices is like carrying a dead baby's corpse (referencing the story of Kisā Gotamī). It only harms you and doesn't help.
    2.  **It's a Thought, Not Current Reality:** That injustice is not happening in your present sensory reality. By obsessing over it, you inject suffering into your *now*.
    3.  **Effective Help Requires a Stable Mind:** To truly help someone who is suffering, you must first have a mind that is unshaken, peaceful, and sees "everything is okay." Only from that stable place can you effectively lead others out of their misery. A therapist who joins a client in their pity party is of no help.

### **Wisdom vs. Desire/Revenge**
*   **Desire as Revenge:** Much of our desire is a form of "revenge"—an attempt to fix a perceived lack or wrong to make ourselves feel better. "I'll feel better if I get what I want" is seeking revenge on the state of not-having.
*   **Wisdom is Observation:** Wisdom means **seeing things as they are**, without the filter of "I like this" or "I don't like this." It is pure observation, free from the compulsive rule-making that says reality *should* be different. It is like a baseball player focused only on the ball's trajectory, not on a distracting argument.

### **Key Takeaways & Phrases**
*   **"Everything is okay right now."** The central mantra for cutting through incremental worry.
*   **"The mind is the forerunner."** Take responsibility for your thoughts, as they create your reality.
*   **"Stop carrying the corpse."** Relinquish (*ādāna*) past burdens and judgments.
*   **"Don't care."** In the sense of "don't carry the burden" of things you cannot change and that are not present.
*   **Practice is not about slowly becoming peaceful; it's about **choosing peace this very moment** by changing your thought.**

The talk is a forceful reminder that the path is about **release, not attainment**. Happiness is not a distant goal; it is the default state when we stop filling the present moment with unwholesome thoughts about the past and future.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly the contrast between incremental progress and immediate mental change. Here are the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Driving a Car:** This is the most extended metaphor.
    *   **The Car:** Your life or your mind.
    *   **Staying in the Lane & Maintaining Speed:** Maintaining wholesome thoughts and a steady, mindful state.
    *   **Autopilot:** The unconscious, habitual way of living based on past conditioning (samskara).
    *   **The Danger:** If you don't "watch the road" (pay attention to your mind), you will drift into unwholesome states (anger, fear) and "have an accident" (suffer, create dukkha).

2.  **The Cup Breaking:** A central example used to dissect the process of anger.
    *   **The Event:** A cup falls and breaks.
    *   **The Unwholesome Sequence:** The pre-existing rule ("cups shouldn't break") + the perception of the event -> thought ("oh no!") -> fear of loss -> anger.
    *   **The Wholesome Alternative:** A different pre-existing mindset ("these cups are old, let's have fun") -> the same event -> a different perception -> enjoyment or indifference.
    *   **The Point:** Anger isn't thoughtless; it's preceded by lightning-fast thoughts and judgments. We can change the foundational thoughts.

3.  **Zen Archer / Baseball Player:** Used to illustrate the skill of mindfulness and the danger of distraction.
    *   **The Skill:** A Zen archer on a rocking horse or a baseball catcher tracking a 100 mph ball exemplifies a trained, focused mind that stays with the object (the ball, the breath) without being pulled away by rules or stories.
    *   **The Distraction:** If the baseball player thinks about a fight with his wife *instead of* the ball's trajectory, he will miss the catch. Similarly, if we get lost in thoughts about injustice or work, we miss the reality of the present moment.

4.  **Filling the Dry Creek:** A metaphor for the folly of trying to "fix" reality based on dislike.
    *   **The Scene:** A creek that is dry because the rainy season hasn't started.
    *   **The Foolish Fix:** Using a bulldozer to fill it in because "it's not a proper creek."
    *   **The Consequence:** When the rains come, the water will flood because you destroyed its natural channel.
    *   **The Point:** Our judgments and attempts to fix what we don't like (e.g., ruminating on past injustice) often make things worse. It's better to accept the current reality ("the creek is dry right now, that's okay").

5.  **Carrying the Dead Baby (The Story of Kisagotami):** A direct reference to a famous Buddhist story.
    *   **The Story:** A woman (Kisagotami) whose baby dies carries the corpse everywhere, seeking a cure. The Buddha asks her to fetch a mustard seed from a home that has never known death. She cannot find one, thus realizing death is universal.
    *   **The Application:** Speaker A tells Anna she is like Kisagotami, carrying the "dead corpse" of the Holocaust or other injustices. Since she cannot fix it, carrying it only causes her suffering. The wise action is to "set the baby down."

### **Other Key Analogies and References:**

*   **Incrementalism vs. Immediate Change:** This is the central conceptual framework. Incrementalism is portrayed as our cultural habit of seeing progress as a slow, linear path (like a big project). The Buddha's teaching is contrasted as **immediate**: changing a single thought *right now* from unwholesome to wholesome is the entire practice.
*   **Robbery Planning:** Used to illustrate the Buddha's teaching that "the mind is the forerunner." The law punishes the action (robbing the bank) or preparation (casing the bank), but the Buddha points to the originating *thought* as the root.
*   **Adam and Eve:** Referenced to illustrate how "judging" (the knowledge of good and evil) is what destroys our personal paradise (peace of mind). By constantly judging reality as unjust or not good enough, we create our own suffering.
*   **Therapist and Crying Girl:** Illustrates that to truly help others, one must first maintain one's own wholesome, stable state of mind. If the therapist gets sucked into the client's "pity party," they are of no help.
*   **Work? I can sleep beside it:** The story of the speaker's father reframing "work" not as something to fear or resent, but as something he is "not afraid of." This models the attitude to cultivate toward all of life's challenges, including injustice.

### **Summary of Rhetorical Purpose:**
The metaphors and stories are not decorative. They serve a clear pedagogical purpose:
*   **To Make Abstract Concepts Tangible:** Mind training is compared to the physical skills of driving, archery, and baseball.
*   **To Deconstruct Mental Processes:** The breaking cup dissects the micro-moments where suffering arises.
*   **To Challenge Deep-Seated Worldviews:** The dry creek and dead baby stories powerfully challenge the instinct to cling to and "fix" past suffering and injustice.
*   **To Advocate for a Radical Shift:** The contrast between incrementalism and immediate change, supported by all the other examples, argues for a total reorientation from fixing the external world to taking radical responsibility for one's internal state *in the present moment*.
