### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Robert's getting something to drink, and I'll basically introduce the topic while he's gone. It's an article that was written by someone who had some sort of brain damage, and that started with the article about electroshock therapy, because they're still doing that. I mean, I would have thought that after the movie went through over the cuckoo's nest back in the 1960s, that they would have stopped such stuff. But according to the research, it looks like that about 120,000 people a year are still in electroshock therapy in the United States, because that seems to be a treatment for depression.

**Speaker B:** Holy moly.

**Speaker A:** And the question that the article is talking about is that in this electroshock therapy, as well as some sort of blunt force injuries and other things like this has to do with a loss of memory. There's an old word called amnesia that when people forget stuff, and when they've forgotten like everything and have no memories of stuff, that brings in a lot of confusion and doubt because now we don't know anything. And so the question that this guy had was with the electroshock therapy Does it present the issue of either I have no memory and I've lost all the memory, but I can be happy, versus I'm going to be miserable and depressed, but at least I can remember what happened? Okay, this seems to be then a lose-lose situation in all regards. Is that you have to give up your memories in order to be happy. But guess what? Those people who go through that, that have electroshock therapy, that it may get them out of their depression, but it doesn't make them happy. But in fact, now they're unhappy because they can't remember why they were unhappy. They're unhappy because they can't remember why they were unhappy. But the habit of being unhappy is still there, and so the question is, aren't some memories valuable, useful, and wholesome? The answer to that is absolutely. But that doesn't mean that all memories are valuable, useful, and wholesome. Some memories are in fact quite detrimental. For instance, if once an hour, every hour, you thought about your brother slapping you in the face when you were both 15, that's not going to be a particularly helpful memory to have whenever you're dealing with your brother. It's better to forget all about a whole bunch of stuff. And this is what the Buddha is talking about, is that the memories that come up while we're sitting practicing being happy, we can forget about all the stuff that made us unhappy. But that doesn't mean that we're going to forget everything. And also what we're really talking about here is to have the emotional unloading in the sense that we can use the memory as like a vehicle, but we don't have to have that vehicle loaded down with the garbage of all the bad feelings that occurred when that incident happened.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so there's— yes, question slash— so could you then have skillful remembering and unskillful remembering?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. That's what we're going into right now.

**Speaker D:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, the electroshock therapy actually erases— or let us say, not erases, but clouds up— things that are useful to remember. And the funny thing is, is that even when people have amnesia, they don't forget their English language, they don't forget how to walk, They don't forget, uh, all kinds of things, but names and faces and other kinds of stuff like that they don't remember. And so what we can think of it like this is everybody's got a closet, and in the back of the closet is old stuff that you never pull out of the closet or look at. Now imagine that a lot of old stuff gets put into the closet like a memory bank, and you keep putting stuff in and putting stuff in and putting stuff in, and it's not ever organized. That means that when you go to look for something, more than likely you're going to find something else in the way.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so let us say that we're looking for something blue, but we keep seeing all of these things that are almost blue but not blue, and some of them are sharp objects. And so we go to try to get the things out of the way so we can see what we want, and we get stabbed or stuck with something else. This is what we mean by free association, that the mind just kind of wanders around. And so that what we're going through is now a training, which is also another way of saying that we're going to organize our closet. We're going to go in there and inspect things and clean things out and throw a bunch of stuff out that we don't need anymore. And having an organized closet is a power, that's a skill. Now, the way to introduce this next topic is to talk about a particular sutta, and that sutta is number 12, "The Lion's Roar." And in there, the Buddha Basically, it's a good idea to talk about the sutta in general. What happened is that Sariputta came back from alms round and told the Buddha that he had seen a monk who had been a monk, a Bhikkhu, who had disrobed, and now he was in the village complaining about the Buddha having no superhuman talents, no superhuman skills. What Sariputta repeats is that what he does say is the Buddha only teaches suffering and the end of suffering, and he teaches that well, and people are getting it. But the guy's still angry at the Buddha because the Buddha didn't teach him what he wanted to know, which was about magical powers. And the Buddha's answer to that is in several stages, and one of them is 3 items that the Buddha asks the question is, how can they possibly come up with these kinds of beliefs from the teachings that we give? In other words, if we're giving the teachings of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path and such like that, then how can people gain that this is going to allow the monk to fly through the air with the greatest of ease without trapeze. This is a great question. Exactly. And so the first one was, uh, how can people possibly get this from the teachings of, uh, the Buddha? And that is the, the one that is so famous that I had to— I didn't have to, I just kind of memorized it because I heard it so much and sing along. And that is that The Buddha says about that phrase that is so common, is how can people get that out of my teachings?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the second one he has is that how can people actually get out of the teachings flying through the air, diving into the dirt, swimming around, walking on water, walking through walls, and that kind of stuff? How can they possibly get those ideas from the actual teachings of the Buddha? Because this is what this guy was in the first part of the sutra was complaining about, that the Buddha didn't teach that stuff. He only taught Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. He didn't teach magic. And then the third one, how could the people who understand the teachings of the Buddha actually see that the Buddha can surround another person's mind with his mind, encompass it, and know what someone is thinking? Now, actually, Ajahn Po made a big point about this particular one, was telling me several times, you do not know what is in the mind of another. All you can do is see their behavior. And people are incongruent, which means that they'll have one thing on their mind and give you behavior somewhere else. An example of that is someone telling a lie, that liars actually will demonstrate that incongruity. An example of that is making a statement and then trying to get everybody who's listening to you to agree by using gestures and mannerisms. Okay, this one is one of the favorite ones that people use. Watch my face very closely. I just lied to you. Leaning forward, nodding your head, trying to get everybody to go along. In other words, if I can get you to nod your head, that means that you're buying my bullshit. Another one is when we look over to someone else to get their approval, like Donald Trump. Will make a deliberate lie and then he'll look over to someone else or someone down in the audience to at least get them to agree with him. Okay, so the point is that the Buddha is saying that you do not know what's in the mind of a person, but you can see their behavior. And then the Buddha gives this definition that is the lion's roar, and that is what are the powers of a Buddha. And the first item on the list, which is— and always when we think of it like this, the most important thing is always done first. Oh, quick things that we most remember are the things that are either spectacular or the last thing that was said. Go ahead, go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Um, so the second one was the— okay, so the second thing was the powers. And the third thing was reading my— but what was the first thing again? That

**Speaker A:** the Buddha is actually— the word is that he is a charioteer or a driver of gods and men. Deva Manusana. Okay, that he is actually— and it's translated as he's a trainer of gods and men. But in the sutta, the word is driver, like a charioteer. He doesn't train the horses. The charioteer doesn't train horses. He drives them after somebody else has trained them. Okay, and so that means that they're giving extra power that should not be there. And so in the English, they've wrongly translated it from driver into a trainer. But the point is, that's the first one, that if it is so, Bhagavan, Arahant, Samma Sanghappa, okay, while that stuff may be true, it is— and here's an example, the Lokavidu means the knower of the world. And that that can be seen, and in fact it's actually stated in the Visuddhimagga that that means that he knows every shark and every fish and every plankton. He's a knower of the world, he knows all about the world, and that's ridiculous. No one knows the world that well. All we need to know is enough about it to know, is this Dukkha or not? That's the only question, not everything. But we only get one thing at a time, one by one as they occur. Is this Dukkha or is this not Dukkha? And a knower of the world is a little bit higher than that. So what we mean by that in an ordinary but practical, noble sense would be that we know of the world what presents itself to us now, as to whether that is Dukkha or not. But the way that it's stated in the thing is the knower of the world which is giving him far more power than is there in reality, the same way as encompassing his mind

**Speaker C:** or

**Speaker A:** encompassing another person's mind with his mind. Can you know what somebody is thinking?

**Speaker C:** Got it. So these are the things Could you repeat what the loca— these are the things the Buddha cannot do.

**Speaker A:** Loca vidu means the knower of the world, just like Dhamma vidu is knower of the Dhamma. My good friend over on, uh, Koh Samui. Okay, and you can see the word vidu is the same word as video. This is an Indo-European language.

**Speaker C:** I remember when I was at Swan Mook, I would talk about films and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? About watching— I was saying, I remember

**Speaker C:** when I was at Swan Mook, I remember Dhamma Vido and his Dharma talks. He would talk about films sometimes.

**Speaker A:** He would talk about what sometimes?

**Speaker C:** Film. Like movies? I'm missing— hear me?

**Speaker D:** Film.

**Speaker C:** Film.

**Speaker D:** Movies.

**Speaker C:** Like movies?

**Speaker A:** Oh, films. Okay, right, I got it. Okay.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** What would Anagami have to say about films?

**Speaker C:** It was a long time ago, but I remember he talked about like going to the movie theater as a kid, and he also talked about this movie that he saw like about this big creature in the abyss. I forget the name, like Stranger, like Alien from Another Galaxy or something like that, or Stranger from Another World. And he talked about that one of his talks. It was really interesting, and I still remember it all these years later.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, do you know what I'm talking about?

**Speaker A:** No, uh, I, I know there's a, uh, a movie called The Abyss that came out about 1990 or something like that, and that— and he became a monk in 1993, so he may have been talking about that, you used the word abyss, but I don't know what the story is that you're talking about.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, I think it was this, this movie about this alien that was like a black mass of goo, um, or something along those lines. And it was— oh, I've got one

**Speaker A:** of those in the yard here someplace.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And, and I think he talked about how like he had like a spiritual experience where he saw something like that And that was like kind of what opened him up to spirituality. I believe that was what the talk was about. If I remember correctly.

**Speaker A:** I want to start showing that Bhikkhu to my friends when they come over. Okay. I don't know.

**Speaker C:** I don't know. I don't know. Remembering it, but that was a while ago. That was what I remembered. So, um, yeah, anyway, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** No, he— but he's a really great historian. Many of the details that I've gotten about the deep dark ancient past, especially what India was like before the time of Buddha, I've gotten from him. He's quite a scholar like that. But I'm also a bit of a scholar too, and in that, uh, respect. Anyway, back to— actually, there is a

**Speaker C:** YouTube series of Dhamma Vidu in Hong Kong. I can drop it in the Sangha chat.

**Speaker A:** I've got that. Yes, I know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that would be fun for people. But anyway, you should have him on as a guest or something at some point.

**Speaker A:** That would be great. That would not be possible.

**Speaker C:** Oh, that's too bad, because where he

**Speaker A:** lives there is no internet, there is no Wi-Fi, there is no cell tower. They live on a mountain that is remote enough, on an outlying island that's remote enough.

**Speaker B:** Sounds great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, in fact, I know of one monk in particular who left Dom Khyentse because he had no internet connection. That he has to go walk about just to get his cell phone so that he can get close enough over the edge so that he can have the cell phone being seen from the tower on the road somewhere below.

**Speaker C:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And so it's very spotty. You cannot get good connections in general anywhere around there. You have to leave and go down the hill and and things like that. So anyway, let's go back.

**Speaker D:** I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning anymore, but back to that topic of knowing the world. Eric shared something with me that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said. I don't know the actual full context of it, but it was something like he said something like, I would be afraid to see some of these great wonders of the world, like the Grand Canyon. Because all I would see is idyapapachayata.

**Speaker A:** Right, just see the cause and effect. In other words, we just recognize, oh, I see how this thing was built. I mean, this was water, and now let's go home. Yeah, yeah, okay.

**Speaker C:** That's like what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** That has a whole lot to do with been there, done that. That, in fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa spent quite a lot of time in India. It's quite common for the time monks to go on pilgrimage to India. And so that was the one monk in the spiritual theater. There's literally hundreds of photographs from back in the 1930s when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was in India. So now that he's been to India and seen Kishnagar and Lumpini— well, I don't think he had Lumpini, but Bodhgaya and Isitanya and Varanasi and all of the sites. What's the Grand Canyon here and there? Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I mean, Eric and I were talking about, uh, how we're starting to see some of that too. Like, we kind of pointed out how in this forest it just seems like you'll see a particular fern and a particular tree together and a particular type of, you know, surrounding environment, and you can kind of see the cause and effect playing out. As to why things are the way that they are.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Which is, let's get back then to the sutta and then back to memory, because this fits right in. Okay, so after the Buddha talks about the things that— how could people possibly believe this kind of stuff based upon the actual teachings of the Buddha— he then talks about things that are a factor of the path. And there are 10 items on that list. The first item on the list is always the most important one, and so this is something to really understand in this regard, and that is that the first knowledge or the first power of the Buddha is he knows the difference between what's possible and what's not possible. Okay, it is not possible for you to jump into the dirt and swim around and come back up to the surface and then walk on the surface again. I mean, if you fall in one time, won't you fall in with every step you take? How can you get out of the ground? It's like water. Once you're in the water, how can you stand up on top of the water? The next thing is, how can you possibly not need a bath after you're swimming in the dirt. And so this is what we mean then. This is an important or powerful thing, is to come to understand the things that are possible and the things that are not possible. Because if we cling to the impossible, we will always be unhappy and dissatisfied because we don't get what we want, because we don't recognize that it's actually not available to us. So some things are impossible for one person and possible for another, because one person has developed the skills that makes it possible, and other people don't have the skills. Other things are just flat-out impossible for everyone. And so, knowing what is possible and not possible is a major part of the spiritual awakening is when we give up magical beliefs and we give up things that we've heard about that we don't actually have any experience of. It's always hearsay. So this actually goes back to then the Kalama Sutta in the Anguttara Nikaya, in the threes, where the Buddha talks about don't take things because of tradition or because of hearsay or because of common knowledge or because you heard it from someone you trust, or because it's written in a book, or anything like that. You have to do your own investigation. And he even mentions confirmation bias in there, but it's not confirmation bias in the language that we use, but it's rather that just because you believed it already, that it confirms what you believe already, still that's no reason to believe it. The only reason for you to accept something is because you've evaluated it through deep inspection. OK? That comes from— on another point about that, is in Christianity, when they're arguing with atheists and whatnot like that, they come with the phrase of lack of evidence is not evidence of absence. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This is the Christian trip. In other words, just because you can't see it doesn't make that it's not true. The answer, though, is, is that once you do an absolute thorough investigation— let's say that you're looking for a wristwatch and it was the last time, place you saw it, it was in the room— and you go so far as to take every little item out of that room and completely inspect it, completely. Anything that's the size of that wristwatch has been evaluated and searched and placed aside, taken out of the room, and now what's left is emptiness, and there's no watch there. You can assume that the watch was not there. That's evidence of absence, is absence of evidence. This is all back to Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes can see what's going on because he knows not just with his spyglass what he does see, but he also recognizes things that have been removed from the room or other things that are missing. And that's also evidence. Okay, so this is what we mean then by with a correct evaluation and examination, we can see what's possible and not possible. It was not possible for that wristwatch to have been lost in that room. It's not in that room. It's not possible. Why? Because we've done a complete, thorough investigation and the watch is not there. And we can do that same sort of thing with a god or a ghost. They're not there. Then in fact, um, on the, um, there was the educational channel and the History Channel on television, on cable channels. And both of them together would have programs where people would go to every haunted house and every haunted building that they could locate in and outside the United States, setting up all kinds of equipment, electromagnetic equipment, sound equipment, cameras, all kinds of stuff, and leave it there recording, trying to trap a ghost. And they went, um, one series or one episode after another with spooky music, dark stuff, all kinds of possibilities. And at the end of every film, they would say, well, we didn't find anything here, but stay tuned for next week. That is a thorough examination. They went out ghost hunting and they made sure that they could not find one, because they did. I mean, they made sure by looking carefully that there were no ghosts to be found. But still, things go bump in the night. But here's an example then of after a thorough investigation, you can see what's possible and not possible. Ghosts are not possible, because they have done all of the evaluations that they could. The same thing is true then with the Catholic Church. For 2,000 years, and really for more than— strongly for 1,000 years since the monks became, or the priests became celibate, that with hundreds of thousands of priests over time, the Catholic Church Church is really, really strapped for finding actual miracles and actual saints. They haven't canonized one person in 10 years or 20 years or so other than Mother Teresa, and it's a pretty good point that she really didn't deserve that canonization. They just needed to canonize somebody, and so they have things like Lourdes, and there's been quite a lot of research with Lourdes. Um, Eric, is that you calling?

**Speaker D:** Yes, Eric's calling in.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, so now you've got the other

**Speaker D:** No.

**Speaker A:** So that's enough to understand right from the very beginning that, uh, that a major point about an enlightened one, or one who is awake, is they know the difference between what's possible and not possible. The second teaching of the Buddha in

**Speaker D:** this list— I wanted to mention that, uh, I feel like— I don't know, that resonated with me a little bit. With our last discussion, because all we talked about was yesterday was just get comfortable. I was like, that's simple enough, that's possible. It's nothing really that special. It's like, get comfortable. And boy, did it work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, getting comfortable is possible. Exactly right, it is possible. It really is possible. And I know a lot of people who think that it's impossible to get comfortable. Yeah, okay. So the next— I thank you for that. That's, that's excellent, right? To know what is possible rather than— because we spend a lot of time on recognizing what's not possible, but many things that are considered not possible are in fact possible. Getting comfortable is possible.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** The next item on the list then is about Kamma. But the Kamma that the Buddha talks about, that you can see the causality or the conditioning. In other words, this causes that. But if you have this happen and then later that happen, if there is no causal connection between the two, that means that they're just synchronicity. There is no causal connection between the two. So an example of that in Thailand and in India, especially when someone was a destitute or broken or anything like that, then everybody around would say, "Oh, that's just his Kamma, he must have been a real jerk in his past life." They do not have that causal connection. There's no connection between a past life and the current life. There's no store and forward mechanism, that you actually have to see a causal connection. What the Buddha didn't know was the inverse square law, which means that things rot much faster than we think that they do. An inverse square has to do with time and distance, and if you move twice the distance, that means that you only get a quarter of the power. And so the more time that something takes, the less likely it's actually going to be an influence on the situation. A really interesting way of talking about that is that the nation of Israel was created by Hitler. How did Hitler create Israel? Well, he had Auschwitz, he did a lot of damage, he killed a lot of people, and in response to that, the British government set up the nation of Israel, kind of as a consolation prize for for what Hitler had done. Now, that kind of thinking is ridiculous because Hitler didn't have anything to do with the formation of Israel. Then in fact, it could have been formed without even having the Holocaust. There would have been a whole lot more people in Israel. So we don't know that kind of stuff. But that's one of the— I mean, if you're wanting to apologize for or have an apology for Hitler, then saying, well, he created Israel, is one of the really ridiculous things that you can say, but there's no cause and effect there. It was too long, it took too many years. He was dead in 1945, and the nation of Israel didn't even happen until what, '48, '49, something like that, and it still wasn't even a nation then. And so we have to understand that Kamma operates with a cause and effect. That is not magical. But then the point that I hope that Robert is listening, because we're coming around to the, the point that is here.

**Speaker C:** Uh, Robert, Robert is listening. Robert is listening.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, um, the next point is the one that is taken magically. That is translated magically. It's in the suttas in the English language, it's talked about magically, even though the first part of the sutra has already disavowed all the magic. But yet this item is there, and that is that the Buddha can see into the past. He can see who he was with this name and this family and this situation past life after past life after past life after past life. That's the magical way of talking about it. But basically what the Buddha is actually saying is that once you clean your closet, once you clean the mind out, then your memory systems, your reorganization is superb, so that you actually do have a very, very good memory. Now, that can actually be tested out, in the sense that psychologists have the view that someone who grows up, and our childhoods are normally so traumatic that we don't remember much of anything, we kind of push it away. We don't get it. And so a lot of people don't remember anything happened before the age of 6. And that's especially true if we live in the same house, the same town, the safe environment from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 up to 10, 11, 12, 13. And then we don't have any usefulness of memory markers like I remember that happened at this time because I lived in that house at that time. But if I lived in the same house for many, many years, then it's hard to remember the environment as an example of when something happened. But generally, the idea is that people don't remember much happened before they were 6 years old, and we also don't remember a whole lot. But one of the things that is part of TA, and then later the part of the practice of the Buddha, is by cleaning the mind out, means that you begin to no longer associate the actual memories, the visual, auditory, the sensation memory, with the kinesthetic or the feeling memory that we associate with it, that these almost always are connected together, how we felt about a situation and that situation are intimately tied together. And because of that, people don't remember a whole lot of stuff because they don't want to bring up the tragedies of those memories. But when the mind is cleaned out, that's going back with the closet analogy. Once you clean out the closet, you know where everything is. You organize it, you put it back, you may get shelves or hangers or all kinds of stuff. And things are not just piled in a great big pile in there the way that they are in the mind, that we begin to organize things, which means that now we can remember things very, very clearly. And so it's actually worthwhile to muse, to sit there with a strong, still, quiet, functioning, happy mind to go back and recall and recollect stuff that happened. Do you remember your 4th birthday party, if you had a party? What was the presents that you got for the 4th birthday? What house did you live in? What your bedroom look like? Go and start asking those questions and do that evaluation, and you'll recognize that there is an entire huge amount of memory that you just were not— at one time it was impossible for you to bring that stuff up, but with the proper training you can remember almost everything that happened. But you actually— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** You're actually encouraging digging back in the past while we're in a good state and, and seeing and kind of seeing it from a different point of view, right?

**Speaker A:** A recollection that this stuff is not just randomly popping up to bite us in the butt, but rather that we're actually investigating.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker A:** Okay, investigating the mind and bringing this stuff up so that a Buddha can remember what names he was called, the locations, the people who were around him, and all kinds of stuff. Now, there was something very interesting that happened with me. My dad had— he was a very interesting character, and I don't really give him a lot of credit or talk about him very much. But one of the things that's important to start off with is that he was actually a half-breed. He was half Native American and half white man. His dad was white, his mother was Indian. And when I was a little kid, he would take me to all kinds of Indian things. We We went to the rodeo, not for the rodeo, but for the halftime performance that the Indians would do because they would come out in all their regalia and do their war dancing or the rain dancing and things like this. This was in Oklahoma in the '50s. And so it was very much a part of the community as well as when my grandfather died, when we cleaned the house out, I was able to take home with me a huge amount of Native American paraphernalia, including bones that were stripped, you know, bone vests, that kind of stuff, and arrows and an old bow and all kinds of stuff that I was able to get. But we're talking about stuff now, a huge amount of memories that I have that happened when I was 6 years old. Wow, because he died when I was 6. My grandfather died when I was 6 years old, and we moved out of Shawnee, Oklahoma when I was 7. So starting with at the age of 8, all of my memories are in South Carolina. But for the, uh, but I remember so much happening that happened before I was age of 6. So when I heard the psychologist say that most people don't remember very much, well, I remember a huge amount. I remember almost everything. In fact, I could almost give you a blow-by-blow of what happened. It would take me 6 years to tell you all that happened in my first 6 years. Wow.

**Speaker C:** Wow. I have a question on that. How do you know that these are true memories versus, you know, like maybe you— like I remember one time in another of your talks you mentioned how you remembered this particular tree being planted in a particular place.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** Right. So how do you distinguish between the real memories and the fake ones?

**Speaker A:** Well, uh, generally even that memory was still a memory of the tree. It was just a different tree that my grandfather had planted. So it wasn't that wrong of a memory. It was just that it wasn't this particular pecan tree that he planted. He— I was there when he planted a different tree, but it was in the same yard. Okay. And the tree that he planted didn't exist anymore. And so what I remembered was this tree exists. It must have been this tree. So that was That was the kind of mistake. But talking about it in that regard, all of that happened when I was about 3 years old when we visited North Carolina, because my mom went home and we rode the train. And I remember that train ride a lot. I also remember my grandfather's chicken coop. I remember helping him pull feathers out of a chicken and then using a paper bag to set the skin on fire. To help clean the rest of that chicken. I mean, I remember so much stuff.

**Speaker C:** I remember my mom.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And I remember what you were thinking back then.

**Speaker A:** No, I was so— I was too young, but I do remember just so much stuff. Now, back to my dad. Part of the reason for that was because I remember him telling me something. There was a time when there was a they were paving the street that we lived on there in Shawnee. And my dad says that he remembers a steamroller paving the street that he lived on, and it was the first street that was paved in Shawnee. And he said he was only 18 months old when that happened. So we're talking about 1908, 1909, they paved the road in Shawnee. And he remembers that. And so because he told me that, he gave me permission at that point in time to remember everything that happened. Now, I don't remember— now then, fast forward for many years, I'm not paying any attention, I'm not thinking about it, this is not part of it. And so I kind of forgot because I just wasn't recollecting. But when we look at this part about the Buddha remembering everything this happened, all of those events. Yeah, I can come up with 100,000, easily 100,000 different events that happened when I was a kid. I remember exactly my 4th birthday that I got a doll. It was a Howdy Doody doll. You know Howdy Doody? Howdy Doody was a children's program on television. It was sort of like the Disney, uh, thing. But, uh, Howdy Doody was a puppet, and he had, uh, there was Clarabelle the Clown and Phineas T. Bluster, who was the mayor of the town and all of that. But Howdy Doody was the star of this puppet show for kids on television in, uh, early 1950s. And so when I was 4 years old, my mommy gave me a, a doll, a Howdy Doody doll, doll, and I hated it. I hated it because I was a boy and boys don't play with dolls. But on my 5th birthday, I got a bicycle, but it was a very special bicycle. It was a Long Ranger bicycle.

**Speaker D:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And it had black tassels coming out the sides of the handlebars, and it had a little scabbard with a toy gun in it. The back bicycle was completely black. I remember that. I got that on my 5th birthday, and I remember that bicycle really, really clearly. So all of this kind of stuff— I remember when I was, uh, in that time that we had a piano that was an old, old, old piano, and that I would take the, uh, the ivory and, and peel the ivory strips off the top of the keys so that they weren't white and black anymore. And things like this. I mean, there's just so much. Like I said, I can go on and on, but this is the part

**Speaker C:** that has— I found a Howdy Doody doll. Please tell— I'm going to drop it in the chat. I'd love to hear if this is the doll that you had.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, what happened with that doll was the body rotted off, but we kept the head of it.

**Speaker D:** That's it.

**Speaker C:** That's it. Yeah, it's kind of a creepy doll. I see why you didn't like it, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, especially with the jaw.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** So getting then back to the quality of the question of memory, is it somehow or another the human mind stores things according to how we feel rather than according to chronological events.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And when we unhook the memories from the feelings that went along with these memories, we can remember so many things that come up that we couldn't have known before, that we've forgotten. And the reason that we forget it is because it's emotionally loaded. It's loaded down with stuff, and so we prefer not to remember. But in fact, you can remember if the mind is clear and sharp and focused and paying attention. And this is actually one of the skills that the Buddha mentioned, as this is one of the powers, is that we can remember really, really well. And for some reason, meditation has that quality of organization, cleaning out, getting the mind fit. And so, you can start looking at that for yourself. Is your early childhood memories actually improving now? Can you recollect what happened? Do you remember being in diapers, for instance?

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a whole lot of fun.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, as you were talking, I was kind of trying it out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was like, yeah, I was, uh, probably a little bit hungry the other night, and I started recollecting how much I used to like, uh, Honey Nut Cheerios and warm milk when I was a lot younger.

**Speaker A:** Okay, expand that. Go from just the food into the table you were sitting at, the chair that you were in. And start expanding that memory. How much can you remember the room that you were in? Do you remember the furnishings? Was this the kitchen? Do you remember the stove that was in the kitchen, etc.? Like that. Go now, take a memory tour of the house that you were in when you remember just having that cereal. That's how you break it. That's how you do that. And if you take a walkabout in the environment that you can remember a thread on, and you can pull that thread, and all of a sudden you remember everything about that house. Oh yeah, you remember your mommy's room, and you didn't spend much time in your mommy's room, but you remember it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** yep, yep. Yeah, so you see that, just be talking about it, and those memories are starting to come back. That we just weren't paying attention to anymore. And here we are walking around with this kind of library. It's got a whole lot of books that have been checked out and are missing, but that still doesn't mean that we have lost our childhood. That your childhood is still there and that you can pull things out and recollect and remember. And this— now let's get back to that article that you were talking about before, about that people, if they have lost their memory, they feel bad, but they really haven't lost it at all. It may have been lost through blunt force trauma, and the idea would be if they've had electroshock therapy that they have forgotten. But one of the happy stories about people who have had amnesia is that they just remember one thing, and then they start putting that together with other little memories around that one thing, and pretty soon, all of a sudden, everything clears up. And then now they come back and they remember their past. And so amnesia does not mean that the memories are lost forever, they're completely erased. What it really means is that those items are stored into your closet, but then that electroshock therapy filled up your whole closet and you can't find all of the old stuff because you've got all this new crap in the way. It's covering up. And we want that to be part of the practice in the sense that if we've got a lot of garbage and a lot of sewage and a lot of bad feelings and a lot of old memories that are trauma, by having new current memories that are always wholesome, that means that we're more likely going to be drawing on the newer stuff if it's wholesome. But unfortunately, what happens with most of us is that we start out with a wholesome childhood and then we layer it and layer and layered with huge amounts of unwholesome stuff, and it's hard to dig down to the original wholesomeness that was there when we were little kids. And not only that, but all of the traumas and all the stuff that's happened is what we use for an identity. That people who have lost their memory, one of the things that makes them miserable is they don't know who they are. The reality is, is that they will— whatever they are, whoever they are, they're not their memories. You are not.

**Speaker C:** Interesting. Yeah, I had an interesting reframe today, and this is for later conversation, or later, maybe later tonight, maybe tomorrow, or whenever I talk to you next, or whenever I talk to you about my father. But I got an email from him today that was full of unwholesome, and I responded to it in a very

**Speaker A:** wholesome— that letter yet? Don't, don't respond to an unwholesome letter the first month.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I responded to it, but I responded to it pretty wholesomely. And what was interesting about it is it was actually— we had a little exchange. So I sent the letter that I sent you yesterday with that little addition that you, that you asked to add, and then he responded pretty decently. And then I responded to that, you know, pretty, pretty good. And then he responded with a lot of unwholesome. And anyway, in that one with the lot of unwholesome, I responded to that pretty wholesomely. And as I was— after I sent it, I was thinking about that and how in responding to his letter, it caused me to want to find positive aspects of what he was talking about that I would not have found had he not been unwholesome to begin with. And it was about certain things where I found the positive, which I wouldn't have found had he not been so negative. And I realized that I've actually had a lot of confidence my whole life, in part because of how negative he's been. And it's forced me to have no choice but to either, you know, just be completely negative all the time or develop confidence in response. So I've taken on some negativity, but I've also taken some confidence because it's been part of how I've survived, you know. And so that was really interesting to have that reframe of, oh, I've actually gotten a lot of confidence in part from having to do this in order to get myself to go forward, you know. Because I have no other choice.

**Speaker A:** As difficult as mountain climbing is, when people do it, they feel confident because they have the success. And so if you can climb the mountain of your own father, that's quite an accomplishment. That gives us a feeling of success. I can handle that. And then at the bigger issue, when you climb the mountain of your own mind That gives you really supreme confidence that you can handle anything.

**Speaker C:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** All right. And part of that climbing of one's own mind is to look back into the valley and recognize and see things very, very clearly. We can recollect the past, that in fact it's very valuable to do so. But we're doing it intentionally, methodically, organized, with direct investigation, to where most of the past for ordinary people comes up randomly, haphazardly, unorganized, and let us say becomes a minefield. And so this is why in our practice we want to talk about and tell the students, do not mix in the past because the past is dangerous. But once we get the mind cleaned out, now the past is a paradise to go play in. Yeah, it's actually quite marvelous to remember. Hey man, I remember that doll that I got. I remember that bicycle. I remember the second bicycle because I got that when I was 6 years old. And it was a big bicycle.

**Speaker C:** That's great.

**Speaker A:** And so I remember these things, and it brings joy when you're clean because you are free and satisfied with this present moment. You can go back and become clean and free and satisfied with your entire past. So in the beginning, for the ordinary people, the past is a plague. It's a minefield. But for the one who is awake and alert and can see what's going on clearly, it becomes a pasture, it becomes a playground. And this is what the Buddha was talking about, is that we have really, really good ability to remember all kinds of things. Now that has been translated mostly by ignorant people reading the sutta, including ignorant translators, and trying to make this into magical stuff. But it actually is a real power, the power to have a really clear memory, that you can remember stuff. And in fact, that even goes to the point of when we're reading stuff now, that when we're reading stuff, because we are reading and paying attention to it, the stuff actually gets in. Most people, when they read, they read something and the eyes start moving down the page, and they're not— they're thinking about the literature that's being read, or being— that they're reading, not actually doing the reading. They're just thinking about it. We'll read one sentence and then have a thought, and the eyes continue along the page, but now the mind is just it right off into someplace because we don't have any control over it. And so this is another feature of memory, has to do with the fact that we've got to pay attention, we've got to really look. If we're reading, we should read, and if we're not reading, we should know that we're not reading, that we're just sitting here with this thing in front of us but we don't care enough about it to actually read it. That was the way that I first approached your article when you said it. And then I said, no, I'm actually going to read this thing and see what's there. That's why I remember so many of the details of it, was because I decided to actually read it.

**Speaker C:** Glad you did.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, it is a feature because in this article it also talks about how to erase the memories through this electroshock therapy, because the memory is what keeps people depressed. They keep hashing the same problems over and over and over again, and they get themselves kind of ground down. They grind themselves down with all this illegitimate thought process. And so giving them electroshock therapy is— basically what that does is that it rearranges everything. It's almost like that a whole basket clothes that you're carrying around, suddenly you throw them all up into the air, they come back and they land, but they don't land in the same order that they left in. So things get rearranged with this electroshock therapy, and people kind of forget a whole lot of stuff. And then, wow, what a relief that is! But then the identity crisis sets in, because who I am is based upon upon what I remember. It means I am my past, I am my thoughts, I am this, I am that. It's the mentality people have. And when their memories are forcibly taken away from them, either through blunt force trauma or through electroshock therapy, the relief of not having to think about all of that is then replaced with, yeah, but who the hell am I?

**Speaker C:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Because that question, who am I, is a common question that we all ask, but then we start to recollect and remember the past, and we kind of get the idea, oh, I know who I am because I remember who I am. But this guy who's got this electroshock therapy, who am I? He's got no answer to that question. Then in fact, many of the movies and whatnot about people who have amnesia, the whole story of the whole movie The whole movie is all about them trying to go back to figure out who they were, and all they get out of it is the memories come back, but they still haven't figured out who they are. But they are under the delusion of they know who they are now because they've got their memories back and they remember who they are. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I'd like to share something.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So when I was— when I visited my dad in Arizona to conquer that mountain, which I did, my grandma lives with my dad and she's having major memory loss, Alzheimer's or whatever it is, and usually quite miserable because of it. But being a Dhamma dude, I went in there with Joy, and she was basically— she didn't remember who I was, uh, and so she was meeting this new person, you know, not as what she remembered me as a child or whatever, but as some wandering man that just, you know arrived at the house, and she began to actually share the most wholesome memories from her childhood with me over and over and over and over again. And every time, I responded like it was the first time I heard it, just with, you know, just so much excitement. Thanks so much for sharing this with me. This is great. And she would share it again and again and again. And yeah, it was the most wholesome, uh, the greatest experience I've ever had with my grandma. And she didn't have a clue who I was. It doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Well, what did matter though was, is that, uh, your joy and your cheer triggered something in her or something that you did, so that she began to look for something really pleasant in her life, and all she can bring up was childhood memories. And that's exactly correct, that when people suffer in old age through Alzheimer's, that's all that they tend to be able to remember, that all the stuff that happened when they were adult, they tend to forget. But those childhood memories really are there. They're just stored in the back of our mental closet. And so when the front part of her closet is damaged, now she's just so miserable her whole life. Alzheimer's patients are notorious for being grumpy, really, really grumpy. But you were able to go in there with your joy and get her to go past that grumpiness of the adult and go back to those really fond childhood memories.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was wonderful.

**Speaker A:** That everybody is— it's really hard for most of us to realize that the best times of our lives happened before we were 5 years old, because that was a time of wonder, that was a time of investigation. Later childhood and adulthood is all about what we know, not about what we're discovering.

**Speaker B:** Ah yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and so childhood is all about discovery. It's fascinating to a child. Everything is fascinating to a child. Okay, so getting that, that childhood wonder or that fascination back again is part of the process of awakening, to where Alzheimer's is almost like the consolation prize, because that's all she's got left, because all of the adult memories and all of that kind of stuff. In fact, it's quite interesting to look at the autopsies of the brains

**Speaker C:** through

**Speaker A:** an autopsy of people who have had Alzheimer's. In fact, the brain damage that is seen in the autopsy is the actual definition of Alzheimer's. You really don't know what's going on with a person until after they die, and then they cut the brain open to see the rot, the real rot that's in the brain that is caused by Alzheimer's. And they still haven't quite figured out why it's true. But one of the major suspects is Tab, Coca-Cola's Tab. They took it off the market, by the way.

**Speaker B:** Oh, the drink, the soda, the drink.

**Speaker A:** Tab had a chemical in it that seems to have been part of the reason why people have so much Alzheimer's now. The other possibility is because people are living longer now. And that the older you get, the worse the brain gets. It's just part of the deterioration of old age. But there is significant, significant evidence that needs to be researched. We can't actually point the blame at the finger and say, 'Tab did it.' But I do know that Tab is suspected, that the chemicals in Tab are the things that bring on Alzheimer's. Um, uh, the chemicals that are used for sweetening— in the old days, all they had was saccharin, but saccharin, uh, had a very bitter taste. It really— things weren't sweet with saccharin at all. And so,

**Speaker D:** um, um, so this thing

**Speaker A:** is called— yeah, yeah, I think the word is, is aspartame. Aspartame is a chemical that seems to be, uh, not fully researched but indicates that, uh, Alzheimer's is caused by, um, these kind of drinks.

**Speaker D:** People still do, uh, aspartame as like a sugar, uh, like replacement, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, that's why they put it in the tab.

**Speaker D:** It's, uh, they use that in diet too, right? In diet, isn't, isn't diet soda using, uh, aspartame?

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point. That's it. That's why people drink these drinks is because they're, they're diet drinks or whatnot like that. And there's other issues.

**Speaker D:** I don't really, I mean, I don't like diet personally. I think it tastes gross.

**Speaker C:** I don't drink soda. When I was a kid, I did. I love soda. I could actually go right back into the memory bank now and pull out some soda memories.

**Speaker A:** Okay, right. I was talking about it, begins to hook this up. So this is what you guys will probably do today, is to start opening that memory bank, knowing that you can do so safely.

**Speaker D:** Now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** That once the mind is cleaned out, we can deal with that past and get things organized so that we remember. But that memory does not define who you are now. Going back to that question, that's in fact the entire point, is, is that people who have this loss of memory have a loss of identity, that their past identified who they were, and they know who they were, at least enough. But when people are, let's say, going on the spiritual path and begin to ask their questions— could a lot of people ask me about, well, who am I? Like, that's the most important question that there is. And the Buddha says, no, that who am I is an irrelevant question. Just bound to keep people locked up in the wrong kinds of things. So basically, that's what we could call an identity crisis, is when we don't know who we are, and for some reason or another, it becomes important, when in fact, who I am is not important at all. What is important, what is worthy of evaluation, is the Four Noble Truths. This is suffering, this is the cause of it, this is the end of suffering. And so when we pay attention that way to what's going on, we can also do that with the mind in the past. Now, one of the things that's kind of important to point out with this is that Some thoughts, some feelings, some past memories are wholesome and some are not. The average ordinary person doesn't make that kind of distinction, and for them, recollecting the past is dangerous because it'll bring up bad feelings. Especially if I remember the argument that I had with Aunt Susie last week, and then I remember I had an argument with Aunt Susie a year ago, and now all of a sudden I really hate Aunt Susie. Yeah, and probably that, but I have the memory of hating Aunt Susie because I've been arguing with her for years, right? And, and so that's all we remember of Aunt Susie. But when we can clean that, all that argument stuff out, we can begin to remember Aunt Susie the way Aunt Susie actually was, not about what we did with her. Within our mind.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. You know what's interesting about that is often after people die, we tend to think of them more positively, whether it's someone that we actually know in our lives or even a famous person. Like, we'll often think of them more positively. Whenever we reflect on them, it's much more about their positive traits. And it's like, why couldn't we have done that while they were alive?

**Speaker A:** Why can't you do that while you're still alive?

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** and in a way, this is what we're doing, is that we're going back into the past and we're recollecting it cleanly, not with the feelings of identity and who we were and all of that kind of stuff. So we can remember getting insulted, but we don't have to feel insulted when we remember that we were insulted, even if we felt insulted when it happened. Now we remember it Normally when people remember it, they also remember that not only that I was insulted at that time, but now I feel insulted when I remember it. The trick is, can you remember the insult joyfully without feeling insulted right now? The feeling is optional, the memory is there. But we almost always associate the feelings that we had with the event, that it was me that got insulted, therefore, when I think of being insulted, it's me who gets insulted again, rather than it's just a memory. That's the identity or "who am I" kind of question that the Buddha says, that question is bound to cause us suffering if we try to figure out who we are, because who we are is defined by all the crap best that's ever happened to us. That is better to see that crap as crap and then throw it out, get it out. In the beginning, we want to throw out the memories and the crap and everything and just be here now. But once the mind is really cleaned out, now we can go back into those memories and really see things the way that they actually were, rather than how we felt when it happened.

**Speaker C:** Actually, there's something I've been meaning to ask you for a little while now. This just reminded me of— so I remember on one of your calls, you were talking about— I don't know if I was on the call, if it was a YouTube video, I forget— but you were talking about a neuroscientist that you said was teaching the Dhamma without even knowing what the Dhamma was. He was doing it on YouTube. What is the name of the scientist? I would love to watch this.

**Speaker A:** Don't remember. Oh, that's too bad, because I could name you a lot of scientists or philosophers and such who do really wholesome things. And then there are others who are doing really unwholesome things, and most of us are a mixed bag. Yeah, but I would say that as neuroscience is growing and improving, it's going towards the truth that they really do want to know what's actually going on inside the mind. That's exactly what the Buddha was doing 2,500 years ago, so he just got a little head start on them is all.

**Speaker C:** Right. Well, I really liked that video, the UK Sangha video. I got pretty far in. It's quite a long one, so I haven't quite finished it yet. But you and I believe Debbie, the Indian woman— yes, yeah, you were discussing the neuroscience. She was discussing the neuroscience about building habits, you know, habitual ways of thinking and that kind of— it's very interesting, you know, to listen to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, within the past year or two, she's actually gotten her new PhD in behavioral psychology. And so that was her foundation. That was why that discussion was so interesting. Yeah, and yeah, that was one of

**Speaker C:** the best ones I've heard.

**Speaker A:** Well, right at the end of it, Robert brought up some readings that he had done about left brain, right brain, because there was research done on stroke victims, because strokes normally will happen in one area of the brain that just happens to be on one side or the other. And so the stroke victims, the research on stroke victims gave the idea of the left brain and the right brain and all of that. Debbie was quick to point out— she was even faster to point out than I— that it looks like that it has more to do with the layers of the brain rather than the left and the right. That there are certain things that have to do with the left and the right because of the twist in the spinal cord. The actual functions of the left hand are performed with the right anterior cortex, and the functions of the right hand are handled on the left side of the cortex. We can do easy brain scans to see that, but that doesn't mean that the entire brain is split in two. Doesn't mean that at all. But in fact, under that, there's a bridge that connects the frontal cortex on both sides. But what they fail to talk about is, is that under that bridge, the solid neurons, they there's a gap, but that gap actually is filled in where you have brain cells touching each other down through there, that there's no real separation in this vertical sense, that it much more has to do with evolution of layers, that the bottom layer would be the cellular layer, the next layer would be the insect mind layer. The next layer above that would be the reptilian layer, and that's where we really get into things because our human body actually functions the way that a reptile's brain functions. And so the anterior cortex is very much like a reptile, and then the midcortex is very much like the animal, the mammals, and then the top of the frontal cortex. And so this is something that we discuss later in there. That there is no real distinction behaviorally anymore, that the scientists have gotten beyond their left brain/right brain business and beginning to look at it structurally in the same realm that we look at things functionally, in the sense that we can function like a reptile. And when we function like a reptile, we're using the area of the brain, the structure of the brain that's reptilian. When we're acting like an animal, when we're functioning like an animal, we're doing that in the area of the brain that animals function, what they call the mammalian brain or the temporal cortex, this area around here. And so, when we're acting human, really human, top-quality human, that means that we're altruistic that we take care of each other, that we're nurturing, and all of that, as well as smart and brilliant. That's done with the frontal cortex. And so the function of being human is done by the structure that only humans have. This is new research. This is really— I mean, Debbie's got a PhD in this stuff.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, very cool.

**Speaker A:** So he's really into that kind of thing. And so, uh, yeah, she was the first one to correct it that it's not left brain, right brain. And then I chimed in, but she had already stolen all my thunder. I was about to jump on that left brain, right brain stuff with both feet. He beat me to it.

**Speaker D:** Uh, I would like to ask her about this guy James Nestor who talks about the whales, the beluga whale, having the part of the brain that makes us human is like 6 times larger in the beluga whale, or is it the— it's a sperm whale actually. The sperm whale is 6 times larger in there. I think that's an interesting, uh, concept to explore.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, that's one of the things that they're finding out, that there are species of animals that live on this planet that are smarter than humans. They just didn't do it with mathematics. They did it with logistics. They did it with navigation. I mean, whales, they really— there are actual individual whales that have been all over. None of us have been all over. None of us have gone off the coast of Japan and then off the coast of China and then off the coast of the Philippines and then circled the islands of the Philippines and down into the Gulf of Thailand and all of that stuff. None of us have done any of that kind of stuff, and they do it with knowledge. They know where all the feeding grounds are and everything like that. Whales are just amazing creatures.

**Speaker C:** So, so I've got to ask, so what do you think of those cases where like a guy gets struck by lightning and then suddenly he's a master piano virtuoso?

**Speaker A:** Never happened.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's happened.

**Speaker A:** Stories about that. Well, there's good stories. I mean, we can— that's not possible.

**Speaker C:** It's happened. It's happened. I'm gonna look it up right now. Um, man gets— well, it's not possible

**Speaker A:** for you and me.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we try to explain it. There are some things that we just can't explain. I would say that there are things that we can't explain But becoming a virtuoso on the piano by someone who has spent their whole life not playing the piano, and then in middle age or late age he gets struck by lightning and all of a sudden he's a piano virtuoso the way that I am— yeah, this is not a chance. No, he cannot play— he could not play Franz Liszt, um, um, attitude or a nocturne unless he's heard it.

**Speaker C:** No, they, they've actually like recorded this. They have videos of this guy. They have an interview with them. I'll send you the article.

**Speaker A:** Okay. What did that mean? Did he— that all of a sudden he could play one piece of music, five pieces of music? When I use the word piano virtuoso, I'm I'm talking about someone who has a vocabulary or a repertoire of thousands of songs.

**Speaker C:** All right, so here's what happened. So here's the interview. So they asked him, tell us what happened when you woke up from the lightning strike. Well, I woke really pissed because it was painful and I didn't want to be there. When the lightning hit me in the face and where it came out my foot, it was like somebody had stuck a hot poker in both the places. I was able to get up and walk, so my family just loaded me in the car and took me home. That was kind of a beginning of everything. And they asked, how do you mean it was the beginning of everything? I was a bit foggy at first, but the fog cleared after a few weeks, and then I started to have this incredible desire to hear classical music. So I bought this CD of Vladimir Ashkenazi, a famous Russian pianist, playing his favorite Chopin. I started listening to it nonstop. Then I made everyone else listen to it as well. I'm sure they were pretty sick of it. But then I had this realization that listening to this would not be enough. I would need to learn how to play it. So you got a piano and started playing. How did that go at first? You know, my hands had no idea what to do. I was struggling to wrap my head around every aspect of it. It was really hard, but I just started teaching myself. A little while later, yada yada yada, you dream your own composition. Yep. And I got up and I walked to the piano that was sitting in the living room. I started picking out some of the melodies I heard, but didn't— okay, this goes on and on. But

**Speaker A:** basically, you see how you announced that, and my initial response was, that's impossible. And as I started to describe how it could be possible, and you started reading that, and what you're reading is what I would say could could be done. In other words, he actually got very interested and very curious in Chopin. Yeah, no one learns to play Chopin unless they really love Chopin. You've got to hear it first. You gotta hear it over and over and over and over and over again and get that stuff wired in. Now, I would go so far as to say that the white lightning strike was irrelevant.

**Speaker D:** Maybe it made him realize that life's short and he should, you know, figure out— he realized, I like this, maybe I should put some skin in the game, that kind of thing.

**Speaker A:** He had to put some skin in the game, exactly. You cannot say that he got struck by lightning and all of a sudden he woke up, the fog clears, and now he's just all over the keyboard. No, when he sat down to the keyboard, he had strong desire to learn to play and he recognized that his fingers did not have the muscle memory that it would take to play Chopin. But guess what? He practiced and he developed that muscle memory, but he did so out of the desire for really wanting to do it. There is nothing magical there. In fact, this has nothing to do with being hit by lightning, it has to do with the love of Chopin.

**Speaker D:** That's like far off, basically.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what'd you say?

**Speaker D:** Um, I said that's a lot of, uh, distant cause and effect you're trying to put together, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That, that everybody is putting— oh, he learned to play Chopin because he was struck by lightning. No, he learned to play the piano because he— while after he was struck by lightning, he fell in love with Chopin and he really wanted to learn to play it.

**Speaker D:** Next thing we're going to talk about, you started Israel.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. This is exactly the same thing. It's exactly the same thing. The cause and effect are too distant to have a direct link that it was the— thank you for reading that, that's very good. I mean, what an excellent education to recognize about magical thinking. It's magical thinking to think that people get struck by lightning and now they're virtuoso piano players. Didn't happen that way.

**Speaker B:** It makes for a great story!

**Speaker A:** Oh, it makes a great story though, and all we have to do is just leave out some of the key details. Details. Like when he tried to sit down to play the piano, he recognized he didn't have the motor skills. But he developed those motor skills, because he wanted to. And not only that, but if you listen to a piece of music over and over and over and over again, I got a good example of that, because this just happened last night. That when I was looking through some of the music library that I had, I ran across a video of— this one is Beethoven's, one of the sonatas, it's actually referred to as

**Speaker D:** the Moonlight

**Speaker A:** Sonata, but I'm talking about most specifically the second and the third movements. And in this video, it has both the sheet music and also a keyboard at the bottom, and then when the when the note is being played, they've got little bars or things like that so you can see the music coming. Well, I learned the first movement, learned the second movement, but that third movement always gave me a lot of trouble. And here I am sitting now at my computer and seeing the sheet music, listening to this thing, and watching the little dots come back and forth of where the keys are on the keyboard, and I'm actually there being able to recollect and play that thing with my fingers. I could, you know, I can do it this way, and when the bass goes down, I'm doing it like this. I'm sitting here, I'm wondering if everybody in the household is looking at me crazy with my fingers because I'm actually playing a piano right here, except that there's no physical keyboard. The keyboard is up here, but the music Every note is there. And I can contrast that with— there's a movie called Copying Beethoven, is the name of the movie, 2006, and it's a story about a woman who was a composer and a music copyist, and that Beethoven asked for help, and the professor at the university sent his best student, who happened to be a young 23-year-old woman. And so, the whole movie now is about Beethoven's relationship to this young woman, that ends with him actually directing the first opening performance of the Ninth Symphony, while she's sitting in the stage below where nobody can see her, and she's directing, and he's watching her direct. Because he's completely deaf. Okay? But in there, in the movie, they are actually chopping up Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. And every time that they play part of it, and I get into it, I'm listening to it, and then they'll cut and they'll play another part of that symphony, and my mind goes, "What?!" I was expecting you to play it correctly, and here you are just chopping it up. Because this is a movie and you can't play the whole thing in a movie because the whole piece of music lasts for an hour. Oh, it's one of the longest pieces of music. In fact, when they first started doing CDs, one of the guys who was part of the manufacturing process says you cannot put CDs out on the market unless you can get all of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one side It's got to be played from here to there. And that's how I remember Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, is from here to there. You start it and then you keep going on it. And in this movie, they're chopping it up and they're putting some of the fourth movement in the first movement, some of the first— I mean, it was just all over the place. And so I imagine that the real musicians, when they hear that movie, they hate it. Because the editors of it chopped the thing up. So anyway, the point here is that even people who are really skilled at music, that is a real skill that happens inside the mind. The mind gets organized in a completely different way by listening to Classical music. And stuff like that. And that also, the writers of it in the first part of the movie were quite brilliant. I think that they did a fairly good job, for their ability, to climb into the mind of Beethoven, because they had to present him as how he was acting and behaving. Because we have really good evidence that he in fact died from syphilis, and was going crazy. While he wrote the Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, he was actually pretty close to death. That this is his Ode to Joy. In fact, the Ode to Joy is his last gasp. That's it. And so this is his death march, and it's an Ode to Joy. And they showed him in that kind of thing. Going back to your example of the guy who has an event with lightning, and then he picks it up, that's actually quite promising, because a lot of people say, "Oh, well, I can't do that, because only someone who's been struck by lightning can become a virtuoso as an adult." The answer is, he wasn't a virtuoso, but he did learn to play Chopin, but he learned to play Chopin because he loved Chopin.

**Speaker D:** Srotapanna.

**Speaker A:** He got a CD, so it's the article, and he listened to it over and over and over and over and over and over again. And I say over and over again because I'm making the point of repetition, right? That actually he listened to that music enough to where he knew it note by note in his mind, and all he had to do now was connect the fingers to the music. And that was the only thing he had to do because he had already learned the music itself.

**Speaker C:** Sure.

**Speaker D:** I was gonna, uh, I think you might have already answered it, but how do you think Beethoven, uh, became as masterful as he did, especially being deaf?

**Speaker A:** Repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition. Repetition, repetition, repetition, repetition. That in fact, that was one of the things I remember having lectures when I was in music school about Beethoven, would take one little phrase and refine it and get it correct, and then repeat that same phrase over and over and over and over and over again, and that was his music. Repetition. You can see it in the Fifth Symphony so easily. I mean, it just slaps you in the face, the repetition in there. It's just the same 4 notes, and the whole symphony is 4 notes repeated over and over and over and over again. And that's how symphonies operate. That's the whole point of these long classical music is just all built on repetition. Getting to know that, start analyzing the music, listening to it over and over again, especially if you've got the sheet music there. You don't even have to learn to read music. All you need to do is to see how dense it is, how dense sense is this piece of paper, and then you start to be able to follow along what they're doing. This is a skill that to be developed, and then that gives you the whole idea about how, oh, what was on page 3 is now on page 6. It's the same darn thing, the same thing over and over and over and over again, the whole thing. Another example of that is the Girl from Empinima. You know that song? You already got it going in your head. Okay, so listen how many times it's repeated. The whole song is just those

**Speaker D:** notes.

**Speaker A:** It's the whole show. It's the whole song. Over and over and over again. So if this guy is listening to Chopin and listening to that CD over and over and over and over again, every node gets put into place exactly. Now Chopin is at a certain quality. It's a certain— some, some of the stuff that Chopin done is absolutely brilliant, but it does not compare to Beethoven. Beethoven stuff is sometimes much more complicated, much more sophisticated in the way that it puts things together. But it all is based upon repetition. Everything is repeated over and over and over. That's your whole life, in fact. Your whole life is nothing but something that you've done before. This is why we use the word 'react.' This is what the whole teaching of the Buddha is about is stop doing what you've been doing because you're in the habit of doing it and start making some new music in your life instead of listening to the same old tired stuff that you've been doing over and over and over again. Let's go on an adventure. This makes sense here.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so it's funny, this gets back to the article, you know, because the guy that wrote the article had the injury He was talking about how when it first happened, he felt it was a new beginning for him. You know, and he did a lot of things he never had done before. Like he went and like joined like spiritual groups and, you know, was like going on trips and all of this. And he felt very liberated, you know, by being free of those old patterns and that old repetition. But then eventually he felt he couldn't really like live as someone without an identity. And so there's a way in which our identity, you know, which is just repetition, right, in which that traps us, and yet we still kind of feel the need to have it, or many of us do, in order to navigate society.

**Speaker A:** Eric, do you got a bear? Was that Kishon's bear that you went to see?

**Speaker B:** I went to take a leak and it was more of a Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker D:** We're actually gonna do a night hike.

**Speaker A:** Well, listen carefully.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we'll do.

**Speaker C:** I don't think we have bears in Washington.

**Speaker A:** I don't think so, but, but Keishon's got them in his mind. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Uh, Eric, have you heard of any bears? I haven't.

**Speaker B:** What's that?

**Speaker C:** I haven't heard of any bears in Washington.

**Speaker B:** I've seen bears in Washington.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you have?

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they've got woods in Washington. Now you're going to be afraid of bears, I know.

**Speaker C:** Oh boy, first mosquitoes, now bears. Yeah. Oh, I want to share this email from my father, but Maybe when you

**Speaker A:** guys get off, or— Yeah, let's do that later. We've got other things to do. In fact, this call is kind of coming to an end or winding down, but I really do appreciate that we were able to talk about that issue about memory and memory loss and how we identify with our memories. But when we no longer are concerned with our memories, because now our focus in life is dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, and coming out of the dukkha. Now we can go back into the past and see exactly what was going on without having the emotional baggage that we normally associate with our past. Like, for instance, that I mentioned to you about the bicycle, the 5th birthday present Okay, if I think of that bicycle now as my bicycle and how good I felt when I got that present, because at least it was better than a Howdy Doody doll that I'd gotten the year before, now I can begin to long for, oh, I would like to see a bicycle like that. Maybe I can look on eBay or Amazon. They still have those kind of bicycles. On eBay. And then I look on eBay and I'm disappointed because there's no bicycles just like that, because that bicycle was in honor of a TV star, The Long Ranger, and we haven't had Long Ranger TV series since 1954. So the likelihood of them producing bicycles like that is zero. So it would be impossible for me to get that kind of bicycle again. If I want it, I'm suffering. If I can just let that be a memory and I can just allow it to be a fond old memory without wanting that bicycle now, then it's a good memory. But if I remember that bicycle and then want it again, now I'm suffering. That's the problem with our memories, is that we remember it almost as the good old days, like it was better then, I long for it to be like that. And so we wind up in a state of longing and wishful thinking and misery, when in fact the Buddha provides us with a skill that we can go back and re-feel that way. We can actually feel the way that we felt like we were when we were kids, we can get the excitement of that brand new bicycle without a brand new bicycle. Because it was just a feeling. And we can create our own feelings when we're in charge of our own feelings. We can create the feelings that we want to, and we can still then have that memory without identifying with the memory. It's not me, because who I am is irrelevant to my joy. But if my identity is relevant to my joy— that's what both of these guys with both the lightning strike and the electroencephalograms, or the electroshock therapy, they both suffered an identity crisis, right? Because of the loss of memory and whatnot like that. Well, everybody has an identity crisis. On a regular basis because we don't know who we are. But the Buddha recommends, well, don't ask that question because you're not going to get a good answer. And part of the reason why there's not a good answer to who we are is because you're a moving target. You are not fixed. Anicca, Vajrayana, Sankhara— everything is in flux. So what you were yesterday— I mean, yesterday there was a Kishon who hated bugs. Now there is a Kishon today that wears a hat. It's not the same dude.

**Speaker C:** So actually, that's one reason that childhood toys are a really good thing to test out with this, because you wouldn't want a toy that you had as a kid as an adult. So you can just go back to that memory and feel completely neutral without wanting that thing. Whereas if you went back to 2 years ago to something you wanted, you might actually want the thing that you had 2 years ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't have to go back to 1949 to remember a bicycle and want it. I can go back to 1972 to my BMW motorcycle and want it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, there you go. And if you go back to 1949, it might be a trike, and you're not going to want a trike, you know, maybe for your daughter. Although she's too big for that, you know.

**Speaker A:** Oh, she's beyond that. Yeah, she's 9.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, she's beyond.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when she stands to hug me, she comes all the way up to here on me. She's not a kid anymore.

**Speaker D:** Remember I got this really incredible toy. It was an Air Hog. It like flies. It's like a little airplane drone thing.

**Speaker A:** And I was pretty young.

**Speaker D:** And the first time I fired it up after charging it, just getting so excited, I just flew it directly into a tree in the neighbor's yard. And it was gone. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Short life.

**Speaker A:** But you can also have that memory of that flying object hitting the tree, but it's me hitting the tree. Oh no, my poor thing! It's like that. But now you can have that memory and, oh yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I felt so bad then, but right now I'm really enjoying remembering it. Yeah, we have to disassociate the feelings of these memories so that we can meet them as memories rather than who I am. That the whole idea that we're talking about then is not a loss of memory itself, because you really don't need to remember anything. What is really the issue with these guys that you're talking about is loss of identity. They thought they knew who they were, and now they don't know who they are. And they don't like that because they thought that they did know who they are. But when we accepted, hey, I don't even know who I am, and that's okay.

**Speaker C:** That's great.

**Speaker A:** And so it's not just memory versus happiness. No, you can have the happiness and your memories, or you can be happy without the memories. That happiness is optional to the memories. But what most people do is that they remember, and then they remember not only what happened, they remember how they feel about it, and then they feel bad again. So we repeat the action. The action is the feelings that we have as a result to the events that are actually in the outside world, instead of just of recording the events, we package me into that event and then store that. So the feelings and the identities that we have with these old feelings can be removed through proper training, and now that memory bank just opens up with enormous amounts of information. And you can recollect what it was like when you were a child, and those things can be extremely pleasant to remember, is like. I mean, even your grandmother, uh, Eric, was like that, that that was her best part of the day, is remembering things that happened when she was a little child with all the baggage of the memories of being adult and who I am and identity and all of that kind of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And the funny part about it is, all of this that we're talking about is this is in the sutta, but it's badly translated, and so it looks magical.

**Speaker B:** Instead of even— because I've read the sutra before and didn't quite understand it in this way at all. So this has been really great.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Well guys, let's finish this off. This has been a delightful conversation as usual, and thank you so much, uh, uh, Robert, for bringing this point up. About memory, memory loss, and other things like that. Arahant, because we really— unless there's really physical damage like with Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's, we know for sure that that is a rotting of the actual cortexes of the brain, but lightning strikes don't do that. Electroencephalograms or Electroshock therapy doesn't destroy the brain the way that alcohol and Alzheimer's does, which means that everything that's ever happened to you is buried down in there someplace, is just buried under a bunch of dirt. And when you clean the dirt out of the way, you can begin to— that stuff just bubbles right up. One of the clearest ways that you can see that is when the student at university is getting ready for an exam. If he was paying attention in class and got what was going on, then he doesn't need to study; all he has to do is remember. But most students are not paying attention in class, therefore they've got to go study later, and when they do it, they do it under pressure instead of just enjoying the learning and then testing it, because, you know, now we've got fear of the exam itself, and that fear of the exam is often going to be what we've got on our mind when we go in there, and therefore we're going to screw up that exam because we're afraid of taking the exam because we don't think that we're properly prepared because we weren't paying attention in the first place. So if the student goes into the class in the beginning of the class with the understanding or the intention, "I'm going to listen to what this guy's saying, because it's going to make me taking the exam a piece of cake." That's the way to go to college, is to go to college with the full intention, "I'm going to listen, I'm going to learn, I'm going to pay attention, I'm going to get this information, and then because I've got it, the exam Anicca, Anapanasati, Anagami's a piece of cake.

**Speaker C:** That's usually how I did it. I just pay attention and engage a lot, and then I wouldn't study that much. A little bit, you know, what I wasn't familiar with.

**Speaker A:** Don't have to study when you know the material. Yeah, yes, exactly. And so when I see students on interviews and I talk, and then I see them writing down, and I have to pause because I got to wait for them time to finish writing, that really when you're taking notes in school, you're not paying attention. Or let us say that you paid attention long enough to get the note and say, oh, I've got to write that down. And while I'm writing down, student not listening anymore. And the teachers are not going to stop while people are writing stuff down. So if you're taking notes, you're only listening to about half of what's being said,

**Speaker C:** right?

**Speaker A:** But if you're not taking notes because you are actually taking the information in, because you're paying attention to it, you're listening, you're observing, in that regard there's really nothing special about the teachings of the Buddha at all. Because this is just life. Then if you really want a hard time, then take notes and worry about the exam, and then you'll have a low grade, or you can walk in there and just pay really close attention to what's going on, and now the exam's a piece of cake. And in fact, many of the times when the students are taking the exam, they're not actually taking the exam, they're worried about taking the exam while they're taking the exam. And if you're worried about taking the exam while you're taking the exam— oh, what will my score be? Oh, did I get that one right? And all of those kind of things— you're not going to do as good a job.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I had a professor that was really good about that where he didn't have any exams. He just had papers, just 2 papers. That's all to do the whole class. You get to choose whatever topic as long as related to the class, one of the books or a couple of the books, but he wouldn't have any exams. There's no pressure to memorize this stuff, so you could just listen to him talk and, you know, engage with him and then just write the paper.

**Speaker A:** The paper comes And right, so that exam winds up being pressure for people when they don't have to feel pressurized by taking an exam at all.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and I remember a lot more of that class than ones where I had the pressures of the exams.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that amazing? Isn't that amazing? Exactly, that we remember things when we're paying attention to stuff. Well, guess what? When we were little kids we really paid attention to stuff. It was curious. I mean, we had— when we were little kids, the world was a marvelous place to investigate. And when we get older, now getting the job done is far more important than having fun investigating. So really, the Dhamma dude's life is all about learning to be a kid again, to learn to investigate, to look, to pay attention, to be eagerly wanting to know, to see. Curiosity is the name of the game, as opposed to, "Oh, you've got to learn this. Oh, you've got to make a good grade. You've got to prove who you are." That's what our society has done to us. Can we come back to being a kid again? Go play, guys. Let's finish this up. But this has been a marvelous talk. I really enjoyed this. Haven't been able to talk about it so much because I'm so much too into teaching the students the beginning part of you got to get out of the past, you got to get out of the past because it's so emotionally laden. But once you've gotten out of the past and you got your mind really cleaned up, now the past is a wonderful playground.

**Speaker B:** So excited to play around and check into, explore, and go on an adventure.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker C:** Awesome.

**Speaker A:** Well guys, this has been great. We'll see you later. I really like your hat, Keyshawn. I really like your hat.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's a cool hat.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye

**Speaker D:** guys.

**Speaker A:** Cheers. See you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, explores the relationship between **memory, identity, and happiness**, using an article about electroshock therapy and memory loss as a starting point. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Themes**

1. **Memory vs. Happiness**
   - The talk begins with a discussion about electroshock therapy (ECT) for depression, which can cause memory loss. The article posed a dilemma: Is it better to lose your memories and be happy, or keep your memories and remain depressed?
   - Dhammarato clarifies that ECT doesn’t lead to true happiness; it may relieve depression but leaves people confused and unhappy because they can’t remember why they were unhappy, yet the habitual pattern of unhappiness remains.

2. **Skillful vs. Unskillful Remembering**
   - Not all memories are equal. Some are wholesome and useful, while others are detrimental (e.g., constantly recalling a past insult).
   - The Buddha’s teaching is about **emotionally unloading memories**—retaining the factual memory without the “garbage” of attached negative feelings. This is likened to organizing a cluttered closet: we keep what’s useful and discard what harms us.

3. **The Buddha’s “Powers” and Misinterpretations**
   - The group discusses the **Lion’s Roar Sutta (Sutta 12)**, where the Buddha addresses misconceptions about his teachings. People wrongly believed he taught magical powers (e.g., flying, reading minds).
   - The Buddha emphasized knowing **what is possible vs. impossible**. True power lies in understanding cause and effect, not in supernatural abilities. For example, you cannot truly know another’s thoughts, only observe their behavior.

4. **Memory as a Skill**
   - One of the Buddha’s actual “powers” is **exceptional memory**—the ability to recollect past events clearly. This is not magical but results from a mind that is “cleaned out” and organized.
   - When we detach memories from their emotional baggage (through meditation and mental cultivation), we can access past experiences without suffering. The past becomes a “playground” rather than a “minefield.”

5. **Identity Crisis and Memory**
   - People often equate their **identity with their memories**. Loss of memory (from ECT, amnesia, or trauma) leads to an identity crisis: “Who am I if I can’t remember my past?”
   - The Buddha taught that asking “Who am I?” is not useful. Identity is fluid (*anicca*—impermanence). Happiness doesn’t depend on a fixed identity or memory.

6. **Reclaiming Childhood Wonder**
   - Childhood memories are often the most vivid and joyful because children explore the world with curiosity and presence.
   - As adults, we lose this wonder by getting caught in habits, responsibilities, and negative thought patterns. The Dhamma path encourages returning to that state of **curious investigation**—paying attention, being present, and finding joy in discovery.

### **Practical Insights**

- **Organize Your Mental “Closet”**: Through meditation, we can sort through memories, keep what’s wholesome, and release attached negative emotions.
- **Investigate the Past Safely**: Once the mind is calm and clear, we can revisit past memories without being overwhelmed by them. This can be done by recalling sensory details (e.g., the room, objects, sounds) to gently expand memory.
- **Focus on the Four Noble Truths**: Instead of asking “Who am I?”, focus on understanding suffering, its cause, its end, and the path. This leads to freedom regardless of memory or identity.
- **Cultivate Curiosity**: Approach life like a child—with attention, wonder, and a desire to learn. This is key to both happiness and clear memory.

### **Conclusion**

The talk reframes memory loss not as a path to happiness but as a loss of identity that causes confusion. True happiness comes from **skillful remembering**—retaining useful memories without emotional baggage—and from living with present-moment awareness and curiosity. By cleaning the mind and letting go of fixed identities, we can access the past joyfully and live freely in the present.

The discussion blends Buddhist suttas, personal anecdotes, and psychological insights, emphasizing a practical, non-magical interpretation of the Dhamma that focuses on mental training and ethical living.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**

1. **The Closet / Memory Bank**  
   - The mind is compared to a cluttered closet where memories are stored haphazardly. When you need something, you often find unrelated or painful items in the way. Meditation is likened to organizing this closet—cleaning, sorting, and discarding what’s no longer needed.

2. **Vehicle Loaded with Garbage**  
   - Memories can be like a vehicle carrying emotional “garbage” (bad feelings from past events). The practice involves using the memory as a vehicle but unloading the emotional baggage attached to it.

3. **Minefield vs. Playground**  
   - For an untrained mind, the past is a **minefield**—dangerous and likely to trigger suffering. For a trained mind, it becomes a **playground** or **pasture**—a safe space for exploration and joy.

4. **Thread Pulling**  
   - Recollecting memories is like pulling a thread; starting with one detail (e.g., a childhood meal) can unravel a whole network of related memories (the room, the house, etc.).

5. **Basket of Clothes Thrown in the Air**  
   - Electroshock therapy is compared to throwing a basket of clothes into the air; they land in a disordered way, rearranging memories but not erasing them.

6. **Mountain Climbing**  
   - Dealing with personal challenges (e.g., a difficult relationship) is like climbing a mountain. Successfully navigating it builds confidence, just as climbing the “mountain of your own mind” leads to supreme confidence.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1. **Electroshock Therapy Article**  
   - The talk begins with a story about an article on electroshock therapy, exploring the trade-off between memory loss and relief from depression. This frames the discussion on memory, identity, and happiness.

2. **The Buddha’s “Lion’s Roar” Sutta (Sutta 12)**  
   - The story of the Buddha addressing a monk who complained that the Buddha only taught about suffering and not magical powers. The Buddha lists what he *can* do (e.g., distinguish possible from impossible) and dismisses supernatural claims (e.g., walking through walls). This is used to critique magical thinking and highlight practical wisdom.

3. **Sherlock Holmes & The Missing Watch**  
   - Used to illustrate “absence of evidence is evidence of absence.” If you thoroughly search a room and find no watch, you can reasonably conclude it’s not there—similar to investigating claims of ghosts or gods.

4. **Ghost-Hunting TV Shows**  
   - References shows that investigate haunted locations with scientific equipment but never find ghosts, demonstrating how thorough investigation can reveal what’s possible or impossible.

5. **Speaker’s Childhood Memories**  
   - Personal stories about growing up in Oklahoma: receiving a Howdy Doody doll (disliked) and a Lone Ranger bicycle (loved), visiting rodeos, and helping his grandfather. These illustrate vivid, emotionally detached recollection.

6. **Grandmother with Alzheimer’s**  
   - A participant shares a story about his grandmother with memory loss who, when met with joy, repeatedly shared wholesome childhood memories. This shows how positive engagement can access buried positive memories.

7. **The Lightning Strike Pianist**  
   - A story about a man who, after being struck by lightning, developed a passion for Chopin and taught himself piano. The speaker uses this to debunk magical thinking, emphasizing that skill came from practice and love of music, not the lightning itself.

8. **Beethoven’s Deafness and Repetition**  
   - Beethoven’s process of repetition and refinement in composition is used as a metaphor for how skills (and memories) are built through consistent practice and focus.

9. **College Exam-Taking**  
   - Contrasts two approaches to learning: anxious note-taking versus paying attention and absorbing material. This parallels meditation practice—being present versus being distracted by past/future worries.

### **Key Themes Linked to Metaphors/Stories**
- **Memory vs. Identity**: Letting go of identifying with memories to find happiness.
- **Possible vs. Impossible**: Distinguishing realistic skills from magical thinking.
- **Emotional Unloading**: Separating memories from the emotions attached to them.
- **Reclaiming Childhood Wonder**: Returning to a state of curiosity and investigation.

These metaphors and stories collectively illustrate the talk’s core message: through mindful practice, we can reorganize our minds, access memories without emotional baggage, and distinguish between attainable skills and impossible fantasies.
