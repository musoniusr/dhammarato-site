### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Predict, interrupt, have a war dance, pee in my corner, that kind of stuff. All right, so welcome to the Sunday afternoon call. It's 4 PM in Thailand time. We've got several friends who are in Thailand. David, You still— I can see the background. You're still at your— I know where you are. In fact, you're still at Wat Suwan Mokkh. How is the Wat Suwan Mokkh?

**Speaker B:** I love it. Can't complain. I got my own room. I mean, no one ever comes in here. It's a dormitory, but no one ever comes in here. So it's nice.

**Speaker A:** It depends upon the time of the year. In fact, in May, it's going to get really crowded. But that was before you moved in. You were over at Wat Khao Tam then?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, May 21st I left Wat Khao Tam and came to Wat Suan Mokkh. May 21st.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yeah. So the first question that we'll talk about has to do with Let us say that Western Buddhism is all over the place. It's all over the place for several reasons. One is that Westerners who have learned the Dharma have learned it from people who were already all over the place, and that there is a specific teaching of the Buddha And that Buddhism is vast, and the teaching of the Buddha is quite small. But that's true also about truth. I mean, non-truth is vast. We have Star Wars and Star Trek.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker A:** Cowboy movies and all kinds of stuff, but the reality is right here, right now. And the easy example of that would be, um, Ross, how old are you?

**Speaker C:** I'm 36.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I ask you again, how old are you? But this time lie to me.

**Speaker D:** Why?

**Speaker C:** Uh, I'm 21.

**Speaker A:** All right, I ask you again, lie to me again.

**Speaker C:** Uh, I'm 65.

**Speaker A:** All right, lie to me again.

**Speaker C:** I'm 142.

**Speaker A:** Now we're going someplace. Lie to me again.

**Speaker C:** Um, I don't know when I was born.

**Speaker A:** Well, neither do I, but they kept records and I believed them. So basically what I'm getting at is, is that the lies or stuff that people make up is vast. And reality is quite narrow. Does anybody have any disagreement with that? The truth is somehow bigger than the lies that we've been telling. All right, so one of the very first, or let us say early, lies that really, really stuck was lies that were in the Visuddhimagga. And one of the things that are in this Vasudhi Marga is, is that they have the idea of 40 meditations. They took a little bit here and a little bit there. They made 10 of the charnel ground meditations, which, by the way, the Buddha abandoned very early in his career and didn't teach it anymore. They put the Brahma Viharas, they put the Jhanas, they put all kinds of stuff in there to count up to 40. Nowadays, when we go to the yoga class, they've got 3 or 4 new meditations. People are making up meditations all over the place, but the Buddha actually only taught one. Does anybody know what the one meditation that the Buddha taught? David, I know you know the answer to that. Anapanasati. Precisely. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in fact got into a lot of trouble in the 1930s, and this is one of the things that he was, let us say, called up to a Sangha dissesa. I don't know what the word would be. A tribunal is 3, but he had 20 judges. And he made that statement that the Buddha only taught one meditation. And boy, did he get a bunch of monks angry. But they did a literature research because he, after all, he was in Bangkok. He was in the Pali capital of the world. They have all kinds of university classes and Pali classes at various schools. And so they sent a whole lot of monks into the Pali And he was proven right. There is no place where there are 40 meditations, but they all have to do with just one. There is only one meditation. And in fact, I would go so far as to say that we've even got a problem by using the word meditation. A better thing to say is that the Buddha only gave one practice, because meditation actually is vast. I imagine you can, um, that you can quote meditations and give instructions on meditations, and I never heard that. Most of the meditations, however, or let us say within a group. An example of that would be meditating on one's big toe, which we often do, especially right after we stump it, or when the toenails have grown so long. And we'll Vipassana around for quite a while. We can call that a meditation. So we can get away from the word meditation and get into the word practice. And that if we are practicing correctly, that means that we're limiting Buddhism and bringing it right back down to the actual teachings of the Buddha. Now, one of the main teachings of the Buddha, in fact the main teaching of the Buddha, has to do with Dukkha and Dukkha-Nirodha. That's really all he taught, was to be able to see the Dukkha so that we could come out of it. And there's many, many different ways that we can have Dukkha. We can have Dukkha in the sense of the thoughts that we have, and we can have Dukkha in the sense of the attitudes that we have. We can have Dukkha in the sense of the body not cooperating and giving us messages we don't want to hear. In fact, we can call those messages pain or just sensations. But the main thing is, is that the basic Dukkha comes from the perspective of the Vedana or the feelings. In other words, if you stump your toe and you like it, then there's no Dukkha there. But if you don't like it, There's the Dukkha. And so we can say that in fact the main problem with Dukkha is that we don't like something. And often when we don't like it, we think that it's a problem to be solved and we start paying a whole lot of attention to it. Who has a cure for a stumped toe? Anybody? We didn't break it, we just stumped it. So we don't have to put it into a cast, and toe casts are interesting things anyway. So does anybody have a cure for a stumped toe?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Change your attitude towards the pain.

**Speaker A:** Actually, yes. Another way of talking about it is that we can distract ourselves. We can go think of something else. And those are very close together because I can change my attitude of, wow, I'm going to watch where I'm going at night, I'm going to start paying attention. So it can be quite a learning process. But ordinary people are going to say something like, well, why did they move the couch? Blame somebody else for the fact that we're not watching where we're going. So the right way to handle things then is to start paying attention to the way we feel and recognize that the way we feel comes from the attitudes that we have, which give rise to the thoughts that we have, and the thoughts are then going to lead to the feelings. And if we can adjust our attitude and adjust our thoughts and adjust our posture from time to time so that we're sitting comfortably, then eventually we'll be able to control our own feelings so that you can feel the way that you want to feel rather than feel the way that you were taught to feel and the way that you grew up haphazardly feeling this and that. This is the actual teachings of the Buddha, and yet look how many different spiritual practices you'll find all over the place. Yoga and meditation. And in fact, that's kind of interesting about yoga. The women get all kind of bent out of shape, but they like it because they can bend themselves out of shape. But then when their husband comes home, they get really bent out of shape in a completely different way. And so yoga, in fact, is not a liberating practice. Most of the practices of meditation in all the various current forms and kinds of meditation is not liberating. What is liberating is the ability to make the change, to come out of the unwholesome thoughts into the wholesome, to come out of our unwholesome attitudes into the wholesome attitudes, to start to have some influence on the way that we feel so that we can feel the way that we want to feel. Mikey, if you could feel the way that you wanted to feel, how would you feel right now?

**Speaker F:** I would feel just fine.

**Speaker D:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Do you feel just fine right now? Oh yeah. Okay, well then, that's all there is to it. Is you can feel the way that you want to feel. And over time, as you can recognize, you can feel or want to feel various things. And so you're not hooked on— when I ask you right now, how do you want to feel, that doesn't fix it for all time. It fixes it only for this moment, and the next moment you want to feel differently. So, uh, Ross, this is in the direction of the question that you asked. I would say that the reason that Buddhism is so vast is because people make stuff up and have been for centuries, and calling that the teachings of the Buddha, or actually just call it Buddhism. So in fact, I would like for myself and up to you, can take the word Buddhism and give it to those people who claim that that's what they are. I might in fact call them Vinayas, that's a new word, but the better word to use for the teachings of the Buddha would be just that, the teachings of the Buddha or the Buddha Dhamma. Or maybe just Dharma. That we can say would be the teaching of the Buddha, as opposed to Buddhism all over the place. Like Metta and Karuna and Mudita and Upekkha and Tantras and Toku and Mandalas and Bodhisattva ideals and Mahayana Bhikkhuni and all kinds of stuff have been made up over a period of time, and very little of that stuff is liberating. And the only stuff that is liberating is when it actually conforms back to this change model. And in fact, one of the systems that is easy to pick on is what is referred to in Western Buddhism as Mahasi. The noting technique. Why does Mahasi Method not liberate? Is because they note the Dukkha and then note it again and then note it again until they get themselves all discombobulated into fear, misery, disgust. Everything is falling apart and it's not liberating. It's only liberating when they change their way of doing things. Instead of just noting the garbage in the mind, let's note it well and let it pass. Note it well and make a change. So, Carl, you got your hand up.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was going to add, while you said Metta and they split the practice here in London, I go to a Buddhist center, doesn't matter which one, but that's what exactly what they do when they teach meditation is they have it split. They will teach you mindfulness and concentration one day, and then the other day they will teach you Metta. And I found it completely backwards because one day you're just noting and you're just sitting there in pretty much Dukkha or counting your breaths, and then the next day you're trying to apply the same concentration you learned into objects like people, worlds, like happiness in the whole world or happiness for other people. But nothing.

**Speaker A:** There's no happiness in the meditation hall.

**Speaker D:** Nothing to do with you. Exactly, exactly. Nothing to do with you. Just like same old. And they repeat these practices instead of combining two of them. That's why I find it like super bizarre.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. I have seen that practice. I've been part of that kind of a practice to where they go from one kind of dukkha to another kind of dukkha. And then they practice two kinds of Dukkha they call meditations, and neither one of them are liberating. There's just more Dukkha there. Okay, Deidre, you got your hand up for a long time.

**Speaker E:** Yes, thank you.

**Speaker A:** I see you're wearing your choir robe again.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, no, I am. About the stumped toe again. Sorry to bring it up.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's get stumped on that one.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that's it. So the mind is the forerunner, you always say. So it starts in the mind and then you feel something. That's how I got it. Maybe that. So if you stump your toe, there's not much thought before you really feel pain. But then If I get it right, then you get your thoughts about your toe being stumped. That's where you can add the practice of meditation of saying, well, I have control over my thoughts. I can take this in another attitude or think differently about it. Is that correct?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Let me fill in something with that. There is a story in the sutta In fact, there are several times that the Buddha mentioned a tender young infant, and on one of these suttas he talks about, imagine that someone touched the hand of a tender young infant with a hot coal, okay? And that hot coal then is going to be responded to by the infant by withdrawing the hand. You can imagine that too, that you've Let us say that you burned yourself with a lighter or you put your hand on a hot stove. The hand is smarter than the brain. The hand will withdraw before the brain does. And then the pain sets in is when we begin to think about the sensation of the hand after it's been burned. So the baby will withdraw their hand first. And then start to cry. That's an important point. Think about that, that the hand is smarter than the baby's brain. The same thing with us too, that we— the hand will withdraw and then we cry. Why? Because it takes the mind a little bit of time to process it, but the hand can be very quick.

**Speaker E:** So what is that that takes the hand so fast away? Intuition?

**Speaker A:** It's the fact that you've got neurons, you've got receptors right there in the hand, that not all of the hand movements that you have come from orders from the brain. It's almost like thinking about an army to where you've got generals, but you've got lieutenants and you've got squad leaders, and a lot of the decisions are made by the squad leaders and even the Anapanasati, infantrymen themselves, and it never gets back up to the general. Okay, so that's the reason why, is because the local sensations, that part of the brain that's actually the neurons that are in the hand all the way up to the arm, so that the hand is going to withdraw, that the wrist is going to withdraw, the arm is going to withdraw, and all of that happens before the brain even knows and the pain comes later.

**Speaker E:** And then you go to the process of, okay, your hand is withdrawn and then you feel pain and then you can add the practice like you practiced meditation.

**Speaker A:** Right. We can say I'll be okay. We can have a lot of thoughts, but most of the time when when the sensation starts, the first thing that happens is that we call it pain. We might say ouch and cry out, right? Why is that? Because the mind now has been burned. Why does the mind have to burn? Because the hand was burned. Okay, that's the way that we That was the way that we started out. And tender infants do it that way. The hand is burned, they withdraw the hand, and then they'll ball up and cry. Isn't that the way that we do it too? Somebody says something to us and we withdraw like that, and then we start thinking about it and we get all unhappy.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. So it's actually the same reaction is also in like in human relations or whatever, you get the same reaction. Like somebody says something hurtful and immediately you want to withdraw and then you.

**Speaker A:** Start— And then we start having all of those thoughts, those unwholesome thoughts that come in afterwards after we recognize that we have been insulted. To where just the loud noise. Okay, so this is the way that we can then begin to practice is how fast is the mind to be able to come into play? Does it have to have that long? Let us say as long as 300, maybe 400 milliseconds for a tender infant. It may be half a second or longer because their brain's not fully developed. To where, let us say, in a martial arts bout, and this guy throws a punch, the martial artist is going to respond to that before he gets kicked. All right, can we do that mentally when somebody argues with us or somebody insults us? Can we withdraw from that and stay withdrawn and not ever get hit with it? Okay, so here's an important point, and I'll make this, but I want to get to Anna's question because this goes back to the question that Amrit was asking, and that is, is that the hand got burned But the baby didn't start to cry until they made the connection, it's my hand. That's me that burns. And that's when we really don't like it, that in fact that perceptual process that we go through that brings the concept of I, me, and mine into it. This is why the Buddha was talking about, first off, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is what he really teaches. But one of the ways that we find Dukkha is by owning it, by identifying with it. So when somebody insults, you can just see an insult, you can step right out of the way, but we get pain when we stand up and become the target and says, that's me he's insulting. And a better thought to have would be, wow, he's throwing insults at people he doesn't even know. He missed me. There's no me there to hit. So Anna, go ahead, you've got a question long-standing now. By the way, so glad to see you.

**Speaker G:** Yes. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker G:** So I've got a question or something to say about yoga. So, you know, yoga is part of my practice, and I found some compatibilities with the practice of the Buddha, actually, which are like you practice some posture but you practice them consciously, like in the Mahasati Patthana Sutta. And also, if you use breathing techniques, or only breathing, you know, simply breathing while doing your posture is also a way to practice Anapanasati while moving your body, you know, and just relaxing and being aware of the movement that you are doing and the sensation that you have in your body and seeing the reaction of your mind and change them Whenever you need to change them while moving your body. So I don't know what you think about it, but like, this is the way I practice yoga, actually.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here, let's start with this. The Buddha was very big on walking. He walked everywhere he went, and he walked every day of Prapendabhat. And that one of the kind of terms that we use when about walking is one stretches one's legs. We get them flexible, we move around when we're walking. All right. Now, the whole point about yoga is that you're not walking. You're sitting still, you're in one place. Now here's the reason why yoga got started. In the really, really old days in India, thousands of years ago, they didn't have furniture. Furniture was invented in Europe when it got cold, to get your butt off the ground. But the sitting on the ground had been common for humanity for many, many centuries. And that then yoga was the ability to just stay on the ground and start to stretch. Now, there's actually the point would be that meditation in the form of sitting practice predated the Buddha for centuries. That the rishis and the Wanderers sat around, and many of them were what they would call cave dwellers. And it was the ones who were in the caves who invented yoga in the sense of, let's stretch the body rather than having to leave the cave. Especially since between here and the entrance to the cave may be a whole nest of snakes. Let's just sit here. And so this is how yoga got started. It was a sense of let's stretch our legs. And now in modern yoga, there's no end to it. There's just no end to it. They want to stretch everything, get everything all bent out of shape. But the entire original position was to be able to stretch your legs and come out of the sitting posture. And then after the legs were relaxed.

**Speaker G:** You feel good, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So you can get out of the posture, stretch your legs, and then get back into the posture. And that would be the yoga. But yoga, also you heard probably words like bhakti yoga, kriya yoga, that kind of stuff. Is the word yoga actually does not mean what they do on a yoga mat at yoga halls in the West. That yoga actually used is the word for work, and it is closely aligned with the word yoke in the sense of what you would put on a horse or a cow to have them pull a plow. So the word yoga actually has the quality of work to it, but the original yoga was merely just to stretch the legs. And now look how far they've taken it.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, um, but the problem is, is that yoga teachers are trying to do two things. They're trying to get their body fit, and there's no end to what fit means. And they're trying to make some money out of it, too. Well, there's a third reason, and that is that all the young ladies in the yoga class get to visit the teacher privately, and there's those kind of things going on. But yoga and modern-day yoga has gotten quite complicated. To where in fact the original yoga was merely stretching the legs. So Ross, you got your hand up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I suppose what Anna was saying there was kind of getting to part of what my question was about.

**Speaker E:** In.

**Speaker C:** That can you practice in different ways, in different situations, use that part of your deliberate practice like daily. It's like something I do similar to yoga in the morning just to get my body feeling less stiff, but I use that deliberately, like use my breath and kind of use that to kind of feel, I suppose, more whole, like have more wholesome thoughts and things like that.

**Speaker A:** But like, you just stole my line. I was going to talk about that, and that is, is that while you're doing the yoga practice, that's the time to practice yoga in the mind too, to stretch your mind out of the unwholesome unwholesome thoughts into the wholesome.

**Speaker C:** Yes, I think, like, can we have more of a deliberate daily practice that's not just the four postures, like the sitting, standing, walking, reclining? Can we have more movement? Can we, like, have a deliberate practice, like cleaning, like sweeping the floor? Is that, like, does that count? But also, well, I think just that for now. There's probably a little bit more. That was going to ask as well.

**Speaker A:** It's interesting that you would mention sweeping, because the Buddha mentioned the sweeping in the sense that when the young monk is sweeping the temple— and the sweeping, by the way, is an old, old practice that predates the Buddha. In India, they didn't have streets or roads. All they had was paths, and most always the paths were through the woods. Which means that on the path, if you've got leaves falling out of the trees, there's all kinds of stuff that are going to be on the path. Sometimes it's even hard to see where the path is if it hadn't been walked on. So the idea then of brushing the path with a broom predated the Buddha. And so he talks about that, that when the young monk is there sweeping the path to get the leaves out of the way and also the frogs, the snakes, the worms and other things like that, that his mind is on the Dharma, not on the sweeping. So the same thing then would be true about the yoga practice, the stretching of the body, or whatever activity that you've got going. The real intention is, can you keep coming back to the Dharma? Can you keep coming back to the reality of the moment that, wow, the Dharma is really great? Wow, the Dhamma is liberating. Wow, I can hear what's going on inside my head and I can be free from it. So paying attention to the Dharma over and over and over again is something that that young monk would do while he's sweeping. And in your case, while you're doing the yoga, you can have that idea of, is this yoga position wholesome? Or am I stretching too far? And is the thought that I'm having about what my desires are about the yoga postures, are they wholesome? In other words, am I merely doing this yoga for the relaxation and the stretching of the body in a wholesome way, or am I trying to be one of those super duper yoga teachers that's got to go all through many hundreds of postures and put your videos on YouTube to show how flexible you are. So it becomes an ego trip. This is no longer stretching the body. This is me stretching my body. There's where that selfishness comes in. And so having thoughts of the Dharma, like everything is good, everything is fine, I'm not trying to compete with myself or other people in these postures that I'm putting myself into. I'm merely doing the yoga for relaxation, for stretching. Does that make sense for you, Ross?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think just do a bit is just those things that I suppose a lot of Asian people do in temples, like prostrations and lighting incense and chanting. Things like that. Do you think they're valid as long as you have the same approach?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the whole point, is that we do those rituals hopefully in the sense of getting the mind together. But most people, uh, let us say it, generally in Christianity, the ritual is more important than the mind state because the ritual is done for God's benefit, not for your own. And so most rituals then get into doing the ritual perfectly and fussing at other people because they don't know the exact words and things like that, to where the real point about the ritual is, can the ritual help you get into the frame of mind? But in fact, the ritual of the morning and evening chanting that they do they do in the Theravada temples, the 20 minutes of chanting in the morning is to get the monks focused on the Dharma that they're chanting, which means many of them are going to have to learn some Pali so that they actually know what they're saying rather than knowing how to say it. And when one starts to contemplate and work with the Dharma that they're reciting, then they can sit with a mind that's already empty and they can go into Jhana just like that. As opposed to Westerners who have to work at getting the mind emptied out. And so I would say that, you know, let's go bizarre on that. If you could sing Jesus Loves Me, This I Know 50 times and then sit in meditation, you'd be better off than just sitting in meditation. Why? Because focusing on the words and the language and the song that you're singing— this is one of the reasons why musicians make very good spiritual teachers, is because they're already able to keep their mind focused on a piece of music. So can you do that while you're sweeping Can you do that while you're stretching? Is to keep your mind focused on the Dharma. Deitri, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I just want to make a remark about the yoga. I've been practicing yoga for 30 years now. I always understood that yoga is a preparation, a ritual before going into meditation.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly so. That's the right attitude precisely. But on YouTube, the postures, that's what it's all about. Can the girl get into those difficult postures? Okay, so let's now move on to Amrit's original question. Because this is what we've been preparing for, is to talk about the various suttas where we talk about the five aggregates. Yoga is a really good one to introduce because that's generally the body. And that what our society teaches is I am the body. Look how many industries we have that are associated with I am the body. I mean Gucci, Revlon, Max Factor, fashion industries, and in fact in many ways sports, and the same thing would be true then with medicine, that almost all the visits to the doctor is because of the thought of, "Oh, poor me!" That if people only went to the doctor when they actually needed the doctor, we wouldn't need so many doctors, we wouldn't have so many hospitals. Most of the people with visits to the doctor are unnecessary. I've even seen a very short clip on YouTube of House, Dr. House, where he walks into the waiting room there and he says, does anybody here have a cold? Anybody got a sniffle? Anybody have hard breathing? And people would raise their hand. He says, fine, go home. You don't need to be at the doctor's office. But people will go to the doctor. To be honest with you, my mother was a first-class hypochondriac. She'd go to the doctor at the drop of a hat. Our family didn't have money because of the medical bills that she'd run up. She used to take me to the doctor, and I would wonder, what's the point? If I break my leg, I want the doctor to set it in a cast. But if my leg is not broken, I don't need a doctor. But when people attach to the body and there's any aches and pains, I mean, look at the crisis in the medication system where people are on fentanyl and their own opioids and all of that is because they're afraid of their body. And the doctors will make a huge profit off of them by giving them medications that they don't need. So the right thing to do is to pay close attention to your body so that you will know whether you need help with it or not, rather than going to the doctor because, oh, poor me. And so much of the Society that we live in is built around attachments to the body, whether it's amusement parks, or all associated especially with the thrill rides. People want thrills in the body. They want self— they want— let's just say this, this way— they want safe terror. That's why we go to horror movies. The kids love horror movies. Why? Is because it's not real horror. It's a safe kind of horror, but they can feel horrified anyway safely. They like those feelings in the body. And that this is one of the points that the Buddha made, is that there are actually five aggregates. We have the body, and with the body we have consciousness. The body knows we have eyes, ears, et cetera, like that. And so we associate then with the body, oh, these are my eyes and this is what I see. This is what I hear with my ears. And so we attach strongly to our consciousness, so much so that we want to be conscious even after death. The Christians can do without a body, but they can't do without that consciousness. I mean, what's the point of going to heaven if you don't know it? What's the point of being in hell if you don't know you're there? And so this is the point of consciousness. And the Buddha says, pay very close attention because consciousness is dependently arising. Sometimes you're conscious, sometimes you're not. Sometimes you're ear-conscious and you're eye-conscious, and then you're back and forth. And sometimes you're not conscious at all about what's going on in the outside world because you're playing with your own windmill of the mind. And that's all you're conscious. So recognizing that you're conscious of various things, and sometimes like when you're asleep or on opioids or whatever, you're not conscious at all. If we can understand that, then we can see that consciousness is dependently arising, and it is not me, it's not you. It's just consciousness. So we have the body, the consciousness, then we have several more. One is perception. An example of that is my thoughts. I think this, therefore these are my thoughts, and because they're mine and I'm a good person, my thoughts must be true. In fact, the reality is almost every thought that you have, every thought that you've ever had, you borrowed from someone else. Very rarely does a human have an original thought. Get over it! The thoughts that I'm having and the thoughts that I'm teaching in this class and on Skype today, they're not original, they don't belong to me. This is stuff that I've learned from other places. So, we attach to our our perception. We attach to our consciousness. Another thing that we attach to is our past. We attach to the past in the sense of that's who I am, our identity. And one of the things that's built into our past is all the rules, all the woulds, shoulds, coulds, ideals, everything that you've learned that you can think about It doesn't belong to you. A good easy way to see that is when you're dead, what kind of thoughts, what kind of perception are you going to have? What kind of past does a dead man have? For him, he's dead, he doesn't have a past. But the people who read books about him, they have his past, but he doesn't. He's dead. So When our perception, when our consciousness, when our perception and thoughts and our past are not ours, guess what? There's one more, and that our feelings are not ours. And yet we attach probably to our feelings more than anything else. We put it into our language, like, "I feel sad, I feel sick, I feel tired, I feel—" I feel frustrated, I feel anxious, I feel uptight. All of these feelings, by the way, are almost always based in negative feelings associated with fear. Very rarely do we go around saying, "Whoopi, I'm happy. Wow, everything is okay." We have to actually practice that because that's not part of our habit system. This is why the Buddha teaches that, that we have to start practicing wholesome thoughts, because wholesome thoughts by their very nature are not selfishly oriented. And yet everything that we've been doing all of this time is associating ourselves with the body, the feelings, the thoughts, the perceptions, our past, and our consciousness. Always I, me, mine. I always— I, me, mine. And these five That don't belong to us. And so we have to practice having wholesome thoughts. We have to build up a new memory system, get rid of the old one because it's delusional. We were delusioned when we saw it. We delusioned when we stored it. We delusioned over time with it just sitting there. And then when we remember it and pull it out of our memory, we bring it out in delusion. So we're not very good at remembering things. But when we do, we almost always go to the point of, "It's my memory, it's my past, my grandfather, my this, my grandfather's house." Mickey knows what that joke is about. And the fact is, is that none of that stuff belongs to us. Can we practice being in the here now? Because that's all you really do have. So, Arhat, did you get the point about the 5 aggregates? They're not me, they're not you. They're just part of reality. When we attach to them, that's Dukkha. Go ahead.

**Speaker H:** I'm saying, yeah, conceptually I do the— I understand it. But if somebody insult me now, I would be upset for a while. So it will take quite a while to keep reminding myself, oh, this was not me.

**Speaker A:** Right. So why don't you start practicing reminding yourself that it's not you, so that when that insult comes, we are already well skilled at, "That's not me he's fussing about. That's not me he's criticizing. He's criticizing something out of his own mind." For instance, on Reddit they say, "Dhammarato, you don't know the Dharma." Well, the Dhammarato he's complaining about is the Dhammarato in his head. He doesn't know this Dhammarato because this Dhammarato doesn't even know this Dhammarato. It's a moving target. This is also a good point to point out: the Buddha was actually calling the first better, was personality view. And what is the personality view? The personality view is that I am. I am this and I am that, and the next time I say it, I am this and I am that, and it's kind of permanent. But the Buddha says everything is temporary. Anicca, what is Sankhara? Everything is temporary, including your personality. That over time your personality changes. When you were 2 years old, your personality was one way. When you were 5 years old, you were 8 years old, it was something else. When you were 10 years old, it was something else. When you were 14, wow, did your personality change. And we don't even recognize those personality changes. We think I am me, where in fact, look at the fact that the me that you were is not the me who you are now. And what the— and the me that you are now is only on the way to some next me, and it doesn't stop. But the Christianity in our culture teaches about a soul. For instance, if you did something wrong 5 years ago, we can punish you for it now because the one who did it 5 years ago is the same person that we caught this time. And after we catch you and put you in jail for a year and then give you a trial, and then after the trial they put you in prison and Everybody thinks it's the same person, but it's not. The personality is constantly changing. For instance, on the stand when the judge is giving him the sentence, he could be very remorseful, but when he gets into prison, he's not going to be remorseful anymore. He's going to start screaming, "I'm innocent! I'm innocent!" So if you recognize that you're a moving target, this will be very helpful, Amrit, to start seeing when you're sitting there moment by moment by moment, the Amrit that had this thought is not the Amrit that has the next thought. That Amrit is just a concept. And the reality is, is things are always in motion, always in flux. For that reason, how could you possibly own the body? Because the body is out of control. Oh, let's play a game. Deidre, if you were the age you wanted to be, what age would you be? You?

**Speaker E:** I would be the age I have now.

**Speaker A:** All right, but you haven't— you didn't think that before. In fact, you made that up right here on the spot. You're trying to be cheeky with me.

**Speaker E:** Well, let's say I would like my mind to have the same age. I would prefer my body to be a little bit younger.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, why is it the young people want to be older and older people want to be younger? And can you see that that's the personality change? You're not the same person.

**Speaker E:** No, I would like to have my same mind, but the body can be 25 years younger. That would be nice.

**Speaker A:** I don't even— I would— I don't care whether I remember everything or not. That's the funny thing about those who no longer take their memory as important wind up having a really good one. And those who think that their memory is important as my memory, they wind up making a bunch of stuff up instead of recognizing that it wasn't Beard Street at all, it was Dill Street. Mikey knows that joke too.

**Speaker E:** That's where Grandma's house lives.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, actually, exactly. That's the whole point. Actually, Grandpa lived at the corner of Wallace and Park, and we lived at the corner of Dillon and Park, but I grew up thinking that it was Beard Street. So now that I can look at the map and see that Google probably knows more about Shawnee, Oklahoma, than I remember 50 years ago, I'll just take it for granted that, hey, memory is what we want it to be. It's a, you know, it's a mess. We don't remember things the way that we want to remember it. It takes work, or actually it takes repetitive work. I've seen somebody on the internet say, on our Skype group, that strength strength comes from having to put up weight, that you have to have tension. And the answer to that is no. Strength comes from repetition. OK, how do the bodybuilders get strong? Is because they do it over and over and over and over again. They're in the gym all the time. Pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping. That's the repetition, that they can yank or jerk 300 kilograms only because they've been repping and repping and repping with smaller weights for a long period of time. So, let's take that as an example, that when you guys, the Dhamma dudes who are out in the world lifting the heavy weights of other people being attached to you, Recognizing that we needed to do those reps in our own mental gem. That's where we do the reps over and over and over again. This is not me, this is not mine. Wow, everything is nice, everything is okay. And we start practicing the Dhamma over and over and over and over and over again. And when we do that, Then when the trials and tribulations from this society come up, it's, "What, me? That wasn't me. What, me worry?" Let's all become the Alfred D. Newman that we've got inside, that we're not going to worry about anything. While we're practicing, we practice not being worried so that when the reality comes up in the world, We can handle that too, but we have to practice over and over and over again. You've heard me say that over and over and over again. We have to keep practicing, put in those reps. This is not me, this is not mine, this is not my body, this is not my feelings. When I say I don't like it, oops, there's just not liking there. It's not my not liking. So this is the practice, Amrit. This is the way that we practice that it's not mine. Why? Because when it is mine, that's going to bring the Dukkha. But when you see all the politics and everything going on is not my business, then you're good. But if you make things your business, you're going to suffer. You're going to be disappointed. You're going to be unhappy because the things that you own, you don't really own. That's a lie. For instance, how many millions of people say, 'I'm a Democrat,' and how many other millions say, 'I'm a Republican'? Guess what? None of those people run the party. It doesn't belong to them. They can't say, 'I am a Republican.' even the Republicans who were in charge, it's not theirs. So the better thing to say is that those political parties, those countries, those governments are not mine. When I was in high school, we had to play the music and everybody would sing the song, "This is my country." And I would stand up and I would say, it's not. You don't own this place. You don't own it. It's not yours. Don't say I am an American. Better thing to say is, well, there's an American passport somewhere around here. Or in Dietrich's case, a Swedish passport.

**Speaker E:** Dutch. Dutch passport.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker E:** Dutch. I'm from the Netherlands.

**Speaker A:** Netherlands. Okay.

**Speaker E:** Rick's mom, like Daniel's the friend of Rick.

**Speaker A:** Well, never mind. Well, see, it doesn't matter because you don't belong to either one of those countries, nor Do you own any of them? But we have to remember that, because we have been taught that you are this and you are that. So, let's go ahead and finish this. Does anybody have any final things to say? I notice that Anna has had enough of this. She's had about as much joy as she can stand. David, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** You mentioned like these super duper yoga teachers that get into crazy postures. Do you think it's possible to do these postures without that sense of selfishness, that attachment to the body and all that?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I don't think so, but I don't know because I haven't done that. I haven't been there and I haven't done that. But I do know that when I was a kid and playing the piano, it was always me playing the piano. So for the idea then of those guys who were doing those super duper yoga postures, yeah, I mean, why would they bother to do it if it wasn't me doing I don't have to. They're not mine. I don't need to show off. So I would say that it's really difficult, and almost always there is that attachment. That's why they keep pushing themselves. Sometimes they push themselves into breaking things, stretching too much, because they want too much. And that wanting is always selfish. People push themselves into all kinds of things because they want something. And if you don't want anything, then you come to an end of Kamma. That's what we talked about yesterday. Is the end of action is when you don't want anything, you stop behaving. So if that yoga teacher didn't want anything, then he'd probably stop practicing. He would, let us say, stop pushing himself and just practice the things that he can already do. Because he enjoys doing it.

**Speaker B:** But perhaps that yoga practitioner enjoys doing these crazy postures.

**Speaker A:** No? And the first time he did that crazy posture, he couldn't get into it exactly correct, and so he had to push himself into it. The body was saying, oh no, I don't go there. So yeah, all of the— when you mentioned crazy postures, in order to get into those crazy postures the first few times, that's ego.

**Speaker E:** Can I make a remark?

**Speaker A:** Yes, please do.

**Speaker E:** I think it's really actually a bit crazy to make yoga into a competition, because as I said before, yoga is really like—.

**Speaker A:** Originally, yeah, it's relaxation, isn't it? That's what the whole point of yoga is, is to relax. And yet these guys in these crazy postures are not relaxed.

**Speaker E:** Why? Why should you compete with that? It's really— well, anyway, that's just who I am.

**Speaker A:** It's, it's the selfishness. It's the I am. I'm the one who can do that posture. I want congratulations. I want a video. I want to get paid. I want in Guinness Book of World Records, that kind of stuff. Carl, you raised your hand.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say it's just the same thing as meditations. The more meditations you can develop, the more attention you can get, the more postures you can get into, the more clients you can get. It's the same thing for all of it.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's why I'm going back to what Ross asked originally. The reason why Buddhism has developed into this huge, vast thing is because of all the egos that have been put into it. Where the original teaching to the Buddha was to come out of the ego. And there's some very simple practices to do that, but we have to do it over and over and over again. And yoga is all about doing all kinds of things. You get one yoga posture, now you got to do another one. There's no end to the yoga postures. The question would be— the actual question is, can you be free from suffering? And you see that you drive yourself into crazy postures. And now I'm not talking about just yoga postures. Look how many different crazy positions we put ourselves in. Amrit, you got your hand up.

**Speaker H:** So yeah, just a quick question for you, Dhammarato. So now they are developing all kinds of instruments which can measure your brainwaves. I think at some point they would be able to see whether in Jhana 1, Jhana 2, and you think there would be a competition then also? For meditators.

**Speaker A:** They will have to define what Jhana is though, and they don't even know. Nobody knows what Jhana is.

**Speaker H:** I think they are doing some— I was reading there's some research and they try to use this brain activity to see what state your brain is in. And Sankhara, one of our Mahayana teaching, so he is quite big into it. So he's also working with some researchers to develop these instruments. I think there could be like an Olympic level competition for meditators as well.

**Speaker A:** Is Jonas still here? He had a— yeah, he's still here. Jonas, I want to answer one little question for you because what we've been talking about actually is quite pertinent, and that is, is that when other people are attached to you They cannot be attached to you. That's the you. And that when you see them attaching to you, that's your ego more than theirs. They can attach to you on their end of it, but that doesn't bother you. It's okay with you that they attach. Can you be not attached to them attaching?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think like this might be the better question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, how to let go of other people's attachment and expectations of us? And the best thing to do is, is that just be friendly with them. In a non-competitive, happy way. Just everything's okay. So anybody else got any small things to say before we leave? I'm really glad to see you all here. Thank you for coming.

**Speaker E:** I'm so glad to see you again, Dhammarato, up and running again. It's really nice. Yes, I don't know, it doesn't make any difference, but I still send out a little prayer for your health, and maybe it helped a little bit, or maybe you felt it. Never mind.

**Speaker A:** Maybe it made you feel good.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. And maybe it's why I'm like a priest.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right. Ross, did you get out of this what you wanted to get out of it?

**Speaker C:** I always get out of it what I want out of it. It's just staying in the Dharma, reminding myself of what needs to be done. I think it's just, yeah, it's always every day trying to do what I can to keep myself thinking about Dharma, and it works.

**Speaker A:** All right. So Mikey, why don't you take it from here?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it's been a splendid call today. I was reminded of Majjhimanakaya 28, the great elephant footprint simile. So if y'all are into reading suttas, go check that one out after this call. And if you haven't yet, check out opensanghafoundation.org, and even if you have checked it out, give it another look. We've been updating it every day, making little improvements here and there, improving the navigation and the look of the site, and it's really come together into a useful tool for practitioners, and it's a great place for people to make friends and talk with one another and find wats.

**Speaker A:** Finding places close to you. Yes. Finding wats, finding facilities. We've got more than 6,000 places.

**Speaker F:** And I'd also like to add that if you know of a wat that you've been to and it's not on our site, there is the option to add a facility You can find that on the search page. So go ahead and add a facility. And the more facilities we have, the better. We already have thousands, but just makes it easier for people to find places near them.

**Speaker A:** I want them all. I want them all. Even the ones that closed down.

**Speaker F:** So yeah, thank you all for being here today. It's so good to see so many happy friends.

**Speaker A:** Thank you all so much, guys. Patrick, we'll see you later.

**Speaker H:** See you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Theme: Simplifying the Dharma**
The talk centers on the idea that true Buddhist practice (the Buddha's actual teaching) is simple and focused, in contrast to the vast, complicated, and often fabricated "Buddhism" found in the West and elsewhere.

### **Main Points:**

1.  **One True Practice:** Dhammarato asserts that the Buddha taught only **one core practice: Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing)**. He references Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's controversial stance on this, noting that concepts like "40 meditation objects" (from the Visuddhimagga) are later additions and distortions.

2.  **The Problem of "Vast" Buddhism:** Western Buddhism is "all over the place" because it has been learned from sources that are already diluted. People constantly invent new techniques (like countless yoga poses or noting practices) that stray from the liberating core.

3.  **The Essence of the Dharma:** The Buddha's fundamental teaching is about **Dukkha (suffering/stress) and its cessation (Dukkha-Nirodha)**.
    *   Dukkha primarily arises from our **attitudes and thoughts** about feelings (*vedanā*). For example, pain becomes suffering when we react with dislike ("I don't want this").
    *   The **liberating practice** is the ability to **change**—to shift from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts and attitudes, thereby gaining control over how we feel. The goal is to feel well *now*.

4.  **Critique of Popular Methods:**
    *   **Mahasi "Noting" Technique:** It often fails to liberate because it merely notes dukkha without actively changing the underlying mindset.
    *   **Split Practices (e.g., Mindfulness one day, Metta the next):** This is seen as disjointed and ineffective if it doesn't lead to personal, liberating change in the present moment.
    *   **Modern Yoga:** While originally a simple preparation for meditation (stretching to sit comfortably), it has become an ego-driven, competitive, and endless pursuit of physical feats, which is not liberating.

5.  **The Five Aggregates & Non-Self (*Anattā*):** The discussion uses yoga as a gateway to explain the five aggregates (*khandhas*)—form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. We create dukkha by **clinging** to these aggregates as "me" or "mine."
    *   The body, feelings, thoughts, memories, and consciousness are **impersonal, temporary processes**. Suffering arises when we identify with them ("my pain," "my thought," "my achievement").
    *   The practice is to repeatedly remind ourselves, "This is not me, this is not mine," to see the **impermanent, ownerless nature** of all experience.

6.  **Practical Application:**
    *   **Daily Life as Practice:** Any activity (sweeping, yoga, walking) can be part of the practice if done with the mind focused on the Dharma—cultivating wholesome thoughts and letting go of "I, me, mine."
    *   **Repetition is Key:** Just as a bodybuilder builds strength through reps, we build mental freedom by repeatedly practicing wholesome thoughts and the perspective of non-self.
    *   **Handling Insults:** With practice, one can see an insult as words directed at a mental projection, not at the ever-changing, non-self reality. The skill is to not "stand up and become the target."

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a call to return to the simple, transformative core of the Buddha's teaching: use mindfulness of breathing to observe the mind, understand the origin of dukkha in clinging, and actively cultivate wholesome mental states to achieve liberation here and now. The vast array of modern techniques are often distractions fueled by ego, competition, and commercialism, unlike the direct path to freedom from suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (Dhammarato) to illustrate his points:

### **Metaphors**
1. **“War dance, pee in my corner”** – Used humorously at the start to describe territorial or aggressive human behaviors, setting the stage for discussing ego and attachment.
2. **“Star Wars and Star Trek… Cowboy movies”** – Represents the vastness of fiction and non-truth, contrasted with the narrowness of reality/Dhamma.
3. **“The hand is smarter than the brain”** – Illustrates how physical reflexes (like pulling a hand from a hot coal) happen before mental processing, analogous to how we often react emotionally before applying mindful awareness.
4. **“Generals, lieutenants, squad leaders, infantrymen”** – A military metaphor explaining decentralized nervous system responses vs. central conscious control.
5. **“Lifting weights / doing reps in the mental gym”** – Compares mental training (repetition of wholesome thoughts) to physical weightlifting for building strength through repetition.
6. **“Safe terror”** – Describes horror movies and thrill rides as ways people seek controlled, ego-driven sensations.
7. **“A moving target”** – Represents the ever-changing nature of personality and self, which cannot be permanently owned or fixed.
8. **“Yoke”** – Explains the original meaning of “yoga” as work or a yoke linking effort to outcome, not just physical postures.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **“How old are you? Now lie to me.”** – A quick interactive story with Ross to show that lies/fabrications are endless, but truth (reality) is singular and narrow.
2. **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the “40 meditations” controversy** – The story of Buddhadasa being tried by a sangha tribunal for claiming the Buddha taught only one meditation (ānāpānasati), and how research proved him right.
3. **Stumping your toe** – A recurring example to explore pain, reaction, attitude change, and non-identification with sensation.
4. **Baby touching a hot coal** – A sutta-based story showing how physical withdrawal precedes crying, illustrating the gap between sensation and mental suffering.
5. **Young monk sweeping the path** – A story from the suttas where sweeping is done with the mind on Dhamma, not on the action, illustrating mindfulness in daily activities.
6. **Dr. House in the waiting room** – A pop-culture reference to critique unnecessary attachment to the body and hypochondria.
7. **“This is my country” / nationality** – A personal anecdote about rejecting identifications like “I am an American” to illustrate non-ownership.
8. **Grandma’s house / misremembered street names** – A lighthearted story highlighting the unreliability of memory and the constructed nature of personal history.
9. **Yoga postures as ego competition** – A critique of modern yoga as an ego-driven pursuit of difficult postures for show, contrasted with its original purpose as preparatory stretching for meditation.

### **Purpose of These Metaphors & Stories**
They serve to:
- Simplify complex Dhamma concepts (like anattā, dukkha, and anicca).
- Criticize modern, diluted, or commercialized forms of Buddhism and meditation.
- Emphasize core teachings: one practice (ānāpānasati), changing unwholesome thoughts, and non-identification with the five aggregates.
- Encourage repetitive mental training (“reps”) to break habitual selfish patterns.
