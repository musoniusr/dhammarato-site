### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I would never recommend anyone go against what they think they need to do by going to a doctor. I would never recommend somebody, oh, don't go to the doctor because of blah blah. That if you want to go to the doctor, that's the thing to do. I would never want to interfere. If some— if a doctor has given somebody medication and they ask me about it, I would say what I've said to you in the sense of become your own physician. But now do your own monitoring, figure out for sure what effects that medication has upon you. So, Brian, we got started talking about medicine and medical science because of a recent visit that you had to the doctor, and that we were discussing the fact that mysticism and medicine have been interrelated for many centuries. That in fact, you could say that practical medicine, or absolutely accurate working medicine, scientifically based, was originally shamanism that just happened to have worked. And because it did, the shamans kept doing it. Eventually the shamans got an educational system going. They started making some rules. But all along there is always this mystical side, or some people can call it the magical side of medicine, that is there. An example of that, and we can get into it a little bit deeper. That when you know what the problem is, then we know generally what the solution is. For instance, if the arm is broken, then you want to set it. And if it is a compound fracture, you want to be careful in setting it, which may be quite a procedure. And then you want to pacify it or to immobilize it with a cast or something like that. All right, now we have known about doing that for many, many centuries. In fact, going back to the gladiator time of Rome, they have discovered now that the gladiators, the owners of these slaves and the people who were making money off of the gladiatorial system, did not want their gladiators killed. Because of that, the weapons that were chosen were chosen so that they wouldn't actually kill. The modern movies that they have nowadays go for the kill because it's all staged anyway, right? All right, so an example of that is whenever— and you've seen quite often— a helicopter crash, a disaster. Right, many movies have them. No helicopters killed. So, um, in the gladiator days, they actually had quite a lot of medical science to keep these gladiators alive so that they could go back into battle again. They had good ones. I mean, these guys, if you've got a gladiator that's really good at it, you want to keep him alive and keep him gladiating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he might be a moneymaker.

**Speaker A:** He's a moneymaker for sure. And because of that, they wanted to keep him alive. And that meant that that kind of medicine, blunt force tragedy, traumas, hit with axes and things like this. Were very good, let us say, they had many opportunities for that kind of medicine even way back when, and they became fairly good at it. But that kind of medicine is quite rare in our society. We do not have a whole lot of coliseums all over. We do have automobile accidents and other things that are blunt force trauma. But surprisingly enough, most medicine is not around blunt trauma. Gunshot wounds, arrow wounds, knife wounds, stab wounds, heads banging into windshields, that kind of stuff is actually quite rare. An example of that is, how much of that have you had in your life?

**Speaker B:** Not too much.

**Speaker A:** Not too much. Well, that's the actual way of looking at it. It's not too much. Um, so let's start moving in the other, uh, further in the direction of, uh, and then, and in fact, we could go so far as to bring up the Dhamma in the idea of the blunt force that in fact, if you're wise enough to not be a gladiator, you're probably going to be wise enough to not get cut up so much. Okay. So when wisdom comes, we can begin to avoid even blunt force because we just simply stay away from it. If an arrow comes flying through the air at you and you can see it coming, because you're watching, then you can step out of its way, bat, knock it out of the way. If you're really good, you can catch it in the air before it strikes. Okay, but the point is, is that even in blunt force, we still have mental components to it. We can also say that there's other kinds of blunt force, but we could call it kind of semi-blunt force in the way of asbestos or COVID-19. But both of these do have psychological components also. In the days when we did not know about COVID-19, then there was all ignorance. Or if there was in the day when nobody knew about asbestos, my dad actually died from asbestos. But in the days when they didn't even know about it, because that was back in the 1940s and '50s when he was putting asbestos as liner to hot water heaters. Oh my. Okay. But now they know how dangerous it is, and so how careful it is. Look how knowledge now prevents cancer. If you know to stay away from the dangers of asbestos, you can do so. We also know that about COVID Now by wearing a mask and staying separate. All right, so there's this whole area of things that we have some control over if we have knowledge of it. Yep. Okay, so when we are looking at the point of disease, then some diseases that some people catch, we don't really— or they don't really know the background or why it happened or things like this because they simply weren't paying attention to it. They didn't see things correctly. It's very hard, in fact, to see the effect that asbestos dust has on roof in the 1930s when nobody knew that. As I mean, back in the '30s, asbestos was used for almost everything. Yeah, even in houses, they used it for sheetrock.

**Speaker B:** I think it's a great material except for the horrible toxicity, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, except for the fact that it gets very, very granular, very, very small into the lungs and sticks there, something like COVID does. Same thing with coal or with carbon. Carbon is enormously useful. But coal dust, which is actually nothing but karma, is not particularly good for you. But we know that now. And at one time that we didn't know what black lung disease was, we just knew about it and it began to figure it out. But you know, a lot of people died with it before they figured out what was going on. So this is basically what we're talking about is that As medical science grows, it's the knowledge, but it's not just the knowledge of the doctors, it's the knowledge of the entire population. Right. And so we're going in a healthier direction. But now there's always been the other part of it, the unknown. The known was there with blunt force right from the very beginning, or at least a long time ago. Now we're moving up further the chain into knowledge and wisdom, and we're beginning to look at effects that are quite strange, that almost look like magic in the sense of blunt force trauma now becomes bedside medicine, and that the medication needs to be tested with double-blind accuracy to see the actual effect of the medicine. Because of this other psychological thing that we're talking about, the placebo effect. Yeah. Now, one could say that, wait a minute, maybe we need to better understand and actually study the placebo effect, because the placebo effect is quite remarkable, that in general, anyone who is in a blind study of a new medication it's generally 28%. Now that's quite a remarkable point, that 28% mark.

**Speaker B:** Are you saying 28% of the people, or they all get 28% better? Like, what is that number exactly?

**Speaker A:** Well, generally 28% of the people, I would think, would voice, let us say, improvement. Because of a particular medication. That's a particularly interesting question that you ask, because different studies ask different kinds of questions. Yeah, but just in general, the general kinds of questions that they answered and whatnot, it winds up being at about 28% overall. But they can actually make some changes to that. In fact, if you have someone in a double-blind experiment, but this time the medication requires hospitalization and IVs and monitoring and nurses coming out, in and out, checking pieces of paper on a clipboard that's hung on the bed, that kind of placebo will go up to about 46%, nearly half the people. Will get, let us say, if we're using the word cured, we can say half the people can get cured simply by being put in hospital without the hospital ever doing anything. Why? Because such a profound placebo effect that the mind really gets into the point that all this— they're doing so much to help me that I've got to get that benefit from it. That's an interesting point about this placebo effect, that we, the humans, literally talk themselves into it or believe that this placebo pill is actually going to do its job that I was told that it should do. Okay, this is how strong the human mind is, except that it's also manipulable By the people who control the pills, is this a good pill or is this a placebo? Well, you can take it out of the world of medicine into the world of politics for just a little bit and see that one politician will be giving a pill and he will get a certain response, but another politician can give a placebo and still get 28% of the people to vote for him. Isn't that amazing?

**Speaker B:** And if he says the right things the right way, he might get a lot more than that.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. So that's the whole point of the belief system. So if you have something like acid reflux, or maybe burping, or maybe heartburn, or things like that that indicate you're there's too much acid in the system, then old tried and true mechanisms actually change the body chemistry. For instance, Pepto-Bismol is the base, and when you put that into the body, it combines with any extra acids that's in there and everything becomes neutralized. The The extra acid that we have in the body is because we've eaten something that had a lot of acid base to it. The example of that is, let us say, pungent things like onions and garlic and peppers and all kinds of stuff like that are more acidic. Milk is more a base.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we can actually start looking at the foods we eat to see if they actually have an effect upon our acid balance inside, because it's a very good idea for us to start watching.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And understand that what we— what we're drinking are taking has that kind of effect. So Pepto-Bismol and gosh, there's all kinds of antacids that have been antacids on the shelf for many centuries because the chemists way back when knew what pH factors were. It's an old, old system and we've known about chemical combinations of acids and bases and things like that for a long time. So those kinds of things that operate at that level have been on the market for so many years that people have great faith in them because they just actually work as well as sometimes they're even advertised. And because of that, then you have both the placebo effect and the actual chemical base of this medicine that's going to actually do something. But when people will go to the doctor and the doctor is going to recommend some modern pill, that also has a placebo effect to it. Oh, this is something new, without recognizing, wait a minute, an acid is not new. And so, we're moving into the quality that there all along has been two elements of medical science. And in the United States, it has quite a lot of mixture to it, because the pharmaceutical industry's influence on the doctors. So to get the doctors to give strange new medications from the pharmaceutical company for stuff that— I mean, just drinking a glass of milk or taking 3 or 4 teaspoons of an antacid would be all this that's needed to straighten the body out. Guess what? There's another point about acid, and that is, do you know what carbonic acid is?

**Speaker B:** Remind me, I'm out of date on my chemistry here.

**Speaker A:** You call— they call it carbon— excuse me, they call it acid rain sometimes. Carbonic acid is water and carbon dioxide mixed together in solution. Comes carbonic acid. The more carbon dioxide you put in it, the higher the pH level goes, up to a point of about almost what, 7 or so? I mean, one point, about almost up to 8. I think the middle point is at 7. So anyway, um, a whole lot of weak carbonic acid in the system is acidic. Surprisingly enough, the main product that the human body gives off just by living— and we're not talking about it at the skin level, we're talking about deep inside the muscles— every muscle movement requires chemical energy being exchanged, which means every twitch of your finger is going to create a few molecules of carbon dioxide that's going to get mixed in with the blood. But in fact, this is what we call tired. What tiredness is, you see two alligators wrestling, they're not going to wrestle all night and all day. They're going to wrestle for about 10 or 20 seconds. And if they can't do their business in that time, they get tired. What does that mean? That means that the carbon dioxide is built up in the system, which means now the body has gotten very acidic. Now we already know enough about Anapanasati to know that breathing will take this carbon dioxide out of the system. So that's one thing that we can look at from both knowledge and the placebo effect, is, oh, I can actually change my body chemistry through breathing, right? So that if I feel, or that the body has got a lot of acid to it, if I've got burping that tastes sour. You know all the symptoms, I think.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's interesting. Like, I don't get the heartburn that everyone complains about. Like, there's none of that. So it's very— it's mysterious to me.

**Speaker A:** Well, what is the— what are the symptoms?

**Speaker B:** Like, if I drink water, I'll start like having to burp afterwards. Uh, not really sure why.

**Speaker A:** What happens when you drink water?

**Speaker B:** I'll have to start like belching afterwards. Maybe the swallowing is a little strange, or yeah, I'm not sure why it is.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes, belching means that there's a lot of air, or something like air, something that was air. Is in the stomach. And there's many ways that air can get into the stomach. One is by intentionally swallowing air. Another one is by— while we're drinking water, we drink in air with it. Also, when we eat food, we— that's why burping and belching at the end of a big meal Many, many chefs want to hear their customers belch because that means that they ate— they liked their food so much that they ate it quickly and therefore took in a lot of air also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But there's also chemical reactions in the belly itself that can add gases, and so we can belch them out also. And generally the taste of it will determine whether this was swallowed air or whether it was burned out air. Why? Because the burned out air actually tastes very acidic. This is what we mean by that acid that comes up. So the drinking of the water may not be directly related, and in fact drinking the water, and even better, milk, and even better than that, Pepto-Bismol, But just drinking water will, let us say, disperse the acid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I drink a lot of water.

**Speaker A:** So drinking a lot of water will help. Got neighbors, a neighbor dog is coming. Local dog being very territorial about it. Sorry about that. So the point that we could go on into though is in the sense of how the medical system actually abuses. Now the thing of it is, in, in Thailand, the doctors here Almost, let us say, almost all the doctors that I have contact with are part of the system that basically the government will give a student who is ready for and passes, he can get his medical degree and all of the medical education for free.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** But he has to sign a 10-year contract saying that for 10 years he will work as a doctor in the public medical system. Okay. All right. Which means now that the doctors, uh, have lost their incentive for making vast sums of money until they're— they've spent 10 years. So, uh, by the time that a doctor is educated, he's in his 30s, maybe even getting close to 40 before he can actually go into private practice. But most of the Thai people want to go to the hospitals anyway because it's free. So for this reason, the doctors here are incentivized to just do the medicine. They don't make any profit off the drugs. They don't make anything more than the salary that they're paid by the hospitals.— to where in the West, it's a very capitalistic system. And it is quite possible for a man to get a medical degree, and then go off and do other things, because you can make even more money at it. For many years, the head of Occidental Petroleum was actually a medical doctor that didn't practice medicine at all, because he could make so much more money being the CEO of a big oil company. And this happens on a regular basis, but mostly in the West, we expect doctors to be really wealthy people, like the richest guy in town.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Right. We have to pay back some tremendous medical loans usually.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and also they complain about malpractice insurance and all of that kind of stuff because the country is very litigious, which means now that the medical doctors in the United States have a whole lot more complicated practice than in general the doctors in Thailand have. Okay, they have a much more complicated practice, and for that reason the pharmaceutical company has had a great deal of influence on the medical doctors. And in fact, you probably heard about the court cases that one family— I forgot the name of it— that were promoting the opioids that got so many people addicted to painkillers in the United States. Well, most pain that people have is the pain of a broken heart of a bad capitalistic system anyway. And so now you have all of these opioids that were kind of in one way given as a placebo, even though the side effects were enormous. The actual effects of these drugs were more psychological. Than actually beneficial. Okay. There's also the other side of the pharmaceutical industry, is that they would rather make a pill that cures the symptoms than they would to make a pill that cures the disease. Because if they make a pill that cures the disease, they sell a few pills to cure the disease and they're out of business. If they make pills that cure symptoms Then the sick people keep taking the pills year after year after year after year.

**Speaker B:** You got a lifelong customer.

**Speaker A:** And they've got a lifelong customer, precisely. So these are some of the disadvantages when you have a capitalistic medical system, and that it would be much better if we could bring it into a more socialized medical system the way that it is in so many other countries. But in the United States, you actually have to be aware that even though the man has a degree in medicine, he's probably about 75% charlatan and 25% medical doctor because of all of these influences. Where in Thailand, the new doctors, especially in the first 10 years of practice, are about 100% medical doctor because they've got no incentive to do otherwise. Where the doctors in the United States are incentivized to join the Rotary Club, and join the Lions Club, and join the Republican Party, and to get in bed with the pharmaceutical industry, and just sell the drugs to their clients, rather than actually finding out what the real problems are and working on that. So as you can tell, I'm not a big fan of medical science in the United States. However, if there was a reason to go to one, I would go. If there's a reason to go to— part of the reason why a lot of doctors are not 100% doctors in the United States is because about half the time the they see people, that people didn't need to go to the doctor in the first place. They didn't need to go to the doctor. My mom was a hypochondriac. I learned about hypochondriacism as a child. Okay. I learned to see a poor woman take her children to the doctor when there was no need to go other than the doctor said so. And so this is a great deal of what's happening, is that if you are wise, you will decide what you need from a doctor and go and get that. But otherwise, you probably don't need to go to the doctor because you can't trust them

**Speaker B:** anyway. And it's kind of sad to think

**Speaker A:** about it like that. Well, that's the wise way of thinking about it, is that medical science in the United States is part of capitalism, and because of that, it's polluted. It's not— medical science does not always have the client's best interest in mind. And in fact, it happened back in the 1980s. What's that? When the hospitals got out of the hospital market and got into the market of making money off of sick people. That's when the accountants basically took over. Before that, a hospital was a hospital, and they would treat people that were sick. Now they want to treat your wallet before they treat the patient. And so this is what's happened with medical science in, in the United States, is it's gotten almost completely commercialized. That would be another reason why I wouldn't want to live in the United States, because here in Thailand I trust the medical profession, but in the United States, I don't Trusting because of the fact that just one of the points about malpractice insurance and the fear of being sued in America means that the doctors will take extra special precautions. They'll have extra tests done. They'll make more procedures. They'll do things that cost extra money that you wouldn't really need to be done other than you're just making sure. And that making sure actually doubles the

**Speaker B:** price. In this case, I almost wish there was more testing and less like, here, have this medicine. We don't know if you even need it, but have it anyway.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, how do you feel right now?

**Speaker B:** Right now I feel fine. I haven't started it yet, so—

**Speaker A:** Hey! All right, so the placebo actually worked to the point that you went to see the doctor, the doctor gave you the medicine, and you felt better without even having to take the medicine.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think going to the doctor made me feel worse because I knew I'm going to have to take the medicine that I— you know, maybe it's just me being overly worried, but I kind of doubt that we fully understand the effects of these fancy new medicines. So that's where my apprehension is coming from.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, I've got a story for you. This is actually a Goenka story. Perfect. The Goenka story is that an old woman was sick in her village. She needed to go to the doctor. She didn't have the money to go to the doctor in the village in India because there were no doctors around. So her family or friends, people got together and got enough money so that she could go to the doctor. A famous doctor. She went to this famous Arya Vedic doctor, and it happened to have been that his offices were on the second and third floor of this shop house, and on the first floor was a pharmacy. But she goes up the steps and she goes to the doctor, and he talks to her and gives her a diagnosis and writes a chit and says, take this downstairs to the pharmacy and he'll prescribe the medicine for you. He'll give you the medicine. And so she went down and he gave her the medicine. And while they were— while she was there, she noticed that they had all kinds of stuff in the shop. Candles, incense, photos of the Ayurvedic doctor, all kinds of things. And so she buys a bunch of this stuff too with a little bit of money that she left. She goes home and she puts an altar up high She puts the picture of the doctor, the candle, the incense, and the medicine up there on the altar. And every day she comes in and prays, 'Oh, thank you, Doctor, for curing me. I am so happy that I have seen you.' She didn't take the medicine. It's on the shelf. Yeah. And I thought I'd remind you that reminded me, because that's what's happened to you, that you didn't even bother to take the medicine. And you feel better. Or maybe that it had to do with the— that the acid was temporary, that you did drink enough water, your body did stabilize, and you didn't need to take that medicine that the doctor prescribed for

**Speaker B:** you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So these are all things to start watching, start keeping track of. This is part of wisdom, is to look at the sequence of events that are happening and notice how you feel. That's one of the things that I have been curious about for many, many years, that I'd go to a doctor and he'd give more than one pill. Can't give just one, they got to give several, right? And so here I'm on the internet asking, what does what pill do? That's not enough. I want to actually take the pill to see what effect it has. And if I can't experience the effect, then What's the purpose of the pill? Now I'm being a little bit more sophisticated because I know, for instance, that blood pressure is hard to tell whether that is. But if you got a sphygmometer at home for about $10, then you can check these pills to see what effect they do have on blood pressure, right? What effects that they do have. This is an important thing is for us to really begin to get to know the body Um, that it's one of the phrases out of the Hippocratic Oath system is physician heal thyself, along with physician know thyself. But they're not talking about medical doctors only, they're talking about you become your own physician. Okay, you watch that body. You start noticing what it's doing. It's going to get old. It's going to have some aches and pains. That's something that's kind of interesting too, so long as we're talking about like this. And that is, is that most people think that troubles in life come and go and come and go. But the reality is, is that things Actually, overall, they come and they peak and then they go downhill. But the downhill journey is a lot longer than the uphill journey in time, in the sense of being over the hill, in the sense of there you— one thing, I mean, it doesn't matter much matter what you do have to look forward to. There's a lot of stuff to look forward to, but one thing for sure are without a doubt old age, sickness, and death.

**Speaker B:** If I'm lucky, right?

**Speaker A:** If you're lucky. If you're lucky, old age, sickness, and death. If you're not lucky, you'll get sick before you get old. If you're not lucky at all, you'll get sick and die before you get old. So if you're lucky you get old, you get sick, and you die. And you can also use that word luck in the sense of also choices, the choice in the sense of looking at what's going on. See those arrows, know what asbestos is, etc., like that. Okay, so when we have that kind of knowledge, we can avoid it and go into old age. But guess what? Still going to get old. That they, they have not— they don't have a clue about. There's a whole lot of dreaming going on, a whole lot of cryogenic research and whatnot like that. But that's all really into that mystical area of wanting things that we can't have. Yeah. And that's a lot of what medical science actually tries to do, is it tries to appease people or fib to them or lie to them or give them a placebo or whatever. In fact, they would hope that whatever lie they tell them becomes a placebo so that it does give them the good effect. But the fact is, is that there's a lot of charlatanism that goes on on that side too, and that part of that charlatanism is the lies that each individual one of us tell ourselves about our health. That was charlatanism. Starts at home. And you're in really hot water if the charlatan, the hypochondriac, goes to a doctor who's going to know that this is a hypochondriac and just going to take their money and do no good for them. But at least they get the placebo effect. Well, I went to the doctor and he said everything was okay. But we can tell ourselves that. We can become our own physician. We can recognize and see things for ourselves, knowing that we need to get really good at being a physician, because we're going to have an old sick man to take care of someday. Yeah, hopefully. Hopefully, if you're lucky. And so in that regard, we need to get ready for that. We need to get prepared in youth so that we know that when we get old, we've got the mentality that we can handle getting old. If we begin to recognize, well, I didn't need to do that anyway, there comes a time when I no longer need to pole vault.

**Speaker B:** I think I may have already come to that

**Speaker A:** time. Well, when I was about 10 years old, I really needed to pole vault. I just couldn't do it. So that's the whole idea then, is that part of it is giving up all the desires that we've had all of our lives that we've never done, never will do, and start recognizing that what we do have right now is good enough. So when heartburn or when acid reflux comes up, the right thing to do is start reflecting, what have I had today? What did I eat that causes this? What can I do to play with it right now? Can I drink some water? Can I drink some milk? Do I know enough about chemistry that I can make some chemical changes in there? And if I— and also, can I take some deep breathing? But in that regard, We're talking about let's do this right here, right now. Let's take charge. We're the position. We're the lion. We're the one who is in charge of this life. Let's do our duties right now. But the Western mind has been trained to be that hypochondriac. Oh, I need somebody else to help me. Oh, I've got a boo-boo. Mommy, please kiss it and make it better. Right, this is the mentality that we grow up with. And so we go to the doctor and ask him to kiss our boo-boo to make it better. And that's the placebo effect. Going to the doctor often has more psychological advantage for people than we realize. And we don't really need to go to the doctor out there and pay him $150 or $300 or whatever We can sit there and knock on the door of the chief physician in the house and say, hey man, I need some placebo right

**Speaker B:** now.

**Speaker A:** That we could talk ourselves into feeling good. We can actually take control over the body. This is the the way of looking at it, that we need to have adequate medicine, but just adequate medicine. And the United States in general is overly medicated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that's where my big fear comes from, is I'm trying to avoid all of that at a young age

**Speaker A:** especially. Mm-hmm. Yes. And well, the way to avoid it is by being knowledgeable. By being awake, by noticing how you feel, by paying attention to this body before it actually does get old, to take care of it, uh, and to give it, uh, the nourishment that it needs. Uh, and I'm not talking about just physical food of nourishment, but also, uh, the Buddha talks about it in the sense of contact and consciousness and intention. But basically, we can look at that in the sense of the practice of Anapanasati, consciousness in the sense of paying attention to what's going on, notice what's going on, be in contact with the body. In our modern language, we'd say we've got to have skin in the game. Literally, you've got skin in this game. The funny part about it is, is that we keep wanting to give all of our skin to the doctor to get him to fix it. Yeah, instead of recognizing the doctor has got his own problems, and he is not probably has got as much, uh, good intention for your skin as, uh, as you do. And so everyone has a responsibility to a degree to become their own physician. And we have information available to us now that the medical information 50 years ago was much more difficult to come by. If you bought a book like Gray's Anatomy, it cost you $50 back then. Now it's probably $250 if you buy it now, but you can probably find a PDF of it someplace on the internet anyway. Probably. So this is the whole idea of medicine, is that medical knowledge is becoming more advanced in the sense of the medical sciences figuring out more and more. But a more important point is, is that all of the medical science that has been known for the past 2,000 years is now becoming more and more available to everyone. So that any pill that you ever get prescribed by a doctor, first thing you do before you take it is to look it up on the internet, Google it, find out who's doing what with it and things like this so that you know what's going on. And then when you take the pill, you want to monitor the body to see what effects, to see if that pill is doing its job. This may take some special, uh, kind of extra special noticing, but really just sitting down with nothing else to do, uh, and I would recommend it about 20 minutes after any pill. This is because, uh, 20 minutes was something that a really good friend, uh, also a Dhamma dude who was trained nurse, he said that that's how long it takes for a pill to get into the system get dispersed out of the— and into the bloodstream. So after about 20 minutes of any pill that you take, that's when you want to start— just, you know, you can call it meditation. Sit on the floor, squat on the floor, take a deep breath, and start watching the body and noticing what effect that pill had on the body, if any. Okay. Okay, note carefully, note wisely, this is a really good experiment to work with because it really helps to teach the effects and the uses of medications and keeps the body fit. Because basically you could say that there's no— even if the medicine is defective, the placebo effect is still

**Speaker B:** involved. I just have to make sure I don't give myself a negative— maybe there's a word for it, like a negative placebo effect, when you're like worried about something and then you kind of create it in your own mind.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that interesting? You brought up a major point that if you give yourself pills of unwholesome thoughts, the placebo effect alone is likely that about a third of the time you're going to feel bad just by having negative thoughts, and sometimes it's guaranteed. Yeah. And so this is another reason, uh, to, uh, recognize that, yes, that placebo effect, or the way— and then you could go so far as to call the placebo effect part of the attitude. And so by changing our attitude, we actually change that placebo effect in the sense that we can actually get it higher and higher. We know that this is going to work. This is part of the, uh, the path of becoming enthusiastic and energetic through the path of the Dharma, to keep looking, keep watching, keep, uh, evaluating, because you recognize that there's really nothing worth else doing in life other than paying attention to what's going on, paying attention to what's going on inside the body, paying attention to what's going on in the mind, paying attention to the, um, environment that we're in. This is being here now is what literally we're talking about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, got to look out for falling trees, as it were.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, but the house unfortunately can't do that and can't move out of the way, but you can. Yeah, so I'm glad that you didn't get hurt by the falling tree.

**Speaker B:** Me

**Speaker A:** too. So I think that we pretty well finished with that issue about medical science and placebos and becoming your own physician. And the last word to say is that I would never recommend anyone go against what they think they need to do by going to a doctor. I would never recommend somebody, oh, don't go to the doctor because of blah blah. That if you want to go to the doctor, that's the thing to do. I would never want to interfere. If some— if a doctor is giving somebody medication and they ask me about it, I would say what I've said to you in the sense of become your own physician. But now do your own monitoring, figure out for sure what effects that medication has upon you. Yeah. And I have seen then people that have an example of it. Commonly is lithium-based drugs for the diagnosis of bipolar or manic depressive personality disorder, those kind of labels. They get a lithium-based drug. And people who begin to monitor that drug begin to figure out for themselves that we need to take it sometimes, but not on a regular position basis the way that it's prescribed, that it actually has some value for it, but only in particular moments or only on particular days. And others who say that they can throw that out, they don't need it at all. So the reason that the doctors do the timing like once, twice, three, four times a day for a medicine is based upon the recommendations from the research that was done on that medicine for large numbers of people. Okay, but each individual person needs to be their own physician and needs to be their own medical research team to find out for sure what effects and when they need it and that kind of stuff, and start paying attention to it rather than just taking it because it prescribed at a particular part of time of day. Okay, again, we're talking about really putting some skin in the game.

**Speaker B:** Lots of investigation.

**Speaker A:** Lots of investigation to become aware of what the body is doing. This is something that I would recommend that you do in conjunction with going to the doctor. So do you have any more questions about this? I think that we pretty well covered it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so. Uh, we're just gonna see what happens and investigate it. I'll explain it from there.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we'll go ahead and finish now then. And I'm glad to see you again, Brian. Yeah, you and your room be very well.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye. We'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Brian (Speaker B), explores the relationship between modern medicine, the placebo effect, and Buddhist wisdom. The discussion was sparked by Brian's recent visit to a doctor and his apprehension about taking prescribed medication.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Theme: Become Your Own Physician**
The central advice is not to reject modern medicine, but to become an active, investigative participant in your own health. One should never be discouraged from seeing a doctor, but should complement that with personal observation and wisdom.

**Main Arguments and Observations:**

1.  **Two Strands of Medicine:** Medicine has always had a dual nature: a practical, scientifically-tested side (originating in effective shamanism) and a "mystical" or psychological side (the placebo effect).

2.  **The Power of the Placebo Effect:** The talk highlights the remarkable strength of the mind, citing that in drug trials, about 28% of people report improvement from a placebo. This effect can soar to nearly 50% with more elaborate medical theater (like hospitalization). This demonstrates that belief and expectation are powerful healing forces.

3.  **Critique of Capitalistic Medical Systems:** Dhammarato contrasts the Thai medical system (where doctors are salaried public servants for a decade) with the U.S. system. He argues that the profit motive in the U.S. leads to over-medication, the promotion of lifelong symptom-managers over cures, and a situation where doctors can be influenced by pharmaceutical companies. He suggests this makes American doctors sometimes act more like "charlatans" than pure healers.

4.  **Wisdom as Preventative Medicine:** Just as knowledge about asbestos or COVID-19 allows us to avoid physical harm, wisdom in life helps us avoid "blunt force trauma"—both physical and mental—by making skillful choices and paying attention to causes and conditions.

5.  **Practical Self-Care & Investigation:**
    *   **Monitor Effects:** Before taking any medication, research it. Then, after taking it (especially ~20 minutes later, when it enters the bloodstream), sit mindfully and investigate its physical and mental effects.
    *   **Simple Remedies First:** For common issues like acid reflux, consider dietary changes, water, milk, or established antacids before automatically opting for new, heavily marketed pharmaceuticals.
    *   **Breathing as Medicine:** The practice of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) is highlighted as a way to regulate the body, such as reducing acidity by expelling carbon dioxide.

6.  **A Buddhist Parable:** Dhammarato shares a story from the Goenka tradition where a woman is cured not by the medicine she was given, but by her faith in the doctor and the ritual she created around the bottle—illustrating the placebo effect and the power of the mind.

7.  **The Ultimate Context: Old Age, Sickness, and Death:** The talk grounds the discussion in the core Buddhist reflections. We are advised to prepare for aging by learning to care for ourselves now, letting go of unskillful desires, and developing the mental resilience to handle the body's inevitable decline.

**Conclusion:** The talk encourages a middle path: use doctors and medicine skillfully when needed, but cultivate the ultimate responsibility for your own well-being. This involves mindful investigation of treatments, understanding the power of your own mind (both for good and ill), and developing the wisdom to navigate a healthcare system that may not always have your best interest at heart. The final takeaway is to "put some skin in the game" and be the primary investigator and caregiver for your own body and mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about medicine, the mind-body connection, and the healthcare system. Here’s a breakdown:

### **1. The Gladiator Metaphor (Historical Analogy)**
*   **What it is:** Speaker A uses gladiators in ancient Rome as a metaphor for the origins of practical, trauma-based medicine.
*   **Purpose:** To argue that effective, "scientifically based" medicine grew out of practical necessity (keeping valuable gladiators alive) and observation, which he links to early shamanism. It illustrates that a core of medicine is about solving obvious, physical problems (like setting a broken bone), a knowledge base built over centuries.

### **2. The Arrow Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The image of an arrow flying at you, which you can see and avoid if you are watchful and wise.
*   **Purpose:** To extend the idea of medicine beyond blunt force trauma into the realm of **prevention through knowledge and awareness**. Just as you can step aside from a physical arrow, you can avoid "arrows" like asbestos or COVID-19 by understanding the danger and taking precautions (e.g., wearing a mask). This bridges physical health and mental wisdom.

### **3. The Placebo Effect as a Political Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Speaker A directly compares the placebo effect in medicine to politics.
*   **Purpose:** To highlight the power of belief and persuasion. He states that just as a placebo pill can get a 28% positive response, a politician giving a "placebo" (empty promises) can still get 28% of the vote. This metaphor underscores his point that the **human mind is powerfully influenced by expectation and presentation**, whether in a clinic or the public sphere.

### **4. The "Become Your Own Physician" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** This is a central, recurring metaphor framed as a directive or role.
*   **Purpose:** To advocate for personal agency and mindful investigation over passive reliance on doctors. It means taking active responsibility for monitoring your body, researching medications, and observing the effects of treatments. It's presented as the antidote to being a passive recipient in a commercialized medical system.

### **5. The "Skin in the Game" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A common idiom used to mean having a personal stake or investment in an outcome.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that the individual has the most to lose or gain with their own health. The speaker contrasts this with "wanting to give all of our skin to the doctor," arguing that you, not an external authority, have the primary responsibility and should be the most invested investigator of your own well-being.

### **6. The Goenka Story (Anecdote)**
*   **What it is:** A story attributed to S.N. Goenka about an old Indian woman who is prescribed medicine by an Ayurvedic doctor.
*   **Purpose:** To humorously and powerfully illustrate the **pure placebo effect and the power of faith**. The woman doesn't take the medicine; instead, she creates an altar with the doctor's picture and the medicine, prays to it daily, and gets better. Speaker A uses this to mirror Brian's own situation (feeling better without taking the prescribed pills) and to suggest that the act of seeking help and believing in a solution can itself be curative.

### **7. The "Over the Hill" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A description of life's trajectory as going uphill, peaking, and then having a longer downhill journey.
*   **Purpose:** To ground the discussion in the unavoidable realities of **aging, sickness, and death** (*jarā, vyādhi, maraṇa* in Buddhist terms). This metaphor sets the stage for why it's crucial to cultivate wisdom and self-awareness early—to navigate the long "downhill" journey with understanding and to avoid unnecessary suffering caused by ignorance or charlatanism.

### **8. The Hypochondriac & the "Boo-Boo" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Speaker A uses the figure of the hypochondriac and the childish need for a parent to "kiss a boo-boo" to make it better.
*   **Purpose:** To critique what he sees as a **culturally conditioned, passive approach to health** in the West. He argues that the tendency to run to a doctor for every minor issue is an adult version of this childlike dynamic, where the visit itself (the "kiss") provides a psychological placebo rather than addressing a real physical need.

### **Summary of Core Themes These Metaphors Support:**
*   Medicine has both a practical/scientific history and a "mystical" (placebo/ belief-based) component.
*   Wisdom and awareness are crucial forms of preventive medicine.
*   The modern Western healthcare system is distorted by capitalism, creating misaligned incentives.
*   The individual must be an active, investigative agent in their health journey, not a passive patient.
*   The mind has a profound, measurable effect on the body (placebo effect), which can be harnessed or manipulated.
