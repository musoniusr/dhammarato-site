### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome to the Saturday morning call. This is actually designed for the United States on Friday evening, but about half the people on the, uh, the call right now are actually on this island. So, um, welcome everybody. Um, Al has asked a question about non-dualism and dualism. And the first thing that I want to say, and actually to emphasize it, is anyone who is talking about non-dual is coming from duality. That when we speak of it, we always in fact when we're talking about the Dharma, we're talking from unity. We're talking about how to get the mind unified. We're talking about how to come out of duality, but we don't use that kind of language. And that when people are talking about duality and non-duality, generally when they are talking about it, they have to be in the state of duality in order to talk about duality versus unity. But when you are in unity, that's just what we're talking about. So that's the first thing to say. Um, now let's talk about then how to get the mind unified, or what does unification actually mean. And that most of the Westerners are raised in a duality kind of mentality. —for instance, mother and child, children and adults, workers and bosses, government officials and prisoners, all kinds of dualities that we find in this culture. And that these are actually personality kinds of things. And so, uh, inside and outside is another way of looking at duality, and that most of the time we spend, uh, thinking about what's on the outside and don't spend much time looking at and investigating what's going on on the inside.. And in that regard, we confuse what is reality and what is stuff we make up. So that's a new, a different way of looking at duality— is what's real is unity, and what stuff we make up is then not real and therefore creates a duality. So, um, almost all of Western culture is made up. Religions are made up. Countries and borders and boundaries are made up. Languages are made up. Stories are made up. The most important one to recognize is that religions are made up. They're not real. And often there's stories about something that happened so long ago that it's not real at all. It's just ancient history. And by the way, history is not really what happened. What's in the history books never reflects what's actually, actually happened in the past. And so all of that duality is there. And so the way to start to work with this is by following the teachings of the Buddha. You can— another way that you can think of it then is, is that whenever we are in duality, we are probably in a state of dissatisfaction, and that when we're in a state of unity, that means we're in a state of satisfaction. That when we get real, real is okay. It's when we want real to match up with our ideal, our design, our philosophy, our rules, the way things are supposed to be, the way things should be. And that's what creates the duality of it should be this way. You're supposed to go to school.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** The reality is the kid's playing hooky, but calling it hooky is from that duality. So let's recognize then that the real point is what the Buddha said was, I only teach one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's the only thing that he teaches. And that by teaching Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, that gives us the Four Noble Truths. And the Four Noble Truths basically is that dissatisfaction exists, which means duality does exist. The difference between how things really are and the way we want them to be. That in fact, we can look at it as a— it's not just a duality, it's actually a trinity. And what is the Trinity? One is reality, the other one is how it is supposed to be according to some standards, according to some rules, laws, rituals, ceremonies, etc. And then the third one is what we actually want it to be, our desires. So there's not just a duality, there's a Trinity. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spook. What is the Father? That's how things are supposed to be. That's the laws, the rules, the Ten Commandments, the Five Precepts, the, um, uh, the Sharia law. All of that is the Father, or the parent, or, uh, the bosses. Who lay down the laws or the rules for everybody else. And then the son would be like— in each one of us there is a child. We started out as a child, and almost all of us, if we're lucky, remain a child rather than, let us say, a child who thinks he's an adult, which is what most people do. Uptight. And so that's a delusion. If we stay a child, then we're just a child. That's unity. But if we're a child who thinks that we're an adult because we're over 20 years old, then that's a duality. So you see, this unity and duality stuff is all over the place. So we can really then look at it in the sense of what's real and what's not real. And to finish the story, we are all a child. We're the son of the guy who makes all the rules. But then we have the holy spook, the air, the atmosphere that we live in, which is actually what's real. For instance, there is a sky. I don't think anybody, even an astrologer or an astronomer, would claim that there's not a sky. But what there's not, what is a part of the duality, is that there is a sky daddy who's got binoculars that are so powerful he can see right into your bedroom. And that's part of the duality, is all of these rules that we have. So where do we go from here? Well, if we can understand then that all dualities create dissatisfactions, then we can get to the point of what the Buddha is actually teaching. And what is he teaching is, is that if we can see this duality, if we can see our own dissatisfactions, if we can see our unwholesome thoughts, by being able to see it, we have the opportunity to change it. If you can't see it, if you can't change it, you can't eat it for dinner. If you can't catch it, you can't eat it. But if you can catch it, you can change it. This is the whole point, is that now we can say that there's yet another duality in the sense of that which you can see, touch, taste, feel, see, experience, and that which you made up. So there is the real, and we absorb the real through our senses. Now, let's look at a moment and recognize about thought, is that when our thoughts are about what's real, which is in reality, then we're unlikely to be dissatisfied and suffering. But when our thoughts are far from reality, that would be Dukkha, because the further away from reality we get, the more likely we are going to be dissatisfied with that reality that's so far away. Because we've got our wants and our desires, and we've got our rules and how things are supposed to be. So that's Dukkha— not real. Now let's look at the Second Noble Truth for a moment, and that is what is the cause of all of this, this, uh, this, uh, dissatisfaction. And the answer to that is in fact the most important point, because if you can understand this, then you will actually not have so much trouble. And that is that everybody, each one of us, creates our own delusions, we create our own dissatisfactions, we create our own desires, our own wants, we create our own rules, etc. That in fact we create our own dissatisfaction. Now, if that's true about each one of us here on this call, that means that everybody out there is in the same boat. They create their dissatisfaction, which means then that you can't fix them. You can't do it. Only individual can.

**Speaker C:** Change.

**Speaker A:** The lucky part is that if they hear the Dhamma, understand the Dhamma, and start to practice the Dhamma, then they will be able to see what's real and see what's delusional, see what's duality. Funny, that word delusion and duality, aren't they very close together, whether they're spelled? So if we can see that stuff then we have an opportunity to change, we have an opportunity to get real, we have an opportunity in fact to come out of our dissatisfaction into a state of satisfaction. This is what the point of the Second Noble Truth is, that everybody creates their own dissatisfaction. You can't blame the devil, you can't blame God, You can't blame the tsunami. You can't blame an act of God for destroying your house. You've only got your own self to blame. And in fact, self-blaming is another duality. And then in fact, the blame game is duality. Oh, it's not me, it's me. Oh, it's not me, it's me. Or oh, it's not me, it's me. This is the way that we have this duality going on. Or if it's not me, it's her. She did it. So this is the way that we create the duality, is by placing blame, which means that we are suffering or we are in dissatisfaction, but we didn't cause it, somebody else did. And the reality from the Second Noble Truth is, no, she didn't cause my suffering, I did. She didn't cause my dissatisfactions, I did. So at the heart of all of this Second Noble Truth is that word delusion. We are deluded from reality when we think that all of our troubles come from someplace else. Oh, I'm unhappy and poor because I didn't get a good education. Or, oh, I'd be so much better off without the IRS. Oh, I would be so happy if I didn't have a flat tire. In other words, look at all the different things that we can blame for our lack of happiness rather than recognizing that we are creating that unhappiness. It doesn't come from the outside, we're creating it on the inside. So that's enough for the Second Noble Truth. And the key to it is, is that you can't fix anybody but yourself, and nobody can fix you but you. And the way to fix yourself is by stop having these dualities inside and start having a unification, a unification of your own mind. So you get into the Third Noble Truth. The Third Noble Truth is the understanding that being unified is possible. That you can come out of your dissatisfactions into a state of satisfaction, and in fact you can do that immediately. But another kind of duality is that, oh, enlightenment is way off someplace, oh, I've got such a far journey to take. No, enlightenment is just a change of attitude from I'm not enlightened to 'I am enlightened.' Just make that one little change from your duality into reality. And so the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is exactly that. It happens immediately. And yet the way that most people see Buddhism is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha. Let me look at this Dukkha. Let me inspect this Dukkha. Let me take it apart and check the inside of it. Let me check— oh, this Dukkha is related to that Dukkha. Oh, and that dukkha is like a chain of beads. Let's go chase that dukkha right down the dukkha hole. And some people will spend 50 years in meditation still discovering yet more dukkha, when all we really have to do is to make that change. Oh, dukkha, out of here! I'm going to be happy instead. I'm going to be satisfied instead. That's all there really is to the teaching of the Buddha. It's your choice. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was really big on that point, that your Kamma is not like the Kamma machine, like actions and results of actions and all of that. Basically, what is your Kamma, what you have to put up with, is your past, because you keep repeating it over and over again. It's just a matter of choice, and your choice is yours. Are you going to go with your Kamma are you going to go without it? And when you're without the Kamma, when you're without the Kamma-Vipaka or the Kamma-Phala, which is the results of your actions, then you're in Unity. When you have Kamma and Kamma-Vipaka, or Kamma and Kamma-Phala— and by the way, the word Vipaka and Phala here have to do with the result or the fruit. Kamma vipaka means your actions and the fruit of the actions, and Kamma phala is actions and the fruit of actions, a duality. The reality is, is that you can have actions that have no result. You're not looking for results, you're just having a time. All right, here's an example of that, is the difference or the distinction between the word work and the word play. When we're working, we expect results. When we're playing, we don't expect any results. We're having too much fun right here in the moment to expect results. And if we do get some results, let's just go play with that too. Let's not make it into work. Let's just have a ball. Let's play with it. That's the reality, is that there really is no result. I mean, look at civilization. For thousands and thousands of years, people have been trying to improve civilization. Do you think that they've got it right yet, or do you want to make it another change, yet another change? Maybe change it from a president to a king, or maybe making some other changes. Whatever it is, it's not good enough yet. And yet we have been working on trying to make civilization good enough, and it never has been good enough. Guess what? That's not your job. Your job is to not make civilization better. Your job is to make your own mind better. Let civilization remain in duality—that's their choice, or that's the choice that's made universally. Let's get our mind together. So this is the third noble truth, is that you can come into the state of satisfaction immediately, and then you'll go back into dissatisfaction. You go back into the duality, and then if you practice correctly and see what's going on, you can come right back into a state of unity, a state of satisfaction. In and out and in and out and in and out. But as we keep coming back into it, we develop skills at being able to come back into it easier and easier and begin to stay in it more and more. But we will still go back into duality. The problem with it is, is that when people go into the duality, they don't like it. Instead of saying, hot dog, I've got an opportunity to go right back into unity again. In other words, when they see that they're in duality, they want to remain there. They want to fuss at themselves. Oh, my mind has wandered away, or oh, I'm not practicing correctly, or oh, I haven't practiced for so long, oh poor me. Rather than hot dog, I see that opportunity to come right back into Unity, right back into a state of joy and happiness. So this Third Noble Truth is an important point, that it can happen immediately as soon as you make the choice to come back into it, into a state of unification. Throw out all the rules, throw out all of the shoulds, woulds, coulds, and oughtas and idealisms. And also throw out all that we want and just be satisfied with the reality that is. Because guess what? You ain't strong enough to fix reality. Sorry dudes, reality is real and you don't have much choice other than to hate it or to be in it. And when you hate it, you're creating your own duality. But when you're in it, you're back into unity. So the Buddha actually now created a method for us to come back into unification of mind. This is called the Eightfold Noble Path. But the word path is a duality. I use the word method that you can apply a method and get immediate results, or you can be on a path forever. And that path then is duality because it's taking you someplace that you're not yet. So let us imagine it like a door. The door to unity is right in front of you, and all you have to do is to put the key in, turn the lock, and open the door, and there you are. But most people see that door as far, far away. It's up into heaven, or maybe it's in hell, or maybe it's a thousand miles from here, or maybe I gotta die to get to that door. All this duality, you see, is putting the door far, far away, where in fact that door is right here. This is why it's not a good idea to call it the Eightfold Noble path. That's a language mistake. Better thing to say is the Eightfold Noble Method, and we don't even need to have 8 anyway. So let us just call it the Noble Method. So let's start investigating this Noble Method for a moment, and that is that there is another kind of duality. Past and future are dualities. In fact, again, there's a trinity. There is the past, there is the future, and then there is right now. And right now is where the unity is found, not in the past. The past is dead. The future is yet to be. In fact, it may not be at all. It may be some different future. But what's real is always right now. And so there is this word called Sati, which has to do with remembering to be in the here now. A lot of our thoughts are thoughts about what we need to do, a lot of our thoughts about what happened. Then in fact, what happened and what needs to be done is that past-future duality that we're often in, rather than seeing how things are right now. For instance, danger. We were in danger in the past, and we will be in danger in the future, so they say. But the reality right now is, is that everything is okay. The danger is not here right now. So if we're actually in the here now, that means that we're in reality safe. So if we can in fact come to this present moment We're coming to unity. We're coming to reality. So the next thing is, well, what do we do once we get to reality? The answer to that is, let's take a look at it. Let's see what's real. Let's investigate both inside and outside. Let's see that in fact here we are in a state of unity. That you are not different from your environment. The Pali word for this, by the way, is idyapapajjata, and it means then that the reality is, is that you are the reality. You're in it, you're part of the mix. So this is how we would look at it on the outside, and that we can tell what is real through our senses— touch, taste. And then in fact, touch is probably the most important one, not vision. And yet most Westerners are in highly visual context. Dogs, however, are in highly olfactory. They don't want to look at it, they don't want to listen to it, they want to smell it. Have you ever given a piece of food to a dog? What does the dog do? He doesn't look at it and say, oh, that's a steak with broccoli and juice and all of that kind of stuff. He wants to know what that thing smells like. That's how they live their lives, is with, uh, with, um the sense of smell. And yet humans are very much oriented towards the sense of sight. So you can see that, John. I'll talk just a little bit about sexuality, that dogs do that with scent. They want to smell that butt. They want to smell what's going on. But humans, they want to see that bikini even if it's a mile away. They're very optically oriented. But the reality is, is that we are in our environment through our touch, through our senses in this regard, that when we're uncomfortable, it's the touch that's uncomfortable. The chair hurts, or the bug is biting, or that we're scratching or itching or whatever like that. And all sensuality and sexuality have to do with touch. In other words, people who drive by the brothel don't get a whole lot of satisfaction out of driving by the brothel. They want to go in and touch things. So when we recognize that the reality is, is that we're in that reality, and the way that we experience that reality is both with touch as well as taste and feel and smell and sight. But the most important one really is the touch. Now there's a sixth sense, and what is that sixth sense? Is the mind itself. The mind creates a whole lot of stuff. Now I'm not going to go into a great deal of detail, mostly concerning the issue of perception, but I will say that When we see something on the outside, we don't actually respond to what we see. We want to make a story about it. We want to put it in with the context that we've got. We want to make, let us say, it believable or be understanding. And I'll give the example of this: out there I see a tree. Now, everybody here, I assume, made an image of a tree in their mind. Why? Because you know what a tree looks like. Well, guess what? The tree that I'm looking at is not the tree that you invented in your mind. You invented the trees that you know of. The tree that I'm talking about is a fan palm. How many of you thought of a fan palm? How many of you had the image of that? Or did you see a pine tree or a deciduous tree, one with green leaves, etc., like that? So that's what we mean by— is that when we want to understand something, we make up a story about it, we make up an image, and that image is almost always different from reality, that we actually create a duality in the mind. So how do we come out of that? Well, we started with the Eightfold Noble Path in the sense of investigating. So now, instead of investigating the world that we are part of, now we're going to start also investigating what we are thinking, what we are feeling, what we are— attitudes and all of that kind of stuff. This is called the Satipatthana, or the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And that we can begin now with Sati to remember to be here now and to look at what's going on. And then we have a choice about what are we going to do. Are we going to stay in our duality, or are we going to come into unity? And we have that choice immediately available. We can see that this thought is an unwholesome thought, and we can immediately change it to a wholesome thought. Like, oh, I hate the IRS, they're just so meddlesome. And guess what? The IRS is not here right now. Wow, isn't that marvelous? Another one would be, oh, I hate police. Oh, the police are likely to come break into your house. The police are likely to stop you on the road and frisk you down and maybe stand on your neck. But the reality is There's no police here. Isn't that marvelous? Everything is okay. This is the way that we want to start listening to what's really going on, to start seeing what's really going on. The reality is, is that we don't have to deal with the stuff that we think up and dream up in our minds. We can in fact make a change from that duality all police are bad into the reality there's no peace here. And if the police is here, guess what? We create the duality by seeing that he is in a uniform, that he's a cop, that cops are bad, and we create that reality and we become afraid of the cop. But if we can see him as just a poor fool who's in a suit and that's all, We can be a friend of his. He doesn't— you don't have to see him as a cop. You can just see him as a guy. He's just a human being. The reality is, is that he probably doesn't even like being a cop, or that he likes being a cop because he likes being a bully and he likes to bully people. But the reality is, is that He would rather not bully people. So let's treat cops in a nice way. If you befriend him, he will befriend you. If you're afraid of him, he's going to pull his gun out. You think you've done something wrong if you're afraid of him, right? So you're again, you're creating your own reality. So the way to handle this is to begin to see things In fact, the Buddha recommends, let's get in seclusion, let's not deal with reality when we've got to really deal with reality. Let's go into seclusion, let's get away from the world, let's get away from it all, only to recognize by close investigation that we brought the world with us. And so now we have a different kind of seclusion to deal with. Seclusion physically, to get away from it all, and then start getting secluded away from all of our beliefs and all of our thoughts and all of our memories and all of our past and all of the futures, and come to this very moment. Everything is okay, everything is fine. Let's start living in that unity of everything is okay, everything is fine. Now if we start doing that, we develop the skill of, oh, I don't have to feel bad, I can feel good. Oh, I don't have to have an attitude of a victim, I can have the attitude of a winner. If we keep practicing like this, then we will come to the point where we can say that no matter how obstructed the mind gets with dualities I can come out of that and see reality and see the truth of the situation just as it is, that we're not caught in that duality. We can come back to a state of unity. So the Eightfold Noble Path, or the Eightfold Noble Method, is something that we can do right here, right now. All we have to do is have the key The key is to remember to take a look means to put the key in the door, and then to make a change means to turn that latch and the door opens into reality. Immediately this happens, but we have to keep practicing it over and over and over and over again because somehow or another we keep slamming that door in our own face. We keep going back into duality. It's our habit. And so we have to practice coming back again into reality and practice over and over and over again until we get good at it. And when we get really good at it, that's when the Buddha talks about the true unification of mind. The mind becomes unified and whole because it stays real. By staying real, that means we stay in— and Eric Byrne's speech would be in the adult. Now, the parent that I was mentioning, Eric Byrne calls that the parent ego state that has all the shoulds, woulds, coulds, all the things that should be, all the idealism. And then the child is that reptilian part of the brain which controls our feelings of liking and not liking, and that we in fact can use the frontal cortex, the adult, to see that and to start to change our reptilian brain and start changing our temporal cortex or the mammalian brain. So the human brain is divided into three parts. So this is why I'm saying that it's not really a duality, it's a trinity. But if we stay in the adult mental state, looking at how things are as real rather than developing our desires of what we want it to be, are stuck in our states of how things should be. If we can come out of how things should be and how we want them to be and come back into reality. This is unity, and we can do that. We can do it anytime that we remember to do it, and as we keep doing it, we'll get better and better at it. So the key point is to become satisfied with this present moment. If you're satisfied with this present moment, you've got everything that the Buddha teaches. The Buddha teaches Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means dissatisfaction, and come out of that into a state of satisfaction. When you're in the state of satisfaction, you've got everything that the Buddha teaches. Enlightenment is not way out there. Enlightenment is just having a light heart right now. Enlightenment is not to drop a big burden someday. Is to drop your burdens right now. So in fact, future Buddhism is part of duality, and present Buddhism is unification. Just to come to this present moment and be here the way things are is okay. We actually live in a paradise if we could only see it that way. Just recognize, hey, this is good enough. Now there's another kind of duality, and that duality is, is that we want to know how to practice the Dharma correctly. And a lot of people will have a lot of doubt about it and want to know this and want to go read suttas and want to go read more books and figure it out, and then they'll practice correctly. Well, that's the duality. When I do this then I can practice. No, you don't need to know anything much. All you need to know is you've got a choice. Make that choice right now. Come out of your Dukkha right now into a state of joy. Brett, you had a question or a comment?

**Speaker C:** No questions.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, yes you did.

**Speaker C:** Okay, not a question. I was merely going to postpinned to your skillful statement that— did not the Buddha say— and I believe he did say that the future is unmade.

**Speaker A:** The what?

**Speaker C:** The future is unmade.

**Speaker A:** Right? It doesn't exist. And whatever it is when it comes, it ain't going to be what you dreamt it up to be.

**Speaker C:** No matter what you dream, it won't be that.

**Speaker A:** No matter what you dream, it's not going to happen like that. Something else going to happen. An example of that was the election. Everybody thought that we were going to have a winner or loser. Oh no, we have two winners and two losers. And there's a story about that. Mullah Nasruddin was known— the police, I mean, on the town square He had a little shop, and at lunch he always went to the same little shop. And right across there was the police station. And this cop watched Mullah Nasruddin every day at lunchtime, would leave his shop and go to the cafe. And so to play a trick on him, the cop came out and says, Mullah Nasruddin, where are you going? And he says, I don't know, I don't know. And the cop says, well, of course you know, you're going over to the cafe. And the motorist says, not sure. And so the cop got angry and arrested him and took him to the police station. And as they were entering the police station, Nasruddin said, see, I told you, I didn't know where I was going. So this is what the future is. Just you've done it a thousand times doesn't make that that's what's going to happen. So always have that statement about the future is not sure, don't know what's going to happen. What we do know is that no matter what happens, I can handle it. Because the victim's attitude is, oh, I want to know the future so I can get ready because it may be terrible. But if we have that winner's attitude, I don't care what happens, I can handle it. Therefore, I'm unsure and I'm unconcerned about the future. Yes, Edward, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I got a question.

**Speaker C:** How do you tell the difference between wholesome desire and unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Desire? Well, guess what? You wouldn't necessarily call it desire. Desire is what you want, and if you want something you don't have, it's not wholesome. You're in a state of suffering. You're in a state of Dukkha. You're in a state of being dissatisfied. So I wouldn't say that there's such a thing as wholesome desire. That's almost like a duality. There is such a thing though as wise desire, and what we would mean by wise desire is let's only want things that are immediately available. If you want something and it's immediately available, then you get it, and then you're— you got what you wanted, and now you're in a state of satisfaction again. So I would not say that there is such a thing as good desire, because good desires that you don't have is going to keep you in suffering. And you're lying to yourself when you say that they're good, because here you are in reality, you're dissatisfied because you didn't get what you wanted, even if you thought it was good. In fact, everything that we want we think is good It's not possible to want something that's bad. Even the kid who wants to sneak out of school, he knows that there is a rule against it. He will say, yes, it's bad to sneak out of school, but when he wants to sneak out of school, he thinks that sneaking out of school is good. So in reality, there's no such thing as a bad desire. We don't want bad things, we want to avoid bad things. The question is places do we see how we create good and bad. Because good and bad is another duality. That in fact, we can go so far as to say that good and bad have a method of production. If you like something, if you want it, you will determine that it is good because you want it. And if you dislike something and want it to not be here, then you will automatically determine it to be bad. That's where all the world's goods and bads come from. They— it comes from feelings of liking and not liking. There is the real wisdom is, is that, uh, liking and not liking makes up whether things are good or bad. All right, I've got several stories about that. One of them is, is that the farmer had a horse and a teenage son. The horse ran away from the farm. Was that good or bad? No answers. Okay, so the horse comes back with a mare. Was that good or bad? Now the boy decides that he's going to train the mare. Is that good or bad? When he's training the mare, he breaks his leg. Is that good or bad? While his leg was broken, the military came for conscripts and they took everybody, every kid in town except him. They didn't take him because he had a broken leg. Was that good?— or bad? Now that he's the only boy in town, guess where the girls are going. Is that good or bad? You see where this is going? You can't determine whether things are good or bad because you don't know what the future is going to be. So how can we determine what's good and what's bad? All we can do is recognize what we like and what we don't like. And when we create good and bad, we're creating the duality rather than just living in the horse ran away, the horse came back, the boy trained the mare, the mare broke his leg, the military came and they didn't take him, and now the girls want him, right? These are just facts. That's reality. The good and the bad of it is something that we make up. That's our delusion. That's when we create the duality. That's a good question. Thanks for asking. Did you guess my joke? So does anybody else have any questions? Brett, you're always good for a.

**Speaker C:** Good question. None come to mind.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's good. I'm going to tell that joke too many times, people are actually going to.

**Speaker C:** Catch on.

**Speaker A:** I guess I have a follow-up.

**Speaker C:** Question. Yes. You said if you can't immediately get.

**Speaker A:** It, then it's unwise.

**Speaker C:** If you can't what? If you can't immediately get it, it's unwise to want it, right? Could you be equanimous about wanting something in the future that's far away, like a house or something?

**Speaker A:** Well, let it be far away in the future.

**Speaker C:** But you could be equanimous, like it's.

**Speaker A:** Okay if I get it or not, right? Okay, so here's the way to look at it, is that I can be happy going out shopping for land, because that's all I'm doing. I have no intention of buying land. I can just shop for it, and then I find a piece of land and I can start the process of buying it. But I don't have to have the goal of buying it. Maybe it's not going to work out. Maybe the banker doesn't want me to buy the land. But if I happen to buy the land, now what am I going to do? Well, I can just let that land sit. It's good enough as it is. And then the wife wants to build a house. Okay, well, let her build it. She wants to build the house, and so she goes and finds a contractor. But that's all she's doing. She goes and looks for a contractor, and she can do that happily. And if she finds a contractor— you see, you've got a 'I want a house' way out there in the future instead of looking at what we're doing right now. Step by step. Pay attention to the steps you take, not have the long goal, because that's going to lead to Dukkha. But in fact, you can see that with the monks when they're out on Vendabhat. When they're out on Vendabhat going on alms round, they're not intending to get food. They're intending to walk where they're looking and look where they're walking. And if there happens to be people standing beside the road that's going to give them food, then they can stop and turn and allow the person to put the goods in the bowl. But they don't have to want what's there, they can just allow it to happen, and then they continue on. And maybe they didn't get anything in their bowl that they wanted, but they got enough to eat. So this is the way you start looking at it, is to look at what you can do right now. Stay in the present moment, because wanting things you don't have is going to cause dissatisfaction. So don't want things that are far away, only want things that are really close. One step at a time. All the way down to I don't want to get that loan from the bank, I just merely want to get out to my car. Good, I got to the car. Now what am I going to do? Well, I'm going to crank it up. It may not crank up, but it did crank up. So now I can start driving, going in the direction of the bank. I may not make it to the bank, but that's okay. I'm just going in the direction of the bank. If I don't make it to the bank, that's okay. And then let's say that I make it to the bank and now the banker is really busy because there's 10 guys who's wanting a loan. If I really want that loan, I'm going to be miserable while he's dealing with other 10 people. But in fact, I can go to the coffee shop or I can sit in, uh, the office. In fact, I can have a whole lot of joy at looking at the interior of the bank, especially since I've been there before, and I can compare— oh, they moved that chair, or that mural has been changed, or maybe that door is open now and the last time I was here it was closed— and just stay in the present moment. And then when the banker is there for you, you can talk to him without any expectations of him saying yes or no. You can just present what you've got to say. So breaking everything down to tiny little pieces that you're doing right here, right now, and doing it with equanimity. But if you want that house way off into the future, then that's the desire. And you say, I would be better off with that house, which means that you're not good enough right now. That's the Dukkha, that's the dissatisfaction right there. So the wise way of doing it is want things that are immediately available to you and forget about the long-term plan. Or not necessarily forget about it, but stop wanting it. Does that make sense for.

**Speaker C:** You.

**Speaker A:** Edward? Yeah. Anybody else? Alexander? This fits in with what you've been talking about. What do.

**Speaker C:** You think? I think it sounds like a better way.

**Speaker A:** To go. All right, does anybody else have any questions? How about you, uh, Lawrence?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, um, this sort of sounds familiar to me. I've heard a lot.

**Speaker C:** Of similar, uh.

**Speaker B:** What do you call it? I don't know, philosophy, or, uh, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's all good philosophy, by the way, is trying to make sense out of something that you don't know. It's kind of better just to not know it. And modern philosophy is not philosophy at all, is reading books about philosophers who are all.

**Speaker B:** Dead now. Well, is Jimi Hendrix still lives.

**Speaker A:** On though? He's dead.

**Speaker B:** But I was just listening.

**Speaker A:** To him. No, you were listening to a recording. So anyway, what's your question?

**Speaker B:** Oh, question? Oh yeah, you know, I don't know, I was thinking about Buddha. Didn't like, um, is— was Buddha Rama.

**Speaker A:** The founder of Zen? I don't know. Well, I don't think there was one person.

**Speaker B:** Finds anything. So when Buddha went to China, he met with the emperor and, uh, are.

**Speaker A:** You talking about Bodhidharma from the 5th century? Yeah, yeah, well, he never went to Japan, and Zen is a word they use in Japan. So you couldn't say that he founded Zen. He went to China. Chan— the word Chan came later.

**Speaker B:** They say that Zen is the Japanese.

**Speaker A:** Version of Chan, right? Yeah, but Chan actually has an Indian word, is actually the word for John.

**Speaker B:** Or Jhana. Yeah. But anyways, so Buddha Dharma, he went to China and he met with the emperor and the emperor said, "I built all these temples and I'm promoting Buddhism, so what merit have I got?".

**Speaker A:** And Buddha Dharma said, "There's no merit." There's no merit.

**Speaker B:** So then the emperor became angry and he says, "Well, who are you?".

**Speaker A:** And he says, "I don't know." Okay. That's right, you don't know who you are. That in fact you might have a personality, but your personality is not fixed. Most people identify themselves as my personality, and they talk about it, but in fact the personality is changing. And if you're an old Dhamma dude like Buddha Dhamma, then it's changing so much that you can't even pin yourself down. Here's an example of that. You today, this afternoon or tonight or maybe tomorrow, write down as much as you can on a piece of paper that defines who you are. Put it away, and next month come back and do that same task a second time. And then a month later, bring those two pages out and compare them to find out that you now don't agree with either one of them, and they're both in disagreement with each other. Because why? Because you've changed. Even in a month's time, you change.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's, that's like, um, meditation. Like, I observed, um, the end of all phenomenon, because all phenomena are transient. Uh, so I can just imagine, like, everything is transient It's kind of a.

**Speaker A:** Scary thing sometimes, right? I'm interested in that word phenomena because there is no such thing as phenomena. What there is.

**Speaker B:** Is observation. Well, the phenomenon is like I'm here, but tomorrow I'm not, uh, you know, I could be somewhere else.

**Speaker A:** Well, how do you know you're here? I assume, right? That's an assumption based upon an observation. So in fact, it's both observation and perception.

**Speaker B:** Not phenomena. But it's kind of abstract. So if I go for a job interview, I just pretend that I'm here, because if I said I wasn't here, then they might not hire me, though.

**Speaker A:** Right. But another way of doing it is that if you go to that job interview and have fun with the interviewer, he'll probably give you the job. And if you go with the attitude, I'm on an interview and I got to do it right, he'll probably not give you the job. So don't go on interviews, just go have fun. Go meet a new person who thinks that he's an employer or an HR.

**Speaker B:** Staff member. Yeah, it's good to try to have fun, right? But, uh, I don't know if it is fun, a phenomenon or not though.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. I mean, it is based upon whether you are in a state of satisfaction and delight, or whether you're in a state of fear, trepidation, wanting something like a job that you.

**Speaker B:** Don'T have.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, why do people go on interviews, Michael? Answer that. Why do people go on interviews? It's because they want something. They want that job. And wanting that job is probably going to keep them from getting it. But if the guy can go on the interview just to have fun, to enjoy himself, then he'll probably get the job. I don't need that job. I don't need that job. I'm here to have fun. I got a story to tell you. In fact, this is an old story from years ago. You know, people have, um, strange hobbies sometimes. One of the hobbies that I had was that I would go on interviews for a job I did not want, just to show off to myself that they wanted me, when I in fact didn't want the job at all. And I was pretty good at getting employed, or getting a job offer, and then turning it down. There was in fact a time when I went to California. I was living in North Carolina at the time, and I flew to California into San Diego. In fact, I had a marvelous this weekend. They paid for it all, and in the interview they offered me a job, and I turned it down. I didn't want the job.

**Speaker B:** Well, even if you don't want the job, if you interview, at least you're practicing, like you're talking.

**Speaker A:** And you're— yeah, right. That was, that was an earlier me. I don't go on interviews now to get joy. I can sit right here at the desk and say, oh yeah, I remembered I used to go on interviews just for the joy of getting the job that I didn't even want. So that's the way to go get a job, is don't want it. Let them want you. Sorry, but you brought.

**Speaker B:** Up jobs. I've been looking for a job.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, you know, well, don't go looking for one, just go to an interview and have fun at it.

**Speaker B:** I know, but I, what I, I have to spend all on the internet and studying and applying and sending out resumes, and that's what I, I spend time doing.

**Speaker A:** I mean It's fine. Well, as far as I know, sending out interviews is a good way to not get a job, because the HR people, they don't want to go through the stack of interviews to figure out who they're going to interview. No, go through an employer, what we called a headhunter. Let the headhunter sell you, or sell you into getting that interview, and then go have the interview and enjoy it. But sending out resumes, I don't think anybody's gotten a job by sending out 10,000 resumes. And what do you want? Oh, I need that job, I'll send out another interview and another resume and another resume. By the way, the same thing happens on these dating sites. It's exactly the same thing. If you want a girl, you can't have one. If the girl wants you, now you've got— so don't want a girl. That's why the girls have all the boys chasing them. That's because the girls are trained properly. They're trained to not want a boy. The boys want the girls, and so the boys are the ones who do without. They're the ones who suffer. So turn that around, do the Sadie Hawkins bit, and don't want the girl. And if you don't want a girl, they'll come flocking. But if you want them too much, you're suffering, and they can see how bad you suffer. You want a girl so bad, that's not attractive. That's not attractive, right? Being in a state of desperation is not attractive. Being on top of the world, that's attractive.

**Speaker C:** People want to get with that when you're happy. When you're playing, when you're joyful, others want to be near you.

**Speaker A:** So this is the whole point that I'm making here, is go not just to interviews and not just on dates, but go your whole life as if you already had everything you wanted. Go to life being satisfied, and your life will be wonderful. And if you go looking for something and desiring something, you're going to be miserable. You're not going to get what you want. That's the loser's mentality, is out wanting stuff. Yes, Brad, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Okay, this question is for Lawrence. Uh, you mentioned kung fu earlier. In karate or something like that.

**Speaker B:** Do you practice martial arts? Well, I've been to a studio where Calvin Chen's studio and he teaches kung fu and tai chi. I'm one of the oldest students, but I'm not one of the serious students. I haven't been in a while, but I want to start going again. I developed a problem with my foot. I like to hike, but I don't know if I might start going to I like going in the winter because in the wintertime it's hard to get motivated to be outdoors, so you end up going to the gym more. I ride my bike for exercise, but even in the winter I ride my bike. You talk about having joy, I mean, I have joy that riding my bike makes me healthy, but I don't really enjoy riding my bike when it's 30 degrees out, or I guess I try to, but, uh, you know, I don't live in the tropics here, uh, so I'm just, you know, I can have a positive attitude, say, well, you know, at least I don't live in Alaska.

**Speaker A:** I don't live in Siberia.

**Speaker C:** Or you can bask in the enjoyment when you get through your bike ride and you get home and you're in the warm house. But I wanted to ask you, have you gotten to the point— sorry, Do.

**Speaker A:** You need to— let me interject one little point. Yeah, let me interject one little thing. Please do. All right, Lawrence, you ride your bicycle and that makes you healthy is not correct. You like— you ride the bicycle because you like riding the bicycle, and you're healthy because you like being healthy. If you didn't like the riding the bicycle, you wouldn't ride it. If you thought you were unhealthy, you could ride a bicycle that you don't want to ride forever and you're still not healthy. Healthy is an attitude. Well, I mean, people can have multiple sclerosis and still have the attitude that they're okay. Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what it is. A whole lot of healthy people are out there going to the doctor one after another after another because they have the attitude that they're not healthy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't understand how other people operate, but, but I know that if I, if I get my heart rate going and I, and I get moving on my bicycle, then I feel relaxed and I sleep better.

**Speaker A:** I don't understand. Yeah, and here I am sitting on my butt, and I'm sitting on my butt, and I feel relaxed and healthy, and I don't need to ride a bicycle to be relaxed and healthy. You are, you are using the bicycle as an excuse for you being okay and healthy and relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I'm like a Martian or something. I don't really fit with Earth people or something.

**Speaker A:** I don't understand it. Well, what I'm getting at is your attitude is more important than riding the bicycle, because people can ride the bicycle and still.

**Speaker C:** Feel miserable.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, I mean, that's some, you know, psychological aspect of like, uh, yeah, like your state of mind But, uh, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** So this is what we're practicing here, is change your state of mind.

**Speaker B:** Bicycle optional, right? Generally though, I, I feel like it helps me to ride a bicycle. I can't totally explain it, but, uh.

**Speaker A:** Well, you haven't even tried not riding a bicycle and still being healthy. You've already had gotten an addiction to the bicycle makes you healthy. Seems like it. It's not the bicycle makes you healthy, it's your attitude. Now if you say, oh, because I haven't been riding my bicycle I'm not as healthy, that's still a change of attitude. It's not the bicycle itself. You're using the bicycle as a method for feeling good, which is the one-two punch. This is the duality. It's not the bicycle that makes you healthy, it's your own mind that makes you healthy. This is the unification we've been talking about this whole hour.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I guess, but, uh, so it's, it's a body-mind thing, kind of, in a way. But, uh, I don't know, I mean, I was gonna say, uh, I know what you're saying, but I was gonna say, like, I ride my bicycle for an hour and then I take it, it makes me tired, and then I have a nap, and, and that nap just feels good, like.

**Speaker A:** You know. Yeah, I can take a nap and feel good, and I don't have to ride a bicycle to.

**Speaker B:** Do it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's really amazing. No, it's practice of the Dhamma. It's not amazing. I'm not in a maze. All right, go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker C:** Now he's back to you. Yeah, so Lawrence, the thrust of where I was headed with my question or comments was that, have you gotten to the point where you've sparred with opponents yet in the dojo in your karate, kung fu? Well, because that can be a movement of play. In other words, you don't have to win or even be concerned with winning, and then you can't lose. In every fight, have joy, take it upon it as play. You don't have to be uptight, no worries. Yeah, you're gonna get hit, maybe you're gonna get kicked, that's part of the game. And not like you're trying to avoid getting hit, you're just, you're dancing, you're having fun, you're joining with your opponent, it's play. And I think if you do that, there's nothing you can't accomplish in that and enjoy it in the process. And you can transform that, and it won't be caught on a duality of win-lose, praise-blame, pass-fail. It'll just be play and enjoyable, and that's Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Am I wrong? Yeah, I mean, Chinese martial arts is described as a soft martial art, and it's like an exercise, like, in a way. I think karate is more of a hard martial art, although I don't know about Aikido. As far as I know, but I think there's an interesting thing about Kung Fu and Tai Chi is that there's all complex movements in the body, so you're supposedly activating, you're moving your body in ways that you normally wouldn't. Like if I go surfing, I'm just paddling with my arms. If I ride my bike, I'm mostly moving my legs. When you do Kung Fu, you're moving all different parts of your body. And I'm 62. I consider myself too old to be fighting anybody, but I did get attacked in a bar a number of years ago when I was at my friend's band was playing. And I didn't really do any moves. I just decided I was going to pretend that I was Jackie Chan or somebody. And I didn't really know what I was doing, but it looked like kung fu. And then I got thrown out of the bar. I was on top of the guy hitting him and I was saying, get this 'Get this guy off me,' but I was on top of him hitting him, and I was yelling, 'Get this guy off me.' And so they get thrown out of the bar, and that was the end of.

**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker C:** But, uh, that might have been an attitude that the mind is the forerunner there.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, I have a surefire way of winning every bar fight. Don't go.

**Speaker B:** To bars. I don't go as much. I mean, at my age, I don't go. No, no.

**Speaker A:** Hear what I'm saying. If you don't go anywhere near a fight, you've already won.

**Speaker B:** Well, I play. I'm a musician, so I play guitar. So sometimes I want to go see a band, but I would rather, you know, stay out of trouble. I don't know why this guy attacked me anyways. It was a— he just didn't like the way I looked or something, and I hadn't— I never even saw.

**Speaker A:** Him before.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they do sparring at the martial arts academy. I don't really— I don't even do the sparring stuff. I just do the I would do the movements and stuff, and it's so complicated, all this martial arts. I'm not— some people at the school, I mean, they go to Hong Kong and they get on planes, and I kind of go to class once in a while, and then it's warm out and I go somewhere else, and when it's cold out again, then I want to— I'm like, I can't go, it's too cold to go for a hike, so I'm going to go to the martial arts studio or something. Like, you know, or whatever it may be. So I find it interesting. I actually have an interest in the Buddhist connection to kung fu. A lot of the people, they don't really go at it that angle. I mean, I thought it was interesting about Buddha, Dharma, and I did a Toastmasters speech on Buddha, Dharma, and studied some of that. And I I gave a speech on Buddhism and all the different types of Buddhism and how it's connected to martial arts.

**Speaker A:** And so actually, Buddhism is not connected to martial arts. You could say that martial arts connects itself to Buddhism. Yeah, but a good Buddhist doesn't get into fights. A grandmaster at the dojo, whether it's kung fu, the grandmaster also doesn't get into fights. The Grand Master does something else. He doesn't get into fights. What he does do is that he plays, he teaches, he does katas. It's still good, but he doesn't fight. Now let me continue with this for just a moment. Dojos and, um, what we have nowadays is what's called a sport. In the old days, the martial arts was real in the sense that it was warfare. And generally the way that it worked is the first punch, somebody dies. The whole fight is one punch. Sports is punch after punch after punch that doesn't work. Now The point is, is that a lot of people— I mean, let's take it, the example would be kittens roll and tumble, little puppies they'll roll and tumble, lion cubs will roll and tumble and play at fighting, children roll and play at fighting. Real warfare is different from going to the modern dojo, because the modern dojo is now a sport, which actually they call it a play. They play at it. They don't hurt each other. That if somebody gets hurt, the fight is kind of over. And so the whole point is, is that it's your mentality. If you have the mentality of playing, then you can be like the kittens and just play. But when you start to make it real, that's when it goes bad. For instance, two children can play chess, but if one of them grows up to be a grandmaster, then now it's real and they've got emotions in it, and they'll harm each other. They'll play psychological games with each other. Same thing happens on the football field. When the kids are playing football at the age of 5 and 6 and 8 and 10 and whatnot, it's still a game. But the NFL is not a game. That's war. It's just got rules.

**Speaker B:** That's how come I quit football, because when I was in 8th grade, I was having a lot of fun. And then when I got to varsity, the coach, all he did was yell at us and make us run around the field and hit us and everything.

**Speaker A:** And I get— that's because he was at war. He didn't want you to have fun. He wanted you to win. So winning is when it is warfare, and play is when it's real. War is duality— this team against this team, win-lose. And when you're playing together, there's no winners and no losers. So this is the teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha's teaching is let's stop making it a war, let's stop the competition, let's just start having fun together. No war is necessary. Everything is a game that's harmless, and there are no winners and no losers other than people enjoying the game. And if you're enjoying the game, then you're the winner. And if you want to win, you're the loser. And so that coach that you were talking about, he was a loser. That's why he worked you guys so hard, is because he wanted to be a winner. That was desire. He was in the state of being dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** I wasn't happy either because I didn't like the situation, but I had to quit, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, what I'm hoping for is for you to come out of the story and start listening to what I'm actually saying. So just use that as an example of that. War is when we're trying to make it real because we have desire. That's Dukkha. And the whole teaching of the Buddha is to come out of that into a much more happy, playful attitude that don't make it real in that sense, because playing is real and fighting.

**Speaker B:** Is duality. Yeah, I know it makes sense. And, uh, it reminds me of, um, in Chinese martial arts, you try to relax, right? So if you, if you get upset or angry, emotional, then it, it can throw you off balance. And precisely, it reminds me of the Bhagavad Gita actually talks about warfare, but it points out like that you can be like in a war without having to be emotionally disturbed. Like, like just like a soldier, like.

**Speaker A:** He'S in a war, but it's not a war. That's the whole point. When your attitude changes, you're not in a war. The people who see it as a war, they're the ones who feel bad. They don't like it.

**Speaker B:** You're not in a war, but you could still have like weapons.

**Speaker A:** And well, whether you're in the war or not is the attitude. Please understand what I'm saying. War is an attitude. Play is an attitude. If you can change your attitude about life so that you stop warring with reality and stop warring with other people and just enjoy the show Now you're going to have real happiness. Real happiness comes when things are no longer important and you're just having fun. That's the teaching of the Buddha, is to stop making things important, stop creating a reality that's different from what's actually real. And what's actually real is humans can get along really well together. We could be happy together, but when people want stuff, then they start wars. And this whole planet doesn't need a war. We don't need one tank, we don't need one missile, we don't need one, uh, nuclear weapon. We don't need any of that stuff. But the reason why they exist is because people want stuff. And when people would stop wanting stuff and just be happy, we wouldn't need any war machines at all. We wouldn't need police. We'd just all get along together happily. But that's not going to happen. There's going to be too many people who have that attitude of I want and I want and I want. We're taught I want. Children dress up in military uniforms. They're taught to be patriots. They're taught to want stuff. Who are they taught to want stuff by? The ones who want stuff. Just like that coach that you were talking about, he wanted something, and because he wanted something, he was miserable. And good, he made you miserable and all the other students miserable also. And he could have been happy. He could have sat at home and watched NFL and had a ball. But oh no, he's out there wanting to win some game of his own. And so when we can come out of that wanting and out of that desire— and oftentimes the grand martial artist is the one who finally comes to the point that he doesn't want to fight anymore. It's only the idiots that are the students who want to fight. They're the ones who want to know the martial arts. The ones who are grand masters at it They don't want to fight anymore. They're having too much fun enjoying their life. So can you start, Brett? Can you start just enjoying your life and stop the war in your own mind? So that's the duality, is wanting to win, wanting to have a war. And unity is when everybody's already won, there's no problem. How about you, Alexander? You ready to stop the war between you and your wife and everybody else? Yes. Yeah. How about you, Dhammarato? You're ready to stop the war and just be happy? Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So I know that this Lawrence is new to you. But this is the way of the teaching of the Buddha, is to stop wanting stuff and just be happy. Stop creating the duality of winners and losers and just get along. Everything's already okay, not a problem in the world. Everybody is okay. Michael, do you have any last words.

**Speaker C:** To say? Just.

**Speaker A:** A peace. Brett, you got your hand up. What's your.

**Speaker C:** Last words? One thing we don't have to want because it's always here until the day we die is this very breath, and it's really nice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is the only thing that we need is the next breath. That's the only thing that we need. Everything else is optional. All right guys, well thank you so much. This has been a good talk. I especially appreciate your input, Lawrence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thanks.

**Speaker C:** Good to talk to you. Thanks, man.

**Speaker B:** Nice to meet you. Yeah, everyone, uh, watching this on YouTube.

**Speaker A:** Have a good one.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on moving from a state of **duality** (suffering) to **unity** (satisfaction) by applying the Buddha's core teachings in a direct, practical way. Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: From Duality to Unity**
*   **Duality** is the state of mind that creates suffering (*dukkha*). It arises from comparing reality against our ideals, desires, rules, and stories (e.g., "how things *should* be" vs. "how they *are*"). This includes dwelling on the past/future, blaming others, and wanting what we don't have.
*   **Unity** is the state of satisfaction, peace, and "enlightenment." It is found only in the **present moment**, by accepting reality as it is, without adding our mental commentary, judgments, or desires.
*   **Key Insight:** Anyone *talking about* non-duality is still in duality. True unity is a lived experience, not a philosophical discussion.

### **The Buddha's Teaching Simplified: *Dukkha* and Its End**
The entire teaching is framed as **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"** (dissatisfaction, its cause, its cessation).
1.  **First Noble Truth (Dukkha):** Dissatisfaction exists. This is the duality between reality and our wants/ideals.
2.  **Second Noble Truth (Cause):** **We create our own *dukkha*** through our desires, aversions, and delusions. We cannot blame external people or events. The liberating corollary is: you can't fix anyone else, and no one can fix you—only you can change your own mind.
3.  **Third Noble Truth (Cessation):** Ending dissatisfaction and entering unity **is possible immediately**. It is not a distant goal but a present-moment choice to drop burdens and be satisfied. Enlightenment is "having a light heart right now."

### **Practical Method: The "Noble Method" (Eightfold Path)**
*   Framed not as a long **path** (which implies a future goal, a duality), but as a **method** for immediate application.
*   **The Key:** **Remember to be here now (*Sati*)**. Investigate reality through your senses, especially touch, which grounds you in the present.
*   **The Process:** When you notice a dualistic, unwholesome thought (e.g., "I hate the IRS"), recognize it as a mental creation. Then, **choose** to change your attitude to a wholesome one by coming back to the present reality ("The IRS is not here right now. Everything is okay.").
*   **Practice:** This is a skill developed through repetition. We habitually slip back into duality, but each moment of recognition is an opportunity to choose unity again.

### **Important Clarifications & Examples**
*   **Desire:** All desire for what you don't have creates *dukkha*. "Wise desire" is only for what is immediately available. Break big goals into tiny, present-moment steps done with equanimity.
*   **Good/Bad:** These are dualistic judgments created by our "liking" or "disliking." Reality is just facts; we add the story of good or bad. We can't know if an event is ultimately "good" or "bad" because we don't know the future.
*   **Play vs. Work/ War:** **Play** is the attitude of unity—engaging without attachment to results, thus finding joy in the activity itself. **Work/War** is the attitude of duality—being attached to outcomes, winning, and ideals, which leads to stress and conflict. This applies to everything from job interviews to sports to spiritual practice.
*   **The "Trinity":** Duality is often a three-part conflict: 1) Reality, 2) How it's "supposed to be" (rules, parent ego), and 3) What we want (desires, child ego). Unity is the "adult" ego that sees and accepts reality clearly.

### **Conclusion: The Invitation**
The talk is an invitation to stop the internal war with reality. By letting go of wants, judgments, and stories, we can see that **"everything is already okay."** Paradise is not a place but a perspective available right now, found in the simplicity of the present moment and the very next breath. The practice is to continually choose satisfaction and unity, moment by moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and illustrative stories** to explain the abstract concepts of duality, non-duality, and Buddhist practice. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Door to Unity:** The path to a unified, satisfied mind is not a long journey but a door right in front of you. You just need the "key" (remembering to be present) to unlock it and step through immediately.
    *   *Purpose:* To counter the idea that enlightenment is a distant goal and emphasize its immediate accessibility.

2.  **Work vs. Play:** This is a central metaphor for the state of mind.
    *   **Work** represents duality—action performed with expectation of a specific result, leading to stress and dissatisfaction.
    *   **Play** represents unity/non-duality—action done for its own sake, in the present moment, without attachment to outcomes, leading to joy.
    *   *Purpose:* To illustrate the fundamental attitude shift from goal-oriented striving to present-moment engagement.

3.  **The Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spook):** Used to complicate the simple duality model.
    *   **The Father:** Rules, laws, "how things *should* be" (Ten Commandments, societal norms).
    *   **The Son:** The inner child with its desires, "how I *want* things to be."
    *   **The Holy Spook (Spirit):** Reality itself, "how things *actually* are."
    *   *Purpose:* To show that conflict (dukkha) arises from the gap between reality (Spirit) and our mental constructs of rules (Father) and desires (Son).

4.  **Catching and Eating:** "If you can't catch it, you can't eat it." If you can't see/observe your dissatisfaction and unwholesome thoughts, you can't change them. Awareness is the prerequisite for transformation.
    *   *Purpose:* To stress the importance of mindfulness as the first step.

5.  **The Kamma Machine vs. Choice:** Rejects the view of karma as a deterministic machine of cause and effect. Instead, frames it as a habit of repeating past patterns, which can be broken by a simple **choice** to step out of that cycle.
    *   *Purpose:* To empower the listener, emphasizing agency and the possibility of immediate change over fatalism.

6.  **Sensory Metaphors:**
    *   **Dogs (Smell) vs. Humans (Sight):** Contrasts how different beings primarily experience the world to argue that human reliance on sight leads to creating mental images/stories that separate us from direct, tactile reality.
    *   **Touch as Primary:** Positions touch (over sight) as the most important sense for experiencing raw reality, linking it to both discomfort and sensuality.
    *   *Purpose:* To argue that we live in a mental world of representations (duality) rather than direct sensory experience (unity).

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Farmer and the Horse (The Chinese Parable):** The story where each event (horse runs away, returns with a mare, son breaks his leg, etc.) is met with the farmer saying "good luck, bad luck, who knows?" It illustrates the folly of labeling events as inherently good or bad from our limited, dualistic perspective, as we cannot see the future ramifications.
    *   *Purpose:* To undermine the duality of "good vs. bad" and promote equanimity.

2.  **Mullah Nasruddin and the Cop:** Nasruddin, when asked where he's going, says "I don't know." When the cop arrests him for being difficult, Nasruddin says, "See? I told you I didn't know where I was going." This illustrates the uncertainty of the future and the trap of assuming we know what will happen.
    *   *Purpose:* To highlight the delusion of certainty about the future and to encourage an open, adaptable attitude ("I can handle whatever happens").

3.  **The Job Interview Anecdote:** The speaker shares a personal story of going on job interviews for jobs he didn't want, excelling at them, and turning down offers. This demonstrates the power of non-attachment and playfulness (not "wanting" the job) versus the neediness that often leads to failure.
    *   *Purpose:* To concretize the "work vs. play" and "desire leads to dukkha" metaphors in a modern context.

4.  **Bodhidharma and the Emperor:** Referenced by a listener, the story where the Emperor lists his good deeds and asks about merit. Bodhidharma replies, "No merit." This jolts the Emperor out of a transactional, dualistic view of spirituality (good deed = reward).
    *   *Purpose:* To challenge the dualistic, score-keeping mindset in spiritual practice.

5.  **The Bar Fight Anecdote (Lawrence's Story):** Lawrence describes getting into a fight where he pretended to be a martial artist. The speaker's response reframes it: the surefire way to win every bar fight is "don't go to bars."
    *   *Purpose:* To emphasize that true wisdom and "winning" often mean avoiding the dualistic conflict altogether, not just succeeding within its framework.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose**
The metaphors and stories work together to:
*   **Demystify enlightenment,** portraying it as an immediate choice rather than a distant achievement.
*   **Make abstract philosophy (duality/non-duality) relatable** through everyday examples (jobs, sports, relationships).
*   **Empower the listener** by shifting focus from fixing the external world to changing one's internal perspective.
*   **Critique cultural constructs** (religion, history, laws) as "made up" dualities that distract from present reality.
*   **Promote a life of playful, satisfied engagement with the present moment,** free from the burdens of desire, judgment, and rigid rules.
