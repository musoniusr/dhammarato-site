### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so it's good that students are getting practice. Eddie and I congratulate you for getting value out of it. The more you practice, the more you will recognize just how valuable it is. Buddha in fact calls it great fruit, great benefit. And if we continue to practice correctly, we will continue to gain in that great fruit and that benefit. But it's easy for students to slide back into their old habits, and so it's really valuable to check in on a regular basis both with a good teacher or a good friend, a Kaliya Metta, and also friends in the Sangha, that what we're wanting to develop is the, let us say, the mentality to stay in the Dhamma, to think about the Dhamma, to practice the Dhamma, to talk to others about the Dharma, to become immersed in the Dharma. And in fact, that's what the word stream entry means. Have you ever heard of that word, stream entry, or Srotapanna? Yes, that's what it means, is to become immersed in the Dharma, in the teaching of the Buddha. Now, the word Dharma has a wider variety, a wider context in the sense that everything is Dharma, and that it's especially everything is Dharma when we pay attention to it in reference to the teaching of the Buddha. And so that you can see the Dharma everywhere. Whenever you're around people who are miserable and fussing and all of that kind of stuff, wanting to argue, you can see there's the Dhamma. There are unwholesome thoughts. And also, when you're around members of the Sangha, ones who are practicing nobility, then you can see in them, yeah, there it is, I can see the Dhamma. And so looking at the Dhamma, seeing the Dhamma everywhere, one of the references that I make on a regular basis is that we all live in paradise. Just some of us know it, some of us don't. But that paradise is Dhamma, and you either know that you're in the Dhamma, that you're in paradise, or you don't. And most people have spent their whole lives trying to seek paradise, trying to find something, and are quite unhappy and miserable sometimes because they can't get what they want. But when we stop wanting and looking for what we want, we recognize already that we're in Paradise. But we have to also be reminded of that on a regular basis until it's really ingrained, until that becomes what you could call second nature. The habit is that everything is okay. The habit is that we're in a paradise. Everything is fine, everything is okay, not a worry in the world. And so we practice that to ingrain that, to instill that in the mind, and to come out of our unwholesome thoughts into happy, wholesome thoughts over and over and over again. When we're in seclusion, and then when we leave seclusion, we want to seek out others who have that same mentality, that same attitude. Because if you're around ordinary people, those ordinary people are going to work their best to try to convince you what a hellhole this world really is. And almost always they will succeed because you were raised that way. And so we have to practice coming out of that mentality and then spend time with others in that mentality. This is why the Buddha started the Sangha in the first place. And for 2,500 years, 2,600 years, there have been Literally hundreds of thousands, now in the millions. What I heard surprised me, that there's approximately on the planet Earth about 6 million ordained Buddhist monks and nuns from some country or another. And that's growing, and actually in China it's growing fast, because China at one time went through a cultural revolution where Mao Zedong did his best to destroy Buddhism. Guess what? He didn't quite do it very well. Many of the old temples that were hundreds and hundreds of years old have been rebuilt, many of them back to the way that they were, only better. But they look 500 or 600 years old, where they're actually— the building is only about 35 or 20 years old. So anyway, this enormous Sangha that we have available, uh, for people who are practicing in the West, they don't even know about it. They don't even know it exists, or they think that it's too foreign. And so what they do is buy their way into retreats, they buy books, they go online and talk to people on Reddit and all of that kind of stuff. Who are people who know a little bit about Buddhism, but they haven't really come to that point that they know that they live in paradise and that all is well. And so, uh, this is why it's good to find a real Sangha. We've got, uh, two groups on Skype and also on, uh, Discord, and we're getting a website together, and that in this website we have thousands of places where people can go to find that friendship, to find that Sangha, to find that noble friend that they're looking for, rather than looking in books and looking into retreats and all of that kind of stuff, which is basically business, that Buddhism in the West has been dressed up in a business suit. I know because you use that word that they use. That's the business suit crowd that use that word sits, to where Anapanasati can be practiced in any posture, in any position, anytime that you remember it, wherever you are. There you are, it's time to practice. But in order to get started, it's good to set aside time, about 10 minutes at a time, 5 or 6, 7 times a day, and really get into letting yourself be okay. No place to go, nothing to do, and I can relax. The job that needed to be done has been done. And all of those kind of wholesome thoughts. And pretty soon we begin to feel good.

**Speaker B:** I have a question on— you said that the 10 minutes, when the particular practice is quite enjoyable, it sometimes happens that I set a timer and 10 minutes is up, but naturally— Don't set a timer.

**Speaker A:** Turn the timer off.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Sit as long as you want to. Said, as long as it feels good to.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But people say, oh, I've got a busy life, I can't spend all day doing it. And the answer to that clearly is, don't have a busy life. Stop having a busy life and just sit down and just relax and enjoy yourself. That's one of the beautiful parts about being a monastic in the Sangha. Is you don't have any work to do. You can sit around all day and practice. Just practice being happy. So you don't need a clock to say, "Oh, my 10 minutes is up." That's not a good idea, because what that is actually is, is that, "Okay, now it's time to be miserable again." that in fact the real point is to get yourself into such a good mood that you're happy, that you're free from hindrances, that you can apply the mind to the wholesome state, sustain that, the body is relaxed, you feel good, you feel safe and secure and satisfied and ultimately successful. And once you get into that state, then The thing to do is to learn to walk around in that state, eventually learn to talk to people in that state, eventually learn to use the computer in that state. That being in that state— and by the way, the state that we're talking about, I just defined it. Let me go over the qualities again. Number 1 is you're free from the hindrances. There's no unwholesome thoughts. You're not worried. You're not restless, you're not full of questions and doubts, uh, you're not droggy or, uh, tired, you're not in a state of wanting something, you're not disgusted with anything, that you're okay. All right, that's freedom from the hindrances. And we keep applying the mind towards being free from the hindrances and then learn to sustain that. Applied, sustained, free from hindrances, and then we bring in that state of Sukkha. That state of Sukkha, by the way, is exactly opposite of the state of Dukkha. And that state of Sukkha means that you feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. And satisfaction, by the way, is exactly what the Buddha teaches—dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha—to come out of our dissatisfaction into a state of satisfaction. That's all he teaches. But wow, what would the world be like if most of the people walking around were walking around in a state of satisfaction? There wouldn't be much shopping done because people are already satisfied, they got everything they want, they don't buy much. They don't argue with each other because they're already satisfied, they don't have to convince anybody of their argument in order to be satisfied, they're already satisfied. Wow, what a nice world this would be. People wouldn't bother to have standing armies because there's nobody to fight because everybody's satisfied with the way things are. Dictators wouldn't have much of a shot because dictators need to keep people poor and miserable so that they feel wonderful and satisfied by getting what the dictator gives them. But if people are already satisfied, then they don't care about a dictator or a politician. So getting around other people who are in that state of satisfaction will help you stay in that state of satisfaction and walk around in that state of satisfaction. And by the way, these things that I'm talking about— freedom from the hindrances, applying the mind to the wholesome, staying in the state of wholesome, having that state of satisfaction and joy, and also in a state of relaxation. That's the definition of the first Jhana. And so that's just walking around money, first Jhana, being in that state of satisfaction, getting around others who are in that state of satisfaction, because all those people who are not satisfied Misery loves company, so they want to pull you into their state of misery with them. And so it's better for you and many other beginners is to stay with people who are comfortable, happy, and satisfied. Doesn't that make sense? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It's certainly a very interesting one because, yeah, I've definitely observed, um, as using this practice, um, having less questions, feeling less desire to be reading Dharma books per se. And then the slippery side of it was kind of noticing and being aware that as that happens, sometimes the motivation to practice can then decrease. But it's being mindful of that. Hence, as I said earlier, why to keep touching base and keep reminding myself.

**Speaker A:** That's why we want to have a little bit of formal practices, because I can talk to you and then you can go off and say, yeah, I'm going practice, and then you forget to because of the way the world is and the state of mind you're in. So we need to actually spend about an hour a day actually rehearsing feeling good, because look how much time you feel— not spend not feeling good. Yeah. So rehearse, rehearse, practice.

**Speaker B:** It's probably going to make for some short conversations with me, I think, because I don't really have too many questions, which is a good thing.

**Speaker A:** Great. Yes, that's great. That in fact not having a lot of questions is the right attitude to have, because having a lot of questions comes from the state of doubt, which is a hindrance. So when you don't have any questions, then you can just relax and feel good. And when you have questions, then to say, "Oh, look at that, I think that I will feel better if I get the answer to that question," and in fact you don't need to that answer in order to feel good. The questions are kind of irrelevant once you have the basics, just enough knowledge to feel good. And yet look how many Buddhists read all of these Buddhist books, write all of these Buddhist books. The library is enormous. I can imagine that there would be somewhere on the planet Earth a whole city library that's got nothing but Buddhist books in it. There's that many of them. Why? Because people were asking questions and doubtful and wanting answers that they didn't need. So you don't have to have a lot of— ask a lot of questions. Just be happy.

**Speaker B:** It's interesting as well because even as you're talking there, I see like 3 or 4 questions come up in my mind and I can drop them straight away because it doesn't really matter.

**Speaker A:** It don't matter until we begin to have fun with the Dharma. That's how we want to approach the suttas, is we're not looking for information, we're looking to enjoy. No problems, no worries, no doubts. Everything is all right. This is what we can practice. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was also quite pleasantly surprised how the technique of using long, slow breaths worked. I've never done— never consciously done that. Usually I would just leave the breath as it is. And yeah, I was— because at first it felt like, is this some sort of yoga practice? Almost. If you've ever heard of your Ashtanga yoga, where there's the Ujjayi breathing— guess.

**Speaker A:** Where they got it from?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because it does really feel good. That's the thing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it feels good to have long, slow, deep breaths. In fact, it's got several advantages. One advantage is that if we can remember to breathe in long and to remember to breathe out long, every in-breath and every out-breath then is two occasions to practice Sati, which means the skill is going to grow and we're going to be here now much more often because we're here now practicing with the breath. And then there are physiological reasons. One of the physiological reasons is that as we're breathing in long and deep, we're oxygenating the blood better, which means there's going to be better blood flow to the brain, which means we're not going to be so tired. And then on the out-breath, because we're breathing out long, we're going to be cleansing the body. That all of that oxygen that comes in and gets trapped in the lungs and going into the bloodstream, on the out-breath, there's an exchange and a lot of carbon dioxide then will leave the blood and get into the air, and then we breathe that out. Now carbon dioxide, among other things, is when mixed with water, which the body is full of water, is an acid. And the acid is what makes us tired. When alligators are wrestling, they get tired very quickly, because they don't have a good circulation system, so that the oxygen that comes into the muscles and gets used up very fast, and now the muscles are full of carbon dioxide and they can't operate. Well. And so that's also true of the brain, that when we're not breathing well, the blood is full of carbon dioxide and not so much oxygen. So breathing really helps to wake us up as well as making us feel good, vibrantly alive. And then there's, as I said, there's the mind training that helps us to train the mind that while we're breathing in long, it's not just the body that's doing it, it's the mind that's remembering and to applying that. And so it's a mental training in several respects. And so it's really good, this breathing thing. So practicing well, remember, and that the skills will grow quickly.

**Speaker B:** One thing I also noticed with the long, slow breathing was this almost like a habit pattern of the mind to kind of be looking for the next breath rather than focus on the whatever, the inhalation, the exhalation, or the natural pause here and now. And then the sometimes the kind of, it feels to me like the craving in the body where it's like gripping, trying to grip the breath, and how much tension that the body holds. So he showed a lot of different aspects.

**Speaker A:** That's another value, is that when we're breathing well, when we're breathing long, all of the tensions that were in the body become more noticeable. This is actually step 3 of Anapanasati, is begin to see what the body is doing, seeing the tension, seeing the anxiety, seeing the gut disappointments and all of that kind of stuff, seeing the anger that in fact you know that when someone gets anger It's physiological. It's not just mental. They talk about the throat and the neck and the face will get red. Sometimes they get so angry that everything turns red because the blood is so heavy, even into the eyes. And so that's an old saying that Pedro sees red. So, the fists tighten up, the body gets tense when we're ready for fight or flight. But when we're relaxed, we breathe well. Also, there's a state of when we're afraid, we go into a state of freeze. And so, freeze, fight, or flight are the three stages that people spend quite a lot of time in. And when we're breathing well and relaxing, we're not in those three things of freeze, fight, or flight. We're relaxed. We practice that. And then when we start to freeze, fight, or flight, we know it, we can see it, and then we can do something about it. So that we can bring the body back to a state of relaxation, which is both a factor of the first Jhana, and it's also mentioned in the Anapanasati Sutra, that the whole point of learning how to breathe well, breathing in long, breathing out long, is to know the body so we can relax the body. And so all of this stuff works together, and they call it yoga. Have you ever heard of the word pranayana? Yeah. Do you know that pranayana and anapanasati are the same word, just backwards? Prana and Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** One's got an R because it's in Sanskrit. Prajna, Jhana, and Anapanasati, same word. One is out-breath, in-breath, and the other one's in-breath, out-breath. So yeah, we're doing yoga.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, thanks very much for sharing all of this. I'm really feeling the benefit of it.

**Speaker A:** So great, you keep practicing, you'll notice how much better you feel. You'll notice how much life is enjoyable for you. So Eddie, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thanks very much. Enjoy the rest of your day.

**Speaker A:** All right, you too. You enjoy this moment. Cheers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, take care.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: Living in the Dhamma as "Paradise"**
The central teaching is that through correct and consistent practice, one can realize they are already living in a "paradise"—a state of peace and satisfaction found within the Dhamma itself. This shift in perception comes from letting go of wanting and recognizing that "everything is okay."

### **Key Practice Instructions & Insights:**

1.  **Immersion in the Dhamma (Stream Entry):** The goal is to become so immersed in the Buddha's teachings that you see the Dhamma in all situations—both in unwholesome states (as lessons) and in noble practitioners (as inspiration).

2.  **The Importance of Community (Sangha):**
    *   It's easy to fall back into old habits, so regular check-ins with a good teacher, noble friends (*Kalyāṇa-mittatā*), and the Sangha are essential.
    *   The Sangha provides a supportive environment of people who share the mentality of satisfaction, protecting you from the prevailing worldly mindset that promotes dissatisfaction.

3.  **Formal Practice: Cultivating Satisfaction (Sukkha):**
    *   **Method:** Set aside time (e.g., 10 minutes, multiple times a day) to simply "let yourself be okay." The instruction is to practice **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** using **long, slow, deep breaths**.
    *   **Goal State:** The aim is to cultivate the **First Jhāna** factors:
        *   **Freedom from the Five Hindrances** (sensual desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt).
        *   **Applied & Sustained Thought** on the wholesome.
        *   **Joy, Satisfaction (Sukkha), and Relaxation.**
    *   **Duration:** Practice for as long as it feels good. **Do not use a timer**, as that signals a return to "misery." The ideal is to extend this state of satisfaction into all daily activities.

4.  **Breathing Practice (Anapanasati) Benefits:**
    *   **Mental Training:** Each long in-breath and out-breath is an opportunity for mindfulness (*sati*), training the mind to be present.
    *   **Physiological:** Improves oxygenation, cleanses carbon dioxide (reducing fatigue), and increases vitality.
    *   **Revealing Tension:** The practice makes bodily tensions and emotional states (like anger, which manifests as physical tightness) more noticeable, allowing you to relax them. This is directly linked to relaxing the body as taught in the Anapanasati Sutta.

5.  **A Shift in Attitude Towards Learning:**
    *   Having fewer questions is a **positive sign**, indicating the fading of the hindrance of doubt. The Dhamma is to be **enjoyed and experienced**, not just intellectually accumulated.
    *   Endless reading and questioning can be a trap. The core knowledge needed is simple: "just enough knowledge to feel good."

6.  **A Warning About "Business Suit" Buddhism:** The talk cautions against a commercialized, retreat- and book-centric approach to Buddhism in the West. True practice is about integrating the Dhamma into daily life, not buying into it as a product.

### **Dialogue Highlights:**
*   **Speaker B** confirms the effectiveness of the long-breath technique and observes how it reveals mental habit patterns (e.g., craving for the next breath) and bodily tension.
*   **Dhammarato** connects the practice to **yoga** (*prāṇāyāma*), noting the linguistic and practical link between *ānāpānasati* and *prāṇāyāma*.
*   The conversation concludes with an emphasis on **rehearsing feeling good** to counterbalance the time spent in dissatisfaction, leading to a more enjoyable life.

**In essence,** the talk is a practical guide to shifting from a state of wanting and dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) to one of contentment and satisfaction (*sukkha*) through mindful breathing, supportive community, and the simple, repeated practice of allowing oneself to relax and be at peace in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A to illustrate the teachings:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Stream (Stream Entry):**
    *   **Usage:** Used to explain the Buddhist concept of *Sotāpanna* (stream-enterer).
    *   **Meaning:** To become "immersed in the Dhamma." The metaphor suggests entering a current or flow of wholesome understanding and practice that naturally carries one toward liberation.

2.  **Paradise:**
    *   **Usage:** Repeatedly used to describe the present-moment experience of living in alignment with Dhamma.
    *   **Meaning:** The world itself is a paradise when seen through the lens of Dhamma. Suffering arises from not recognizing this because we are caught in wanting and seeking. The practice is to realize "we all live in paradise. Just some of us know it, some of us don't."

3.  **The Business Suit:**
    *   **Usage:** Describes the commercialization of Buddhism in the West.
    *   **Meaning:** Authentic practice has been packaged and sold (through expensive retreats, books, online forums) like a corporate product, losing its core essence of community and direct practice.

4.  **Walking Around Money (First Jhāna):**
    *   **Usage:** Describes the accessible, portable state of well-being from practice.
    *   **Meaning:** The positive mental state (free from hindrances, satisfied, relaxed) is not just for formal sitting but is like a currency you can "walk around with" and use in daily life—talking, working, etc.

5.  **Misery Loves Company:**
    *   **Usage:** Explains why it's hard to maintain a wholesome state around "ordinary people."
    *   **Meaning:** People who are dissatisfied unconsciously try to pull others into their negative mental state to validate their own experience. This highlights the need for a supportive community (Sangha).

6.  **Rehearsal:**
    *   **Usage:** Describes formal meditation practice.
    *   **Meaning:** Setting aside time to practice feeling good is like rehearsing for a performance. It trains the mind to default to a state of satisfaction, counteracting the lifelong "rehearsal" of being unhappy.

7.  **Physiological Metaphors for Breath:**
    *   **Alligator Wrestling:** Used to explain how poor breathing (leading to CO2 buildup/acidity) causes fatigue, just as an alligator's inefficient system tires quickly during struggle.
    *   **Cleansing / Oxygenating:** Long breaths are described as "cleansing the body" of carbon dioxide and "oxygenating the blood," linking mental practice directly to physical well-being and alertness.

8.  **Freeze, Fight, or Flight:**
    *   **Usage:** Describes the states of tension and fear that contrast with the relaxed state of practice.
    *   **Meaning:** These are automatic, stressful physiological responses. The practice of relaxation through breath allows one to recognize and step out of these patterns.

### **Stories / Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Mao Zedong and the Rebuilt Temples:**
    *   **Usage:** To illustrate the resilience and enduring power of the Dhamma and the Sangha.
    *   **Narrative:** Despite a concerted effort (China's Cultural Revolution) to destroy Buddhism, it not only survived but is now growing rapidly. Old temples have been rebuilt, symbolizing the Dhamma's ability to regenerate even after persecution.

2.  **The Implied Story of "Seeking Paradise":**
    *   **Usage:** A cautionary tale about the default human condition.
    *   **Narrative:** Most people spend their lives seeking happiness (paradise) externally through acquisition, argument, or achievement, which leads to misery. The twist is that paradise is already here, found by stopping the seeking.

3.  **The Anecdote of the Enormous Buddhist Library:**
    *   **Usage:** To warn against over-intellectualization and doubt.
    *   **Narrative:** The existence of countless Buddhist books is framed not as a triumph of scholarship, but as evidence of people stuck in doubt and seeking answers from outside, rather than finding the simple, satisfying state of mind through direct practice.

4.  **The Origin Story of Yoga Breathing (Pranayama):**
    *   **Usage:** To connect the specific breathing technique (long, slow breaths) to a broader, ancient tradition and validate its effectiveness.
    *   **Narrative:** Speaker A points out that the Sanskrit *pranayama* and Pali *ānāpānasati* are essentially the same word reversed, implying that the yoga practice of breath control directly originates from this core Buddhist meditation technique. The story of the student noticing it feels like *Ujjayi* breath confirms this cross-traditional link.

These metaphors and stories work together to make abstract Buddhist concepts (**Dhamma**, **Sukha/Dukkha**, **Jhāna**, **Sati**) tangible, relatable, and practical for the listener. They contrast the suffering of ordinary life with the accessible "paradise" of mindful practice, emphasizing community, direct experience, and physiological awareness over intellectual pursuit.
