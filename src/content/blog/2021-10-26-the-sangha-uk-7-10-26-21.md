### Transcript


**Speaker A:** to follow the rules around you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So in defensive driving, when looking at that, it's important to— if there's a car in front of you that you're investigating, always a lot of people will say, oh, he took this turn right here and that's why he got in the car accident. And that's why everything happened, and that's what the insurance looks at or whatever. But really, it might be a little wiser to look at what was he doing beforehand. He was a second behind the person, and he didn't have time to, if the person just rapidly stopped, to stop himself, and that's how the accident happened. And then we look at that a lot of cars tend to drive in clumps, and the people in those clumps are in a lot more danger than the people outside of them. So the point of the analogy being that we like to credit things to one single moment, but a lot of the— you can see a pattern if you're looking, or it's not really that one moment. It's really the events building up.

**Speaker C:** And but that was like Steve Jobs says, you can't see looking forward, but looking back you can see 20/20. Anagami.

**Speaker B:** I agree with what you're saying looking back, but in hindsight— I can express

**Speaker A:** my— because I definitely relate to you too in the sense that I had like in, I don't know, a while back when I was younger, I downloaded an app like Headspace, if you heard of it, which is like short meditations just on your phone, like guided meditations. And then as I did Headspace, like years, years later, I was more interested. Or well, I saw the benefit originally there. And then, you know how everything works in the computer nowadays, you can just click like one single link and find something that you never would have been expecting to find.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's like, so really, I can credit like my whole finding all this meditation stuff a little more, more not intensely, but a little more deeply maybe. Even that word's not very satisfactory, but like one click on like a random Twitch livestream where I found someone that interests me, and then I ended up going down a rabbit hole over a few years just progressively. But yeah, in that sense, there is this one moment that I got sort of curious and lucky, and I clicked on this thing, and I never would have found the other resources I would have found if I hadn't clicked on that thing. And there were other clicks too in that process, but it's interesting to look at how nowadays it can just be a click on a computer rather than having to travel to India like you were mentioning earlier.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I'm getting some background noise from someone.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, that's me. It's like some guy. I don't know what he's doing, but hold on. He's blowing leaves indoors.

**Speaker C:** I didn't know leaves could get in there. That's quite aggressive.

**Speaker E:** It's not like you're blowing leaves right into your room.

**Speaker B:** All right, is that better?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's better. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Yes, that is better. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I live in like an apartment complex, and it's literally right outside my window right there.

**Speaker D:** So, right, right, right. Parker, do you feel done?

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, I feel done. Cool.

**Speaker D:** Who's next?

**Speaker A:** I'll go.

**Speaker E:** I've got to go in just a second, but I can share anyway before I go. Um, so I told a couple of you, I told you that at least that I was involved in Aikido for a number of years. About 15 to 17 years. And one of my best friends in that art introduced me to the wat in Greensboro and Dhammarato to begin with. And so that's how my meditation practice began in earnest. And, you know, all the retreats that followed and then more or less personal practice as it went on. So I guess that was, I mean, I really hadn't known too much about it in a formal manner up until that point, as far as there being instructions involved beyond just a bit of

**Speaker C:** like, you know, Zen I encountered here and there.

**Speaker E:** But once I had been given more, you know, direct instruction in the Vipassana, and then I really enjoyed how that went, how that felt, and then I just kept sort of climbing around in that tradition. So I guess that's the shorthand version of it. And then speaking of clicking on unexpected YouTube links, that's how I rediscovered Dhammarato just a few months ago. And then, and have been re-entering the practice in a bit more serious manner other than, you know, 10 minutes here on a Monday and then 15 minutes on a Wednesday. It's been much more disciplined and dedicated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So, and how much is it, if I can, if I can ask you a personal question and pin you down?

**Speaker A:** What's that?

**Speaker C:** Oh, how much are you meditating now?

**Speaker E:** Um, between, I don't know, between, I don't know, usually 40 minutes on one period and maybe 30 minutes on another. So yeah, somewhere in there, somewhere, somewhere between. And I guess, yeah, I, I've seen an hour to an hour and a half per day in two different times.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** So Ron, when Rick came and joined— oh, and by the way, Ron, I just muted you there because we were still getting— yeah, so yeah, when Rick came and joined these calls for the first time, it was fascinating for me because I had had this whole journey of speaking with Dhammarato, and I think it was the same for Parker, that we've been on this whole journey, and Rick had known Dhammarato sort of 10 years prior to either of us. It's just amazing how it goes. Yeah, so thanks, thanks to Dhammarato for being around for so long.

**Speaker E:** Indeed, indeed.

**Speaker C:** It was, it was a, what a

**Speaker E:** pleasant surprise to see his, uh, his face at just a few months from, from when I saw the first video and said, oh, this guy is still around, let's go reach out. And here I am, you know, today.

**Speaker B:** But I guess, I guess we all have the internet to thank in one way or another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** Unfortunately, guys, I have to sign off. I have a work thing to do, but I'll catch you guys soon.

**Speaker A:** Okay, great, great seeing you, man.

**Speaker B:** Nice meeting you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker D:** Ryan, you want to share how you got started in all this?

**Speaker C:** So my story, as usual, is going to be the weirdest of everybody's.

**Speaker B:** We'll see.

**Speaker C:** So what, so what I was thinking was that I wanted to get into meditation, and anytime I've done meditation, immediately I get into bliss and I get into that peace and the calm. And once I think this is amazing, I have to do this every day. Once I feel I have to do this every day and that pressure is there, I don't do it. So I've had ins and outs with the meditation until I went and got into Transcendental Meditation, and then I got meditation a bit more deeper. I was more regular with it. And so I've been off and on, regular, irregular with the meditation. So how much progress can you make when you're irregular with it? And then finally, then I thought about enlightenment and moving towards this thing, but I didn't really know, okay, how do you do this? And I did this thing. Then I got into Daniel Ingram and Mastering the Core Teachings. And I thought, wow, this is a roadmap.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I thought the same thing. I literally have the book in my living room.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And then I, then, then I, so I read The Mind Illuminated. Then I mean, I started reading that. And I started to get into that practice. Then I thought, okay, then I got into Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation. And then I thought, this is the meditation for me, because Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation is you just feel good, you feel that Metta feeling. And so what they said is that the usual concentrating on the breath the Buddha said, it's too aggressive, too pressured, too clenched fist, because at that time the way you deal with the hindrances is you just push them away and you get back to the breath. It's very forceful. With this one, you have any hindrances that come and you just relax into them. And then you go back and you smile through the meditation. So it's a feel-good meditation. It's smiling and you make journey through the progress much faster. So then I thought, wow, this is even better. It's much faster, much quicker. I love this form of meditation. And then I got shitted. I said, no, man, listen, I don't want to lose my ego now. I love my ego. I love my driving and my searching and my this thing. And my desires and all that. I love— let me do the losing ego and nonsense when in my 60s. But then this part inside you that is actually you, there's no control. No, it just pulls— it's just pulling me back into this process and the practice. And then I'm speaking to— I started speaking to Dan, speaking to you guys, and then once I'm meeting you guys, I'm in the mindset of this thing.

**Speaker D:** Thing.

**Speaker C:** So I'm just thinking, yeah, there's no choice really. You just get pulled into it, no? And it's not me in control, like we all know.

**Speaker B:** No, you don't find the path, the path finds you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. So then I'm like, man, just give up. This is what's happening.

**Speaker D:** Yes. Yeah, wonderful, wonderful. One, one note that I would like to make is about the many interpretations of the Buddha's teaching and how we are subject to many mistranslations, and some might show up with a flavor of forcing. I struggle to imagine that the Buddha himself would ever have recommended any kind of forcing. So we end up with teachers and teachings making statements about the Buddha's teaching. I think it's more often that they're making statements against another interpretation of the Buddha's teaching.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, interpreted later. Yeah, the Buddha's really way was tranquilizing the mind. So that's what they say about relaxing.

**Speaker B:** I mean, the Buddha's way was Vipassana.

**Speaker D:** Well, the most comfortable way that I would say is there are 16 steps in the Anapanasati dance.

**Speaker C:** Are those— is that the progress of insight?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Okay, no, that's the Eightfold Path.

**Speaker D:** I'm not sure that's quite the progress of insight either. I think we might have 3 different menus in play here. But Anapanasati was the actual method, the actual meditation method that the Buddha taught. And there are 16 steps, though as Dhammarato teaches it, what we have to be careful of there with our westernized minds is that we don't think of that as a sequence. Rather they're to be thought of like the steps of a dance that can come in any order. We're rather more freestyling. Tranquilizing the mind is one of those steps, although immediately we're into the problems of translation in that tranquilizing might not quite be the best word for the job. And there's all kinds of little traps like this, all kinds of little semantic puzzles to unravel. Gladdening the mind is Dhammarato's favorite step of Anapanasati. And so that fits right in with the tranquil wisdom insight meditation. And what I found most of all in Dhammarato's presentation of the Dharma is that it's all represented. There's a time for relaxing. There's a time for gladdening. There's a time for tightening up. Now, I don't mean like tensely. I mean like tightening up, as in like tightening up your ship. We were speaking about the Buddhist teaching on right effort either last week or the week before, right? Sometimes the string needs to be tuned a little tighter. Sometimes it needs to be loosened off. And so in teachings like that, we see a clear demonstration of how the Buddha actually had it all represented. And of course, there were 84,000 teachings that eventually went down on paper. It's a heck of a lot of teachings to a heck of a lot of different people. And folks will find ways to criticize the Buddha if they want. Among those 84,000, folks will find places in those 84,000 that can seem to be contradictory. But actually what's happening is a little to the left, a little to the right, one teaching for one dude, another teaching for another dude, all in the direction of Dukkha, Nirodha, the cessation of dissatisfaction. That's what we're interested

**Speaker A:** in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's fair.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. So Ryan, did you feel done? Yeah, that's your whole story. Great. Okay, so the way that I came to this in earnest, Ron, was first of all, I was heinously stressed out. I had I had been living both the benefits and the challenges of a self-employed lifestyle throughout my 20s. I was actually in a lot of physical pain. That was the most prominent complaint that I had. What I would find out in time was that there was mental pain behind that physical pain. I went to see a chiropractor first and foremost, and she said, "There's nothing wrong with your spine." It's what you're doing with it that's the problem. She said, now you can come back and see me every fortnight. I can put you right, and then you can go put yourself wrong, and we'll go on like that for the rest of your life. Or she said, you can go and see an Alexander Technique teacher, and they'll teach you how to stop putting yourself wrong. So that's what I did. I went and saw an Alexander Technique teacher and fell down that rabbit hole. After about 20 weeks of lessons and a week-and-a-half-long summer workshop, one of the things that changed for me immediately was I experienced a diminished tendency to procrastinate. One of the things that I had been procrastinating on was listening to talks by Alan Watts. I had heard some of Alan Watts, and I had the impression that it would be good for me to listen to more. But I had been procrastinating, and so when I stopped procrastinating, that was the first thing I did. I swallowed Alan Watts whole for about 6 months, listened to every talk I could get my hands on. Then I moved on to Ram Dass, and then some other speakers as well. And I started to hear more and more from all of these speakers that at some point some direct guidance from a teacher is a good idea. And I felt ripe for that experience. And so I got on Reddit, started digging around, and I found Dhammarato. Called him up with great skepticism. We spoke for 3 hours. I called him right back the next day and we spoke for another 2 or so. And we would then speak very regularly for around a year as I developed my practice, and then less and less as the practice continued to develop. And the kind of latter part of that story is that at some point there was a crisis in my family. Someone very close to me attempted suicide. And so I stayed with this person and basically threw the Dharma at them, kept speaking with them daily for a period afterward. And happily, they rediscovered the joy in life. And so Dhammarato said, well, you better start teaching some other folks now. And so I started doing that, and The greatest thing about that was how much it reconfirmed and reconfirmed and reconfirmed for me the benefit of the Dharma. It's one thing seeing the practice work for yourself, quite another thing when you're sharing it with others and they're coming back at you and saying, hey, this shit works. And here we are.

**Speaker B:** So you still have your— you still have your body pains?

**Speaker D:** Uh, much, much less. Uh, if I have any of that old physical pain at this point, it's much more on the level of,

**Speaker C:** uh,

**Speaker D:** the words— the word discomfort would even be too much. So that old tendency is still somewhat around, but goodness me, I mean, I've freed myself many times over. With the feeling sense being relative,

**Speaker B:** it

**Speaker D:** becomes difficult to remember how much discomfort one was in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I can understand that. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so yeah, you know, I'll still get the occasional backache, certainly if I go and play a heavy show on the drums, and you know, that's quite something. Then maybe I'll experience a bit of discomfort, but I used to be lying flat on a hard surface for 10 minutes after playing a show just to try to deal with the pain, and I haven't done that for a long time. So very pleased about that. And the Alexander Technique stuff and the Dharma play very well together. I would have all kinds of wonderful conversations with Dhammarato about the Alexander Technique and all kinds of conversations with my Alexander Technique teacher about the Dharma. And sure enough, all we're ever really interested in is Dukkha, Nirodha. We just want to be satisfied, and that's what both the Buddha and this fella Alexander were interested in, in their own ways. So I've had quite a good few years, I would say. I feel very fortunate to have come into contact with these wonderful teachers, wonderful friends. How about you, Ron? What's your story?

**Speaker B:** Oh, uh, not really similar to any of the other stories that I've heard so far. For me, it was honestly psychedelics, right?

**Speaker D:** We've spoken a little about this, haven't we?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So at first, I just, you know, I was having these insane intense experiences with LSD. It kind of opened up my perspective for what was possible. I was experiencing the world in ways I'd never thought possible before. But the thing is, I could always sense this kind of like the ceiling, you know. There was something, there was more there to be experienced than what I was currently getting at. And then I had this experience after that kind of reaffirmed that belief I actually went to this LSD retreat with my mom, actually.

**Speaker D:** Oh, wow. Don't hear that often.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Because it was run by my mom's sister. She's a psychiatrist and she dabbles in that type of stuff. Cool.

**Speaker C:** Right. She was a psychiatrist.

**Speaker B:** Oh, wow. That's cool.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No. So I thought that I was having the craziest experiences on this stuff, you know? And then I sat down and my aunt's husband did the process too. And, you know, after, you know, we laid down, we let the trip take its course. After, we set up a campfire and I heard my aunt and uncle talking, and my aunt was like, oh, so which type of experience did you have this time? Did you have more of a visual one or an auditory one? He was like, oh no, I had a traveling one. I was like, wait a second, what do you mean by that? And, you know, at that point they kind of hinted into me that it's not really about the dosage, it's about what you're willing to receive from it. You know, after that, uh, shortly after that, I moved out, I started my first year in college, and, you know, me and my roommate kind of went on an LSD bender. So to speak. But I'd like to think that it was very beneficial because at the end of the day, I feel like a lot of people, they tend to have bad experiences because they do it for the wrong reason, you know. They treat it like a drug. They just try to escape reality. And I was using it to try to dive deeper into my own psyche, to hit that ceiling that I could always sense. And then, you know, one of the times I eventually, I reached that ceiling and I shattered it, and I had had my, my first out-of-body experience, for, for lack of better words. And that experience just gave me undeniable proof that there was something greater than myself, than the simple experience of this body. It kind of gave me like a glimpse into Nirvana. And that was what kind of inspired me to learn more about meditation and this and that, because suddenly I knew there was more there than I was currently aware of. And my journey started with Frank Yang. I know I've told you about him before. You know how you said you were listening to all this Alan Watts over the past 6— over a course of 6 months? I was the same way with Frank Yang.

**Speaker D:** Great. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know, that got me into Daniel Ingram as well. I started, uh, I started reading, uh, books by Shinzen Young, and I have two by, uh, Ajahn Bhikkhu that I still haven't read yet. And, you know, it's just all that combined with my practice because, you know, once I really started getting into it, it just— I had this like moment of clarity where it just felt as if it was something that was always supposed to happen. Because, you know, I would have these insights and these memories from my childhood that kind of pointed back to that, and I just couldn't tell then.

**Speaker D:** Couldn't tell what?

**Speaker B:** That that's what it was pointing to. You know, I would have like memories when I was a little kid, or, you know, back in high school when I was just like Why don't I have the answers? What's wrong? And, you know, looking back, I see exactly why it happened as it happened and how it led me to where I am today. You know, once I started getting deeper into it, I just, I just want nothing more except to see clearly. I feel like it's just a matter of returning to what it is that you always were.

**Speaker D:** Indeed, indeed, the irreducible truth.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. And I already have a nihilistic perspective on life. I don't think there's any meaning, any purpose, anything, you know. I know at the end of the day you're just born, you live, and then you die. And, you know, I'm already past the point of no return. I can never go back to trying to be and live as I was before. So there's only one direction for me to go with this, right?

**Speaker D:** Right. And if experience tells me anything, it's that interestingly, you're highly likely to find yourself living a life which other people will point at and say is full of meaning Yeah, as you wander around experiencing emptiness everywhere.

**Speaker B:** I don't even know about that though, because, you know, we can't know for sure.

**Speaker D:** We can't know for sure.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, but, you know, I used to, you know, I used to think that I knew exactly what I wanted out of life. You know, I used to love the idea of getting married, having a family, you know, starting a business, you you know, taking advantage of the capitalist society that we live in. And now I don't even know if I want all that. I don't know if I even want a life that in the eyes of someone normal would be considered fulfilling, because at the end of the day, it wouldn't be regardless. It wouldn't make a difference.

**Speaker D:** Well, it can't bring you satisfaction. And one of the qualities of that point of no return that you're speaking about is that you see, as our friend Dhammarato likes to express it, oh, boundless joy to find at last there is no happiness in the world. Yeah, we stop looking at things for our happiness, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But then another thing, I used to want to be a father. Very much now. I don't think I want to have kids. I feel like the desire to want to have children is inherently selfish because for the most part, you're not doing it for them. You're doing it for your own desire to have a child at the end of the day, to live, to suffer.

**Speaker D:** You can't ask them ahead of time

**Speaker C:** whether or not they want to be.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. They're incapable of making the choice. And you know, this is something I've asked myself. Over and over, very, very many times. If I could have chosen to never have existed in the first place, would I do it or would I not? Because right now, all I'm even trying to do is get back to that, that vast space of emptiness.

**Speaker D:** An unborn child has no opportunity for realization either.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's fair, right?

**Speaker D:** So there's something to be said for all of that, what should we say, reverence with which the wisdom traditions treat the human birth. And largely what I see is precisely that when one is wandering in Samsara One might have a kind of resentment toward birth, but then from the place of realization, nothing but gratitude for the marvelous wonder of a single moment. And it's quite a trip. To bring it full circle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wish I could say I knew what it was like,

**Speaker D:** but well, that's— well, you do.

**Speaker B:** Well, I do, but I don't. I feel like I definitely do have the intellectual understanding, and I definitely have had defining experiences that have given me great joy, gratitude, appreciation simply for being in the present moment. But I feel like I've yet to achieve these insights of direct realization into my own true nature. You know, I've read somewhere that on the path there are 5 levels of realization. The first is association with the ego, which is just what every normal person is. The second is association with consciousness or awareness. Which could be seen as, you know, where you are after stream entry. The third level is association with infinity, God, love, everything. The fourth level is association with nothing, death, you know, stuff like that, emptiness. And then the fifth level is true nature or Buddhahood, where all the previous steps merge together and transcend themselves.

**Speaker D:** And it's just this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And this is good enough as it is.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm just on Skype call.

**Speaker C:** Oh, am I dripping?

**Speaker B:** No, it's okay. I was just gonna say that I'm

**Speaker A:** playing,

**Speaker B:** um, oh, the times. Oh shit, right now? Yeah. Oh shit, yeah, I might have to hop in that. So I got the last earnings, they're similar, and like, I just think revenue is going to match or exceed expectations.

**Speaker C:** So I think those options here— okay,

**Speaker B:** sorry about that, guys.

**Speaker D:** No problem, no problem. A knock at the door right at the punchline. Yeah, which was— not sure whether you heard that in the end it's just this and this is good enough as it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker D:** That's it. That's the whole show. And yes, there is the apparent moving through stages, and so people publish these wonderful maps that bring us right back to where we started, right here, right now. The difference being Now it's finally good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** It's just— Bhikkhu Buddhadasa

**Speaker A:** had the idea. That's Dhammarato's teacher. Of little nirvanas.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Oftentimes, especially now in the West, nirvana is this very grandiose thing that we think it's kind of really a concept rather than something that we've really experienced. It's just something we've learned through hearsay. But originally, one of the definitions of the word nirvana is cooling off. So something as simple as pizza coming out of the oven. That's in Nirvana, it's cooling off. And we have these moments every day, even say after a long day of work, watching the TV, right? That's a little bit of cooling off after a day of— you're getting— although the TV might not be giving you what you want exactly, you're giving yourself to the TV and kind of enjoying the present moment. So we have these experiences of Nirvana every day. They're an everyday thing. And like I've said, it's just about enjoying them and settling into them. And they're right here.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we can't get away from it. If truth is truth, there's absolutely nothing we can do to get away from it. Even our most deluded wanderings in Samsara are right here, right now. But it's the seeing, right? Seeing the appreciation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's literally all it is, just seeing it as is.

**Speaker D:** Seeing it as is. And you mentioned that most wholesome of desires earlier on, which is that desire to see things clearly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know. I feel like that's one of my biggest obstacles, the idea that it's something that isn't here right now, right? It's just because when I meditate, I try— I meditate at least for half an hour every day, you know, half an hour of do-nothing meditation in the morning. I let my desires, thoughts, emotions, everything just arise and pass as it is. I stop associating with them. The only thing I try to actively look for are impermanence and no-self. And when I do my meditation practices, I realize like I'm there. This isn't me meditating. Meditation is just consciousness expressing itself. But then throughout the rest of the day, I still feel solidified for the most part.

**Speaker D:** There are two different roads that I'd enjoy going down here. Let's see if I can keep track of them, keep track of the other while I talk about the one. I'll do the quickest one first, and one is a potent antidote to our negative bias that we're trained into with our westernized minds is to acknowledge the successes that we're having in meditation.

**Speaker B:** I've been told I need to do that.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, yeah, by my roommate. Okay, well, good advice, and it sounds like it would be something— to some, it sounds like it would be something altogether too deliberate, certainly if the instruction is to do nothing, until we appreciate that actually we're likely in negative bias already. Right now, we don't want to kind of take that at face value and say, I'm in negative bias, so I need to do something else to— but it's just acknowledging the successes that we're having in meditation is something that we're not predisposed to do. We're more predisposed, due to our conditioning, our upbringing, to spot our short— yeah, yeah, yeah. So when you sit with the intention to see, and you see that's a success, right? Yeah, yeah. And that has the power of making the sit pleasant, enjoyable. So what do you know, now we want to sit more.

**Speaker B:** And so that definitely has been— that definitely has been happening lately. I've, I've seen my ability to be able to sit is definitely coming much more naturally, right? And I definitely want to start meditating in the afternoons too and incorporating Vipassana meditation into my routine as well, because I feel like at the end of the day they're just two sides of the same coin, you know. The Vipassana meditation kind of deconstructs the solidity within the body-mind makes it easier to see clearly while doing do-nothing meditation?

**Speaker D:** Well, it's all an investigation in the end, right? And so you'll try whatever methods you want to try, and if they bring you what you're seeking, which is Dukkha, Nirodha, then you'll know to continue. You'll know that that's the right direction. Now the other road that I wanted to go down was the road of skill development, which Dhammarato is really keen on. So we talk about skill, meaning as you sit and you look and you investigate, you're developing the skills of looking and investigating. As you develop skills, they become easier to deploy. And so where once you had to have that distraction-free environment in order to deploy those skills, now you can do it while you're out at a concert. Now you can do it when the dentist is shoving a drill down your throat, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And the easier those skills become, the more we develop those skills in sitting the easier it is to bring them into everything. And that's really where we want to be. That's the sweet spot, is where we don't have to do much of anything that looks formal. We've developed the skills so that they require very little input, so to speak. We're still alert, we're still watching, but it's easy to be alert, it's easy to watch.

**Speaker B:** You just don't feel any attachment to the action, right?

**Speaker D:** Right. Indeed, when Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is seen clearly, why would you not go in the direction of Dukkha, Nirodha? Why would you ever choose Sukkha, right? So there's a kind of momentum.

**Speaker C:** Why not? Why not? Dukkha is amazing.

**Speaker D:** Tell me more, Ryan.

**Speaker C:** Sukkha is suffering, is beautiful, it's spectacularly

**Speaker D:** beautiful in a way of seeing things. Sure.

**Speaker C:** No, no, I mean, you put your— you did your drumming. How much suffering did you get to do the drumming? How many manas did you put in? Anything I've gotten good at, I've gotten good at gym, I put the manas into it. I got good at game, I put the manas into it. I felt the pain. I— everything, my work, I put the pain and I put the manas in.

**Speaker D:** Sure.

**Speaker C:** So it's suffering is beautiful. See the good things that happen to me, I can feel good. I can feel like a fucking champion now. Look at me now, I'm pumping my mood up. Let me show you how I pump my mood up. Look at my mood now. Here it goes, here it goes. Yes, there I can get that. Yeah, and you know, it's— I'm really playing because it's infectious. Okay, I can feel good at any time. Okay, now feeling good— see, all the things that in life that feel good, they feel crap afterwards. Like the food.

**Speaker D:** Oh, well, okay, okay. So now we're talking about things. Okay, now we're talking about the world. When we talk about Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, we're talking about the supramundane Dharma beyond the world.

**Speaker C:** But then at which point does it stop becoming beyond the world? Because I've got suffering, and suffering really guides me to what to sort out in my life, what to address in my life.

**Speaker D:** Oh, indeed, indeed. And the Buddha included first of all in the Four Noble Truths the truth of Dukkha. So yes, in a sense we can say that we owe Dukkha a great debt. Thank you, Dukkha, for bringing us to the second, third, and fourth noble truths.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but I'm on the other hand in which that suffering, they say, is the— see, I'm anti-Buddha in a lot of ways, okay?

**Speaker A:** Because

**Speaker C:** see, at the end of the day, I feel the Buddha was right, okay? But at this point in time, like I was speaking to Muhammad, I need to have two opposite views in my mind. I need to question everything. So what did the Buddha do? The Buddha had his wife, he had his children, he left them in the lodge, he went out there, he didn't like suffering, he couldn't even handle seeing a sick lady or a dead person, he went into the jungle, then he couldn't deal with that, went to one teacher, said, okay man, what can I do? I'm still suffering, went to teacher after teacher, then he said, man, I don't even like this life, I don't even like lifetimes, I just want out. So he just put the work in to get out of everything, okay. And here we are enjoying every magical moment saying, no, I want to keep. And I feel sad. For example, me putting the work in, and if I reach whatever the progress of inside the goals, I'm cheating all those other lives from happening. Those are the beautiful past life, future lives that I could be happening. No, suddenly if I'm out of the cycle of birth and rebirth, there's so much joy that's happening, so much enjoyment. That life that I leave, after I leave the cycle of birth and death. Right now I'm in the cycle of birth and death for an instant, but after that there's bliss, there's magic, there's joy, but that's for eternity. Let me have this little time on this earth. Oh, you, you, hey, hey, and this is me, this is me who's been flogged. I've been flogged, I put in a cage with— oh my God, this is when you step in.

**Speaker F:** Yes. Hi guys, nice to see you. Hi Parker. Hi Ryan. And who is this?

**Speaker D:** This is Ron.

**Speaker F:** Hi Ron.

**Speaker D:** This is my wife.

**Speaker F:** I just pop in occasionally and disrupt the call. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, you were saying something very interesting, Ryan. Go on.

**Speaker C:** No, but I love the suffering. I mean, suffering is amazing. It's just that Suffering gives me desire, suffering makes me move, and this thing. And I feel that even the desire is good. Maybe I can have the desire that comes from an open fist, but the desire really gives me like, I want to eat clean, I want to meditate. There's desire, and the Buddha had desire. The Buddha wanted to run away from everything, do the meditation, move from topic to topic, and there's not any saint.

**Speaker D:** So there's Indeed, yeah, and you can play with the toy of Dukkha for as long as you like.

**Speaker F:** I think there's, first of all, what you said reminds me of Jordan Peterson. He sometimes says that it can be effective to put your suffering before you, right? Where you're scared of your suffering and you're using that as a fuel to do better. Right? I feel like that's what you're doing, kind of. But there may be some confusion around the words pain and suffering.

**Speaker D:** Always.

**Speaker B:** I was about to ask the same thing.

**Speaker F:** Right? Pain is something inevitable. It's like a consequence of an action. But suffering, we can— Optional. Yeah, it's optional. Often created by us. So suffering would be when a patient has a diagnosis of, say, XYZ, and then because they have had that diagnosis, now they are creating suffering on top of it. You know, a patient who has had diagnosis of a terminal illness, instead of enjoying his or her last few moments on the earth, are going to be depressed. Depressed because they have that diagnosis, or they may feel that they're going to be a burden on their family, which is kind of fabrication, which is unnecessary, which is created on top. I think that's what the Buddha was talking about.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, which is why I'm keen on that alternate translation of the word Dukkha, dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or let's say even like something not as extreme. Let's say you stub your toe on your bed frame, you know. Yeah, so basically what happens to you is you get an experience in the form of a sensation and a story. Now the suffering comes when you don't realize the differentiation between the two of these, and you associate the story that the mind makes with the sensation that's simply there.

**Speaker F:** Or we could go far enough to say when you cling to the pain. Like you gave the example of stubbing your toe, right? If somebody interprets that as, "Oh my God, I'm having a terrible day because I stubbed my toe," that's like going beyond what is immediate. You're dragging it on to the future. You're kind of clinging to the pain.

**Speaker B:** You attach yourself to your interpretations of what the sensation is.

**Speaker F:** I think that's what the Buddha was talking about. Yes, Ryan, you were going to say something.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so in case I stub my toe, I have a voice that enters my head and it says 5 seconds. That's it, I only have to take it for 5 seconds, it's gone in 5 seconds.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, brilliant.

**Speaker C:** And so I feel about pain, yeah, pain is mandatory, suffering is optional. But suffering, if there was— we are humans and we love suffering, we love drama, we create it, we seek it in our lives. And if there was— Until

**Speaker D:** we don't.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, if there was a movie in our heads, sorry, that was goodness from start to finish, only good things from start to finish, it would be a box office failure.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Oh, indeed.

**Speaker F:** Well, I, I don't think we love suffering, but I would say we need it to feel the contrast, to enjoy the happiness as much as we do.

**Speaker B:** Like you said, you need the highs for the lows.

**Speaker C:** You must be loving so much to bloody chase it so much.

**Speaker D:** Sorry, what was that?

**Speaker C:** I was saying, Ryan, you must be loving suffering to bloody chase it so much.

**Speaker D:** Well, it's the kind of, uh, it's kind of a dysfunctional relationship.

**Speaker F:** Are you saying that to a psychiatrist? Ouch.

**Speaker D:** With the contrast thing, that works when it's happy and sad in the worldly sense.

**Speaker B:** In the dualistic mindset.

**Speaker D:** Yes, we're not after the same kind of happiness in the practice. We're after the happiness that remains in

**Speaker B:** the absence of all else, the unconditional happiness.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that is our natural state, that is our default condition when we get everything else out the way.

**Speaker F:** We can look at it and be

**Speaker A:** like, the Buddha has the teaching of— oh, go ahead. He's done. The Buddha has the teaching of gratification, danger, and escape. So when we're going through and how you talk about, or Danny talks about, everything has highs and lows. You need the opposite to have the— or you need bad to have the good, right? You don't though, and that's the Buddhist teaching of gratification, danger, and escape, is that many people before they are wise, or people who are not wise, they go through chasing the gratification unaware of the danger. They chase the highs unaware that there are lows, even though they've probably experienced them before. They're misleading themselves to think those highs are the end, where they're not. So it's about just investigating the highs that we find and see if we can find them where they're a little less dangerous. And once we have a high that's less dangerous, we can escape the high that was a little more dangerous.

**Speaker C:** But what if we go for the most dangerous highs?

**Speaker A:** Well, why would you want to do that?

**Speaker C:** But we are going for the most dangerous size.

**Speaker B:** I feel like that's human nature, honestly.

**Speaker C:** And we're destroying ourselves. I mean, that is destruction of the self. That's a high.

**Speaker A:** I think you're misunderstanding the dangerous in the sense there is adrenaline when you're doing something dangerous. I mean, My dad's been watching shows on surfing where the surfers are now surfing waves as big as a building, or if it collapsed on them, I wouldn't want to see that video. But there's an adrenaline that people seek, but not everyone does that because they know the dangers. We still have this cost-benefit analysis, right?

**Speaker C:** But then on the other hand, some people do rock climbing, like they do free soloing. I don't think we mean that the person at that time is more alive than he's ever been in his life.

**Speaker B:** No, it's because that surge of adrenaline forces you to be present.

**Speaker D:** He might interpret that cocktail of sensation as I'm more alive than I've ever been.

**Speaker A:** And tell me why we have 7 billion people and only one person did that to get their happiness.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think it's not a matter of being more alive. I think it's, I think it's simply a matter of being more present. You know, when, like, let's say you're doing something dangerous like that, you put yourself in a life or death situation, like surfing on a huge wave, or for example, going twice the speed limit on the highway, you're forced to be present. Because if you let your attention escape for even a split second, that could be the difference between life and death.

**Speaker A:** That's a really good point.

**Speaker C:** Yes, when he's climbing over there, he has to be in Zen. He has to be completely aware.

**Speaker D:** And so the question becomes, can we experience that presence without these extreme phenomena, these extreme circumstances?

**Speaker F:** Again, the story of ditching the raft comes to mind. Raft? Raft? How do you say that?

**Speaker D:** Different analogy.

**Speaker F:** No, a person may use that to be present in the moment.

**Speaker D:** Okay, yeah, if they were doing it as a deliberate practice, right? If someone was saying,

**Speaker B:** um, yeah, but that's hardly ever the case. People do it because they're thirsting for that presence and they have no other

**Speaker A:** way of getting it. Growing up being taught like things, you need to learn your ABCs to be happy and then we'll be proud of you. You need to get a job and then we'll appreciate you. So we go through life living by the same mindset. We need to do this thing to get that. And then so the rock climber thinks he needs to be in that rock climbing mode to be satisfied, to be in the moment. But you don't, right? There's enough to look at right now. I mean, you have your own personal body, your own toy, and you can play with that. You can investigate that. You don't need to be be on a mountain to do some investigation.

**Speaker F:** I would argue that those people who take on those challenges are probably practicing mindfulness of some sort, minus the insight. Does that make sense?

**Speaker A:** They're experiencing it, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think they're practicing it, but they're not consciously aware that that's what they're doing.

**Speaker F:** But without insight into the Jhana. So that's the best way for them to practice, right? But obviously there's a more easier, more wholesome way to sustain and a more sustainable way to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Now to pick up a thread that was going earlier, Ryan, you mentioned the hardships of something like learning to play the drums. Well, what I can tell you about my experience with that is it was a mixed bag. Some of the moments felt hard, some of the moments felt delightfully easy. When I speak with people about my experience of learning to play the drums as a teenager, honestly, it was often as though it was happening to me. It was, for the most part, a very easy process, and certainly having seen hundreds of drum students since, I can tell you I was the anomaly. The kid who just wanted to be all the time. So a lot of the moments were actually very pleasant. I've experienced all kinds of euphoria in playing music. What I became interested in is the question, well, okay, can we do away with the nasty bits? Can I teach someone to play music with just the nice bits? And I'm having tremendous success. And we've been speaking about this pretty much, haven't we, Ryan?

**Speaker C:** I feel there's one major source of distress and pain in my life, okay, which is not being able to do the things I want to most do.

**Speaker D:** Are you sure that you want to do them, or could it be that you want to want to do them?

**Speaker C:** No, but these things are important, like getting a family.

**Speaker D:** Says who?

**Speaker C:** Says the selfish Anicca.

**Speaker B:** There's no blueprint for what it means to be human. That's something I've come to understand. All these things that you might want to do are just ideas that were put in your head that you believe you need in order to have a fulfilling life. When at the end of the day, I believe it's a fulfillment within itself is nothing more than an illusion.

**Speaker C:** But the thing is, Ron, you've signed out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right.

**Speaker C:** I haven't signed out. I haven't signed out.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's the paper that you're signing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so let me, so let me ask you this. I know this is kind of a dark turn, but what if you die tomorrow?

**Speaker C:** What if I die right now? I'd die beautifully happy.

**Speaker F:** All right, so I don't want anything.

**Speaker A:** So you don't need a family to be happy?

**Speaker C:** No, but then I'd be in my life, and when this Ryan who's living in the afterlife, in these afterlife worlds, in conceptual realities— oh wow, wow, wow,

**Speaker B:** that's based off the belief that there is an afterlife and afterworld. You know, if I'm sharing my own personal belief, I think from a subjective physical standpoint, I personally, I don't believe in the soul. I think once you die, that's it. Your brain stops fabricating reality and there is no more Ron or Ryan or Parker or Dan Goldfield anymore.

**Speaker C:** So I have a completely different view on that. Okay, and, and I'm also holding two things. I'm holding the thing that Ron, that you're absolutely right. Come on, man, what is this? We come and we leave, there's nothing. What is this? I'm going to go and into different past lives and future lives and all that. Come on, Ryan, you're full of shit. At the other time, I'm like, no, there's a soul. The soul is driving this thing. So, so I just formulate where I come to is the one thing in life that gives me the most pain is not being able to do the things I most want to do, which is like, come on, Ryan, go out, get a girlfriend, get the house.

**Speaker A:** Can I express this in another way, or maybe give a bigger picture to how I experienced it in my life? In that there were things certainly that I did want a lot, and I can look back at them now and still see some gratification in them. Say There was a dream of being a professional athlete because that was a dream people around me had, and like say parents and such, and they had the same dream for themselves and it wasn't quite fulfilled. So it was kind of my dream to complete for them in a sense. So it's— As a kid, when you're young, you ignorantly adopt that as your own, right? Because oftentimes your actions, when you do something that's not aligned with that dream, those around you, they are dissatisfied with that, right? They don't like that you were disaligned with that. So you continue and you kind of build a model in your head like, "I'm going to do this because it makes me happy," because it does make you happy. If everyone around you is mad at you, you're not happy, right? So you continue with that. And you follow that and you're like, this is the way I'm going to be happy, is becoming this professional athlete, this dream that I have. And the same can be said with a career, going to college and such, a career in music.

**Speaker C:** I'm not doing these things to make me happy. I'm doing these things because they have to be done.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. I have to become a professional athlete. I have to get a job. I have to go to college.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So the way I see this thing is that I need to provide for future Ryan. And the thing is, past Ryans have wanted a family. Future Ryans will want a family. But this Ryan has to do the hard work of going and meeting people and possibly getting rejected and getting this thing and saying no and yes. And the ups and downs of the dating game and all that. I have to do this.

**Speaker A:** So I think one thing to— I understand what you— I want to point out one thing. Have you— you've heard the idea of destiny, right?

**Speaker B:** I think it's better phrased determinism.

**Speaker A:** Well, I think oftentimes the word destiny, we say we have this destiny. I think that can be understood as we've done these habits in the past. And when in the past we haven't changed these habits, consistent actions have happened. We have these habits that build up. So we make the ignorant assumption or false assumption that I'm going to continue doing these habits and the same thing is going to happen in the future. But you don't know that.

**Speaker C:** So see where I'll tell you where I'm going with these things, okay? Is yeah, you're right. So that's what I'm thinking is about— that's where I'm going is about destiny. And so anyway, so I'll just move quickly. I'll just say it one sentence at a time to make it easier on you guys. So I've had these things, the things I was most upset about with myself or frustrated with that gives me most pain is why can't you do the simplest things? Why can't you be consistent? And I have a daily meditation practice. Why can't you be consistent? And I have a daily harmonica practice. Why can't you be consistent and sort your sleep out? These are simple things that we'd like for you. Why can't you exercise every day? Simple things. Meditate for 20 minutes, exercise for 10 minutes, that's it. Happy. But you're still not doing that every day. What the fuck? Why can't you do these simplest things? And then I find, after speaking to Dan, maybe the reason I'm not doing these things is there's too much attachment attached to it. There's too much wanting in this thing. And also in terms of relationships and women, what's the worst thing in terms of you can get a woman. Which is the one absolute thing you should not need is being needy, okay? And then wanting something and filling this hole, okay? So then, then I'm thinking, okay, fine, let's say maybe I should really let go of these things and remove the charge. And this is the thing, then I finally get to Wu Wei, which is just completely let go. And then when I completely let go, things just happen. I'm reading the right books, I'm doing the right work. And then just things just automatically flow. And when this— and then I realized, Ryan, so then I was on a WhatsApp group of people doing personal development, and I told them about discipline. They were talking about discipline, and I said there's no such thing as discipline, because how many things have you guys used discipline for to get, and how has it worked out for for you. Okay, discipline doesn't really work. So the things that we've gotten good at, we don't need the discipline for. And so that's what you're trying to do, Dan, with your patient. You're saying that the students who need the discipline actually won't be taking the drums into the future, while the others feel that there's this thing taking over me. So the things that I've done well in my life, I've just taken over and I've just had to flow into it. So then I thought, try and see. So with all these things, if I'm speaking to a girl, what am I supposed to do to really get along with her? Is I need to put Ryan on the side and let my divinity and her divinity connect. Something like that. And then be in the present moment. That's it. What do I do with life and these things that I want to do? Again, put Ryan and his wants and needs on the side. Let the divinity inside me just get through. So with all these things, I'm realizing across the board, the thing is about self-transcendence, is that, Ryan, shut the fuck up, sit on the side. Everything will happen on its own. I am Shiva. I am running the show now. Yeah, that's better than your wildest dreams. And here you go, you just sit back and relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's actually the concept behind— oh, I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say, you know, like before you were saying how, you know, I've signed off and you have decided that you don't want to yet, but that's kind of the concept behind the whole path, you know. It's just you let reality happen on its own. Everything is still happening, there's just no doer in here slowing down the process. It just It does itself.

**Speaker C:** Exactly.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** And one way that we could express that would be the difference between wanting, i.e., something that occurs naturally, genuine wanting, and wanting to want, which is altogether more of this— shoulds, oughts, and musts, things will be better if, things will be better when, right? My experience with the question, what do I want, was at some point in my Alexander Technique training. We were doing a lot of personal development material, and that question is foremost in the personal development material, right? What do you want? Otherwise expressed as find your why, right? And I agonized over that question for a good year. Spent about a year agonizing over that question, which doesn't sound like long in conversation, but it felt like long at the time. And what changed was when I stopped trying to answer that question in the abstract as an essay question— what do I want, dot, dot, dot— and started looking at what I'd been doing for the past hour, day, week, month, year, decade as evidence of what I actually want. Because if a desire is genuine Unless you're in such a mess that you're just acting entirely on shoulds, oughts, and musts, you would hope that your behavior will tell you something about what you want. And that's precisely what happened. And so what I realized was that I hadn't been counting understanding myself, seeing things clearly, studying the Dharma, sharing time with Dharma friends, listening to talks, reading books. I hadn't been counting that as a valid want because I thought a want had to look like a career, a family, all the things that I had been told that I should want, all of the things that I deemed acceptable to want, all of the things I wanted to want, the Dharma wasn't one of them. That wasn't on the list. No one had ever spoken to me about the Dhamma in my youth.

**Speaker C:** So then, then, Dan, the problem is that what I want is I want drama. I want a big fat burger.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I would love a big fat burger right now.

**Speaker C:** And then I find actually that what I need to be putting myself through is I need emotional discomfort. I need to put myself in dangerous situations where the ego is under attack. Not dangerous situations where I'm standing in front of traffic, but where my sense of self can change.

**Speaker F:** And so, yeah, I mean— Could you give an example?

**Speaker C:** Now, for example, if Dan's doing drumming, then suddenly Dan is now a teacher. So to step up, become a teacher, his sense of self changes.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** When you enter a relationship and you're getting married, suddenly your sense of self changes. You're like, oh, okay, man, this is what I— it's like, it can be a different thing. It's different. And the ego wants to hold on to what is. The sense of self changing. If suppose the things I want to do, if I succeed in meditation, forget about my sense of self changing. There is just no self at all. If I want to get whatever, to exercise or whatever, there's again the old self is broken down and the new self is built up. So with all these things, that sense of past self goes to be built up by something new. And then there's also this, there's that egoic homeostasis. Where it wants to hold on to the old person. I want to write books and then there's a change, there's a fear. And I think all fears underlying has the same thing, that loss of self.

**Speaker F:** But interestingly, self is itself a very elusive concept because what we think is self is not your real self. So when you think of Ryan, you construct an image with experiences that speak to you the most, that have struck to your memory, stuck to your memory for some reason. So basically, your version of Ryan is a fabrication. So if you think it that way, there is no Ryan in reality. So what you're saying, that your sense of self changes, I agree with it, but it's more like a role that you're playing.

**Speaker C:** If you take that— whatever you're seeing, you're seeing role that I'm playing. Yeah, I've done a lot of personal development work across the board, across several fields. Yeah, I meet anybody whom I met when I was 13, they say, Ryan, you changed at all.

**Speaker F:** That's their interpretation. They're choosing to focus on the parts of you that haven't changed.

**Speaker C:** No, but, but, but that's what they will say. Come on, I mean Your friends also know who meet you from 12 and 15, they'll tell you, man, you haven't changed in a nice way.

**Speaker B:** And that would just reaffirm the belief of the self.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** You see, what is happening is this is all malleable. This is the present moment. That's all there is. I'm creating a past narrative. I'm creating a future narrative. And based on my narrative, my life is just going. If I do a piece of work to change a certain self-belief, my life changes after that. So maybe all it is is just that I just have to keep changing these beliefs and these stories about myself.

**Speaker D:** No, you have to ditch them altogether.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have to transcend them.

**Speaker D:** So belief is another mental construct, and we're better off without it.

**Speaker B:** Belief is basically doubt.

**Speaker C:** What is happening is, no matter what it is, there are some stories that I'm telling myself about myself.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Which is like, Ryan, you're not consistent.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Or Ryan, you're, you're like this, or whatever. Or— and, uh, so those stories, who's to say that they're true or not true? They're definitely not true. I can change them. But at the end of the day, it's what's— so maybe the point I am really trying to say is that I'm really working with you guys, which is I'm just trying to surrender and just let go and let Shiva come through me. But sometimes at night I find Shiva moving my hands and doing a piece of belief work for me.

**Speaker B:** So I have a question for you, Ryan. So when you have a thought, a thought of yourself coming up in your head, do you think that you are that thought, that you are the voice that's speaking?

**Speaker C:** See, on an intellectual level, I don't think so. Okay, see, I feel that this is all false. Okay, and I probably have done a lot more talks than you have also. So this is the thing. That's across the board.

**Speaker D:** If you start counting now, guys, we'll catch up with you this time next week.

**Speaker C:** So I feel that No, that— see, I heard somebody say, find someone who's enlightened and see how many times they use the word I.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, yes and no.

**Speaker B:** It's just such a common word. It's almost impossible to say it. Yeah, there are a lot of things

**Speaker A:** that don't make sense if you don't

**Speaker F:** use— That's holding yourself to a very unreasonable standard. You can't function. Without using the word I. But I get what you're trying to say.

**Speaker C:** Funny, that thing. So yeah, if you're asking me, I can tell you answers on two levels, which is the answer that you're looking for, which is, yep, this is me and this is Ryan. Ryan is talking to you, Ryan is speaking to you, Ryan has this backstory, Ryan has his future story, he's got these themes, and this is all Ryan is. Okay. Then after that, there's the next level, which is there is no Arahant, there is no self. This is just an imagination. There's not even an Arahant. The craving is the Arahant. That's all Arahant is, is the craving and the searching and this thing. And so where I am right now is just let go, surrender, leave the clenched fist and be in the open fist and see what happens and just give up to Shiva.

**Speaker D:** Giving you— Okay, so, so where is then all of this? You— we kind of went down this road, Ryan, on this idea that you said this is like your main problem right now, is that you find that you're not able to do the things that you really want to do.

**Speaker C:** So, but no, once I suddenly give up, I'm able to do all these things easily.

**Speaker D:** Perfect. Yeah, bingo.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's the thing. And so that, that's when I read— that's what I told those personal development guys, we need to move beyond discipline.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, discipline is like bullying yourself.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, but where the belief systems change— no, see, for example, if I was sexually abused in childhood, or let's say somebody was sexually abused when they were child, they'll put on weight, and for them, no matter what they try, they can't lose the weight because the weight keeps them safe. But it's only when they access that belief and the story that suddenly they're able to lose weight, and they want to This is what happened.

**Speaker A:** We can look at, just because you brought up discipline a few times, just to examine that word a little more. We can look at— I don't believe in it. No, I don't. I understand how it came to be. And same with like the word laziness. I would say that the word discipline is someone who is unaware of how say someone who studies all the time does their studying or what's driving them, and they call that discipline, just in the way that they don't see themselves doing that, they don't understand why, and they call that lazy. So it's kind of like a vague word where they see someone doing something and they say, I need to do that thing. They don't know how, so the way is to yell at yourself or say, I should do that, I should be disciplined.

**Speaker F:** So yeah, the problem arises when you try to replicated without understanding how to do it correctly, without loving the process.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, they might not be able to do it simply because they have such neediness towards it also, that wanting it so.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I mean, this is all so new. I think it's— I enjoy remembering that these ideas really haven't been around for that long. For the longest time, the only real motivation was an empty stomach. Or that one was in danger or was gonna either freeze or burn to death, right? Those are real motivations, and you certainly don't need discipline for that, right? So all of this is like first world problems, really.

**Speaker C:** Yes, you know,

**Speaker F:** and while we were talking about wanting, I remember when I heard about the problems with wanting. I was like, how am I going to be able to do anything? What's going to motivate me? Like, am I going to drift endlessly if I ditch wanting?

**Speaker D:** Many practitioners, right?

**Speaker F:** Yeah. But, but what I realized is the more efficient way to motivate myself would be to make a choice. So like you were saying, Papa, making cost-benefit analysis and making a choice rather than wanting or wanting to want or determining that I have a need and all of that stuff. It has to be a choice right now, and that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

**Speaker D:** Much simpler.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And those choices will compound, right? They'll start— part of that choice will be surrounding yourself with more noble people, right? And then it's going to be a whole lot easier to make that choice when you're around noble people.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it snowballs, right? Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And also, we change over time also, because now Ron looks like he signed out, but in another 5 years, he might be this person, the development guru who's got the Rolls-Royce banging the hotties, got this cult down somewhere else.

**Speaker B:** I mean, there's no reason why I can't do that and still be— and

**Speaker A:** there's No reason to speculate either way, right?

**Speaker D:** And in that whole conversation of where so many practitioners come to that point of feeling like, if I realize emptiness, I'm just going to drift, or worse, I'll just be at the bar all day every day, or, you know— See,

**Speaker B:** that's actually something that I don't agree with. You know, I remember Ryan earlier on, you said you can kind of predict the future. You're able to like see how things are going to unfold based off present situations.

**Speaker D:** Been joking.

**Speaker C:** No, no, but I can, I can, I have to be able to be able to— I saw, you know, you can— I saw this patient today, I know within 4 to 6 weeks he's going to end up in hospital.

**Speaker B:** So in the same way, I can, I can kind of see the, the direction that my life is heading in. I can't really— I wouldn't be able to tell you the specifics, but I, I can tell the, the general direction it's going to go in based off the way I was raised, you know, my household, the people I surrounded myself with. You know, like career-wise, business-wise, financially, this, that. But I feel like the only differences with the practice is there's, there's no attachment to the lifestyle. Yeah, you know, I still think my life is gonna unfold in more or less a similar outcome regardless of my perspective of it. The only thing I can really do with this practice is get more out of the same experiences that are bound to happen regardless.

**Speaker C:** But anything can happen along the way also, because this is like the weather. You can predict what happens tomorrow, but once you go a few days down the line, 2 weeks, 3 weeks down the lane, there's too much chaos theory over it. So even with this thing, I can predict what happens now, I can predict what happens over the next few days and weeks. I can't predict what happens down the line in years.

**Speaker D:** Sure.

**Speaker C:** I just can't predict that.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, me neither. That's what I was saying. I can't predict the specifics, but I'm able to see the general direction based

**Speaker C:** off— I would have never predicted that I've not had a drink in years. I've not smoked any weed in years.

**Speaker A:** And so it's just— And these predictions, have you ever handled a gun?

**Speaker B:** Are you asking me?

**Speaker A:** So one of the rules— there are like 4 rules when you're handling a gun, like when you're at a gun range, for example. One of the most important is— well, there are 2 that I'll mention— that you want to make sure at all times you're acting like the gun is loaded, right? So you're not pointing it around at other people because you know, you could forget to unload the gun at one point, right? And the other one would be not to point the gun anywhere you would shoot it. And I think this is good analogy for wisdom, that you can look at your life and see where the gun's pointing, kind of like understand that, hey, if I don't see much gratification in going out of my way to get this job, I'm probably not going to go and get this job, right? You can see where the gun is pointed. But it's also important to make sure to look at the gun and make sure that it's the same gun, because you talk about wanting a family and all these things that you know they'll happen. I think sometimes we conflate the current gun with the old gun, the old habits. That are starting to change.

**Speaker C:** In my heart of hearts, I know I'm never going to get a family, okay? Because right now there is too much wanting and neediness attached to it. So what I need to do, I need to do a piece of work to cut down on the neediness and the wanting. I know I can let go to Shiva, but Shiva can only do so much. Once I get my neediness and wanting, Shiva is going to tell me, see, bro, you got to sort out the neediness and the wanting. And just let me sort it out. But you're coming in too much. You're getting in the way even with the needlessness of wanting. So that's when I say, okay, fine, I do a work where the charge goes. I need to tell myself that whether I have a family or not, I'm okay as I am and my life is amazing. I don't care if I have a family or not. Then once I get to that stage, the next week or two weeks, I'll get a girlfriend.

**Speaker D:** Could be. Could well be. Certainly you could be, but it could

**Speaker B:** be that you won't.

**Speaker D:** But you will be more on balance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, I used to be the exact same way. I used to really want a girlfriend, you know, eventually start a family one day. And then I started going through this, this nihilism phase, kind of where everything was meaningless, this, that, you know, like I was talking about earlier. And I, I decided that I didn't want to have a family and that I didn't want to have children. And at this present moment right now, all I can really say is that I neither want one nor don't want one. I will just accept as it comes up, who knows whether it does or not.

**Speaker C:** I did ayahuasca for the first time, and then I realized, wait a second, I don't exist, the world doesn't exist, everything— I come with nothing, I leave with nothing, everything I work for doesn't matter, nothing matters. What's the meaning of life? This is so bleak. And then I went to India. I was having a knee operation. So I'm just banged up in hospital. I have to listen to my mom all day long. I come back home. I'm staying at home. There isn't anything else to do but smoke weed all day long. So I'm just lost in this hell. I'm just wondering, okay, man, what do I do? And at that time, actually, I met the girl whom I actually felt most in love with at that time ever. So, so then, so what I did was I got the ayahuasca from the UK from eBay, and I made the ayahuasca. I made it for 6 hours in 2 separate vessels, and I got it done. And I said, okay, man, you got me into this, you get me out of it. This is so bleak. I come with nothing, leave with nothing. What's the meaning of life? There's no meaning. And this is the thing, and I'm just so bleak. And then she told me, but I've just told you you're God. And then I said, okay, fine. And then she said, live every day with bliss. So then I started doing that. Then now I find there's an even better answer than living with bliss, and which is being real. And so that's where I am now. But then now I'm thinking there is nothing real also. So it's like, oh, so the fabric of my reality is just breaking down over the last few days. It's just, yeah. So if you ask me what's changed a lot for me, for me, like Ron, your question at the beginning is meeting Dan and meeting you guys suddenly. And the practice, the fabric of my reality is just breaking down. And it's like, wait a second, I'm just this. I thought I had free will. I thought I had determinism. I thought I could anything I wanted in my life. It's nothing. So now once I let go, it's like, okay, man, I'm on this treadmill or this movie that's playing and I'm just an actor and I just have to watch it play. And then I'm thinking, okay, maybe the only way to change things around here in my life is to change the software.

**Speaker F:** Well, the interesting thing about reality is that we'll never know which reality is true because we all perceive reality in a slightly different way.

**Speaker B:** Subjectively.

**Speaker F:** Yes, subjective is the right word. So if you think of seeing a microscopic image with different brands of microscopes, and the different brands use different compositions to make different qualities of glasses, so everybody's reality is going to be— everybody's image is going to be slightly different.

**Speaker C:** It's like the people with Seven Blind Men and the Elephant.

**Speaker F:** Oh, I don't know about that.

**Speaker B:** Basically, I'm sorry, it's your story, you explain it. I just got excited when I heard you say it.

**Speaker C:** And that person who touches the ear and he says, oh, it's got this thing, who touches the trunk and he says something else, touches the horn, says something else, or the tusks and he says something else. So different people, the tail. So they have 7 different versions. And so I feel in terms of truth, there are people who know the truth. For example, in my mind, one is the people who do astral projection. I feel those guys know the actual truth of what's happening because they visit external worlds and consensual realities that actually exist, and they know the truth of what's happening around the world.

**Speaker B:** I actually have a— well, hold on.

**Speaker D:** I just want to say, how do we know that their accounts are objective truth and not just more subjective.

**Speaker C:** There are two people that are different people who've gone to the same places and found the same things, and they've met each other over there, come back and shared viewpoints.

**Speaker A:** Ryan, explain to me what you mean when you say the fabric of your reality is collapsing.

**Speaker C:** The fabric of my reality is collapsing is that, see, I thought until last week or a couple of weeks ago that I had determinism. I had free will. If I wanted to lose weight and I wasn't losing weight, it was just because whatever. It was just too much charge attached to it, or like I've got enough. So now I just feel that there is this subject-object differentiation. So if the seat of my consciousness is not here and it can be here, here, here, and there and everywhere, then where is the question of free will and self-control? Then how can I have self-control if there is no self? And then if this— let's see, suppose—

**Speaker A:** can I point something out?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it sounds more like it's your belief system that's collapsed.

**Speaker A:** We have— so when we talk about reality, obviously we don't know what the elephant is, but we do have like our sensual inputs, right? We have the five senses. Of being able to touch the elephant. And that's the reality we have, right? The feeling of the elephant. And oftentimes the person who's touching the elephant, they'll get into conceptualization, right? They'll start, oh, this elephant must have a nose because I'm touching its foot, right? But you don't know that. That's not reality. That's the conceptualization, right? So when we say our fabric of reality is collapsing, we're really just investigating and knowing that Oh, I really don't know if there's a nose on this elephant. I'm just touching its foot.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker F:** So, but the foot is real to you. So relatively real to you. But the nose is not. Right. That's that.

**Speaker A:** For even more exact, the sensations on my hand are real, right? The rough skin is real or whatever.

**Speaker D:** Well, yes.

**Speaker A:** As much as possible.

**Speaker D:** Indeed. And we don't have to be insistent about those fabrications of the mind being unreal, we can say they are fabrications of the mind.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, so we don't get averse by them, but we just see them as something happening, the mind's interpretation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I have a question more specifically for you, Dan. So I know that, you know, you recall, as I said earlier, about how there were the different levels of insight, how there was awareness with the ego, then awareness or association with awareness, association with consciousness, etc. So from what I've read, all these different associations, all these different levels of insight, they're all altered states of consciousness, except for the last one, where everything syncs up to itself, transcends everything else. And that is the one unaltered state of consciousness. So with that being said, I just wanted to ask you, what is your

**Speaker C:** moment-to-moment

**Speaker B:** perception of reality like?

**Speaker D:** Very ordinary and delightful. Um, dhammas might come and go They come and go. I see them kind of like the weather. It's a good analogy. I have a wife, as you can see. I have a job. It's all very ordinary and marvelous at the same time.

**Speaker F:** You just had a beer today?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I can probably tell you better because I am not on his level, but I live with him, so I can see how we interpret the same events kind of differently. Dan is more like seeing things as they are and not creating anything more, you know, not projecting anything onto it. If there's a crisis, it's crisis. He doesn't impose any subjective color onto it. He doesn't necessarily— he would react, but he doesn't, what would I say, elaborate

**Speaker C:** on that and put meaning like, this happened, there's a crisis, I fucked this up, why did I fuck this up, what was wrong with with me.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah. Oh shit, I fucked it up. Oh, Anagami. Oh, like none of that.

**Speaker B:** All right, so on top of that, I have another question for you, Dad. Is there a center point for your experience? There's no center? Completely dissolved? Indeed.

**Speaker D:** If a center were to arise, it would be seen as something that arises and passes away. To take something as a center is just that, is to take it as a center. So that any, any, anything that could be called self, if you can point

**Speaker F:** at it, it's not it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** right.

**Speaker D:** Anything, anything.

**Speaker B:** So I'm assuming you've reach the, like, the 9th jhana, stuff like that?

**Speaker D:** Oh well, I mean, I haven't read about jhanas very much at all. I like Dhammarato's presentation of jhana, which is that the first is all that's necessary until it's not, until you just don't really care about it much anymore. Um, around the time that Dhammarato was encouraging me to teach, um, He said something along the lines of, welcome to the club, now we won't talk about the club anymore. Because it's— there's the, the more it's thought about, spoken about, I can certainly tell you that I was able to report a diminishing and diminishing concern for where I was on the path or my degree of insight or attainment or anything like that. As my relationship with Dhammarato went on, I just stopped caring. And that turns out to be a qualification in a sense.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, we just— I always find those maps to be triggering a kind of wanting in me. Like, you know, I tend to become very goal-oriented. Okay, I'm introducing new potentially confusing words.

**Speaker D:** That's okay.

**Speaker B:** Not at all.

**Speaker F:** No, it's because in a previous video call we explored about goals and goal orientation and everything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Anyway, yeah. Those kind of maps can trigger wanting and attachment to the path. But it's definitely, again, I like to think that those paths were drawn up by a person who was talking from their own experience and had probably studied others' experience. But there cannot be one single or two paths. Everybody can have different paths, and thanks to today's kind of lifestyle, it's very difficult to maintain one particular way or definition of enlightenment, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I wanted to say, because I feel like, you know, you have all these different teachings and they label the same things in different ways, but at the end of the day Awakening within itself is universal. It's, you know, awareness.

**Speaker C:** I feel sometimes enlightenment might be different from the end process. Enlightenment to me is just that loss of the self.

**Speaker B:** I think enlightenment is the end point.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think we're in— but there are different things.

**Speaker C:** For example, with the great work in Western esoteric magic, it's about the Philosopher's Stone at the end. With the Dzogchen, it's Rigpa. And Rigpa is the end of the Buddhist progressive insight. So all these journeys, they'd have their different end parts and they don't map onto each other that readily either.

**Speaker D:** Well, it's dodgy territory when we start to equate what one teaching says with And this was a major challenge for me at some point, was here's all of these ancient teachings, and in most of these teachings we find very convicted language. The teacher is saying, this is the way, all other ways are false. What I realized at some point is that when these teachings were being given, they were probably speaking to people who were sacrificing goats.

**Speaker B:** To try to— I think, I think you were right, honestly, when you said that experience or enlightenment, it's just the end of the self. But I also think that that is within itself the endpoint, you know. That's why earlier on I asked Dan if there was a center in his experience, because the way I see it, as long as there's still a center point from which you are experiencing, there's still a self. And once that center point has been completely and permanently dissolved, then you're there.

**Speaker D:** So yeah, but you see, but I would— I certainly wouldn't tell anyone that I never have the experience of being behind my eyes, but that's an experience. Does that make sense? And it's not— it's not around all the time, and it's never been around all the time. But I remember a meditation in which I realized that it's not around all the time, where in delusion I had been thinking that it was somehow ticking along in the background. Certain aspects, certain experiences, flavors, sets of sensations, thoughts, feelings that I deemed to be Dan, I assumed were somehow maintained somewhere when my attention was not on them. And during that sit, I saw—

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that's actually— that can trigger acceptance and ultimate realization in you when the brain goes, this is too much, I'm gonna shut up.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly— that's actually, that's the first step to insight.

**Speaker C:** I go through meditation and the self is going to dissolve, when actually the self dissolves along the way lots of times. I'm keeping it alive with the craving and the jumping and this thing.

**Speaker B:** The real insight comes when your brain kind of collapses on itself, realizes that it could never possibly know the truth.

**Speaker D:** Sure, sure. For me, it was an experience of how things actually already are. Yeah, I love speaking about the path in subtractive terms. It's a process of subtraction as opposed to achievement, attainment, getting something, changing something. It's about seeing things as they already are. And so what I saw in that sit was the way things had always been was that there was an experience coming and going that I took to be Dan, and that it was indeed an experience coming and going.

**Speaker C:** It's like Rupert Spira says, if someone asks you about tea and coffee and you choose coffee, there's no thought between tea and coffee and coffee, but there are these other filler thoughts, some of which, which with I and that I takes responsibility for all the other thoughts.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, right, right.

**Speaker F:** So you— it's not that you always prefer coffee, you sometimes maybe prefer tea, but you're making a generalization based on the number of times you've reached for coffee, right?

**Speaker C:** So, but even— not even that, it's just a random thought that came, right? Okay, thoughts that we have are just random thoughts that come. And we are not creating the thoughts. It's just random thoughts that are coming.

**Speaker A:** Well, tell me this, Ryan.

**Speaker C:** Would— tell me this.

**Speaker A:** Say there's a new Marvel movie coming out, for example. Would someone 1,000 years ago, would he have the thought, I want to see that Marvel movie?

**Speaker B:** Of course not.

**Speaker A:** So that is to say that The thoughts that we have are conditioned by what we're experiencing now, right? If coffee didn't exist, you wouldn't want that coffee. So it must be then that is like relying on some kind of past memory, wouldn't you say?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but there's no me that's generating that coffee thought. There's filler thoughts about me, and I think those me is taking responsibility for the coffee thought also and all the

**Speaker D:** other So we, right, so we deem certain thoughts to be, quote, central.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that's what I was trying to point out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker C:** That's just an I-thought. So I'm thinking about coffee. I'm thinking, I see, I'm not thinking about coffee. I'm thinking about Florida. I'm thinking about Catch-22. I'm thinking about Phantom Comics, whatever. So there are 4 random thoughts that just came, okay? And then I mean, the other thing that blew my mind in this to-and-fro question and answer session was the guy's follow-up question was they did this YouTube experiment. He heard about this experiment on YouTube, and it's there on the internet. I think we've all heard about it, is that they had to ask these people to choose one of two things randomly and quickly. And then when something flashed on a screen and they chose it instantly, and when they did the fMRI, they found out they'd made the decision 6 seconds earlier.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** And so, so this is— so these are all these thoughts that are coming. And so there's these thoughts about your Florida Catch-22, fandom, and whatever. And then in between there's that, okay, I'm, I'm talking now, or I'm talking too much, or whatever. So this is the thing, the I'm talking too much takes responsibility for all the other thoughts about Panthema, Mandala, or Florida Catch-22.

**Speaker F:** Because you mentioned fMRI, it triggered my inner nerd, so I'm just gonna mention the way I perceive self is process. What you're saying, random thought, is basically automatic process that you don't have to consciously deliberately process. So it seems like a random thought to you, and it may seem like it's not part of you, but it actually is if we consider there is a you. But on the flip side, the random thoughts and the deliberate thoughts, none of those are you because they're intertwined with what's happening outside you.

**Speaker C:** I mean, you are awareness. Exactly. But these random thoughts that are coming to me are brilliant and super helpful thoughts. They're not critical, painful thoughts. They're like Thought this, thought this, thought this, this, this.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. So indeed, we— it's a mistake to make an enemy of thought. Yeah, yeah, thoughts can be very useful. The, the— I think the best way of speaking about the thinking mind is as a tool. Yes, yeah, I agree.

**Speaker F:** You can never get rid of thoughts, right?

**Speaker B:** You can only see them as they are.

**Speaker D:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** I think that's a tool that if we know how to use the hammer, they can be helpful, right? But if we don't and we're smashing our fingers with it, not so helpful.

**Speaker B:** I like using scalpel for that analogy. And then we can look after a scalpel. Do some surgery. But you give a toddler a scalpel?

**Speaker C:** Uh-oh. We are toddlers. We are toddlers given machine guns as an analogy, you know, like the choice that we have around us, the problems that are around us. We give 18-year-olds alcohol and drugs.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I feel like we're all really toddlers on the inside. At the end of the day, the first experience that your brain has ever had was you as a child. And it doesn't matter how much your body physically ages, it's still the same thing that's always looking out.

**Speaker D:** That kind of basic identity is created early, isn't it? And everything else is a layer on top, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And when you shed those layers, you start to feel more childlike because, you know, I recently read this book, or I'm actually— well, this is actually the book that I'm reading right now. It's called Contemplating the Nature of Experience by Rupert Spira. And there are a lot of very insightful quotes in that book. One of the things that he said that stuck with me is that time is created by the mind and space is created by the senses.

**Speaker F:** Space is created by the senses. I get that time is created by the mind for sure. Can you elaborate on how space is created by senses?

**Speaker B:** So, well, well, I need like a moment to like put my thoughts together.

**Speaker C:** I think I'm in this room and then my eyes tell me how far it is, my voice tells me Yeah,

**Speaker B:** well, yeah, exactly, because your senses, they include vision, smell, touch, you know. You see something in the distance and you perceive that as separate from you and far away from you, and your mind creates that sense of separation and space through the senses. I was going to say— oh, sorry.

**Speaker F:** Anagami, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was saying, when you feel the air on your skin instead of another solidified object touching it. You have this sense of separation. And these two together, when the mind fabricates time and the senses separate space, it makes this fabrication of duality in your reality. So that's kind of what solidifies the belief that you are separate from everything else.

**Speaker F:** I get what you're saying, but at what point would you separate sensation from mind?

**Speaker D:** Always.

**Speaker F:** Sorry?

**Speaker B:** Always.

**Speaker F:** How would you? Well, if you didn't have a mind to interpret the sensation as such, how would you know it's a sensation?

**Speaker B:** Well, sensations are always aware of themselves. It's like I said before, an experience is simply a sensation with a story attached to it. The feeling of the sensation is the body, the body experiencing that, and then the idea behind the sensation is the mind giving it solidity. So every time I experience something—

**Speaker C:** The body has millions of sensations or even trillions of sensations at any point in time.

**Speaker F:** Okay, let me ask you a question. If I touch myself here, would you say the sensation is happening here or here?

**Speaker C:** Everywhere. It's happening there, it's happening along that line, and yes, it's happening right here.

**Speaker F:** It's happening here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** So if I do this and if I do this, is it the same sensation?

**Speaker B:** Well, it might feel different, it might be a different sensation because it's not in the same place in space or time, but it is in a sense the same thing. Because this is another thing that I read, the sensation itself, it doesn't have the differentiation of good or bad, it doesn't have any type of differentiation. A sensation is just a sensation. All these different concepts— good, bad, hot, cold— those are just the stories that the mind adds on to it. So, you know, every time, every time I'm experiencing something consciously, you know, putting my awareness towards it, I kind of, I try to divide the experience into its smaller components, which is kind of like what Vipassana, or an aspect of

**Speaker C:** it is like, it's like an inverted pyramid. Inverted pyramid is there's millions of sensations. With those millions of sensations, there's hundreds of thoughts attached to those sensations. Those hundreds of thoughts are attached to those sensations cause the meaning, and there are meanings attached to it. Then with those fewer meanings and emotions, there are much fewer actions, and then much fewer behaviors, and then they call the way down.

**Speaker F:** Yes, but what I'm trying to say is sensations basically are just data, right? Just input. But the idea that the sensations are different from the mind is not accurate. So we often think the mind is located in the brain or in the head, but to be honest, the mind is throughout the body. Rather, it's like the existence right? So a sensation is going to be interpreted as a sensation only when you interpret them. So that's why we have perception. So that's what I was trying to say, that the mind cannot be kind of separated. I agree with what Rupert was saying, that the mind creates time.

**Speaker D:** Oh, Rupert, the author.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, the author. That the mind creates time, but sensation creates space. I mean, I get where he's coming from, but I would say it's again the mind.

**Speaker D:** Um, oh, but Rupert would, would agree with that also. Rupert's very much— no, I agree with

**Speaker B:** what it is that you're saying, that all the sensations are created in the mind. But I'm saying as well that these sensations also give you the fabrication of space, because from the perspective of truth.

**Speaker A:** Truth.

**Speaker B:** You know, all of reality is just one seamless totality. Every sensation is free-falling in the center of infinity. So there is no center. But, right, you know, our sensations from the perspective of the brain fabricate a center and they fabricate a differentiation. Like, you know, I'm looking at the wall above my computer computer, and I see that as not exactly where I am, where this body has the experience thing.

**Speaker F:** You have that subject-object differentiation. Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** And this stuff's not good. Yeah, this stuff has function, it has its purpose.

**Speaker F:** Oh, I think at the relative level, I mean, away with the subject-object difference. What we can do is not cling to it or take it as the ultimate reality.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. And look at where it's not helpful, right? So for example, the extreme end of identification is narcissism, right? Ain't helpful. It ain't helpful. Maybe it would be worth this territorialism. Yeah, territorialism, all that stuff. Maybe it would be worth us in that situation seeing if there's anything we can do to soften our sense of self by seeing things more clearly, right? Yeah. So if narcissism is a malfunction, a disorder, And if we think about identification as on a spectrum, and perhaps all we're actually interested in is seeing precisely that it's a spectrum, that it moves around, yeah, right, that is different in each moment. And indeed, seeing that really dissolves the whole thing. It's just seeing.

**Speaker C:** Let's move from narcissism into the ultimate narcissism, which is I am everything. There is no subject-object differentiation. I've reached enlightenment. I can't get any more.

**Speaker D:** Well, indeed, yes, the spiritual ego. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And no, because from, from what I've read, at least, that there is a trap there, but the trap is avoided by first of all realizing no self. Because if you try to have the realization of infinity, that I am everything, without first realizing no self, you are ultimately just projecting your own ego onto everything else.

**Speaker F:** Also, I think the right attitude can help with that, to set the foundation. If you got the preliminary practices sorted, you've got that kind of integrated into your being, you're less prone to interpret no-self, non-duality as narcissism, right?

**Speaker D:** Well, yeah, I think that where Ryan started was the the spiritual ego, right? Is the— let me— okay, I've found all these books, let me now make a new identity out of all of that.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Um, which, yeah, we can, we can all see if we open up Instagram.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, ego of not having an ego.

**Speaker D:** Yes. Yeah. And what a wonderful trap for one to find one's way out of,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker D:** I mean, if one can see that one is in that trap, then there's some really good fuel in that, I would say.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the trap collapses.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker F:** The ultimate aha moment, right?

**Speaker D:** Okay guys, I'm going to wrap things up here. Great seeing you all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is awesome.

**Speaker B:** It was a pleasure.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, so much fun.

**Speaker A:** Great to see you again, Ryan. I always really enjoy the discussions that we have. And Ron, it's great to meet you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was lovely to meet all of you. Debbie, Dan, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, good. So Ron, we're here every Tuesday. At the time that I called today, whatever that is for you. So you can expect 3 PM.

**Speaker F:** 3 PM.

**Speaker D:** 3 PM for you. So you can expect to hear from us this time next week.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. Yeah. Hey guys, more, more likely than not we'll be tagging in again.

**Speaker D:** Great. Then bye guys. All right, bye guys. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and Sangha friends is a free-flowing, informal sharing session where participants discuss their personal journeys into meditation and the Dharma, explore core Buddhist concepts, and debate the nature of practice and reality.

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and discussions:

### **Core Themes & Discussions**

1.  **Origins of Practice:** Multiple participants share how they found the path, often through a series of seemingly small, connected events (like clicking a link online) rather than a single dramatic moment. Stories include discovery via apps (Headspace), friends, psychedelic experiences, personal crises, and teachers like Daniel Ingram or Shinzen Young.

2.  **The Nature of the Path & Practice:**
    *   **Non-Linear Causation:** The talk opens with an analogy about defensive driving, emphasizing that events (like finding Dharma) are usually the result of a build-up of conditions, not one isolated moment.
    *   **"The path finds you":** A recurring sentiment that sincere interest pulls one toward the Dharma, often feeling beyond mere personal choice.
    *   **Skill Development:** Practice is framed as developing the skill of looking and investigating, which eventually becomes effortless and applicable in all life situations.
    *   **Critique of Force:** The group discusses how some interpretations of meditation (e.g., forcefully concentrating on the breath) can be aggressive, favoring approaches like Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation (TWIM) that emphasize relaxation, gladdening the mind, and smiling.

3.  **Central Goal: The End of *Dukkha* (Suffering/Dissatisfaction):**
    *   The ultimate aim is consistently identified as *Dukkha Nirodha*—the cessation of dissatisfaction.
    *   **"Little Nirvanas":** Nirvana is reframed not as a distant, grandiose goal but as the everyday "cooling off" or moments of peace and satisfaction available in the present.
    *   **Pain vs. Suffering:** A key distinction is made. Pain (physical or emotional) is seen as inevitable, while *suffering* is the optional mental elaboration, clinging, and storytelling we add to it.

4.  **Debate on Desire, Suffering, and Worldly Life:**
    *   A lively debate ensues, primarily with Ryan (Speaker C), who argues for the value of suffering, desire, and worldly drama (e.g., career, family, challenges) as motivators and essential contrasts for happiness.
    *   Others counter that the Dharma points to an **unconditional happiness** that is not dependent on worldly highs and lows. They suggest that much worldly striving is based on "shoulds" and conditioned wants ("wanting to want") rather than genuine desire.
    *   The concept of **Wu Wei** (effortless action) and surrender is discussed as an alternative to disciplined striving. The idea is to let go of the ego's "clenched fist" control, allowing life to flow naturally.

5.  **Nature of Self and Reality:**
    *   **Anatta (No-Self):** There is deep exploration of the illusory nature of the self. The self is described as a collection of thoughts, sensations, and stories that arise and pass away, not a solid, central entity.
    *   **Fabricated Reality:** Participants discuss how our perceived reality is a mental fabrication. Our senses create the illusion of space, and the mind creates the illusion of time and a separate self.
    *   **Ordinary Marvel:** Dan (Speaker D), who presents as having deeper insight, describes his moment-to-moment perception as "very ordinary and delightful," without a fixed center, simply seeing experiences come and go like weather.

6.  **Pitfalls and Maps:**
    *   **Spiritual Ego:** The trap of building a new identity around being a "seeker" or "enlightened" is acknowledged.
    *   **Usefulness of Maps:** Maps of progress (like the Progress of Insight) are seen as potentially useful but also dangerous if they trigger goal-oriented craving and attachment. The emphasis is on the direct experience of release from *dukkha* rather than attaining stages.

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**

The talk is characterized by **camaraderie, open inquiry, and a lack of dogmatism**. Participants feel free to challenge Buddhist orthodoxy (as Ryan does) while others gently point back to the core principles of ending suffering through clear seeing. The session concludes with an emphasis on the simplicity of the goal: seeing things as they are, right here and right now, and finding that this ordinary experience is "good enough as it is."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about meditation, the spiritual path, and understanding reality. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Defensive Driving / Car Accident:** (Speaker A)
    *   **Metaphor:** Used to explain how we often misattribute causes to single, dramatic moments (the turn that caused the crash), when the real cause is a pattern of behavior leading up to it (driving too close, being in a "clump" of cars).
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that spiritual awakening or life changes are rarely about one "click" or moment, but a buildup of events and patterns. It challenges the notion of a single, identifiable cause.

2.  **Rabbit Hole:** (Speaker A)
    *   **Metaphor:** Describes the process of discovering meditation resources online—starting with one click (e.g., a Twitch stream) and then progressing deeper into a subject over years.
    *   **Purpose:** To depict the non-linear, exploratory, and sometimes accidental nature of the spiritual journey in the digital age, contrasting with the deliberate "travel to India" of the past.

3.  **The Path Finds You:** (Speaker B/C)
    *   **Metaphor:** A reversal of the active search ("you find the path"). The idea is that one gets "pulled into" the practice by an internal force.
    *   **Purpose:** To express the feeling of inevitability and lack of total personal control in embarking on a deep meditation practice. Speaker C says, "there's no choice really. You just get pulled into it."

4.  **Tuning a String / Tightening the Ship:** (Speaker D)
    *   **Metaphor:** Used to explain the Buddha's teaching on Right Effort. The mind sometimes needs to be "tuned a little tighter" and sometimes "loosened off."
    *   **Purpose:** To counter the idea that meditation is always about forcing or always about relaxing. It's about skillful adjustment, like tuning an instrument for the right sound.

5.  **The Raft:** (Speaker F)
    *   **Metaphor:** Briefly referenced. In Buddhist teaching, the Dharma is like a raft used to cross a river (suffering); once across, you don't carry the raft on your back.
    *   **Purpose:** To suggest that extreme practices (like free soloing) can be a tool to achieve presence, but they are not the final goal and can be let go of for more sustainable methods.

6.  **The Weather:** (Speaker D)
    *   **Metaphor:** Used to describe the post-insight perception of reality. Thoughts, feelings, and experiences come and go "like the weather."
    *   **Purpose:** To convey a sense of ordinary, non-personal, and ever-changing experience without clinging or aversion.

7.  **The Inverted Pyramid:** (Speaker C)
    *   **Metaphor:** Describes how millions of raw sensations give rise to hundreds of thoughts, then fewer meanings/emotions, then even fewer actions and behaviors.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how our solid sense of self and behavior is built upon a vast, unstable base of fleeting sensory data, a core insight of Vipassana.

8.  **The Scalpel / Toddler with a Machine Gun:** (Speaker B/C)
    *   **Metaphor:** The thinking mind is a tool like a scalpel, useful if skilled but dangerous if not. Modern humans are like "toddlers given machine guns" with the choices and powers we have.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the need for wisdom in using the mind and to comment on the overwhelming complexity of modern life.

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **Steve Jobs' "Connecting the Dots" / Hindsight:** (Speaker C)
    *   **Story:** Referencing Steve Jobs' idea that you can't connect the dots looking forward, only looking backward.
    *   **Purpose:** To agree with the defensive driving metaphor—the pattern and cause of events (or the spiritual path) only become clear in retrospect.

2.  **The Seven Blind Men and the Elephant:** (Speaker C/F)
    *   **Analogy:** Different blind men touch different parts of an elephant (trunk, leg, tail) and come to wildly different conclusions about what the elephant is.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate subjective reality and the limitations of individual perception. It's used to argue that no one person (e.g., astral projectors) has a monopoly on objective truth.

3.  **Learning the Drums:** (Speaker D)
    *   **Story:** Speaker D shares that learning drums felt easy and natural, "as though it was happening to me," unlike the struggle he saw in hundreds of other students.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue against "discipline" as forceful willpower. True skill development flows naturally when there's genuine interest and lack of resistance, paralleling the meditation path.

4.  **Gun Safety Rules:** (Speaker A)
    *   **Analogy:** The rules of handling a gun: 1) Always treat it as loaded, 2) Never point it at anything you don't intend to shoot.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate "wisdom" (paññā). You can see where your life/habits are "pointed" (predicting outcomes), but you must also inspect the "gun" itself (your present-moment intentions and cravings) because it may have changed from old patterns.

5.  **The fMRI Decision Experiment:** (Speaker C)
    *   **Story:** References a scientific experiment where fMRI scans showed the brain making a decision seconds before the person was consciously aware of making it.
    *   **Purpose:** To challenge the notion of free will and the solidity of the "chooser" self, suggesting thoughts and decisions arise on their own.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories collectively emphasize **process over event, investigation over belief, and natural unfolding over forced will**. They move away from grand, singular moments of enlightenment toward a gradual, often messy, and deeply personal journey of seeing things clearly.
