### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello friends. Today is the 4th of January, and today we'll be talking about dependent origination or Paticcasamuppada. But we're going to be talking about it in a way of having two benefits. One benefit is for students to understand how the mind works, because actually this is a very clear description of the processes of how the mind works. And then the second benefit is so that we can identify unwholesome thoughts, unwholesome states, so that we can make changes to it. Now, the interesting thing about Paticcasamuppada, or dependent origination, is that there are several places along the way where wisdom can enter, when you can see exactly what is going on and make changes. That's in fact one of the most important qualities of Paticcasamuppada, is that it is geared around right noble effort to make a change, and that the faster the mind is, or the faster your Sati is, the faster you can figure things out. Then the less Dukkha there will be, or none at all. Now, it's normally stated to have 12 steps, 12 steps of dependent origination, but especially the Western mind, but the human mind wants to take one step after another, after another, starting from step number 1 all the way to step 12 as a sequence to where in fact, uh, there are nuances that we want to cover today that can help you understand that it's not just 1 through 12, that in fact today's teaching is going to be more of 9 steps rather than 12. And I'll talk about, uh, how we collapse some of the steps a little bit later. But always the sequence starts with ignorance, and that we are born ignorant. We don't know how to do much of anything when we're, uh, newborn babes. And so, um, as we are born and start being born, things begin to happen And a lot of the things that begin to happen is, is that the infant child begins to do things, learn things, experience things, have feelings about things, etc., like that. And so, uh, as we are born in ignorance and remain in ignorance, uh, in the ordinary person's life they will continue to, let us say, pile up experiences, actions, things like this. The Pali word for this, by the way, is Samskara. And I don't think that we have a good solid one-word working definition for Samskara. Every translator kind of chooses his own word for it, and so it takes quite a bit of description. One of the ways of describing it is that it's just old memories, but more so, it's also habits. And if you keep repeating the habits over and over again, they get frequented up. So, maybe a good analogy would be that you walk into the city library, or maybe a university or school library, and all of the books are no longer arranged upon the shelves, but in fact, they're just piled into the middle of the floor. And this is how Samskara operates. It doesn't have an organization. That it just— things are in a big pile. And so if you have habits, what that means would be repeated behaviors that will repeat over and over again. And you can kind of think of that as having several or maybe dozens of books that have multiple copies. And so if you've got 10,000 copies of one book and you have, let us say, 100,000 books and all of the other books that are in that pile are just one copy of that book, then the likelihood of you picking up that one book that has 10,000 copies there would be the book that you would pick up. So in the regard of the Samskara, what we actually mean then is that for one thing, it's both current actions, thoughts, feelings, behaviors, habits, etc., and old ones in the past. That in fact, today, if you have an action, a behavior, a sequence of thoughts, a feeling, then that's probably going to go kind of on the top of the pile. But the pile is broad, so the likelihood of you picking up something that you just put on that pile is fairly likely. And if you start piling on a lot of stuff current, let us say by practicing the Dhamma By practicing correctly, by staying in a very, very good state over and over and over again, that's like piling a lot of a new book, copy after copy after copy on top. And that's a very good thing. It buries the old stuff down in the past. And so, this is a way of looking at Samskara as a base for how things operate. And now, the next thing is going to be in the list, it would be Vinaya, which is consciousness. Now, consciousness Actually, in the teaching of the Buddha, there are 6 kinds of consciousness. Besides the 5 that are associated with the external body, we also have an internal consciousness, which we'll be talking about—mind consciousness—in just a moment. But as we start, I want to talk about the 5 aggregates, because the 5 aggregates that the Buddha teaches about are all found within the Paticcasamuppada. Now, within the Sankhara, there are bodily Samskaras which are built-in things. For instance, musicians have a certain kind of Sankhara built in, we would call muscle memory. Which would be different than an athlete. And so we have bodily Samskaras, we also have verbal Samskaras, which has to do with the way you speak, the language you speak, the accents, the dirty words that you use are all built into that. In fact, in the culture that I was raised in, using a lot of, let us say, off-language, low-class language was very common. So as I grew up, I grew up speaking like a sailor until I joined the Navy, and then I really learned how to cuss. And so as a good little Buddhist boy, I had to start changing the way that I spoke. So they didn't use such low-class language anymore. And that means then that we can change these Samskaras. Now, the third kind of Samskara would be mental Samskaras, which have more to do with attitudes and feelings rather than thought processes. That the thoughts that we have are generally current, But the thoughts that we have will be influenced by old feelings, old ideas, old concepts, and old attitudes. So Samskara is the basis of operation. So when we have some new consciousness, let us say that comes in through the eye, we see something. Then we automatically will want to make sense out of it. And how we make sense out of anything is by drawing on this pile of Samskara to make— to be able to perceive it. An example of that is, is that someone who has never seen— let us say has lived in a room for some reason their whole lives and they go outside and they see a tree, they've never seen a tree, never seen a picture of a tree, so that's something that they've never seen before. They don't have a concept of a tree until we actually see one. And so we have over time pulled in a lot of data from the senses, from the ears and the eyes and the taste and bodily contact and sensation, etc. Like that, we pulled in a huge amount of data.. They're all part of this base of Samskara, so that when we begin then to make sense out of what we see, that making sense out of it is called perception. In the Pali, they use a particular word called anamarupa, and anamarupa means that we see something that's real, the rupa, and we try to make sense out of it by naming it, by understanding it, and that's nama. So we take the rupa and we make nama out of it using the Sankhara as a base. Everybody does this. However, we can begin to change the way this procedure operates. Now another way that we can think of perception is storytelling, coming to some idea or some conclusion that there is a tree, or there is a monkey in the tree, or the monkey is gathering coconuts out of the tree by twisting them and having them fall to the ground, and that there is a keeper who is piling the coconuts into a pile. So this whole sequence can be seen in just a tenth of a second, but telling the story about it takes a little bit of time. So we wind up being storytellers, and everywhere we go, we have stories that we're telling. And in fact, these stories that we tell is stuff that we're making up about the moment, and we can call that thoughts. Now, these thoughts are influenced by the way that we feel and the way that we used to feel. It's influenced by our attitude currently and past attitudes that come out of the pile. So we wind up then with perception, we wind up telling a story. This story in the Pali, by the way, is called salyattana. This salyattana The story that we tell, if you dissect that Pali word, it actually means internal senses. The Sali Atana is like the Atana, and that you can think of it like this, that you cannot sense something in the mind that you haven't sensed on the.

**Speaker B:** Outside.

**Speaker A:** The all of the senses that we have bring together stuff that's going to be then rearranged, pounded, made into a story on the inside. But that creativity is not as creative as we think. What we're basically doing when the mind is being creative is taking bits and pieces out of the Samskara base and rearranging it and putting it together in a new way. Now the next part of Paticcasamuppada is called contact, or pañña, and this pañña, or contact, is what happens. In other words, we get a little shove or a little push or a little contact. We're not contacted by what the eyes see, see, we are contacted by what the mind sees after it's had a story told about it. And so it's the story that contacts us, not the actual stuff that we see. A good example of that would be that two observers are standing on this side of the street, and they look on the other side of the street and see someone walking. Now, each one of them has a completely different idea about the person who's walking. Let us give the example that somebody is dressed as a nun, and old nuns have it, you know, the Catholics are very famous for having fancy dressed nuns, and one of them is studying to be a priest, and so he's very humbled and he's very grateful to see the nun, and he wants to bow and scrape and all of that. And the other one went to Catholic school and had his hands repeatedly slapped and beaten by some old nun at the school. And so when he sees a nun, he's going to have just the opposite reaction to her. Now, the reactions that these people have is based upon their memory, based upon their old Sankhara, and that it wasn't the nun herself or the person dressed as a nun that made that contact. It was what they made out of it. So that contact then leads to feeling. Now, as we come to this point, I'd like to go back and redress the issue of the five aggregates. Now, the five aggregates that the Buddha talks about is very similar to the four foundations of mindfulness that you've all heard about. The four foundations of mindfulness being body, feelings, mental states, and mental objects. We're going to rearrange that a little bit so that we can make five out of it, and that would be body, the feelings, the Samskara, the consciousness, and the perception. So the stuff that we've just been talking about wind up being these 5 aggregates. Now, these 5 aggregates, the most important reason why the Buddha talks about these 5 aggregates is because there is no self there's no you there. That when we see that this is me or this is mine, that's because we're not really wise to what's really going on. That in fact, there is no self there. The self, when it is there, is a creation that happens from time to time that we'll talk about in just a moment. But first, we want to make sure that there was already no built-in self. Now, a lot of people will identify with the body. In fact, there are a huge number of industries worldwide that depend upon people making the mistake of identifying, "I am the body." What kind of businesses are those? How about the handbag industry? How about makeup? How about fashion, or even the whole clothing industry? How about the workout industry? In fact, anything that people will buy to help aggrandize, increase the self, make the self beautiful, make it better, etc., like that, all of those industries are counting on the people being ignorant about who they are, thinking that I am the body. All fashion, all high-heeled shoes, all bracelets, all jewelry, everything. If you can see it from that perspective, you can say, wow, identification with the body is really widespread. It is enormously widespread, and that you can see each one of you for yourselves, that you often will identify with the body. I, me, mine. In other words, we don't generally say I am thin, or excuse me, that the body is thin, the body is fat, the body is ugly, the body is beautiful. We almost always refer to it as I am thin, I am fat, I am beautiful, I am ugly. And when people put on makeup, then they say, "Oh, the face is more beautiful." No, they say, "I am more beautiful." And so this identification with the body, if we can see how strong that is, then we can also see how we identify also with all of our thoughts, all of our memories, all of our feelings, all of our perceptions, all of our consciousness. We identify with the self for all of those things, to where in fact the reality is that they're just processes. There is the process of seeing— not I see, but there is seeing— the process of making up a story, my story, I see that way is not correct, and yet our whole language is built that way, so that I, me, my can be seen in all of these various functions, except that the reality is that there is no self in any of those things. That's just the concept of me, but in reality There is no self in the memories. That's just memories. There is no self in the body. It's just a body. There is no self in the consciousness. There is just merely consciousness. And not only that, but consciousness is dependently arising. It too is dependent. Everything is dependent It depends upon what you see and what you don't see, and that when you're asleep, there's no consciousness. So when we are looking at what the mind is doing, basically that's that sixth sense door, and that's when we see my story, my belief system, my concepts, etc., like that, except it is just a story, just a concept. It doesn't belong to the self at all. Not yet. But after we have that contact, that's when feelings arise. Vedana. Now, when the feelings arise— and by the way, we have to make sure that we're not talking about— you see, in English we have two words that may mean basically the same thing, and that is emotion and feelings. But in fact, in the Pali, we're separating those out completely from emotion and feelings. And the word Vedana is not emotion, it's just bare-bone feeling. And there are three kinds. One is a pleasant feeling, an unpleasant feeling, which we could say liking. And some people will say, I like it. And then there is unpleasant feelings, which we can say not liking, or I don't like it. And then the third would be— it's not liking and not liking, It's a subtle feeling, but it is a feeling that in fact the third kind of feeling in the Pali is called a dukkha, a rupa Vedana, and in some places it's actually referred to as dukkha-sukkha Vedana, which means it's either both or not quite either one of them, but it's definitely a feeling. Now, one of the ways of looking at that kind of feeling is that it's confused. It's doubtful. It's not— you're not sure. In fact, everyone often has that in the state of feeling, but they're not sure how they feel. They don't feel much of anything. This third feeling then is actually associated with ignorance because we don't really know what we feel. Or how we feel, because it's subtle. And sometimes because we don't know what to feel or how to feel, we become confused about our feeling. This is the point— these feelings, this Vedana— is where the Second Noble Truth begins to kick in. That in fact, we could say that the entire teaching of Paticcasamuppada is nothing but a complete breakdown into the various forms of the Second Noble Truth: What is the cause of Dukkha? Now, immediately these feelings then will go from "I like it" into "I want it," or "I don't like it, I want to get rid of it," or if I'm not sure, I need to investigate or check it out or something. Now, um, I'm speaking in the language of I, me, and mind, where the reality is this process is actually quite fast and there's no self in it. There's just pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling, and undetermined or strange kind of feeling. Feels weird. How many of you ever heard somebody say it feels weird? You've heard that, huh? Okay, that's that third kind of feeling, is we don't know what to make of it. It feels weird, it feels strange, it feels, uh, incomplete somehow. And it's quite possible for that third kind of feeling to immediately rot into 'I don't like it.' Now, you've probably heard the, uh, that, uh, uh, what you don't know might be dangerous. You've heard this, the phrase, better the devil you know than the devil you don't. You've also heard the phrase fear of the unknown. Well, if you don't know how to feel, then we probably are going to not like how we feel. But when we feel, if we are wise to that, we can begin to see, oh, I feel weird, except that it's not weird, it's just an incomplete or in-between feeling or liking or pleasant experience or unpleasant experience. Or feeling. But when the mind is ignorant in the sense of these feelings, immediately what happens is that it goes to the next step, and that step is called Tanha. Now, Tanha is very important. Let's not overlook it or slide away from it, but in fact, this is the point where we begin to want. I like it, I want it. Or I don't like it, I want to do away with it. Or if I'm not sure, I need to either hate it or inspect it. So Tanha, actually there are three kinds, and these three kinds of Tanha fairly well map onto the three kinds of feelings. Except that now we've got fairly well blown, full-blown into the Second Noble Truth now, that when we talk about the Second Noble Truth of being greed, hatred, and delusion, it actually is not just the Vedana, but it's the Vedana with the Tanha. This is why the Mahayana often speak of it as the cause of Dukkha, the cause of dissatisfaction, comes from not the liking and the not liking, but it comes from attachment or clinging. And that's not true either. Tanha is wanting. It's not the full attachment, not yet. It's just a wanting. It's a thirst. That's in fact what the word Tanha actually means in the Pali. The original word for Tanha is thirst. Now, the suttas label three kinds of Tanha: Kamma Tanha, Bhavana Tanha, and Vibhavana Tanha. What do these mean? Well, Kamma Tanha means that I like it, I want it, I want to own it, I want to get it. Um, Bhava, Tanha is wanting to develop or to do it or to, uh, gain something. Uh, and this is actually that Bhava is the beginning of the self. In other words, it's the creation of the self. And then the third kind of Tanha is the Bhavana Tanha. Now, Bhavana has the word development, and some art will show it as pregnancy, like the becoming of a baby is done with pregnancy. So you can think of it as a pregnant place of becoming. Now, I've got a little analogy for you to help you understand this. Let us say that there is a party, a New Year's Eve party in fact, and the three states would be: I want to go to the party. Then there is party. And then the third one is, I want to leave the party. Okay, let's remember those three. I want to go to the party, I want to party, and I want to get out of the party. Now, um, the party is, uh, wanting to go to the party. That's the becoming. I want to become a partygoer. When we're in the party, what do we do at the party? Ivan What do you do at a party? You eat, you drink, you look, you try to take phone numbers, right? It's a collection. This is the Kamma, the Kamma, Tanha, the wanting to gain things. And then I want to go to the party is the becoming. That's the Bhava-khanha, I want to go, I want to become the party. And then the third kind is I want out, I want to leave. Okay, so we can see then these three kinds of Vedana map onto these three kinds of Tanha, and that then leads into the next step, which is the whole show that I want to talk about today, and that is Upadana. So, passa contact with the story that we told leads to Vedana. Three kinds of Vedana lead to three kinds of Tanha, and the three kinds of Tanha lead to Upadana. Now in these, uh, the Pali suttas, without talking about Upadana yet, I want to add the rest of the story. And the rest of the story is, um, uh, Bhava, which would be step number 10. Then it would be Jhati, or self. And then the 12th one would be Dukkha. But I want to rearrange those for you so that you can get a better understanding, because in fact that state of Bhavana, or becoming, doesn't happen after Upadana. It happens in conjunction with Tanha. And so those two overlap directly. Now the next one about Upadana is that Upadana is the grasping and clinging. And guess what? If you have clinging, you have already birthed a clinger, the one who clings. There is where the self is born. It is born in our desire to hold, to have. I want it. It's strong, it's not just thirst, it's dying of thirst basically. This Upadana then has both the quality of the birth of the self, and along with the birth of the self would be Dukkha. So you could say it this way: if the dissatisfaction is there, who is it that's dissatisfied? That's where the self comes from. Now, within the Buddhist teaching discussion, we have this word Anatta, and the word Anatta is the word "not a permanent self." In fact, a better translation would be "soul," because we think of a soul as something that doesn't change, that it is strong, it's so strong in fact that it survives death. And so we're not talking about that kind of soul when we talk about anatta. In fact, when we say anatta, that means no such thing as a soul. Well, where does the self come from? The self is a process that occurs. The self is something that is created along with the Tanha becoming Upadana. That's the birth of the self. In other words, if there's no clinging, there's nothing to be clinging. So when, let us say, our gay friend, or maybe a movie actor, or a lady is sitting in front of a mirror putting on lipstick with the thought of The lips look beautiful, therefore I look beautiful. That's the Tanha. In other words, she has a pleasant feeling that becomes the beginning of the self, and then the me that's born. Except that in that particular case, she's pleased with it, but then somebody comes in while she's putting that makeup on and says, "Oh, that's the wrong makeup for you." And now how does she feel? Not so good. So I would like to tell you the story about four woeful states. Now, the four woeful states are in fact part of the Upadana. When one goes into clinging, we go into clinging in one of basically four ways. Now these four are actually mutable a bit. They move around a bit. And so let's put the ones in that are the easiest to understand. And that one is the hungry ghost, the Piti. Now the Piti is very clearly, I want it, I want more of it. I can't get enough satisfaction. It's wanting and wanting and wanting and never becoming satisfied with what we get. We can have one car or two cars, or if you look at some folks like Jay Leno, how many cars does he have? The answer to that is not enough. Or you look at some of these rich people like Jeff Bezos. How much money does Jeff Bezos have? Not enough. How much money does Elon Musk have? Clearly, for Elon Musk, not enough. It's always wanting more and more and more and never becoming satisfied. This is the full-blown woeful state of Piti. Now, the next one would be hell. Now, hell has several forms. One of the qualities of hell is that it's hot. So if you get hot, that's a form of hell. So if the person or the entity is experiencing heat, then that would be a hell state. Now, one example of that is when you recollect about the past, and that past, then you remember something that happened that was painful, except that right now, as you remember it, is even more painful. We call this remorse. It almost to the point of wincing that you remember something that happened, may have happened 10 years ago. It may have happened in a way that nobody else is going to remember it but you. But you remember it, and it is downright painful when you remember that. We have remorse about it. This is a form of hell. Another form of hell is when we get really angry. We're so frustrated and so angry that we can't stand it. Okay, so hell would be the quality of not able to stand it. It's too hot, it's too dangerous. It's not just dangerous, it's the danger has already happened and now we're in hell. So the third one then would be the one that's the most common. And the one that's the most common is called a dumb animal. It's got that ignorance built into it and all the animals are dumb. And the ones that we're talking about here, the ones who are often the most dumb are human animals. We're dumb. We're ignorant sometimes. And the way that we see this is draft animals have no choice about what they do. Imagine that the horse is in a paddock. The farmer just leaves that paddock empty and lets that horse just go around and eat whatever he likes. And it's all good. And then that land is sold and the farmer dies or something. And the new owner comes in and he puts a harness on that horse, puts a plow behind that horse, and makes the horse plow up his own pasture so that the farmer, the new farmer, can then plant stuff that the horse is not ever going to eat. This is the tragic story of the horse, and everyone who has a job is living out that, especially when you don't like— you do what you're told to do, but you don't like it. And not only that, but you're not getting the benefit out of what you're doing. This is the woeful state of a dumb animal, and I would suggest that everybody here goes through that dumb animal state dozens of times during the day until you begin to see it. Then when you begin to see it, what that means is that you stop doing things that you don't want to do. Stop doing things that you don't like. Just stop. That doesn't mean to stop the activity. It means stop the don't liking. So you can keep the same job, but now what you do, you like doing it. There's a big difference. And in fact, taking the example of a software engineer, if he does not like the job, does not like doing the work, then his code is not going to be as good as if he's enjoying the heck out of the job that he's doing. He writes code he likes, and now he's in a pleasant state. But most of us are often in a place, even software engineers who sometimes like what they're doing, a lot of the times they don't. Maybe he just wrote the code and now he's trying it out, and it gets, let's say, a syntax error, and immediately he goes into not liking it. So this is the dumb animal state. Become aware of when you are doing things that you don't like to do. Maybe the right thing to do for that software engineer when he gets a syntax error is to get up and walk away. Come back to that syntax error when he can happily take care of it. But oh no, most of us are going to grumble and moan and feel bad while we're fixing that syntax error. And now the fourth kind of woeful state is referred to as the Asura. Now the Asura are lesser gods, they're very much like the Titans, and we have two ways of looking at the Titans. One of them is that they're all dressed up for battle, but they don't want to go to battle because all the gods that they would be battling with are better at battling than they are, even though they're dressed up for war. So what that means is fear. We're ready to go, but we're afraid to go. Going back to the story of the party, people who will go to the party and then sit at the side of the party, the wallflowers they call them, people who are not part— they're at the party, but they're not partying. What have they got on their mind? They want to go, they want to leave the party, they don't want to be here, and yet they sit here at the party. All right, so that's got the dumb animal quality, but it also has the quality of being afraid to go party. So the— there's another aspect of the Asuras, and that is they do go to battle. What does that mean? In our lives, we go to battle in the sense of we argue with people, we feel better than they are, we win for other people to lose. In other words, we like what we're doing by harming other people. So this is the Asuras. These are the four woeful states that we can often get into and all four of them have the quality of Dukkha, dissatisfaction. It's painful. Okay, so today what we have talked about is that the 12 steps of dependent origination actually collapse because things are happening more complicated than just still with step 1 through 12. That often things are kind of mixed. One example is that consciousness can be consciousness of the story that we're telling. So in that regard, we use consciousness in two different ways. One would be I-consciousness, and the other kind would be mind-consciousness. Now in philosophy, they almost always use the word consciousness as this Salyatana, this other kind of consciousness. But the Buddha makes sure that we are going to be using the consciousness as a word for any kind of input, the input that we have, which would be from the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the touch, and the mind. And so the consciousness grabs out in the mind and then it processes it again to come up with an embellishment or maybe a brand new story. And so this Paticcasamuppada is not a direct path, and you can see that there's a lot of mixture in there. Now Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of wisdom at the point of contact. In other words, if we are wise to the story If we can see the story that we're telling ourselves as a story, not as my story, not as the truth, not as what we think is right, we're not attached to it, but with wisdom we can see that it's merely a story. If we can see that, then we can begin to control the way we feel. In other words, you can feel the way you want to feel by merely telling yourself the right kind of story. If you want to feel like X, then tell a story about X. That story about X will contact you and you'll feel like X. This is the easy way to understand the teaching of the Buddha. Now we can also see that most people are given an example of a husband and wife are in an argument and that one of them goes too far in that argument. He recognized that he's gone too far in that argument, and so he'll leave and he'll slam the door on the way out. In other words, both husband and wife are already full-blown into Dukkha, but he woke up inside that Dukkha and left that Dukkha. He stormed out of the place, slammed the door, and went to cool off. So that means then that anyone can change, everybody can change. In fact, what would happen if the argument continued and they didn't stop arguing? Well, one of the possibilities is divorce, but another possibility is the knives and the guns come out and somebody gets shot or killed. Only then will then the remorse, or maybe, "Oh no, now I've got to go find a place to bury the body." So it is possible that someone does not wake up from an argument, but most people do. Most of us will stop the argument after we wake up. The question is, when can we wake up? Can we wake up when we're seeing we're in one of these woeful states? Can we wake up when we are seeing the clinging? Can we wake up during the time when Tanha is in effect? Can we wake up at the point of feeling? Bhikkhu Buddhadasa recommends that for people to start, the right place to start is at contact, to be able to see what we're doing that leads to feelings. But the Buddha, especially Sariputta, talks about it in another way, and that is that if we can begin to see the storytelling, then we can change the story while we're telling it. If we change the story at perception time, then the story will give wise feelings. Because we have wisdom at the point of perception. And if we are fast enough and wise enough to leave consciousness as merely consciousness and not tell a story about it, then that means that in that regard, no story winds up being no feeling at all, or the end of feeling. The end of the storytelling means the end of the story, which means now the end of feeling. And this end of feeling is not the same as that feeling that is small, not understood, has qualities of mixture, or both, has the quality of confusion. Now, when the perception stops, we can stop feeling altogether. Now, this can be done in first Jhana. It does not require that you spend all of those years sitting, going deep into meditation so that you can begin to see perception. You can just get quiet enough to start looking and start seeing how you make up stories. You can see that perception. Once you see it, you can begin to control it all on your own. So this is actually the teaching of the Buddha that is quite useful. Can you see what you're doing? Can you see your storytelling? If you can tell good stories, then the Samskaras will wind up having a lot of good stories in the Samskara, which means in the future when you begin to perceive stuff, you'll begin to perceive with better stories. And so it's an accumulative effect. It has a skill built into it, the skill of how fast are you. Are you fast enough to see yourself telling stories, or only fast enough to see the story you told? Are you fast enough to not start grasping and clinging, that you can leave it at the state of liking And in fact, there's that old story about Ajahn Samadhi and Ajahn Chah were at a festival, and Ajahn Chah asked Samadhi when there was a bunch of young Thai women all dressed up, and Ajahn Chah asked Samadhi about that, and he says, "I like it, but I don't want it." That means it directly. That we have a choice of feeling that we like it without going. In other words, I like the party but I don't want to go to it. I like the idea of a party but I don't want to go. So we can change at many different places, and the most, uh, deepest place that we can change would be at that place for perception. In other words, Samskara, you can't— you can make new Samskara, but you can't change the old one. But if you see the old one and you start to remorse, you can stop immediately that remorse. You can come right out of that hell immediately. And the way to do that is by telling a new story. And what would the new story be? 'Well, I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore.' 'Wow, I'm really glad that I'm here now. Things are really good right here. Why should I think about that old story?' So Ivan, you got your hand up, you got a question. Go right ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I thought it was interesting when you said it's not about improving or changing the old Samskara, just toss them out.

**Speaker A:** Immediately.

**Speaker B:** And with the wisdom to know that, hey, you know, you can build a new Samskara or something like that. I thought that was interesting because, yeah, it.

**Speaker A:** Is so— Yes, we can change if we can see what we're doing. If we can remember to look, we can see that that old painful feeling It's just an old painful feeling and you're okay right now. Well, isn't it great? I don't have to even think about that.

**Speaker B:** Time. Yeah, like, like, um, I really appreciate how the, the word abandoned, uh, has been used so much in the Pali, uh, language. Like, I'm also not abandoned, you know, like, oh, Sankhara abandoned. Like, I really like that. Like, Got straight to it.

**Speaker A:** Well, we can't abandon the senses. Who wants to go blind? I mean, if you had a choice, if I'm going to be an Arahant but I've got to stop being able to see, nobody's in for that. It's not the eye that we abandon, it's the storytelling that we abandon. It's not the Sankhara, it's not the past. We can't change that, but we can abandon our attachment to it by changing the stories that we tell ourselves about the past. So we can change that. In fact, there are four right efforts that we can apply at any of these points. When you're in that state of remorse, you can throw that remorse out by saying, oh, that's in the past, I don't need it anymore. I can stop cultivating that unwholesome thought and memory and cultivate a new story right here, right now. Wow, isn't it great? I don't have to do that anymore. Wow, I'm really happy right now. I don't have to remember those old bad things that.

**Speaker B:** Happened. I was thinking real quick, like, in a lot of modern psychology, they don't really use the word abandoned like this. It's almost like in a conventional term that sounds very extreme. But like in the Dharma, we do use that a lot. We don't use so.

**Speaker A:** Much, yeah, right? Well, we can abandon feelings, we can abandon our Tanha, we can even abandon the stories that we tell, but we don't want to abandon consciousness. We can't abandon Sankhara. There's no reason to abandon the body, but we can make changes to the way that we feel. So, Timo, what do you.

**Speaker C:** Think? Thank you. Always good to hear about Paticcasamuppada because for me it's complicated. Every time I hear it again, I feel like I get it a little bit more. It's always good. Always good. It's always fitting. It's always timely and so on.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Well, that's a better story you're making up now than the one you made up 30 seconds ago that is complicated. Do you recognize that that's just a story you made.

**Speaker C:** Up? Yeah, I guess.

**Speaker A:** I guess there's another story you could make up, and that's the story that I made up. This is the way the mind works. Can you see how your mind works? Because your mind is not complicated at all. It's just not.

**Speaker C:** Yours.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's, it's, it's the defilements that makes things complicated, right? Like degree of worship, devotion. Like when you have the developments there, then things start to complicate.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's complicated when you're telling yourself stories about it being complicated, but it becomes downright insightful when you can see.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** And that's what this talk is about, is can you see these various things? Stop telling yourselves the stories that I'm telling you and start seeing these things directly. That way it's not complicated at all. It's something that you're seeing directly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I can see stuff within that, but what makes it— what makes one tell the story about it being complicated is the fact that it's like these 12 things And I can't see all of that at once. For example, it makes more sense to me that we can see at the point of contact, we can investigate the story we are telling ourselves, we can see the relationship between the story and the feeling, but seeing all of that at once, all these links and the connections between all of them, it's like seeing 24 things at once. And that's then, that's for me, that's an overload. But I guess in this sense, Paticcasamuppada is also a concept and it's made.

**Speaker A:** Up. Okay. By the way, can I ask you, where do you live? Do you live in a.

**Speaker B:** City?

**Speaker C:** No, not anymore. No, I live in a small village.

**Speaker A:** A small village. How many people are in that village?

**Speaker C:** Not sure. Maybe 1,000. Maybe less. I don't.

**Speaker A:** Know. Wow, I bet things get really complicated there with 1,000 people.

**Speaker C:** Sometimes. I don't.

**Speaker A:** Know. The point I'm making is, is that don't look at it as complicated about the 1,000 people, but recognize that you can see one person at a time, one by one, as that person passes into your field of vision, is one by one as that person approaches you. You don't have to do the complexity of all 1,000 people in that town. The same thing is true about Paticcasamuppada. You do not have to try to gather all 12 steps in your mind at one time. In fact, we've already seen it is down to 9 now, and 5 of them are the aggregates, which makes it pretty simple. The question is, can you see them one at a time? Can you see when you like something that you like it? Can you see when you like it that you want it? Can you see that when you want it, you can go so far as I've got to have it? And there's that I that is created. This is the whole way of looking at it, is one at a time, one by one, as they.

**Speaker C:** Occur.

**Speaker A:** And then it's not complicated at all. It's, "Ha ha ha, I see.

**Speaker C:** You." Can I ask one more question? Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Go right ahead. I'm.

**Speaker C:** Listening. Well, I thought about the story. It seems to me that the story has all that stuff. Already built in. That's why it makes it a story that influences feeling. Because it seems that in the story, usually there is the self. There is the self with aversion to that is built into the Samskaras and wanting stuff and all that. For me, everything, for my understanding, everything collapses in there, and there I can see.

**Speaker A:** It. Yes, that's the important point, is even the story is not yours until you cling to it, until you make it my story. Before, it's just a story. It was just made up, made up by a.

**Speaker B:** Process.

**Speaker A:** So it's not my story, it's just a story until I cling to it because I like it or I hate it. And so everything, one by one as they occur, you can gain it by looking. One place to start looking is How do things contact you? How does your story contact you? Another place to look would be, how does that create a self? Where does my self come from? It comes from the Upadana, comes from the clinging. Then the best one is, can you begin to see that you're making shit up? The process of making shit up, that's the place to really begin to see it. I know that I like that. Begin to see that you're making shit up. That way you have a very good choice of making up shit you like. So Paul, what do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say? I can see that clinging to feelings, especially unpleasant feelings or mixed feelings, it takes a bit of right effort to shake it off and get back to practice. And also, I guess, keeping those wholesome thoughts going and maintaining that wholesome mind state in a way helps to keep guard at the point of contact.

**Speaker A:** Right. And that's an important point, that if you are having wholesome thoughts, guess what? The story that you make up then is going to be much more likely wholesome, a wholesome story you're making up with each of these thoughts. Very good. So, Dan, what do you.

**Speaker C:** Think? Can't hear you.

**Speaker A:** I can see your microphone on and your lips moving, but I don't I hear you.

**Speaker B:** I think it's a distal microphone.

**Speaker C:** Setting.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Now I don't see your lips.

**Speaker D:** Moving.

**Speaker A:** All right. Let's move on. What about you, Amrit? What do you.

**Speaker E:** Think? Yeah, definitely. So this, this, this, uh, the story, story part is very kind of, um, I mean, on the one hand, it's also you feel also a bit stupid. That in the past you were just telling yourself story and reacting to your own story. But this is also kind of a very easy way out. Just keep telling yourself good stories and then you are making your own destiny.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Those old habits begin to change, and as you change your habits, your destiny will change.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** The destiny is not fixed because there's no fixed self. If there was a soul, then that soul would have a destiny. But really, the destiny is all from our habits, not from the soul. And we can change our habits by changing one thought at a time, one feeling at a time, one mental attitude at a time. We can change That story, because that's what destiny really is, is just a story, a long story we tell.

**Speaker C:** Ourselves.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, in the past, I remember whenever I would wake up in the morning and then I would review, kind of, this was an automatic habit. I would review the last day and I would be upset, all the things I planned to do and I didn't.

**Speaker C:** Do.

**Speaker A:** And all you have to do is say, wow, today is a new day and I don't have to worry about yesterday at all.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and I used to think this was like a good habit because then I thought, okay, I would be doing more things today, but it just goes in the same cycle. But now I wake up and I realize automatically I'm kind of having wholesome thoughts. And it's just a new habit now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's a better habit, isn't it? Okay, Garantha, good to see you, my friend. Been a while.

**Speaker B:** It has. Good to see you too.

**Speaker A:** Can you— am I— do you have anything to say about today's.

**Speaker B:** Talk?

**Speaker A:** Thank you very much. It's a practice for me as well to consistently remember and to have wholesome.

**Speaker C:** Thoughts.

**Speaker A:** So it's been good. Very good. So Yanis, what do you.

**Speaker C:** Think? How do you make new stories if every time you pick up is Samskara, it's like coming from the past? How do you make new good shit.

**Speaker A:** Up? With right noble effort to remember that you can make up any stories that you want to make up, or not at all. Rather than making up the old stories that you're in the habit of making up, make up some new ones. Make up the story, wow, everything is really nice right now, everything is wonderful, not a problem in the world, everything is okay, all my friends are here and everybody's.

**Speaker C:** Happy. Yeah, that's a good one, but for me it's not new because it's coming from you. It's old in that sense. It's good, but it's still like taken from memory.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, remember then to have happy wholesome thoughts. Put that in your memory so that's the first thing that comes.

**Speaker C:** Out. Okay, thank.

**Speaker A:** You. So, Amal, what do you have to.

**Speaker F:** Say? It was really interesting to learn about the four woeful states. Can see very frequently at work going into the dumb animal state. Clinging state. Also, it's good to see the Paticcasamuppada as a framework to understand how the mind is working and can see that the different parts of Paticcasamuppada, those are interlinked. They are not serially working. And can break it at any point, any of those points. It can break it at the clinging or at any of the stages. Just what we have to do is to pay wise attention and to change the story that we are telling.

**Speaker A:** Ourselves.

**Speaker F:** I can see that a lot of times, once you are in a state of clinging, mind can bring up a lot of old Samskaras, can bring up a lot of old data to support, to keep clinging on, and can break it there, can pay wise attention and change. Also, I have seen that it becomes easier, the link, the hold that those thoughts those old things have, it reduces every time if we are breaking it this time and changing the pathway.

**Speaker A:** Easier to break it again next time. That's true. That's also called skill development. So congratulations that you're developing skills to be able to see how your mind works. Works so that you can change it. Okay, so Z, what do you have to say? So Dan, did you get your microphone straightened out? Not sure. Yeah, there you go.

**Speaker G:** Ah, okay. So, um, one thing I don't have an understanding of, the contact. I don't know, have no picture what the contact is and didn't understand it. And, um, I wondered, because the neutral Vedana, um, didn't get a good, um, didn't sound so, uh, appealing in your description. So I wonder, is there a good Vedana that you would fight for?

**Speaker A:** The Vedana that you could call good, I would call wise. Wise Vedana. Wise Vedana would be, I like it, but I don't want.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker G:** So can you say a sentence or two about contact? What is the contact?

**Speaker A:** Well, the contact is that once you tell yourself a story, that story contacts you. The input, the sight that you saw, is not what contacts you. It's the story that you told about what you contacted.

**Speaker G:** With the eye, only stories like inner thoughts that contact, not, not— yeah, that.

**Speaker A:** Inner story, that inner consciousness is what contacts our feelings, right? In other words, I saw her and then I felt like shit. Well, it wasn't the sight of her that I felt like shit. It's the story that I told after I saw her that made me feel like shit. Like she dumped me, and that's my story. She dumped me, therefore I feel like shit. But the story didn't happen until the 'I' started the perception up, and the perception then grabbed the old story and told a new story that she hates me. Right? And that story that I'm telling myself now is what contacts you now. Not that I saw her, because I could see her and then tell myself a different story. Oh, I remember her. Wow, she was really nice to me. And then we don't feel bad when we tell that.

**Speaker G:** Story. Contact appears every moment. There's one contact.

**Speaker A:** That's right. This stuff happens really fast. The mind is fast, oh monks. The Buddha says that the mind is so fast he doesn't even have an analogy for how fast it is. It goes like that, which means now that our Sati needs to develop the skill of being fast so that we can see this stuff.

**Speaker B:** On the.

**Speaker A:** Fly. And the way to get it fast is by investigating, continuing to look, continue to investigate. And so now let's try Z again. Z, are you there? So what do you have to say, Mikey? Can you help me with what he.

**Speaker D:** Said? I did not hear.

**Speaker C:** Anything.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, does anybody have any last words to.

**Speaker B:** Say? Dhammarato, just one last thing. I see that the fabrication also happened before the contact, right? Like, I could almost say that shit is already being made up. And the contact just.

**Speaker A:** Amplified it. Yeah, the fabrication, that's just another word for the Samskara. It's the old stuff. It could have happened a tenth of a second ago, but it's already old.

**Speaker B:** Right. Because I was not paying attention, the Samskara was already being built. Uh, you know, when the context being made, then I make it more shit up. So yeah, that's the way I see.

**Speaker A:** It. Okay, will you begin to see that you're making shit up? Start playing with the story.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you've got options here. All right. Well, Mikey, would you take this thing and shove.

**Speaker D:** It?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Thank you for this splendid Dharma talk today. And thanks, friends, for being here. There's no need to leave.

### Summary

Here is a summary of the Dhamma talk by Dhammarato on Dependent Origination (*Paticcasamuppāda*):

### **Core Theme**
The talk explains Dependent Origination not as a rigid 12-step sequence, but as a dynamic, practical map of how the mind creates suffering—and how we can interrupt that process with mindfulness and wisdom.

### **Key Points**

1. **Purpose of Studying Dependent Origination:**
   - To understand how the mind works.
   - To identify unwholesome mental states and change them through Right Effort.

2. **It’s Not Just 12 Linear Steps:**
   - The standard 12 links are often presented too sequentially. In reality, the process is fluid and can be understood in a simplified, collapsed form (e.g., 9 steps).
   - The mind operates very quickly; the faster our mindfulness (*sati*), the sooner we can see and change the process.

3. **The Process Simplified:**
   - **Ignorance** → **Formations (Saṅkhāra)**: We are born ignorant, and through life we accumulate habits, memories, and mental formations. Saṅkhāra is like a disorganized pile of books—frequent habits are like many copies of the same book, easily grabbed.
   - **Consciousness (Viññāṇa)** → **Mind & Body (Nāmarūpa)** → **Six Sense Bases (Saḷāyatana)**: Sensory input is processed using past saṅkhāra. We perceive by “naming” (*nāma*) what we see (*rūpa*), essentially **telling ourselves a story** about experience.
   - **Contact (Phassa)** → **Feeling (Vedanā)**: Contact is not with the raw sense data, but with the **story we tell** about it. This contact gives rise to feeling: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral/confused.
   - **Craving (Taṇhā)**: Feeling leads to craving: “I like it, I want it” (*kāmataṇhā*), “I want to become/have this” (*bhavataṇhā*), or “I don’t like it, I want to get rid of it” (*vibhavataṇhā*).
   - **Clinging (Upādāna)** → **Becoming (Bhava)** → **Birth (Jāti)** → **Suffering (Dukkha)**: Craving intensifies into clinging, which **gives birth to the sense of “self”** (the “I” that wants or hates). This “birth” of self is accompanied by suffering.

4. **The Five Aggregates & Not-Self (Anattā):**
   - The process involves the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness). There is **no permanent self** in any of them.
   - The sense of “I” is a temporary creation that arises with clinging. Industries like fashion, cosmetics, and fitness exploit our mistaken identification with the body (“I am beautiful/ugly”).

5. **Where Wisdom Can Intervene (The “Exit Points”):**
   - The key teaching: **we can break the chain at multiple points** with wise attention:
     - **At Contact:** See the story you’re telling yourself. Realize it’s just a story, not reality.
     - **At Feeling:** Recognize a feeling as merely pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—without personalizing it.
     - **At Craving:** Notice wanting or aversion arising and choose not to follow it (e.g., “I like it, but I don’t want it”).
     - **At Clinging:** See the “self” being created and let go.
   - The **earliest and most powerful point** is at **Perception (the storytelling stage)**. Change the story, change the feeling.

6. **The Four Woeful States (Examples of Clinging/Suffering):**
   - **Hungry Ghost (Peta):** Insatiable wanting (never enough).
   - **Hell (Niraya):** Experiencing intense heat/anger, remorse, or pain.
   - **Dumb Animal (Tiracchāna):** Ignorantly doing what you dislike, feeling trapped (like a draft horse plowing its own pasture).
   - **Titan/Asura:** Competitive, jealous, or feeling inferior/afraid to engage.

7. **Practical Training:**
   - **Develop the skill of speed** in mindfulness to catch the process.
   - **Abandon unwholesome stories** by replacing them with wholesome ones (e.g., instead of ruminating on past guilt, think, “I’m glad I don’t do that anymore”).
   - **Build new, wholesome saṅkhāra** by repeatedly choosing skillful thoughts and stories. This gradually overwrites old habits.
   - The practice is **observing one link at a time** as it happens, not intellectually analyzing all 12 at once.

### **Conclusion**
Dependent Origination is a practical tool for deconstructing suffering in real time. By seeing how we unconsciously create stories that lead to craving and a sense of self, we can use wisdom to tell different stories—or stop storytelling altogether—leading to peace and the end of suffering. The path is about **seeing, not complicating**. As Dhammarato emphasized: **“Can you see that you’re making shit up? Start playing with the story.”**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the complex concept of Dependent Origination (*Paticcasamuppada*) and how the mind works. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **The Library Pile (for *Saṅkhāra*):**
    *   **Metaphor:** *Saṅkhāra* (mental formations, habits, memories) is compared to a disorganized library where all the books are piled in the middle of the floor instead of being neatly shelved.
    *   **Purpose:** This illustrates how past experiences, habits, and memories are not orderly but exist as a tangled heap. Frequently repeated thoughts or habits are like having thousands of copies of one book in that pile, making it much more likely you'll "pick up" (think or act from) that pattern again. Building new, wholesome habits is like adding many copies of a new book to the top of the pile, burying the old, unwholesome ones.

2.  **The Party (for the Three Kinds of *Taṇhā*/Craving):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The three types of craving (*Taṇhā*) are explained using a New Year's Eve party:
        *   **Wanting to go to the party:** *Bhava-taṇhā* (craving for becoming).
        *   **Being at the party and wanting things (food, drink, attention):** *Kāma-taṇhā* (craving for sensual pleasure).
        *   **Wanting to leave the party:** *Vibhava-taṇhā* (craving for non-becoming/annihilation).
    *   **Purpose:** This provides a relatable, sequential scenario to map the abstract Pali terms for craving onto a familiar human experience, showing how craving shifts based on our relationship to an experience.

3.  **The Storyteller (for Perception & *Saḷāyatana*):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind's process of perception (*nāmarūpa*) and the sixth sense base (*saḷāyatana*, mind-consciousness) is described as **storytelling**. We don't just see raw data; we instantly "make up a story" about what we see by pulling bits from our "library pile" (*saṅkhāra*).
    *   **Purpose:** This is the central, repeated metaphor. It demystifies perception, framing it as an active, often unconscious, process of fabrication. It empowers the listener by suggesting that if we see we are "making shit up," we can learn to "tell better stories" that lead to less suffering.

4.  **The Two Observers and the Nun (for Contact - *Phassa*):**
    *   **Story:** Two people see a nun across the street. One, a devout student, feels reverence. The other, who was beaten by nuns in school, feels aversion.
    *   **Purpose:** This story clearly illustrates that **contact (*phassa*)** is not with the raw sense object (the nun), but with the **mental story** we create about it. The feeling arises from the story, not the thing itself. This highlights the subjective and constructed nature of experience.

5.  **The Horse and the Plow (for the "Dumb Animal" Woeful State):**
    *   **Story:** A horse lives happily in a pasture. A new owner arrives, harnesses it, and makes it plow that very pasture to plant crops the horse won't eat.
    *   **Purpose:** This vividly depicts the "dumb animal" realm—a state of ignorant, compelled labor where one feels trapped, doing unpleasant work without enjoying the fruits. The speaker links this to modern jobs, suggesting the way out is not to quit the activity but to "stop the not liking"—to change one's relationship to the work.

### **Key Stories & Analogies:**

*   **The Person Who Never Saw a Tree:** Used to explain how perception relies on past *saṅkhāra*. Without a prior concept ("tree"), one cannot recognize or name what they see.
*   **The Husband/Wife Argument:** Used to show that awakening (and ending the cycle) can happen even in the midst of strong *dukkha* (suffering). One person "wakes up," stops arguing, and leaves to cool off, preventing a worse outcome (divorce, violence).
*   **Ajahn Chah and the Young Women:** The anecdote where Ajahn Chah says, "I like it, but I don't want it," is used to illustrate the possibility of experiencing a pleasant feeling (*vedanā*) without letting it turn into craving (*taṇhā*) or clinging (*upādāna*).
*   **The Four Woeful States (*Apāya*):** The speaker doesn't just list them but **characterizes them as psychological states we enter daily**:
    *   **Hungry Ghost (*Peta*):** The state of insatiable wanting (e.g., Jay Leno with cars, Bezos with money—"never enough").
    *   **Hell (*Niraya*):** The state of burning remorse or hot anger.
    *   **Animal (*Tirachāna*):** The state of ignorant, compelled labor (the "dumb animal" plowing its own pasture).
    *   **Titans/Asuras:** The state of competitive battle (needing others to lose for you to win) or fearful hesitation (the "wallflower" at the party).
*   **The Software Engineer and the Syntax Error:** A modern example of the "dumb animal" state. The engineer feels frustration (hell/animal state) upon seeing an error. The wise alternative is to get up, walk away, and return when they can address it with a clear, pleasant mind.

### **Overall Narrative Metaphor:**
The entire talk is framed as a **practical guide to reverse-engineering your own mind**. The metaphors and stories are tools to help the listener "see the machinery" of perception, feeling, and craving in real-time, with the ultimate goal of learning to "change the story" and thus change their suffering. The shift from a rigid "12-step sequence" to a more fluid "9-step" or "aggregate-based" model is itself a story about making the teaching less complicated and more directly observable.
