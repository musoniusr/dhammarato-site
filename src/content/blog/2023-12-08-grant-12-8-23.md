### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say, is messaging you first or call— or just calling the best way to get in touch first?

**Speaker A:** Well, if you message me and you don't get a response for a while, that means that I didn't get the message.

**Speaker B:** Arya, that's what I thought. Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but if you call, I'll hear it and then I can do something about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no worries.

**Speaker A:** All good. So what's your question?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I've been practicing for quite a while with meditation, and I've managed to increase my number of sessions per day because I found that, especially after hearing you talk about Anapanasati and the and that sort of attitude of joy and accomplishment. And I sort of realized that I wasn't doing enough regular practice to top me up, to really feel like I was making progress.

**Speaker A:** So, well, I hope you stop trying to make progress.

**Speaker B:** I know that. Well, yeah, I was. It's not so much progress. It was like I realized that the post-meditation sessions, the benefit I was getting from the sessions wasn't lasting well. Like, the good thing I was getting from the sessions wasn't maintaining in between sessions. So since I've upped the number of sessions, I'm in a much more even with my awareness and mindfulness in between sessions, which is good. It feels really good. And the other thing about it was just motivation to practice was wavering with me. And the big thing I've taken away from hearing you talk about this is the importance of noticing the joy, noticing the accomplishment, that sense of achievement and that positivity, because that's certainly something that had kind of gone a bit stale with me. And I've— so increasing the sessions, having more sense of getting into that good state, which I can do. I mean, I've been doing it for a long time. I can do it fairly easily if I do it. But also then goes, then sort of celebrating that and go, yeah, that's it, that's great. That little bit of extra energy has seemed to really broken me out of a bit of a slump, which is Great. I'm really pleased with that. Um, so I guess, yeah, so, um, that's the main change I've made is to have a look for that joy, look for that, um, restful and happy state, which I get a lot when I practice anyway. Um, but it seems like— is there.

**Speaker A:** A question in there someplace?

**Speaker B:** So I'm just asking Do I need to? Because that idea of Piti, you know, that Piti state, or that very focused state with that huge sense of feeling behind it. My mood state in practice is generally calm, content. But I wouldn't say, I don't know how I would describe it. It's not a really high kind of emotional state as far as feeling amazing or anything. It's more gentle, calm, settled. And focus.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what's wrong with that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that's why I'm happy with that. I get that's all I'm really doing is a minor course correction is by checking in with you and going, yeah, I can keep doing it. Um, the other thing that's happening is I'm getting a lot of happy memories from childhood and a lot of blissful kind of memories coming through, which I think is part of me. Because the main thing that's been my barrier is I experience a lot of anxiety in general. I've got a high lot of anxiety. And so I wasn't really being able to function well with the anxiety in between sessions until I ramped up the number of sessions. And that seems to have made a difference.

**Speaker A:** Well, that makes sense, doesn't it? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it does. Yeah. I'd been trying a lot of other tools like psychological tools and various, you know, therapy tools and that to manage it. And I was kind of feeling a little bit down that the practice wasn't helping as much as I hoped it would. But since I've done the increase, it's good. Yeah, I guess that's it, Dhammarato. I just wanted to check about that because I'm not like 100% familiar yet with the idea of Vajrayana, but I think because I've been practicing for a while, I'm probably already experiencing a lot of it and just don't know that that's it, if you know what I mean. Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, based upon what normally happens And what normally happens is what I would call Western Buddhism, which is, let us say, the new kid on the block and the one that's furthest away from the actual teachings of the Buddha. And so the thing that we can do here is to reestablish what the actual teachings of the Buddha actually are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that the first thing is that the issue of seclusion, that the Buddha recommends to go to the forest, to a foot of a tree, to an empty hut, or to a pile of straw, and sit down and bring Sati right here now. It translated to mindfulness to the fore. But it actually means right now. And nowhere in there is there anything about formal sitting practice, which is all the rage nowadays. All right, and there's a lot of reasons why that would be there. Some of it comes from Burma And some of it comes from, let us call them, Buddha rupas, or statues of the Buddha, which came many centuries, by the way, after the Buddha. In the time of the Buddha, the thing that represented Buddhism was three things. One was a tree, the other one was the Bodhi leaf, and the third one is the Dhamma chakra. And the Dhamma Chakra either has 8 or 12 wheels depending upon the point. The 8-pointed wheel would be the Eightfold Noble Path, and the 12-pointed wheel or spoked wheel would be for the Piti Samuppada. But back to the Buddha Rupa and what we now call, in fact I was almost waiting for you with anticipation, that you would use the word formal, because the Buddha did not recommend or give a formal practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that people see the sitting on the floor as part of the formal practice, to where the reality is sitting on the floor was what everybody did. They still do it in India, they still do it in Thailand. They sit on the floor to eat here in Thailand. So sitting on the floor, that in fact at the Chicago Wat, in I think it's Wat Dhammarato, they bought an old Baptist church property. And for years there was a debate about whether they were going to take the pews out of the sanctuary so that they could have a bare floor. And a lot of people voted, yeah, let's take them things out because we don't need pews, we can sit on the floor. And a lot of people say Hey, there are people who can't sit on the floor in the West, and the reason for that was basically because we were yanked off the floor when we were 3 years old or 2 years old and put into a high chair, and then we sit at desk and all that. And so the sitting on the floor is not part of the practice, actually, but the Buddha does talk about all four postures. In the sense of standing, walking, lying, and sitting, whether you're sitting in a chair or on the floor. So this is the whole point about the formal practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm just getting a bit of paper. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. The whole point about the formal practice is, is that that actually prevents people from actually practicing what needs to be practiced. And what needs to be practiced in the sense of that bringing mindfulness to the fore is to know what you're thinking when you're thinking it. Yeah, to remember to look at what we're doing. So in the actual practicing is, is that we, we remember that thoughts of the past, thoughts of childhood, are not actually part of the practice. We have thoughts of childhood when we're not practicing, and that's okay. We're not practicing all the time. But when we are practicing, we're practicing in this present moment, what's happening right here, right now, and bringing in the Eightfold Noble Path We talk about various parts of it. I don't want this discussion today to be a full-on Eightfold Noble Path talk, but rather more of how to practice. Now, in the Eightfold Noble Path, it is listed in two different ways. One is Sila, Samadhi, Panna. You've probably heard those three words before. Sila, Samadhi, Panna.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm reading that right at the moment in the Seeing with the Eye of Dharma book by Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Now, there are two levels or two methods of practice. The Sila, Samatha, Pañña, which means that it winds up in Pañña, is actually the starting point for the Noble Path. We start with Pañña, Sila, Pañña, Samatha, Sila. We wind up with good behavior. So in the normal ordinary world where people start, we start by trying to behave ourselves. But here we start with Sila only in the sense of getting away from other people, literally getting away from other people, and mentally getting away from other people to get into seclusion. And that's all the Sila that we need. If you're not thinking about anybody and you're not seeing anybody, it's really hard to hurt them, to kill them, to rob them, to lie to them because they're not in the mind, right? Okay, so we actually— what we're doing is we're starting with wisdom, or Pañña, and in that regard, we remember to be in this present moment. And what really the Pañña is, is the investigation. Now, you probably heard about the term right noble view. A right noble view is not a viewpoint, it's not a worldview, it's not a way of looking at things. Rather, it is actually an investigation, investigating right now what the mind, what the body, what the feelings, what the environment is doing right this very moment. Okay, and this is how we practice, and that we remember then to look and see what we're doing right here, right now, or what we're thinking, or what we're feeling, etc. And then make a change. The third aspect of the Eightfold Noble Path, as specified in Majjhima Nikaya number 117, the Great Forty, has these three things in that order. That right view comes first, but we have to remember to right view, to look, and then right noble effort is to make a change. Now, in the sutta, it actually talks about seeing unwholesome thoughts as unwholesome thoughts and to change them to wholesome thoughts. And the easy way to understand unwholesome thoughts would be if you're thinking about someplace else, if you're thinking about something you're not doing, like working, if you are not in the present moment, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about somewhere else, thinking about something else, that would be considered in this practice unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** So I just want to clarify, when the memories are coming up, it's often associated with the feeling of joy that I'm having, but I'm pretty familiar with not grabbing onto those thoughts and just staying back in the present moment. So you're saying that's important even though the thoughts might be very joyful ones about the past?

**Speaker A:** I need to Think about the joyfulness right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly, exactly, which is what I'm doing. So that's great. So I'm managing to— I've got a pretty good ability to stay with that. Once I turn my mind to it, I can do it. I just need to be confident that's what I should do. Great. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right. So this is the right noble effort. Now, there are several places where the right noble effort is referred, one of the ways to refer to right noble effort in the sense of unwholesome thoughts would be hindrances. You've no doubt heard about Panchanirvana, or the five hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right.

**Speaker A:** So if you want something, if you don't like something, if you're worried, if you're thinking about something, if there's doubt about the practice and all of that kind of stuff, that's actually going to hinder you. Those are unwholesome thoughts. Okay, so if we can then come and have wholesome thoughts, what would be some examples of wholesome thoughts? Would be, wow, this feels good. Wow, this is nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No place to go and nothing to do, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself is Japanese haiku. Yeah, okay. So.

**Speaker B:** These are the kinds that I'm missing. That's the bit I was missing, which I'm now using much more often, and that is kind of like adding a huge amount of fuel to my practice now. So yeah, great, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, to reference, uh, there was a, um, a man who died, or a monk who died in 1982. His name was Mahasi Sayadaw. And there is a strange, wrong practice that has been given his name, like the Mahasi Method. And one of the characteristics of the Mahasi Method is that it does not do the Right Noble Effort. Then what they're doing, they talk about, is investigating the reality of the hindrances, investigating the Dukkha. But here, based upon the suttas and also based upon much stuff that I've gotten from Arahant Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, Achan Po, and other noble monks that I have known, we do not need to investigate the Dukkha. We need to avoid it. And so the recent story that I've been telling is imagine that you were walking down the street on the sidewalk, let us say, even in front of your house, and you find a dog turd right in your path. If you're a Mahasi Method practitioner, you're going to pick that dog turd up, take it into the kitchen and dissect it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** If you're practicing correctly, you're going to just avoid it. Just get out of the way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you're practicing the Vajrayana method of choiceless awareness, you step right in that dog turd and then go clean it off your feet sometime. Right. But the real point of right noble effort is to get out of that right now. Yeah. So if you're thinking about the past, even in childhood, You can say, wow, I feel good right now too. Now, I've also told people that it's all right to go reminisce upon the past if you're having trouble finding joy. But once you find it, eliminate the source and experience that joy, that good feeling right here, right now. Now, the word joy, we need to actually define. Okay, let's define that. Actually, the word that in the Pali would be the word Sukkha. Now, the actual word Sukkha is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha. Why? Because Sukkha actually has the quality of being satisfied, being in a state of satisfaction. Everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Are all words that we would say when we're satisfied that this is okay. Yeah, it's acceptable. Like, you take delivery of something that you've ordered and you say, yeah, I'll sign for it, I'll take this, it's good enough. As opposed to taking it to the complaint department, which is normally what we do with our lives, is we take it to the complaint department— sometimes that place is in heaven— and we take all of our worries and try to get somebody up there to fix it. But here we're changing that attitude from things are broken and need to be fixed into things are already right this very moment, right now is okay. Well, if we can be in that particular place, there is no need to become enlightened. A lot of people are looking for something special. And they go to the complaint department and say, "I ain't special yet, make me special." But really, the practice that the Buddha recommends is to come out of the Dukkha. That's the only teaching that he says, is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And yet the Mahasi method, for instance, is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, let me see that Dukkha, let me dissect that Dukkha, see that that Dukkha is related to this Dukkha over here, and oh, that Dukkha comes out of my past and, oh, I had a miserable childhood. Yeah. And we wind up going down the Dukkha rat hole, perhaps far enough that some of the Mahayana teachers talk about a dark night of the soul. The Buddha didn't talk about a dark night of the soul. He talked about coming out of that stuff right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** And so we're enlightened right here, right now. If we are feeling good, we have the Sukkha. That's it. That's all there really is to it. Now let's define Sukkha in detail out of the— let us call it out of the Pali dictionary. One of the qualities is that we feel safe and secure. Now, you did actually mention anxiety. So if you have the feeling of anxiety, you don't even possibly— it's possible you don't even know the source of it.

**Speaker B:** But the way to get out of it, it's physiological. It's mainly physiological, and I've got a lot of strategies to get out of it. But it's certainly the thing you're saying about safe and security is a really helpful strategy, and it actually is working.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So you can actually tell yourself everything is all right now. There's no worries. There's nothing. There's no reason to feel this anxiety. And so we could use the Anapanasati part of that to begin to breathe it out, to take a long, deep breath and to breathe it out, play with it, move around that anxiety, identify it, experience it. In the realm of letting it go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is to not have anxiety.

**Speaker B:** That's right. And my breathing pattern— I've worked with breathing patterns a lot— my breathing pattern has now changed. I've noticed a different breathing pattern from doing this practice in this way and for longer. So my anxiety levels have dropped down hugely since I've made that correction of my practice. So that's great. I'm on the right track. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. And we can actually, in this realm, let's look at it as black and white. I know that there's degrees, there's intensities, there's durations and all of that kind of stuff. But we can say that while we're practicing, we can see that anxiety and throw it out. So we're looking at it's gone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now, there's a lot of stuff. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I say the positivity is the thing that's added so much fuel to the fire. It's like it's taken the handbrake off and my mind can actually work the way it wants to work to deal with the anxiety because I'm looking at the Sukkha rather than the Dukkha. And that's been the key thing that's made the difference rather than focusing on the power pole that the car is heading towards. I'm focusing on the road where I want to be going. You know what I mean? I'm getting back on the road rather than getting stuck in the inside.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Okay. Now, as far as traveling, then we can use that as a bit of an analogy. All right. Let us say that we're in the car and we have— we're heading west and we've left Oklahoma City and we're going to California. All we really need to do is to keep our eye on the road right in front of us. All right, when the monks go out to Bundabot, the instruction is to watch where you're going. Notice your footfall, see where you are. You only need to look about 10 to 20 feet in front of you, just enough to see, is there a snake in the road? Is it gravel? Is there a mud puddle? And don't step on that kind of stuff. Find an easy way to practice, but we're not lollygagging. We're not looking at rubbernecking of accidents, we're not looking at the daughter of the woman who's trying to feed us; we just keep the eyes on the path, or in the bowl. This is also what they call guarding the senses. Just look at what's immediately in front of us, let us say up to about 5 or 10 seconds ahead. And if you're sitting, there's really no place to look other than, "This is nice, this is good enough, this is the quality we're looking for." Now, we can also mention to ourselves little things like, especially those who have a lot of anxiety, we can have little things to say like, "Guess what? There is no Russian Mafia at the door." There is no SWAT team, there are no snakes on the floor, there is no problem right now. Wow, what a relief it is! I got no worries, no problems, and we can begin to feel safe and secure, basically because we talked ourselves into it, even to the point of singing ourselves a lullaby. Everything is all right, everything is fine. 'Let's just be easygoing, easy peasy, hunky-dory.' This is the way that we practice, is by having those kind of wholesome little thoughts that intend to gladden the mind. Now, the words that we're saying are just words, but they have the quality or the intention of changing the mind state that we're in. Now humans are born as little babies, we're dependent and we're vulnerable. And what the whole practice of Anapanasati is all about is to come out of our vulnerable position into becoming a champion. The Buddha was known as a lion, so this is what we're looking for, is I feel good, I know I feel good, There is nothing that can pull me out of my feeling good right now.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now what I'm talking about. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I'm also celebrating each in-breath and out-breath with my focus isn't so good on a bad day. And I'm finding that really helpful as far as looking at that. I'm fine right here, right now. There's one in-breath. There's one out-breath. Hooray.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Exactly. Celebration.

**Speaker B:** That's very good if I'm having a scattered day, because as you know, the weather comes and goes in the mind, but that always brings me back down again quite quickly. So yeah, that's been really helpful.

**Speaker A:** Right. So the celebration then has the quality of being okay, has the quality of no problems, no worries. It has the quality of not being a victim to my past and my future. Now, as we continue to practice this, we begin to gain confidence that we can do this. We add the confidence. The word in Pali is Saddha, or in Sanskrit is Shraddha, and that it is absolutely wrongly translated as faith. Why? Because faith has no evidence. But confidence has evidence: I won that goal, I got rid of that anxiety, I am free now. So it has that quality of confidence, and as the confidence grows, we begin to take on the quality of the attitude changes from the attitude of a victim— oh, poor me, I need to meditate— and the hot diggity dog, I've got this wired. Yeah, this is actually the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path, and the name of it is Samma Sanghappa, the confidence, the feeling like that you're in charge, that you're the lion here, you're the boss of your life right this very minute. Not forever, but for right this very minute. We've got this, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's been really helpful to keep remembering that. I feel like I'm already at the base camp. You talked about climbing the mountain and making a base camp at one point, and I feel like my base camp is actually pretty solid, but I just have to enjoy the fact that I'm actually got— I'm at the base camp. It's, it's fine.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, that's where it is. This is, this is the base camp, and going to the peak then is the Sukkha becomes momentarily Piti. And the Piti is a sense of, wow, this is great. Like, wow, this is really good. It's momentary. We don't stay on the mountaintop, but we do have that thought of, got this. Wow, this is so nice. This is really, really great. And when we have that exuberance, it can give us cold chills, it could give us goosebumps, to feel like, "I've got this!" And we need to continue to repeat that on a regular basis, but we don't maintain it, we just check it out, get there, and then come back down to a base of Sukkha. Yeah, and this is all in the Anapanasati Sutta.

**Speaker B:** Great. And I think that base camp for me is a place I'm really starting to enjoy and celebrate more because I've actually, you know, I was there and I didn't know it, if you know what I mean. I was already at that point. Can I just ask one other quick question about strategies for days when the mind wanders more? I use eye gaze. Can you just tell me reflect a little bit on eye gaze. I practice with eyes closed, half open, wider open, and I use that to help sort of pick up my mind when it's either getting overexcited or sluggish. Is there any traps with you changing my gaze like that during the practice to settle?

**Speaker A:** I would say offhand no, other than become aware of what you're doing. In that regard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's all very consciously done. I'm not just— yeah, it's, it's adjust the mind slightly when things are either overexcited and too much going on or getting sleepy and drowsy. So I've learned over the years to gently move my gaze and change the— change it, and that lifts me, as well as minor postural changes. So yeah, I don't think there's any problems there, but I just— it's something I do quite often to adjust the mind on a particular moment. Yep.

**Speaker A:** All right. Here's something that you can adjust. And that has to do with the attitude. Like, for instance, when the mind wanders away, when it wanders away into things that create anxiety or doubt or worry or any of that kind of stuff, the trick I will give you is the little phrase, I can do better than this.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I see you, Mara, is the term that the Buddha used. Aha, I see that. And with that, we can say, I can do better than that. Never mind, start again would be the way that Gowanka would say it. All right, we can change that. We can see those hindrances, even if they keep coming back. When you say, got you again, I see that again. I see it again. Aha, I caught you. All right. And so the attitude is, is that we're playing cat and mouse, that that is an interesting game that we're playing, as opposed to this is really important. Because it's not. When it becomes really important, then when we fail at it, we feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I screwed that up. And the answer is, aha, no, I caught it again, I see it again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if we can't laugh about it, we're in trouble. If we— if I can't see my patterns and, and not take them seriously, uh, and think they're really important when I screw up, then yeah, that's a real problem. I'm making a problem out of a problem, basically.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, the way to talk about it also is to nurture ourselves rather than being critical. That everything you do is okay so long as you see it and you have a choice to stop it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a choice point. Good.

**Speaker A:** As opposed to being swallowed whole by it. And that's the attitude change again. So when you find yourself being critical of yourself, saying, aha, I see that criticism, and then come back into a nurturing mentality— everything's okay, everything is fine, lullaby and good night, I've got a great big smile on now. Okay, that's the way to do it, is to have a big smile and of joy, of satisfaction. Okay, now another quality of Sukkha is the quality of comfort. So we should practice with our body in a comfortable posture. I know that when people in Western practice see the Asians, they get themselves into uncomfortable postures. And then their knees hurt or their back hurts.

**Speaker B:** After many years of practice, one of my knees isn't so good, so I'm very gentle with it now. Chairs are fine. Yeah, I'm not sitting cross-legged nearly as much. I don't have to. It's not necessary.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not necessary. What's necessary instead is to becoming comfortable. Why the Western meditation crowd misses that point, I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there are some practices you're forbidden from moving, and just whatever sensations you have, you just sit with them. And I think that's really dangerous and unhelpful. But there are some instructors that talk about, you know, don't move, don't scratch, don't do anything.

**Speaker A:** Right, but that's for— that's not for the beginner. And we can stay in the position of beginners always, not accomplished So always stay with being comfortable, because it's really hard to feel comfortable when the body is giving you information that is not comfortable.

**Speaker B:** One of the main sensations I get after longer sessions when things are very calm and settled is I do get pins and needles in one leg, and it sort of goes to sleep. Um, yeah, that's what I do. That's what I do.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Don't sit there and say pins and needles, pins and needles, or ants are crawling, ants are crawling, or anything like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right. I'm aware of pins and needles. That's not the way to do it.

**Speaker A:** But rather get the body back into a state of comfort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's easy when you do it. You do it quickly, no fuss, and you're back into it again. Yeah, good, good.

**Speaker A:** And we can, we can see the Sutta evidence from that directly when he's talking about step 4 of Anapanasati is to relax the body Let the body be at rest. Now, I know that the old translators, some of them who didn't really understand what they were translating, would use the word tranquilize. Tranquilize is not a very good word to use. Okay, we don't use restful darts, we use tranquilizer darts. All right, and the animal that is tranquilized is out of it. We're looking at rest or at peace, comfortable, relaxed. This is the state of the body that in fact in actually some of the suttas, the first Jhana does have that relaxed body as the sixth element, though some of them have only five elements. But we're practicing that, and in fact the whole intention of Anapanasati is to bring the practitioner into the first Jhana, which is hallmarked by freedom from the hindrances. The hindrances are gone. You're in a state of Sukkha, no anxiety, no worries, no frustrations, no discomfort, so that we can get into that state of, "This is good enough." This is nice, this is satisfying. Coming into that state of satisfactory is actually the point of the teaching of the Buddha, is to come out of the Dukkha, come out of our dissatisfactions, and come into a state of everything's okay, I'm satisfied. And from there, we bring on that Piti, or that confidence, or those highs will come from time to time. But when they fall back, they fall back into a state of comfort, rest, rather than, oh, I want that again, because now we're dissatisfied with the state that we're in. So we always stay with that quality of the state of satisfaction, right?

**Speaker B:** So I think that's what happened when I was really— when I first started meditating, I had Piti experiences, but I, um, I couldn't maintain them, so I lost interest. But then I Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** But that's okay because the fallback is excellent, good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I've realized that I'm an expert at my own mistakes. I've learned so much from just going down these blind alleys and going, ah, that didn't work, so let's try something else. It always— okay, it fixes itself if you just carry on. Yeah, good.

**Speaker A:** Counting them all, freedom from the hindrances, being in a state of Sukkha, Everything is okay, occasionally having that Piti, and then the next Jhana factors would be what they call Applied and Sustained Thought, that in fact we apply the mind to get it into that state, and then we practice trying to maintain it. So let's keep that good feeling going, that that's sustaining, and all Westerners, you know, we like high numbers, we want it better and better, 'You know, a bazillion dollars is not enough, I need bazillion, bazillion dollars.' So, if we could come to the state that what we've got is good enough, and continue to keep that going, that's then a hallmark of the first Jhana. And the last one, number 6, would be comfort of the body. Relaxed, because if the body is relaxed, the feelings relax, the mind is relaxed, and this is the whole point. Now we can spend our time recognizing everything is temporary. Yeah, let it go. Ah, that hindrance is there. Never mind, start again and keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. That's the, that's the whole practice, and that when students have questions, they're in a state of doubt and the hindrances keep coming back. Never mind, start again. Never mind, start again. Or let us ply the mind back to getting it into a good state.

**Speaker B:** Can I just go back to something you said earlier? You were talking about knots being so, you know, that the fixation on sitting practice I do lying practice when I'm going at nighttime or just during the day if I'm resting. Even driving, you can stop at a traffic light or walking mindfully or aware. So there are lots of opportunities for this kind of experience to be practiced all day, really, aren't there? So I can keep doing that, which is what I'm doing already, which is good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not looking for anything else. What you're doing is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, yeah, good. Now that's great, I just needed those little pointers, that's really helpful just to make sure that I'm tracking with it, and I am. Fantastic. Yeah, I think I feel like the handbrake's come off and my practice is just surging forward now, so I'm really pleased for your help with it. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Great, great. One last point, and that is that the word enlightenment is not in the Pali Canon anywhere, that that's a modern term that comes to Western language. But it has some value because it fits in with the Buddhist teaching in a certain way, and that is, is that there's two kinds of uses for the word enlightenment. One is to shine a light on it, daylight, And that has the quality of seeing, knowledge. All right, we can see what's going on, and when we see what's going on, that's a form of enlightenment. Yep. And the next quality of it is, is that once we see what it is, when we can see the burden, like thoughts of the past, thoughts of the future, thoughts of anxiety, then we can drop it, we can relinquish it, we can let it go, we can deliver it, we can lighten up. Okay, so lightening up is the actual outcome of shining a light. Once we see that it's a belt, not a snake, we can let go of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, I love that analogy. I'm finding that definitely I'm able to shine a light now spontaneously on a whole lot of things that were kind of hidden from me and within my own mind and, you know, what's going on around me. And that just seems to happen as a side effect of this practice. A lot of things are coming very clear, and that's been happening for a while. So I think that feels like that's what's happening, that I can understand things quickly and see to the root of what's going on and respond accordingly. And that's been really helpful in my life. So I'm so— all right.

**Speaker A:** Well, in a way though, many people practice wrongly in the sense that enlightenment becomes a burden. Why? Because it's something that they want. And one of the big definitions of Dukkha is wanting something you don't have. And we could say, if you had a choice about either being enlightened or being satisfied, wouldn't being satisfied be better than enlightened? Just being satisfied, being happy with what you've got, because you threw it off, you dismounted the burden, and yet many Westerners are looking for something special. Where do we go from here? What comes next? And really the answer to what comes next is the next breath, the next thought, the next feeling of joy, one after another. This is really what we're looking for, is to come into a state of satisfaction, rather than looking for a state of special.

**Speaker B:** And it's the great irony, isn't it? As soon as I stop striving for some idea of a state and just relax and go with what's here, a whole lot of amazing things start happening.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's it. It was closer than the nose on my face the whole time. Suddenly, oh, I see.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. It's not a hard practice, but there will come times when it's hard to practice. And the answer to that being hard to practice is, never mind, start again. It was only hard because I had the thought hard. It was only hard because I didn't like it. So all I have to do is change your attitude of, yeah, but it's good enough. Yeah, yeah. So the mind wanders away. Never mind, start again, bring it back. Let's have our pleasure right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** There's always another breath.

**Speaker A:** There's always the next— always just the next breath.

**Speaker B:** Pick it up next time. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, thank you. Why don't— Grant, why don't we finish this now? And I hope that you call back.

**Speaker B:** Yep, really appreciate talking with you, and I'll join the Sangha talks a little bit more as well. So we'll talk again soon.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you're quite welcome. We got quite a crowd that are regularly posting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm enjoying spending time with them. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Take care. See you soon.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and the practitioner (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: Correcting Practice Towards Joy and Satisfaction**
The central theme is a shift away from striving for "progress" or special states (like intense *piti*) and toward cultivating a consistent baseline of contentment (*sukkha*) and satisfaction in the present moment.

### **Main Points Discussed:**

1.  **The Goal is Satisfaction, Not "Progress":** Dhammarato emphasizes that the aim is not to "make progress" toward a future goal like enlightenment, but to **"come out of *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction) right here, right now."** The practice is about finding that what you have in this moment is "good enough."

2.  **Critique of Common Misconceptions:**
    *   **"Formal" Sitting:** The Buddha did not prescribe a rigid "formal" sitting practice. Practice can be done in any posture (sitting, walking, lying down) and in daily life.
    *   **Western & Mahasi Methods:** He criticizes approaches that focus on dissecting and investigating unpleasant states (*dukkha*), comparing it to picking up and analyzing dog excrement. The correct approach is to **avoid it and step around it.**
    *   **"Choiceless Awareness":** Similarly, simply being aware of everything without skillful intervention is like stepping in the excrement.

3.  **The Correct Framework: The Eightfold Path (as a moment-to-moment practice):**
    *   **Start with *Pañña* (Wisdom/Investigation):** This is **Right View**—investigating what is happening in the mind and body *right now*.
    *   **Apply *Samma Vāyāma* (Right Effort):** This is the crucial step. When you see an unwholesome state (a hindrance like anxiety, wandering mind, dwelling on past/future), you **actively change it** to a wholesome one.
    *   **Cultivate Wholesome States:** Replace hindrances with thoughts like "This is nice," "I feel safe," "Everything is okay right now." This **"gladdens the mind."**

4.  **Key Attitudinal Shifts:**
    *   **From Victim to Champion:** Shift from "poor me, I need to meditate" to "**I've got this. I'm the boss of my mind right now.**" This builds confidence (*saddhā*), not blind faith.
    *   **Celebrate and Nurture:** Actively notice and **celebrate the joy, calm, and accomplishment** in your practice, even if it's just one peaceful breath. This "adds fuel to the fire."
    *   **Playful and Gentle:** When the mind wanders, don't criticize. Use a playful attitude: "**Aha, I see you, Mara**," or "**Never mind, start again.**" Be nurturing, not harsh.

5.  **Clarification of Terms & States:**
    *   ***Sukkha* (Contentment):** This is the **primary goal**—a base camp of feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. "Everything is all right."
    *   ***Piti* (Joy/Rapture):** This is a **momentary peak** or exhilaration ("Wow, this is great!") that arises from *sukkha*. It's not to be clung to; you always return to the steady base of *sukkha*.
    *   **Enlightenment:** Redefined as 1) **shining a light** of awareness on what's happening, and 2) **lightening up** by letting go of burdens once you see them.

6.  **Practical Advice for the Practitioner:**
    *   **Increase Frequency:** The practitioner found that more frequent, shorter sessions helped maintain mindfulness and reduce anxiety throughout the day.
    *   **Comfort is Key:** Practice in a comfortable posture. Discomfort is a hindrance; adjust your position to stay relaxed.
    *   **Use the Breath (*Ānāpānasati*):** Use the breath to relax the body and let go of anxiety. Celebrate each breath.
    *   **Guard the Senses:** In practice, keep attention simple and close (e.g., the breath, the path ahead, the feeling of calm).
    *   **Deal with Memories/Wandering:** If joyful memories arise, don't get lost in them. Use the feeling of joy to anchor yourself in the **present-moment joy**. If anxious or distracting thoughts arise, recognize them and gently return.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a course correction towards a simpler, more joyful, and present-moment-focused practice. The essence is to **stop striving for a special future state** and instead **cultivate a satisfied, confident, and playful attitude toward the present experience**, using Right Effort to continually replace dissatisfaction with contentment. The practitioner confirms that this shift has taken the "handbrake" off their practice, reduced anxiety, and allowed natural clarity to arise.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely a meditation teacher) uses several key metaphors and stories to explain the practice. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Dog Turd / Avoiding Hindrances:** This is the most vivid metaphor. The speaker contrasts different meditation approaches:
    *   **"Mahasi Method" (or dissecting dukkha):** Picking up a dog turd from the street, taking it inside, and dissecting it.
    *   **"Vajrayana method of choiceless awareness":** Stepping right in the dog turd.
    *   **The "correct" practice (Right Effort):** Simply avoiding the dog turd, stepping around it. This illustrates the core idea of letting go of unwholesome thoughts (hindrances) rather than intensely investigating or indulging in them.

2.  **Driving / Focusing on the Road:** Used by both speakers.
    *   Speaker B compares his old approach to focusing on a power pole (the problem/anxiety) he was heading toward, while the new approach is focusing on the road (the sukha/joy) he wants to travel.
    *   Speaker A extends it: When driving (or walking mindfully), you only need to look 10-20 feet ahead—just enough to avoid snakes, puddles, or obstacles. This represents staying present and "guarding the senses," not getting distracted by the past, future, or peripheral things.

3.  **The Mountain & Base Camp:** Speaker B uses this to describe his state.
    *   The **"base camp"** is the steady, satisfactory state of *sukkha* (calm, content, safe). It's a solid foundation.
    *   The **"peak"** is the momentary, exhilarating state of *piti* (joy, rapture). The goal isn't to live at the peak but to have a solid, enjoyable base camp and occasionally visit the summit.

4.  **Lightening the Load / Enlightenment:** Speaker A redefines "enlightenment" using a play on words.
    *   **"Shining a light"** on something (seeing it clearly, understanding it).
    *   **"Lightening up"** or **"lightening the load"** as the result. Once you see a burden (e.g., anxiety, a past thought) clearly, you can drop it. Enlightenment is about letting go, not acquiring something special.

5.  **The Lion vs. The Victim:** An **attitude metaphor**. The practitioner should move from the attitude of a **victim** ("poor me, I need to meditate") to that of a **lion** ("I'm the boss of my mind right now; I've got this").

6.  **The Complaint Department:** A metaphor for the mind's tendency to dwell on what's wrong. We take our worries to an internal (or heavenly) "complaint department" instead of shifting to an attitude of acceptance and satisfaction with the present moment.

7.  **Fuel / Handbrake:** Speaker B uses these mechanical metaphors.
    *   Noticing joy adds **"fuel to the fire"** of practice.
    *   Focusing on positivity **"taken the handbrake off,"** allowing his mind to work naturally and progress smoothly.

### **Stories & Analogies:**

1.  **The Story of the Church Pews:** Speaker A tells an anecdote about a Thai temple (*wat*) in Chicago that bought an old Baptist church. There was a debate about removing the pews to sit on the floor, as is traditional. The story makes the point that sitting on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia, not an essential part of the Buddha's teaching, which emphasizes comfort in any posture.

2.  **The Journey from Oklahoma City to California:** Used to elaborate on the driving metaphor. The key is not to focus on the distant destination (California/enlightenment) but to keep your eye on the road right in front of you (the present moment, the next breath).

3.  **The Lullaby / Self-Talk:** Speaker A suggests using reassuring self-talk like singing yourself a lullaby—"Everything is all right, everything is fine"—to cultivate a sense of safety and security, especially to counter anxiety. This is framed as a practical strategy of "nurturing ourselves rather than being critical."

4.  **The Belt Mistaken for a Snake:** Referenced in the "lightening up" explanation. Once you shine a light (mindfulness) and see the coiled object is a belt, not a snake (the thought is just a thought, not a threat), you can let go of the fear. Understanding leads to relinquishing.

**Core Narrative:** Woven throughout these metaphors is a **central story of correction**. The speaker is contrasting a perceived "Western Buddhism" (focused on formal sitting, dissecting suffering, striving for special enlightenment) with what he presents as the Buddha's actual teaching: an informal, moment-to-moment practice of avoiding unwholesome states, cultivating satisfaction (*sukkha*) and joy (*piti*) in the present, and thereby "lightening up." The metaphors serve to make this corrected path vivid and practical.
