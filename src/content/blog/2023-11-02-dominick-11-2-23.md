### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So Dominic, I'm glad to see you again. We got cut off last time, but we can continue on. And I'd like to start with the point about that if you could get yourself into a relaxed, happy state, What else is it that you want?

**Speaker B:** I mean, so I like those states. Like, I'm able to get into them sometimes. At the same time, there is something that I do like about the kind of more driven, achievement-oriented states as well.

**Speaker A:** What kind of driven?

**Speaker B:** The more like driven achievement-oriented states that are less kind of relaxed, but are more, for me at least, I don't experience them as being relaxed, but are.

**Speaker A:** More like— Oh, you mean like a professional football player making a touchdown?

**Speaker B:** Sure, yeah. I mean, for me it's not football, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, he likes it for a little while. And then he has to go make another touchdown in another game or later in this game, and then he'll feel good about that, maybe having the big pow, dancing, spiking the ball, all of that kind of stuff. But that kind of benefit is short-lived, and so he's got to go do it again, because he's not happy and relaxed, he's goal-oriented. And the first Jhana is— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was saying, yeah, I mean, it's definitely a trend. There's nothing like lasting about it, but it's still— there's also something a little bit seductive about it as well. Like, I go back and forth in terms of what I want. But go— I mean, I see the point, which is that there's really nothing nothing really there except for like a momentary experience, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, you called it seductive. The fact is, is that it's not that that's seductive, it's that you have been seduced into believing that it's valuable. The people who go to football games seduce the players on the field to those temporary highs. Okay, yeah, in fact, in a way, we could talk about it as skill development, but some skills are not all of that valuable in learning to live our lives in a comfortable, happy way. And so we go from one goal to another, wanting something, getting it. Sometimes we want something, we get it, then we have to put up with it. And sometimes we get something, we love it, we take care of it, and then we lose it. So all the while, there's always Dukkha, or dissatisfaction, at the end of it. The question is, can we develop a practice or a skill that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, rather than disappointing in the end? Or like most meditation practitioners, it's hard work in the beginning, it's misery in the middle, And it never ends. But there is a way of getting the mind into a state that's good, and it can last if you keep practicing at it, developing the skills to go back into it and to maintain it. That is being in a happy, relaxed state. Well, we don't have to deal with the society and its prisons and taxes and officials and any of that, because they're not a problem. If you start thinking about them, you'll get yourself all worked up. So it's better just to throw them out and be happy instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I see. I, I know. I mean, that's what you mean. It's like trying to change them is sort of like the same kind of achievement trip that the football player is on.

**Speaker A:** Well, wouldn't it be valuable and wholesome to achieve being happy without needing to do anything? Just be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Right. Yeah. What we're actually working with right now, there's a statement that the Buddha had made that's actually repeated a lot along those lines, is that the teaching of the Buddha is profound, it's subtle, it's difficult for people to comprehend and understand because of the mind state that they're in. But we can in fact change that mind state if we practice correctly. And this is actually— you mentioned the word Jhana. The first Jhana is in fact that state. It needs to be well practiced so that you come back to that state over and over and over again. With the first point is to remove the hindrances. What are the hindrances? That's all that we've been talking about: prisons, politicians, judges, cops, taxes, money. All of those things, when we're thinking about them, wind up being hindrances to us being in a really good, happy state. And so we need to remove those hindrances from the mind, and that that's the issue of the hindrances is actually quite well known in all of the various kinds of Buddhism. And yet when it comes time to practice removing the hindrances, they forget all about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I'm curious, like, in terms of removing them, like, let's say you're practicing something like Anapanasati. When some thought comes up that's like, you know, associated with stress or whatever, like mechanically, how would you deal with it? Because I mean, Like the sort of Mahasi approach is to kind of like try and break it apart into its parts and make that the object temporarily.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that breaking it apart is just more Dukkha. So if it's a hindrance, then why break the hindrance apart and see the various qualities of the hindrance rather than just merely coming out of it because you know it's a hindrance?

**Speaker B:** So by coming out, do you mean just like shifting your attention away from it back to the Mahayana?

**Speaker A:** Diversion is one of the primary beginner's methods, is to divert yourself to something else. And if you're wise, diverting it to something wholesome. To remove the unwholesome thoughts, remove the hindrances, and to come into the present moment and think about the way things are right now. Because almost all of those thoughts, for instance, thoughts about prisons— guess what? There is no prison on this island. All the prisons that I think about would be old prisons that came because somebody told me about it, or I saw a movie or something like that. And so the movie, after I watched the movie and it stopped, it's now an old movie. And if I keep thinking about that movie, I'm just making myself feel bad. And so stop thinking about all the stuff including pulling it apart, investigating it, is a waste of time. In fact, it's an unsatisfactory waste of time. And that we're wanting some outcome— oh, if I pull that Dukkha apart and examine it, maybe it'll go away by itself. And it doesn't. It's going to keep coming back. The question is, do you have the skills to deal with it when it does come up? Yeah, I might have mentioned this before, but here's one of the delusions that we have commonly. We believe that a big tall tree, hundreds of feet in the air, has a root system that goes deep into the ground. And the answer to that is no. That in fact, gravediggers know that by the time they get 6 feet down, they're not going to find any roots at all. All the roots that they have are right on the surface. The same thing is true about Dukkha. There is no deeply buried Dukkha, even if it's old stuff, happened when you were in diapers. When it comes up, it's not deep. In fact, if things were deep, they couldn't come up. The fact is that they're right there on the surface, ready for the mind to wander into an unwholesome state, because we've been practicing wandering into unwholesome states. And so the way that we deal with this is with the Eightfold Noble Path, most specifically is that we remember to look at what we're thinking about, to remember to look at what we're doing. That's the two twin things that in fact that's something that Mahasi Method does do. They teach the students to remember to look, but, and it's a great big but, not looking at it in the right way. We often conceptualize the Dukkha rather than recognizing it immediately as Dukkha and just throwing it out. We see this Dukkha and we connect it to that Dukkha and it's explained this way and it's got that Dukkha and then we go down the Dukkha rat hole. And the right way to do it is to wake up and say, "Hey, this is an unwholesome thought, let me change it. Let me distract myself." Let me distract myself into something just really valuable and wholesome. This happening right now. To take a deep breath and relax.

**Speaker B:** So you really see no value in the kind of dissolution experience that can kind of— let's say if you're like my own experience, right? Like if I do kind of break things down in this way, like after it takes a while, like an hour or 2 hours, whatever, I do kind of come out the other side and end up in something that, I mean, to me, the way in which I experience it, like matches the description of like the fourth Jhana in the suttas.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, basically, isn't that the same thing as having the football and running all the way down the hill, down the the field and then make the touchdown? Then you've got to do it again. So where the real training of the Buddha has to do with training, skill development, thus one trains oneself is very, very commonly stated in the Anapanasati Sutta. Gladdening the mind while breathing in and breathing out mindfully Thus one trains oneself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so yeah, I mean, certainly the approach does kind of contradict what is said, at least in that sutta, about that approach.

**Speaker A:** The actual teaching of the Buddha kind of contradicts all of society, including Western Buddhism. Dhammarato, that Western Buddhism does not teach people how to be happy. It teaches them to remain in their goal-oriented state of, oh, I've got to go get this attainment, I've got to go get that attainment, I've got to have some Nibbana. To where Nibbana will only come when you stop spinning the wheels wanting something. And so the important point, in fact, the word that we could use that's really, really valuable is the word satisfied, satisfaction. Why? Because Dukkha really is— the definition of the word is being dissatisfied. Where does dissatisfaction come from? So you can investigate Dukkha left, right, and center and still be in a state of dissatisfaction. You want to get rid of it. Instead of just getting rid of it. Now, I've made mention of the fact before that the Western practice that they call Mahasi originally did not come from Mahasi Samadhi, that his practices had joy built in to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind, to become joyful. And yet you don't hear any of the Mahayana teachers talking about actually making the change right here, right now. It's almost like a practice of postponed gratification. Is that not true? That when you get to the bottom of the Dukkha, you'll be free of it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, the way it's framed by the kind of more sophisticated teachers is that ultimately you're on a kind of more primal level. Your perceptual system just stops really, just learns to stop identifying with all this, with the six sense doors, and you just kind of let go.

**Speaker A:** All right, but how are you going to learn if you don't train? That it's not going to just happen on its own. That's magical thinking. Eventually, somewhere in there, we have to make the decision, I'm going to stop doing this and make a change.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think they would argue that the practice itself is the training that you kind of put yourself through enough that like the Ultimately, you realize like, okay, there's really just like nothing there, and then you kind of let go of it. I'm not— All right, here's the question:.

**Speaker A:** Why don't we realize that right away? Why does it take a long time to realize it?

**Speaker B:** Habit, I guess. You— Arahant.

**Speaker A:** All right. In fact, not only is it the habit of most individual people, it's also the habit of the meditation teachers. And so because they've been taking so long, they expect it for you to take it so long. And besides, they can make a living off of it. But the teaching of the Buddha is immediate, immediate success. The way that I say it sometimes is the way that Westerners are practicing it, it's Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha is the way that the Buddha talks about it, but the way that it's practiced is dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, let me look at that dukkha, let me take that dukkha apart and make two dukkhas out of it and connect it to this dukkha and that dukkha and dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, and eventually I'll stop doing the dukkha. So why not stop doing the dukkha? Right away. And this is the whole point about the hindrances that you heard so much about, and yet they don't teach: see that hindrance and throw it out immediately, which is the actual teaching of the Buddha. And then be relieved that hindrances are like being in jail. You get out of jail free.

**Speaker B:** Right? Yeah, I think it's a bit the influence of psychoanalysis too, right? Like where the idea is that you're supposed to face your pain, like in Western psychology, you're supposed to kind of like face your pain or face the dissatisfactions of your childhood or whatever, and then you kind of learn to kind of accept. So that kind of gets a bit, that's sort of baked into a bit the narrative It is, it really is, Vajrayana.

**Speaker A:** The reason for that is because the people who become psychologists are actually failed clients. That I went to a psychologist and I went to a psychologist year after year through my high school days, and so I still want to be free, maybe the right thing to do is to become a psychologist. Yeah, yeah, that's— and so that's what you wind up with. I've got a little joke about that, and that is, is that the guy went to the shrink and they did some what is called archaeological, uh, psychological archaeology, digging into the past. And, and the guy comes up with, oh, I remember my mommy gave me a great big spanking when I was 4 years old, and psychiatrist says, great, that's it, now we know why you're such an asshole. And neither one of them realized that mommy gave him the spanking because he was an asshole before the spanking. And so that archaeology didn't do much good because he's still going to continue to be an asshole, and now he hates his mom too for giving him a spanking. That in fact what we need to do instead is stop dwelling in the past, stop doing psychological archaeology, stop digging, just stop these hindrances of wanting things to be better and start practicing things are already okay right now. But like I said, that goes against the grain of the way that everybody thinks. Here's another point that's really quite valuable for many students when they realize it. You've no doubt heard about the 16 stages of insight that the Mahasi people use. They got that out of the Visuddhimagga and the Visuddhi— oh, I forgot how to say it. Tathagata Samadhi Bhagavata, which is an even older text. And if you really understand what that stuff is, you'll see that starting with step 6, they go into fearfulness, misery, disgust, anguish, and hit kind of rock bottom. That also has a great longing just a longing, a great longing to get out of it. This is in fact the state that most people, when they start meditation, they're already in there, and they just go into more longing deeper in their practice. And that's Step 10, followed by what is referred to as a redoubling of their effort to get out of it. And then Step 12 is the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. All right, and so all of these stages, stage 1 through 10 or 11, up to 12, is ordinary practice by ordinary people doing ordinary things until everything falls apart, and then they start the noble practice. And so Ajahn Po has advised me to start with the noble, start with the supramundane, start at step 12 of these 16 stages of insight. This is where you start, and all of that preliminary stuff is just money-making operations because nobody gets any place in there with the practice until they come to the point that I've got to make a change. And then the practice starts, the real practice, the valuable stuff, only starts when you've got to make a change and you know that you've got to make a change. That in fact, this goes with AA, that because it was somewhat successful at getting people out of their alcoholism, judges for a number of years would sentence someone to go into AA. Yeah, and, and it didn't work. Why? Because the judge can't make you want to change. And it's only when people really want to make a change that they can make a change. And so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of it's a change model. It's up to you. Are you going to live out your old Kamma over and over and over again, evaluate it, pull it apart, part, talk about it, or are you going to throw it out and make a change? Are you going to throw those hindrances out as soon as you see them? This is the correct practice of the Buddha, is to wake up, take a look, and make a change. And we practice that over and over and over again until we get pretty good at coming out of our delusion coming out of our desire and wanting and develop the habit of being satisfied with the way things are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. It sounds like overly— like, I'll just be totally honest. Like, to me, it sounds very almost like excessively, excessively simple.

**Speaker A:** Um, it is, it is a simple thing to do. You have no doubt heard the Chinese expression that a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Yeah, right. But you have to make another step, and you still got about a thousand miles to go, and you make another step, and you still got 1,000 miles to go. And step after step after step after step may not get you any closer to the goal, but you get pretty good at making your steps. So this is what we really are practicing, and ultimately the practice is to give up those that we really don't have to step, that this is much more of a metaphorical way of talking about it, is to make a change in the mind. But we have to keep doing it over and over and over again. It's a very simple thing to do, and you do it right now. And there's going to be another now as the clock ticks by, and then another now. Are you going to do it again? And then another now. Are you going to do it again and again and again and again? This is simple thing to do that you have to keep doing, making a change. That's all there is to it. Now, one of the aspects of the hindrances is that we have words for it like anxiety. Anagami, anxiety comes from unwholesome thoughts. 'Oh, well, what if that goes bad?' Or, 'What if this messes up?' Or, 'What if I didn't check the code?' Or, 'What if the flat tire?' You know, all of this kind of 'what ifs,' 'what ifs,' 'what ifs.' And sometimes those 'what ifs' come up so fast because we're really good at them that we don't even recognize that it's our 'what ifs' that cause our anxiety and our fear. And so what we can practice instead is telling ourselves there's really nothing to fear right now. Any dangers that you've ever had or ever will have were in the past or in the future, but right now you're safe. But most people don't feel safe, even though the reality is, is that they are safe. Got the door closed, there's nobody there, there's no alligators, there's no spiders, there's no snakes, there's no mafia, there's no cops, there's no SWAT team, there's no mother-in-laws, and you're safe. There's no emails to write, and just sitting and being comfortable. And people have the old anxieties and the old fears will come up, but they come up not as a reality, they come up as a habit, the old tendencies. The question is, can you wake up and see that and make a change and start telling yourself, oh, let me take a deep breath and I can breathe that anxiety out. Let me watch it dissipate. Let me tell myself how comfortable and relaxed how safe and secure I really am. It's not dangerous right now. So these are the kind of wholesome thoughts that we can substitute for the kind of thoughts that give us anxiety. We can have comforting thoughts. Instead of what— there's two kinds of thinking that is commonly understood in psychology, and that is critical thinking, or a critical parent versus a nurturing parent. So can you come out of your analyzing critical nature and start comforting and nourishing yourself? Everything's going to be all right. Everything is fine. And then we can analyze from that position to recognize everything really is okay. And then the anxiety will come back. Never mind, I see that anxiety. Take a deep breath and recognize that, hey, there's nothing really to be anxious and upset and uptight about. Let me just relax again. And then again it'll happen, and again we make a change. But most people will stay in that state of anxiety. Henry David Thoreau calls it the state of being in quiet desperation. Most men live lives of quiet desperation. They're full of anxiety. They're almost desperate. And we can see that and make a change. Now one of the things about the practice of Anapanasati is that it's a complete practice. We have the body, the feelings, the mind, the mind's objects. If we can start changing the mind's objects, and start changing our attitude and changing the mind states that we're in, the place to start is by being in a safe, comfortable place. Mostly that means in seclusion, being away from other people. So the Buddha recommends go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw, and sit down and bring mindfulness to the fore, which basically means start looking at what we're doing, start looking at what we're thinking so that we can make a change to it. Now when I say that, I'm covering, gosh, more than a dozen suttas. There's a long description of the hindrances both in the Satipatthana Sutta as well as Sutta Number 39 in the Majjhima Nikaya. But most of the practitioners and meditation teachers don't insist that the students drop those hindrances as soon as they arise. They say, "Oh well, if you analyze them, someday they'll stop." No, they won't. They won't stop until you demand that they stop and throw them out as soon as they arise. Throw it out. Why should you wait 15, 20, 30, 50 years of meditation practice before you start practicing correctly? Why not start practicing correctly right from the get-go, right from the very beginning? And so what we want to do then is get the body in a safe, comfortable place. So you're in an empty room right now, you're in an empty hut right now, so that means that you're actually safe. The body feels safe. Why doesn't the mind and the feelings feel safe? Is because the mind keeps bringing stuff up that is not safe. But the reality is that you are safe. And so in a way, you're dreaming. You're dreaming up, manufacturing problems that in the right now, they don't exist. So let's start looking at what does exist. The reality is safe. Secure, comfortable, relaxed. So let's practice that. Let's start thinking about, yeah, things really are safe, things really are secure, things really are comfortable, things really are relaxed. And we keep thinking about it that way. And when the hindrances come back— hindrances of doubt, hindrances of wanting something, hindrances of trying to get rid of something that we don't want— restlessness, worry, agitation, all of that, and say, wait a minute, let's just throw that stuff out and be comfortable and happy and secure right now. This is the new skill that needs to be developed, is everything's all right, everything's fine, no worries, we can do this. Now, in this way of speaking, we're actually practicing both the Eightfold Noble Path and Anapanasati together. That as we practice Anapanasati, it's for the fulfillment of the Eightfold Noble Path, and it's also for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana, which actually is the remembering of the foundations. And what are the foundations? Remember the body, remember how we feel, remember to look at what we're thinking about, we're looking at what mind states that we have. And when we continue to practice that, the Eightfold Noble Path turns into or transforms or becomes through practice the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the Sambhojana. So what are the factors of enlightenment is the practice. And the beginner, they have to practice because they've got no skills. But when the skills are already developed, now we have unremitting Sati. Anytime that something comes up, hot dog, I remember to look at that. And when we do remember, then we can investigate. Now what the Mahasi Method does is they teach you to remember to investigate and investigate and investigate and investigate and investigate until you get fed up with it up to here. It's dangerous in there, it's terrible, it's miserable. We got to get out of this. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching of the Buddha starts with 3 points, not 2: to wake up, to remember, to take a look, and then hot dog, make a change immediately. Right noble effort to throw those hindrances out. As soon as you see that there's hindrances there, you do not need to analyze them. You do not need to do any archaeological investigation. That when you're digging around in the mind, the roots are on the surface. They're not deeply buried. You don't have to go digging deep. You just dig into it, you see it's a root, got it, there it is, pitch it out. So we start with wholesome thoughts. The wholesome thoughts would be Everything is okay, I'm not afraid, I feel safe and secure, I feel comfortable. And we keep practicing that, and pretty soon we come up with the real point, and that is satisfaction. Now, actually what I'm doing is I'm using the Pali dictionary definition of the word Sukkha, because it's right there in the suttas, right there in the Anapanasati Anapanasati Sutra, that Sukkha is to be developed through gladdening the mind, changing the mind, getting the body comfortable and relaxed, and then Sukkha will arise. And what is Sukkha? The feeling of safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And voilà, you're already there, you're completely enlightened. Why? Because the whole teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means dissatisfaction, see it and come out of it. Well, if you're in a state of Sukkha, you just came out. Congratulations! Right now, no Dukkha. Why analyze Dukkha when you can just throw it out? Have you ever heard of the term pack rat?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's what most humans are in their own mind. We're pack rats. What does that mean? That every time that we see an old newspaper, instead of saying, "That's old news, I don't need it anymore," and throw it out, we say, "Oh, maybe I'll need that someday," and I put it back on the stack. And pretty soon the whole house is loaded down with old newspapers, old books, old trash, old garbage. Or imagine the chef, that he's cutting his food and putting all the waste and all of that into the garbage, and his waiter or his servant or whoever is cleaning the kitchen starts to pick up the trash to take it out, and the chef says, wait a minute, there may be something in here of value. Let me dig through my garbage. That's the Mahasi method, to dig through the garbage. Wouldn't it be better for the chef to— even if there's something valuable in there, I mean, he can be mindful when he throws things into the garbage. It doesn't have to be— Jackie just throw the garbage out, take it out. So this is the real practice of the Buddha, real practice of Anapanasati, is to make a change right here, right now. But then the next moment, look at it again, make a change right here, right now, throw it out. Look at it again, make a change, throw it out. Then you look at it again. Wow, this is nice. Okay, then redouble that and do it again, over and over and over again. This is the practice of both Anapanasati and the Eightfold Noble Path. And pretty soon we get into that state of Sukkha, free from Dukkha, satisfied. Things are good enough. Things are good enough right now the way that they are. And over time, something new happens, and that is we begin to get the confidence that this skill works. I don't have to say, oh well, I got to do something now because way off in the future something might happen, and begin instead the attitude of, hey, if it does, I'll be ready for it. If I can get myself happy right now when nothing's happening, I'll get the skill so that when something is happening, I can still be ready for it and be happy. Eventually you're going to die. Can you practice to get ready to be happy when you die, or are you going to be miserable when you die? Most people are miserable. Why not practice to be in a good state, so that if you do die, you can die in a happy state, be in heaven? So don't worry about the future. Worry about can you practice it right now over and over again, and confidence will build. Yes, I can. Remember to throw that stuff out, the hindrances, and make a change. And confidence grows. The Pali word for it is Saddha, and the Sanskrit word for it is Shraddha. Sanskrit tends to put a lot of Rs in words— Dharma, Karma, Nirvana.

**Speaker B:** Arya, I noticed that.

**Speaker A:** And the original language doesn't have those Rs in it. It's Dhamma, Kamma, Nibbana, and here Srotapanna or Saddha means to have confidence. This is also on the Eightfold Noble Path. So as waking up, taking a look, and making a change happens over and over again, they run in circle around each other. And the skills that we have develop accordingly. So waking up helps us to remember to look. Making a change helps us to remember to look. Looking makes it easier to change, especially if you can see it early, it's easier to change. It's easier to start when For instance, like a leak. If the leak can be seen early, it's easy to take care of. But if it gets so bad that the whole pipe is burst, now you've got a big flood you've got to take care of, as well as the repair of the pipe. So yeah, these things work and run around one another, and then this new thing happens, which is the confidence. Of, wow, I could do this. And the wow is the most important quality of this. This is where satisfaction becomes success. I could do this. I can remember to be happy. I can remember to be satisfied. I could do it. And then we get into that wow state, which is referred to as Piti, badly translated, by the way, as rapture. The word rapture already has rap built into it, and the Christians have stolen that word and taken themselves to heaven as soon as something magical happens, which it never has. And so it's not a— it's a terrible translation. But Piti actually means instead having a high or a wow sensation. It's like Sukkha is pleasure. And Piti, and Piti-Sukkha is a really going of it, "I like it, it's good," and that this is what's developed in Anapanasati, but also the Anapanasati that's developing this is exactly the first Jhana. The first Jhana is number one, free from hindrances. So people who are analyzing Dukkha never get into the first Jhana. They'll still spend years thinking that they're trying to get a fourth Jhana and they can't even manage getting into the first Jhana until they've gotten to the point of, "I've had enough of this and I'm making a change." And then they can start practicing Anapanasati. Anapanasati that will develop eventually into removing of the hindrances, followed by the Sukkha, followed by the Piti, and all along they keep applying the mind to the wholesome, applying to the mind to the wholesome, applying and applying and sustaining and being able to get ourselves into this state and stay there. Not allow the hindrances to come back in. That's the first Jhana with those things: freedom of the hindrances, the development of Sukkha, the development of Piti. Apply that, sustain it, and keep it going. And there's also a sixth addition to it, which is relaxation. We relax the body, we relax the mind. We come into a state of relaxation. And that's how we practice over and over and over and over again. And we can do that while driving a car. We can do that while watching TV, to remember that I don't have to think about that TV and how bad things are on the TV. I can still be in a state of happiness and joy. Maybe I'd be even more happy and joyful if I turn that TV off and just relax. So this is the practice. Now, if you can get yourself into that state to where you feel satisfied, confident, you feel like that you're the winner, that you're the boss of your life, what else do you want? Magical powers? People who want magical powers are already victims. They want the power so that they can take revenge revenge on somebody or prove how great they are. But if you already feel really great, you don't need magical powers. That in fact, this strength of mind, in a way, for most people, is a magical power. But it's real. It's not a magical power, it's just real power. The power of being satisfied, the power of being on top of your own world. This is what the supramundane, or lokottara, or you've heard the term sitting on top of the world, be above the world, to be above all of our problems. How do we get there? By practicing one moment at a time. There's also the old story about every one of us is an emperor of our own pile of dirt. I love this story. Everyone's an emperor of their own pile of dirt, but most people, the emperor is buried under their pile of dirt of all those unwholesome thoughts and all their past, all the crap. And then the Mahasi people are trying to claw their way out of it. Meditators, people who go to shrinks and psychologists, are trying to claw their way out of it. But really, it's an attitude change. So would you rather be buried under your pile of dirt, clawing your way out of it, or merely just sitting on top of your world? So begin to have the thoughts of, I've already arrived. This is good enough. No place to go. I've gotten it. These are the wholesome thoughts that we can develop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it makes sense. I think the way in which the more kind of like Vipassana-oriented practice was sort of like is like kind of sold, or the way I sold myself on it was the, like, I don't know, maybe like, maybe it is like sort of lack of confidence that one would be able to maintain that kind of relaxed state in like kind of stressful situations. So like, it's like, okay, well then just like learn how to like completely disidentify with whatever's happening to you so that you don't, uh, really, um, you don't, you don't buy it, you don't buy into it because— okay, yeah, I, I guess I'm not really being that articulate, but I— you can understand, I think you understand what I mean.

**Speaker A:** Um, all right, okay, well, that's also valuable. We have been talking about mainly just distraction. Yeah, okay, but you're mentioning something else that's also quite valuable. It's not me, it's not mine. Those old memories don't belong to me. I'm making myself miserable by owning that stuff. Here's an example of it. We've got a dog here that was bitten by a snake a couple of months ago, and she's doing fine, but the area that was in the worst case burst open, and she's got a gaping wound on her hip. A friend comes by and he is squeamish. He sees me sticking my finger in it and putting salve in that open wound and, okay, why do we do that? Is because we see that open wound is mine. That's me that's opened, okay? When we see someone else being stabbed, we don't like it because we put ourselves in me. Into it. I don't like being stabbed, therefore I don't like seeing other people getting stabbed. Another one would be identifying with a political party, and every time that political party gets something good, we feel good, and every time the political party loses something, we feel bad. Not remembering that political parties are up and down, up and down, all day long. And here we go, every time we hear something good, we feel good, and every time we hear something bad, we feel bad. We're on a roller coaster because we identify and attach to things that don't belong to us. Like going to the football game and we see the guy on the field running this touchdown and he feels really happy and half the people in the stadium are jumping for joy because they identify with him. This is my football team, he is my player. And the other side of the stands, they're dejected because they have the same thing. Oh, it's the other team that is mine, and so my team is being harmed by this guy making the touchdown. So we can come to become completely neutral to sports because they're not mine. Let those guys play if they want to play. Let them run all over the field and spike balls and do whatever they want to do, but it's not me, it's not mine. Nothing is worth identifying as I, me, or mine. Now you use the word disassociation. That means that you're already associated with it. That's the Mahayana method, looking at the Dukkha. A much better way of saying it is, that's not mine. I never associated with it, so why should I disassociate with it? I'm not associating with it, and I'm proving to myself I've got nothing to do with it. It's not mine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I kind of just presuppose that the craving is there and you have to solve the problem of the craving, or like of the grasping.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to solve the problem, it's only that you see it and make a choice. Change. The Second Noble Truth is greed, ill will, and delusion. The delusion is, is that I should be attached, I should like it. And when we come out of that delusion through the practice here of Anapanasati, of coming out of those hindrances— not mine, don't belong to me, I'm good without it, I'm okay, I'm already all right, I can feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied no matter what happens because it don't belong to me. Nothing belongs to me. Even your body doesn't belong to you. Jesus mentions that you can't change your stature one whit. Another way of looking at it is that old people want to be young and young people want to be old, and everybody's dissatisfied. The age they actually are. And yet they can't change their age, they can't change things. And actually, there's a word for it, this referred to as narcissism, because of an old myth in Greek mythology of where the guy was in love with the way that he looks. And so women are taught to be narcissistic. To change the way that they look, put on rouge, put on makeup, fix your hair, do something to make yourself look better so that you'll feel better. Yeah, we're in fact, you could just feel better and it doesn't matter the way you look. In fact, the monks, because of other circumstances like mirrors being really valuable, the monks didn't have mirrors in the time of the Buddha. And now the modern monks, they don't bother. So in that sense, you could say that, well, if I'm ugly, that's other people's problems. They're the ones that have to look at me. The only time that I see I'm ugly is when I look in the mirror, and I don't look in the mirror. If I don't look in the mirror, I don't look at it. It doesn't matter whether I'm Anagami or not, or the body is ugly or not, because the body is not me, not mine. And so back to that point about ignorance or delusion, that if we can wake up to our greed, we can say, "Oh, that's just a hindrance. Let me throw that out and be satisfied and happy right now. Let me be comfortable now." And we have to practice that over and over again because those old dysfunctions, those old dissatisfactions, those old attachments will come back, and if we can see them, we can say, "Out, out! I'm happy now. Don't bother me with your trivia." So that's the real practice of the Buddha, and getting ourselves into that state of, "Wow, this is really great." is the key. That's all we need is to get ourselves back into a state of I'm okay, everything is fine. The body is ugly, but I'm happy. The body is getting old, but I'm happy. The body is sick, but I'm still happy. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually says that when you're sick, when you're old and sick, that's a really good time to practice. But most people, when they're sick, "Oh, I couldn't bother meditating, I feel so bad." When in fact that's the best time to meditate. "Oh, I feel so good." That in fact we can begin to control the body in a psychosomatic way to bring ourselves out of our tiredness, to bring ourselves out of our sickness, with the thoughts that are wholesome, rather than, "Oh, poor me," which is an unwholesome thought. We can have wholesome thoughts about, "Don't bother me, it's okay that the body is sick.".

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, I mean, it's a different— it's definitely a totally different like perspective.

**Speaker A:** It's the Buddhist perspective, but it's profound, difficult to see, hard for people to understand. And you go away and practice, and then you'll forget to practice over and over again. You'll forget. That you don't remember, but you have to practice remembering. That in fact, this is why the Buddha gives the option of mindfulness of breathing in long and mindfulness of breathing out long, because every breath that you take then is two points of Sati. To remember that this is a long breath, to remember to relax, keep practicing to remember to do that with the mind also. And over time, the body that is comfortable, relaxed, safe, secure, and the mind that is relaxed, comfortable, safe, and secure will kind of gang up on the feelings, what's called a pincer movement. They'll grab them like this and close in on on them, and pretty soon we begin to feel safe, secure, comfortable. Even for an old practitioner, it only takes half a minute or so to come out of our anxiety, come out of our worries, and come back into everything's okay, everything is fine, no problems, no worries.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Can you practice that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I already have. Well, I've tried based on like other instructions that you and other people have given. I would say, yeah, I mean, it.

**Speaker A:** Kind of.

**Speaker B:** It works while it's working. And then I do find myself getting like dragged into everyday activities. To the point where I like, uh, kind of, you know, it's not like I'm like practicing.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but can you remember to change that and drag yourself back out.

**Speaker B:** When.

**Speaker A:** You are buried under the woes and the problems of life? Can you say, hot dog, I don't need to do that, I can sit here and be happy instead?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for the most part, yeah. I mean, like what I do for my career requires a lot of high-level mental processing where it's not like, I kind of need to get absorbed in what I'm doing. And I notice that after, especially if I do it for like 3 or 4 hours without really stopping, when I come out of it, I'm in the very kind of like tense, kind of like craving-oriented state. And it takes me a while to come out of it, like probably an hour or so.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you're not practicing it. If you practice it, it wouldn't take so long. You can say, oh, I'm uptight, I've been working, never mind, I can relax right now and just relax.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you think it's just something that you get better at over time if you practice more?

**Speaker A:** Well, it's a skill to be developed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just like people who learn to play a musical instrument, they have to put the effort in, and they start making music, but they have to keep putting effort in it, and pretty soon they get one piece memorized, one piece of music that they can play. And so they become satisfied with that, and then they'll play more. Most students who ever take piano lessons and quit within a year or two is because they don't like it. So you have to get yourself into a state of liking to practice Anapanasati. And in fact, I would highly, highly recommend to take the word meditation out of it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because meditation has the connotation of doing something to get something, to doing a lot of work they get little results over a long period of time. But Anapanasati is instant gratification. Instant, at least in the sense of 30 seconds.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, recognize that you like doing it, that you like telling yourself everything is okay, everything teaching is fine. You like remembering to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I do like it, so I don't have an issue with that. Yeah, I don't have an issue with that.

**Speaker A:** But you can see the value and the benefit. I mean, right now we're just still at an intellectual level. But when you actually get the experience of, wow, this is good, when it actually feels good, then you know you're making progress.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I tried it earlier this morning, and I would say I got to the kind of tranquility stage. After like 5 minutes or 5 to 7 minutes or something like that, right?

**Speaker A:** Doesn't take long even for those who are unskilled at it, 5 minutes, 10 minutes at the most. But as you develop the skill, it's going to be 5 or 10 seconds. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you're saying that, and you were saying that you don't really see much value in necessarily trying to keep yourself in kind of like formal, a formal sitting, in that state, in a formal sitting sense for more than 10 or 15 minutes. But beyond that, it's just like spinning your wheels.

**Speaker A:** The mind gets dull. It's not so bright, but we can't tell it. I mean, if you were flying in the airplane and you're in the thick of the fog or the clouds, you don't know what speed you're going. You have to look at the ground and get some sort of reference. And that's the mind too. The mind can get dull and drowsy, and we don't even know that it's dull and drowsy because we don't have any reference.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so it's better to be alert. It's better to be awake, mindful, paying attention, making a change.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. Yeah, so I mean, I guess what, what is there to do really? Just, I can keep practicing it like a few times a day.

**Speaker A:** Um, is every time that you can remember, and you can have triggers. We'll talk about some triggers the next time that we talk. Yeah. All right, but every time that you remember you can take a deep breath. I mean, you've watched me on this video, and dozens of times I've taken a deep breath and just relaxed. And I noticed that all the time I'm talking about breathing and relaxing, I haven't seen you do it yet.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I have. I mean, I have a bit, but I think maybe not enough. Super.

**Speaker A:** The way to tell is by, are your shoulders rising? Are you taking a deep enough breath? So that the shoulders will rise and then fall with the out-breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll do it now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, let's do that now with the thoughts: everything is okay, easygoing. Ah, just relax, relax with that out-breath. Breath. And then the mind will wander away. Never mind, come back, start again, start again. And when the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. We don't have to fuss at ourselves, "Oh, we lost it." Just remember to come back and start again, to make a change.

**Speaker B:** And in like kind of more formal practice, would you say like the— it's better to do the, the longer breaths? Because I mean, you see different teachers say like a lot of teachers say don't do longer breaths at all, right? Um, a lot like this, the sutta seems to say that like you do, like you start with long breaths and then you, and then you shift to short breaths and watch the short breaths as well. Would you say for now just do only long breaths, like in the formal?

**Speaker A:** Until you have a direct, long, strong habit.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. It's like, why choose? Why switch musical instruments if you haven't even learned the first one?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker A:** This is a skill, the training. Then in fact there's reasons for the short breath, and that would be when you really need it. You need the effort, you need the energy, you need it right away. Get the body really energized, tingly alive. But you can get that tingly alive with the long breath also.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** To make yourself feel really good But what most people do is that they stop. They stop watching the breath. They get high and then they like it, and then they forget about it and the mind wanders away, just like is what happened to you. You broke out into speech when you could have been having a.

**Speaker B:** Ball.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way that we practice, and we'll get some anchors and some other things the next time. So I would recommend that when we finish this video, go practice right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks.

**Speaker A:** See you, and see you in a couple of days or next week or whenever. But go practice, get some success, find that you really like doing this. Everything is all right, no problems. Wow, everything is okay. I'm satisfied. Okay, cool.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right, thanks for the time.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student (Speaker B), presents a radical critique of common meditation approaches and advocates for a direct, simple path to happiness based on the Buddha's core teachings. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: Stop Analyzing Dukkha, Cultivate Sukha (Happiness) Now**
The central argument is that mainstream "goal-oriented" meditation (exemplified by Mahasi-style Vipassana and Western psychology) is flawed. It focuses on dissecting dissatisfaction (dukkha), which is like digging through garbage or being a pack rat. This process itself is dukkha and perpetuates the cycle of striving and suffering.

The true Buddhist path is **immediate**: recognize unwholesome states (hindrances) and **immediately replace them** with wholesome, happy, and relaxed states. The goal is not a distant attainment but learning the skill of being "safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied" in the present moment.

### **Key Contrasts Presented**

| **Common (Faulty) Approach** | **Dhammarato's Recommended Approach** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Goal:** Achieve enlightenment/freedom in the future. | **Goal:** Be happy and satisfied right now. |
| **Method:** Analyze dukkha, break down hindrances, do "psychological archaeology." | **Method:** See a hindrance (worry, craving, restlessness) and **immediately discard it**. |
| **Mindset:** Postponed gratification, striving, self-improvement project. | **Mindset:** Instant gratification. Choose satisfaction now. "I'm okay, everything is fine." |
| **Metaphor:** A football player seeking the next touchdown (short-lived high). A chef digging through trash. A person buried under a pile of dirt, clawing out. | **Metaphor:** Taking out the trash immediately. Sitting on top of your pile of dirt (your world). |
| **View of Jhana:** A distant attainment to be reached after hard work. | **View of Jhana:** The first jhana *is* this state of happiness free from hindrances, to be cultivated now. |
| **Practice:** Long, arduous formal sits, dissecting experience. | **Practice:** Short, frequent "tune-ins" throughout the day. Use the breath to relax and gladden the mind. |

### **Essential Practices Taught**
1.  **Recognize & Remove Hindrances:** The five hindrances (sense desire, ill-will, restlessness, sloth, doubt) are not for analysis. They are "jail." See them and "get out of jail free" by shifting attention.
2.  **Cultivate Wholesome Thoughts:** Actively substitute anxious or craving thoughts with thoughts of safety, comfort, and satisfaction. "Everything is okay right now."
3.  **Use the Breath as a Tool:** Practice Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing) not as a strict concentration exercise but as a way to **gladden the mind and relax the body**. A deep breath with relaxed shoulders is a physical trigger for a mental shift.
4.  **Start at the "End":** Don't follow the 16-stage insight maps that begin with misery. Start at the supramundane stage—the Noble Eightfold Path—right now. Make the choice to change your mind state.
5.  **Develop the Skill of Satisfaction (Sukha):** The ultimate aim is to develop the skill of being satisfied regardless of circumstances. This skill builds confidence (saddhā).

### **Critiques of Other Systems**
*   **Mahasi/Vipassana:** Criticized for making dukkha the object, leading practitioners on a long, painful path of analysis.
*   **Western Psychology/Psychoanalysis:** Dismissed as "psychological archaeology" that digs up the past without enabling real change in the present.
*   **Goal-Oriented Spirituality:** All striving for attainments (even jhanas or magga phala) is seen as a subtle form of craving. If you are truly happy now, what else do you need?

### **Practical Advice Given**
*   **Formal Practice:** Can be short (5-15 minutes). The aim is to reach a tranquil, happy state quickly, not to endure long sessions.
*   **Informal Practice:** The real training is to remember to apply this "look and change" method dozens of times throughout the day—when working, driving, or feeling stressed.
*   **On "Disidentification":** Don't *dis-identify* from suffering (which implies you were identified). Instead, **never identify with it in the first place**. See thoughts and feelings as "not me, not mine."
*   **Simple Instruction:** When you notice the mind in an unwholesome state, take a deep breath, relax the body, and consciously think, "I am safe. Everything is okay. I am satisfied." Repeat as needed.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a passionate plea for simplicity and immediacy in practice. It argues that the Buddha's path is about a profound **change of attitude**—from seeking happiness in achievements or future freedom to **choosing satisfaction in the present moment** by consistently abandoning hindrances and cultivating wholesome mind states. The path is "excessively simple" but requires persistent practice to become a skilled habit.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, Speaker A (the teacher, likely Dhammarato) uses several vivid **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching: that one should immediately abandon unwholesome thoughts (hindrances) and cultivate a happy, relaxed, and satisfied state instead of analyzing or dwelling on dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **1. The Football Player (or Goal-Oriented Achiever)**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the fleeting, addictive, and ultimately unsatisfactory nature of goal-driven, achievement-oriented states.
*   **How it's used:** The football player makes a touchdown, spikes the ball, and feels a momentary high, but soon has to do it all over again to feel good. This is compared to being stuck in a cycle of craving and temporary gratification, which is distinct from the stable happiness found in practice (like the first *jhana*).

### **2. The Tree Root System**
*   **Purpose:** To debunk the idea that our suffering (*dukkha*) has deep, buried roots that need extensive psychoanalysis.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker A explains that a giant tree's roots are mostly shallow, spreading wide just under the surface—they don't go deep. Similarly, our unwholesome thoughts and *dukkha* are not buried deep in the past; they arise on the surface of the mind as habits. Therefore, we don't need to "dig" deep; we just need to recognize and discard them when they surface.

### **3. The Pack Rat**
*   **Purpose:** To criticize the meditative approach of analyzing and dissecting every negative thought.
*   **How it's used:** Most people are "pack rats" of the mind, storing every old grievance and thought ("maybe I'll need this someday"). The Mahasi-style practice of dissecting *dukkha* is likened to a chef digging through the garbage bin to see if anything valuable was thrown away, instead of just mindfully taking out the trash.

### **4. The Emperor Buried Under a Pile of Dirt**
*   **Purpose:** To frame the choice in spiritual practice.
*   **How it's used:** Everyone is the emperor of their own world (their mind), but most are buried under a "pile of dirt" — their accumulated worries, past traumas, and unwholesome thoughts. Some practices (like analytical *vipassana* or therapy) are like trying to claw your way out from under the pile. The proposed alternative is a simple attitude change: stop identifying with the dirt and just sit on top of the pile as the emperor.

### **5. The Journey of a Thousand Miles**
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that the practice is simple but requires continuous, repeated application.
*   **How it's used:** While the first step is simple, you must keep taking steps. The practice is about making a change in the mind "right now," and then doing it again in the next "now," and the next. It's a simple action that must be relentlessly repeated.

### **6. The Leaky Pipe**
*   **Purpose:** To stress the importance of early recognition and intervention with unwholesome thoughts.
*   **How it's used:** If you catch a leak early, it's easy to fix. If you ignore it until the pipe bursts, you have a flood and a major repair. Similarly, if you catch a hindrance (like anxiety) early, it's easy to let go. If you let it develop, it becomes a much bigger problem.

### **7. The Psychologist's Joke (Archaeological Psychology)**
*   **Purpose:** To mock the Western therapeutic (and by extension, some meditation) approach of digging into the past.
*   **How it's used:** The story of a man who, in therapy, remembers his mother spanking him at age four. The therapist says this explains why he's an "asshole." The punchline is that the mother likely spanked him *because* he was being an asshole at age four. The "archaeology" is pointless and misses the present habit pattern.

### **8. The Dog's Wound & Political Identification**
*   **Purpose:** To explain suffering caused by identification and ownership ("I, me, mine").
*   **How it's used:**
    *   We can calmly treat our own dog's gaping wound because we see it as "ours" and necessary. A stranger might be squeamish because they don't have that identification.
    *   People feel elated or dejected based on their political team's wins or losses because they identify with it ("my team"). The rollercoaster of emotion comes from attaching to what is "not self."
*   **Link:** This ties to the advice of "disidentification," but Speaker A reframes it: don't *dis*identify from something you've claimed; instead, learn to see that it was **never yours to begin with**.

### **9. Flying in Fog (Dullness in Meditation)**
*   **Purpose:** To explain why long, formal sitting can become counterproductive.
*   **How it's used:** When a plane flies in thick fog, the pilot loses all reference for speed and position. Similarly, if the mind becomes dull and drowsy in meditation, you lose the clear reference point of alert awareness. It's better to practice in shorter, brighter, more alert sessions.

### **10. Learning a Musical Instrument**
*   **Purpose:** To frame the practice as a skill requiring enjoyable repetition.
*   **How it's used:** One must practice the basics (like long breaths) repeatedly until they are mastered, just as a musician practices scales before moving to complex pieces. If you don't enjoy the practice itself, you'll quit (like people who quit piano lessons).

### **Overall Rhetorical Strategy:**
Speaker A consistently uses **contrasting metaphors**:
*   **Football high vs. Stable *jhana* happiness** (temporary vs. reliable).
*   **Digging through garbage vs. Taking out the trash** (analyzing vs. discarding).
*   **Clawing out from under dirt vs. Sitting on top as emperor** (struggling vs. claiming sovereignty).
*   **Archaeological digging vs. Present-moment change** (past-oriented vs. now-oriented).

These stories and metaphors serve to make the abstract Buddhist concepts (*dukkha*, hindrances, *anapanasati*, right effort) concrete, memorable, and persuasive, while sharply criticizing alternative meditation approaches the speaker views as ineffective.
