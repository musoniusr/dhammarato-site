### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so Christa, you've been reading some of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and asking questions about breathing. The first thing that we can notice is that whether we get the exact details or not, that the important thing is that breathing is important. That's the basic point. And that many meditation systems miss the power of the breathing and the power of the knowledge of the breath and the power of the let us say, dealing with, learning, and then learning to control the breath. And that this is a very powerful process because the breathing itself is directly related to emotions. An example of that is freezing with fear fear, and that when we freeze, we actually stop breathing. That's what freezing is all about. And so generally, when we're in fear, we're not breathing very well. And yet that mechanism of the freeze is also a preliminary step to fight and fright. So that also means that there's a lot of chemical stuff going on inside the body that has to do with what's going on in the mind and in the feelings. That basically these things are really interconnected, and learning about each one of them individually will then help us to see how they are interconnected. Now, when we are little kids, little children pay a lot of attention to the body. They've got to learn to control it. Generally up to a point, so that the kid can learn to stand up and walk around. In some societies, they have to learn to throw and catch. In another society, that's forbidden. But generally, it's a lot of motor skills, and many of those things are kind of painful. So what happens is that we as children get diverted then from the kind of playfulness that incorporates the use of the body into intellectual things that are associated with school. And then they kind of separate recess from school, and take the children out of their body and put them into ABCs, 123s, put them on a desk, put them into books. And then we, in paying attention to that, as we grow up into adulthood, many of the kids don't pay much attention to their body at all. The only two examples, or three examples, would be children who go to art school, children who are in musical classes, or those that are involved with sports. They still have body, but that leaves quite a lot of kids out. They don't do anything with their body. And so as an adult, the body seems to be one of the forgotten elements. And so bringing the body back into our awareness so that we can start to live in the body and begin to watch and monitor the breathing, which means that this actually, the body now, is the doorway back into reality, is the doorway back into this present moment. And we pass through doorway into the here-now by coming then out of our conceptualized world that we've been constructing and living in. And so coming to the body then is actually something that we're going to be doing that's bringing us back into reality, the reality of this present moment. Because when we're thinking about the past, even if it's 5 minutes ago, or thinking about something that needs to to be done tomorrow, or thinking about, let us say, politics or sports or something that's happening in another country or another city, or that happened last week or next week. All of these are conceptualizations. They're not what's happening in the here-now. And that our Western society, our capitalistic society, is actually very conceptually oriented. And that part of that conceptually oriented, in the sense that we live in concepts or ideas or how things should be instead of living in the world, and much of that conceptualized world is actually critical thinking. The critical thinking which means this is good, this is bad, that's great, that's terrible, I like this, I don't like that. That in fact we could say that that part of the mind, the critical part of the mind, is original sin. Now I'm kind of playing with words when I say the original sin, because the guys who talk about original sin, they generally refer to Adam and Eve, right? And Adam and Eve invented critical thinking, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that is the whole story, right? Yeah, they became self-aware and started thinking about their thinking of too much, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, they had to eat of the— now, and to eat of the fruit. Now, eating of the fruit means having to put up with the results. That fruit often is referred to as a result, like the fruit that we have from a plant is the fruit of the plant, or the result of the plant, or the gift of the plant. And so we also use that word like the fruit of the loom, the fruit of the loin, the fruit of labor. So we're using the word fruit that way, and yet the Christians have been looking for a literal fruit. They've been looking for apples and bananas, they think, right? To where the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil means that we have to put up with our critical thinking. And here they are, Adam and Eve, living in paradise, and they go around criticizing it. I like that tree, but I don't like that one. And when we start to criticize paradise, what we start to do— like this tree, I live in paradise here, but this tree's got a yellow leaf on it and I don't like yellow leaves, so I'm going to pull that tree up. And if I keep doing that, I'm going to literally destroy the paradise without just losing it in my own mind. Okay, so this is basically what's going on, is to come back into the paradise. And the way that we do that is by bringing the body through the door first, literally. And so Starting to pay attention to the body, we begin to slowly come to understand that, "Hey man, the body is actually working, it's doing its job. Let me start to appreciate actually how marvelous this human body is." We begin to start to breathe and play with it and expand the lungs and drop the diaphragm and raise the shoulders, doing all of that on an in-breath. And then as we breathe an out-breath, it's like an empty bag or balloon, the air comes out of it just— And so this is the kind of breathing then that relaxed, slowed down, but not forced at all. That in fact, if you start to force it, then we're not practicing correctly. And one of the ways of knowing that we're forcing the breath is because we get tired and we don't like it. But if you're practicing breathing well, then you actually enjoy every breath, allowing it to be, let us say, life-giving, because that's what the breathing is. And as we breathe out, we also put out a lot of chemicals as an exchange. Much of it is carbon dioxide, but there's a lot of other stuff that comes out in the air. You know that, by the way, that carbon dioxide itself has no odor, right? And there are odors that come from bacteria in the mouth, but there are other odors that come right out of the lungs. And that stuff that comes out of the lungs is actually other kinds of poisons, broken up amino acids and things like this. And yet when we're breathing shallowly or normally, a lot of that stuff just stays accumulated in there. So taking longer breaths allow a better exchange of air so that we're getting in more oxygen and throwing out more waste products. So that would be kind of the scientific approach to what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is actually talking about.

**Speaker B:** Well, this whole week I've caught myself quite a few times, so I felt pretty good about that, and I immediately took a breath and it felt great. I mean, every time I did that, that was— it was just a really nice feeling, you know.

**Speaker A:** So Yes, you know, you start to remember it often. Also, this is a skill that is to be developed, and we use breathing in order to develop the skill of Sati. And Sati is the skill of remembering. And yet in the West, we have the idea that we have to watch the breath continuously. And if the mind wanders away from the breath, we've done something wrong, and we start to fuss at ourselves rather than understanding, no, this is just the way that the mind works. And that if the mind does wander away from the breath, just never mind, just take a nice deep new breath and really enjoy it. But regular people will start to fuss at themselves, oh, you haven't been watching your breath.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think I kind of understand where that's coming from because when I read that book or pamphlet or whatever, it was essentially saying that eventually the mind will attach to the breath. So it's probably the thing of I'm not there yet, right?

**Speaker A:** I mean, I guess actually it's a little bit backwards. It's not that the mind by itself attaches to the breath. The intention and the task is to attach to the breath. Okay. All right. And that another way of saying it, rather than attach to the breath, we're going to use it in the sense of learning to control the breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And what I mean by controlling the breath, that means that we're actually putting some skin in the game. An example of that is that you probably kibitzed or watched a child or some friend play a video game, and the person who's actually playing that video game has got skin in the game. He's got his hand on the mouse or whatever with the machine, and he's really into it, while the spectator can get distracted easily while the game goes on. Arahant. This is how most people practice Anapanasati, as if they were a spectator watching the breathing happening, but at least as if something else was doing the breathing, like somebody else is playing a video game and all we're doing is watching it. Okay, so one of the ways then of understanding this more clearly is that you've got to put some skin in the game. You got to do that effort. You've got to put some effort into it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And, um, the effort kind of comes in two styles, but there is an effort that's needed to actually control the breath. If you're actually just watching the breath, it's very easy for the mind to just watch something else. And because of free association, the mind will wander away from the breath easily. But if we're intentionally controlling it and intentionally liking it, then by controlling it and liking it and paying attention to it and inspecting it, the mind will actually stay on the breath more. That's what you were referring to as attachment, and I'm referring to it now more of curiosity interest and the ability to manipulate it, control it, work with it, uh, play with it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that does work. Your, your whole brightening of the mind thing, I kind of tried that with the breath thing because I've heard you say, ah, that was a nice breath. So I, I've, I did that and that, that really works. It does keep my mind on the breath a lot longer than it would. My mind does eventually wander off, but I'm like, oh, there it goes. So I try to bring it back I can do another breath and, you know, just, you know, talk myself into feeling good about the breathing in and the breathing out. And it works. That really works.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it does. It's an old technique, been around for a long, long time, but it needs to be discussed correctly because it's easy to misunderstand because of language and translations and also the Western mind, um, uh, it's a little bit foreign as concepts, as foreign concepts. So, um, learning to do it correctly, uh, is often making sure that we're getting the right directions in the first place, right? All right, so putting some skin in the game, putting some effort into it and learning to control the breath, we can look at it like this: that if we're taking the effort actually to make some changes rather than just observing and letting it be, by putting some skin in the game, we actually learn to control the breathing only because we're actually learning to control the mind. That we learn to control the mind at the same time, and in that process This is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, which is a little bit later in that book, will mention about gladdening the mind. But when he mentions gladdening the mind, he will kind of say, but this is the first thing that you need to do. And when I say the first thing, I'm not talking about the first year of practice or the first month of practice. I'm talking about the first thing that we do when we wake up. Okay, at that instant that we want to change the shape, the condition of the mind, and that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa uses the kind of the standard translation is done in English using the word gladden, but we can also use the word brightening the mind. And what we mean by that also is making sure that the thoughts that we're having are wholesome thoughts, because most of the time our thoughts are either unwholesome or junk thoughts. And we don't have a lot of time spent having intentionally wholesome thoughts. So the wholesome thoughts go right along then with the wholesome breathing. And having wholesome thoughts while wholesome breathing, we're beginning to take control of the situation. And when we add the third ingredient of feelings, so that we actually not just tell ourselves how wonderful it is and feel the air and the breath and that, we actually begin to feel how nice things are. This is kind of like the one-two punch of learning to control the body and learning to control the thoughts will allow us to learn to control our feelings. By basically talking ourselves into feeling good while we feel good in the body, and that allows us to feel good emotionally. And when we can get that going, that's actually gathering together the Jhana factors so that we make the mind fit for work. We're getting the body energized through the breathing, we're cleaning out the pollution both in the blood and also in the thoughts.

**Speaker B:** When you say fit for work, what do you mean by that? What work?

**Speaker A:** Um, actually, that's a very interesting thing. I would go so far as in a joking, friendly opening salvo saying making the mind fit for work. And the work to do is the noting that they talk about in the Mahasi Method. And yet, and yet the Mahasi Method, they don't go through the stages of getting the mind fit for work. They just start with a mind unfit for work and give it the job to do. Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I remember you saying that several times, that, you know, you're noting stuff, but you're noting a lot of garbage and you need to clear that out first, right, before the noting begins, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes, and then so the job that we have to do now is to note or to pay attention to things that happen one by one as they occur. But in this regard, because we've gotten the mind completely wholesome, what we actually now have to note or what to look at or what to figure out is what the mind is like when it's functioning correctly.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or how the mind actually works, because at other times then we can see, oh, that means that I should not go and do that because that's going to take the mind out of a functioning working condition into Dukkha. Which is unsatisfactory. So when the mind is working correctly, when the mind is fit for work, that means the results are going to be satisfactory. And when we're doing things when the mind is not fit for work, means the results are probably going to be unsatisfactory.

**Speaker B:** Right. I don't think I've gotten to that point yet. I mean, I'm working on it though. Um, I'm noticing more things. That's definitely happening, and I'm, and I'm pulling myself out of that. So I mean, I'm— I got that going on.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, um, one of the things then we can understand is, is that everything that you could ever do with meditation, with Anapanasati, you can do it right now. And that in fact, that's the kind of the whole goal, that it is not off into the future, which is rather right now. Okay, practicing here correctly right now, and we begin to get the confidence that if I can do it now, I can do it next time. And the next time just happened, and I can I'm doing it again. And if I can do it twice in a row, I can do it again. Okay, and so that doing it in the moment over and over again builds confidence. Doing it with the goal in mind of having a lot of failures along the way, but at least you'll eventually learn how to do it, is a loser's attitude. Okay, the winner's attitude— hot dog, I got it! And this is what we're cultivating, cultivating of the be here now. And whatever we're going to do, let's do it right now, because now is the only moment there is. Anything that was ever done was done in some now.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** But all the plans— look how many plans have been made and they never got a now. And so that's so much for planning for you. That's actually something that I began to understand in the 1970s, was the number of ideas that I had, even excellent ideas, computer programs, database designs, all kinds of stuff. But the number of ideas that I have greatly exceeds the number of ideas that I could possibly put into operation. Some of the ideas that I would have would take a whole staff of people years to accomplish, but it was an idea. I think that we can talk about that in the sense of that our reach is greater than our grasp, that we can reach up and touch things, but we can't get up there to grasp it. All right, so what we're talking about here is that in fact Western psychology, Western capitalism, the Western mentality is to reach for the stars. And the entire teaching of the Buddha is let's get a hold of things, let's grasp what we can grasp. Instead of reaching for things that we can't touch, or if we can touch it but we can't grab it, right? Okay, so this is where we're getting very, very practical. And what we can grasp is this present moment. All we can do is reach for or plan for the future. Getting better at it, as opposed to this is good enough right now, right? Getting better at it is still being dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is, this is a tough part for me because, you know, as you're saying, with the Western world, I mean, most of my life is done through planning. I mean, and it really does have some good practical uses, like if I don't plan out certain things, certain things are not going to happen in my life, which is also going to cause problems for me and my family. So obviously it has some useful parts.

**Speaker A:** It's just that's something you're pointing out something I've heard students also say that kind of thing like that. If I was completely satisfied all the time, I'd never get out of bed. My answer to that is that I'm satisfied and I can get out of bed. I can go find something to do, something that's interesting, something that's worthwhile doing. Okay, so that's kind of the same statement that you're making, and that,

**Speaker B:** um,

**Speaker A:** it's all on a continuum. Maybe the way to talk about it is the middle path. And so when we're talking about being in the present moment and people say, does that mean I can't make any more plans? No, it means that when you're making plans, know that you're making plans and know that you can be making these plans in this present moment, right? That you're still being here now. But most people get lost in their plans, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, no, you're right about that. I've noticed that all week where I'll be focused on one thing and my mind will bring up another thing, and then I, you know, I'll drift off into that until I say, whoa, okay, let's take a breath.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, this is exactly what all of this practice is about, is for you to get to know the mind. But a part of getting to know the mind also is to become friendly with it rather than abusive, because it's not doing what you told it to do, right? Because it's been untrained. It's almost like, um, uh, an owner whipping a puppy because the puppy didn't come fully trained, right? Right. And, and the, and the owner of the dog doesn't bother to train the puppy He just is angry because the puppy's not already trained, like for instance housebroken and stuff like that.

**Speaker B:** Um, I've seen many pet owners do that. That's terrible. Like, like the dog's going to train themselves? Not going to happen. Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, the mind is not going to train itself either. It's just not going to happen, right? And part of that training that we do with dogs, the professionals, those who really know how to do the dog training, every time the dog does something correctly, it's rewarded. Okay, so in Anapanasati, that means that every time that you're practicing correctly, part of that practice should be that you reward yourself. You nurture yourself, you comfort yourself, you actually get yourself into a nice state and then recognize that you're in a nice state and congratulate yourself for getting into a nice state. Okay, this is the part that's gladdening the mind. To gladden the mind means actually in a way of treating the mind as opposed to being critical with it. 'You should do this, you should do that,' etc. So we're looking for coming out of the critical mind-state into a nurturing mind-state. We can think of it actually as a parent, that Eric Berne talks about it in the sense of the parent, the adult, and the child ego-states. And the parent ego-state is where we have all the ways that change should be, the parenting. But there's two kinds of parenting: one is the critical parenting, and then the other is the nurturing parenting. And basically it happens this way: when a child is born, they start off being nurtured. A tender infant will not survive if it's not nurtured. But somewhere between 4 and 6 years old, depending upon the society and other individual factors, Everything changes for that child. He no longer is in a warm, nurturing environment being taken care of. Now he's mommy's little helper. He's a first grader. Up 2, 3, 4, learn your ABCs, do your 1, 2, 3s, learn to read, clean your room, put your cell phone down, do your homework. You know the 9 yards of that one. Okay. And so we are literally trained out of being nurtured and being nurturing into being, let us say, a cog in the wheel. And now in meditation, in Anapanasati, we're going to start reversing that process and coming out of that critical mind that we've learned, because we turn that on. I mean, it's okay to be critical of the world. But we turn that on our inside and we start being critical of ourselves on the inside. We often become our own worst enemy, literally, not because of making foolish decisions, because we're treating ourselves inside with the thoughts we have critically. Okay, and so now the actual practice is to take that effort to change, literally change the way that we're thinking, or change the kind of thoughts that we're having. And we want to change and have the new thoughts that are actually associated with what we're doing in the present moment. And for many people, with the way that we're practicing intentionally, the only thing we're doing is breathing. So let's pay attention to that. Okay, this is what we're going to put our focus or awareness, rather than in the past or into the future, We're just going to be here now and have thoughts that are nurturing thoughts, nurturing ourselves right now, like, wow, I can relax. Wow, there is nothing to do. Well, this is the job well done. That in fact, we need to look at life right now is when we take an out-breath and that sigh and the throwing out of the unwholesome thoughts. That can be considered now the job well done. The job that needed to be done has been done, and we can relax knowing and complimenting ourselves for having done a good job just now. And what was that job? Throwing unwholesome critical thoughts out and nurturing. And in fact, congratulations and saying a job well done. —that's nurturing. Saying, "Oh no, you've got more work to do"—that's critical. And we spend far too much time in critical thinking and not much time in nurturing thinking. And if we get into practice, we spend far more time in nurturing thinking and less time in critical thinking, and we're a whole lot happier and we still get everything done. And so this is the whole point about one's right effort. This is part of the Eightfold Noble Path. But in fact, we can go back to that is Sati is to remember, and we want to develop that skill. Well, it's kind of funny like that, because it's remembering or waking up is the skill to be developed, then in order to wake up or order to remember, that means that we have to come out of being asleep. Right? Okay, wake up. Or to remember means that we're coming out of a state of forgetfulness. That's the standard state. The mind is like that all the time, and yet meditators, when they see that their Sati comes, and they remember, they start to hate themselves for the fact that before they remembered, they were in a state of forgottenness. You're not supposed to forget. Yes, you are, because the skill that we're developing is the skill to wake back up. The normal state of mind is in fact an instinctual state of mind. That's our default position. And that one of the ways of thinking about that is that the frontal cortex is kind of like a supercomputer, and it takes a whole lot more energy, a whole lot more effort, as it were. And we need that extra oxygen in order to oxygenate and get the front part of the brain going. And when it doesn't function correctly because it's not— it's either actually been exercised beyond the point, or it's not getting enough oxygen. And then we use the word tired, and we all— and generally people go around their whole lives kind of in a state of tired. But by breathing well, we begin to energize the body, begin to energize the blood which means we begin to energize that frontal cortex also so that it can be woken up and put to good use for a short period of time, and then it's going to go back asleep again. You probably heard that people use about 10% of their brain. That's an old saw. A better way to say that is, no, everybody knows how to use their own mind completely to full capacity. They only do it about 10% of the time, right? And the rest of the time we're on automatic pilot, right? And so we want to practice coming out of automatic pilot and turning the lights on. So basically, instead of focusing on the light itself, we're going to start focusing on flipping that switch. To turn it on. That's the Sati we want to develop. Sati is the skill to remember, so that when we're out in life, whenever something happens, we want to have Sati to come up so that we can handle the situation wisely, rather than handling the situation instinctively. Okay, so basically, instead of having this 10% of the time on and off, just haphazardly, We're actually going to train the mind so that we can turn it on when we need it, turn it on when we want it, but allow it to be off like it normally is. And yet in meditation, a lot of people go around hating themselves because they have to keep turning it on. They expect that once they turn that light off, that light on, it's going to stay on. And it doesn't happen that way. The mind doesn't work like that. It goes back to a default position. And that part of the brain, by the way, is functioning all the time. The frontal cortex is just on and off. So we can see that with the EKGs and whatnot, but we also can understand that if the whole brain went to sleep at night, you'd stop breathing and die, right? Your heart would stop beating. No, there's something going on there that's there all the time. But it's a very, very low-class primitive function. It's almost like when the computer is just sitting in idle, it's actually just down in the base of the operating system, just sort of doing a few instructions, waiting for an interrupt. Okay. And then when the interrupt happens, now we got to go process that interrupt, and that may then start an application. So this is the way that we're looking at the mind is in kind of an idle state quite often, and that we want to develop the ability to turn it on, and to turn it on, and to turn it on, and to turn it on. So this is the Sati that we're developing, is the turning it on, or the waking up to be here now. Okay, and so there is absolutely no reason for anyone to wake up and then feel bad because they had just caught themselves asleep. That makes no sense, and yet every meditator does that. But Goenka talks about it in the sense that when the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind that it wandered away from the breath, just come back and start again. But normally what happens when the mind wanders away from the breath and the student sees that, they have a pity party. Oh no, poor me, I wandered away from my breath again. This is so hard. This is terrible. Maybe this is not a good instructor, or maybe this is not the right time for a meditation, or all kinds of excuses come up. And while they're having all of those thoughts, guess what? They're still not practicing. They're just telling themselves what a failure they are. We have to watch for that so that when the mind does wake up, we can say, "Hot dog, glad to see you, boy," instead of saying, "Where have you been?" Because "where have you been" is critical. "Hot dog, I'm glad to see you," that's nurturing.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this nurturing quality of nurturing the mind, of saying everything is okay, everything Everything is fine. What a wonderful day. What a wonderful world. This is no place to go, nothing to do, everything's all right, everything's fine, not a worry in the world. These are wholesome thoughts that almost like you sing yourself a lullaby to wake up. Instead of singing ourselves in the childhood lullabies to go to sleep by. But basically, when we sing a child a lullaby, what that does is that puts the child into a state of safety and security. That's what we're looking for, is to get ourselves feeling safe and secure. So the kind of things that we can talk about is, "Hot dog, there's no alligators on the floor." There's no crocodiles, there's no spiders coming from the ceiling, there's no tarantulas on the keyboard. Everything's all right, nothing dangerous here, and I can feel safe. Why is it, do you think, that in Western civilization that fear seems to be the guiding principle behind everything? We built a society to come out of the jungle, so that we could feel safe in our homes, in our cities, in our high-rises. Because out in the jungle, it's a jungle out there. Except what we've actually built is concrete jungles. And the reason for that is because we took the boy out of the jungle, but we didn't take jungle, out of the boy. And so even though we have humans living in cities, they still have— they're terrorized as if they were still in the jungle. And many of them create their own jungle. So now that you're in that room, that room that you're in, it looks like it's very safe. It's not on fire. That's pretty nice that we sit here and feel in insecure and not safe, when the reality is, is that things are right now very safe, right? So this is something that we can do with that, is, is to talk yourself into feeling safe and secure, because you actually are safe and secure.

**Speaker B:** Now, is it okay to say that to yourself in specific?

**Speaker A:** So if something pops up specifically— yes, everything about a person You know, you

**Speaker B:** could say that person's not even here right now. I'm here by myself.

**Speaker A:** Not here, right? He's not dangerous because he's not here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, nothing to worry about with that right this second, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Yes. And, and you can tell yourself that the way that you would tell a child that is frightened.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Hey, there's no alligators here. Let's go look in the bed. There's, there's, um, under the bed there are no foxes. In the closet, there are no bears. And so we can finally just sit here and feel safe and secure. If we can feel safe and secure, the next level then would be comfortable. But this is a major, major point, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa really, really understood it. And we even run the meditation retreats with this principle, that the student must be comfortable as well as feeling safe and secure in order for the student to feel satisfied. It's hard to feel satisfied when you're uncomfortable. It's really hard to be satisfied when you're terrified. And so, working at that level first— and by the way, these things, safety, security, comfort, comfort and satisfaction are actually parts of the definitions of the Pali word Sukkha. When you look it up in the Pali dictionary, these are items that you find on the list, as well as these are items that you find in the Idyapada, which actually the word idya is the same word that you've heard before in Sanskrit of Siddhis, magical powers. Well, there actually are real and that the real powers are the feeling of security, the feeling of safety, the feeling that you're on top of this, the feeling of a winner, positive attitude. That attitude, in fact, is so powerful. "I can do it" is the winner's attitude. And he's much more likely to be successful than the one who says, well, I'm not sure I can do it. I don't know. I'm afraid. I don't think I can do this. Okay, that's not a powerful position. So this definition of the word Sukkha, the word Sukkha actually is the exact opposite of the word Dukkha, and not only in the Pali, but it's exact opposites in the Thai language. And one of my students who has— his parents are Gujarati, which is an area of India that's actually in the Northwest. In that language, Dukkha and Sukkha are opposites, where Dukkha means trouble, unsatisfactory, unhappy, and Sukkha means comfortable, secure, satisfied. So if we are in fact in a state of Sukkhi or Sukkha, then that means by definition of the word that we're not in Dukkha. That's the Third Noble Truth. The Third Noble Truth is to come out of our dissatisfaction and become satisfied. The satisfaction is actually the primary skill to be developed And looking at it in the sense that it's a skill to be developed, that means that you have to have satisfaction, some of it, a little bit, in order to develop it. So it's much better to have a tiny little bit of satisfaction, but a lot of students are saying, I'm not satisfied with a little satisfaction, I want a lot. I don't want to feel just a little bit, I want I want to feel really good, and so I'm dissatisfied with feeling good. I want better. You see, that's critical thinking. But finding something that you can be satisfied with is the place to start. And then when we get that satisfaction, we can begin to let it— intentionally let it grow. Like, wow, really, I really am satisfied. Wow, this is nice. I really do like this. Okay, so we work on becoming satisfied, which actually is the Third Noble Truth, because the First Noble Truth, Dukkha, means that we're dissatisfied. The cause of dissatisfaction is because of critical thinking. When we start having nurturing thinking and come out of the critical thinking, then that Third Noble Truth is that we can be in a state of satisfaction. We can be free from unsatisfactory life. And the method to do that is the Eightfold Noble Method, which is Sati, right view, the right effort to change our thought from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. And with that knowledge of doing it over and over and over again builds confidence. Which is the fourth item on the list, which is Samma Sanghappa is the Pali word, and it's translated sometimes as right thought, sometimes as right intention, but a better translation for it is I have the right attitude. And you can understand that right attitude actually is the basis of right thought in the sense that if you have a certain kind of attitude, you're going to have thoughts that are associated with that attitude. If you have an attitude that's different, then your thoughts are going to be different. An example of that is a 15-round prize fight has just finished, and one of them won and the other one lost. One of them's got his hands in the air and the other one is on the floor face down with a pool of blood. Okay, that's the scene. Fast forward 10 minutes. And each one of these guys is getting a massage. And while he's laying on the massage table, each one of them is going to have, let us say, a particular kind of thought, like it's time to retire. All right, so that's the context. Is the guy who won the fight going to have the same thoughts about retirement as the guy who lost the fight? Nope. Ah, no. The attitude of that winner changes the way that we think, right? So this is where we've got to change the way that we look at things, change the way that we actually see the world, which is this new attitude. And the attitude is the attitude of 'I can do this.' The attitude is, is 'I can wake up. I can. I can do this anytime that I want to. I can wake up and see how things really are. I don't have to stay asleep in my instinctual automatic pilot. And as you know, people retreat to their instinctual automatic pilot oftentimes because it's too much work or too much effort to actually look to see what's going on. An example of that is people who listen to, say, Fox News, and they hear a particular viewpoint and they get all afraid and everything. They don't then go do the research necessary to find out that what they've been just told was a lie and that it's making people afraid intentionally. They will just operate out of that fear. Yep, we become kind of blind, dumb animals. We go along to get along. This is instinctual. It's called the herding instinct or the nesting instinct, that we do what we're told to do. That in fact, the nesting instinct that each human has as part of his internal programming writ large becomes our society. Society is nothing but the nest that humans have built out of the planet Earth.

**Speaker B:** And I mean, a lot of these things are group survival strategies, I assume, right? I mean, it's— and they work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, to an extent. Yes, they are group survival strategies that maybe are overly used because things are not always a survival issue.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, that's what That's what fear is all about. Fear makes it a survival issue, when in fact it wasn't a survival issue at all. The Texas Legislature somehow sees that it's their survival issue to keep people from voting. That it's a survival issue if they can't control every teenage girl's visit to the doctor. Okay, this is— but it's not a survival issue. That's delusional. But the delusions are not worked out through research. They're dealt with emotionally, with fear. Right. Okay, so basically what the whole teaching of the Buddha is, is to wake up and do the investigation that we need to do in this present moment to figure out that nothing's here to fear. And people will watch the internet, they'll watch Fox, they'll watch YouTube or whatever like that, and get really afraid and filled with fear and develop attitudes and go and do things when they could have turned that video off and taken a deep breath and say, I don't need to worry about that, that's not my problem, right? People in Idaho, they can actually recognize that Texas is not their problem. Politics is not my problem. There's enough people out there in politics and they're all over fussing and fighting. Do you think they need me in there fussing and fighting with them? Right. Better to stay out of politics because there's a lot of fussing and fighting and a whole lot of terrorizing and terrorism and terror going on in all of that. So recognizing and seeing that, it's best to avoid politics until we can dabble in it without it let us say, sticking to our fingers, that we can literally become above it. Whatever happens in politics, not my problem. If people did have that problem, they would have a whole lot less fears and worries. But everybody's in America, I mean, they work really hard to tell people, you got to vote, you got to put skin in this game, you've got to go do this. I mean, those libs are absolutely terrible people, or on the other side, those Republicans are absolutely terrible people. We can't let them be in charge of our lives, you know. And in fact, both sides are equally screwing everything up anyway, so it doesn't really matter who runs the place. The best thing to do is to stand aside.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMARATO] Especially on a national level.

**Speaker A:** Well, then we begin to see that if that's true at that conceptualized level, because actually if you think about it, when you and I are sitting here talking about politics, we're only actually talking about concepts. And that when a Republican talks about politics in a certain concept, he's going to have different language than the Democrat who is talking politics in concepts. And we can conceptualize anything. So if we can conceptualize anything, one of the things that you could do is to stop conceptualizing things for a while and pay attention to what's actually going on, especially in this moment. So this is what Anapanasati is all about, is to come out of that critical thinking, conceptualized thinking, thinking about politics, thinking about politicians, thinking about money, thinking about all that kind of stuff, and to start thinking about, let us say, the limits that are real. One of the limits that's actually real is, is that right now your whole world is in that room because you cannot see through walls, right? Another way of looking at it is your whole world is right right there in that chair. So all you have to do is just think about what's in your whole world, and that whole world sitting there in that chair,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** And, and the other stuff that we would say would be the world out there is actually a world in here. There's no world out there. The only world that we actually have is the world of our own senses. That's our world. Everything else is a mentally constructed thing.

**Speaker B:** Well, through my investigations over the last couple of weeks, I've noticed there's been— I don't watch TV, so I mean, that's not a big issue for me. But I do notice that a lot of the thoughts that I've seen and caught involve kind of escaping the moment, the present moment. You know, there's a lot of, uh, let's try to get away from this present moment, even though, I mean, like you said, the present moment's usually pretty good, like 90% of the time. But it seems that a lot of, a lot of my time is spent trying to get away from that pretty good moment right there, to go somewhere else or to get some excitement or whatever, you know.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Right, so that's that conceptualized mind. And so the point now is to remember to wake up out of that, right? Say, hot dog, I don't have to think about Aunt Susie, I don't have to think about George Bush, I don't have to think about Putin, I don't have to think about Donald Trump, I don't have to think about my taxes, I don't have to think about fixing the car, I don't have to think about anything right now. I can just sit here and relax. And very few people spend time doing that on a regular basis, to stop doing all of the doing and just sit and enjoy the moment. Many people practice meditation to get something out of it in the future, rather than recognizing, no, the practice of meditation is you sit here and you get all the benefits you're going to get that you can get right here, right now, knowing that in the process of doing that, you're actually developing skills so that it can only get better and better, and you can just remember more and more often.

**Speaker B:** Well, and then I assume you can start applying that, what that feeling to when you actually are doing things, right? Because I have the same problem when I do things, is that while I'm doing them, I'm thinking about the next thing I'm going to be doing,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** Never doing the thing I'm doing. I'm always thinking about the next thing

**Speaker A:** I'm doing, which means that you're not actually doing what you are doing now to the very best of your ability, right? Because you're doing what you're doing now with half your ability, and the other half of the ability is planning on the next job that you're only going to do half-assed. Right, right. There's a lot going on with that. In the Bible, there is a passage that whatever thy hand findeth to do, do with all thy mind, all thy strength, and all thy heart. Have you heard that passage?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yep, yep.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. All right, this is basically what we're talking about. So normally in operations, when we're out doing something in the world We're only half paying attention to it, but we're out there doing it. And most of what's going on is we don't like it. We would rather be doing that that we're thinking about rather than doing what we're doing right now. So here we are doing something, but we don't like it. We're not enjoying it. And that's our style of life anyway. The right thing to do is to get out of that, to come into seclusion, to get the mind really fit for work. Get it, get the mind really in a good state—happy, wholesome, investigative—and then we can bring that kind of mind back to the task at hand and get it done happily. Now it's also possible that while we're getting that job done happily, we wind up going back into—I don't like it, and we recognize that waking up, "Oh, I don't like this job right now," not this very moment, like say I'm halfway into an email and I get writer's block, or I'm stopped or whatever like that, and I come to pause to a point of, "I used to like writing this email, right now I don't." So the thing to do is to come back into seclusion, get the mind into a really, really good state again, and when you're your mind is really, really fit for work and very happy and willing to go. Now we can go back and finish that task and do it well. Okay, and so getting the mind fit for work means that now we can in fact put it to work. But most people, they say, oh, I can't get time, I don't have time to get the mind ready for work, I got to go do the work and I'm going to have to go do it unready. How many Olympic stars win a gold medal in the Olympics without any training at all?

**Speaker B:** None. None.

**Speaker A:** Does not happen. And yet how many people are out there trying to get the job done and they've got no training?

**Speaker B:** Everybody.

**Speaker A:** Everybody. All right. And so a job well done actually means that a job is is most likely going to be well done when the mind is fit for work. And if you don't like doing that job, your mind's not fit to do it, right? Getting the mind fit for work means that you're eager to do that work, that you like doing that work, that you're willing to do that work. Let me at it! Hold my beer! You know, this is, this is the attitude. And so it's not that we would stop doing everything, but rather over time with wisdom we begin to now look at things that we are doing with a wiser position of, wait a minute, was it really worth the effort to do that? Are there not better ways to do things? But that would be the third item on the list.

**Speaker B:** List.

**Speaker A:** The first item on the list is to get the mind fit for work. The second one, then apply that mind to the kind of work that we need to do in this moment. And then the third one is, now that we have the mind really fit for work, can we find other work that the mind is fit to do, and that work is even more fit than the work that I was doing?

**Speaker B:** That's interesting. Yes,

**Speaker A:** but the important point is to get the mind fit for work by getting the breathing going, by getting the attitude changed, by getting the mind gladdened to put out the right kind of effort, to know that the right effort— this is all the stuff on the Eightfold Noble Path and And basically what that means is that when we're practicing correctly, the mind is fit to work is a mind that's in that Third Noble Truth.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, not the First Noble Truth. Normally we do our work when the mind is still have Dukkha in it, and we can actually get all the work that needs to be done happily. Right. So I hope that this kind of clears up the question about the breathing and Sati and that it's okay to forget because what we're building up is the skill to remember.

**Speaker B:** Yep, very helpful. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're All the talks that you've had with me, plus everything I've listened to, has really opened my eyes to quite a few things. And I feel like I'm making some progress here.

**Speaker A:** So actually, don't think about making progress. Think about enjoying this moment. This moment is good enough. It doesn't have to be compared to the last moment or the next moment. That right now, this is good.

**Speaker B:** You're right. Yep, you're right.

**Speaker A:** Get yourself into that good state. I'll give you one last little story, and that is, have you ever heard of Pilgrim's Progress?

**Speaker B:** I've heard of it, but I never read it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the whole concept of a pilgrim is that he is in a journey to get to a holy site. My question to you is, what happens when the pilgrim gets to the holy site? Is he still a pilgrim? Is he still making progress getting to the holy site, or has he actually arrived at the holy site?

**Speaker B:** He's arrived, I guess, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay, so if he remains a pilgrim doing progress, that means he's got to leave this holy site and go off on a journey to go find another holy holy site, right? But this one was good enough. And in fact, we've got a whole lot of pilgrims like that. That's what a real pilgrimage is, is moving from one holy site to another holy site to another holy site, right? Okay, well, if you find yourself in a holy site, why would you want to make any further progress? Because to make progress now means you have to leave the holy place that you're in. So why not we just get ourselves into a really nice holy state, completely whole, and then we arrive? Now we don't have to make any more progress.

**Speaker B:** No more traveling needed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no traveling needed. Just sit down and relax because you're already in a holy place, right? This The present moment is all the holy we need.

**Speaker B:** That's good,

**Speaker A:** Christopher. This has been delightful. I really enjoyed it. In fact, this hour has just flown by zip.

**Speaker B:** Yep, it always goes quick when I was talking with you. I really appreciate your time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, will you continue on? Continue practice one moment at a time to wake up, to change the mind, to take a deep breath and enjoy the heck out of it. I will.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Take care.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye.

**Speaker A:** Oh, by the way, have you, uh, uh, uh We're doing some, um, actually Skype group calls on Saturdays and Sundays in the UK, uh, on Sunday, and, uh, the US. I'll send you a link.

**Speaker B:** I saw— yeah, yeah, I think you put up a link for me for the UK one, but I'm in the US. I don't have the US one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll send you one for the US also. That's going to be tomorrow night. I think it's Thursday. Wait a minute, today, today here is Friday morning, so it should be Thursday night, uh, there. So tomorrow night.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so Friday night US, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Friday night US, depending on the time zone. 7 Pacific and 10 Eastern.

**Speaker B:** Okay, good. Yeah, I can be on there. That'd be great.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't have the link for that one. I do have the UK one, but that's, that's way too early. That's like 4 AM or something. My time.

**Speaker A:** So right after this call is finished, I'll send you the link.

**Speaker B:** Great, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Alrighty, we'll see you, Chris. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friend Christa (Speaker B), is a practical guide to meditation centered on **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and reorienting one's life to the present moment. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### **Core Theme: Breathing as the Doorway to the Present**
*   The breath is powerfully connected to our emotional and mental states (e.g., fear disrupts breathing).
*   Modern life and education pull us into conceptual thinking, away from bodily awareness. Returning to the breath is a "doorway back into reality"—the present moment.

### **Key Practice Instructions**
1.  **Active, Not Passive:** Don't just *watch* the breath like a spectator. "Put skin in the game" by gently **controlling and playing with the breath**. Make it relaxed, enjoyable, and life-giving.
2.  **Gladden/Brighten the Mind:** Actively cultivate wholesome, nurturing thoughts about the breath and your current state (e.g., "This is a nice breath," "I am safe right now"). This is the antidote to our default mode of critical thinking.
3.  **Skill of Remembering (Sati):** The goal isn't to maintain unbroken focus. The mind's nature is to wander. **Sati is the skill of "waking up"** when you've forgotten. Each time you remember, celebrate it ("Hot dog!") instead of criticizing yourself.
4.  **Make the Mind "Fit for Work":** The sequence is:
    *   First, use breath and nurturing thoughts to create a mind that is **happy, wholesome, energized, and fit for work** (this is the Third Noble Truth—satisfaction, *sukkha*).
    *   *Then*, apply that fit mind to any task, fully engaged in the present.
    *   With wisdom, you can then evaluate if the tasks themselves are worthwhile.

### **Philosophical & Psychological Insights**
*   **Critical Thinking as "Original Sin":** Dhammarato reframes the Biblical story: eating the fruit of knowledge of good/evil represents the birth of critical thinking, which destroys our innate "paradise" (peace with the present moment).
*   **From Critical to Nurturing Mind:** We are trained from childhood to be critical (of the world and ourselves). Meditation reverses this by cultivating a **nurturing inner parent** who rewards and comforts us for being present.
*   **The "Holy Site" is Now:** He critiques the perpetual self-improvement mindset ("pilgrim's progress"). True practice is about **arriving fully in the present moment**, which is already "holy" and good enough. Practice for the benefits *now*, not for a future goal.
*   **Conceptual vs. Real World:** Politics, news, and most worries exist in a **conceptualized world**. Your direct sensory experience—the room you're in, the chair you're on—is your actual world. Meditation is about returning to that.

### **Practical Outcomes**
*   **Break the Cycle of Dissatisfaction:** We often try to escape the present moment even when it's perfectly fine. The practice builds the ability to **"sit here and relax"** without needing to go elsewhere mentally.
*   **Confidence Through Immediate Success:** The point is to succeed **right now**. If you can cultivate a good state in this moment, you build the confidence that you can do it again.
*   **Apply to Daily Life:** A mind made "fit for work" through meditation can then engage daily tasks with full attention and enjoyment, rather than doing them half-heartedly while planning the next thing.

In essence, the talk is a compassionate guide to using the breath to break free from the critical, conceptual mind, to nurture oneself into a state of present-moment safety and satisfaction, and to engage life from that place of wholeness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Body as a Doorway:** The body (and specifically the breath) is described as "the doorway back into reality," the passage from our conceptualized world into the present "here-now."
2.  **"Skin in the Game":** Used to contrast active, intentional control of the breath (like playing a video game) with passive observation (like watching someone else play). It emphasizes the need for personal effort and engagement.
3.  **The Mind as a Puppy/Dog:** The untrained mind is compared to an untrained puppy. It's counterproductive and cruel to get angry at it for not being trained; instead, one must patiently and rewardingly train it.
4.  **The Mind as a Light Switch:** Sati (mindfulness/remembering) is compared to the skill of flipping a switch to turn on a light (awareness). The goal isn't to keep the light permanently on, but to develop the reliable skill of turning it on when needed.
5.  **The Mind as a Computer/Operating System:**
    *   The frontal cortex is likened to a powerful but energy-intensive "supercomputer" that needs oxygen (from good breathing) to function.
    *   The default, instinctual state of mind is compared to a computer in "idle" or in its "base operating system," just processing basic instructions and waiting for an interrupt (a trigger for awareness).
6.  **Reach vs. Grasp:** Western striving is described as "reach[ing] for the stars" (always seeking more), while the Buddha's teaching is about learning to "grasp what we can grasp"—namely, the satisfactions available in the present moment.
7.  **The "One-Two Punch":** Refers to the combined practice of controlling the body/breath and controlling thoughts to master feelings.
8.  **"Concrete Jungles":** Describes modern society as having physically removed us from the natural jungle, but failing to remove the fearful, survivalist "jungle" mentality from inside us.
9.  **Society as a Nest:** Human society is described as the "nest that humans have built out of the planet Earth," stemming from an instinctual "nesting instinct."
10. **Pollution/Cleaning:** Shallow breathing leaves "waste products" and "poisons" accumulated, while deep breathing "clean[s] out the pollution both in the blood and also in the thoughts."

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **Adam and Eve & "Original Sin":** The story is reinterpreted. Eating the "fruit of the knowledge of good and evil" is presented as the invention of **critical thinking**—the tendency to label things good/bad, like/dislike. This critical mind is what destroys our inner "paradise."
2.  **The Boxer After the Fight:** The story of two boxers (one winner, one loser) both thinking "it's time to retire" ten minutes after a fight is used to illustrate how our **attitude** (winner vs. loser) fundamentally shapes the nature of our thoughts, even if the conceptual thought is the same.
3.  **The Child's Lullaby:** The practice of "gladdening the mind" with nurturing thoughts is compared to singing a lullaby to a child. However, the purpose is flipped: instead of putting the child to sleep, these "lullabies" for the mind create a sense of safety and security that *awakens* it to the present.
4.  **Checking for Monsters:** The speaker suggests talking to oneself like a parent reassuring a frightened child: looking under the bed for foxes, in the closet for bears, and declaring "there's no alligators on the floor" to cultivate a felt sense of present-moment safety.
5.  **The Olympic Athlete:** Used to highlight the absurdity of trying to do important life tasks with an untrained mind. Just as no one wins an Olympic gold without training, we shouldn't expect to perform well in life without training our minds to be "fit for work."
6.  **Pilgrim's Progress:** The classic allegory is referenced to make a point about goal-oriented practice. If a pilgrim is always *progressing toward* a holy site, they never *arrive*. The metaphor argues that we should seek to *arrive* in the "holy site" of the present moment and stop "traveling" in search of a future achievement.

### **Recurring Conceptual Frameworks (used metaphorically)**
*   **Critical Parent vs. Nurturing Parent:** Borrowed from Eric Berne's Transactional Analysis theory, this framework is used to describe two internal modes: the critical, fault-finding mind vs. the encouraging, comforting mind. Meditation is framed as strengthening the nurturing parent.
*   **Fit for Work:** This is a central analogy for the goal of initial meditation practice. The mind must be made "fit for work" (calm, happy, wholesome, energized) through breath and attitude *before* it can effectively do the "work" of clear observation (noting) or skillful daily action.

These metaphors and stories collectively build a case for moving from a critical, conceptual, future-oriented mind to a nurtured, present-moment-aware, and satisfied one, using the breath as the primary tool.
