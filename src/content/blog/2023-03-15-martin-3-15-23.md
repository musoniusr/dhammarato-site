### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So that you can repeat that. Okay, because that's really important. In fact, it's really good for you to say it to others so that they can hear it and recognize that they say it to themselves too. That that's one of the trainings that we get in this society, is the need to know. Yes, supposed to know, and if we don't know, we're supposed to guess. Yes, that in fact this is how religion got started. You can imagine sitting around the campfire about hundreds of, maybe hundreds of thousands of years ago, and some kid says, points to the sky, points to a star and says, what's that, Uncle Jimmy? Now Uncle Jimmy is on the spot. He's supposed to know, and so he can come up with any kind of story at all. And when that kid repeats it often enough, it becomes a religion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's so hard to say sometimes, I realize how hard it is to just say, "I don't know." Sometimes I'm lying, even lying to say something, and sometimes I just have to say, "I don't know.".

**Speaker A:** I don't know. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that in fact we actually need to become comfortable in being in that state of not knowing, that in fact ignorance, knowing and not knowing, is all over the Dhamma, in the sense of the cause of suffering, the Second Noble Truth, the cause of suffering is ignorance. We don't know. But it is a kind of a special context there, in the sense of what we don't know is we don't know that greed leads to Dukkha. We don't know that ill will leads to Dukkha. We think in fact that being angry leads to safety, where in fact it never does. It always leads to more danger. And so we're ignorant that way, but that's almost like an innocent ignorance because there's a really more profound ignorance, and that is that once we make up a story about something, that becomes our new fact. And so when we tell ourselves a story, especially over and over again, that story gets ground in. And it becomes then very quickly delusion or denial, okay? Because the reality doesn't fit my story, I'm going to take the story because it's more comfortable, because I'm used to it. And then that means that we don't actually like to be in a state of not knowing. Another word for that would be the word doubt. We don't like to be in the state of doubt, perplexity, confusion. It's an uncomfortable state, so we don't like it. And so we will make up anything in order to plug in the holes so that we feel better. So on that starry night when Uncle George or whoever is asked the question about the stars, he feels uncomfortable. He's on the spot. He's been asked a question he doesn't know, and he's already gotten the position that he's supposed to know everything. He's the big uncle in the tribe. And so being on the spot, he makes something up. And all the kids see him do that, and they learn to make stuff up too. And then generations later, here we see mom and dad making stuff up, and we think it's okay to make stuff up. And then in fact, we're supposed to make up stuff. We're not supposed to be unsure and in doubt, even if that's the reality.

**Speaker B:** And sometimes you make something up, and then because you think it's important, but like week after you realize it doesn't matter. In fact, it's really empty. It's like an empty desire because you think it's important. I have to know, I have to know. But sometime next week I realize that I even don't remember.

**Speaker A:** But I forgot about it. It doesn't matter anymore. I don't feel— yes. Yes, that in fact you could see how that's actually crept into our educational system just in my lifetime. In the old days, an examination was almost like an essay, or you had to actually write something. You had to actually answer the questions, and often the questions were long and involved. I remember, in fact, one of the exams that I got back from a professor. This, by the way, ancient history, and I remember it well because I got an A-minus with a note of, 'Just answer the questions, don't tell me everything you know.' All right, so that's the point. That's the kind of idea that we get into, is that the more information we add to the answer to the question, then the more complete the question is, to where often we become irrelevant. So the point is then, that modern test-taking, they've changed it from an essay, or a long drawn-out question with a long drawn-out answer, they ask multiple choice questions, which invite the kids then to guess. You see, if you don't know the answer for an essay question, then it doesn't matter what kind of crap you write down, the teacher's going to know that. But in a multiple choice test, you might guess right, so why not? So that's part of the reason why our culture requires us— that in fact, they even require us to hold opinions about things. That you're supposed to make a decision about political parties or governments or nationalities or patriotism, or you got to make a choice about the church, you got to make a choice about your religion, you got to make choices here, there, and the other place. But almost always these kind of choices are based in ignorance, guessing. And when we guess wrong and say the wrong guess over and over again, we begin to own it as if it were ours. Here's a kind of a strange example of that. One of the reasons why in meditation retreats they instruct you not to talk to other students, especially about your meditation, is because someone will have an experience And they think that experience is something, and so they'll go tell somebody that experience. But then when they tell it, they tell it as a story, and that's what the mind matches on to. So now if I tell somebody in the retreat about that experience, 5 years from now when I remember that experience, I'll remember the story, not the actual experience. That we tell ourselves stories, and that's what gives the delusion. That starts up the delusional cycle, is the stories. Rather than leaving it unspoken, unsaid, and just leaving it there, we have to tell ourselves a story about it, which creates the delusion, and then we get attached to that delusion. Now here's something very interesting about the training that I had from Ajahn Po was that he was fond of appearing to me in a kind of surprising way. One of the things he would do is he'd go stand in front of the kuti that I was in. I don't know how long, but he would stand there until I would come out. Whatever it was, it would come out. Maybe he was mentally calling me, I don't know. But again to become watchful, that that's actually part of the watching training that we don't get in Western Buddhism. We think that it's all about meditation, and meditation is about concentration, and concentration really is nothing but getting drowsy, etc., like that. And we often associate words like concentration with Samadhi, but really Samatha means that the mind is organized and complete and whole. So while concentration removes things, often important things, Samadhi brings everything together. The example is like a yurt, or I'll use the example of a Western teepee. Western Americans, they had out on the plains, they lived in a house called a teepee. That for little children, they'll have 4 poles, but really big teepees will have 20 or 30 poles on them. But one of the things about all the teepees is that the poles are tied off close to one end. That you can call the Samadhi point, where everything comes together and is bound together. And then you take the other end of each pole and spread them out, and that's what gives stability. That if those poles were not tied together at the top, they'd fall apart into a crowd.

**Speaker B:** Is that the single-pointedness they talk about in the Dhamma?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, except that single-pointedness is like kind of a thought, to where what we're talking about here in Samadhi is that the various parts of the brain, or the various ego states, are functioning together in friendship, as opposed to having an idea, "Oh, I need to go to town," "Oh, I don't want to go to town," "Oh, you've got to go buy this," I don't want to do that. And so we get into arguments with ourselves, especially with this other thing about we need to know, we have to make a decision, we have to come. And so we get into an internal argument about it so that we can come to a conclusion, because we feel comfortable when we've decided that— let us say that we haven't decided whether I'm going to go to town or not. Because of that, I'm insecure. I don't know whether I'm going to go to town or not. I haven't made up my mind about it. But in the process, I'm going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. I'm not unified. But if I make a decision, no, I'm not going to go to town, or yes, I am going to town, that brings us into a state of unity. Now I've made my choice, I've made a decision. I might change it later, but at least I feel comfortable that I've come to a resting place.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now what the Buddha is actually teaching and what Achan Po worked with me was that he would come by from time to time, just close enough that he could speak in a normal voice or in a whisper even. To get my attention, that it really was kind of a cat and mouse game that he was playing with me. This was because he didn't have much English. This was part of the teaching, was to wake me up to be here now. And one of the things that he would say would be the English words 'not sure.' Can you imagine just standing there and some magical creature in your mind just walks behind you and says, 'Not sure'? And then walks right on off. And he said, oh, there he is over there now. Okay. And, and Ajahn Po said that to me many, many times. The other one that he would use would be tatatha. And tatatha means to be here now.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Tathagata means thusness, means here-ness, means wake up. I just snuck up on you and you didn't even know I was here. Right? That's what we're talking about. Being in the present moment means being in our sensory awareness as opposed to being in our thought process, daydreaming. And most of the Westerners, we spend all of our time daydreaming.

**Speaker B:** When I'm practicing, I'm trying to have wholesome thought, and I found difficult to have wholesome thought, you know, talking thought in my head, like everything is okay, I'm relaxed. And also be aware of my surroundings.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, this is the skill set that we're developing. Okay, this requires practice. It requires practice to begin to have wholesome thoughts, that in fact, the wholesome thoughts is the very beginning, and it's also the most important. And here's why. It's the basic training of the mind. The basic training of the mind is to come out of our dreams and do something useful instead, the wholesome thoughts. So, we could say then that the analogy that I use is, imagine that there is a wild horse, a stallion, and that he roams all over the place, except that he can unwisely get himself caught in a box canyon, He can fall into a ravine, he could fall into a thicket, he can get caught and captured and whatnot like that. And so it's dangerous out there. So what we could do for our horse is put him in a pasture. Now, a pasture is a large field that has really good things to eat that horses like, and he will be safe in that pasture so long as he doesn't jump the fence and go out into the wilderness. Okay, so we can actually think of then is having wholesome thoughts one after another is for us to keep our pony brain in the pasture, in the pleasant place where there's lots of stuff to eat and interesting things happening and all of that, but it's also safe, it's not dangerous. And so we begin to then fence in the mind into the wholesome. And then the next process would be that in order to train this pony, this horse, we have to first corral him. And so we take it out of the pasture into the corral, which is like, oh, 10 meters by 10 meters, something like that, maybe even smaller, maybe 5 or 6 meters by 5 or 6 meters. In that regard, we can do that with the mind, and the way that we can do it is by taking an object. And in Tibet, we would have maybe a tongpa, or the monks might take a chant, or we can take a song and do it over and over and over again. Now that really corrals the mind, it keeps it in a small place. And then if we need to do any medical work with the horse, we can't keep him in the corral. We have to put him in a stall where he can't move around, very little place to go. So that then would— we would call it a Mantra. When we can get a Mantra going, that means that we've taken it out of the— and see, most people, they come right out of the wilderness into the Mantra They can't do it. They don't have the skills. So we have to move the wild pony mind out of the wilderness.

**Speaker B:** I can't see you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're free. You're frozen. You can still hear me.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we have to learn to move the pony mind out of the wilderness into the pasture. And so long as it goes back out in the wilderness, we have to catch it and bring it back to the pasture. This is the first part of the training.

**Speaker B:** And does that what you're seeing, the those kind of steps, what is the time frame? It's like something you do each time, or is it something that goes along?

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's the thing, that for much of your career you're going to start off with the horse out in the wild again. So the very first thing we have to do is to start bringing it back into the wholesome thoughts. But eventually we'll get good enough to where we can keep mostly wholesome thoughts. And so it's really easy to move it out of the wild back into the pasture. And so that's the place that we start. Then in fact, the pasture is where the first Jhana is defined, because there's more to do. Okay, that we— in fact, we were talking about Samadhi a moment ago. Versus concentration, that there are several things that we need to get together in order to get the mind unified and organized. We have to work with the body, the feelings, the mind, and eventually the mind's objects. So we're going to bring the Satipatthana together in our practice. Another way of talking about it then is that you have been talking yourself into feeling bad your whole life. Now it's time to start talking ourselves into feeling good. Also, we have not been paying much attention to the breathing. Only a few people pay much attention to the breathing— some sportsmen, some musicians, but only a few. And so what we need to do in our practice is start paying attention to what the body is doing, paying attention to what the breathing is doing, and paying attention to the body and the sensations of the body as they reflect to the feelings that we have. Because the feelings and the sensations are very closely related. Some sensations we naturally like and other sensations we naturally don't like. Not many people really love and enjoy the experience of a mosquito biting them, sticking it in, drawing the blood, leaving a whelp and leaving off, very few of us say, "Thank you! Wow, that was really good!" No, generally we don't like it, so the body then— and we started not liking the body when we were 2 years old, when we were beginning to walk. Only a few people really enjoy and like the body that they're in, like accomplished dancers, some musicians, sometimes even sports people. They really, really like and enjoy the body, but most people, we try to forget all about the body. But in fact, our primary way of spending mind moments is either drawing pictures or telling stories. It's very, very much like a television set, and all we're seeing is the visual and hearing the auditory, where in fact we don't even smell the smoke that's coming from behind the television because it's actually on fire. You see, we're not paying attention except to the primary two of the visual and the auditory. But part of the practice for Anapanasati, and that I've seen that because of other experiences that I've had with psychology and everything, that a lot of the teaching of the Buddha is to help us to come out of our mind, which means come out of our visual, come out of our auditory, and start spending more mind moments with the body, to start paying attention to the body. So these wholesome thoughts that we're starting to talk about can be best seen as thoughts about the here-now, where the body is, because the body is in the here-now. The mind is often someplace else, like in Chicago, or maybe back in 1840, or maybe back into childhood or whatever. But the mind is just all over the place, where the reality is that the body is here now. And so when we're paying attention to the body, the thoughts that we have about the body are mostly thoughts about the here-now. That's the right direction for us to go in. So that we begin to spend more wholesome thoughts with the body. And when we get very good at it, we can just watch the body and its various things without having to talk to ourselves very much about it. Okay, back in the 1930s, when they had radio but no television, they would have a lot of sports on the radio. Baseball and boxing were two of them back in the 1950s. I was actually born in the area before television actually got big, and so radio and whatnot was still quite big in 1950 and '52. In fact, we were the first in the neighborhood to have a television, 1954. So before that time, the boxing would all be done on the radio at what they would call a blow-by-blow description. Except that there is no way that you can give a blow-by-blow description and get every blow in, in real time. There's still a whole lot of stuff happening in that ring that the announcer cannot say. Now, what's happened when television comes in is that the announcers are still sitting in the announcer's booth, but they've got nothing to say because people are watching what's going on. If they are, or they're in a conversation. So this is basically what it means, is that the body and the reality of the body is like the sport event or the play, and that we are often like the person in the audience that's not paying attention because we're thinking about something else. And so that intermediate place is, let's go be the announcer and start giving a blow-by-blow description as best we can of what's happening right now. Become that radio announcer, start watching. Oh, in-breath. Oh, out-breath. Oh, seeing. Oh, I can hear, you know, this is what— oh, cicadas, you know. This is what we begin to do. We begin to get into the present moment, begin to get into the body and stop having so many past discursive thoughts or so many pictures to live in. In fact, we become now feeling-oriented. We begin to pay a whole lot of attention about the way that we feel, but we still have this discursive mind, and we're going to learn to control it so that it has the kind of thoughts to help us be in reality and feel in reality the way that reality wants us to feel, rather than the habit that we're in feeling. This is why we would want to have wholesome thoughts like, wow, that's a good breath, Oh wow, no place to go and nothing to do, and I can just sit here and I can feel my butt on the chair and I can feel my feet on the floor. I can feel the wind on my shoulder, can feel the shirt if I'm wearing one, and just be in the present moment receiving input, being in a state of consciousness. And we need to practice this until we get pretty good at it.

**Speaker B:** Would it be like step 3 of Anapanasati?

**Speaker A:** I would not put Anapanasati in steps. That's in fact the problem. Instead, if we're going to look at steps, let's look at the Eightfold Noble Path because that's really, really laid out well. And there's also the Sambhojana, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. Now, the difference between the Eightfold Noble Path is the Eightfold Noble Path talks about the skills that need to be developed. Thus, one trains oneself. Okay. And the Seven Factors of Enlightenment is the example of that training in its completion and fulfillment. But it's still the same sequence, or almost the same sequence, in the sequence of the Eightfold Noble Path, right view comes first. Why? Because if we got wrong view, we're not even going to practice. So right view comes first, and then we develop the skill of Sati, and as we develop Sati, right view becomes refined. And this is then the practice of the Mahayana method of remembering to look, to note, to see, to wake up. But that's not enough. There's more to the path than just those two things. The third one that we do in order, almost instantly— let us say that we can divide a second into 10 parts. The first tenth of a second is to remember, the second tenth of a second is to look at what's going on, and the third tenth of a second is to make a change. Right effort. Okay, the right effort means to make an improvement, to make a change. And in fact, for most people, it's coming out of the thoughts into the reality of the senses, or coming out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts, or coming out of them, or at least seeing that these are unwholesome thoughts and intending to get rid of them, to throw them out. And the best way to do that is by having wholesome thoughts that have to do with this present moment. So when thoughts are about the past, what happened yesterday, it's possibly, not necessarily, but it's possibly unwholesome. But if you're having thoughts about right now, you've got a better chance of it being a wholesome thought. That most of our fears, most of our dangers are in the past. That in fact, present-day dangers often aren't present-day dangers, they're present-day thoughts about dangers in the past. The reality is, is that we're actually pretty safe right now if we just look at it instead of feeling like we're afraid, because we can make up all kinds of things to be afraid of. And the reality is that there's nothing worthy of being afraid of right now. I could feel peace and relaxation and comfort and joy —if I allow myself to, if I instruct myself to. And in that regard, the mind becomes more unified. Another way of talking about it is that we start having nurturing thoughts as opposed to critical thoughts. Critical thoughts are about, "Oh, I need to adjust my posture," or critical thoughts about, "I wish the bell would ring." our critical thoughts about, "I gotta get out of here," our unwholesome thoughts are basically critical thoughts, trying to find something wrong so that we can fix it and feel better. But if the things are already okay the way that they are, then we don't really need to fix them to feel better, we can just automatically feel better. So what we're going to do instead of going all and doing all of the work, We're just going to tear up the to-do list. Go short-circuit that whole thing. Oh, there's nothing to do and now I can relax. As opposed to, well, I've got this and that to do and then I can relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and sometimes I found it's more complicated because even sometimes what you say, Dhammarato, I sometimes internalize it and I say, I have to do that. Dhammarato said to do that. And when I do that because I think you said that, it's always— I don't know how to say— it's like it's coming from the outside and not from inside. And when it comes from the inside, I can relax and I can have Sukkha even. But when it comes from the outside, it's like I'm doing it because someone asked me to, and I think— You.

**Speaker A:** Made a rule out of it. You're doing it with that, you're doing now with the Dhamma what you've been doing with everything else your whole life, make a rule out of it, oh, you should do this.

**Speaker B:** And that's killing the joy. Honestly, that's— Actually, it's pointing out that.

**Speaker A:** There is no joy. That's what that pointing out is, that's the critical thought, oh, you should do this. Yeah, never mind who you heard it from, but you can put the name Dhammarato. Oh, you heard that from Dhammarato, and now we've made it a rule.

**Speaker B:** Now that's your fault.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now it's my fault, exactly. So when your meditation sucks, it's my fault. I got it.

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna complain. I'm gonna write a complaint to Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right, to the Mahayana Mudra. Exactly, I got it.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** When we can see we're doing that, that's an aha. I see that. I'm glad I see that, because now instead of practicing according to the way that I've been told, I can actually practice happily. Yes, because that happiness has got to be yours anyway, that nobody knows what's going on in the mind of another person. Which means that no one can fix anyone, that everybody's got to do their own changing.

**Speaker B:** And when I remember that, it's so— when I have the Sati of that, it's so much easier to go along with people, even with my wife. Sometimes I realize I'm trying to fix stuff, I'm trying to say, "No, you have to do that, it would be better," but in fact I don't know. I don't have a clue for myself, so—.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's a really, really wholesome thought that you just brought back up. I phrase it differently, in the sense of "not sure," which is different than "I don't know," but really not sure about that. Because if we can accept that we're not sure about anything, that gives us the freedom to be okay without having to collect all of that knowledge. I mean, there's just so much. I mean, have you— give an imagination, then, would be Compton's Encyclopedia or some big one. You know, Webster's got an encyclopedia, 20, 30, 40 books are all like this, okay? And only very rarely will you find someone who can recite the entire encyclopedia? Most people, we don't even have that much. Okay, but guess what? An encyclopedia doesn't even take up 1% of a really, really big library. And in fact, they could have 20 different volumes or 20 different editions of encyclopedias, and it'd still be just over in the corner. The amount of massive, vast human knowledge is completely beyond any one person. And guess what? The amount of human knowledge is growing much faster than any one human being could get smarter. So it's a losing proposition. And yet we all have the feeling that I want to know everything, and that's not possible. The question is, do I know enough? And that's where it comes into— this is why Ajahn Po harped upon that issue of not sure. Because you've already got enough, why should you worry about not knowing this, that, and the other thing? Because you've got enough. Make sure that you've got enough, and then be satisfied with that. And what do we need to know? How to be happy, how to be friendly. And we don't need 99% of Buddhism, that in fact, going back to that encyclopedia, all of the Pali Canon stuck together is much bigger than any encyclopedia set. A whole bookcase full of stuff. Then in fact, uh, um, I think that it's, um, Polytech Society is the only place in the world where you can buy the complete set. And in fact, that's what they want you to do. They don't want to sell individual books, they want to sell a whole set. And it's like $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000. I don't know how much it was years ago. It was $2,000, so I assume it's triple that price now. For the whole. And no one— I mean, they put them in some libraries, they put them in Watson, whatever like that, and no one goes through the whole thing. And yet how many people say, I ought to, I ought to go read the whole thing, I might learn what I need to know. And so we were all— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I know I wanted just to say that it's like, you know, the FOMO The fear of missing out.

**Speaker A:** Say it again.

**Speaker B:** FOMO, F-O-M-O, fear of missing out. It's when you have fear of missing something, maybe it's in the next page, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the fear of missing out, exactly. Let us say that that's a more common point of it. But it all comes from the issue that we're supposed to know. I mean, that's why we're put in school, and that's why they test us. There have been some schools that have been experimenting with letting the students learn without ever giving them a test, to trap them into that position of, "Oh, I've got to know what the teacher is saying." but rather give them the freedom to have fun learning. That's in fact what we often don't have, that when we're supposed to know, then it's not fun. It's almost like fulfilling an obligation. Oh, I was supposed to know that, and then I went and learned it, and so now I know it because I was supposed to know it, rather than relishing how much fun it is to find out something new.

**Speaker B:** Yes, when it comes from the inside. You know, the— you want something from the inside, other than what you say, it's more like a rule, sometimes. You have to know.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, it's based upon feelings in fact. You're talking about it from the inside and the outside, which is almost commonly, the most commonly the way that it's done. But look at it from the perspective of, we do it because we're supposed to know it, which is coming from a criticism, is coming from a one-down place, is coming from an ignorant place. And that when we do it from the position of joy, then it's fun to learn. And so it really is a matter of the feelings. The question is, where did our feelings come from?

**Speaker B:** From?

**Speaker A:** Do we actually have permission to joyously find out something that we don't know, or are we supposed to already know it? Because that's when it becomes a rule, and as you're saying, that rule came from the outside. Dhammarato's rule: you've got to have fun in life. So, when we internalize that, what we actually mean instead is that we change the way we feel about Because we are almost always on the defensive about the outside. The outside has always been the source of all of our dangers and problems. And so, we're not very friendly with each other in society, other than the fact that we're supposed to, and those kind of Rules are breaking down now in politics and otherisms and all of that kind of stuff. But it's still a rule. You're supposed to behave yourself in public. You're not supposed to act the way you feel. You're supposed to act correctly. Right? Well, here's the whole idea of the Buddhism. Why don't we change the way we feel and forget about that rule? Change the way we feel so that we feel good, safe, comfortable, and friendly with our environment, including all of those who come into that environment, as if everything was already okay? And the answer is, is because I'm not sure, I don't know, it might be dangerous. Okay? And the answer is, can you be not sure and still feel safe? That's the issue. Let the doubt be just doubt without having it to have that feeling component of fear. That we conquer that, or we are able to control it. And so we actually relish and have fun with, "I don't know, not sure." And generally it's because it doesn't matter. But in fact, that's the thing: if we're not sure and we don't know, and perhaps there's no evidence at all, then of course it doesn't matter, because it has no effect. An example of that is, is there a God? Well, I'm not sure, nobody is sure. In fact, there are so many definitions of the word God, we're not even sure if we're talking about the same thing. We're just not sure. But some people cannot be comfortable not sure. They've got to make a decision in their mind one way or the other. Definitely there is a God, or definitely there is not one, and that's part of their worldview. But there's a better worldview, and that is to say, well, let's see some evidence. Until then, I don't have to care. I don't know and I don't care. Why? Because it's doing nothing that I should care about. Not only is God that way, but heavens and hells and rebirth and reincarnation and magical powers and all kinds of other stuff that we have no evidence of means that they're all irrelevant. If we have no evidence of it, then instead of wanting it to be true, we could just say, "Not sure, never mind, don't care." But when people have their feelings attached to that, like, "Oh, I'm going to die, I don't want to die," or, "I'll be raised from the dead because I'm a Christian and I'll go to heaven and I won't die, so that makes me feel good," because I don't have to deal with death. But the reality is, we're all going to die. Can you do it happily? Well, play with it. Because in fact, we don't even know what it is. I'm not even sure what death is. We don't know.

**Speaker B:** And also, I found that when you have that attitude of being okay that you don't know everything and that you're not sure. Also, I don't know how to say that, the world is more— there's more wonder, you know, because you look, think more carefully because as you don't know, you look carefully and so there's more wonder in everyday life and in everyday situations, you know, sometimes you would just walk like you used to do because you know that, you know that, you know that tree, you know that tree. But life is like, I don't know, it's not the same that before.

**Speaker A:** It's life, everything is changing, right? So that word that you used, wonderful, we can actually change it back to the original of wonder-filled. This world is filled with wonderful wonders, which means that we don't know. Let's go explore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And let's do so safely. Most people have the wonders, but they're full of trepidation, they're full of fear. And so they're afraid. And so they have to go find out because it's a rule, all you ought to know. And so they go into it through fear rather than through that state of wonder. And this is actually, I would say that that's what Ajahn Po was actually trying to develop when he would say, "Not sure," he was creating the state of wonder.

**Speaker B:** And you know, I'm a composer, and in my work, last before, I was really trying to harness my creativity, you know, to be sure I'm gonna find something good, to be sure I'm gonna find something that works. But nowadays, sometimes I just, I'm just, I find, I find it wonderful that sometimes, boom, it's like that new idea and it's working and it's harmonizing with the other idea, and I don't know where it comes from. And sometimes I really want to know because I want to reproduce it. I want to be able to do it Every time, but sometimes I say, "Hey, that's wonderful, I don't want to make it another rule." In fact, yes, that's the phrase I'm gonna remember, not making a rule.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the analogy that we can use with there is that by trying to trap that creativity, that you're actually closing the door to try to contain it, to where in fact that's the very door that it will come in next. We don't know where the creativity comes from. We're not sure where creativity comes from, but when we stay in that state of wonder and creativity, then creative thoughts will arise. But when you want them, when you're supposed to have them, when you're looking for them, hard to find.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and so I don't know if you have— I'm sure you know, but I'm sure you know the book Zen Archery.

**Speaker A:** Zen and the Art of Archery.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and the Zen master said when he shoots, he said something has shoot, you know. And so I'm trying the same attitude when I'm composing. I love to say something has composed.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and so as the archer shoots the arrow, his job is to do the shooting correctly.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** There's a lot of little details involved with that, including how he holds the bow. An example is pulling the arrow out and notching it while the bow is up. By stretching the bow out, we then release it. The other thing is, is that in Zen, they use these two fingers to— when in the West, they use all of the fingers because they want to aim. With Zen, we don't aim. The aiming is done naturally. We take a bead and we shoot immediately. We're not trying to get it right. We're trying to release the arrow. And that if we have very little tension in our fingers, then we can release it and the arrow will go true. But if we have our fingers around it, rolling the fingers off is actually going to make the arrow swing a bit to the right. And so these are the things that— but here's the important point: as soon as the arrow is let fly, in the West, everybody will watch the target. But in these, they're not competitions, they're exhibitions. Yes, they don't compete with each other for who hits the target. And so everybody in Japan is now going to keep their eyes focused on the archer as they see him finish the shot. By not paying attention, he's either going to redraw another arrow, or if he's just taken this one shot, then he's going to compose himself and walk off the stage and not even bother to look at the target. Because the air is the owner of the arrow, the arrow and the air are now married together and the archer is finished. His job was to release the arrow and once it's in the air, he's got no control over it.

**Speaker B:** So could we say that in fact we are creating the condition, the condition of success, but we are not doing it, because when we release the arrow, it's up to the— it's not in our power, so we are like creating the condition in which the thing will or not appear.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly so. And so a way that we can use that analogy that's in that book book on the Zen and the Art of Archery, is to recognize every word we speak is kind of an arrow that we shoot. And if the form is right, if the process of forming the words and shooting them out is wholesome, then that's the only thing that we can do. We cannot actually tell where it's going to land, not sure about actually where the word lands, but we can in fact be sure that we're doing it wisely, wholesomely. And so that's good, right? So doing it correctly is what Zen and the art of archery is all about, not getting the right results.

**Speaker B:** It's the process.

**Speaker A:** It's getting the process down.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And not sure about the outcome.

**Speaker B:** It sounds so much like the composing job I am doing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. That in fact, the beauty of that particular composition was the way that it was being composed in the moment of its composition. What actually you or Beethoven or Chopin or whatever they were doing with that chord sequence and whatnot like that, or maybe even Tchaikovsky, is that's it. You can hear that stuff in your mind and then you write it down on the paper, and then other musicians can work together to get that sequence that you had figured out. As a composer. I did, by the way, take one course in composition. I was not very good at it, but I've taken one course in composition. In fact, we spent almost the whole time decomposing César Franck.

**Speaker B:** I don't know him.

**Speaker A:** Well, he was French, but he was actually, I think, a student of Ravel.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And César Franck was very, very good at chord progressions. And that's what they were trying to teach in this particular course, was these chord progressions. And in fact, we got introduced to new chords and new terminology just by using Cesar Frank, because he was modern enough to be right into playing with what is harmonious. But can a tritone be harmonious? Generally, no. But when it's in the correct place, it can be. Fitting correctly. And so this is why I think that that composer was taught, was because it was a bit more modern than the standard chord sequences that are used. But it still has to do with the cadence, it has to do with the timing of tempo and the resolution. That that chord resolution is often the whole point. There's— I forgot who wrote it, but there's an etude, and I think it's in E minor. And the thing about this one particular etude, it goes a couple of minutes and it never resolves, ever, until the last chord. Never gets a resolution. Always goes from what you think is going to resolve, and no, it just keeps going in that cadence. So that's a kind of a toy. But Western people, they expect it to actually come to a resolution. We feel good when the chord resolves, when B goes to C basically is what I mean, you know what I'm talking about there, when that 7th goes to the octave. Okay. And we feel good because of that resolution.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But if we can keep the tension going, then that keeps that anticipation building up until it finally resolves. Only in some cases it never does.

**Speaker B:** Like in horror movies, they do that a lot.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in movies they do that a lot. They keep building and building and building and building.

**Speaker B:** It's tiring.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they never come to any resolution. So this is then the way that we can understand life, is life never comes to a resolution. It's always one complex chord change after another, after another. The tempo and the harmony will change, but it never comes to any resolution at all. So we can live our lives with not sure, because we don't know when it's over. Yes, I really like to have musicians as friends, because I've got a lot of old music that really fits in with the Dhamma. A lot of musical systems fit right in. That in fact, that's also true about a concerto, that the pianist in front of an audience who's playing a concerto— like, I'm kind of a favorite of Grieg's, but I like Rachmaninoff's also, and then the old standards. But the point is that We have to get it right. So in fact, you could say a concerto is Zen and the art of piano. You got to get it right. And so most of the musicians who get up to that step, they have to pay really, really close attention because it's so complicated and so correct, and get every note right. And that in fact, there are going to be disharmonies built in 'Will the audience be able to tell whether this note was written in that concerto, or whether you plugged it up?' And so they want to make sure that they get it right. And then there's a stage beyond that, and that is the stage where we can now— and very few people get to this stage. In fact, the only one that I know of that would be kind of at that level would be Rubinstein. Heard of Arthur Rubinstein?

**Speaker B:** No, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Arthur Rubinstein's been dead now for 40 years, and so— but back in the '70s, he was in his 90s then, and he was really, really world famous. But I had— we— on YouTube, there are a few, um, uh, videos of him, of him playing. And in a way, sometimes it looks like he's asleep, and at other times he's just all over the place. It's really amazing to watch a really, really old, accomplished musician.

**Speaker B:** He can have.

**Speaker A:** Fun. Yes. He affects the audience. His personality is now the dominant part of that, not getting every note correct. And so this is what we mean by play. So in the beginning, for our meditation practice, We do practice, just like you practice the piano or the violin. And the violin practice is different than the piano practice. Why? Because the violin's practice, you've got to get the note right first. On a piano, all you have to do is hit it and it's right, and we go from there. But with a violin, getting that thing in tune is the first thing that a child has to learn. But that builds into the fingers so that they know next time where the right note is. And so, that whole quality of practice then, basically is getting the young student ready to do a recital. Now what is a recital? A public performance. When the kid is learning, you probably remember this yourself, you don't want even Mom in the room when you're practicing. You want to do that alone. Yeah, and not only that, but there's a certain amount of joy that if we don't get the joy out of the music right from the very beginning, then we're not going to continue. Many times kids will stop after 1 or 2 years, and they do, and they stop when they do because that mom finally lets them quit, but their heart wasn't in it from the first lesson. Yeah, so this is also the quality that we're looking for. Let's get our heart in this practice of Anapanasati. Let's get some value out of it. Let's like to do it, because otherwise we're not going to keep doing it. But once we get the student to the point of liking it, now he's practicing to get ready for that first performance. And when we walk into that recital, we want to make sure we get every note right. And we stay in that place for about 20 years. And eventually we learn to play our instrument in the sense of having fun with it. And that's also the sequence that we do, that we practice alone to get ready to go meet the world so that we can perform with happiness and friendliness in the world. But when we get good at it, it becomes like second nature, and now it's all a joy, all a play. Everything is easy peasy because we've gotten that— the performance skills down that came from practice. And so music in that way is exactly like Anapanasati, except that the musical instrument we learn to play is life itself. That your whole life becomes a musical. And so that's a good way to talk about it, is to say it's just a play. Everything is okay. And we don't have to know everything.

**Speaker B:** And Sati, like the first beat of the measure with the in-breath, and the out-breath would be the, maybe the third, the third beat on the measure?

**Speaker A:** Actually, the sutras talk about Sati on both the in-breath and Sati on the out-breath. To make sure that this is an in-breath this long, and make sure that this is an out-breath that's long, that we actually play with them like that in the sense that the breath itself becomes a training for the Sati. So that if we can remember to breathe correctly, that also helps us to remember to have wholesome thoughts correctly also.

**Speaker B:** In between those in-breath and out-breath, there is the wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Um, actually it depends upon how long that you're holding your breath. I mean, you could be underwater and holding your breath for a long time and have all kinds of thoughts, but generally what we're shooting for is to have a gap between the in-breath and the out-breath, and that's a good time to— or a place to listen to the silence. Okay, then in fact we've already mentioned it a little bit about putting the horse in a stall by having a mantra. Okay, what that means then is that like Budo is a very common one in Thailand, but you could also do a more sophisticated one like Om Namah Shivaya, but Bu would be on the in-breath and then Do would be on the out-breath. And if we can get the mind down to just one word, we're pretty close, okay? But when the mind is all over the place, it's hard to still the mind. So the first thing is we want to put it into a corral, then put it into a stall, give it very little to do, okay? So when the mind is now doing the 'bu' on the in-breath and 'do' on the out-breath, if you let that out-breath out without taking an in-breath for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, we can actually get the mind to stop. And what we want to learn to do is to peg the in-breath with the beginning of the thought, and we don't let the thought begin until we breathe in. And so when the mind starts up again, that's the time to start breathing again. And so we can play that game: how long can I go between breaths before I either, one, have to take an in-breath, or number two, I start thinking that I have to take an in-breath? Now here's what happens in there when you recognize that the mind actually is quiet. That gives you such jubilation that you jump for joy and you start screaming and shouting about it, you're not in that state of no-mind now. But when you go into the no-mind and recognize it, it's, yeah, I can do that! But then it's gone. So now we got to go back and do it again. But if we think we can get it the second time because we want it, we had it, we can have it again, we're not going to get it. No, we have to go back and practice with the breathing, that we can actually get the mind to stop by using, intentionally using the breath and a little jingle. And it doesn't have to be Budo, that in fact another one, this is funny, but this is one that we can use is, "Coca on the in-breath and Cola on the out-breath." taste it in the mouth. Okay, can feel the bubbles because we get into it like that. And so that means that we can actually begin to change the sequence and the timing, etc., of the thought patterns that we have. But we are already able to do that with making them wholesome thoughts. If we can't make the thoughts wholesome, how can we possibly get them to stop and transform from a thought into a feeling?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But that's what we're looking for, that's the place where that wow becomes the Piti of the second Jhana, because the thoughts have been quieted down. Or when we do feel so good that there's no reason to talk to ourselves anymore about it, we just change our focus into how good we feel. Wow. And then we can see that how good we feel is quiet. It's got no discord. It does not have that blow-by-blow description anymore. We're at the fight or we're at the game rather than just hearing about it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so in fact, we can't stay in the first Jhana because when we feel the Piti, Then we don't think and so we are in the second Jhana?

**Speaker A:** That would be the second Jhana is when we're not thinking at all about how we feel, we're too busy actually feeling that good.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That our consciousness is into the sensations of the feelings, not the discourse or the running dialogue about it. That's the— and we can do that. I mean, there are actually procedures like the one that I just gave you with the mantra, just slowing it down and then letting it rest. But we can't have 'bu' and then a whole bunch of thoughts and then a 'do' and then a whole bunch of thoughts. That's not going to help. We have to actually get the mind down to just having one word, word for that whole in-breath and one word for the out-breath.

**Speaker B:** And that would be the first Jhana?

**Speaker A:** And that would be the entrance into the second Jhana. That's the fruit of the first Jhana, is getting the mind so still that it's ready to stop.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so when I'm doing that, I would be already in the first Jhana?

**Speaker A:** That when you're actually paying attention to how good you feel, rather than thinking about how good you want to feel, feel. That's the second Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We take Piti as the object, and it all feels so good. It literally is beyond words.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. So I think I don't have for now really feel that Piti so strong.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, never mind. Play with it. It's a toy.

**Speaker B:** So I play with the wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** You play with the wholesome thoughts, exactly.

**Speaker B:** And then I, one, one, sometime I would have the Piti and then I would choose it as an object.

**Speaker A:** Right, and then choose the Piti as the object, exactly. The first real object that we're going to take is the ability to keep things the thoughts wholesome, one after another after another, which in the sutta it talks about. You take the object of applied and sustained thought. In other words, we're going to keep it wholesome and keep it wholesome and keep it wholesome and keep it wholesome over and over and over again like that. And then when the good feelings corral, or let us say, kind of push those thoughts out of the way, In other words, you feel so good that it's hard to talk about it even. And so those are the two ways then of going into the second Jhana. One is by the Budo method that I was just telling you, and the other one is you do in fact then take directly, intentionally take objects of how good you feel rather than your object of telling yourself how good you feel. You stop telling yourself yourself how good you feel and just feel. Ah, it has no words to it, but it does have a kind of word in there. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so you can actually get in this state when you're composing music. It's called a flow state, and you guys have probably already talked about that. You can get on a roll. Yeah. By applying the mind to it, and then it just kind of takes off.

**Speaker B:** Yes. But I don't know, I always, it's another rule, but I always thought it would be maybe unwholesome, because I'm not aware of my surrounding, I'm very absorbed in the composition.

**Speaker A:** Well, I would not say that that would necessarily be an unwholesome state, but it would be a narrow-focused state. Yes, and that's okay, but we can call that concentration. But now here's the point: if you're in that state and the piano leg breaks Is that going to be enough to wake you up? How about your apartment burning down? Or maybe the cops are breaking through your door. They could break that concentration. So here's the point then. Here you are composing, and maybe a little brother or a daddy comes into the room, or maybe the baby is crying down the hall and we barely let it in. And so we keep on doing what we're doing because we're not really aware of what's going on around us. Okay, and so know the difference. Now I'm not saying one's better than the other, but not knowing— that's in this regard. And when we're saying, we're not talking about not sure in the sense of information and knowledge. We're talking about that we do at least know what's going on around us, that I can be in that flow state. And also, here's an example, would be martial arts. That when somebody is in that flow state, that means they're really here now. And when somebody's not in the flow state, he might be in that ring, in the boxing ring, but he starts thinking about Aunt Susie or Uncle Tommy or something like that, and he's going to get a face full of glove because he's not watching what's going on. Okay, so that means that when you're in composing, it would be better for you to be in a safe place rather than a dangerous place. Yeah, that would be my advice, is be in a safe place. Close the door and be alone when you're composing.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because then you can in fact concentrate. You can take your mind and put it on what you want to put it on without fear of the danger. This is in fact why the Buddha talks about seclusion so much, is let's get ourselves into a state or into a place that is safe. The place itself is safe so that we can get into a feeling of being safe, that in fact being in a feeling state of being safe will possibly allow you to go into that flow state where we can compose. Yeah, because you're really looking at what's going on, you're really noticing, but it is focused in chords, tempos, music, instruments, and that kind of stuff. But now we can also take that same skill and come and sit in Anapanasati and let that same music be the reality, be the trees and the wind and the everything that's around us. And so we can begin to see the music and the harmony of the reality that we're living in also. This is kind of what the Buddhists mean when they say, "Make me one with everything." That's a joke. The Dalai Lama went to the UN to give a speech, and when he was there, he went out on the street and went to the hot dog vendor and says, "Make me one with everything.".

**Speaker B:** Oh, I don't get it, I think.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the make me one with everything is a hot dog story about I want the bun and the mustard and the pickle and the slaw and the Hormel or whatever it is. Put everything on this hot dog. Okay, okay. That's what it's actually meant. But when the Dalai Lama says it, make me one with everything, he's talking about a different level of reality.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, okay, I see.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay, so in that regard, make me one with everything in the sense of this music right now, that this is my everything. And then we can also sit on the porch and then also become one with the bigger everything. Everything. The great big thing, everything, the Dhammakaya. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** And so when we are one with everything like that, there is no self.

**Speaker A:** There is no self, exactly. And there's also no thinking much, it's experiencing or taking data in. The mind moments are about sensory input, being in the body, being in the here now, and very little mind-moments of telling ourselves a story about it, either a blow-by-blow or just off someplace else. Okay, so in fact, we need to practice this getting out of the thinking process so that we can actually spend more time doing input rather than processing. And in fact, we can talk about this later on our next call because I'm beginning to talk about Paticcasamuppada. Now. Okay, but the point is, is that if we can stay in input mode rather than processing mode, we wind up not falling into bad feelings. We just stay in reality.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or is the way that I say it, just enjoy the show. You don't have to figure out what this— what whodunit. You don't have to figure out whodunit and then compare your ideas to what the end of the show is. Just enjoy the show.

**Speaker B:** Yes. The not sure seems to be really a key ingredient.

**Speaker A:** What's the key ingredient?

**Speaker B:** To be satisfied, to don't know, to be not sure.

**Speaker A:** To be dissatisfied, not sure, curious. Waiting, eager, eager, enthusiastic. This would be the words that we would use, as opposed to, 'I already know everything,' or, 'Oh no, what if this could happen?' Okay, so it's a different kind of not sure. Yes, because it's an anticipation. It's, um, that doubt is a hindrance, but doubt plus joy is enthusiasm. And now we really— we're going to watch, we're going to enjoy it. We're on it. We're on an investigation trip as opposed to a poor pity me trip.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so doubt sphere would be, uh, would be confusions.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, doubt, fear, and confusion are all wrapped together, but if you can add joy to that, then it becomes enthusiastic, it becomes curiosity itself. I'm curious, I'm waiting, here I am, I'm standing at the door, let's watch what happens. Let's open up and see what's going on. That's a different attitude, you see. So we have to develop that attitude. And by the way, in Anapanasati, or basically know the Eightfold Noble Path, that change of attitude is called Samma Sanghappa. Copy, it's the fourth item. The first one is to remember, to look, to make a change, and then congratulate ourselves. That congratulation is a change of attitude from being the victim into being the winner. We can do this. And so that whole idea then of the satisfaction that comes from being able to do it allows us to be in that state of not sure. Because it's not dangerous anymore. Okay, now we can investigate happily. And there's a whole lot of stuff going on. Watch closely now, there's a lot of stuff happening. Okay, Martin, why don't we finish now? This has been a really good talk. I've really enjoyed this, and I hope to see you again soon.

**Speaker B:** Me too.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** See you soon, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), explores the profound freedom found in admitting "I don't know" and the dangers of our cultural conditioning to always have an answer.

Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings:

### Core Theme: The Liberation of "Not Knowing"
The central point is that we are culturally trained to feel we must always **know** or **guess** an answer, even when we don't know. This pressure leads to making up stories (like ancient myths about stars), which can harden into fixed beliefs, dogma, and even religion. The talk encourages becoming comfortable with the state of **"not sure,"** framing it not as a hindrance but as a door to wonder, curiosity, and direct experience.

### Key Insights and Teachings:

1.  **Ignorance vs. Wholesome "Not Knowing":**
    *   The "ignorance" (avijjā) that causes suffering in the Second Noble Truth is a *specific* ignorance: not knowing that greed, hatred, and delusion lead to suffering.
    *   A more profound, general ignorance is our **aversion to the feeling of not knowing**. To avoid this discomfort, we fabricate stories that become our "facts," leading to delusion.

2.  **The Problem with Story-Making:**
    *   We constantly tell ourselves stories about our experiences. When we verbalize or narrate an experience (e.g., describing a meditation insight to someone), we often latch onto the **story** rather than the actual, wordless experience. This story then becomes a source of attachment and delusion.

3.  **Meditation as Mind Training - The "Wild Pony" Analogy:**
    *   The untrained mind is like a wild pony roaming dangerous wilderness (unwholesome, scattered thoughts).
    *   **Stage 1: The Pasture.** The first training is to corral the mind into a "pasture" of **continuous wholesome thoughts** (e.g., "I'm safe," "This breath is good"). This is the foundation.
    *   **Stage 2: The Corral.** Next, focus the mind on a single, repetitive object (like a word or mantra with the breath). This is like a corral, narrowing the focus.
    *   **Stage 3: The Stall.** Finally, refine focus to a very precise, single-pointed awareness (like a mantra on each breath), which can lead to mental stillness.
    *   This process moves the mind from scattered thinking toward unified awareness (samādhi).

4.  **Samādhi vs. Concentration:**
    *   **Concentration** often implies narrowing focus and excluding things (like tuning out the world to focus).
    *   **Samādhi** is a unified, integrated awareness where all aspects of the mind work together in harmony "like the poles of a teepee tied together at the top." It is about **bringing everything together**, not filtering things out.

5.  **Anchoring in the Body and Senses:**
    *   Westerners often live in daydreams (visual/auditory mental movies). The practice is to shift attention **out of the thinking mind and into the sensory reality of the body** (the breath, physical sensations, sounds).
    *   An effective technique is to act as a "radio announcer" giving a gentle, blow-by-blow description of present-moment sensory experience (e.g., "in-breath... out-breath... feeling of the chair...").

6.  **The Danger of Turning Teachings into Rules:**
    *   A student notes that when he tries to practice because "Dhammarato said so," it kills the joy and feels like an external rule. Dhammarato agrees, highlighting this is a classic trap: we internalize instructions as "shoulds" instead of discovering the joy of practice for ourselves. **The happiness must be your own.**

7.  **"Not Sure" as a State of Wonder and Creativity:**
    *   Embracing "not sure" removes the pressure to know everything and opens up a state of **wonder-filled curiosity**. This is essential for both meditation and creative endeavors (like the composer's process discussed).
    *   The analogy of **Zen archery** is used: the archer's job is to perfect the *process* of shooting with full attention and correct form. The arrow's flight (the outcome) is then released and is "not sure." Similarly, we focus on creating wholesome conditions in the present moment, not on controlling outcomes.

8. **Jhana as a Natural Progression:**
    *   The talk describes a natural progression into meditative absorption (jhana):
        *   **First Jhana:** Characterized by sustained wholesome thinking (vitakka/vicāra) and the resulting pleasant feeling (pīti/sukha).
        *   **Second Jhana:** When the pleasant feeling becomes so strong and full that the verbal commentary drops away. One simply **feels** the joy without talking about it internally. This can happen either by the mind naturally becoming still from sustained wholesome thought or through focused techniques like mantra breathing.

9. **Integration with Life and Art:**
    *   The entire path is compared to learning a musical instrument: initial awkward practice leads to competent performance, which eventually becomes joyful, effortless play. The ultimate aim is to make **life itself** the instrument we play with joy and mastery.
    *   The final goal is to spend more mind-moments in **sensory input mode** ("enjoying the show" of reality) rather than in **processing/story-making mode**, which leads to suffering.

### Conclusion:
The talk culminates by reframing **doubt**. When mixed with fear, doubt is a hindrance. But when mixed with **joy**, doubt transforms into **enthusiastic curiosity**—the eager, open, and investigative mind that is essential for insight and freedom. The path is about developing this joyful, "not-sure" attitude through continuous, kind, and present-moment awareness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers (primarily Speaker A, Dhammarato) to illustrate their teachings about meditation, mindfulness, and the human tendency to avoid uncertainty:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Wild Horse / Pony Mind:**
    *   **Description:** The untrained mind is compared to a wild horse or stallion roaming dangerously in the wilderness (unwholesome, discursive thoughts).
    *   **Purpose:** To map the stages of mental training:
        *   **Pasture:** Bringing the mind into a safe field of "wholesome thoughts."
        *   **Corral:** Further focusing the mind, likened to using a chant or song repeatedly.
        *   **Stall:** Narrow, focused concentration, like using a mantra (e.g., "Bu-Do").
    *   **Lesson:** Meditation is a gradual process of taming and training the mind to stay in safe, beneficial states.

2.  **The Teepee / Yurt Poles:**
    *   **Description:** Samadhi (unified, collected mind) is compared to the structure of a teepee, where many poles are tied together at a single point (the Samadhi point) for stability.
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast **Samadhi** (bringing everything together in unity) with mere **concentration** (which excludes things). It illustrates mental integration versus fragmentation.

3.  **Radio Announcer vs. Television Viewer:**
    *   **Description:** The untrained mind is like a radio listener who needs a "blow-by-blow" description (internal narration) to understand an event. The mindful state is like a TV viewer who can directly see the event (experience reality) without the constant narration.
    *   **Purpose:** To encourage moving from discursive thinking about experience to direct sensory awareness ("being at the game rather than just hearing about it").

4.  **Zen Archery:**
    *   **Description:** The process of shooting an arrow in Zen practice—focusing on correct form and release without aiming for or attaching to the result—is a metaphor for action and speech.
    *   **Purpose:** To teach focusing on the **wholesome process** (right effort, right intention) rather than being attached to or anxious about outcomes. Our words/actions are like arrows; we can only ensure they are released wisely.

5.  **Musician's Progression:**
    *   **Description:** The path of meditation is compared to learning a musical instrument:
        *   **Private Practice:** Initial solitary practice (developing basic skills).
        *   **The Recital:** Performing correctly in public (applying skills in life, trying to "get it right").
        *   **Masterful Play:** Finally reaching a stage like the pianist Rubinstein, where it becomes joyful, effortless "play."
    *   **Purpose:** To frame the Dhamma practice as a skill that evolves from disciplined training to joyful mastery, where life itself becomes the instrument.

6.  **The Encyclopedia / Vast Library:**
    *   **Description:** The totality of human knowledge is compared to a vast library. The Pali Canon itself is a massive bookcase. No one can know it all.
    *   **Purpose:** To combat the "need to know" and the "fear of missing out" (FOMO). It emphasizes that we already "know enough" to be happy and friendly; we don't need to know everything.

7.  **Chord Progressions and Resolution:**
    *   **Description:** Life and experience are compared to a musical piece with complex chord changes that often delay or avoid resolution.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that life, like music, is an ongoing flow without final "resolution," and we can learn to be comfortable and find wonder in that "not sure," unresolved state.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Origin of Religion (Uncle Jimmy at the Campfire):**
    *   **Story:** A prehistoric child points at a star and asks "Uncle Jimmy" what it is. Feeling pressured to know, he makes up a story. The story, repeated over generations, hardens into religion.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the deep-seated social training of the "need to know" and how we invent stories to cover ignorance, which then solidify into belief systems.

2.  **The Professor's Exam Feedback:**
    *   **Story:** Speaker A recalls a professor giving him an A-minus on an essay exam with the note: *"Just answer the questions, don't tell me everything you know."*
    *   **Purpose:** To critique the cultural habit of valuing the quantity of information over relevance, and how this leads to guesswork (like in multiple-choice tests) and unfounded opinions.

3.  **Ajahn Po's "Not Sure" and "Tatatha" Teachings:**
    *   **Story:** Speaker A recounts how his teacher, Ajahn Po, would sneak up and whisper "not sure" or "tatatha" (here-now) as a direct, non-verbal teaching method.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the core teachings of embracing uncertainty ("not sure") and waking up to present-moment sensory awareness ("here-now") as antidotes to delusion and daydreaming.

4.  **The Dalai Lama's Hot Dog Joke:**
    *   **Story:** The Dalai Lama goes to a hot dog vendor and says, "Make me one with everything," playing on the spiritual ideal and the literal act of putting all toppings on a hot dog.
    *   **Purpose:** To lighten the conversation and illustrate the difference between conceptual oneness and the direct, experiential "oneness" of being fully immersed in present sensory reality.

### **Overall Theme of the Metaphors and Stories:**
They collectively build a case against the **"need to know"** and the **"story-making"** mind. They advocate for embracing **"not sure"** as a state of wonder, shifting from **thinking about** experience to **directly sensing** it, and finding joy in the **process** of practice rather than clinging to rules or outcomes. The metaphors from nature (horse), structure (teepee), and art (music, archery) make the abstract meditation concepts tangible and relatable.
