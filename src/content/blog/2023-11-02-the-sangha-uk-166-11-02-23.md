### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Both sort of sickness as well as, you know, things breaking, sort of, you know, fading away, if you will. For example, the webcam, you know. So there's that, that's kind of pointing to impermanence as well as, you know, Alex was talking a little bit about— I think you were talking about your hip there. You know, and that kind of points to old age here and there, just things, you know. Yeah, so there's a couple of things, right, that came up, I think, that pointed to that as a topic.

**Speaker B:** I think the main one is Dukkha, like the main reason why we're all here and the main reason why we want to meditate is because we want to find an end to our suffering. And the good news is that there is an end to your suffering. And that's with the well-directed mind. The well-directed mind leads to benefit and welfare for that future rebirth of yourself, or whatever you want to think of it as. But if your mind is unskilled, undeveloped, and you let it run rampage, and think thoughts centered around personality view of I'm this person, and worldly concerns of what other people think about you, what's going to happen to me, what's going to happen to my body. All of that is like from the vantage point of ignorance. And like, I only teach the the calls from the vantage point of wisdom, otherwise I wouldn't be talking. And this wisdom for me is also impermanent. I don't claim to have some sort of permanent wisdom. Like I come, I fall back into ignorance, and I like forget about all this, and I get mad about something or some shit like that. But the more that I've remembered to return to this state of mind, the greater it made the rest of my life. Like, I just, my interactions with people go a lot smoother. I'm getting into a lot less conflict with other people. So I, uh, that's kind of like the measure, like anyone out there listening to this, like if you want to measure the effectiveness of any style of meditation, spiritual teaching or practice, the litmus test for the progress is how much better and easier is your life getting in the world and interacting with others. So if your life is getting easier, then it's a sign of spiritual progress. And if you're getting into more conflicts with more people, well, actually, it's because your mind is creating those conflicts and looking for them. Like your mind, this is like your— everything is subjective. Like your whole reality is made of mind. So you can make it your own living hell or your own paradise on earth. And the choice is yours, which way you want to go down every moment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so have a choice.

**Speaker B:** The choice is important. I don't think it's emphasized enough in spiritual circles. I think a lot of teachings, I mean, will have pointers that are designed to say like, there is no choice, you know what I mean? In a sense, like the no-self realization that there's no self making choices at all. It's all just arising due to causes and conditions. But the funny thing is you have to make the choice to see it that way. Like, you have to make the choice to understand that for yourself. Otherwise, it's not going to help you. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it should be totally pragmatic. Is this making me happy? If it's making me happy, then it's working. If it's not, then you need to change it to something that is making you happy. So you have a choice whether you want to go down a path of happiness or a path of sorrow, lamentation, despair. And we make this choice moment to moment. It's not— you're not going to make that choice once and for all, you know. That's a pitfall that we often fall into. We think we're going to be enlightened once and for all because of one big special experience. But no, reality is unfolding and ever-changing. All of it is the Enlightenment, even the ignorance part of it. The good and the bad. Yeah, everything that happened, everything that happened up into your life up until this point is the meditation. Always was and always will be. And this moment is the meditation. And there's nothing else that could ever not be the meditation into the future either. All there is is this moment and this meditation, and this real understanding of this experience eliminates all fear of death because you realize it's like the deathless aspect of reality, like Spinoza's God, so the God of pure math. So Spinoza defines God as that which is cause unto itself. So essentially, like, the law of dependent origination is cause unto itself because that's what creates causes and effects. So the law of dependent origination is God. Like, understanding that there's a way to the light and a way to the darkness. Is all part of the process of realizing God, because God is the light, but the light makes the darkness too. Like, they couldn't exist without each other. So God is both the light and the darkness, but you have to fully go into the light to realize that for yourself. You can't find it in the darkness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's hard to see anything stumbling around in the dark, but it helps if you have a flashlight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you may trip and fall on some stuff if you don't— if you're not looking where you're going. That's one of the main things that helped— that Dhammarato, uh, really fucking woke me up is, yeah, you're gonna trip and fall if you don't look what you're doing. Look at where you're going. And so when I was like, oh shit, I have to actually look at what I'm doing and hold myself accountable for the suffering that I'm creating for myself now, and and I'm not a victim. Wow, that's a revolutionary thing for me, that I'm not a victim. I can choose whether I'm a winner or a loser, and the power is within me. So that's like the main message behind it. Like, if you're a loser in your own mind, it's because you're a sadomasochist and you have some kind of kinky fetish of being a loser. Like, oh, I'm such a loser. Like a Radiohead or something. I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo. Like, uh, you're kind of like just in an emo grungy phase of like, oh, let me see how bad the suffering can really get before I want out of it. And then eventually we see how bad the suffering really gets and we really want out of it. And that's when people are open to like the actual meditation practice. But you have to keep wanting out of it. Like, you can't just want out of it once and get out of it and then go back and do it. Like, it's a practice, it's a skill development, a process.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think that's, uh, really helpful to bring up. And in terms of also, like, not becoming or at least working with that so that we, you know, avoid, if you will, complacency in the sense of like, oh well, you know, then we stumble and fall because we're not looking. We forget, we're like, oh yes, no, it's all— we got it, we got it.

**Speaker B:** And like, yeah, well, yeah, uh, here's the thing, like, you may have kicked ignorance out the front door, but you may have left the window open, and ignorance comes creeping in through the window. So through a back door, so to speak, ignorance comes in a way that it slithers in, in a way that you didn't expect it to. And when it slithers back in, you have to realize it's just part of the process. Oh shit, I gotta close my window now too, and close the door, you know what I mean? Uh, so it's like, uh, The good news about ignorance is that when you're in ignorance, there's nothing you can do about it anyways, because as soon as you're out of it, as soon as there's something you can do about it, you're already out of ignorance. So as soon as you realize you are in ignorance, that is the moment you are in wisdom. So it's like, uh, the fool who knows he's a fool knows he's not a fool to that extent, but the fool who knows not he's a fool truly is a fool. Uh, I think that's Shakespeare. So it's like, if you have the self-awareness of like your flaws and you're honest with yourself, then you're much more awakened than someone who's in denial and pretends like they don't experience all that stuff because they develop some sort of enlightenment complex, right? Uh, so true authenticity with your experience is the litmus test. It's where the meat of the sandwich is. It's where the, the real alchemy of our experiences, really playing with the sensations, playing with the tensions in our body, and playing with the way our mind is engineered to react to those sensations. And you just let all those sensations in, like you're not in control of any of it. So that pointer makes sense in that context. That's like very fourth Jhana-y. Pointer. It's in like Dzogchen, it's in Zen, like just let it all in. Like it's just this moment. Open up to it completely. Don't label it, don't draw any distinctions, don't draw any boundaries in it. Just let it all wash in and be what it is. And if you can really feel that and experience that, that would be a fourth Jhana state of equanimity. And from that state, or from that visceral experience, it's extremely likely that that will blossom into a total fruition of experiencing Nibbana, which is just essentially the cessation of perceptions and feelings. So like all of your mental interpretation of reality comes to an end. And all of your feelings about it comes to an end, and all that you're left with is reality itself. And there's nothing beyond that reality. So that would be a true glimpse, like a true Nibbana. But experiencing the spiritual highs and lows is not the total realization. The spiritual highs and lows is just an indicator you're going in the right direction. But you need to like follow it to its end and like find the, like, the real— where like the real salvation is, like the real relief from suffering, the real peace, like the real freedom. And really feel that and discover for it, discover it for yourself on your own too. Like when you're just sitting under the tree by yourself alone in nature, and you're just completely in that moment, and there's nothing outside of that moment. That is an awakened state, and there's nothing— it doesn't need to be more woo-woo than that or magical than that. It's very human. It's actually a very natural state to be in. It's not as unattainable or otherworldly as a lot of meditation teachers will make it sound like. That it's not something normal that normal people can do. It doesn't have to be a superhuman feat of meditation. It could just be you chilling out under a tree, having a good time, talking with your buddies. Why isn't this as good as having a total Nirodha Samadhi for fucking 10 days and you're a catatonic zombie essentially for 10 days? You're— who are you going to help, right? Who are you going to help with that? Like, whose life are you going to make better, right?

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** I mean, that's just, uh, it's really cool. It's really cool, like, feat of meditation, and it's very impressive.

**Speaker C:** Very good advertising.

**Speaker B:** But it's not— it's good advertising, but it's not the real thing. Communicates to real people. Like, I've seen in, like, in good spiritual communities, it's not just one teacher talking on their high horse and all the students are listening, but there's multiple people, like, responding with their own wisdom. And so, like, like, when I get to hear, like, you speak and share things, Alexander, like I feel like it sends me the same benefit, uh, to like hear those teachings from you. You know what I mean?

**Speaker C:** I feel that way too with you, Scott. It's like talking out loud about things we all need to remember.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's wonderful. It really warms my heart.

**Speaker B:** I, I like this type of experience much more than the weird like guru cults. It's not a guru cult, but like the— I've been in those circles where it's like, oh know all about that one guy, uh, but like, I, I like, uh, authentic interactions like this much more. Like, it feels, it feels very heartwarming. Although, to be fair, I had this type of interaction, like a heartwarming connection with the guru guy himself. So like, I had that with him, but like, then I wanted to become my own teacher. Like, I didn't want to always be his student, you know what I mean? Yes.

**Speaker C:** Very much so. It's so beautiful to hear that the practice does that for us. It opens doors for us that otherwise we would close on ourselves.

**Speaker B:** I like hearing the success stories rather than— so like when I see someone like lit up and happy with happiness like Alexander, like that, that's a success story of the practice I'm looking at right here, rather than a bunch of people like having a coping mechanism who are actually very troubled.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** So like, these people who are very troubled who are kind of hanging on to a spiritual teaching as a coping mechanism, they're not really getting the teaching.

**Speaker C:** Uh, yeah, yeah, there's not an actual transmission taking place there. No, it's just kind of weird bumps.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like, uh People will latch on to any sort of identity they can to avoid ego death, and the spiritual identity is the last identity that they latch on to. And they latch on to it so fucking hard, dude. They really latch on to that bitch like, oh, I'm spiritual, I'm a spiritual kind, like I'm like, I'm on another wavelength. I, I realize I have God realization, bro. You don't get it. I realize I'm Jesus Christ, or like, I realize God, and you guys don't understand me because I'm more awakened than all of you. So like, that's kind of lunacy.

**Speaker C:** It is. It's more ignorance. It's more discrimination. It's more dividing, right? And one of the things that I always hear about when we talk like this is non-duality. You know, that's the big Western buzzword for anybody that doesn't want to talk about something with a name on it, you know, because we like that in the West. We like blank white t-shirts sometimes. We think that even that can be an identity, right? This blank white t-shirt like you're talking about. Maybe we get the t-shirt really blank.

**Speaker B:** And really white, or a vase of flowers. Yeah, it's often a guy talking next to a vase of flowers, but hey man, some of the most happy, some of the most powerful things I've ever heard was from a guy talking next to a vase of flowers. So I have to give it credit where it's due. Like, right, definitely.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it builds, right? It builds. It's like I talked about earlier with advertising, you know, when we talk about Nirodha Sampahti, when we talk about other attainments or other such things, they're really great to grab the attention really rapidly, right? And then maybe you get to the point where we don't want to put Adidas on it, maybe we don't want to put Nike on it anymore, we just want it to be a blank white shirt. But it's still hard to give your shirt up. Yeah, you're still very used to having a t-shirt, even if it's blank and white at this point.

**Speaker B:** And the thing is, like, once, once you get to the point of wisdom and realizing that you don't have to have a t-shirt, you can still wear whatever t-shirt you want, just without attachment to it. You just, but you just realize it's not me. Like, I can be this personality and I can have fun, I can joke around, but I set it down at the end of the day. Like, I set it down and like, if I'm going to do the dishes in that moment, I'm just a guy doing dishes. I'm not like a spiritual practitioner or a teacher or awakened being. I'm just a normal person doing dishes like any other person would be doing dishes. So like, enlightenment is very ordinary. It's just moment to moment, sensate reality. Just this. It appears, it disappears. Okay, so what? What does that change for me experientially? Is there a me in any of it? Any of the changing, like, sights, sounds, mental impressions, interpretations, bodily feelings? They're all constantly changing from moment to moment. And that's the purpose of the breathing meditation, is to realize that experientially in your body until you don't have a body. So if you realize that enough in your body, your body will literally dissolve into the universe. And there's no other way I can say it than that. So yeah, so, so yeah, saying Nirodha, Samma Patti, stuff like that is an attention grabber. Like, I agree with you, Alex, it can be an advertisement, attention grabber, but I also want to emphasize that it is a real thing and I've experienced it for myself.

**Speaker C:** And it's right here, it's right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's right here right now. And I'm not gonna pretend like I, I don't— like, I'm not fully experiencing it. And, uh, I just don't have my own— I have my own— I don't have— I don't subscribe to their model to it. So even though I teach I'm, well, like, I'm, I wouldn't even consider myself teaching. I'm just a dude talking to you guys as a friend.

**Speaker C:** Just natural elements interacting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So I'm just saying stuff that's interesting to me. I don't like subscribe to like the four path model that like, oh, I'm gonna be a stream enterer and then I'm gonna become an Anagami and an Arhat.

**Speaker C:** Well, you got it. You left one out. So that makes sense that you wouldn't subscribe to all four. You only said three.

**Speaker B:** So if I become an, if I become an Arahant and that means that like I can't get, uh, uh, biologically activated by a certain gender, then that means I'm not an Arahant by no means. And I don't think I ever will want to be an Arahant, at least until like I can't. Like, I mean, eventually like every old man has to call it quits, right? Like there's gonna come a day where I'm gonna be too old and I'm not gonna be able to do that anymore. And then maybe I want to be an Arahant then, but until then I'm just going to live my life how I want to live it.

**Speaker C:** That's the retirement plan. Yeah, I talked about it in the last call. I asked if someone believed about whether or not they did this practice, their wiener wouldn't work anymore. I don't know if there was something— that's why I bring it up.

**Speaker B:** That's why it's actually surprisingly.

**Speaker C:** Common, right? It's very common.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I'm not weird to bring that up. Like, I'm glad we agree that that's something you've encountered as well.

**Speaker C:** Absolutely. I always just think of it in the way where, like, and it sounds kind of silly at times, but you know, if you offer someone that is really good at feeling okay and having a lot of well-being available to them something delicious to eat, most of the time they're not going to turn you down. It would be pretty ignorant to do so. Yeah, because this is just how it is, man. This is the human condition. This is what we are pointing to, is how things are. And we do it over and over for each other so that we can keep coming back to how things are instead of building up sandcastles that just— life just knocks them right over anyways. And when life knocks them over and we need to look to how things are, sometimes some people need to point again for us. And so it's very nice when we don't have all of these things that we hold on to, all these rules of self-sufficiency or this equality complex, inferiority complex, superiority complex. We can let go of all of that. And if we can let go of all of that, then no matter who's pointing to the truth, it's the truth, right? And we're very lucky because we don't actually have Dhamma. We only have Upaya. We only have skillful means.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, absolutely, dude. And I'm really glad you mentioned that and like we're on the same, uh, wavelength about that because, uh, I'm a recovering Catholic, so yeah, I was like conditioned. I'm like, I mean, I guess I'm traumatized by the Catholicism of, uh, it doesn't really agree with my, uh deviancy, let's just say that. But yeah, it's good to hear you say that, brother. And like, yeah, the wisdom is in the moment of the wisdom. Like, it's more about like the experience of happiness now and like not making rules. Like, the whole idea is to get rid of the rules. Get rid of the rules for being happy.

**Speaker C:** What's left?

**Speaker B:** What's left?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just this.

**Speaker B:** And like, yeah, I mean, and if sex is in that moment and it's good and it's not harming either of the people, then perfect. If it's harming— but don't get me wrong, if it harms either one of the people, then the Buddha does not recommend. So suffering should be the litmus test. Does this relationship lead to more suffering? Experientially, or does it lead to more happiness experientially? And if it leads to more happiness, then that's a God's precious gift to you, brother.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Hallelujah.

**Speaker C:** Say yes, sir.

**Speaker B:** But absolutely, if that doesn't arise, well, you're already like having holy communion with the universe itself, and you couldn't— you have no lesser desires beyond that. So you just take life as it comes. Yeah, easygoing, easygoing way to live life. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker C:** Letting it come, letting it go. Yeah, I was looking at my bathroom sink. I had to unclog it the other day and it had a whatever in the drain. I pulled some hair out of it, but because of the hair that was obstructing the drain, the water would fill up in the sink, you know, even though I didn't have a little plungy deal in there. And so because of that, it would pop down and bubbles would come up, right? Lots of bubbles. But as soon as I stuck the little deal down the drain and yoinked out the offending hair or whatever clog, you know, whap, sink just drained, wham, everything, nothing left in the sink, no bubbles to come up. And I find when we talk about the practice of meditation, this is really not a terrible way to approach it, because one of the first things that we need to do, whether we look to the Satipatthana Sutta or the Anapanasati Sutta, whatever the instructions are, is to get rid of the hindrances, to get them into abeyance, right? If they're gone forever, that's wonderful. We don't need to worry about it anymore. But if they're not gone forever, we need to know whether or not they're there, right?

**Speaker B:** So like, they're never gone forever. I'm going to tell you that right now, boy.

**Speaker C:** Those hindrances, you're right.

**Speaker B:** Those hindrances are never gone forever. And if you think they're gone forever, you've already fallen into the trap, my boy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's a hindrance.

**Speaker B:** You gotta wake up.

**Speaker C:** You gotta wake up to see clearly again.

**Speaker B:** You gotta wake up to the hindrance of wanting to get rid of hindrances. It's kind of a mindfuck.

**Speaker C:** I'm sorry, it goes back on itself over and over again.

**Speaker B:** The desire to get rid of desire is still desire. So like defeat, you know what I mean? You can't have that desire. Just let the hindrance be what it is. Let it be how it is. It's okay. All of it is fine just the way that you are. Like, you're okay.

**Speaker C:** If you don't pick them up and take them to be you and your own, they don't cause a problem for seeing clearly. They can just be there, seen clearly. And that is an important point to make because a lot of people, when they hear those instructions, they think already, because there are hindrances, that they're doing something wrong. And so then they have doubt, which that's another hindrance come up. But if they can accept that, hey, the point of this is to see things as they are rather than how we want them to be, yeah, then like you're saying, Wakey Wakey, we can accept the warts that are right there. And when we accept them, you know, we don't need to worry so much about what they're doing, you know, because the worry is another hindrance. Restlessness. Yeah, right. So as we can see, yeah, we need to make sure that we make that point when we talk to each other.

**Speaker B:** This is why I pull from different traditions too. I'm also into like Christian mysticism. And like a lot of the teachings of Jesus will like be saying like it's all just the Kingdom of Heaven is within you. And like it's all like you die, die to yourself and God will be born within you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, and Meister Eckhart has a quote, I don't want to mess it up, so let me bring it up. Uh, he's something to the extent of with the eye of With the eye, I see God. God sees me.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that is a really beautiful one. I also really enjoy that quote. And if we look to other Christian mysticism type books like that, did you read The Cloud of Unknowing? In there it talks about how a still heart is more essential than the completion of the task, you know.

**Speaker B:** Wait, can you hold that thought? Can you repeat that? But I just want to say this before, like, I lose it. Uh, but I want to hear that quote too. But yeah, I got the quote. I wanted to say the actual quote. I was trying to remember. Uh, the eye through which— oh damn, Amazon ad popped up. Just another hindrance. Okay, the eye through which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me. My eye and God's eye are one. One seeing, one knowing, one love. And that's it. That's one of the most famous Christian mystics of all time, Meister Eckhart. Now, doesn't that sound pretty fucking, like, awake? It does.

**Speaker C:** It sounds pretty fucking on point, huh?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Wouldn't it be wonderful if that had been what was in the church?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Christians don't really do this, follow the teachings of Jesus, uh, Right, they really don't, right? Yeah. And if there is a couple that do, then like, uh, I, I fully support it. Like, uh, there's different paths to the same mountaintop, and all, right, all roads lead to Rome, and all rivers go to the same ocean. Uh, yeah, and all those platitudes.

**Speaker C:** Uh, it's one of the reasons that I like to hear from others like you're talking about too, from other traditions and such, is because it's such a great reminder that The Dharma that we do have, that we do share, is also Upaya.

**Speaker B:** The Dharma can be found everywhere. So it's not that the teaching of the Buddha isn't complete. It's just that other traditions are incomplete. But each tradition has a piece that the Dharma completes fully.

**Speaker C:** The Dharma of the Buddha Yeah, the—.

**Speaker B:** After, after I learned about Buddhism, it was only, uh, after I learned about the teachings of the Buddha that I could fully understand Christ. But before I understood no-self and insight into no-self and insight into, uh, the suffering of all phenomena and the impermanence, that's when I could realize— that's when I could like understand the Christ-like point of view of the total forgiveness and total love and treating your neighbor as yourself, because it's you just— it's all just happening and none of it is you, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, they talk about an emptying out in Christian mysticism as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, they say for, for God to enter your— if your room is full of stuff So if your mind is full of stuff, you know, the room is going to be too cluttered for God to enter the room. First, your room must be empty, Pranka, for God to enter. You have to empty the mind, right? This is what we teach. Empty the thoughts, empty the feelings, empty the ideas, empty the notions you have about the way things are. Don't know, like go back into the Zen don't know mind. Don't know what you are. If you don't know what you are, you already are what you are. If you don't know what you are, as soon as you know what you are, that's an imagination superimposed on top of what you actually are.

**Speaker C:** On top of this.

**Speaker B:** On top of this.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Oh, cool, man.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** It's amazing. And like you talked about earlier in the practice, bringing cessation of perception and feeling, this is Nirodha. This is the third noble truth.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and it's our duty to recognize, to realize it. You know, when we see it, when we see suffering, we need to understand it. We can't be shying away from it being discriminatory. We need to be non-discriminatory and we need to have Upekkha, equanimity, non-discrimination. You know, so we need to be non-discriminatory towards suffering because our duty is to understand it.

**Speaker B:** You know, and don't— and also don't be afraid of the release of energies that might happen. Like, some people literally might start crying, like, if they open up to it. Yeah, so like, yeah, so some people are afraid to like go into the experience of it fully. Yeah, uh, and people have different reactions. I'm not saying— oh yeah, it doesn't— I'm not saying like if you don't cry, like, you don't really feel it. That's not what I'm saying, right? But I'm saying like it can create certain releases of energies that can be uncomfortable for some people. So it's important to have like people who have been there, done that, and say there's a way out of that and to the other side.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, point out towards the other shore, towards well-being. We have a shore with suffering, shore with well-being.

**Speaker B:** Like I'm standing on the well-being shore and I'm saying, hey guys, It's the party's nice over here, come join.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and that's a really wonderful way to talk about it as well, because nobody else can swim but the practitioner. Nobody else can get in the raft. Nobody else can even put together the raft to cross to the other shore for another person. Everyone has to put together their own raft.

**Speaker B:** You do. You have to go— Path of the teaching. Piece it together for yourself.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, even just seeing the path is a wonderful thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I didn't like this when I first started, but someone—.

**Speaker C:** You have to.

**Speaker D:** Be the CEO of your own path. I didn't like the way that sounded.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, yeah, you are the commander-in-chief. You are the commander in chief of awareness is the commander in chief, or like reality is the commander in chief and you are that. So to say something, Nisargadatta Ji, you are that. Like there's not two things. There's not a, there's not a me and God out there. The me creates God. Me presupposes a separation from God. You are that, and God is that, and all that there is is that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and we talk about maps, they're really nice to have, with paths, they're nice to have. If you see that once, we talk about it, and we talk about that being a Srotapanna. And if you see that all the time, like you're talking about, Scott, that's, that's our Arhat. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I think the main thing is seeing the cycles when you're in it. The main thing is seeing the main insight that the Buddha always brings it back to is seeing the Dukkha when it comes up and seeing the Dukkha when it— I mean, seeing the cessation when it goes away and just becoming more aware of when that's actually happening. Yeah. And So you can see the impersonal nature of Dukkha arise, have a resistance, and then eventually subside, and you can experience the relief of Dukkha Nirodha. So it doesn't mean you don't experience Dukkha, it's that you understand both fully. You understand Dukkha and you understand its evolution. Like you understand the alchemy of Dukkha into Dukkha Nirodha.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's a wonderful gift to have that feeling of cessation and freedom come to bear in the moment.

**Speaker B:** And it's important to realize whatever bodily sensations are arising for you right now, like those bodily sensations are like okay just the way that they are. And like to not have an agenda for it to be any other way than the way that it is. So like a scientist just observing something with a pure curiosity to understand what it is. Like, there's no— Paticcasamuppada. You're not— Yeah, there's no expectation for how your experience of the body and the mind should be. You just look at how it actually is. That's the first step. It's complete honesty.

**Speaker C:** It is scary sometimes, to be honest.

**Speaker B:** It can be scary. Yeah, no, I'm saying it can be scary. It can actually be scary. That's why I'm saying, um, explosive. It's for those who seek it out. That's why we don't proselytize here at, uh, in Buddhism. We don't proselytize, or in the Sangha, we don't proselytize. At least, like, we don't try to convert anyone or spread it to people that don't want it or don't want to hear it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but you haven't been going door to door with pamphlets?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, we haven't been going door to door.

**Speaker D:** You too can enter Parinibbana sooner if.

**Speaker B:** You buy my retreat in Costa Rica. No, honestly though, like, more— if, dude, if I actually— if I caught a flame and I became a spiritual teacher that could— people would pay for my retreats, hell yeah, I would do it. I would do that shit in a heartbeat. I just don't think I'm that— like, I'm kind of more like a niche. I think I'm too politically incorrect to ever become a famous guru. I just don't have enough of a filter. A lot of my flaws end up coming through and you see how human I actually am. So I'd much rather be that type of guy, just niche internet guy. Doesn't have to be too big of a deal. There's nothing woo-woo about it. It's just the genuine happiness of it. It makes me happy, and I like talking about it. Talking about it makes me happy. So why don't we just get together as friends and talk about it together?

**Speaker D:** Well, maybe you're already happy. That's why you're talking about it.

**Speaker C:** It's making you happy.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Well, that's the only way. That's the only way it works is if you're already happy. The path to happiness. It's weird. It's so weird. The path to happiness is happiness itself.

**Speaker C:** It is happiness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** At the same time, paradoxically, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said in a retreat talk at the beginning, He asserted that if you're already happy, you don't really have a point of being here since you can't feel the burden of life, the whip of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** I don't have that. That's not my style. My style is the more the merrier. If you're happy, like, please join my club. Like, I'm happy to have you be happy with me. That's just my approach. I think the pitfall of Buddhism sometimes, just in my personal critique, is yes, understanding suffering is important. But happiness is a complete in and of itself path on its own. And this shows up in other forms of Buddhism too. Like a lot of Buddhisms are just focused on Metta and loving kindness and stuff like that. And like all it's focused on is the— it's not focused on the suffering, it's just focused on the happiness. You know, you don't have to be obsessed with your suffering. Like, you can change it and become happy right now, and the choice is yours. Like, and that— and joining these calls is a method to do that. So it's like, why would you have to I wouldn't say that, oh, if you're not suffering, then you shouldn't be here. No, like, a lot of the interactions I had with my teachers that were the most happy and fulfilling are kind of like a post-ceremony of like the me getting it. Like, it was like a congratulations talk with each other of reporting back like how much it really worked for me. And that was the most heartwarming conversations I've had with my teachers. And they've acknowledged me, and honestly, I guess you can just— I don't want you to take my word for it, but like, I've felt experientially that they acknowledge me understanding what they're saying. You know, you can kind of like get that by social cues and stuff like that. Uh, but like, I, I'm not like— obviously I'm not like a lineage person. Like, I don't think any, any one spiritual teacher would like claim me as their, like, their, their predecessor or whatever. And nor do I plan to do that. I'm much more just like rather be friends with you guys and just be kicking it and be homies.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So you don't have any certificates to show us?

**Speaker B:** I made my own one time in my other server. Like I had— Oh yeah, I saw. Yeah, I had like an other niche community server before I joined this one and I made an enlightenment certificate that anyone who like followed my teaching, like I gave one out to them that they could repost other places on the internet. Uh, it was sort of as like a parody of like going around claiming, uh, enlightenment. Like if you go around on like Discord servers, say, oh, like I'm an Arahant, and you just like get into arguments with people, like that guy's not an Arahant, you know what I mean? Uh, like, so like be careful on the internet, there's a lot of like fake, uh, spiritual teachers out there. Uh, And real spiritual teachings are again verified by direct experience. Does this end my suffering? Does it work? Does it actually take me to happiness? And if it takes you to happiness, then like follow that, you know, follow that to the way, like the way, the truth, and the life.

**Speaker C:** Truth and the Light.

**Speaker B:** Like, whatever method, whatever practice you do, whatever tradition, whatever pointer you're using in that moment, the only recommendation I have is to do it totally and to do it with your whole body and your whole mind. And to fully, fully do it. If it's going to be loving all beings, then it's going to be really feeling the love for everyone and just radiating out that love and just have unconditional love for everyone you could ever think of or imagine or have ever met or have ever experienced. Just in your direct experience, feeling love in your heart, in all of those directions. And sometimes it may be difficult, there may be some resistances in certain directions. And these resistances to those directions is where a lot of the Dukkha is hiding. So the Dukkha often hides most often in our hatred for other people. And if you can let go of all hatred for anyone, anyone who's ever wronged you, or anyone in your life, and you can just forgive them, then you will experience boundless Jhanas of love. Like, you will attain to a boundless Jhana if you do that practice totally, like I'm saying, with your full body and your full mind. Like there is fruits to the path. Like don't get me wrong, there's fruits to the path. But like you have to do it totally. Like it has to be all or nothing type of thing.

**Speaker C:** Developing the theme of loving kindness or goodwill is a wonderful way to get rid of the hindrance of ill will. It doesn't hide in the background. So when you get rid of it, it's comes back, it came back. You didn't— oh, it went away and hid. No, it's not that complicated. The mind is not so complicated. And don't pretend the mind is complicated so we don't have to look at things that we don't want to look at. We start pretending we have no access to them, right?

**Speaker B:** And don't forget that, like, wanting the ill will to go away is just more ill will. Yes, it's ill will towards the ill will.

**Speaker C:** Never stop with more ill will.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so just another reason this moment's not good enough.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if there's hatred for a person, recognize that as not self. Don't judge yourself for it. That's just hating your— don't hate yourself for hating other people. That's just adding more hate to the fire.

**Speaker C:** More fuel.

**Speaker B:** So just stop by hating, start by loving yourself, and then you can love other people too. If you— that's really true. If you love yourself totally, it's not so hard to love other people, even those people who've done you wrong, right? If you love yourself, you can love that, you can learn to love them too.

**Speaker C:** But they know not what they do.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, but if you don't fully love yourself, there's going to be some resistance when, when it comes to those types of uh, uh, areas. And for those who are encountering resistances— yeah, did someone say something?

**Speaker C:** But also, I forgot. My bad, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, I just didn't hear what you're saying. Like, feel free to interrupt.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, no worries. Okay. Okay. For sure.

**Speaker C:** What was I talking about? Whether or not difficulties are encountered because we love ourselves or not.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So if you encounter difficulties with loving other people, the prescription is loving yourself more. So don't try to force the love to the other people. So it's like if you can't get over like what your dad did to you or like what sort of traumatic situation, you don't have to force yourself to like love that person. You just have to love yourself even that much more and love that wounded child within yourself and love the one who's really inside of yourself. Yeah, so once you love the one—.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you know, loving yourself or acceptance of yourself and being able to form the mental fabrication of acceptance of yourself and being able to form confidence and—.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, no. Acceptance of yourself is not a mental fabrication. It's the cessation of a previous fabrication. So when identity view and view of self is broken and you see through that, then acceptance of self is the natural state of reality because there is no self. Of course it accepts it how it is. But until you realize that there's no self, you're not gonna— you're never gonna fully accept yourself. That's the thing. You kind of have to pass. Yeah, so like, there is some— I do like the fetter model because there, there is truth to the fetter model. Like, there is certain levels to it. Like, if you're still attached to personality view, you're not going to have access to like a deeper cultivation of wisdom in your moment-to-moment life. But if you've seen, if you can see really, and the way to develop— Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I didn't quite hear that. Yeah, okay, I think Brett's breaking up a little bit, so I'm just going to continue. But Oh, uh, do you guys remember where I left off? I always forget.

**Speaker C:** We're talking about fetters and the skillful means. Yeah, okay, I know you talked about truth, but we could talk about skillful means.

**Speaker B:** Oh, the fetters. Okay, back to the fetters. Uh, the fetters are interesting because, um, once you have a truly liberating glimpse, uh, the total experience of just like total communion with God, whatever you want to say it, like total unity experience of self and other dissolves. Whether it be through the vehicle of like love, whether it be through the vehicle of Anapanasati, whether it be through the vehicle of a pointer, whether it be through the vehicle of contemplation of impermanence or contemplation of the nature of mind, of the dependent origination of reality, whether it be through that way or simply the relaxation of your body, the combination of all of those skill sets together will annihilate personality view. And once you annihilate personality view, you have substantially upgraded your experience. You don't cling on to things. Things evolve and go there, pass away faster. So like, it's not that you're not going to experience any emotions anymore, but like, you don't hold on to those emotions. So they work through a lot quicker than they did before. Because when you identify with those, there's a self behind those emotions, like there's a self that is depressed, a self that is a certain way, it just perpetuates more of those emotions. So that's the fetter of personality view. Once you realize that it's all just sensory phenomena arising impersonally, then all of it moves through much quicker, and it has a more natural evolution. And you find yourself relaxing a lot more and cultivating a greater sense of ease and well-being.

**Speaker D:** The hindrances certainly become less coarse, but they're available.

**Speaker B:** The hindrances can be developed to the skill where there's no hindrances at all. And that's the skill to be practiced. But there is the potential for the cessation of hindrances if you follow this teaching to its fullest extent.

**Speaker D:** And you're saying that the cessation of hindrances, then the Nivarana would be ceased for one's life, lifelong?

**Speaker B:** Well, no, like it's no longer a relevant question. Nirvana is— let's say you had a nirvana in the past, right? One who's truly awake wouldn't be recalling a nirvana of the past. He would be in this moment, these thoughts, these voices, like my voice talking to you right now, the screen, like this experience of reality unfolding right now. That's nirvana. Not some past experience.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but that's the problem with the pointers is we get mixed up looking at pointers and direct experience. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Anything with words is not Nibbana. Anything with words is not Nibbana. Anything with words is not unconditioned because the very fact that I'm speaking words is conditioned by the fact that other people speak words. So we cannot actually talk about what.

**Speaker B:** A thing is like.

**Speaker C:** We can only tell others how to go that way and then they see it for themselves.

**Speaker B:** Ahipassana.

**Speaker C:** The— it's to be realized individually by the wise.

**Speaker B:** The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And, and, and there's also another quote, uh, by this guy named, uh, Wittgenstein, who said that that which cannot be spoken must be passed over in silence. Mm-hmm. Like that. That's a anything that we can't talk about must be transmitted in silence.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I got a bee. Hold on a second. Hello, bee.

**Speaker D:** We can ramble around it for hours.

**Speaker B:** But there's silence in the rambling. Like, there's pauses, there's a flux to the conversation. So like, I say something and then there's a pause, you know, that pauses the silence.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like a break.

**Speaker B:** It's like music. Yeah, music needs like an elevation and then like a little break. It has a buildup and then a— and then that's kind of how Jhana works. So that's how Jhana is experienced. It's like a rising Piti and feeling. It eventually blossoms and crescendos into a beautiful symphony of ecstasy and bliss. And but that ecstasy and bliss, it's impermanent too. And then eventually there's just nothing. And then that's just what reality is, or that's the eye of God, eye of wisdom, that's God. But then you realize that's everything too. Everything that emerges back from nothing is made out of that same nothingness. And then the experience of the sage is just the movement between the two. Nothingness and somethingness. And the sage goes back and forth and realizes that they're one and the same.

**Speaker C:** I think talking about Jhana is a skillful means for how this is done as well, when we talk about pointing the way. Like you talk about a wibble and a wobble, you talk about vitakka and vichara. This is sustained and directed thought. This is in the first Jhana. Talk about Piti and Sukkha. This is in the first Jhana. We talk about Anicca, Tathagata, Citta, and it's in the first Jhana. These are very good pointers to help us recognize which way we're moving in our experience.

**Speaker B:** Even just understanding, like, the— what the Jhana is comprised of helps to induce the state of Jhana more fully. So, like, if you know— yeah, so, like you're saying, Alexander, like, if you fully understand the actual components and characteristics of each Jhana, like, you're more— you have the tools to actually experience that Jhana more fully. Because you understand it.

**Speaker C:** This is where wisdom in reviewing the Jhana afterwards comes out of.

**Speaker B:** But you still have to put it into practice.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so if you can practice the Jhanas, in the Jhana we may not see exactly what's happening, but we certainly see what's not there. And what's not there is a lot of what you're talking about when you talk about the Ten-Fetter Model. And so we see coming out of jhanas how we construct those fetters between the known and the knower, each and every moment of our existence. So when we let go, we can let go because we see what we're letting go of to be a fabrication. So this is one of the reasons why the Buddha looked to the first jhana and talked about the first jhana being the path. Because when the first jhana is the mode of experiencing reality, it's a little less fabricated, it's a little less this, that, and the other thing. And if we allow the mind to still, you know, if we still vitarka and vichara, which I don't know, a lot of people say directed and sustained thought, I like to say thinking and pondering. So if we allow the mind to still further, thinking and pondering stills, there's just confidence with the object of meditation, and there's just Piti. There's just Sukkha, and that confidence is Ekaggata Citta. That is the collected mind. This is why in Second Jhana we are in a state of Samadhi. First Jhana, we still have some dispersion, not a lot, but just a little bit. That's why it's like a little wibble and a wobble. Vitakka is the mind applied to the object. Vichara is the mind getting comfy with it, you know what I'm saying? Piti and Sukkha come from that. Oh yeah, and they're there, right? And then Ekaggata Citta says fuck everything else. And it goes back to Vitakka and Vikhara, right? And it just goes, and it just makes it real nice.

**Speaker B:** And the hard thing about these, yeah, the dilemma always about these conversations is that we can only really talk in first Jhana. So like, this whole conversation, we're really just doing first Jhana and talking about, like, from first Jhana, I may talk about the latter Jhanas or like even Nibbana. But like, even being able to conceptualize any of that would be by definition not even past first Jhana. Because when you're past first— yeah, when you're past first Jhana, the thinking and examining or pondering thought subsides.

**Speaker C:** We see a big dilemma in Western Buddhism in this conversation right now that is not so much of a dilemma when we know the jhanas like you're talking about, because one of the big discussions is Well, how the fuck do you get insight in Jhana? We can't even— don't do it. Get out of the Jhana. What's not there in the Jhana?

**Speaker B:** You.

**Speaker C:** You're not there in the Jhana. You're fucking gone. So you made yourself up when you came out of the Jhana. If you see this every time, you are no longer a problem. You know what I mean? Does that make sense? Because in Western Buddhism we talk about how do we do this, how do we do it, how could first Jhana this? Oh, how do you see anything in the cessation of perception and feeling? What the fuck? You're not there, so you're not seeing anything. When you stop making stuff up, you stop feeling some kind of way about it.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think what's been really helpful for the way that Dhammarato emphasizes first Jhana is he has a very colloquial way, a relatable way of just saying it's pretty much just like having fun. Like first jhana is not really that different than just having fun.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, not so much, right?

**Speaker B:** Having a laugh, like laughter, having a laugh with your buddies, like taking it easy, like taking a load off. Like first jhana is like really relatable. It's not a far out there experience. Like we all know, we've all experienced it before.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Every— that's like you were saying earlier in the conversation. What I like when these get longer is they start to tie into themselves with whatever they see. In the conversation, you were like, man, first jhana is ordinary, it's normal, it's right here, these things. So it's wonderful to hear, hey, look, now the jhana practice comes back. Yep.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** And now we see kind of like, hey, we directed thought. And so it's great when we see the Sangha as a collection of minds that follow the way of the Buddha, you know what I mean? Because if we know that what exists is the mind and the body, and it's just a continuous stream of mental and physical phenomena, no start, no end, who gives a fuck about that part? Bam, Sangha fits right into it because all we're doing then is a bunch of minds following the path of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** It's just more of the Jhaka and the Chara. It's all just minds. So like my mind is not mine as much as yours is not yours. So it's all just mind happening and there's no like separation between, it's all just the universe's mind, so to speak, unfolding from each of our unique perspectives because it's an infinite multitude of capabilities of being omniscient, omnipresent. Like even Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said some things about God, like, oh yeah, the teaching is all-powerful. It can be found— like the Dhamma is found in everything. Like there's nothing apart from the Dhamma.

**Speaker C:** One of the really wonderful things I think Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did is he had a bunch of people come to him when he was in Thailand, of course, and they said Hey, we're trying to proselytize over here. We want to spread the word of God. We want to have the Bible translated into Thai. So they translated it word for word, first off, English-Thai, you know, and it was terrible. Nobody really liked it. Nobody really understood much of what it was saying. They brought it to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. They asked him, hey, can we get your help with this? You seem like you really know what's going on here, how to talk with these people. And in the Bible, you know, it says that in the beginning there was the word. You know this? So Bhikkhuni translated it In the beginning, there was the Dhamma. And it was a really wonderful way to get the English word point across because as we know, the Dhamma is just phenomena. It's just what is. It's just thusness, right? This is all the Dhamma is just the pointer towards what's really here. Dhamma is a pointer towards truth. So if we say in the beginning, there is just truth.

**Speaker B:** In the beginning, there was just the Dhamma.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** And there was just what it was. It's the beginning, it's the middle, and it's the end. So that's why, to tie it into another theme, is the Dhamma. Good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. So like the Dhamma, in the beginning there was the Dhamma, like it's all been the Dhamma. The Dhamma is what you were before you were born, and it's what you return to after you die. That's Dhamma.

**Speaker C:** This is why the Buddha discovered it. Didn't create it, didn't make it, discovered it. That's why other Buddhas discover it. When Buddhas arise in the world, it has to do with someone recognizing the Dhamma, seeing the Dhamma, being the Dhamma, making their mind the Dhamma. If you make your mind the Dhamma, it's no more problems.

**Speaker B:** Well, any true Buddha will realize that the Buddha is not a person. It's not the Buddha. The Buddha is not this body-mind address. The Buddha is the experience of reality, which is shared by all, shared by you, shared by everyone. That's the Buddha. Not me, the body-mind address, location, physical personality characteristics. That's is not the Buddha. The Buddha is the reality that we all have access to and all like essentially already are. Like, that's, that's just what wisdom wakes up to itself and realizes. If you meet a Buddha on the road, like, kill him, right? Fucking, uh, that's a Zen saying.

**Speaker C:** I never got that one, so It doesn't bother me. I'll probably just have lunch with him and hear all about why he says he's a Buddha.

**Speaker D:** But I get what you're saying.

**Speaker B:** The Zen were extreme. Like, they like to be like— They like their stories. It's like kind of like an exaggerated metaphor about any Buddha that you create that's outside of yourself. Like, you should like get rid of that. Don't worship anyone as a Buddha. Don't hold anyone to be the Buddha. Only hold like your own understanding to be the Buddha. Your own seeing is the Buddha. The Buddha is within you.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha knows the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the Buddha knows the Dharma.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha knows the Dharma. And then if we want to go ahead and give him an address like you're saying, then that's not going to be that way anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Because then he no longer knows the Dhamma, then he knows his address.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker C:** And the Anagami is the Dhamma, but if you're ignorant, you won't see that.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so the Buddha knows the Dhamma. Anything further than that, we're just making more shit up.

**Speaker B:** I think, yeah.

**Speaker D:** I think the phrase killed the Buddha. I think the phrase.

**Speaker B:** Killed the Buddha.

**Speaker D:** And be the instruction, be the Buddha within yourself. That's the practice.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, all of them inside of yourself.

**Speaker B:** The super mundane understanding of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha is that the Buddha is the awakeness to this moment, like just being awake. Buddha means awake. And the Dhamma is everything you're awake to. All that you see is Dhamma. And the Sangha is all of the people within your field of experience is the Sangha. So the Buddha is being awake to this moment. The Dhamma is all that is seen to arise, and the Sangha is everybody that is experienced to arise.

**Speaker C:** What a fun time. Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think this might be a natural good conclusion to the conversation. I really appreciated like the extent of this and I really liked how it looped back in on itself, like you're saying, Alexander.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that was all really enjoyable. So yeah, thank you guys for coming, but obviously feel free to keep talking, but I'm gonna— Thank you. End my, uh, recording. Thank you a lot, man.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, glad to see you, Scott.

**Speaker B:** All right, see y'all later. Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led primarily by **Speaker B (Scott)** with contributions from **Speaker A, C (Alexander), and D**, is a free-flowing, peer-led discussion centered on practical, experiential Buddhism. The tone is informal, personal, and anti-dogmatic.

Here is a summary of the core themes and insights:

### Core Themes & Summary

1.  **The Goal: End Suffering Through Personal Responsibility.** The central purpose of practice is to end personal suffering (*dukkha*). The key insight is that **you have a choice** in every moment to follow a path toward happiness or sorrow. You are not a victim; you are responsible for the suffering you create and can choose to stop creating it.

2.  **Pragmatism Over Dogma.** The ultimate "litmus test" for any teaching or practice is simple: **Is it making your life better and easier?** Does it improve your interactions and reduce conflict? If not, change your approach. The talk is highly critical of rigid models, "enlightenment complexes," and guru worship, favoring authentic, peer-based sharing.

3.  **Ordinary Awakening.** Enlightenment is presented as accessible and ordinary—being fully present in the moment, "chilling under a tree," or doing the dishes with ease. It's not a permanent, superhuman state but a moment-to-moment practice of waking up. **First *Jhāna* is likened to simply "having fun"**—a relatable, natural state of well-being.

4.  **Skillful Means (*Upāya*) and Inclusivity.** The Dhamma (truth) is universal and can be found in all genuine wisdom traditions (Christian mysticism, Zen, etc.). The teachings of the Buddha are seen as a complete "toolkit" or skillful means to realize this truth, not the exclusive property of Buddhism. The Sangha is framed as any group of friends supporting each other on the path.

5.  **The Process: Honesty, Letting Go, and Seeing Cycles.**
    *   **Start with complete honesty** about your present-moment experience, including hindrances and flaws. This self-awareness is wisdom.
    *   **Don't fight experience;** let sensations and hindrances be as they are without adding more judgment (e.g., don't have ill-will toward your ill-will).
    *   The core insight practice is to **see the impersonal cycle of *dukkha* arising and ceasing** within your own mind and body. Understanding this cycle is the alchemy that leads to freedom.

6.  **Deconstruction of Concepts.**
    *   **No-Self & Fetters:** Seeing through "personality view" (the fetter of self-identity) allows experiences to pass through quickly, leading to greater ease. This is a practical outcome, not just a philosophy.
    *   **Jhānas & Nibbāna:** Jhānas are natural states of collected mind. *Nibbāna* (cessation) is the peace found when mental fabrication stops. It is **"right here, right now,"** not a far-off goal. Importantly, any verbal description is just a pointer; the truth must be realized directly.
    *   **Refuge:** The ultimate refuge is internal: the **Buddha** as your own awakeness, the **Dhamma** as the reality you're awake to, and the **Sangha** as all beings in your experience.

### Key Takeaways & Quotes

*   **On Practice:** "The path to happiness is happiness itself."
*   **On Testing Truth:** "Does this end my suffering? Does it work?... follow that."
*   **On Awakening:** "Enlightenment is very ordinary. It's just moment-to-moment, sensate reality. Just this."
*   **On Community:** The preferred model is not a guru-student hierarchy but friends "kicking it and being homies," sharing wisdom to help each other remember.
*   **On Hindrances:** "The desire to get rid of desire is still desire." Accept what is present without adding a second layer of resistance.

In essence, this talk advocates for a **pragmatic, choice-based, and deeply personal path** out of suffering. It emphasizes direct experience over belief, personal responsibility over devotion, and finds the profound in the utterly ordinary. The spirit is one of open-hearted exploration among friends, using the Dhamma as a practical guide to a happier, easier life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich and wide-ranging conversation, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Sickness, Breaking, and Fading:** Used at the start to point to **impermanence, aging, and suffering (dukkha)**. Examples: a breaking webcam, a bad hip.
2.  **The Litmus Test:** A recurring metaphor for measuring spiritual progress. True practice makes your life **easier and improves interactions**; if you're in more conflict, your mind is creating it.
3.  **Reality as a Subjective Creation:** The mind creates your reality—you can make it **"your own living hell or your own paradise on earth."** The choice is yours each moment.
4.  **The Path/Fork in the Road:** A central metaphor for **moment-to-moment choice** between a path of happiness (wisdom) and a path of sorrow (ignorance). It's not a one-time choice but a continuous practice.
5.  **Ignorance as an Intruder:** Ignorance can be kicked out the front door but **slithers back in through an open window or back door**. You must constantly be vigilant to "close the windows."
6.  **The Fool Who Knows He's a Fool:** A reference (attributed to Shakespeare) to illustrate that **self-awareness of one's flaws is itself a form of wisdom**. Denial is a greater trap.
7.  **The Clogged Sink:** A detailed story about a sink drain clogged with hair, causing water to pool and bubbles to rise. **Pulling out the clog** allows the water to drain smoothly. This represents removing mental hindrances to allow experience to flow clearly without obstruction (the "bubbles" of disturbance).
8.  **The Raft to the Other Shore:** A classic Buddhist metaphor referenced here. You must **build your own raft** (practice) to cross from the shore of suffering to the shore of well-being. No one can do it for you.
9.  **The CEO/Commander-in-Chief of Your Path:** You are ultimately responsible for your own spiritual journey and awareness.
10. **The T-Shirt (and Branding):** Spiritual identities (like a branded t-shirt) can become attachments. Advanced practice is like wearing a **blank white t-shirt**—having no attached identity—or being able to wear any "shirt" (play any role) without attachment.
11. **The Party on the Other Shore:** A friendly variation of the raft metaphor. Someone standing on the "well-being shore" calls out, **"The party's nice over here, come join!"**
12. **Music and Jhana:** The experience of Jhana (meditative absorption) is compared to **music**—it has a buildup, a crescendo of bliss (Piti), and then pauses/silence. The sage's experience is the movement between the "somethingness" (form) and "nothingness" (emptiness), like the notes and the rests.
13. **The Room for God:** From Christian mysticism. **Your mind must be emptied** of clutter (thoughts, fixed ideas) for God (or ultimate reality) to enter. This parallels the Buddhist teaching of emptying the mind.

### **Implied Stories & Cultural References**

1.  **The "Spiritual Person" Identity as a Trap:** The story of people who, to avoid ego death, **latch fiercely onto a spiritual identity**, leading to an "enlightenment complex" and claims of superiority ("I realize I'm Jesus Christ...").
2.  **The Guru/Student Dynamic:** A personal story about having a heartwarming connection with a teacher but ultimately **wanting to become his own teacher**, not a perpetual student. This contrasts with "weird guru cults."
3.  **The "Catatonic Zombie" Attainment:** A critique of seeking extreme states like being in *Nirodha Samapatti* (cessation) for 10 days. The speaker questions its utility: **"Who are you going to help with that?"** True awakening is presented as more ordinary and human.
4.  **The Recovering Catholic:** A personal reference to being **"traumatized by Catholicism"** and its rules, which contrasts with the teaching of getting rid of rules for happiness.
5.  **The Enlightenment Certificate Parody:** A story about making a fake "enlightenment certificate" in an online community as a **parody of internet gurus** who claim supreme attainments and argue about them.
6.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the Bible Translation:** A story about the Thai monk helping Christians translate the Bible. He rendered "In the beginning was the Word" as **"In the beginning was the Dhamma,"** beautifully linking the concepts of ultimate truth across traditions.
7.  **"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him."** A referenced Zen koan used to emphasize that **any conceptual Buddha outside yourself is an idol**. The true Buddha is your own understanding and awakeness.

### **Overarching Narrative**
The talk itself **becomes a metaphor** for the practice. The speakers note how the conversation naturally **"looped back in on itself,"** tying earlier themes (like the ordinary nature of first Jhana) to later ones. This mirrors the path—**returning again and again to core insights** from different angles, in a supportive "Sangha" of friends talking as equals, not as a teacher on a high horse. The dialogue *is* the practice of remembering and pointing each other back to "how things are."
