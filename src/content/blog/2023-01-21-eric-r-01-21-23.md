### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, Eric. By the way, it's really good to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the point that we were in was, is that when we begin to practice, and practicing in the sense of being in the here-now, then the breathing— because we're in seclusion, there's not a lot of stuff happening, and so we pay attention to what is happening, like our breathing and our thoughts, our feelings, the mood we're in, the states of mind that we have, etc., like that. And then the idea of that is that when we're practicing on the inside and begin to see what's there and become familiar with it, that we actually become friends with ourselves. We start nurturing, we intentionally nurture We intentionally accept ourselves, warts and all, so that we can actually see what's going on, see the Dukkha, because if we can't see it, we can't change it. And if we don't want to see it because we don't like it, then we can't see it. Okay, so that's the one side, is when we're alone, we pay attention to the body, we pay attention to the breathing, we pay attention to the senses, and we pay attention to the feelings, the states of mind, right? The Anapanasati. All right, so when we go out in public, now we have a whole lot more sensory input to deal with. That when we're in a conversation like the two of us now, instead of just paying attention to your breathing and just paying attention to the thoughts and the states of mind that you're in. You've got this new input, which is my image and my voice. And so now what we can say is that the duty to the Dharma, our obligation when we're in seclusion to pay attention to what's happening, that means that when we're in conversation with someone, we actually have a duty to listen and to look, to pay close attention to the other person. Whether we're talking or whether we're actually listening, looking at the person, paying attention to them, is part of the practice. Okay, and you've got fairly good eye contact. I see a lot of students who will be looking down like that and then looking up. In fact, where the eyes are looking and which way the face is pointing is quite telling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very good.

**Speaker A:** And so that's one of the things that I did want to say to you on the video, is to congratulate you for actually paying attention, because that makes a good listener, and good listeners then make good friends. That you don't have to talk a lot to be good friends, that if you listen to what people say, they will feel greatly grateful for that.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I know how to be a good friend. I just don't feel motivated to be friendly towards most of people.

**Speaker A:** Towards who?

**Speaker B:** Most of the people.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the other side of it. Most of the people are not worthy of your friendship. Okay, um, when I say it like that, that sounds strange, but Jesus said it directly when he says don't put your pearls before the swine.

**Speaker B:** All right, and how do you reconcile that with, uh, make friends everywhere you go?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, but you're not going to make deep long-lasting friendships with people who are trying to take advantage of you or wanting things from you or whatever like that. That in fact, this is where it comes into gaining noble friends, that if you can find people that already have learned the Dhamma on the inside, now the two of you or the group can practice being friendly on the outside. Just like you've been practicing being friendly to yourself on the inside. This is why we're looking for noble Sangha. And that I imagine that it's possible that it's— that there are many, many different groups. I could imagine that in fact within a military, this is what they want to have within the platoon. They want that platoon to be cohesive. They want those guys to care about one another, so if one of them gets wounded, 2 or 3 of them are going to go out in a hail of bullets and grab that guy and bring him back into the trench or something like that. That they do want that small group to have that cohesion. All right, but it's hard for a DI to teach that. It's almost like a secondary kind of thing that hopefully the platoon will learn to depend upon one another. But that doesn't happen. Maybe in fact the intensity of battle is what brings that camaraderie together. Then in fact, you've heard about it, is that guys who were Army buddies together, they tend to be really close lifelong friends. Because they actually were in the heat of the battle able to merge into a Sangha. All right, they did it naturally, they did it ignorantly. What we're doing is in fact doing it wisely, intentionally joining that Sangha, intentionally making friends, helping each other. And so whenever people come and say they're thinking about coming to Thailand, I want to be there for them. Yeah, come stay on my porch, eat my food here. I'll take you to this place and that place and that kind of thing to be really close to one another.

**Speaker B:** Actually, I want to start planning my trip to Thailand, but maybe that's too much of a tangent.

**Speaker A:** Oh, well, yeah, I'll come.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I need a— I need a visa, and to get a visa to Thailand, I would have to go to Mexico, but I need a visa to Mexico too.

**Speaker A:** No, all we need to come into Thailand now is a shot record for the COVID A shot record to make sure that you've got the COVID That's the thing that the Thai government cares about. But entry visas or tourist visas can be had at the entry point. Now, especially if you fly in, which is the way that almost all Westerners would come to Thailand. So you can come into Thailand and get a visa right then and there. And I think it is good for 45 days.

**Speaker B:** Are you sure that that applies to every nationality?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I checked and they tend to be strict with non-first world countries.

**Speaker A:** You could probably find that out on the internet by going to the Thai embassy and see if there's any national restrictions, but I don't think so. I don't think that Thailand plays that kind of politics so much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what I found online is that the embassy that I would have to apply to is Mexico. So I would have to get through that hurdle to get first the Mexican visa to get an interview in the Thai embassy at Mexico and then get my visa approved. But if you hear that the other thing what you're saying is possible, then that'd be nice. And then if not, then I would also like to know about how to go about getting like a recommendation or an invitation from an Arhat to apply for an this other type of visa?

**Speaker A:** We're actually working on that. I don't think that you would need to have an invitation. I've never heard anybody needing an invitation to come to Thailand from a wat. It's more that once you're in Thailand, uh, the wat that you're at will then help you to get the longer-term religious visas. But you have to be there established. But I have not heard anybody say anything about that. Thailand doesn't allow certain South American countries' people to come.

**Speaker B:** I'm not saying not allowed. I'm just saying that I don't think that it's possible to get the entry visa at the border or at the airport.

**Speaker A:** Well, last year that was true, but they've changed the visa laws. And I have seen, basically, I haven't really cared much about what country that they've come from, but I've seen probably a dozen people now who have come in with no visa at all and get their visa stamped right there at the border or right there at the airport. No visa necessary.

**Speaker B:** That's good.

**Speaker A:** Now, that's for the— that's for a tourist visa, is a short-term visa. It can be extended without leaving the country. But a more permanent visa is called a non-immigrant visa. In fact, I don't even think that they have an immigrant visa for Thailand, but the non-immigrant visa means is that it's a longer term, and those would be business or work or education, religion, retirement, uh, and marriage, I think, would be the, uh, the various ways for those longer visas. And that one you would have to get at an embassy outside of Malaysia or outside of Thailand. And so people up in North Thailand, they go to Laos to Vientiane, and then depending upon where in South Thailand you are, they either go to Burma or go to Malaysia. And over in the east, they would go to Cambodia to get the visa, okay? And that would be a non-immigrant visa, and they're good for 3 months and can be extended, okay, permanently. So that, you know, in fact, to be honest with you, I have not left Thailand now in 11 years. I have not been outside of Thailand in 11 years. And so that's, uh, that shows that the visas kind of work. We have to meet all of the points. But yes, come, come find Sangha, come find community, come be with the folks. That's the thing. And that because of your location, there's not very many Asian Watts around. But for most people, like in the States or in Europe, I would recommend you don't have to come to Thailand, that you can in fact find what you're looking for in the country that you're in. But for your situation and having to travel, it's probably about the same cost to come to Thailand as it would be to go to Mexico.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, what would determine that is like the— where it is easier to do restrictions. Less restrictions. Like if I get a visa to the States, I would plan to join a wat in the States for a while, or maybe the easiest would be to find one in Europe. But if Thailand is viable, then I think I would rather go.

**Speaker A:** Right. And not only that, but it's much cheaper. It's much easier to live. That money in Thailand is a different commodity than the almighty dollar in the West or the euro. And so yeah, if you have to go travel anyway, then Thailand is for sure the best way to come. And more and more people are thinking about coming, and right now we have several that are staying. Uh, that's great, right? And in fact, Laurant, um, has already spent the 30— the 45 days, and now the 30 days. And now we're working with immigration to see whether they can stay or do they have to go to Malaysia to get the visa. Uh, yeah, there's a— there's a lot. Actually, a lot of guys also come to Thailand and then go back because they didn't leave completely clean in the first place. And there's nothing wrong with that. That in fact, um, it took me 4 trips to India before I fully committed to staying in Asia.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I would be doing that too. I have to figure out, uh, what to do with my cats, leave some money or stuff for my parents and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you would need some money. I would say that the cost of the plane ticket plus probably about $5,000 would be enough to give you complete comfort that you can handle anything for a long time. Because after you, you know, first off is that you learn to get really frugal so that you don't spend a lot of money. And so you wind up, the only money that we're spending is for visas. And then we kind of figure that out and get a better visa. And then you don't need so much money. That rent, even like this house, this house we got, there's 6 people live in this house. It's a really nice house. And it is about $190 a month. And that includes the water, the electricity and everything. Wow.

**Speaker B:** That'S nice.

**Speaker A:** And so that's pretty cheap. Yeah, but, uh, in the old days I would go from one retreat center to another, or spending time in Wat Soan Mokkh that first time. And always would stop in the late afternoon and meet the monks and then spend the night at a wat. So I've been in a lot of different wats long before I was at Wat Soan Mook, but I did that because of the free cheap rent. And so yeah, you can get free or cheap rent easy. Another thing that I would do was when I would arrange for transportation, I would always arrange for a night train or a night boat or whatever like that, just so I didn't have to have a room, that the room was the traveling also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's too extreme.

**Speaker A:** And so I learned how to be really cheap, really frugal that way. And so you don't really need that much money for the long term, just enough to get the visa thing straightened out, and then we can handle it. And if you stay at a wat, and especially if you ordain and stay at a wat, then they will take care of the visa for you. In fact, Thailand has gotten really easy. In the old days, getting a religious visa took some work. Now all I've heard is, is that they'll stamp it. All you need to do is to get like Ajahn Po's signature on that piece of paper that they send out. Here, go get him to sign this, and he— we bring that back with his signature, and they know him, and they'll give you a year's visa right then and there. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Oh, then I'll focus on saving some money, and then we'll talk.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah, save some money up and then you can do it. But meanwhile, back to the point that we were talking about, and that is the idea of Sangha, is that to come and find some noble friends to be with, because ordinary friends will kind of drag you down into their, to their level. And what we want is to be around people who are going to uplift us and bring us up up to their level.

**Speaker B:** What I find also is that you can, or I can find things that I admire in everyday people, or yeah, not necessarily Dharma friends. And in that way, like focusing on that, they bring me up in that thing that I admire about them.

**Speaker A:** Right, absolutely. So find admirable friends. No, I mean, yes, find friends that you can admire. That's what we're talking about. But don't you do that? Well, everybody has some admirable qualities. Yeah, the question is, is what are they distributing, or what are they exhibiting right now? Are they actually being friendly, or are they being selfish? Or are they being remorseful? That's the question. And the answer to that is, pay attention. Look closely. Find things in other people that you admire, and tell them so.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking that what I just said may appear contradictory to the What I was saying before, that I don't really— I'm not really friendly to most people, but I was referring to the fact that like most of my friends, or really all my friends that I feel close to, are not Dhamma friends. And I wouldn't say that I feel I'm better than them. No, I feel like a little in a noble way, but Um, yeah, I— a little in, in the Dharma sense, but not in general as person. I see them as equals, you know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, one of the things that we have to understand is, is that there is a time and a place for teaching the Dhamma, and that there is a certain kind of time and a place where it's not good. And let me give you an example of that. You've heard of the Salvation Army? Okay, so one of the things that the Salvation Army does is they have a meal. They feed the people that come to their meetings, and then they have the meeting. That if somebody comes for to the Salvation Army and that they're hungry and they find no food there, then they'll go someplace else. So that's the beginning of the— that you give people what they need. And so when someone is in grief, the Dhamma dude does not try to teach them the Dhamma in the sense of how to not grieve. But rather they teach it in the way of solving the immediate problem, to deal with the grief. And after the person is finished with their grief, when they get fed for that, then later we can teach them how to not grieve. But while someone is grieving, We can't teach them how to not grieve. We have to help them with their grief right now. The same thing is true with misery. The same thing is true with anger. The same thing is true with fear. That with ordinary people, you have to deal with them in whatever situation that they're in. Now, if that ordinary person is in a state where you have admiration for them then how to deal with that is by telling them so, is to let them know that you appreciate their admirable qualities. So that's the way of always taking it in the here-now, to deal with people the way that they are. And sometimes ordinary people are going to show you admirable qualities, but when you're around nobles, that's basically about all you're going to get from them is their admirable qualities. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I guess that I wouldn't— I can't imagine yet what it's like to live in a noble community. Like, since I haven't experienced it, I don't— I can't imagine the benefit of it.

**Speaker A:** Well, come, make friends. That's one of the disadvantages, by the way, of the retreats, is because the style of the retreat is, is that everybody comes and is in silence. You might be able to say hello on the first day and say hello on the end of the day, or the end of the retreat, but you're prevented from making any close connections with anybody in the retreat because the retreat is the place to go get one's own mind straightened out. And so there is no concept or possibility of Sangha within a retreat. Perhaps that's something that we should in fact start looking at, is how can we have a retreat to where silence is not a part of it, that in fact sharing and becoming friends, as well as practicing, is actually what we're looking for. And so we could do that kind of a retreat, but nobody is doing any retreats like that. That's actually— that kind of retreat would be closer to what is referred to in psychology is group therapy, that we could actually do it in a group.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's, um, uh, the way that we're looking at things now is that let's get our insides fixed up and straightened out, get ourselves nourished, to get ourselves, uh, uh, in the right attitude, get our mojo going, and then we can carry that into the community. And so that's where Metta comes in. Metta is giving away gifts that you actually have, but the way that Metta is practiced in the West is the practice of pretending to give gifts that you pretend to have, or maybe don't have. If you don't have Metta, how can you hope for all beings to be happy, when you're not happy yourself? No, we have to say, instead of "May all beings be happy," let's have the beings around us that we can influence, let's help them be happy. And so we become part of that Sangha that way, in the sense of helping others, to come out of their misery, to come out of their anger, and to come into nourishment, even though they don't have a practice at least. And then people like to be around you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's something that's easier to pay attention to, like how your moods are syncing with the other person. I was listening to a podcast on that. It's specifically like how the balance between the activation of the sympathetic, of the parasympathetic systems, how they balance between the people that are interacting, that it creates that sense of social comfort. Yeah, I don't know, just looking at the person and maybe try to imagine a bit what they're feeling and try to match it in a way that's going in a positive direction.

**Speaker A:** Actually, there's an important point, and I've gotten this point from both Ajahn Po and the Dhamma, as well as in psychology. And that is we really don't know what's happening inside a person. We really don't know how they feel, but what we do know is their behavior. And so let's pay close attention to the behavior because that will give us insights into how they feel. But that doesn't mean that we know, it just means that we can see them behaving in a certain way. Yeah, and most of that is going to be on the face. Are they smiling or are they frowning? Are they looking away or do they hold eye contact? Do their eyes flitter around when they're thinking, or can they stay focused while they're talking? And so that's— but in fact, by doing that, by beginning to watch other people's faces, it also helps us to become more aware of our own face and how we present ourselves to others. That we're not scatterbrained, we're not flittering with the eyes around, we're not looking down. But we're here now looking, and that's something that I also will say that I've noticed that about you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because you, you can keep your eyes focused and, and straight. Not everybody can do that.

**Speaker B:** No, still, like, I, I like to, to look Another way when I'm not sure about what I'm going to say, because if I'm not sure what I'm going to say, I look straight at the other person, then I focus more on the face and I can't focus on thinking what I want to say. But yeah, to me it's not about maybe inattention, but maybe lack of fluency. In speech.

**Speaker A:** Lack of what?

**Speaker B:** Fluency.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. So in fact, paying attention to other people's faces and paying attention to what they say will help that fluidity in the sense of let's not go off into what we want to think and what we're going to say and all of that. Let's stay focused on what's happening right now. That when it's— when it comes your turn to talk, all you have to do is to remember kind of the last thing that they said, and off you go with that. That while they're speaking, while they're talking for, let us say, a whole minute, they'll say a whole lot of stuff, and you don't have to grab on one of those things and then run with it in your own mind and not listen to the last 30 seconds that they're saying. We don't have to plan on what we're saying. And so all you have to do is listen to the last thing that they say, in the sense of, now I know what I'm going to talk about. And so that happens again right there in the moment. We don't have to plan in advance. When people are planning in advance what they're going to say next, they're not really listening to what the other person is saying. They're not really paying attention to them. Instead, what we're doing is thinking about what I'm going to say next. And if you're quiet like you are, then that means that you have a much better chance of listening anyway, because you're not jumping ready to talk. You just let them talk for a while. All right, now in a way, in fact directly so, this is Anapanasati right then and there when you're with another person. Let's pay attention to them. Let's listen to them. Let's look at them. This is your object of meditation, is that other person right there in front of you. They're Sangha, they're your friends, they're your reality right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I can play with that. Yeah, you can play with it.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right, well, I've got another guy calling, so why don't we finish this conversation? It's been a really good one. We've lasted about an hour, but we only recorded about 30 minutes of it. So, uh, that's fine. This has been great. Eric, I'm really glad to have you as a friend.

**Speaker B:** Me too, Dhammarato. Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you later. Thanks for calling.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Eric (Speaker B), explores the integration of meditation practice with social life, the importance of noble friendship (Sangha), and practical advice for spiritual travel. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **Core Dhamma Teaching: From Solitary Practice to Social Practice**
1.  **Inner Practice (Seclusion):** The foundation is mindfulness in solitude—paying attention to breathing, body, feelings, and states of mind (Anapanasati). The aim is to become a "friend to oneself" through acceptance and non-judgmental observation, which allows us to see and understand *dukkha* (suffering/stress).
2.  **Outer Practice (In Relationship):** When in conversation, the "duty" of practice shifts from internal observation to **fully attending to the other person**—listening deeply and maintaining mindful eye contact. This attentive presence is presented as a form of meditation where the other person becomes the object of mindfulness. It fosters genuine connection and is the basis for good friendship.

### **The Importance of Noble Friendship (Sangha)**
*   Dhammarato emphasizes seeking out **"noble friends"**—those who are also practicing the Dhamma and can uplift you. While you can admire qualities in anyone, ordinary friendships can sometimes be draining or lack mutual spiritual growth.
*   A true **Sangha (spiritual community)** is where you can intentionally practice friendliness (*metta*) externally, just as you practice self-acceptance internally. This community provides support and shared aspiration.
*   He critiques traditional silent retreats for inhibiting the formation of such connections and suggests a need for retreat models that combine practice with community building.

### **Practical Guidance on Visiting Thailand**
A significant portion of the talk becomes a practical discussion about Eric's potential trip to Thailand to find Sangha:
*   **Visa Advice:** Dhammarato explains that tourist visas (45 days) are often available on arrival, while longer-term "non-immigrant" visas (e.g., for religion, retirement) require a visit to a Thai embassy in a neighboring country. He notes that temples (*wats*) can often help with religious visas once you are there.
*   **Cost of Living:** Life in Thailand is presented as frugal and affordable (e.g., shared housing for very low rent), making it an attractive destination for sustained practice.
*   **Encouragement:** Dhammarato warmly encourages Eric to save money and come, highlighting Thailand as a cost-effective hub with an existing community of practitioners.

### **Key Insights on Interpersonal Mindfulness**
*   **Focus on Behavior, Not Assumptions:** We can't know others' inner feelings, but we can mindfully observe their behavior (facial expressions, eye contact, posture) to better understand and connect with them.
*   **Listen Without Planning:** True listening means not formulating your response while the other person is speaking. Instead, be fully present and let your response arise naturally from the last thing they said.
*   **Appreciate Admirable Qualities:** Actively look for and verbally appreciate admirable qualities in others, which strengthens connections and positivity.
*   **Teach Dhamma Appropriately:** The Dhamma should be shared skillfully. When someone is in grief, anger, or fear, the immediate duty is to offer comfort and help with that emotion, not to lecture on non-attachment.

### **Conclusion**
The talk circles back to the central theme: the practice of Dhamma seamlessly moves from the cushion into relationships. By making the other person our meditation object—listening and looking with full attention—we build **Sangha** in the moment. This mindful engagement is the pathway to developing genuine, nourishing friendships that support the spiritual path. The discussion concludes with Dhammarato affirming his friendship with Eric and encouraging him to "play with" this practice of mindful relating.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Metaphor of "Inner and Outer Friendship"**
   *   **Inner Friendship:** The practice of mindfulness (paying attention to breath, thoughts, feelings) in seclusion is described as "becoming friends with ourselves." This involves self-acceptance ("warts and all") and nurturing, which is the foundation.
   *   **Outer Friendship:** This inner practice is then extended to social interaction. Paying close attention to another person (listening, eye contact) is framed as the same duty of mindfulness, just directed outward. Good listeners "make good friends."

**2. The "Pearls Before Swine" Metaphor (Biblical Allusion)**
   *   Speaker A directly references the saying attributed to Jesus ("do not put your pearls before swine") to illustrate that deep friendship and Dharma sharing should be reserved for receptive, "noble" people, not wasted on those who might take advantage or are not interested.

**3. The Military Camaraderie Story**
   *   Speaker A uses the story of a military platoon to illustrate the power and value of a tight-knit community ("Sangha"). He describes how soldiers in battle develop intense, lifelong bonds because they must depend on each other for survival. This is presented as an intense, "ignorant" (unintentional) version of what a spiritual community does "wisely" and "intentionally."

**4. The "Salvation Army Meal" Metaphor/Analogy**
   *   This is used to explain the appropriate timing for teaching Dharma. Just as the Salvation Army feeds people physically *before* holding a religious meeting, you must address a person's immediate emotional state (grief, anger, fear) *before* you can teach them how to overcome such states. You "give people what they need" in the moment.

**5. The Metaphor of "Levels" (Uplifting vs. Dragging Down)**
   *   Noble friends are described as those who "uplift us and bring us up to their level." In contrast, ordinary friends might "drag you down into their level." This creates a vertical metaphor for spiritual influence.

**6. The "Retreat as Repair Shop" Metaphor**
   *   Silent retreats are implicitly compared to a place for individual repair ("get our insides fixed up," "get our mojo going"). The speaker contrasts this with the idea of a different kind of retreat focused on building community, which he likens to "group therapy."

**7. The "Metta as Real Gift" Metaphor**
   *   The common loving-kindness meditation phrase "May all beings be happy" is critiqued as "pretending to give gifts that you pretend to have." True *metta* (loving-kindness) is reframed as giving **actual** help and happiness to the beings immediately around you, based on the well-being you have genuinely cultivated within yourself.

**8. The "Object of Meditation" Metaphor**
   *   In conversation, the other person is explicitly called the "object of meditation." Just as the breath is the object in formal *ānāpānasati*, in dialogue, paying full attention to the other person becomes the focal point of the practice.

**Summary:** The talk uses metaphors of **friendship** (inner/outer, noble/ordinary), **community building** (military, Sangha), **practical aid** (Salvation Army meal), and **spiritual economy** (pearls before swine, real gifts) to bridge the gap between solitary meditation practice and engaged, compassionate relationships. The stories and analogies ground the Dharma in practical social dynamics.
