### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Welcome, friends. It's Saturday morning in Thailand, or Friday evening in the US. And today, let us give a name to the topic and then talk about what we mean by it. Paul Simon had a song that is known as Slip Sliding Away. I don't know if any of you are old enough for that song. But you can actually get everything out of it by just hearing that phrase slip, sliding away. And that's what happens to the mind when we start to practice. We can have wholesome thoughts, and immediately those wholesome thoughts will slip and then slide away. Uh, this is why it's so important for an actual practice, is because, um, we continuously are going back and forth. If in fact we're beginning to practice, we go back and forth, mostly, uh, the mind, uh, from, uh, a new person, an untrained, uh, student is in constant state of slipping around, sliding away, no focus, going from one thing to another. When students say that they can't study, what they're really meaning is that the mind is slipping and sliding away around whatever topic that they're intending to study. But in fact, they can stay focused on a game, mostly because the games have instant benefit. Whatever game it is, if you shoot a character, you get that good feeling of winning the game. But when you're reading a textbook, just because the eyes are pouring across the words The mind doesn't stay focused on that. That in fact, the mind slips, slips around. The example that I would give to see if everybody knows what we're talking about— have you actually ever read an article? Maybe it was on the internet or in a book, reading a book. You get to the bottom of the page. And you recognize that the eyes went over and saw every word, but very little of it came in. That will read one sentence and then start thinking about the sentence, and now the mind has slipped away, and yet the eyes are continuing along the page reading, and yet the mind's not paying attention because it slipped away. I'll also mention that just recently someone said that they can't focus, they can't practice, that they have no control over the mind. And that's simply not true, because in fact they can— everyone can play a game. We can drive a car well enough that we're not killing everybody, every hour that we're out on the road, that we can pay some attention. And so it's not true when people say that they've got no control. Another example would be that people think that they have no control over their feelings, and yet we tell children to stop crying, to buck up, and it takes them a little bit But they can do that. Another example is that you're in the waiting room of, let us say, a bus station or a hospital, and you want to see the doctor right bloody now. You want that bus to come so I can get on that bus right now, not recognizing that once you get on the bus, now you got to sit on the bus for those hours. Or that when you're in the doctor's office wanting to hurry up and get to the doctor, he may give you a shot. So why are you in a hurry to get into the doctor? But instead of banging down the door and going to the doctor immediately because we want that, we are in fact able to restrain ourselves. We are in fact able to just sit there. We may not like it, we may be in bad feelings, but we can control ourselves. If you can understand that you can control yourself in those kind of ordinary ways, that means that you can, you can practice the Dharma correctly. Isn't that amazing, Alex, that you can practice? Yeah, the mind wants to slip and slide away, you can bring it back.

**Speaker B:** How nice that is.

**Speaker A:** So now we can talk about it in the sense of that this is what we really need for correct practice. I've seen a lot of people come on Discord and talk about it, and it's like they understand how to practice. They're getting great benefit from the Dharma because they're listening to the Dharma, they're hearing the Dharma, but they really are not practicing, that practice is what is needed because the mind is so slippery. It does slip and slide away, and that the practice, the correct practice, is to see it slipping and sliding away. Can you see it slipping and sliding away? If you can see it slipping and sliding away, That's good practice. If you can see it slipping and sliding away, that means that you're catching it very early. Almost none of the new people who start to practice can see it slip, slide away. They can only see it if it's gone. They can't see the slipping and sliding. So what generally happens is somebody will start to practice correctly by having intentionally a wholesome thought, and then the next thought immediately is going to be an unwholesome thought. They begin to slip right after the first wholesome thought. It will start to slip right then. And so we need to practice over and over and over, having one wholesome thought after another, after another, after another, checking intently to see that after that third or that fourth wholesome thought, the mind's going to slip, slide away. And so you keep bringing it back and bringing it back and bringing it back. This is an actual practice that needs to be performed on a regular basis so that you in fact can take much better control of your mind, much better control. But in fact, if you take control of your mind, you can in fact begin to change the underlying mind states. There are— the mind can be seen as in two different ways. One is the instantaneous, moment-by-moment changes of the mind, the slipping, the sliding, the focus, or whatever, that would be Dhammanupassana, which is what's happening right now. But underlying that is an attitude, it's a state of mind. And so we can begin to pay attention to what kind of state of mind what state the mind is in. Is the mind in a state of sharpness, focus? Is it dull? Is it poor me? Is it exalted? Is it a winner's attitude or a loser's attitude? And we have choices over this, but we almost never know that we've got choices because the mind is more than likely, if you're not paying attention, going to slip, slide away right back into an unwholesome mind state. And we have various words that we can use for that. An example would be the word hard. If you say meditation is hard, what that means is that you're being hard on yourself, because that's the hindrance, is that you don't like what's going on. In the moment rather than happily, joyfully keep bringing the mind back from that sliding away position. Over and over and over again, we need to practice. It would also be good for us to set up a schedule, and that schedule then would be, uh, Let us say that we could use our cell phone to good advantage. In fact, I see that there are quite a lot of applications that are on cell phones to help with what they call meditation. I think that even Sam Harris has an app. But really, the only app that you need is the alarm clock. And you can set it for 1 hour so that the alarm goes off every hour. Or as your practice improves, you can set it to every 30 minutes or every 15 minutes with the idea that when that cell phone call rings, when the alarm goes off, that's a reminder to start practicing again, to start practicing again, even if it's nothing more than taking a deep breath with the thought of don't worry, be happy. Have that happy thought. Don't worry, be happy. Everything is okay. And then we can go back to what we were doing. Now, if we, if we have that thought of don't worry, be happy, taking a deep breath, and we do that once every 4 or 5 days, it's not going to catch on. If we do it even once a day, then it's going to be catching on very slowly. But if we can do that once an hour, then you're going to start making progress. You can remember to do it, and you can use the, the cell phone as a memory aid. That back in the time of the Buddha, they didn't have cell phones, they didn't have alarm clocks. They didn't even— in fact, uh, you could say that it's doubtful that they could even put a stick in the ground and turn it into a, um, a sundial. You're not sure that in fact the first levels of sundials that we have would be out of the Roman Empire. And so they didn't have a method the way that we would think of it. However, they did have something, and that would be a joss stick or an incense stick, that the incense sticks would run for about 20 minutes. And so when the incense stick or the joss stick burns out, burns down and goes out, it doesn't smoke anymore. And the mosquitoes are standing there on the leaves of the trees waiting for the smoke to stop so that they can nosedive right into you. So this is something that is used in the Thai watch. In fact, it's very common for laypeople to give incense sticks or joss sticks to the, to the monks as part of the standard package. In fact, the 3 things that are most often given as a standard package would be, uh, the joss sticks, candle, and lotus bud. Now, the lotus buds are, uh, a lot of people don't know, but lotus buds are, uh, a little bit before they're opened up into a flower, they're slightly hallucinogenic. This is not talked about any place in the sutras, but it is talked about in ancient Greek mythology, where Odysseus, in his getting back from Troy, getting back to Greece, he actually ran across the lotus eaters. Which were crazy people. And so this is something that's given to the monks, but most monks don't eat those lotus buds. I think it's because they've forgotten that it's got a nice hit on it, but they do use the candles and they do use the joss sticks. Now, a side point is, is that if monks use joss sticks and use candles, that means that it's part of the culture to use fire. And so there's fire-making equipment and all kinds of things that the monks would use. Nowadays they just use a lighter, a pie chat. And so getting back to the point about the the joss sticks, that was a kind of value of a timer so that when the joss stick went out and the mosquitoes come back, the monk would mindfully light another joss stick and start to practice. Now, the mind being what the mind is, generally runs away. It slips and slides away. Um, it's kind of interesting that because of things that were happening in Burma, uh, during the 1950s, they settled on 45 minutes to an hour sitting. Goenka would recommend to sit for an hour. Well, guess what? Nobody can do that. You can't— in the beginning at least, you cannot have one full an hour of wholesome thoughts. It's not possible. The mind will slip and slide away hundreds of times or more during that hour. We don't have that kind of focus. If you're writing a book and you get a page or two done, maybe an hour or so, the mind will go into what is often referred to as writer's block. And almost all the writers then will sit there with that block and fuss and slide away. The right thing to do when writer's block comes is to set the pad down and go away from that article and get the mind back into a wholesome state again, and then go back and do the.

**Speaker C:** Writing.

**Speaker A:** So this is the point, is that the mind goes very quickly into a dull state this slips and slides away from whatever topic that you're thinking about, and that we have to continuously, on a regular basis, bring it back to the wholesome over and over and over and over again. I've been talking to the students for years about this, and yet most of the students do not develop this habit, or this new habit, of Practice and practice. Sit down and have one wholesome thought after another after another for about 5 minutes or so, and then go about what you were doing. And then when that alarm clock goes off again, maybe 15 minutes later, you will go back and start having wholesome thoughts one after another after another after another, watching and making sure that unwholesome thoughts don't slip back in. And if you develop that kind of practice, you will gain great benefit, great fruit. The Buddha even practices that or talks about it in the Anapanasati Sutta, that practicing Anapanasati is of great fruit, including the training of the mind. The interesting thing about the Anapanasati Sutta is that every item that's on the list, he talks about it as a skill in the sense of thus one trains oneself. We have to train the mind to come out of fear. We have to train the mind to become comfortable. We have to train the mind to become satisfied. Why? Because it's so easy. For it to slip back into dissatisfaction. It's, uh, that's the normal kind of state that the mind is in. But if you practice over and over and over again, many times a day, maybe actually 1 hour a day for 5 minutes, uh, if you practice for 12 hours, guess what? That's, that's an hour. 5 minutes times 12 is an actual hour. Or you can practice 10 minutes for 6 hours a day, but I'm not even sure that you can practice for 10 minutes. In fact, it's probably hard for most to practice for having one wholesome thought after another after another for 5 minutes. The mind will slip and slide away so quickly that we're not even aware of it. And so we need to start dedicating. We can— now the sutras use words that I wouldn't particularly recommend, but the translators chose words like diligent and ardent. I would say that those words have negative connotations in and of themselves. I would use the word enthusiastic. You enthusiastically keep coming back to wholesome thoughts, one after another after another. And so this is what the talk is today, is the mind is going to slip slide away, and your job is to see it slipping and sliding and bring it back to the wholesome over and over and over and over again for about 5 minutes. And then now you're free to go write that article, rob the bank, uh, go do whatever you're going to do. And then when the bell rings, you'll say, oh, I can't finish robbing the bank now, I'm going to set my, my gun down and I'm going to practice wholesome thoughts for 5 minutes. You'll probably just not pick up that gun after you have 5 minutes of wholesome thoughts. But whatever you're doing Stop what you're doing and start having happy, wholesome thoughts over and over and over again for about 5 minutes, and then come back to whatever you were doing before. So if you're eating, can you set that plate down for 5 minutes and have wholesome thoughts? I'm going to be okay. Everything is all right. I'm completely satisfied. In fact, what will happen is, is that if you do that in the middle of a meal, you probably won't even want the rest of the meal because now you're already satisfied. That if you eat slowly, you'll eat less. Normally we gobble food down because we're hungry, and often we'll eat more than we actually need because we're not paying attention to the body. But if you in fact will start paying attention to what the body is doing, paying attention to how you feel, pay attention to that state of mind, and pay attention to those moment-by-moment slip-sliding thoughts that you have and keep bringing them back to the wholesome with thoughts like 'I can do this' over and over again, we're actually building new habits. This is the actual practice that the Buddha gave. He did not have retreats. That's a very funny thing that in the West they think that, oh, I've got to go do a retreat. You don't have to do a retreat. In fact, the Buddha never recommended anything like a retreat. What he recommended was solitude or seclusion. He said go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, sit under a tree or a pile of straw, and then bring— in the translation that is often used— brings mindfulness to the fore, which means start looking at what's happening right now. Think about what you're thinking right now. Look at what you're thinking. And make a change to it. Change those hindrances into happy, wholesome thoughts, and then watch the mind, because those unwholesome thoughts, those hindrances, will slip right back in. And so we have to keep paying close attention. If you can start to pay close attention that will develop the mind so that you can develop the skill of feeling safe and secure and comfortable. You can develop the skill to become satisfied. You can develop the skill of being in a state of can-do. You can come out of that state of, "Oh, this is hard." That's in fact what happens when the students start to practice then the mind will slip away and they'll say, oh, this is so hard, which is just another— in fact, that's the statement that's made from that hindrance. And then we use the word hard, which actually means that we're in a feeling state of not liking. When the meditation is hard, that means then that we're in a state of doubt. We're not sure about how to bring it back into the wholesome. So though, uh, whenever you use the word hard, this is actually a keyword I give you for your mind has slipped away. It slipped away. That's why you're using the word hard, and you can just slip it right back into place. It's not hard to have a happy, wholesome thought. You've had happy, wholesome thoughts your whole life. You meet that new girl and she smiles at you and you feel happy. Well, guess what? Now you can learn to smile at yourself and be happy. You don't need somebody else to smile at you. You can smile on your own. You don't have to do it from the outside world. That's in fact the problem, is that we think that our happiness and joy is going to be coming from getting what we want, as opposed to you're not going to get what you want. What you need to do is to change your want so that you can become satisfied that what I've got is all I want and need. This is the real change, is to change all of that stuff about what you want. You want a motorbike, you want a scooter, you want a job, you want a house. You want to get fed, you want a new shirt. People get, let us say, momentary happiness by going shopping. Oh, I've got something new now. And then they look at their bank statement and they feel bad. But at least for a moment when they're out shopping, they feel good. This is why the word you've heard possibly before called a shopaholic. Because people get their good feelings from shopping, and every one of you has more junk than you need. You just got so much stuff. I mean, look at the couch that you're on, Alex. You can't use all of that couch. You can't do it, right? You got a lot more couch than you need there.

**Speaker C:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's the whole idea, is, is that we can come down to become satisfied with what we've got. But we have to practice that over and over and over and over and over again because we've got that shopper's mentality. We're all shopaholics. We all go and get benefit and feel good because of some new item that we bought. So, hello, Anna. Good to see you. I miss you so much, Dhammarato. So, we've been talking about practice, to come back to practice, to set a timer once an hour to take 5 minutes and practice 12 times a day. Because the mind will slip, slide away. It's the normal state for the mind, partly due to our instincts, partly due to the underlying tendencies in our DNA, but also partly because we have developed habits that we learned from the adults when we were little children, and they operated out of their instincts also. And so the whole world trains all of the children of the world to be unhappy. It's a part of the training. But in fact, it's hard to abuse the resources of another person, and that's what big business does. Big business is abusing each and every one of us so long as we're unhappy. That the newscasters abuse us by making us feel afraid. Newspapers that had only good news don't stay in business very long because the main reason for newspapers is to make people feel unhappy so that they'll come back to get more news that makes them feel again unhappy. Unhappy. So the whole show is stacked against you to slip, slide away back into unwholesome, unhappy thoughts. So that means that we need to practice over and over and over again to have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. This is one's correct practice. We need to do this often throughout the day. Why? Because throughout the day, how many slip-sliding hindrances are you going to have? A thousand? Can we in fact come up to the point that we can actually come to break-even so that half the thoughts we have are happy, wholesome thoughts and half of the thoughts are hindrances? Wow, that's amazing if you can do that. Very, very few people can do that. But it's still half your day is in hindrances and unhappiness. So that means then that we can begin more enthusiastic, become more ardent, more dedicated to start watching every thought that comes by so that we can bring it back to being a happy, wholesome, satisfying thought. The Buddha only taught one thing, and it's in the Pali as Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means if you can see those slip-sliding thoughts, can you see the dissatisfaction, can you see the unwholesome thoughts, can you see the hindrances in the mind? If you can, as soon as you see them, you can slip back into a positive statement and back into the wholesome. You can slip right back into place. And so this is what we have to practice, though, to practice to remember to look at what the mind is doing so that we can bring it back into a wholesome state over and over and over and over again. This is the main teaching, is that we've got to practice And those who do practice some are gaining great benefit. I would think that everyone here has gotten some benefit out of it. And what I'm recommending is that if you keep practicing and practicing and practicing, you'll begin to get great benefit, great fruit out of the practice. But you have to do it over and over and over again. So if you've got a cell phone, set that cell phone to go off once an hour. And when it goes off, your job then for the next 5 minutes is to be happy. Don't worry, be happy. Then in fact, that's some— uh, Bobby McFerrin has a song about that. And that we can say that that's not just Dharma That's all there is to Dhamma, is to see that worry and stop it. To see those unwholesome thoughts and to stop. That when the mind is slip-sliding away, where it goes is it slips back into worry, back into doubt, back into restlessness, back into discomfort, back into dissatisfaction, because we were trained that way. Think about it like this. How many of you were raised by happy people? How many of you were raised, or none of you were raised by happy people? If you were raised by happy people, you wouldn't need to listen to me being happy about the Dharma. Everybody here was raised by unhappy people, and you bought that.

**Speaker B:** Trip.

**Speaker A:** And that's why we're so unhappy so much of the time. And that there is a solution to that problem, but you— that solution means that you've got to counteract. You can't— you got to come back over and over and over and over and over again to practice being wholesome. That's the teaching of the Buddha, to see those unwholesome thoughts and to change them. To see it again and to change it, or to have one happy wholesome thought after another, after another, after another, after another, so that you can sustain it. But be careful, because that 7th thought in a row is now not going to be wholesome. It's going to slip back into the unwholesome again. So can you see that and bring it— oh no, I saw that. Aha, I caught you! That's the statement of the Buddha. Aha, I can see you, Mara. Now, Mara actually is a Pali word that actually there's two words, Maya and Mara, whether you put the R in it or not. It seems very consistent that Sanskrit uses an R for so many words, and in Nepali they don't use the word. With an R. So you have Kamma, Karma, Dhamma, Dharma, Mara, Maya. Okay, so over and over again, this word Maya can be thought of as the devil, and that the devil's on one shoulder and the angel is on the other. You can think of that Maya, or unwholesome thoughts, are there to whisper in your ear over and over and over again. And they're full-blown yakety yakety yakety yakety to where the angel, he's happy and quiet. He doesn't have much to say. So that means then that the human mind is going to be mostly filled with unhappy, unwholesome thoughts said by the devil in you. So Flip Wilson, back in the 1960s, had the phrase, 'The devil made me do it.' Okay, every unwholesome thought that you had, the devil made you do that. Can you see that devil in you? Can you see it? Because if you can see those unwholesome devil thoughts, you can change them. If you are not paying attention, then that devil is going to be yak yak yak yak yak yak nonstop, and you're going to be an unhappy, miserable person. May be depressed, taking depression pills, and not having a good life. And all we need to do is to start jacking up that, uh, um, uh, angel and, uh, tell the devil thoughts to shut up. Now, this is not magic. This angel thought and devil thought is just a thought that you have. There's no real devil. That it's actually just unwholesome thoughts that you have. And so I would highly recommend to start paying attention to what's in the mind. Are you going to be slip-sliding back into the double thoughts, or are you going to come back into those happy, wholesome thoughts one after another after another after another? And then the mind slips away. Never mind, start again. And come back to happy, wholesome thoughts. Easy enough, huh? Not hard. Easy when you practice. When you're enthusiastic for the practice, it becomes easy. Your life becomes really easy. There's nothing hard there. All the hard that you ever had was stuff you made up. You made that shit up. Your life is hard because you made it hard, and your life can be easy if you keep practicing coming out of the hard and coming back to the easy. So Christina, what do you.

**Speaker D:** Think? I'm, I'm curious if.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker D:** Um If the start is right view or if it's perception or like where does it start? Where do you catch it? If it's perception or effort?

**Speaker A:** So in this situation that we're talking about today, it starts with that cell phone ringing. That's where it starts. And that cell phone ringing means that the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to happily turn that phone ringing off. Okay, I guess it would make— go back to sleep. You're telling the phone to go back to sleep. The second thing you can do then, immediately after that, is tell the devil to go to sleep. Remember to start having happy thoughts. You can then tell those angel thoughts, the happy thoughts, wake up, wake up, come back. Okay, so the Buddha talks about it in the sense of right view is to remember to look to see who in your head is talking. And if it's the devil, tell him to shut.

**Speaker C:** Up.

**Speaker A:** Be quiet. I don't need that. I'm a happy dude now. You can't make me be feeling bad. So that's how it starts. It starts by remembering to look and to keep looking and keep looking. Every thought needs to be be part of the investigation. But nobody can do that in the beginning. You don't have the skill to keep looking at every thought. You can start doing it once an hour to start looking. But in fact, some people in meditation, they talk about counting breath, and we can count how long we can hold our breath, or we can count how many breaths that we can take, etc., like that, without forgetting. And I give you a new one now. How many wholesome thoughts can you have in a row? Start counting your wholesome thoughts. Everything is okay. 1. Wow, what a good day this is. 2. Everything is all right. 3. Not a problem in the world. 4. Oh, I feel so good.

**Speaker C:** 5.

**Speaker A:** I don't like this. All right, so I got 5 in a row. Never mind, start again. Let's keep coming back over and over again. So never mind, start again. That's the first wholesome thought. Aha, I saw that thought about this is hard and I don't like it. That's another wholesome thought. But when we're not paying attention, when the mind slips and slides away back into those devil thoughts, back into the Mara, your job is to say, "I see that. I see those unwholesome thoughts," and then start back practicing again. So if you practice that 5 minutes once an hour, guess what? During the 55 minutes between, you will begin to start filling in the gaps. That in fact you could say, well, wait a minute, if I have 5 minutes of wholesome thoughts followed by 55 minutes of hindrances and unwholesome thoughts, how am I ever going to get anywhere? That's even worse when we think of, oh, you're supposed to practice for an hour, you got to practice meditation for an hour, Well, during that hour, most people are not going to be practicing for the full hour. They're going to be dull. They're going to be full of hindrances because they're not really practicing. They think that they're noting their thoughts, but they're not actually changing them to happy, wholesome thoughts. But if they could spend 1 hour in happy, wholesome thoughts, that would be a miracle. If they could do it. But they don't, because an hour is too much for the mind. It wanders away too quickly. And so I would recommend doing 5 minutes. Can you in fact spend 5 minutes in wholesome thought? I bet you can't do it. Never mind, start again. So, Mr. Ben, what do you think? Can you practice over and over.

**Speaker B:** Again? Very satisfied with the talk. Perfectly good enough.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Do it. How about you, Okie Dokie? Can you practice Okie Dokie thoughts? One happy Yes, I can. Good Samaritan for practice. Yes, we need to practice. That's what this is about. That's why we call this Slip Sliding Away Talk, is because the mind is going to slip slide away. Even in 5 minutes, you can't do.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker A:** Yes, sounds good. And pretty soon you can in fact do 5 minutes of happy, wholesome thoughts. You can in fact start to develop that skill, to develop the habit of having happy thoughts. So, Nibbana, what do you.

**Speaker C:** Think? I think it's great. I think it's great, Dhammarato. That's exactly what I'm looking for. Of realizing how much I slip, slide away all day long, even though this is what I'm kind of setting myself to do. That's my only job. I quit my job a few months ago, so I have no other job than raising my kids and having happy thoughts. So I'm going to do the 5 minutes every hour, starting as soon as we're done.

**Speaker A:** I'm going for it. Start right now.

**Speaker B:** Ding!

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Right now. Well, it's hard to have bad thoughts when you're talking, Dhammarato, but after you're gone, they all start back.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** The mind will slip slide away. So let's watch it. Let's take care of it. So how about you, Justin? What do you think?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, this was great. Thank you. I think the reminder about enthusiasm versus like a diligence or discipline was really helpful, just because I can find myself saying to myself, like, oh, I'm not being disciplined enough or diligent enough in this aspect. But that's already an unwholesome thought right there. So instead, bringing it more into that enthusiasm for the practice, that's a very good reminder.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Delight.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy it, Alex.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was saying to delight, to have enthusiasm is to delight in it, to joy. To rejoice. It's a verb. It's something we do. So when we practice that skill again and again and again, we become pretty good at looking at all of this crap with a composed mind because we're delighting in it. We're not worried about it anymore. So delight is a really good way to talk about that, Piti. Delight, success, enjoyment.

**Speaker A:** Joy. So, Arahant, what do you think? It's good to see you again. Been a while. Same. Sorry. Friend is sleeping. Don't want to wake them up. Wakey.

**Speaker C:** Wakey.

**Speaker A:** The alarm goes off. Ding ding ding ding. Time to be happy. Indeed. Notice how many ladies we've got today. We've got Rose and Okie Dokie and Grantha and Christina and Anna. Wow. Is that all?

**Speaker C:** That's great. Awesome.

**Speaker A:** Awesome. Glad that you're here. Okay, Rose, what do you think? You got something to say? No, I think that's really good. Thank you. Just keep going. All right. Amar, what about you? What do you have to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker F:** Um, I think it's great. I feel, I feel great right now.

**Speaker A:** So that's it right now. Excellent, excellent. Don't worry, be happy. Everything is okay. Let's come out of those unwholesome, unhappy thoughts that we keep slipping into. So does anybody have any final things to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker A:** All right, so Mikey, why don't you take it away?

**Speaker C:** Hey!

**Speaker B:** He has been kidnapped.

**Speaker A:** Can you take it away?

**Speaker C:** Having happy thoughts, he's forgetting everything. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Mikey. Naved, I gave you a homework assignment in the.

**Speaker A:** Chat. Okay.

**Speaker C:** Oh, cool. I'll check.

**Speaker D:** It. It's to come up with a Dhammarato ringtone for all of our collective.

**Speaker A:** Phones. Yeah, somebody can come up with a ringtone that we could have, something like a clip out of, uh, Don't Worry Be Happy, you know, the part. Mikey, are you back.

**Speaker F:** Yet?

**Speaker B:** Maybe Wakey Wakey mixed with Alex's.

**Speaker F:** Laughter. All right, well, thank you, friends, for being here today. If you guys are watching this on YouTube, welcome to come join us in the Dharma Friends Discord.

### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and advice from Dhammarato:

### **Core Topic: "Slip Sliding Away"**
The mind's natural tendency is to slip and slide away from wholesome, focused thoughts into unwholesome, distracted, or negative states. This is the fundamental challenge in practice.

### **Main Points & Instructions:**

1.  **Acknowledging the Problem:** The untrained mind is constantly slipping away, whether from meditation, studying, or daily tasks. We often read or do things mechanically while the mind is elsewhere.
2.  **You *Can* Control Your Mind:** The claim of having "no control" is false. We demonstrate control in daily life (e.g., driving safely, waiting patiently, stopping a child from crying). This same capacity can be applied to Dharma practice.
3.  **The Core Practice: Catch & Return**
    *   **Observe:** The first skill is to see the mind *beginning* to slip, not just noticing after it's gone.
    *   **Return:** Gently and **enthusiastically** bring it back to a wholesome, happy thought (e.g., "Don't worry, be happy," "Everything is okay").
    *   **Repeat:** Do this over and over. The goal is to string together several wholesome thoughts in a row, knowing the mind will slip again. "Never mind, start again."
4.  **Practical Method: The Timer Technique**
    *   Use your phone's alarm to ring **once every hour**.
    *   When it rings, pause whatever you're doing for **5 minutes**.
    *   Dedicate those 5 minutes solely to generating and sustaining happy, wholesome thoughts. This is your formal practice session.
    *   This frequent, short practice is more effective and realistic than struggling with long, infrequent sessions where the mind wanders uncontrollably.
5.  **Reframing "Hard" Practice:** Saying meditation is "hard" is itself a sign the mind has slipped into a hindrance (aversion, doubt). It's not inherently hard; the difficulty comes from resisting the simple act of returning to a happy thought. Replace "diligent/ardent" with **"enthusiastic."**
6.  **Underlying Mind States:** Beneath the momentary thoughts is a general **attitude or state of mind** (e.g., sharp, dull, "poor me," satisfied). The practice aims to cultivate and stabilize a wholesome underlying state like satisfaction, safety, and a "can-do" attitude.
7.  **Cultural Context & Modern Application:** Traditionally, monks might have used the burning of a joss stick (~20 mins) as a timer. Modern retreats promoting hour-long sits are often unrealistic for beginners. The Buddha emphasized frequent practice in **seclusion** (like under a tree), not necessarily long retreats.
8.  **The "Devil" and the "Angel":** Framed as a metaphor: the "devil" (Mara) represents the stream of unwholesome, negative self-talk we're conditioned with. The "angel" is the quiet, wholesome voice. Practice is about spotting the devil's chatter and telling it to "shut up," thereby strengthening the angel.
9.  **Societal Conditioning:** We are raised by and live in a society that often conditions us to be unhappy (via news, consumerism, etc.) to be more controllable. Dharma practice is the **counter-training** to this deep-seated habit.
10. **Right View in Action:** Right view here means **remembering to look** at what's in your mind. Investigate each thought. Is it the "devil" or the "angel"? Seeing it clearly provides the opportunity to change it.

### **Key Takeaways:**
*   The mind's slippage is normal; don't condemn yourself for it.
*   Practice in **short, frequent, and enthusiastic bursts**.
*   Use a **timer** as your support system.
*   The essence of practice is the **joyful redirection** of the mind from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts, countless times a day.
*   This repeated action builds new habits, changes your underlying mental state, and leads to great benefit and fruit from the Dharma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (Dhammarato) to illustrate the practice of mindfulness and mind-training:

### **1. Primary Metaphor: “Slip Sliding Away”**
- **Source:** Paul Simon’s song *“Slip Sliding Away.”*
- **Meaning:** The mind’s tendency to wander away from wholesome thoughts or focus, especially during practice. It captures the slippery, elusive nature of attention.

### **2. Metaphor: Driving a Car**
- **Usage:** To counter the belief that “I have no control over my mind.”
- **Meaning:** Just as we can control a car well enough to drive safely, we already have some innate ability to direct attention—we just need to apply it to meditation.

### **3. Story: Reading Without Comprehension**
- **Scenario:** Reading to the bottom of a page and realizing the eyes saw words but the mind was elsewhere.
- **Meaning:** Illustrates how the mind habitually “slips away” even during simple tasks, showing automatic pilot vs. mindful presence.

### **4. Story: Waiting Room Impatience**
- **Scenario:** Waiting impatiently at a bus station or doctor’s office, wanting things to happen immediately, yet restraining ourselves from barging in.
- **Meaning:** Demonstrates we *do* have self-control in everyday life—we can choose patience over agitation, which is a form of mental training.

### **5. Metaphor: Devil and Angel on Shoulders**
- **Reference:** Common cultural image; linked to Flip Wilson’s comedy line *“The devil made me do it.”*
- **Meaning:** “Devil” represents unwholesome thoughts (Mara); “angel” represents wholesome thoughts. The mind is often dominated by the “devil’s” chatter unless we consciously choose the “angel’s” perspective.

### **6. Historical/Cultural Anecdote: Incense Sticks as Timers**
- **Story:** In ancient times, monks used burning incense sticks (lasting ~20 minutes) as meditation timers. When the smoke stopped, mosquitoes returned, reminding them to mindfully light another.
- **Meaning:** Simple, environmental cues can support practice; today we can use cell phone alarms similarly.

### **7. Story: The Lotus Eaters**
- **Reference:** From Homer’s *Odyssey*—Odysseus encounters lotus-eaters who live in a drugged, careless state.
- **Meaning:** Lotus buds given to Thai monks are slightly hallucinogenic; most monks avoid them. The story hints at how easy it is to seek intoxication (literal or mental) rather than clarity.

### **8. Metaphor: Writer’s Block**
- **Scenario:** A writer stuck and frustrated; the solution is to set the work aside, restore a wholesome mind state, then return.
- **Meaning:** When stuck in a hindrance (like frustration), the skillful response is to pause, reset the mind to wholesome, and resume—not to force through unwholesome states.

### **9. Metaphor: Shopaholic Mentality**
- **Meaning:** People seek happiness from external acquisitions (shopping), which gives fleeting joy but often leads to dissatisfaction (e.g., checking the bank account). We are all “shopaholics” for external validation unless we train internal contentment.

### **10. Metaphor: News Media Conditioning**
- **Meaning:** News outlets thrive on making people unhappy or afraid so they return for more. Similarly, society conditions us into dissatisfaction—practice is counter-conditioning.

### **11. Practical Metaphor: Counting Wholesome Thoughts**
- **Exercise:** Like counting breaths, count consecutive wholesome thoughts (e.g., “Everything is okay—1”).
- **Meaning:** Builds awareness of how quickly the mind slips back to unwholesome patterns; “Never mind, start again” becomes the practice.

### **12. Metaphor: The Alarm Clock as a “Bell of Mindfulness”**
- **Modern application:** Setting a phone alarm hourly to pause and practice 5 minutes of wholesome thoughts.
- **Meaning:** Uses technology as a support for continuous retraining, replacing ancient reminders like incense sticks.

---

### **Core Teaching Illustrated Through Metaphors:**
The mind is like a **slippery fish**—it naturally slides toward unwholesome, habitual patterns. Practice is the **net of awareness**—catching it early, gently returning it to wholesome thoughts, and doing this repeatedly until new habits form. The **goal** is not to never slip, but to notice slipping faster and correct course with enthusiasm.
