### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello friends, it's Saturday morning Thai time and Friday evening in the US. Uh, it's, let me see, February the, uh, 14th, halfway through. In fact, is today Valentine's Day? That's an interesting thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So Today we shall talk about basic practice. It's always good to go back and repeat it because we oftentimes get off into some strange territory based upon questions people ask. But I would like to start today's talk with the idea that the Buddhist teaching is for immediate benefit. It's an immediate path. As soon as you start practicing, you get immediate benefits. However, there is a gradual path, and this gradual path seems to have kind of taken over. Now, the gradual path, you could go so far as to say that all of society is on a gradual path. You go to school, go to high school, get a degree, get a house, get a wife, get a car, get into debt, and it takes years and years and years to get all of that done, and you're still not satisfied. That's the hallmark of the gradual path, is that almost no one has ever been successful in taking, staying on a gradual path and actually getting something. That perhaps we could go so far as to say that the gradual path is really not getting much of anywhere. Another way of looking at it, it's like the major pharmaceutical companies throughout the world are much, much more interested in finding medicines that cure symptoms of a disease rather than curing the disease itself. And the Noble Path, the immediate path of the Dharma, actually is a cure for the spiritual disease, to where the gradual path just merely works with symptoms. Now, not only is all of society kind of on a gradual path, most specifically All of the religions are on a gradual path, kind of waiting and hoping for some giant agent in the sky, some Kamma machine, some God or some something to come in, intervene, and do your job for you so that you don't have to do it yourself. And that waiting time then, is the gradual part of the path. Christians are looking for a gradual path in the sense of, let us say, doing whatever they need to do to please Jesus or God so that God will help them be friends with them, give them what they want. And so much of prayer is basically a formalized way of talking about the things that you don't have that you want. And wanting things that you don't have is actually Dukkha. And so the gradual path then is perpetual in its Dukkha, it doesn't have actually any cure. That in fact, if you did manage to get what you wanted, then the want doesn't go away for long. We've already gotten the habit of wanting, and so we'll want this. Maybe we don't get it, or we do get it, and then we'll want something else, and then we'll want something else. This is part of the gradual path, and you can think of it as, let us say, spotty wish fulfillment. But the noble path is actually the path that has the cure. Hello, Gigi, your microphone is on.

**Speaker C:** Arya, good to see you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we've just been starting to talk about the gradual path, and everyone is on a gradual path. The religions are on a gradual path, and that much of the Buddhist teaching is also on a gradual path. In fact, that which makes Buddhism, a religion, is what defines it as being on a gradual path, as opposed to the Noble Path is an immediate path. And so the gradual path that you find brings in all kinds of things that the Buddha did not talk about, and that we can say, well, The things that the Buddha didn't talk about wound up in the suttas anyway. Yes, that's because the suttas has been messed with over a long period of time in order to support people's old belief systems rather than them dropping their old belief systems and take on the new practice of the Noble Path. Vipassana meditation is a really good example of a gradual path, and that the gradual path is hallmarked by, "Oh, I see a problem today, and that means that I have work to do tomorrow or later." That's it. And I think that every one of you have had those kind of thoughts in the sense of, I see the problem, but I'm going to put off fixing it. One of my favorite stories is that Tathagata, before he became a monk, made a phone call to a very famous teacher in England, and she discussed it in the sense that She can see that she still has defilements, and so therefore she wants to take yet another meditation retreat so that she can go deep, hoping that going deep into meditation is going to solve her defilements. And the point is, if she were on the Noble Path, if she sees the defilements right here, right now, she can fix those defilements right here, right now. That's the way to practice. And this idea from Vipassana of going deep into meditation has kind of got a Catch-22, or let us say an issue or a problem with how they think about it. Because they look at Jhana, which they consider deep states of meditation, and yet the Vipassana practice does not practice Jhana, it practices insight. And then when the insight doesn't work, now they want to go deep into meditation using the same tools and techniques that they used for the Vipassana. And very few get anything out of it. Teachers get, let us say, trained into being passive. But the real hallmark of the Noble Path is that it's joyful. And that joy has to be cultivated and is cultivated right here, right now, rather than postponing what needs to be done. And I've heard students— in fact, Nick was here just the other day— saying he has much work to do. Now, that phrase right there indicates that he still thinks that he's on a gradual path. The reality is, is that there is not much work to do. We only have right here, right now. Let's do what needs to be done right here, right now, rather than postponing it, calling it work. Uh, there are many other expressions for that, and so I would like to caution each one of you as we start into this video about postponing the practice. Now, a lot of reasons why people would want to postpone the practice is because they have been trained, oh, I have to go to a retreat to practice. And these retreats can get really expensive, a couple thousand dollars or more. Also The reason that people put it off is because they think that either they need a retreat or they need a special place. I've heard people talk about, oh, I've got a little shrine in my bedroom that's got candles and incense and an altar and a cushion, and that's where I go to meditate. Which means that the whole show then, they're talking about being on a gradual path to where the actual teaching of the Buddha is immediate, which means wherever you are, in whatever posture you're in, whatever company that you're in, right then and there is the time to practice. Why? Because if you practice right here, right now, you'll get the benefits of correct practice that you're practicing right here, right now, as opposed to putting it off. Now, if you put it off, how long can you put it off? That's what makes it a gradual path, is because you can put it off and put it off and put it off indefinitely.

**Speaker B:** I do that sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Ivan, what'd you say?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I said like sometimes, like sometimes I switch to the ordinary view and then like, you know, I don't know how they happen, it sneaks in and then it's like, it's gonna take a while. And then once I had that view and the next thing I know I'm putting it off, you know, I said I will relax later. You know, like, let me have what I want first, then I'll practice later. You know, that kind of weird thing. And I keep putting it off. I find that funny sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly what happens is that we put it off because we think that it's a big deal and that we have a lot of work to do. And that mentality is the ordinary mentality that probably every one of you was raised on. You come home saying, oh, I've got homework to do. Do you just do the homework, or do you put it off?

**Speaker B:** I put it off.

**Speaker A:** How about study? Do we put study off until it's immediate? You've got an exam coming up and that's when you study. How about instead of studying for an exam that you pay attention in class? If you're paying attention in class and you're learning immediately, right then and there,, as opposed to putting it off. So, this is the way that we're going to start talking about the Noble Practice, is that we practice it and do it immediately. There is a phrase that talks about that it's immediate, that it is timeless in the sense that we don't put it off into the future, Come and see for yourself. Savako Bhagavadamo sanditiko ekaliko ehipassana. This means this is the actual teaching of the Buddha to come do it right now and gain the benefits of doing it right now. And the more we practice, the more we do this, coming out of our old habits, then the better it feels. Like, oh, what a relief it is! I don't have to think about all of those made-up worries and stories. I can just stop doing that. To where the ordinary mind will make up stories and things to do and then say, oh, but I've got to go now, take care of that later. Rather than merely throwing it out right now. Those are unwholesome thoughts. And the teaching of the Buddha from the Eightfold Noble Path talks about three aspects, and that number one is to remember to look at what's happening in the mind. And then the third one is to change. The Buddha's model is a change model, and the way that we change is immediately, right here, right now. Now you can see that because of the old habits of the mind, we can make a change right here, right now, and then find very quickly that we have reverted back to the old way of thinking. But in fact, each one of you probably has had the experience of having a good wholesome thought, something like, wow, this is good, I feel joy. And then the next thought will be, it's not enough joy. Or they'll have the thought, wow, I can be satisfied. And then the next thought would be, "Yes, but it's not enough satisfaction. I have to go deep." And so you can see then, this path that is immediate will almost always spring us back to the old path of the gradual path because that's familiar territory. We know that one. But if we continue to practice over and over and over again, this remembering to come into the present moment. That's what the word Sati means. Now, I know in Western Buddhism, which is a gradual path, they use the word mindfulness, but that's not the definition of Sati. The definition of the word Sati is to remember to come back to this present moment, to come be here now. And when you're in the here-now, now you can look at what the mind is doing in this thought right here, right now. This can be done on the tram, on the subway. It can be done while you're in class. It can be done anywhere at any time. For that reason, we generally don't use the word meditation. Meditation, you could say, is a word that Western Buddhism has put onto the practice, where the history of the word meditation is that we're meditating or cogitating or thinking about a particular subject. An example of that would be in the old days, Christian monks would contemplate the features of the compassion of Mary, or they would contemplate what is the Trinity, and they would get all confused about what kind of thoughts they were having, etc., like that. This is not that kind of practice. And so what we're doing here, which we call Anapanasati, is actually not a meditation. Look at the differences. Meditation is done at a particular place, probably at a particular time with particular features and events, where Anapanasati can be done any place, any time, that you remember to practice. Now, it actually would seem then that if you had a particular place that you went to, it would be easy enough to remember to practice when you get there because you've got all of these anchors about going into the room and sitting down and all that kind of stuff. However, the likelihood is, is that when someone is sitting in a formal meditation practice, more than likely the mind is not focusing on this present moment. Rather, the mind is in an ordinary state, roaming and roaming around in the past, ruminating, thinking about things. Or the other possibility is to become One-pointed or focused, for an example, would be focusing closely on the nostrils of the nose, or on a casino, which would be like a pad of mud that you just look at it and look at it and look at it. These are one-pointed concentration methods that predated the Buddha and are part of the gradual path, that the actual path of the Buddha is that we come out of unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts to get the mind fixed right here, right now, to throw out the spiritual disease, that we don't have to go deep because the unwholesome thoughts, if you want to call them defilements, that's a really heavy-duty word. That word is not in the, um, in, in the suttas. But, um, we can think of defilements are going very deep, and so we have to go really, really deep into meditation in order to find them. Now, that's not the case. Imagine that a tree Now, we've been told, some of us have been told all of our lives that the roots of a tree go deep, 30, 40, 50 meters. In fact, that the roots will go as deep as the tree is tall. If that were true, then it would be very difficult or impossible to transplant trees. And yet they're doing that in landscaping on a regular basis. They'll take a big scooper and scoop up the tree and its roots. That in fact, the quality of the roots of a tree is that they spread out. That's what gives the tree stability in its root system, is that the tree roots are spread out and that the tree roots go only as deep as they find nourishment. Deep in the ground, You're not going to find any nourishment down there. It's only clay or sand or rock. But on the surface, you'll find all kinds of things that the tree roots can use for nourishment. This is a good example for how to actual practice, is to stay in the here-now, stay actually fairly close to the surface and see what's going on in the mind at that surface level. That we don't have to go deep in order to get rid of the defilements. The defilements are coming up. All we have to do is remember to look at them, to see them, and then to do something about it right then and there. As opposed to the gradual path of seeing the defilements and saying, oh, I've got work to do, or oh, I've got to go deep into meditation, or put something off into the future. That's one of the most important qualities of the gradual path, is that it's in the future. I also see people even on our Discord group who talk about enlightenment is some goal that has been set off into the future. The point is, is that if you're not heavy right now, if you're actually looking, turning your own internal lights on, the enlightenment is right here, right now. Can you turn the lights on? Can you see what the mind is doing? And by seeing what the mind is doing, turning the lights on, you can see that you're carrying some pretty heavy-duty stuff. Why don't we set that down? Lighten the load. And so this is actually a twin definition of the word enlightenment, and it's got roots in various suttas, including the Great Forty, which is the exposition on the Eightfold Noble Path, as well as in the Anapanasati Sutta and many other places, the Buddha talks about the path being a two-step combination. The two steps are knowledge or looking or seeing or turning the lights on. And once you turn the lights on and see what you're doing, you can drop it right then and there. Those are the two forms of enlightenment. And that second quality of enlightenment, to set things down, is the actual deliverance. But we cannot be delivered from our heavy thoughts without seeing them first. And so the way to practice is to remember to look and then to change, to see those unwholesome thoughts. Now, in fact, in the suttas we have several different ways of looking at them. One is to refer to them as hindrances. And what the word hindrance means is that these items of the mind are hindering each individual one from being in a really good, happy state. They're also called obstacles, which is exactly the same thing as hindrances. And that the quality of the path is that we begin to gain the perspective or the idea that no matter how much the mind is obstructed we can change it. By looking and seeing that the mind is dirty, we can clean it right then and there. Possibly an example of that is that you're driving around and the car has gotten dirty from driving around, and then we'll have the thought, "Oh, I've got to take it to the car wash." But we don't take it to the car wash, we keep riding it in the mud, It gets dirtier and we'll have the thought again, oh, I've got to take it to the car wash. This is the gradual path. You don't have to wait to take the mind to its own mental car wash. You can wash it out right then and there to remove these hindrances, to remove these obstacles. Another word that's used is unwholesome thoughts. Thoughts of danger, thoughts of non-safety, thoughts of discomfort, thoughts of wanting something that we don't have, thoughts of wanting to do something in the future in order to make ourselves feel good, when in fact we can do things right now to feel good. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about in a little book, in fact it was a talk that he gave, this labeled as Hunger and Happiness. And hunger and happiness generally means that when we are hungry, we go do something to alleviate that hunger. For instance, we're thirsty for knowledge, and so we go and read a book to gain that knowledge. In order to not feel hungry. Or if we're hungry for comfort, we're hungry for sex, we're hungry for food, we're hungry for all kinds of things. And when we then go and try to find something that eliminates that hunger, then we'll feel good for a short time, and then some new hunger is going to show up. That the correct way of practicing is to see that hunger and then change it in the mind right then and there. Oh, I can do without that. I'm happy right now anyway. And so we change that hunger pattern of hunger, fulfillment, hunger, fulfillment, hunger, fulfillment into hunger, changes into satisfaction, and now we don't have hunger. If the hunger comes back, then we change it back into a state of satisfaction. If the mind is in a state of unhappiness, displeasure, hatred, anger, any of those things, we think that, oh, If I go hurt the person or organization or political party that I'm angry at, I'll feel better. No, anger just promotes more anger. It's a habit that we get into, and we find all kinds of things to be angry at, so that we can go fix it, feel better, and then come back into anger again. Over and over again. But with our practice here of seeing that anger and hatred is just a mental state that we have cultivated, and that we can uncultivate it by changing that hatred into everything is already okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world, and then we can get immediate relief from that anger. Take a few deep breaths, and within 10 or 15 seconds, that anger is gone. As opposed to finding one new thing after another, after another, to be angry at. That's the gradual path. But the immediate path is to be free from it right now. So the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha actually fits in with the Four Noble Truths. He taught it in a way that says both formerly and now, I only teach one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now, the people on the gradual path will say, oh, Dukkha, I have to look at the Dukkha, I have to examine the Dukkha, I have to know it in great detail, and then maybe it won't be so strong anymore. But the immediate path is, aha, I see you, Dukkha, and out you go right here, right now, to be free from it immediately. And you can see that they actually teach it that way in Vipassana, or better still, in the Mahayana noting system, which uses the word Vipassana, is that you note the Dukkha, note it again, Note it again and again and again and see it, see it clearly. Well, while you're looking and seeing it clearly, aren't you also under it? The better thing to do is to see it immediately, in fact see it coming, and then get out of its way. Don't step in it. Stay away from it. That way we don't have to experience the Dukkha. We can see it immediately. So this is the path that the Buddha teaches, is that we can see the Dukkha as Dukkha. We see it and discriminate. Now there's a lot of people on a gradual path that talk about choiceless awareness. What is choiceless awareness? That means to be aware of what's going on but don't make any choices about it. Well, if you're not making any choices about it, then you're going to continue to suffer. Isn't that correct? The Buddha's model, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's model, is a change model, to take the right noble effort to change. And so one of my little stories is we're walking down the sidewalk, and right in front of us as we're approaching, there's a pile of dog doodle. Right on the path. Those that are on the path of choiceless awareness are going to step right in it. They're not making any choices. The other side is the Mahasi method. They're going to grab that pile of Dukkha, take it into the kitchen, slice it, dice it, powder it, blend it, fry it, and eat it. But what's the right way to do? What's the actual Eightfold Noble Path? If you see it in front of you, step around it. Step aside immediately. Don't deal with the Dukkha. Now, I know that many people say, well, if you're going to talk about meditation, why don't you talk about all the formalities that people have, and the answer to that is that those formalities are part of the gradual path. And if you have all of those formalities that you have to accomplish before you can actually practice, then isn't that putting it off? Why don't we see it right then immediately and do something about it? Whatever posture would end wherever we are, wherever we go, An opportunity to practice is right there in front of you. Now, the Buddha recommended go to the forest, go to a foot of a tree, go to an empty hut or a pile of straw, and sit down and start looking at what the mind is doing. The reason that he would recommend that is because if you're in a village with a lot of other ordinary people on an ordinary gradual path, they will try to keep you on their gradual path. So it's better to go into seclusion. But that seclusion doesn't have to be a great big deal seclusion. In fact, you can just shut the door of your bedroom. If you're in an office, you You can just close your eyes sitting in your own cubicle. You don't have to make this seclusion a big deal. Seclusion can be found anywhere. But the important point is, is that we want to get away from as much other people's Dukkha as we can in this moment so that we can deal with only the stuff that's going on with one's own mind. And as we practice, we see by remembering to look, and by remembering to look and to see, we then have an opportunity to see what needs to be changed right then and there. This is the Eightfold Noble Path, the first three items of the path. And then Once we make that change over and over and over again, we begin to change not just the thoughts that we're having, we also begin to change our attitude from being a victim to Dukkha to being a champion of Dukkha. Aha, I see you! We can become joyful even when we see unwholesome thoughts because we're no longer under their thumb. Now we're the champion, and so we can begin to congratulate ourselves. Now, uh, there is actually two different paths. There is the ordinary path, and then there's the Eightfold Noble Path. And one of the qualities of the ordinary path is that they say, oh well, you've got to follow the rules, the Sila, the morality. If you're not a moral person, you can't make any progress in the practice of meditation. The answer is that the mind is the forerunner. If you don't have any unwholesome thoughts, then your morality is going to be pretty good. So we change the thing around from Sila, Samadhi, Pañña which is the ordinary path, which is based upon the gradual changing our behavior, the gradual guarding the eye door or restraining our senses, hoping that that's going to do it. The real restraint needs to come not from restraining the eyes and the ears, but restraining the mind. Anagami door. That's where the real progress will happen. That's where the real Noble Path comes into play. So long as we're guarding the eyes and the ears, so long as we're making sure that we're doing the right thing, that's still just the gradual path, the ordinary path. But if we make this change of attitude, this change of mind, is that I can change my mind right here right now and get the immediate benefit of that right here, right now. By changing the mind over and over and over again this way, we begin to change that attitude into becoming kind of a winner's attitude. You're no longer under the realm of, or being the bottom dog, or being a victim. Circumstances. You're no longer a victim to your own mind. You're no longer a victim at all. Your attitude now is the attitude that you're on top of things. You're an emperor of your own pile of dirt. Now, everybody's an emperor of their own pile of dirt. The problem is, is that most people are buried under their own pile of dirt. But the gradual path is not just being buried, it's struggling to come up to the top. And so we're fighting and struggling and trying to find the top of it. But the noble path is to merely pop right up, to be on top of the world, to be on top of your own pile of dirt, be a real emperor in the sense of being in charge of one's own life. But this takes practice over and over and over again. And so I would recommend that you practice 4, 5, 6, 7 times a day. You know, many of them, the Goenka and the Mahasi and others, they say, oh, you should practice 1 hour a day. Well, if you practice 1 hour a day and only practice 1 hour a day, doesn't that leave you 23 hours of defilements, 23 hours of unwholesome thoughts? Plus the fact that you have been in those unwholesome thoughts for all of these years, kind of looks like this gradual path is going to get you not far. But we can practice the Noble Path regularly throughout the day, 4, 5, 6, 7 times. In fact, we can take that hour and divide it into 5 minutes each. So 12 times a day for 5 minutes, you can be on top of the world. You can throw out all of those unwholesome thoughts about being buried under all your problems and be an emperor, be the boss, be a champion for 5 minutes once an hour. And then it begins to merge together. In the middle of the hour, you begin to recollect, oh, you're all right. So that at most any time you can remember that you're already okay. You're already the boss of your life. But this needs to be practiced over and over again, and it needs to be remembered and practiced especially at that time when you say something like 'Oh, someday I'll be enlightened,' instead of saying, 'Right now, it's good enough, let's do it right now.' Or some will say, 'Oh, I have work to do.' Well, let's do that work. In fact, let's not see it as work, let's see it as a joyful play, and we can come out of it right then and there happily. So this is the difference between the gradual path And the Noble Path is the Noble Path. We put it into effect right away. We remember over and over again. And so the Buddha talks about this. This can be done very quickly. This is not a long, long ordeal. There have been— in fact, I can see right here on this group, there are several people who have gotten this and it has changed their life completely. And it didn't take 7 years. I haven't known any of you guys for 7 years, 2 or 3 at the most, and your whole life has been transformed in that particular time. And it could happen even faster than that if you were paying closer attention, remembering more often. So this is the way of practice over and over and over again. To remember to come out of your crap. Remember to cure yourself from what ails you right now, to take the cure. You'll get sick again. In fact, I have heard that the common cold, there's more than 100 varieties. And so you can catch a cold or the flu every year, or maybe 2 or 3 times, and then you get over it. You get cured from the cold, and then you'll catch it again. Well, the mind is like that. It's better, though, to be cured of your disease, and then if you catch it again, cure yourself very quickly again. Cure yourself quickly again, over and over again. This is the way that we practice so that we can be happy Just remembering that we can do this. So, J.K., what do you think? You're one of the new kids on the block. This is the basic practice of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** What do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I like it. What you were saying about the two definitions of enlightened, of like turning the lights on and then lightening the load. I think that mental, that one moment kind of carried through your whole talk. And so thank you so much. I have a lot to practice and lots of time to do it.

**Speaker A:** No, I just caught you. I just caught you. Did you hear yourself?

**Speaker D:** Already?

**Speaker A:** Oh man, I messed up already. Now that's the second time. No, you didn't mess up already, but you did say, I have a lot of practice I have to do. That's the ordinary path. That's the gradual path, rather than, aha, I can do it right now. This is a change of mind. Remember to keep changing your mind into, we do it right now.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I like that. I like that immediacy. And then just building the confidence now, right? Like getting those reps in. To show that it's not that hard.

**Speaker A:** Just get it done.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Gigi, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** I think you're absolutely right. And my challenge is to apply that with people when I get triggered about something that's an old pattern of mine. The other thing that I think about, though, is— and I think about this all the time, so I'll be bringing it up all the time, like I already do— which is the way that we mistake the teachings, the way that we take the teachings and think that we're doing the right thing, and then It does take a long time because we know it doesn't.

**Speaker A:** It's right now. You do it right now. Right now. You don't think about the future. You don't know what the future is going to be. Say, I can feel good right now. Let the future take care of itself. And then in some future now, you could do that again. But if you have— Yes. 'Now I've got this future.' You're going to keep that future. You're going to stay on the gradual path. The immediate path is to fix it now and then keep fixing it now, to change your orientation from past-future, which is the gradual way, into only you have now. There is no other time. You cannot drink a coffee yesterday. You cannot have a clean mind tomorrow. You can only take a sip of coffee now. But we have been trained through our gradual culture to think of past and future. That I've gotta do it later rather than I can do it right now. Let the— let the future take care of itself. I can do this now.

**Speaker C:** I agree with you. I do agree with you. It's the word again, the discernment to know that this right now thing to do. I think it took me a while to get to that point. And the example that I usually give you is I thought that the right thing to do, the wholesome thing to do, is to be always unconditionally sweet, kind, giving. And I turned out to be completely wrong.

**Speaker A:** That's the gradual path.

**Speaker C:** I know. So, and then there are other people who they think being completely detached from everything is the right thing to do, and it's not. There's a numbness. So all I'm saying is, right, but I'm just pointing out this challenge that keeps coming up in all of the Sanghas where either people are too numbed out thinking that they're doing the right thing, or they're too loving, too giving, and they're also doing the wrong thing. So it's the— it's this learning how to orient to what actually wisdom is.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker C:** Right here in this moment. Mm-hmm. Interested in is how to, how to make that easier for people to, to understand as my, my son hits me with a balloon over my head.

**Speaker A:** Well, just remember to look and to practice by changing over and over and over again. And so when you have thoughts of the future, be mindful of those and the fact of seeing that I'm back into the future again, that I've got to do this in the future, rather than— you can't make choices for the future. You can only respond to what's happening in the present moment.

**Speaker B:** So, Christopher, what do you think?

**Speaker A:** How about you, Mr. Ben?

**Speaker B:** What do you think? Christopher, go ahead, Ben.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, Christopher did unmute his mic, so I think he's here if he wants to talk.

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure I follow you.

**Speaker A:** Just saying Christopher unmuted his mic. Mikey, can you help me with what Ben is saying? Right now I'm not able to understand him.

**Speaker F:** Yes, he said Christopher had unmuted his mic. Now Christopher's mic is muted again, but it looks as though Christopher is still on the call.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. So before we do that, Mr. Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker E:** I think it's good to recognize when the mind's in disease, and it's wonderful to be able to take it easy and not relieve the disease anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we can always learn to take it easy. We have to remember to take it easy.

**Speaker B:** We have to remember to make that change.

**Speaker E:** That comes from— yeah, we don't need to, we don't need to, to be concerned with all the other practitioners in all the other Sanghas and what they're doing and how they're thinking. Just about this mind here and now and this moment here and now and being okay right now.

**Speaker A:** Everything else isn't important. Exactly. So Christopher, you're there. Can you turn your mic on again?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yep, I'm here.

**Speaker B:** What do you think?

**Speaker G:** It's great as always. Good to be in the live version. I still listen to your— I listen to the recordings when I walk my dog. I'm here in spirit. You know, I'm not usually here on the actual time that you have this. I just happened to be on here and saw that it popped up today.

**Speaker A:** It was great being Mikey, can you help me with what Chris has been saying?

**Speaker F:** I didn't catch the last part there, Chris. Your mic's a little low. Could you repeat that, please?

**Speaker G:** I was saying it was just— it was great being here today. I, you know, I usually listen on when I walk my dog, and I'm not usually here live. It was Wonderful to be here and hear everybody else actually be in a live version of it.

**Speaker A:** Good. Good. I'm glad you're here. Is that your hand in the air, Gigi? You got a question? Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Quick question. When you said that Sila, the morality, is the gradual path. My question on that is, I thought it was one of the first things that I was taught. It was like the first things that the Buddha taught people first.

**Speaker A:** So how does that work? That's the gradual path.

**Speaker C:** Okay. But then you said the Buddha— the gradual path, he taught the noble path.

**Speaker A:** The noble path is, is that if your mind is in a good state, if your mind is noble, and you don't want anything, then you're not going to hurt anyone to get it.

**Speaker E:** The morality is the natural outcome of the noble mind.

**Speaker A:** And yet the gradual path— and you know that we teach our children, oh, you got to follow the rules, you got to go to school, you got to shut up, you got to do this, you got to do that— and so the mind is full of rules about how things should be, and we wind up harming ourselves with all of the rules that we have, that in fact it's better to throw out the rules and just be happy. Does that make sense for you?

**Speaker C:** It does make sense in a perfect world where there's an where the noble mind is already noble, but— Right, so make it noble.

**Speaker A:** So make it noble. So make it noble. Again and again and again, come back to having your mind in a noble state.

**Speaker C:** Completely agree with you, Dhammarato. What do we do though with these narcissistic structures in our Sanghas?

**Speaker A:** Dharma, or it just in the world? The world is not your problem. In fact, the world— and this is actually talked about in one of the sutras called the all, like the whole world, all of it, all of those people out there, all those practitioners, etc.— that all is inside your own mind. That those practitioners in all of those Vipassana Sanghas, all of those people on the gradual path, they're in your mind. You don't hardly ever deal with them other than thinking about them. So let us not think about all of those people on the gradual path and say, "Wow, what a relief it is. I can be okay right now, and I don't have to fix the world." In fact, the world does not want you, Gigi, to fix it. Can you imagine yourself storming into one of those Vipassana places and say, "You guys are all doing it wrong. Do it my way." How long do you think that they're going to be listening to you? They're not. No, you can't help them.

**Speaker C:** You can't fix them. You hit the nail. A big structure of mine that I keep having to look at over and over again is the fixer.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. The helper. And you feel bad when you can't help somebody. So start feeling good that you can't help people, because you can't. What a relief!

**Speaker D:** What a relief!

**Speaker A:** What a relief it is. You can't fix the world.

**Speaker E:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** For you.

**Speaker B:** All you can do is enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** As all these years has to say, oh, boundless joy to find it. There is no happiness in the world. Happiness is not in the world. Happiness is in your own mind.

**Speaker B:** So Anna, you had your hand up.

**Speaker H:** Yes, I am in trouble. So I'm reading too much and it's full of me and I don't know what to do. Can you fix it somehow so I'm not obsessed about reading? Don't buy him any booze.

**Speaker A:** They already here. Don't buy it.

**Speaker C:** Pour it out.

**Speaker H:** But it's interesting. It's very interesting. I can't. I just keep clinging to this. I can't. I can't. I just need to do it. And I don't know how to stop.

**Speaker A:** Well, the right way to do it is take that bottle of booze and pour just a little of it out, like 10%. And then later, maybe he takes one drink, pour another 10 or 20% out, and then pour out more. Just pour it out so that there's nothing left to drink. But that pouring it out, pouring out the alcohol, is exactly the same thing as you pouring out your own unwholesome thoughts. It's not your problem whether he drinks or not. Just don't enable him. Don't buy the booze for him. Don't allow the whiskey in the house. How?

**Speaker H:** What, to take out all books?

**Speaker A:** What? It takes a change. You have to make that right noble effort to make the change. Just start pouring out the booze. He brings another bottle of booze in the house. Uh-oh, what happened? A third of it's already gone. And then you pour another half of it out. Here's the important thing about a bottle of whiskey: it's not going to do any good whether someone drinks it or whether it's poured out. In fact, it's better being poured out, which is exactly the same thing as a sandwich that's gotten old in the refrigerator. Whether you eat that old sandwich or not It's going to turn to shit.

**Speaker E:** Panna, were you talking about booze or books? Because I heard reading and books.

**Speaker H:** It's the same thing. It's reading books, but it's the same thing. The point is the same.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, reading books, not drinking booze.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Sorry, I heard that wrong.

**Speaker B:** Anna's right. The point is, but books are just like, it's hard.

**Speaker C:** But what if Bhikkhuni heard?

**Speaker A:** 10 pages every day. The problem with books is that we want to know, so we read a book. We gain some information. But then we want to know more. It's that hunger again, hunger for knowledge. And the best thing to have is to not have that hunger for knowledge. That way, when you read something, you can read it for pure entertainment rather than as a thirst for knowledge. Just pure entertainment. All just enjoy, because we're not looking for something. You're not looking for something to make you feel better, because you already feel great.

**Speaker H:** That's right. I just see in the books what I already know, but I'm still kind of attached. Very interesting. I'm reading only to prove myself that I already know. So it's just I can't stop doing it.

**Speaker A:** It's so weird. Well, enjoy the fact that you already know this information, and you don't need the book to reaffirm that for you.

**Speaker B:** Because you already know.

**Speaker A:** And now you can just read the book for pure entertainment. So Connor, what do you think?

**Speaker I:** I was thinking about how, uh, like what you said reminded me, I guess, like the conversation on like living in the moment and then how that kind of maybe clashes or pairs with ethical living. It made me think about how in Dīgha Nikāya 2, one of the archaic texts of the Pali canon, it has this progression where it talks about ethics in the context of the hindrances, the hindrances to a secluded mental state. Being, you know, they put that first and then they talk about the immersions, the four immersions. And so I was thinking like, you know, you make a very keen point about not having ethics be out there, you know, in the beyond, away from us where we are now. Ethics are right here.

**Speaker F:** They are what allow us to go into seclusion.

**Speaker A:** Or you go into seclusion so that you can find that state if everything is all right, everything is fine. That's right. Now, in Sutta number 36, the Buddha said, uh, and this is the story of the rose apple tree, and the story is, is that he had been practicing with the Jains austerities. And the idea of the austerity is, is to burn off old bad Kamma And then he realized that you're not burning off old bad Kamma, you're just in this present moment doing things that is adding new bad results. You're hurting yourself. And then he came to conclude, why am I afraid of the pleasure of the first Jhana? Then he says, I'm not afraid of the pleasure of the first Jhana. And then he recognized that that is in fact the way of enlightenment, is to have that pleasurable mind state as opposed to being in a state of displeasure. That's basically the whole path. Now, the first Jhana, I don't have time to go into the details, but in the Anapanasati Sutta It talks about Sukkha is a skill to be developed. Thus one trains oneself in Sukkha, but one has to be finished with the hindrances first. You throw out the unwholesome thoughts, and then the wholesome thoughts will bring about that state of Sukkha. Now, what is Sukkha? It's exactly opposite of Dukkha, and it's got several factors. One of them is safe, secure, comfortable, and most the top of the list, and is satisfied. So practice being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, and that is actually then bringing you into the first Jhana. And who needs anything more? Isn't that enough? Why is all— in fact, that's the problem with the gradual path, is they want more Jhanas and more Jhanas. Uh, 4 is not enough, let's have 8, let's have 9, let's go for the whole route. But they haven't ever even gotten the first Jhana yet. So let's not talk about the other Jhanas. Let's get into that state of Sukkha. Let's get into that state where there is no Dukkha. Let's get into that state that's pleasurable. That's all we need. And when you're in that state of pleasurable, you're not harming anyone. Your morality is perfect because you don't want anything. You're unlikely to harm someone to get it.

**Speaker I:** What do you think, Connor? Like it. Um, what you say reminds me of like how the Buddha also says, uh, not to just seek out commensurate views. So like you know, having some dogma that one can fall back on that will, you know, provide some elusive sense of peace. You know, it's like we're to have the dogma that gives us peace now. And I think that makes a lot of sense. That's an intuitive approach. Like, if we're— I don't see how an idea could really give peace on its own.

**Speaker A:** An idea could maybe, you know, deliver us a long way though. Well, you can say it like this: you have been talking yourself into feeling bad your whole life.

**Speaker I:** Now it's time to talk yourself into feeling good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So Ivan, what do you have to say? No, I was thinking about even the Buddha take a hike, right? Like, even the Buddha took a hike from, I think, from the monastery or from the Sangha. Like, even he Anagami cannot control what the monks do or what, and he just took a hike. I was just thinking about that, the same thing with the mind here. Sometimes the mind spins in the world and I just know that, okay, it's time to be in seclusion again, right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** Just remember you're okay. That's all the seclusion you need. If you can get into that state of, wow, everything is all right. So how about you, Mahomer? Is that how you say your name? Yes.

**Speaker B:** I like this idea that we don't have to analyze Dukkha. We just— we can just go straight to feeling good.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that analyzing Dukkha is part of the gradual path. The Buddhist path is out you go.

**Speaker E:** So, Navid, what do you have to say?

**Speaker J:** Dhammarato and friends, I'm gonna tell you, man, I'm the happiest person in this whole Sangha. I cannot even believe the wonderfulness of what you're saying. But you know, I am the emperor of my own pile of shit, and from up here it looks like Shangri-La. And I thank you for it because it looks so beautiful. And yeah, you cut it off, you cut all the shit at the very root of when it comes up. I tell you, today is the day before, or the most dangerous day for men in America, you know, because tomorrow is Valentine's Day. And so I was telling myself, oh shit, I gotta do all these things. And then I thought, this is completely unwholesome. So I was like, you know what, it's gonna be a great day. And so far I've bought a whole bunch of stuff, and everybody— I've had great conversation with everyone. In fact, I'm in the parking lot of the next store I'm gonna go in, but I'm gonna— I'm like, I gotta listen to Dhammarato. It's been a great day. I love it.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yes, you don't have to show things with a Valentine. You can just give them a big smile. So, Alex, what do you have to say?

**Speaker G:** Not a lot.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker E:** Um, thank you very much for reminding us to practice correctly now.

**Speaker G:** Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Nice to hear that. Excellent, excellent. Okay, Mikey, why don't you take this thing away?

**Speaker F:** Gladly. Yeah, thanks friends for being here today. If you're watching this on YouTube, check out the video description and come join us here on the Dhamma Friends Discord.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a core distinction between two approaches to spiritual practice: the **"gradual path"** and the **"immediate path"** (the Noble Path).

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Thesis: The Immediate vs. The Gradual Path
*   **The Gradual Path:** This is described as the common, societal approach to life and even to much of modern Buddhism. It is characterized by postponement, striving for future goals (like enlightenment, deep meditation states, or life milestones), and dealing with symptoms rather than root causes. It leads to perpetual dissatisfaction (*dukkha*), as fulfilling one desire simply leads to another. Examples include formal meditation retreats, complex doctrines, and the idea that one has "a lot of work to do."
*   **The Immediate Path (The Noble Path):** This is presented as the Buddha's essential teaching. It is available **right here, right now**. The practice is to see unwholesome states of mind (hindrances, *dukkha*) as they arise in the present moment and immediately change or release them. The benefit—joy, peace, lightness—is instantaneous.

### Key Practices and Principles of the Immediate Path:
1.  **Present-Moment Awareness:** The practice is **Sati**—remembering to come back to the present moment to observe the mind's activity. This can be done anywhere, anytime, not just in formal meditation.
2.  **The "Two-Step" Enlightenment:**
    *   **Step 1 (Turning on the lights):** Seeing/knowing what the mind is doing (e.g., recognizing anger, worry, or desire).
    *   **Step 2 (Lightening the load):** Letting go of that unwholesome state immediately. This is the deliverance.
3.  **Change Model, Not Analysis:** The path is about **changing** the mind's state from unwholesome to wholesome, not merely noting or analyzing suffering. The analogy given: if you see dog excrement (*dukkha*) on the path, you step around it immediately; you don't study it or step in it.
4.  **Cultivate Joy and Satisfaction (*Sukha*):** The goal is to cultivate a mind that is safe, secure, comfortable, and **satisfied** in the present. This wholesome, joyful state is the antidote to *dukkha* and naturally leads to ethical behavior.
5.  **Morality Follows the Mind:** True morality (*Sila*) is a natural outcome of a peaceful, satisfied mind that doesn't want anything. The gradual path tries to impose morality first to achieve peace; the Noble Path cultivates peace first, from which morality flows.

### Critiques of Common Misconceptions (The Gradual Path):
*   **Formal "Meditation":** The talk cautions against limiting practice to specific times, places, and postures. True *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) is a moment-to-moment awareness.
*   **"Going Deep":** The idea that one must go on retreats or enter deep trances to root out "deep" defilements is challenged. Defilements are seen as surface-level thoughts that can be addressed as they arise.
*   **Enlightenment as a Future Goal:** Enlightenment is reframed as the immediate act of "turning on the lights" and "lightening the load," not a distant achievement.
*   **Choiceless Awareness:** Practices that advocate mere awareness without choice are seen as passive and insufficient. The Buddha's path is about making the wise choice to abandon unwholesome states.

### Practical Advice:
*   Practice many times a day (e.g., 5-12 brief moments of remembering), not just one long session.
*   Shift identity from a **victim** of circumstances to a **champion** or **emperor** of your own mind.
*   The "work" is not a heavy burden but a joyful play of remembering and releasing.
*   You cannot fix the world or other people; true happiness is found only in your own mind.

### Overall Message:
The Dhamma is for immediate benefit. Stop postponing peace and joy. Remember to look at your mind **now**, see the unwholesome thought, and change it **now**. Through this simple, repeated practice, life can be transformed not in years, but in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a few **stories** to illustrate the difference between the "gradual path" and the "immediate path" of Buddhist practice.

### Key Metaphors Used:

1.  **Medical Treatment:**
    *   **Pharmaceuticals vs. Cure:** The gradual path is compared to pharmaceutical companies treating symptoms, while the Noble Path (Dharma) is the actual cure for the "spiritual disease."

2.  **Tree Roots:**
    *   **Surface Roots vs. Deep Roots:** The common belief that tree roots go very deep is challenged. The speaker says roots spread out near the surface for nourishment. This metaphor argues that we don't need to "go deep" into meditation to find defilements; they are at the surface of the mind, where we can deal with them immediately.

3.  **Dirt and the Emperor:**
    *   **Emperor of Your Own Pile of Dirt:** Everyone is an emperor of their own "pile of dirt" (their mind/life). On the gradual path, people are buried under it and struggle. On the Noble Path, you "pop right up" and reign from the top, in charge.

4.  **Car Wash:**
    *   **Washing the Mind:** The mind getting dirty with unwholesome thoughts is compared to a car getting muddy. On the gradual path, you keep thinking "I need to take it to the car wash" but postpone it. The immediate path is washing the mind (changing the thought) right now.

5.  **Hunger and Satisfaction:**
    *   **The Cycle of Hunger:** The ordinary mind is in a cycle of hunger (for knowledge, comfort, etc.) and temporary fulfillment. The practice is to change that hunger into satisfaction right now, breaking the cycle.

6.  **Dog Doodle on the Path:**
    *   **Stepping Around Dukkha:** This is a central, vivid metaphor for dealing with suffering (Dukkha).
        *   **Choiceless Awareness:** Stepping right in it.
        *   **Mahasi (Vipassana) Noting:** Taking it home, analyzing it, and "eating" it.
        *   **The Noble Path:** Seeing it and immediately stepping around it. Don't engage with the Dukkha; avoid it.

7.  **Light:**
    *   **Enlightenment as "Turning the Lights On":** Enlightenment is framed in two steps: 1) Turning the lights on (seeing/understanding the mind), and 2) Lightening the load (letting go of what you see).

8.  **The Common Cold:**
    *   **Catching and Curing Defilements:** The mind is like catching a cold (unwholesome thoughts). The practice is to cure yourself quickly each time it happens, not to expect a one-time permanent cure.

### Stories and Anecdotes:

1.  **The Story of "Tathagata":** The speaker recounts a story of a person (before becoming a monk) who called a famous teacher. The teacher said she saw her defilements and wanted to go on *another* retreat to "go deep" to solve them. The point is that on the immediate path, if you see defilements now, you fix them now, you don't postpone the work.

2.  **The Rose Apple Tree (Sutta 36 Reference):** The speaker briefly references the story of the Buddha under the rose apple tree, where he realized his ascetic practices (austerities) were just creating new suffering, and he shouldn't be afraid of the pleasure of the first Jhana. This story supports the argument for seeking a pleasurable, satisfied mind state now.

3.  **Anecdote about Nick:** The speaker mentions a student, Nick, who said he "has much work to do." This is used as a real-time example of the gradual-path mentality that the talk is critiquing.

4.  **Anecdote about Pouring Out Booze/Books:** In the Q&A, a participant (Anna) talks about an obsession with reading. The speaker initially misunderstands and tells a story-like strategy of dealing with a partner's alcoholism by gradually pouring out the booze to illustrate the principle of gradually removing the source of the problem (whether alcohol or, by analogy, the compulsive hunger for knowledge).

### Summary:
The metaphors are predominantly **contrasts** between **postponement, complexity, and struggle** (gradual path) and **immediacy, simplicity, and release** (Noble Path). The stories serve as concrete examples of people falling into the "gradual path" trap or, in the Buddha's case, discovering the immediate one. The "dog doodle" metaphor is perhaps the most memorable and central image for the talk's core instruction.
