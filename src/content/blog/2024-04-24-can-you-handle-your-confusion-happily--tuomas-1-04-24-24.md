### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So according to the teaching of the Buddha, there are three kinds of feelings. And those three kinds of feelings are plagued with ignorance. And the three kinds are liking, not liking, and not sure whether we like it or not, sort of like both a mixed or a neither one. And that's what rises in the state of confusion. Now, the thing about confusion is that people don't like it, which in fact brings it back down to two kinds of feelings: liking and not liking. But generally, when we don't know whether we like it or not, we don't like not knowing whether we like it or not. Yeah, and so this is what gives rise to the thirst for knowledge. We want to know, and that's not only buried in our DNA, but it also is supported by the culture because all of the other 8 billion people on the planet Earth are ignorant about their feelings of confusion. And so, when Mommy's confused, little Johnny understands to be confused by learning how to be confused by watching Mommy be confused. And Mommy is acting confused in an ignorant way, and so Johnny learns to practice ignorance that way. Humans are very much monkey see, monkey do. Do as I do, not do as I say.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, everybody goes around saying, do what I say to do, don't do what I do. Big— actually, that's a major part of the teaching of the Buddha, is that most of the people who practice practice meditation, try to practice the way that the Buddha was practicing when he was doing it wrong. And he spent 6 years, 7 years doing it wrong. He went to the absolute extremes in both cases. To the extremes of the jhanas, as high a jhana as they can go, whatever they are for counting, he was able to do it. And he found it unsatisfactory. Hear me now, he found it unsatisfactory. He had gone too far. And so then, for quite a number number of months, we're not exactly sure how long, but he was with the Mahayana, with Jains, practicing the austerities. And one of the things that he did, he almost starved himself to death, down to one grain of rice a day, bringing on the images that you've seen before, probably the Starving Buddha, the Fasting Buddha, right? And he found that that extreme was way over extreme. And so what he wound up with is finding the middle path, and the middle path is a happy place. It's between the extremes of those high Jhanas and the extremes of self-flagellation. And we call that, in fact, the first Jhana. He said in Sutra number 36, why am I afraid of this first Jhana? That the pleasures of first jhana are not the same thing as sensual pleasures like getting drunk and going to the brothel, taking drugs and looking for pleasure on the outside. It is actually capable of manufacturing that pleasure right in the mind. And so when we're not in that place, we're in hindrances, which means we're critical of ourselves. It's almost like a flagellation. It's almost like the austerities. Instead of beating ourselves with a whip on the back, we beat ourselves with a whip in our heart or in our mind. We're critical of ourselves rather than being nurturing. And we've gotten quite a habit of it. You learned how to do it from Mom, and Mom was an expert at being confused. So we learn how to be confused, and we don't like it. In fact, we could be very happily confused. Oh, I'm confused, and it doesn't matter. I don't know, and that's just fine. In fact, the Buddha gave a list of things about what we don't know and never will know. Like, for instance, you've probably been somewhat exposed to— started with Richard Dawkins, but it wound up with Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett and some physicists out of the University of Phoenix. And they went around having debates with Christians over whether God exists or not, and they also would debate about the Big Bang theory and how everything got started. But the Buddha says we don't know how things got started. There's no reason to chase back in the past to find out how things started. What we really need to do is investigate how things are right now. Never mind where they came from. Here it is. We don't need a God to create things. Things are just created. We don't have to figure out whodunit. So God the Creator is kind of irrelevant because we don't know. Nobody knows what creation is. In fact, we make a big mistake by thinking that creation happened, as if it were a noun, as if it happened a long time ago, to where in fact reality is constantly in motion, is constantly in a state of being recreated and creating. Nothing stands still. Everything is in motion. This is the major teaching of the Buddha on Anicca. Everything is on the move. And we don't have to go back to see where things came from, not very far, not more than 10 seconds anyway. And so we can forget all about what happened in the beginning. We don't need to be confused about that. In fact, in these halls where they would have these debates, they'd either have it at a university or at a church, and when it was at a university, it was full of college students, and when it was at a church, it was full of the congregation of that church. And in either case, no matter who said what, Either the preacher on one side or the atheist on the other, nobody in the audience changed their mind. They were never convinced for the other side. So they don't have those debates anymore. They were useless. Because everybody thinks they know what the answer is, and Buddha's answer is, I don't give a flying rip. So much for confusion, huh? So another one that people get into is, and I've seen this both in Thailand and especially India, is that they blame other people's bad situation on their karma. All right, like all that's your Kamma that's coming in. And the Buddha says you do not know the results of good and bad actions. In fact, we don't even know if actions are good or bad if we don't know the result. And sometimes the results happen and we don't know it, and sometimes the results never happen. An example of that would be a shoplifter, and he was caught on camera, and the cops are outside the store, but here he is walking past the checkout thinking that he got away with it. 10 seconds later, he figures out he didn't. So we don't know what the future is going to be. We don't know how things happen. We don't know the results of good and bad actions. So that leaves a lot of confusion. Are you going to be able to handle your confusion happily? Because there's a whole bunch of stuff you don't know. And yet a lot of people who get interested in the Dhamma, they don't figure that out, and they wind up being Pali scholars and write translations and write books, all because they're confused. They don't like being confused. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Go ahead. It's not where the word trust would come in. I think there's a polyword for that.

**Speaker A:** Say again?

**Speaker B:** Trust, trust, like trusting, trusting the teaching.

**Speaker A:** Trusting the— The Buddha was not very big on faith and trust. The trust and faith is wanting something to happen and thinking that it will. Faith is like that too, like faith in Jesus. You don't know whether there's a Jesus. You don't know whether he's going to save you or not. And everybody knows that. That's why the churches keep talking about you have to have faith in Jesus. Which means that you're in a state of delusion. You don't know, but you hope it's going to happen. The Buddha was actually pretty big on investigation and having direct knowledge, direct vision, so that you will know. And when you keep knowing things over and over again, that builds confidence. Incompetence is not the same as faith. And yet the Pali scholars have translated the word Saddha or Shraddha into the word faith, and it doesn't mean faith at all. Faith is actually ignorance. It's raw ignorance. It's stupidity. That's what prayer is. They pray to God. They don't know if there's a God or not, and they don't know whether prayer works or not, but they do it because they have faith in it, right? Buddha didn't teach faith. He taught investigation. Look at what you're doing. See what's going on. Because in fact, all of that stuff that you could know, you don't need to know. You only need to know a few things, like how to be happy. You have to practice that over and over and over again to come out of the confusion and come into being in the state of happiness. Now, that's different. Being in a state of happiness or satisfaction is different than liking things. Because liking almost always ignorantly leads to wanting them. Well, if you look at it this way, wanting something that you don't have means that you would be better off if you did have it, which means wanting something that you don't have puts you in a state of mind of being incomplete, not good enough, and you don't like that feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And there— and the people are ignorant of that. They want that car, but they don't recognize how much trouble wanting that car causes them. So if they want it, then they've got to work really hard to get it. And once they get it, they see it as precious, and they work really hard to keep it. And then they lose it anyway. So Dukkha from the beginning, Dukkha in the middle, and Dukkha in the end, especially when they've lost something that they thought was important. And they thought it was important because they wanted it so bad. And all of that's based in ignorance. If we can see that, then we can catch that wanting or that liking and stop it right there, just to like it. And in fact, there's an old story about Ajahn Sumedho and Ajahn Chah, where they were sitting in a ceremony with lots of young Thai girls all dressed up looking for a husband. And Ajahn Chah asked Ajahn Sumedho, "Do you like it?" Or, "What do you think?" is what he asked. And Ajahn Sumedho says, I like it, but I don't want it. Okay, now that's wisdom, to know that you like something but you don't want it. You can like a pretty girl, but you don't want her. But most guys, if they like it, they want her. They can't make that connection. They're in confusion. They think if they like it, they should have it. I like it now, I'll like it later when I can keep it close by, and I'll keep liking it. And the answer to that is no. Things change. Embraces last short periods of time.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So what comes to mind is renunciation. That you don't renunciate feeling okay, feeling good, having pleasures, but renouncing being attached to them, being in need of them.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the Buddha has said that renunciation is what ordinary people do. It's not a noble action. It's ordinary. Why is that? It's because if we renounce something, then we're setting ourselves up for failure. An example of that would be the ceremony, because that's what renunciation is.

**Speaker B:** Is.

**Speaker A:** That the vows of fidelity in a marriage is a kind of renunciation. And then both partners eventually regret that marriage, that's why divorce is so high.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah. But also renouncing the attitudes of not liking and liking.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's another way of thinking is that if you renounce it and then catch yourself doing it, then how do you feel? All right.

**Speaker B:** There's Dukkha then. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So it's creation of Dukkha by renouncing. The better way to do it, or maybe the renunciation to have, would be, "I will look at what's going on. I vow to see what's happening." So when you catch yourself breaking some stupid vow, then you can say, "Aha, I see that." begin to see our bad behavior, our broken promises, see them delightfully. That I see my own ignorance, I can see that I've screwed that up. Yeah, and then we can love ourselves, warts and all. Don't hate yourself for all your wrongdoing, love yourself for seeing your wrongdoing. So this is the way of taking the ignorance out of the feelings. When we feel some way, know how we feel. And if we know how to feel, then that means that we can take the appropriate measure for it. Ignorance, we're not going to take the appropriate measure. So, if I like something, I want it. If I want it, I got to get it. If I get it, I got to put up with it. So, if we can see, "I like it," and we can see that with wisdom, we can say, "Yeah, I see that I like it." But I don't want it, I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** The thing that comes to mind right now is the— what, when Metta practice has worked very well for me, the state which arises is, I think, that I can remember now, the most pleasant. And there's definitely Liking and wanting that state sometimes. Of course, when there's that, it never arises.

**Speaker A:** I caution people to be careful about the word Metta, especially when it's taught in the regard of may all beings be happy. Yes. All right. Why is that? Is because you can't make all beings be happy.

**Speaker B:** Happy?

**Speaker A:** That's a stupid, fruitless kind of thing to do. Nobody's got enough money to make everybody happy. Nobody's got enough smiles to make everybody happy. Even if you're on television, a national star, most of the people are not watching you, they're watching something unhappy. So you can't make everybody happy. Not only that, but where did that joy come from? So, 'May all beings be happy' dooms someone for failure, but they can change their attitude and change their language just a bit, so that 'May I radiate joy.' Oh yeah, just let it out. You don't have to see, you don't have to worry about where it's going to go or what the results are. I don't have to think everybody's going to be happy. But I can spread joy. Yeah, if I've got some to spread. So let's cultivate some. Let's plant the seeds of joy, water them, and let them grow into a tall fruit tree. Cultivate. That word cultivate is also thus one trains oneself. To train yourself into being in a good state, being in a good mood rather than being confused. So instead of worrying about how do I make everybody happy, I don't have to make everybody happy. That's a stupid thing to say. I don't have to worry about it. I could just make one person happy some of the time. So let's practice on that sometime.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Also now when I see there is joy that is at the same time contracting, it's not relaxing joy, it's contracting joy. So is it possible to ease into.

**Speaker A:** It, to relax into it?[No speech] My dad had a phrase. He was a blue-collar worker. He had to dig holes and thread pipes. He didn't have— in those days they didn't have plastic. They had to use iron piping, steel piping, and all of that kind of stuff. But he did say, work— I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside it and go to sleep. Okay, so you can translate that to your problems. Whatever problems that you have, whatever problems you can come up with, you say, problems— I'm not afraid of problems. I can lay down beside those problems and go to sleep. Just rest.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** Let me ask you a question. When you first called, you announced that you had excitement and fear. Do you still have that?

**Speaker B:** There is some excitement at the head, but below the head, it's just this calm, pleasant, warm, and there is definitely safety. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Everything'S okay now, huh? Yes.

**Speaker B:** It'S very— feels very good. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is the right way to practice. Is to remember to take a look at what we're thinking, what we're doing, and then make a change for the better. If we're confused, okay, I'm confused, never mind, I don't know, I'll figure it out, don't have to worry about it. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if I don't figure it out, that's okay too. Some things you'll never figure out. Like.

**Speaker B:** Women.

**Speaker A:** Men, you'll never figure them out. Did Jesus exist or not? You'll never figure it out. Is Santa Claus real? You'll never figure it out. Better just to be happy without knowing. Yes.

**Speaker B:** It's very funny how sometimes, when it's noticed that the mind wants to know something, then what can happen is the mind wants to know how to stop wanting. On how to let go of wanting to know. If.

**Speaker A:** I can remember, oh, there I am wanting to know something. Wow, I'm confused and I want knowledge. Yeah, the answer is to say, yeah, but I don't need it right now. I'm okay. To be confused. We'll get her done.

**Speaker B:** And Mr. Confidence, more like being confident that right now, whatever happens, I'm okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, we don't know what's going to happen. The confidence is that whatever happens, I can handle it. It. Whatever happens, I'll be okay. Whatever happens, I'm still the boss. I'm the boss of what? Boss of my feelings, not the boss of other people. But I'm the boss here, and I can feel the way I want to feel. I'm trained that way. Don't know what's going to happen, but we do know that we can handle it. That's confidence, to know no matter how obstructed the mind gets, we can throw that stuff out and see things the way that they really are. The Buddha, by the way, calls this state the first knowledge. This is really, really first wholesome knowledge, because what it is, it's an attitude change. Because most of us are victims. We are born victims, raised victims. We're victims in school. We're victims of the bully. We're victims of the cops. We're victims of the government. We're victims of the book we're trying to read. We're victims of the car when it has a flat. If you own a house, nope, you don't, it owns you and you're a victim to that house. When the toilet gets stopped up, the house says, you, you own me, or actually I own you. All right, so we're victimized by everything. And this attitude that I'm talking about is, no, I'm not a victim to everything, I'm the boss here. Because really what the Victimization is, is the victim about how we feel? When the toilet gets blocked up, am I happy that the toilet gets blocked up, or am I unhappy that the toilet gets blocked up? My choice. Can I unblock the toilet happily, or do I have to be miserable to unblock the toilet? So we have a choice, but we have to practice it because the default position is to go into unhappiness. Whenever anything happens, the default is to go be a victim. We started off as a victim, we practiced as a victim, we've been practicing feeling bad our whole lives. So now it's time to practice feeling good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I've already noticed this, and there happened that something tipped over and everything, like kind of water goes everywhere, food goes everywhere, stuff like that. Before, there was this immediate contraction, and now, now there is kind of almost like it seems funny, like it kind of brings a bit of joy and humor that when that happens. And I noticed that there still might be an initial small, very quick contraction, but then that is noticed, and then you're just enjoying what happened without trying to have this attitude that, oh no, I have to do something, I have to clean it up, I don't like it, this was a mistake.

**Speaker A:** Well, now you know that if you practice well, you'll have a choice with every event. Whatever happens, you can have an attitude of, I can do this, I can handle this.

**Speaker B:** And then also, if the choice is made first that I don't like it, it can be changed the next moment to, I like this. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Well, good. You go practice this more and more. Give me a call in the next several days or so. All right, so let's go ahead and finish this call now, and you go practice being in control of your life, feeling the way you want to feel. Thomas, and we'll see you later. Thank.

**Speaker B:** You, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on moving from **confusion and reactivity to clarity and happiness through practical investigation and attitude change.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Problem: Ignorance in Feelings**
* All experience arises with one of three feelings: **liking, disliking, or confusion/uncertainty**.
* We are generally ignorant of these feelings. Crucially, we **dislike the feeling of confusion itself**, which creates a "thirst for knowledge" and perpetuates suffering.
* This ignorant reactivity is a learned habit, passed down culturally ("monkey see, monkey do").

**2. The Buddha's Discovery: The Middle Path**
* The Buddha found extremes—both of intense meditative absorption (*jhana*) and severe austerity—to be unsatisfactory.
* He discovered the **Middle Path**, which is a "happy place," epitomized by the **first jhana**. This is a pleasure born from the mind itself, not from external sensual pursuits.
* When not on this path, we are in a state of "hindrances," which is likened to mental self-flagellation—being critical and unkind to ourselves.

**3. Embracing "Not Knowing"**
* A major cause of confusion is trying to know the unknowable (e.g., the origin of the universe, the precise results of karma, theological debates).
* The Buddha's approach is to **let go of these unanswerable questions** and instead **investigate present-moment experience**. Happiness comes from being okay with not knowing.

**4. From Faith to Investigation & Confidence**
* The Buddha did not teach **faith** (which is rooted in hope and delusion), but **investigation** (*vipassanā*) for **direct knowledge**.
* Repeated direct understanding builds **confidence** (*saddhā*), which is different from blind faith. It's the confidence that you can understand your mind and handle whatever arises.

**5. Wisdom with Feelings: Liking vs. Wanting**
* A key insight is to **separate liking from wanting**. You can like something (e.g., find someone attractive) without the ignorant, craving-based impulse to possess it ("I like it, but I don't want it").
* **Renunciation** as a stern vow often sets us up for failure and self-judgment. A wiser "renunciation" is the **vow to see clearly**, to observe our reactions with kindness rather than hatred.

**6. Practical Attitude Change: From Victim to "The Boss"**
* Our default, learned position is to be a **victim** of circumstances, reacting with unhappiness to life's inevitable problems (e.g., a spilled glass, a blocked toilet).
* The core practice is an **attitude shift**: realizing you are **"the boss" of your feelings**. You can choose your internal response.
* The goal is to **cultivate joy internally** and radiate it, rather than fruitlessly trying to "make all beings happy."
* The "**first knowledge**" is this very shift from a victim mentality to the confident understanding that you can handle anything and choose happiness.

**Conclusion: The Practice**
* The talk ends with an embodied example: the practitioner (Speaker B) notices how a previous reaction of contraction to a mess has been replaced with humor and ease.
* The instruction is to **practice this choice point in daily life**: see your reactive feelings (liking, disliking, confusion), investigate them without judgment, and consciously choose an attitude of "I can handle this happily."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate Buddhist teachings and psychological insights. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Monkey see, monkey do."** – Used to describe how humans, especially children, learn ignorance and confusion by imitating the behavior of others (like a confused mother).
2.  **Beating oneself with a whip in the heart/mind.** – A metaphor for self-criticism and mental flagellation, paralleling the physical austerities the Buddha rejected.
3.  **Cultivating joy like a fruit tree.** – The process of training the mind is compared to planting seeds, watering them, and letting them grow into a tall, fruit-bearing tree.
4.  **The house owns you.** – A metaphor for how possessions (like a house with a blocked toilet) can make us feel like victims, enslaved to maintenance and problems.
5.  **"I can lay down beside [work/problems] and go to sleep."** – A folksy saying (attributed to the speaker's father) that metaphorically advises resting peacefully alongside challenges rather than being agitated by them.
6.  **"Boss" of one's feelings.** – Contrasted with being a "victim," this metaphor advocates for an internal locus of control and the ability to choose one's emotional response.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha's Path to the Middle Way:**
    *   The story of Siddhartha Gautama's extreme practices before his enlightenment. He mastered the high **jhanas** (meditative absorptions) but found them unsatisfactory. He then practiced severe **austerities** (like eating only one grain of rice a day, referenced by the "Starving Buddha" image) and found that too extreme. This led him to discover the **Middle Path**, a balanced and happy place exemplified by the first jhana.

2.  **The Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho Story:**
    *   At a ceremony with young women, Ajahn Chah asks Ajahn Sumedho what he thinks. Sumedho replies, **"I like it, but I don't want it."** This story illustrates the crucial distinction between **liking** (a feeling) and **wanting** (a craving born of ignorance), which is presented as a mark of wisdom.

3.  **The Futility of Debates on Origins:**
    *   The speaker references debates between atheists (like Dawkins, Hitchens) and theists about God and the origin of the universe. The Buddha's position, as presented, is that such debates are useless because **"nobody in the audience changed their mind."** The point is to abandon the confused quest for ultimate beginnings and investigate present reality instead.

4.  **The Shoplifter Example:**
    *   A story of a shoplifter who thinks he's gotten away with his crime but is caught moments later. This illustrates the teaching that **we cannot know the results of actions (kamma)** with certainty, as outcomes are often hidden or delayed.

5.  **The Problem with "May All Beings Be Happy" (Metta Practice):**
    *   The speaker critiques a common interpretation of loving-kindness (*metta*) meditation. The wish to make *all* beings happy is called a **"stupid, fruitless kind of thing to do"** that sets one up for failure. The better approach is to **"radiate joy"** from within, without attachment to the outcome—like cultivating a personal fruit tree of joy to share.

### **Overall Narrative Metaphor**
The entire talk is framed around a journey from **confusion** (and disliking confusion) to **happy confusion** and ultimately to **confident well-being**. The metaphors and stories serve as landmarks on this path:
*   We start as **"monkeys"** imitating confusion.
*   We learn we've been **"whipping"** ourselves mentally.
*   We hear the story of the Buddha to avoid **extremes**.
*   We learn from Ajahn Sumedho to **like without wanting**.
*   We stop futile **debates** and **shoplifting** for certainty.
*   We shift from trying to fix the world to **cultivating our own garden** of joy.
*   We learn to **"lie down beside"** problems and become the **"boss"** of our inner state, breaking free from **victimhood**.

This combination of vivid metaphors and illustrative stories makes the philosophical and psychological teachings concrete and memorable.
