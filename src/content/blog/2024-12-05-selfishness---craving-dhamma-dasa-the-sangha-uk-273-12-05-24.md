### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I suddenly like think like, okay, maybe it's not right for me this way. Maybe I have to change something. Maybe I have to give up my school here and do something else. Maybe I should move into a community, you know, all kinds of thoughts. And usually after 3, 4 days, I start again, because I'm refreshed, I'm more— I slept more and so on, and so maybe I start again and I go back to school. But—.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's a question for you. Yeah, here's a question for you. Why do you wait 3 or 4 or 5 days before you start looking at your thoughts to see how unwholesome they are. If you said that you'd been practicing, now you're telling me that you're not.

**Speaker A:** Well, I am, but like, this is— it's like, uh, It's almost out of control. I mean, independent.

**Speaker B:** No, they're not out of control. That's just another unwholesome thought. I see you. That's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** So should I just keep going and trying to throw some morals on thoughts. I try to not stop.

**Speaker B:** Actually, the correct word that I would use is to remember to look.

**Speaker A:** To.

**Speaker B:** Remember to look at your thoughts. Practice every day to remember to look at your thoughts so that you can start to have wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Instead of letting those thoughts just run wild, saying that they're out of control, which is just another unwholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I, I thought I've done that, but you know It happens anyway, so like, yeah, probably more, more deep. I wanted to think maybe I'm uncovering stuff.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Oh, maybe I'm uncovering stuff, uh, more deep stuff. I don't know, something like that.

**Speaker B:** And there is nothing deep. Everything is right there on the surface, and it happens over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, why it looks like it's so cyclical? Like, maybe I, I think like I'm, I'm doing practice, sustained practice during the day, and I, I feel like, okay, like this is quite like almost for Jhana, like I'm, I keep up the good thoughts and so on. And suddenly after some time I completely shut down, you know, it's like, yeah, okay, it becomes really physical, it becomes really physical, you know.

**Speaker B:** No, it's not physical, it's mental. And the shutting down is mental.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And when you do shut down, can you see that you're shutting down and say, hey, I don't have to do that, I can still watch? So really is what's happened is, is that after all of this time, you've actually started to change the practice rather than keeping it correct. Because you said things like that, you've let it go 4 or 5 days, 3 or 4 days being down instead of catching that after 3 or 4 minutes, or maybe even 3 or 4 seconds. You can catch that stuff and say, hey, I can do better than this. I can have more wholesome thoughts than this. Yeah, and this is why we recommend that you practice not just once a day but throughout the day. That I would go so far as to say start— and you can do this with an alarm on your phone to let the alarm go off once an hour. And every time the alarm goes off, you can say, all right, now's the time to remember to have good wholesome thoughts. And then you start practicing looking, because if you did that, then you would interrupt that stuff before it goes for 3, 4, 5 days. Start interrupting it. So this is what I recommend. That you start practicing often.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah. 10 minutes more times a day. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, practicing having thoughts of, I can do this, I can be kind to my friends, I can put a smile on my face. I can do this. I don't have to be a victim of these unwholesome thoughts, thinking that they're powerful. Those are just victim thoughts. Having winner's thoughts like, I can do this, those thoughts can't manage my life, I'm going to do that according to wisdom.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you. That helps.

**Speaker B:** Now don't feel bad because I'm saying this, but basically it happens to everyone. When people stop calling and stop reinforcing and stop having good noble friends, we begin to take on the habits of the people who are around us. You begin to be what your environment presents to you. And so this is why I would recommend, Pedro, is that you get back into it. And in fact, I've got a good friend for you. His name is Jesus. He's, I think, Spanish.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, I remember Jesus. Yes, Jesus.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right. So Get in touch with him, start having conversations with him. He also has a lot of knowledge about wats and places in Italy. He knows all of what's going on in Europe.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes.

**Speaker B:** So while you've been going to school and feeling bad, he's been Wad hopping. Oh gosh.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, definitely have to come back in the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Yes, come back into the Sangha. Start having some noble friends.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, like I went, went with my mind, you know, and say, okay, now time to to try to be on your own and try to see what you can accomplish alone and so on. But definitely after one year and a half, I've maybe lost a bit of, you know, adherence to the principle of the Dharma. So maybe I twisted into my way.

**Speaker B:** Yes, come back, come back and start having noble friendships. Come back and start thinking about and talking about the Dharma, to remember the Dharma, to remember you don't have to go deep in your own old crap. That's just an old bad habit. And when I see— when I use the word deep, perhaps a better word would be often.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so we're not going to go deep, we're going to go often.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, yeah. So please, uh, if you can send me the links to the group so that I can join. Now maybe I can find that online. No, no problem.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, there is all online. Uh, go to any of the YouTubes. Yes, because you, you know our YouTube channel.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And every one of the new— yeah, the newest ones have the most, uh, up-to-date links.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And we have the Sangha Group, uh, UK, and the Sangha Group US, and, and an active Discord.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And some other groups. Now we also have a working website now.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I visited like last month, I believe, out of curiosity. Last month, yeah, I think I've seen the website, I believe. I have to check it out.

**Speaker B:** There's too many people involved.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I will check it out. Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So that would be the first thing that I would recommend is get back in the flow, get back into the Dhamma saddle again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, we— best for me. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Maybe listening to some videos.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Yes, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now there's one, there's one thing about it, and that is, is that.

**Speaker A:** Um.

**Speaker B:** Of all the very, very many millions and millions of people who have heard the teachings of the Buddha Most of them don't practice, and those who do practice, most of them practice wrongly. And so that leaves those who are practicing correctly in a very small minority. And in that small minority, those who are practicing correctly get great benefit. Great fruit. And that in fact, they begin to get the great fruits so that they can, because they see how valuable it is, they want to practice more. But over time, if you don't have any friends and you don't hear any Dhamma, then we can get reabsorbed into society. Back into school, back into the other students. And those other students, there's not very many wise sages in that group.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** And so coming back to the Sangha would be the right thing to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes.

**Speaker B:** Come be in that very small minority. Very few people actually practice well enough to be happy. Everybody's chasing happiness, but they're chasing it in the wrong way. Why? Because they listen to the people in society who are chasing happiness in the wrong way. Or as the song says, looking for love in all the wrong places. Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Instead of within your own mind, that's where happiness will be. But you have to actually change the unhappiness to happiness. You have to change all of those unsatisfying thoughts into satisfying thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Change those fearful thoughts into, um, Thoughts of safety and security. Change all those uncomfortable thoughts to comfortable thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Thoughts like, oh, this is hard to do, into I can do this. Okay, I can be happy, I can do it. What a relief it is. You can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you, Dhammarato. I needed this refreshment. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** I know everyone needs it. Everybody needs to keep coming back to the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** So you get in touch with, uh, uh, Jesus.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Tell him your situation. Get him to advise you because he's been in the Dharma all of this time. He's been at Amravati. He's been at, uh, a wat in Portugal. He's been in wats in, uh, uh, Italy, I think.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, yes. Okay, thank you that much.

**Speaker B:** Let me see you on the groups too. All right, start posting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I will, I will.

**Speaker B:** Say something like, wow, it's been a long time and I'm really glad to be back here again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because we got a lot of old friends that you'll remember.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** So are you going to start practicing?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I will, Dhammarato, I will.

**Speaker B:** All right, so you start practicing and then give me a call. Okay, call me next week.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Thank you again, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker B:** And I'm really happy to see you again at long last. It's been quite a while.

**Speaker A:** The same for me. Thank you, Dhammarato. Bye.

**Speaker B:** All right. Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and advice given by Dhammarato (Speaker B) to a practitioner (Speaker A, likely named Pedro) who has been struggling:

**Core Problem:** The practitioner has been isolating himself from the Sangha (spiritual community) for about a year and a half to "go it alone." During this time, he experiences cyclical crashes in his practice—periods of good, sustained practice followed by several days of "shutdown," unwholesome thoughts, and doubt about his path (e.g., quitting school, moving).

**Dhammarato's Diagnosis & Core Teachings:**

1.  **The Issue is Mental, Not Physical:** The practitioner describes his "shutdown" as physical, but Dhammarato corrects him—it's a mental event, a choice to stop watching the mind.
2.  **"Out of Control" is an Unwholesome Thought:** The feeling that thoughts are "out of control" is itself an unwholesome, disempowering thought. It reinforces a victim mentality.
3.  **There's Nothing "Deep" to Uncover:** The practitioner speculates he's uncovering deep issues. Dhammarato counters that the patterns are surface-level and repetitive, not mysterious profundities needing excavation.
4.  **The Error is in the Timing & Frequency of Practice:** The main mistake is allowing unwholesome thought patterns to run for **days** instead of intercepting them within **seconds or minutes**. The practice has become too infrequent.

**Prescribed Solutions & Advice:**

1.  **Practice "Often," Not "Deep":** Shift the focus from occasional, intense practice to frequent, momentary check-ins throughout the day.
2.  **Use "Remembering to Look":** The core technique is to **remember to look at your thoughts** as they arise to evaluate if they are wholesome or unwholesome.
3.  **Implement Frequent Reminders:** Set an alarm to go off **once every hour**. When it rings, use that moment to "remember to look" and consciously cultivate wholesome thoughts.
4.  **Cultivate "Winner's Thoughts":** Actively replace unwholesome thoughts (e.g., "This is hard," "I can't control this") with empowering, wholesome ones (e.g., "I can do this," "I can be kind," "I am not a victim of these thoughts").
5.  **Return to the Sangha (Most Important Advice):** The root cause of the struggle is isolation. Dhammarato strongly emphasizes that without **noble friendship** (*kalyāṇamittatā*), one is inevitably influenced by the surrounding worldly environment. He insists the practitioner must reconnect with the community.
    *   He is given a specific contact (Jesus, a knowledgeable Spanish practitioner) to reconnect with.
    *   He is directed to rejoin the online Sangha groups (UK, US, Discord) and engage actively.
6.  **Re-immerse in the Dhamma:** Listen to talks, visit the website, and start talking about Dhamma again to re-align with correct understanding and avoid twisting the practice to fit personal habits.

**Underlying Theme:** Happiness is found by changing the mind's internal dialogue *from within*, but sustaining that correct practice is nearly impossible without the support, reinforcement, and wise guidance of a Sangha. One must consciously choose to be part of the "very small minority" that practices correctly and consistently, rather than being reabsorbed by the unconscious habits of conventional society.

**Outcome:** The practitioner recognizes he has lost adherence to the Dhamma principles and gratefully accepts the advice, committing to reconnect with the Sangha and resume frequent practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speaker (Dhammarato, Speaker B) uses several key metaphors and implied stories to illustrate their advice. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Thoughts as Wild Animals / Running Wild:** The speaker rejects the student's idea that thoughts are "out of control" or "independent," but the very act of correcting this uses the metaphor of taming or managing thoughts. The advice to not let thoughts "run wild" paints a picture of thoughts as untamed creatures that need to be observed and corralled.
2.  **The Victim vs. The Winner:** This is a central contrasting metaphor. The speaker categorizes "unwholesome thoughts" (e.g., "I can't do this," "This is too hard") as **"victim thoughts."** In contrast, the alternative is to have **"winner's thoughts"** (e.g., "I can do this," "I can manage my life according to wisdom"). This frames the mental practice as a battle for agency and success.
3.  **Depth vs. Frequency ("Deep" vs. "Often"):** The student suggests they might be uncovering "deep stuff." The speaker directly reframes this, replacing the metaphor of **depth** (digging into hidden, complex issues) with **frequency** (something happening "over and over" on the surface). The instruction is to "go often" in observation, not "go deep" into analysis.
4.  **Re-absorption into Society / The Environment:** The speaker uses the metaphor of **absorption** or **environmental influence**. By isolating himself, the student has begun to "take on the habits of the people" around him. He is advised to avoid being "reabsorbed into society," which is portrayed as a force that pulls one away from correct practice, likened to being shaped by what the environment "presents to you."
5.  **"Get back in the flow" / "Get back into the Dhamma saddle":** These are metaphors of **movement and return**. "Flow" suggests a current of correct practice one can re-enter. "Saddle" is a riding metaphor, implying the student has gotten off the "horse" of Dhamma practice and needs to get back on to guide it properly.
6.  **"Looking for love in all the wrong places":** This is a **cultural reference** (likely from a popular song) used as a metaphor for the universal human error. People seek happiness (love) externally—in society, school, etc.—instead of in the correct "place": within their own mind through thought transformation.

### **Stories / Implied Narratives:**

1.  **The Story of the Small Minority:** The speaker outlines a **hierarchical story** of practitioners:
    *   Millions hear the teachings.
    *   Most don't practice.
    *   Of those who practice, most practice *wrongly*.
    *   A **very small minority** practices correctly and gains "great fruit."
    This story serves to motivate the student to rejoin that elite, fruitful minority and to explain his struggle as a result of having drifted out of it.
2.  **The Story of Jesus (the friend):** While not a detailed narrative, the mention of **Jesus** serves as a **contrasting story** to the student's own. While the student (Pedro) has been "going to school and feeling bad," Jesus has been actively engaged in the practice community ("Wad hopping" – visiting monasteries). This real-life example provides a model of correct engagement and a tangible connection back to the "Sangha" (community).
3.  **The Cyclical Story of Burnout and Recovery:** The student describes his own **personal story pattern**: intense practice leading to a complete shutdown for days, followed by recovery and starting again. The speaker reframes this not as a necessary cycle but as a failure of moment-to-moment awareness, urging him to interrupt the "3 or 4 days" of shutdown by catching it in "3 or 4 seconds."

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories work together to shift the student's perspective from one of **passive suffering** (being a victim to deep, cyclical, uncontrollable forces) to one of **active, frequent management** (being a winner who often observes surface thoughts, changes his environment/noble friendships, and gets back into the flow of correct practice).
