### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Very, very few people are able to keep their mind in wholesome states. We've got these instincts, you know. Self-preservation instinct brings up fear, and nesting instincts brings up wanting to go along to get along, and territorial instincts brings up racism, otherisms, we're-better-than-they-are comparisons, and all of that kind of stuff. And the procreation instinct brings up our materialism and our clinging to rights, rituals, properties, and all kinds of things. And it all winds up being clinging. So, Zach, you were telling me about a weekend retreat that you had on Zoom, I suppose, online. And so you kind of mentioned that there was more than one teacher. There was several people involved with it. Can you give me some insight into that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there was one main teacher, Henrik, who was running the course, and then we were watching videos and listening to podcasts. I see. As supplemental material each week in preparation for the retreat.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Because you had mentioned monks.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, but they weren't involved with the retreat. It was just their videos were being played. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just old teaching. So there was Buddhadasa talks, like the old recordings where you hear the helicopters in the background and the chickens clucking.

**Speaker A:** There's a really old— Chickens I got, helicopters not a chance.

**Speaker B:** Anyways, there's a cacophony of sound happening in the background. So yeah, we, we like interpreted whatever the sound was as sounding like helicopters because there was so much activity happening in the recording.

**Speaker A:** Ah, I see. Okay. Yes, the likelihood of helicopters is Anagami, though.

**Speaker B:** I'll have to report back to the crew then and let them know that they were mistaken.

**Speaker A:** They were mistaken in the sense that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did not travel, did not travel much at all. There was no reason for him to go anyplace. And so by the time Electron— I mean, he was in Bangkok in the 1930s and '40s and some in the '50s, but after that he didn't go out. So by being at Wat Suwan Mok, we have to understand there's no helipad there. There's no place for— it's all tree line. The only place that they could land a helicopter is on a main highway, and that's not going to happen. Also, there's no reason for having any helicopters there. The only flying machines that are in Thailand belong to the government. There is no civil aviation in Thailand. Okay, I think that closes the book, doesn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's a really interesting series of talks going through all the different stages of Anapanasati and the different tetrads. And I found it was one of the most useful talks in terms of the series of videos that we went through. So I wanted to find out more about the practice. Knowing that you were a student of Buddhadasa.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So we can talk about Anapanasati then. Let us say in a particular context that we have to divide into two groups. One would be organized and the other would be natural. And that the way that some things are taught in an organized way, the students remain in that organized mentality, and it's hard for them to break down out of the boxes. Okay. And that you could see many things are like that. Music. Mathematics, especially mathematics, is done in boxes in the sense that you have numbers, then arithmetic, then pluses and minuses, and then multiplication and division, and then fractions, etc., and one builds on top of the other. But a mathematician doesn't care about those ways that it was taught in the first place, but somehow In meditation practice, people do get caught up in the way that things are taught. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa always taught it in the same way that the Buddha taught it, and the Buddha taught it according to the Satipatthana. But Anapanasati is not necessarily practiced that way. It's taught in an organized way, and then practiced in a natural way. So generally what I do with each individual student when I'm talking about Anapanasati is that I teach it in a more of a natural way and then just kind of plug in the numbers along the way. If we're going to be doing it in an organized way, naturally we start at the beginning, go to the middle, and then to the end. But that beginning, middle, and end is only an organized way of things, rather than the sequence of events in which they should occur. And this is the problem with many of the students: they think that one is more important than the other, than the other. And this is especially true when it happens that step 1 will be taught on day 1, step 2 will be taught on day 2, and step 3 will be taught on day 3. And this kind of thing. Okay, this is very, very much like going to an automobile driving school, and they teach steering on the first day, acceleration on the second day, gear changing on the third day, and now off you go. And you haven't learned about the brakes yet, right? Okay, so this is a way that Anapanasati is often taught so that the students will get confused and stay confused about it. So it's quite possible that because you've already heard me talk about it some, that you're getting a different perspective on it than others who only hear it in the organized way, in the sense of body, feeling, mind, and mind objects. Now, there is also an interesting point in the Pali called "Eka Marga," and basically what this means is "unsure" and "argumentative" in the various translations, and this appears in the Satipatthana Sutta. And what this is translated is, is, uh, oh monks, this is the direct path. And that's possibly the best translation. That's Bhikkhu Bodhisattva's translation. But in the Thai language, it's closer to something else. It's closer to the hypotenuse of a triangle in that, in that regard, a shortcut. Then instead of going from A to B and then B to C, you go from A to C directly. This is what is meant by the shortcut method, and this is also what is meant by Vipassana, or dry insight. And it also can be regarded or called the shortcut method in that the first three triads of Anapanasati are dealt with very lightly and then immediately or quickly jump into the fourth tetrad. The more complete way to do this is to first attain Jhana and then work through the Jhanas to do one by one as they occur, the fourth tetrad. Except that if we do it the shortcut method that has evolved into what is called Vipassana meditation, that means because the mind is not yet free from the hindrances, that it should have been done with the proper practice of Anapanasati, ridding the mind of unwholesome thoughts and putting wholesome thoughts in, which then gets the mind ready for or actually puts it into first Jhana, which is the right place to do it, because now all of the things that are to be observed are all wholesome. The arising and the passing away, the flittering away of each phenomena is phenomena that is wholesome. Whereas if the mind is not completely free from the hindrances, then even if we are doing the noting, even if the noting is the arising and the passing away, we're still watching unwholesome things arise and pass away, right? We really do start living in a junkyard or maybe a garbage pit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it sounds more challenging.

**Speaker A:** It actually is. And this is what's called dry meditation. And this is the kind of stuff that will lead to the dark night of the soul and that kind of thing. And this is also not something that the Buddha recommends. And it is actually doubtful within my own mind as to whether Bhikkhu Buddhadasa recommended that or not. He did mention it and he did talk about it. But he still spends much of the time in the organized way of doing it, and that it's almost like the way that, for instance, Goenka's practice is, is like they never get out of the first tetrad. They go from watching the breathing into body scanning and they get nowhere else.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, certainly in the Goenka stuff that I've listened to, like the recordings that are available, it does appear to be really, really heavy on the first tetrad in terms of those aspects of the breathing, the body scanning.

**Speaker A:** Actually, no, not so much the first tetrad. The way you said it indicates that they give quite a lot of weight to Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4. But in fact, no, they give very little on Step 1, nothing in Step 2, 7 days of Step 3, and nothing about Step 4. That in fact, at the later part of the meditation, they introduce something called strong determination, which goes directly against Step 4. Right.

**Speaker B:** Strong determination sitting, like sitting really, you

**Speaker A:** know, like to— sitting still, not opening your hands, not opening your eyes, not opening your legs, no matter what bodily sensations occur. Because according to Goenka, after all, these are just bodily sensations. All the liking and not liking of them is in the mind. These are just sensations. So there are various techniques of watching pain. Where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's retreats, even today, from the very beginning, even though the retreats got started at Wat Suwan Mokkh by people who had done retreats in other parts of Asia, including Goenka, the sitting style is that people only sit for 30 minutes. And even then, they're not required to sit, that you can stand and even do walking meditation. But in the past few years, to do walking meditation, they ask instead of going to the back of the hall that you actually go outside. But the whole point is, is that things are relaxed much more because the end point is, is that if you're going to develop Sukkha, If you're going to develop contentment, if you're going to develop relaxation, then we have to develop those things directly, not something quite opposite of that. So keeping the body comfortable is part of the practice within, let us say, more of the Asian or the The Thai tradition, as opposed to the Burmese, are really into forcibly long sittings. And yet that's predominant, almost as if that appeals to the Western mentality in the sense— because you actually mentioned that you can sit longer— the answer is, so what? Yeah, yeah. And that's an important question. Why is that a goal? And yet it winds up being quite an ego goal. In some cases, it can actually give students some encouragement. But on more than one retreat on a regular basis, the retreat was planned so that there would be a morning sitting a 15-minute break and another morning sitting followed by lunch, and that I would sit the whole time just to give the students encouragement. And that would happen a lot. But that was many years ago until I figured out that, yeah, it depends upon what I'm encouraging them to do. If I'm encouraging them to sit longer and they can't sit longer, then they're just in pain and I'm not doing them any service at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, certainly, you know, later on in the practice, like, I would say I could sit for 2 hours, and after 2 hours I'd feel like, you know, a lot of discomfort. I'd want to adjust my seat or stand up, stretch, go for a walk, you know, grab a drink of water. Yeah, it was just getting to be uncomfortable for sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay. One of the things that happens with that is that the Satipatthana Sutta becomes the king. And it's easy to see why, because even the Anapanasati Sutta says that Anapanasati practice is for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana. Anapanasati is practiced for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana. That's an interesting point. Right.

**Speaker B:** Fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. That's why the Anapanasati is set up in the format that it is, so that it can be easily understood that it's fulfilling all of the foundations, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And yet, on an individual basis, we can't practice that way. Going back to the story of the driving school that doesn't teach everything, this is very much like in some cases we say, "Well, today I'm going to go to meditation and I'm going to work on body scanning." Another way of saying that is that I'm only going to put the body in the meditation hall, and the mind and the feelings and the Dharma can lay in bed all day. And then the next day I'm going to be sitting and only bring Vedana into the meditation hall, and the body and the mind and the Dharma can take a hike. But in fact, we recognize that's not possible. We've got to work with all four of them, all at this basically not at the same time, but within mind moments of each other. Within a second, things— a lot can happen.

**Speaker B:** That makes so much sense because I feel like even the way that we tackled it, we had like a week on the first tetrad, and then 2 weeks later a week on the second tetrad. And going into lots of detail. And then a week later or two weeks later, like third tetrad. And then even as we were practicing, we were going through and going like, okay, well, I guess for the morning portion, let's see if we can work on the first tetrad. And then in the afternoon, the second tetrad. And tomorrow we'll talk about the third. And maybe at the end, we'll start talking about the fourth tetrad.

**Speaker A:** Well, if there is any fault to be laid in that formal organized way of teaching, it runs right back through Bhikkhu Buddhadasa all the way to the Buddha in the didactic. But I imagine in the experiential, there's actually suttas that talk about it in the experiential way much better. And so the Satipatthana and the Anapanasati Sutta themselves are taught in the organized way. Now there's another way of looking at it. We were talking about dry Vipassana. Let's look at wet Vipassana for a moment. And how wet can it get? OK, so in what we would call that method, this is what the Buddha would recommend. This is what the Anapanasati Sutta was originally set up for, and this is also how the Satipatthana Sutta is laid out if you think about it. But there's also other suttas which directly point at that there is actually a number one task to be done, and it does not start with the breathing, it does not start with step 5 of the feelings, it starts way up there at step 9. And that is Sati, to wake up and investigate the mind. And then step 10 of Anapanasati is to gladden the mind. So we actually, if there's going to be a set starting point, that would be it when we wake up. Another way of saying that, it doesn't matter what skills you have developed, if you can't remember to apply those skills, they're no value to you in that moment. It's only when you can remember to apply the skills. Which then brings back the point then of why— what's the practice of meditation anyway?

**Speaker B:** What is it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what's the point? Is it just to practice to sit long time, 2 hours? I mean, that's the goal.

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, my understanding now would be the practice of meditation would be about developing Samatha, so calm abiding, gladdening the mind so that you can do insight practice.

**Speaker A:** So how can you do those things if you don't remember to do them?

**Speaker B:** Right, you can't.

**Speaker A:** All right, my question was loaded. I had just been talking for several paragraphs on Sati. And then I ask you, what's the most important thing to learn in meditation?

**Speaker B:** Developing Sati, to remember.

**Speaker A:** And the answer to that would be Sati. Exactly. All right. If you can't remember to apply the skills, especially when you need them most. This is why Sati is so important, and Sati is actually tied deeply with Right View. And right effort. In the Eightfold Noble Path, these three run in circle around each other as for development, that the more right effort you put in, the more pure your view will be. Not just ideal effort. You can put in wrong effort, you can put in too much, you can put not enough. Meditation is loaded with all kinds of stuff. But when you're putting in the right effort, the right effort is in fact to purify the view, so that we come out of wrong view into right view. And we remember to do that. And so we remember, and continuously remember, to change our viewpoint from an ordinary view to a noble, high-quality view. And this should be then the basis for the beginning of Anapanasati practice, and then later we'll add that fourth ingredient, but only when the time comes. In the beginning, we have right view being developed as the better and better right view, right effort that gets better and better because the righter it gets, the less effort it is, and Sati is the main one to be developed because we have to remember to spin this circle of Right View, Right Effort, Right Sati, remembering. And so, this is what we bring back to the Anapanasati Sutta, and we get a completely different view of the Anapanasati Sutta that was originally taught in an organized way, according to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And what we recognize here is that all this is the point about investigating the mind to see what's there, gladdening the mind and removing unwholesome thoughts, and remembering to do this over and over again. And that's where Step 10 comes in, of these new thoughts, is gladdening the mind, wholesome. This is also tied then into the breathing. So we can see that basically the sequence of events is step 9, 10, 1.

**Speaker B:** What you just said reminds me of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. The way that you just laid it out was mindfulness, remembering to do investigation, where you're investigating the mind and seeing what's going on. And then Piti, Sukkha, like developing the mind.

**Speaker A:** It seems like— No, no, you left out energy.

**Speaker B:** Oh, energy, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Which is one's right effort.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** The Seven Factors of Enlightenment are nothing more than the fulfillment of the Eightfold Noble Path, and they're done in the proper order. Sati is number one, unremitting Sati on the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. That in fact in the Anapanasati Sutta as well as the Satipatthana Sutta, you will see a description of the seven factors of enlightenment, the sambojhana, and that it says in the Anapanasati Sutta that Anapanasati with the Eightfold Noble Path is practiced for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana, but the Satipatthana is practiced for the fulfillment of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, which is actually then the fulfillment of the original path factors of Sati, Investigation, and Right Effort. But now they become at that level, when we've got them developed, unremitting Sati, unremitting Right View or Investigation, unremitting right effort. But when it's unremitting right effort, then it's really easy. So isn't that interesting? Now, what do we mean by unremitting Sati? Because that's the key. Going back to that original question, why do you meditate? What's the point? If the answer was originally Sati, then this means that unremitting Sati means that it will be there when we need it. It does not go away and hide. It comes back. It keeps coming back, just like pounding on a drum. You keep hitting the drum. Here's an example of that in real life. Notice my hands. This is the head of a drum. This is the drumstick. Okay, this is Sati. Is this the way you play a drum? I don't hear anything. You have to hit it right. This is what we mean by Sati. It's not something that you wake up and you're woke. It's wakey wakey, wakey wakey, one more time, wake up and look, keep looking, keep noticing, be here now, now be here now, now be here now. This is what we mean by unremitting over and over again, so that when you're tooling down the road with proper Sati and the cop stops you with his sirens and his whistle, is this the time to lose Sati? No, it's the time when you need it most. And yet that's the time when most people freak out. We go— when we are in danger, we go back into instincts and we act instinctually. And so we need to not be acting instinctually. We need to act wisely at certain times in our lives, and we need to be awake at that moment. This is why we're practicing this, and this is in fact where we can look at step 1 of Anapanasati. Go back and read that in the sutta, and it says, "With Sati, we take a long, deep in-breath." Now, because it's translated as "mindfully," it just says he's mindfully breathing in and out, and that just takes all of the power and weight out of it.

**Speaker B:** Am I wrong in assuming a connection between Vitakka and the the drum, like that applied attention, is that part of what we're talking about here, like that continuous application of Sati?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Okay, yes, applied and sustained thought. We do want to apply the mind to wholesome and sustain it there, which means we have to remember to sustain it. It's almost like we're experimenting with how to get mud to stick to a side of a building. We're building an adobe building and all we've got is thatchwork. Mud, right? If you just take that mud and gently apply it to the thatch, it's going to fall down. But if you take it and you whap it in there, almost like standing back at a distance and throwing it like a baseball, and within a foot it hits that wall, it's going to stick. Okay, so we want to apply the mind in a way that it sticks. The Sati gets really strong, and we apply that with every in-breath, and then we apply it with every out-breath to remember that this is a long, deep in-breath. And so we talk to ourselves about this breath: 'Wow, this is such a good breath!' And as I breathe out, 'I relax, I relax.' And so we bring that mindfulness attention in there to build that Sati as a skill. And then we use that Sati with every one of the 16 aspects of Anapanasati. It does in fact say, I'm building Sukkha, for instance, step 5. I'm building Sukkha while I'm mindfully breathing in and mindfully breathing out.

**Speaker B:** So, I mean, I feel like mindful gets so many different uses.

**Speaker A:** I know. An Arhat just sent me a graph of the use of the word mindfulness in world literature for the past nearly 200 years, I think starting in 1800. And it was zero, flat zero until the 1970s and it started to bip. And then in the 1980s, and it's taken an upward curve. Yeah, it was almost like a vine that crawled along the ground until it got a tree, and then it crawled straight up the tree. That's the word mindfulness in English language. It was nonexistent until Buddhism came by, and now that word is all over the place and nobody has a clear definition of it because it's such a rarely used word. And guess what? It does not fit.

**Speaker B:** Or Sati. Yeah, when I think of Sati as the root, like Smirti, like to remember, or it's closely related. So to remember to do this, to remember to wake up, like you said, wakey wakey. But when I think about mindfulness, in the way that we typically use it, it would be like, I guess, present moment awareness might be like just aware of what's happening in the present moment or aware of what you're doing while you're doing it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're right. And not only that, but it brings in an additional connotation that needs worthy of investigation in this sense. That what you're pointing at is being aware of this present moment looks, sounds, tastes, and smells like passive, right? And if it walks like passive, quacks like passive, it's passive. Okay, the Anapanasati, however, is a very active meditation. It's not passive at all. It's directly involved with playing developing skills. It's the difference between listening to your favorite piece of music played on the piano, on a gramophone, versus sitting down to the piano and playing it yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it takes skill and concentration.

**Speaker A:** And precisely, it's the same thing then as with video games. You can watch somebody play a video game over the shoulder and get into the game, but you're easily distracted. Yeah. And you're not even watching all the nuances. You're not watching every mouse movement that's happened. That basically your eyes are trying to chase down what he just did. So watching a game and somebody else is playing it is always looking at it in the past. You can't be up there. But when you're doing the game, you got to click that mouse and then something happens. As opposed to something happens and I saw it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, play the game, don't watch the game, in a sense, right?

**Speaker A:** So this is what we call having skin in the game. Anapanasati, you got to have some skin in the game. What skin? Your whole body. That what skin?

**Speaker B:** Skin in the game.

**Speaker A:** You got to get in the game, which means this is an active meditation, which means we have to actively get involved with throwing those unwholesome thoughts out and gladdening the mind and taking deep breaths and actually talk to ourselves about our breathing, because we're not at the stage yet, nor are we even trying to make the mind quiet. Whether the mind is noisy. The question is, is it noisy or is it music? Mostly it's noisy, mostly it's comparison, mostly it's tritones, mostly it's critical thinking.

**Speaker B:** Dissonance.

**Speaker A:** Dissonance. Is it this or is it that? Good, better, and best. Tall building, taller building, skyscraper, world champion. Everything is in competition like that. All right, that's critical thinking as opposed to nurturing building. Oh, that's a nice building. Hey, that one's a nice one too. Oh, I like that one. Wow, that one's tall. But there's no comparisons. It's just this is what it is. The buildings are not comparing themselves. That's only done in the human mind. And when we stop comparing the size of buildings, we start comparing the size of our egos with each other, or how long we sit, or all kinds of stuff like that. And we do so ignorantly, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, certainly that comparison can arise. Like, if I'm sitting there and I go, oh, this guy just sat for 3 hours and I only did 2, or whatever. He must be really advanced. And I mean, I'm like, in some respects he is, but the comparison that we're getting into now of better, worse, you know, levels and stages, I feel like

**Speaker A:** if he is advanced, he's not thinking about I'm advanced.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** He's just grooving. Yeah. And the reason you're not advanced is because you're not grooving. Your comparison— you're comparing you to him. Yes, exactly. This is what we could look at then, is these are the unwholesome thoughts that prevent us from being in that state of Sukkha. But we could talk ourselves into it. By giving ourselves wholesome thoughts. And so this is the value then of that gladdening of the mind, because that means that the body is being controlled by the mind with the breathing slowing down. And now we're beginning to control the feelings, letting them slow down too by giving them nurturing thoughts, nurturing points. Everything's all right, everything is fine, and we can finally relax. And that's when the body relaxes. The body is not going to relax until the feelings relax, and the feelings are not going to relax until the mind relaxes. And the mind relaxes when it's removing the unwholesome thoughts. So basically what we meant right there was then from Step 10, now down to Step 5, now down to Step— excuse me, Step 6, now down to Step before, that the relaxation of the body, that in fact in many, many places the first Jhana is referred to with 5 factors, but in some Jhanas there's a 6th factor that fits in with the Anapanasati Sutta very well, and that is that part of the first Jhana is that the body relaxes also, the body is not going to be uptight, when the feelings are really good, you're actually going to feel relaxed. And that relaxation does come with that long out-breath. It's almost a relaxing breath. So in this regard, we're talking about now body, feelings, mind— body, feelings, mind— getting the mind pure, free from unwholesome thoughts, talking ourselves into feeling really good, getting the body relaxed. And that will be then what we call the first Jhana. That means that now the mind is fit for work, according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. The mind is fit for work and ready to do the fourth tetrad. Right. As opposed to, forget about getting the mind and the body and the feelings all relaxed and purified and everything, just take your hindrances and jump right into that chest pool. That's the drive of Vipassana. Never mind doing anything about getting the body relaxed, never mind about how bad you feel, and never mind about scatterbrained you are. Just go do the fourth tetrad. That's the drive of Vipassana. That's the Mahasi Method. No, no, no, no, no.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I've, I read through the, the Practical Insight manual, but I haven't— like, I would say my main practice is having more of a balance of Samatha and Vipassana, as opposed to noting everything throughout the day.

**Speaker A:** Actually, before we go into the fourth tetrad, which we could cover in depth on another day, but let's talk about that. In the suttas, there was never a distinction between Vipassana and Samatha. In fact, the word Samatha only very rarely appears, and also the word Vipassana only very rarely appears until later literature. And in fact, some of the later literature is taking the right approach. In the sense that when it does come up in the Anguttara Nikaya, because that's the place where Samatha and Vipassana are actually first addressed, which seems to have been 50 to 100 years after the Buddha's death. But in the— and I can give you— I can go back and do the research because at one time I did. I came up with about 5 or 6, maybe 7 suttas that were all pointing at the same point. And that is stop making a distinction between Samatha and Vipassana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're yoked together in the sense

**Speaker A:** of— They go precisely together. One of the sutras says that if you have one, you develop the other. If you have the other, you develop this one. If you don't have this one or the other, then develop them both.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, like, experientially, that makes sense in a sense, because you're calming down the mind. The mind is getting very clear, very sharp, where you are able to see things very, very quickly in that sense. And almost like the emptiness of thought becomes very apparent, or images, or or whatever appears because the mind is so bright and clear in that place. And then the more that you're seeing that brightness and clarity, the more calm you get, or the more they feed into each other.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. It's a feedback loop. An example of that is look at the way that film photography and cameras have done over the many, many years. When they were first developed, when they first started using them back in the 1860s, the film was not very good, so you had to keep the lens open a long time, which meant that the camera itself had to be very, very stable. But as film got better, we could increase the shutter speed, but the camera still had to be held stable. Now, fast forward to a video that we saw when somebody had a cell phone or a video camera and watched the World Trade Center come down, and you can see it coming. And then all of a sudden, the camera is all over the place because the person felt more about their own safety than they did about doing the filming. And that happens regularly. But it's a point in time when the stability of the camera just gets shocked. And that's what we recognize. Well, wait a minute, the human mind is often like that, that we can't see things clearly because the mind itself is agitated. It's like you got to settle a camera down and get it long enough so that you could take a picture without it being blurred, right? So this is an analogy that you could use to understand why it's so valuable to be able to get the mind, let us say, not completely still, but at least still enough so that we could see things. And one of that is that analogy that I would use. You probably heard the analogy called the monkey mind, where the mind is just jumping freely from one subject to the next, to the next, to the next. And sometimes it gets really ground in on something. And stays stuck on it and won't let it go. So, it would be like the workman who is doing a task, and then the lunch whistle blows, and it's time for lunch. And his buddy says, "Come on, let's go!" And he goes out and he's eating his sandwich, but he's not eating his sandwich, he's not thinking about his sandwich; the sandwich is going in his mouth, But he's eating what he was working on and he can't get it out of his mind. All right, this is also an aspect of the monkey mind, is that it will not go even where we want it to go because it goes wherever because it's not trained. So now what we're going to do is we're going to say that we're going to put it in a corral. We're going to put up a fence, maybe like a firebreak. Or something to start corralling the mind, because we can't stop it, we can't make it stay still, but we can at least keep it out of dangerous, unwholesome places. And so we start to corral the mind, we put— we fence it in, we put it into a box so that they can't just leap off to the other side of the world or the universe, or all of a sudden start thinking about Donald Trump. Because the mind's like that, it'll just jump all over the place. And so we could say, no, we're going to stay fixed. An example, by the way, that happened recently with a new student, because we're talking about the practice of how to handle the right here now, and he says, well, if I did that, I'd never get out of bed. And I said, you know, but I answered this question, but I answered— because I answered this question, I answered it wrongly. I should have just said to him, listen, get back to the point. We're not talking about every minute of your whole life. We're talking about how to start handling this present moment, right? Okay, but the mind will jump way off into the future. I'll never get out of bed if I had a pleasant thought when I woke up. He doesn't know that. So this is the— I just— to

**Speaker B:** that point, I feel like, you know, if I had a pleasant thought when I woke up I wouldn't want to distract myself and jump to, you know, the phone right away, or worrying or ruminating on something, or not wanting to get out of bed because I'm worried about the workday.

**Speaker A:** Well, you see, you've made that change of connection. You're changing your point of view from I got to get the work done into Wait a minute, we don't have to be working all the time. And when those people hear, wait a minute, you don't have to work all the time, that means, well, I'll never get anything done because I have to work all the time in order to get anything done. But all of those kind of thoughts are unwholesome, you see. And so we need to find out what thoughts are wholesome so that we can begin to corral them, to get them down to just being wholesome. That requires actually a tremendous control over one's mind. Very, very few people are able to keep their mind in wholesome states. We've got these instincts, you know. Self-preservation instinct brings up fear, and nesting instincts brings up wanting to go along to get along, and territorial instincts brings up racism, otherisms, we're better than they are, comparisons and all of that kind of stuff. And the procreation instinct brings up our materialism and our clinging to rights, ritual properties, and all kinds of things. And it all winds up being clinging— clinging to my tribe, clinging to my nest, clinging to my physical possessions, and clinging to me. The four modes of clinging. And these are the four natural instincts, and we need to overcome them, and we need to overcome them with wisdom, and we need to overcome them often.

**Speaker B:** So the four instincts— so you said the clinging to me, the clinging to tribe, the clinging to the nesting instinct, and what was the last one?

**Speaker A:** Material possessions. Like men cling to women as material possessions— trophy wives, big houses, fancy automobiles, bank accounts.

**Speaker B:** Definitely.

**Speaker A:** So those are instinctual,

**Speaker B:** right? Yeah, that— I mean, that is the habit. Like, I feel like If I watch the mind, that feels like the dependent origination, the Paticcasamuppada of like, oh, like this is pleasant, I'm going to go after it. Like you're whipped around by the pleasant, unpleasant, and it's all happening instinctually. Like the more that I watch it, the more that I'm like, oh, the only reason I'm doing this is because it feels good, or the only reason I'm avoiding this is it feels bad.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's the kind of investigation that is best done when the mind is pure. That's the kind of investigation that you and I will talk about next time—the actual operation of what to do when the mind is fit for work. What work are we going to put it to? But for right now, the main job is twofold. Using the skills of the Eightfold Noble Path, the first skill is to get oneself into that pleasant state quickly and easily. And then the second skill to be developed is to be able to maintain that by guarding the thoughts to make sure that they're wholesome. One wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. And so that's the first goal. That's the first goal that in fact the Buddha talked about in this, uh, number 111, one by one as they occur, uh, where the Buddha talks about Sati— excuse me, Sariputta. And the first thing that it says after they're giving him praise and whatnot like that, it says, quite secluded from sensual desire, quite secluded from unwholesome states, period. That's how the whole show starts. And yet Western meditators haven't even gotten to that point yet. They can't get to step 1 because they're trying to jump on to step 10.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, certainly. I feel like the jump to wanting higher states or higher attainments is like, it's such a carrot, right? If you're, or at least it's a carrot for the hardcore kind of, I don't know, the, or the Dharma practitioners that are like, yeah, we're We're hardcore Dharma. We're all about becoming Arahants or

**Speaker A:** attaining

**Speaker B:** all 8 Jhanas backwards, forwards, skip a few.

**Speaker A:** But they can't get first Jhana until they get all the unwholesome thoughts. That's one of the primary points. And you're not going to get anywhere Anapanasati in the sense of the Four Tetrads, until we get somewhere with the First, Second, and Third Tetrads. And when we get somewhere with the First, Second, and Third Tetrads, what that means is, First Jhana, so that we can do the Four Tetrads. Or another kind of optional thing is to say, "Well, wait a minute, you can't really purify the mind without doing a little bit of the Four Tetrads anyway," and I'll say, okay, okay, I give you that, that we do mix all four of them. But for those who forget the first three and go for only the fourth, they're not going to get anywhere because all they've got to look at is the arising and falling of hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I know that we've talked about this, the, the fourth tetrad, but once the mind is in first jhana. Quick rundown of the fourth tetrad. It would be watching the arising and passing away of wholesome thoughts. So seeing Anicca, seeing the flux, the flow, impermanence of the wholesome thoughts as opposed to unwholesome with the dry insight. We're doing wet insight now.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's one of them. I got it. Fading out, that would be the arising and fading away of thoughts, one wholesome thought after another. That's the applied and sustained thought, right? Because I said it that way, I could say, well, what are some of the other factors that are worth looking at when we're in first Jhana? The answer is other of the first Jhana factors, like how is my Sukkha? How is my Piti? How is the mind free from hindrances? Okay, and then we can look at, well, how did we get here? And the answer to that is the Eightfold Noble Path. Or now that we're here, what are the factors of enlightenment? How is my Sati? How is my view? How is my effort? And so we start investigating that. Now, when I say 'how is,' that just is an indication of start asking questions, start noticing, start looking at it one by one as they occur. Means that you're not doing this in set order, like, 'Oh, I'm going to watch Sati for a while,' but rather they come up and down and up and down and up and down in a split second. And so we need to watch the arising and the passing away of these things, and, and in a way, we can see the stream or the flow, and we can see these things happening in there. We can see that we're taking a little effort. We can see that we're taking— I'll throw that unwholesome thought out. We can see the right view. Oh yes, that's wholesome. Yes, that's not wholesome. So this is how we do the investigation, is we investigate the Jhana factors, then we investigate the skills that we use. And then the last thing on the list is the list of how does the mind itself work now that the mind is in really wholesome state. In that regard, what we're doing is we're saying, well, we're only going to be looking at basically the first half of the Paticcasamuppada, because the second half is all about how the mind ignorantly winds up in Dukkha. And since we're not ignorantly winding up in Dukkha, there's nothing to see here, folks, move along.

**Speaker B:** So the first half all the way up to clinging, or to— no, no,

**Speaker A:** up to feelings, because you're completely in control of your feelings now. You could feel the way you want to wisely. So now we're going to investigate the feelings themselves as how they are associated with perception and how feelings arise. And pass away, knowing that these are all good feelings that are arising and passing away.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that clarifies hugely. That's a huge one for me, of the— you can feel the way you want to wisely, because if you can control the feelings, then you can control the whole back end of Paticcasamuppada and avoid all the unwholesome nonsense that you get into.

**Speaker A:** And for me, I think— Precisely, that's the teaching of the Buddha. This is why Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says wisdom at the point of contact, folks. That's where it is, right? Because then you're in complete control of the feelings.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. I mean, that's what I meant the other day when I was saying that that's like the sort of the weak link in there, or the wisdom at the point of contact so that you don't go into the feeling. But I mean, now I feel like I understand that at least intellectually. Like I can see, I'm like, right, like if you, if you have Piti and Sukkha and you're in control of feeling positive, wholesome thoughts, then you don't have to get completely tossed around by the Paticcasamuppada game.

**Speaker A:** Great, excellent. Well, we'll leave with that insight then.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** This has been a great talk, and we'll continue on with the Four Tetrad next time.

**Speaker B:** Yes, let's.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. See you later, Zach.

**Speaker B:** Take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friend Zach (Speaker B), is a rich exploration of **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and the pitfalls of modern meditation approaches. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: "Dry" vs. "Wet" Vipassana**
Dhammarato critiques the popular "dry insight" or "dry Vipassana" approach (e.g., Mahasi noting, Goenka body scanning). This method often jumps straight to observing phenomena (the "fourth tetrad") without first purifying the mind. The result is observing the arising and passing away of **unwholesome states** (hindrances), which is likened to "living in a junkyard" and can lead to difficult experiences like the "dark night of the soul."

The Buddha's recommended path is **"wet Vipassana"**—insight done with a mind already bathed in **Samatha (calm, purity, and joy)**. This requires first establishing a wholesome, joyful mind as the foundation for clear insight.

### **The Correct Sequence: Building the Foundation First**
The heart of the teaching is that one must **first attain a wholesome, joyful state (First Jhana)** before doing serious insight work. This is done through the natural sequence of **Anapanasati**, not just its organized, step-by-step presentation.

1.  **Start with the Mind (Steps 9 & 10):** The real entry point is **Step 9 (investigating the mind)** and **Step 10 (gladdening/steadying the mind)**. One must actively remove unwholesome thoughts and nurture wholesome ones.
2.  **Develop Sati (Mindfulness) as an Active Skill:** Sati is not passive "present-moment awareness." It is an **active, drum-beat-like remembering** to apply skillful means—to wake up, over and over. It's the crucial link between Right View and Right Effort.
3.  **Integrate Body & Feelings (Steps 1-8):** With a gladdened mind, one then works on calming the body with the breath (Steps 1-4) and cultivating joyful feelings (Steps 5-8). This creates a **feedback loop**: a pure mind leads to joyful feelings, which relax the body, which further calms the mind.
4.  **The Result: First Jhana ("Mind Fit for Work"):** This integrated process results in a mind free from hindrances, filled with wholesome thoughts, joy (Piti), happiness (Sukkha), and a relaxed body. **This is First Jhana**—the proper foundation for insight.

### **Wet Insight: Observing the Wholesome**
Once in this "wet," purified, joyful state (Jhana), one then practices the fourth tetrad (Steps 13-16). Here, one observes the **arising and passing away of *wholesome* phenomena**—the Jhana factors, the factors of enlightenment, and the skillful mental processes. This is the true, liberating insight into impermanence, not the observation of mental garbage.

### **Key Critiques and Analogies**
*   **Organized vs. Natural Teaching:** Teaching Anapanasati rigidly, tetrad-by-tetrad over days, is like a driving school teaching steering on day one and brakes on day four—it's disjointed and ineffective. The practice must be integrated naturally.
*   **The "Shortcut" Fallacy:** The so-called "direct path" (Eka Magga) of dry Vipassana is a shortcut that bypasses essential purification, making the path harder.
*   **Marathon Sitting is Not a Goal:** Forcing long, painful sits is counterproductive and often an ego goal. Comfort and relaxation are essential for developing true Sukkha (happiness).
*   **Instincts are the Enemy:** Our primal instincts (self-preservation/fear, nesting/conformity, territorial/racism, procreation/materialism) constantly generate unwholesome thoughts and the **Four Kinds of Clinging**. The practice is to overcome these with wisdom.
*   **Wisdom at the Point of Contact:** The ultimate aim is **controlling feelings with wisdom** at the moment sense contact occurs. This breaks the downstream chain of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada) that leads to suffering. A gladdened mind is not at the mercy of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a call to return to the Buddha's integrated path, where **Samatha and Vipassana are "yoked together."** The priority is to actively use mindfulness (Sati) to cultivate a joyful, purified mind through wholesome thinking and relaxed breathing. From that foundation of **First Jhana**, true insight into the nature of wholesome mental states naturally unfolds, leading to liberation. The next discussion is promised to detail the actual investigation of the "fourth tetrad" from within this wholesome state.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain meditation concepts and common pitfalls. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors & Analogies**

**a) The Driving School Metaphor**  
Used to criticize overly structured, step-by-step teaching of *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing).  
> *“This is very, very much like going to an automobile driving school, and they teach steering on the first day, acceleration on the second day, gear changing on the third day, and now off you go. And you haven't learned about the brakes yet.”*  
**Purpose:** To show that meditation taught in rigid stages can leave practitioners unprepared and confused.

**b) The Drum Metaphor**  
Illustrates the active, repeated effort required for *Sati* (mindfulness).  
> *“Notice my hands. This is the head of a drum. This is the drumstick… This is what we mean by Sati. It's not something that you wake up and you're woke. It's wakey wakey, wakey wakey, one more time…”*  
**Purpose:** To emphasize that mindfulness is a skill built through continuous, deliberate application, not a passive state.

**c) The Mud-on-a-Wall Metaphor**  
Explains how to make wholesome thoughts “stick” in the mind.  
> *“It's almost like we're experimenting with how to get mud to stick to a side of a building… if you just take that mud and gently apply it to the thatch, it's going to fall down. But if you take it and you whap it in there… it's going to stick.”*  
**Purpose:** To describe the vigorous, intentional effort needed to cultivate and sustain wholesome mental states.

**d) The Camera Stability Analogy**  
Compares a calm mind to a steady camera, and agitation to shaky footage.  
> *“Well, wait a minute, the human mind is often like that, that we can't see things clearly because the mind itself is agitated. It's like you got to settle a camera down… so that you could take a picture without it being blurred.”*  
**Purpose:** To show why *samatha* (calm) is necessary for clear insight (*vipassana*).

**e) The Monkey Mind & Corral Metaphor**  
Describes the untrained mind and how to train it.  
> *“We're going to put it in a corral. We're going to put up a fence… we start to corral the mind, we put—we fence it in, we put it into a box so that they can't just leap off to the other side of the world…”*  
**Purpose:** To explain the initial stage of meditation as limiting mental wandering and confining attention to wholesome territory.

**f) The Video Game Metaphor**  
Distinguishes between passive awareness and active meditation.  
> *“It's the difference between listening to your favorite piece of music… versus sitting down to the piano and playing it yourself.”*  
> *“Watching a game and somebody else is playing it is always looking at it in the past… But when you're doing the game, you got to click that mouse.”*  
**Purpose:** To argue that true *Anapanasati* is an **active, skill-based practice** (“having skin in the game”), not passive observation.

**g) The “Wet” vs. “Dry” Vipassana Metaphor**  
- **Dry Vipassana:** Trying to gain insight with an unprepared, hindered mind (like jumping into a “chest pool” of junk).  
- **Wet Vipassana:** Developing calm, gladness, and purity first, so insight observes wholesome states arising and passing.  
**Purpose:** To contrast a forced, painful approach with the Buddha’s recommended path of cultivating joy and calm before deep insight.

**h) The Hypotenuse / Shortcut Metaphor**  
Refers to *Eka Magga* (“direct path”) as a shortcut, like the hypotenuse of a triangle.  
> *“Instead of going from A to B and then B to C, you go from A to C directly.”*  
**Purpose:** To describe methods (like some dry insight practices) that skip foundational calm and purity.

---

### **2. Stories & Anecdotes**

**a) The Helicopter in Buddhadasa’s Recording**  
A humorous, minor story where students mistakenly thought they heard helicopters in an old recording of Buddhadasa’s talk. Speaker A explains why that was impossible (no helipads, no civil aviation in that area).  
**Purpose:** Lightens the conversation, but also illustrates how students can misinterpret experiences.

**b) The Student Who Said “I’d Never Get Out of Bed”**  
A story about a new student who misunderstood “staying in the present moment” as meaning he’d never get out of bed if he focused on pleasant feelings.  
**Purpose:** To show how the untrained mind jumps to irrational future projections, missing the point of working wisely with the present.

**c) The World Trade Center Camera Shake Story**  
A reference to 9/11 footage where the camera becomes shaky as the photographer panics.  
**Purpose:** To illustrate how agitation (fear, instinct) destroys stability and clarity, both in filming and in meditation.

**d) The Lunch Whistle & Sandwich Anecdote**  
Describes a worker so mentally absorbed in his task that he can’t enjoy his lunch—his mind is still “eating” his work.  
**Purpose:** To exemplify how the “monkey mind” can be stuck, not just wandering.

---

### **3. Recurring Conceptual Frameworks Used Figuratively**

- **Four Instincts → Four Clingings:** Links human instincts (self-preservation, nesting, territorial, procreation) to the four types of clinging (to sense pleasure, views, rites/rituals, self).  
- **First Jhana as “Mind Fit for Work”:** Treats the first meditative absorption not as a goal, but as a **workshop** where the mind is purified, calm, and ready for insight.  
- **“Skin in the Game”:** Borrowed from finance, used to mean full personal engagement in the meditation process.

---

### **Overall Purpose of These Metaphors & Stories:**
They make abstract meditation concepts tangible, warn against common misinterpretations (especially in Western mindfulness culture), and advocate for an **active, joyful, integrated practice** that combines calm (*samatha*) and insight (*vipassana*) from the start. The speaker consistently emphasizes that meditation is about **skillful mental action**, not passive observation.
