### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All of a sudden it got very noisy. Can you turn your sound down just a little bit? Very noisy, including your—

**Speaker B:** tap the microphone or something.

**Speaker A:** How about that? It's okay now. It's okay. All right, so you had asked a question concerning the fact that you became, or that you noticed that you had become jealous of someone that you had no reason really to be jealous of. You don't even know him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's very interesting. We can, we can talk about jealousy as the outcome of a fetter. That in fact, the 5 lower fetters are talked about in the Suttas several times. They're mentioned, we know what they are, that the first 3 fetters are dissolved by knowledge, and that is the knowledge of personality view, the knowledge of rights, rules, and rituals, and how we keep telling ourselves to do stuff. That we don't want to do. And then eventually the doubt is erased, in the sense of doubt about what is and what is not the path, doubt about who's got to tread the path, and doubt as to whether you can in fact tread that path and get the benefit out of it. Once we get through those doubts and that you're completely secure, now is the time to actually start in earnest to actually remove the defilements. And yet most people, before they have this noble view and the eradication of these three defilements, they only know Dukkha enough to where they think that, "Oh, I should not be angry," or, "I should not be this." And so what they do is they take sensuality or greed or desire and ill will that is just part of the Eightfold Noble Path mixed with ignorance. And so the Eightfold Noble Path actually— excuse me, the Second Noble Truth. So the Second Noble Truth is greed, ill will, and ignorance. And the way that the Buddha talks about it is, is that if we can eradicate the ignorance, then we can eradicate the underlying tendencies for greed and ill will. But if we really don't understand what we're doing, then greed and ill will would be difficult to deal with. So when we begin to peel back the greed and the ill will, because we have right noble view, as we discover what this greed and ill will— which is, by the way, the third and the fourth fetter Once we start to pull those back, we begin to get down to the deeper stuff, which is the higher fetters. Now, the higher fetters are not really discussed very often. They're kind of mentioned both in the Abhidhamma, and they're also mentioned in the Samyutta Nikaya. And the funny part about it is, is that they have two different lists. And, and that the reason that the lists are different is because in the Abhidhamma they go down to not what the fetter is, but the result of the fetter. Now, in the suttas, in the Samyutta Nikaya, we're talking about that fetter is the fetter of conceit, or the fetter of manu is the Pali word for it. Now, what that conceit means is that if you compare yourself to another person, If we do so, we're also doing it critically, that we cannot nurture someone or have nurturing feelings for someone when we're in competition with them. That instead, that competition that we have with them is based upon greed and ill-will, and a certain level of ignorance. And when we start to uncover the greed and the ill will, we'll begin to understand that this Panna will actually fall into one of two places. If I compare myself to another person, one possibility is that I win, and then I have pride. And if I compare myself to another person and I lose, then I have either jealousy or envy. Okay, and let's describe what's the distinction between jealousy and envy. Jealousy is when you're jealous of someone who has the same thing that you do, and it may be better. But envy is when they've got something that you don't have at all. Okay, so example is the girl sees the boy, the girl sees the boy that she wants with another girl and she becomes envious. But if she goes and makes connection with that boy, then the original girlfriend is going to experience jealousy. Jealousy has more ill will in it.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yes. How dare you come take what I have? Okay. Rather than the envy is the more greed. I want what you have. But they're both examples of the outcome of comparing ourselves to other people. And this is very insidious in the sense that it does create Dukkha. There are actually two kinds of Dukkha: the Dukkha of pride, and then the Dukkha of envy and jealousy. And if we are able to come out of our comparing mind, out of the critical mind, into the nurturing mind for ourselves, in our normal practice. In other words, if we're practicing Anapanasati correctly, then we will come out of, in the moment, out of any desire to make ourselves better or any desire to criticize ourselves and just allow us to be as we are, nurtured. And everything is okay, everything is all right. And so, we gladden the mind and get ourselves into a state of Sukkha, right? And the place to do this easiest is in seclusion, when we get away from the world, we get away from the screen, we get away from other people, we get away from it all, and then we can begin to deal with the fact that I'm still not happy, because I still, not only am I secluded from all the stuff that made me unhappy, I didn't get really secluded from it because I brought it in with me. So now I have to recognize I'm not going to deal with that stuff that I brought in here that's causing me all the suffering and all the woes and whatnot, that I'm actually going to practice being okay, practice being satisfied, practice being secure and safe. And comfortable, because when we're in seclusion, we are safe, secure, and comfortable. There really are no alligators on the floor, so you might as well go ahead and feel safe now. And so we need to practice how we feel so that we can get ourselves into feeling the way that we want to feel, and then we can learn to deal with the outside world. So, if you had been in that bar feeling secure and comfortable and happy and satisfied and saw someone come in, you wouldn't have had to compare yourself with them. You were already in a way of pre-programming in the sense of, "Things are not really as good off as I would like it to be," and now this guy walks in and that proves it to you. Except that you don't even know him. You really don't even know how much trouble he's seen, or how much trouble he gives himself. All we know right now is that we're hassling ourselves, we're comparing ourselves to someone else, because already we didn't feel secure, so naturally it's going to be the easier thing to do is to compare ourselves to someone else and fail at that comparison, and then we feel jealous and envy, because you've already set him up as something to compare yourself against. Naturally, he's going to win. It takes a different kind of setup in the sense of when you recognize that your practice, your Dharma practice, has now given skills, that you've got the skills you need. And the skills that you need are the skills of being happy and secure and content. And also the skills that follow along with that is that if you are happy, secure, and content, then you don't want to hurt anyone to get something. You don't want to steal things that you don't really want all that much. And so our Sila becomes quite nice, quite beautiful. And now, if we haven't finished with all of that stuff, after we really do have ourselves on top, now we can go out and start comparing ourselves to others. And this time we win every time until we get tired of the winning, because we recognize that every time that I'm comparing myself against somebody, that I'm actually putting myself in a position to lose. And if I don't compare myself to anybody, then we're both okay. And if I start to compare myself with another person, that already means by comparison that I'm actually being critical of us both. And if I can come out of that and be nurturing, then I can be nurturing to myself, and then I might even be able to hold a conversation with this guy. In a nurturing way. Hi, how are you doing? Glad to see you. And so, we change that whole meditation practice out of the normal ways of living into nurturing, to have nurturing thoughts, to say you really are okay. You're so okay, you don't even have to compare yourself with others to check out to see if you are okay or not. You already are. And so this is how we lead into correct practice, and the important point is here on the Eightfold Noble Method or Path is right effort. We have to actually take the effort to throw unwholesome thoughts, thoughts of comparison ourselves to others, thoughts of good and bad, right and wrong, up and down, and change that into wholesome thoughts, wholesome thoughts that would be nourishing. The wholesome thought of everything's okay, everything is fine, no problems. And if you had been able to remember to do that when you were sitting in that bar and saw that guy walk in, you can say, hey, everything's all right, what a handsome fellow he is. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, feelings were pretty strong as that situation arose.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Vedana. Right, and so that's why we want to practice. This is in fact a good example of Murphy's Law.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Have we talked about Murphy's Law?

**Speaker B:** The worst possible thing happening at the least convenient time, is that right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. And now that point has actually revolutionized engineering back in the 1960s, completely revolutionized engineering, because in those days they expected everything to go wrong. An example of that was tubes. You remember that before we had transistors, we had tubes, tube-type radios?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, okay, I've seen pictures of them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you've seen pictures of them. Yeah, they're that antique, aren't they? But back in those days, we had to change the tubes often because we expect the tubes to fail. With more modern stuff, we expect the computers to not fail, which means that when they do, we feel bad because we expect them to not fail. In the old days of radio with tubes, we always kept a bunch of tubes extra so that when things failed, we could repair it easily. And this is where Murphy's Law comes in, because if you're going to send a satellite up, you can't fix it up there. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it's going to go wrong at the worst possible moment. We need to plan on that. We did take that into consideration. Okay, okay. And there's many examples of that. One would be that if you had a brand new hotel that had 1,000 rooms and you had a brand new fancy computer system that was rated that this software And this hardware would handle 1,000 rooms. Okay, when is that computer system going to fail?

**Speaker B:** I've heard you say you remember

**Speaker A:** its

**Speaker B:** first— yeah, its first busiest night, was it?

**Speaker A:** Right, the first time. Well, actually, it'll probably wait until the hotel is absolutely full. Yeah, and the computer has reached its capacity, and that's when it will fail. Hmm. Okay, if we know that, then we can know that, hey, I'm going to walk into a bar. That's a dangerous place. Things can go south in my own mind in a hurry. Let me be on guard when I go into a bar because that's a dangerous place, and things are likely, like my own mind, to jump. So, we begin to think about what is it that can get set up so that we in fact can go into a place where things fail. And what do I mean by this? Well, if we get ourselves to the place where we can feel all right and everything is fine and everything is marvelous, then what is it that's going to bring us out of that back into our original ordinary mind? Of suffering, of Dukkha, of anxiety, of tension, of comparing and losing. If we haven't practiced well, then that's going to happen really easy. But if we practice in seclusion to get ourselves to the point that we can handle anything in seclusion, now we're getting ready to where we can go out in the world and handle anything in the world Because we can handle our own mind in seclusion, because when we go out into the world, guess what? There the mind is. That in fact there was nothing but mind anyway, and that the only thing that the world is doing is just providing new input. But the world that you live in is in fact the world of one's own mind. And that we know all about that from the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, in the sense that when we see an object with the eyes, in order to make sense out of it, we have to turmoil or mull it over a little bit. We have to perceive it, or we have to understand what it is. And so in that regard, there's two kinds of seeing. I can see the object, and then later I can say, "I see what you mean." And when I say, "I see what you mean," that's a different level— and the Pali word for that is the "saliyatana." The saliyatana means the internal representation of that which we brought in from the outside, that we actually don't live in the real world, we live in a constructed world of understanding. If we lived in the actual real world and only in the real world, then we would be completely ignorant of what was happening in the real world; all we have is sensory input. But because we can take that sensory input and put it in with all of our old past to make sense out of it. For instance, if I see that object, I can name it as tree because I've seen trees before. And so this is what I'm getting at, is that we don't really live in the real world anyway. We live in a world that is immediately constructed out of parts of the real world and our past. Right? So, if we can continuously then practice on just living in the real world, in the sense of 'be here now,' live in sensory input, and spend less and less time in our past, then we are most likely going to perceive things the way that they really are, rather than perceive things and see them the way they used to be, because we're remembering how it used to be. And so you are actually, and have been before, in the habit of comparing yourself to other people. And so that's what was there, was the past, that you actually in a way weren't comparing yourself to this guy in, in that room at that particular moment. You were bringing in a bunch of old stuff in the past. You are in fact inventing things about him and then comparing those things with your own past, rather than comparing you with him that you see right in the moment with who you are right in this present moment. You brought the past in for doing that comparison. And if we can keep track of that, wait a minute, I don't have to bring the past in to understand the present, I can just allow the present to be the wow that it actually is right now. Okay, and so you could have actually seen that guy and says, wow, look at him, and that would have been the end of it. But in fact, you had to dig up the past to figure out who you were, and then you invented some stuff about him, and now you're comparing, um, half-failures with imaginary successes that he's got. I mean, after all, he's got a drop-dead gorgeous babe with him, so she must think he's quite marvelous, therefore he must be quite marvelous, you see. This is how we do it, and so we compare ourselves to others and we invariably wind up feeling bad. This is one of the high fetters. Where does that come from? Basically, where it comes from is of fear. The number one feeling that all humans have is the feeling of fear, and that feeling of fear is actually the language of that part of the mind, of that part of the brain, which is referred to in scientific circles as the self-preservation instinct. So when you came in to see that guy, in a very, very tiny way, you allowed his, the perception of him, to intimidate you just a little bit. A little bit of fear comes in. Just a tiny little bit of fear to come in, and we don't recognize that. If we had been practicing Anapanasati really, really well, then as soon as that fear comes, "Aha, I see you fear, out you go, and I'm really good to go right now." Let me take a deep breath and I'm okay. All right. And so then if we can just be okay in the moment, we can actually make friends with this guy rather than comparing ourselves to him.

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, he was, he was like at the opposite end of the bar, but you know, I don't think I would have ever gone out of my way to— who knows, who knows.

**Speaker A:** Well, you certainly went out of the way to feel bad about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I

**Speaker A:** guess. Yeah, so knowing that we can feel bad just by looking at someone, I mean, those feelings will pop up that fast, that we will make that kind of connection sometimes very quickly, winding up feeling bad when in fact there's no reason to feel bad at all. Whether that guy walked into the bar or not is absolutely irrelevant to how you would feel if you were in fact able to control or manage your feelings. And so that's really what we're practicing with Anapanasati, is talk yourself into feeling the way you want to feel, rather than feeling afraid and then having to go and compare yourself with this guy and all of that kind of stuff that wound up in a full-blown Dukkha. Where you're unhappy and dissatisfied, and there's no reason for us to feel that way, other than the fact that that's our habit. And so we're in the habit of winding up comparing ourselves to things, or to want something that somebody else has had, or everything like that, and we wind up feeling bad for no reason at all. That you would have felt better, in fact, if he hadn't even walked into the room. The fact is, he walked into the room with that Thai girl, and because he walked into the room with that Thai girl, you used that as an opportunity.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, actually, actually, it unfolded. It unfolded. There was first— first he walked into the bar, and I was astounded by appearances. And then I looked closer And I noticed, then I noticed the girl, and then I compared myself to that as well on top of that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And by doing that comparison, we rob ourselves of our joy. That's why this mana or this comparison or this competition is a very subtle better. It's very, very subtle, so be on guard for that, so that the next time you can say, "Wait a minute, I don't have to do that. I don't have to feel that way. I can feel the way that I want to."

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Okay, thank you very much, Dhammarato. I have to go now.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, practice well. Remember, you can feel just the way you want to feel if you practice doing that. Okay, thank you. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Good afternoon.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a student's (Speaker B) experience of feeling jealous upon seeing a handsome stranger with a beautiful woman in a bar. Using this real-life example, Dhammarato provides a detailed lesson on the nature of jealousy, its roots in Buddhist psychology, and the practical path to overcoming it.

Here is a structured summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: The Fetter of Conceit (Māna)**
The jealousy experienced is identified as an outcome of a "higher fetter" called *māna* (conceit or comparison). This is the ingrained habit of measuring ourselves against others, which always leads to **dukkha** (suffering, dissatisfaction).

*   **Pride:** If we compare and see ourselves as "better," we feel pride.
*   **Jealousy/Envy:** If we compare and see ourselves as "worse," we feel jealousy (wanting to keep what we have from others) or envy (wanting what others have).
*   Both are rooted in **greed** (lobha) and **ill-will** (dosa), fueled by **ignorance** (avijjā).

### **The Practical Path: Cultivating a Nurturing Mind**
Dhammarato emphasizes that intellectual understanding isn't enough; we must train the mind through practice.

1.  **Start in Seclusion:** Begin your practice away from triggers (like a bar). In a safe, quiet place, learn to make yourself feel **happy, secure, content, and okay** just as you are. This is the foundation.
2.  **Practice Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) Correctly:** Use the breath to anchor yourself in the present moment, letting go of self-criticism and the desire to be "better." Gladden and nurture the mind until it settles into **sukkha** (happiness, ease).
3.  **Apply Right Effort:** Consciously **abandon unwholesome thoughts** of comparison, competition, and criticism. **Cultivate wholesome thoughts** of nurturing, safety, and "everything is okay."
4.  **Take the Trained Mind into the World:** Once you can reliably stabilize your mind in seclusion, you can enter challenging situations. The goal is to meet the world from a place of inner contentment, so you no longer need to compare yourself to others to feel okay.
    *   **Example:** From a place of inner security, you could have seen the man in the bar and simply thought, "What a handsome fellow," without it triggering a negative self-story.

### **Key Insights and Analogies**
*   **Murphy's Law:** Apply it to your mind. If you go into a "dangerous" place (like a bar, or any triggering situation) with an untrained mind, it *will* go wrong. Practice beforehand so you're prepared.
*   **We Live in a Constructed World:** We don't experience the raw "real world." We mix sensory input with memories and past habits to create our perceived reality. Your jealousy wasn't about the *actual* stranger, but about a story you created by comparing your past self to an imagined version of him.
*   **The Root is Fear:** The initial trigger for comparison is often a tiny, unnoticed flicker of **fear** or intimidation (a self-preservation instinct). A well-trained mind spots this micro-fear immediately and releases it with a breath, returning to "okay."
*   **The Robbery of Joy:** The act of comparison itself robs you of present-moment joy and contentment. Freedom comes from dropping the comparing mind.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a practical guide for transforming jealousy. The solution is not to analyze the other person, but to **build unwavering inner well-being through meditation (seclusion practice)** and then **protect that well-being with mindful awareness (right effort) in daily life.** The ultimate aim is to replace the critical, comparing mind with a nurturing one—for yourself and others.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and the psychology of jealousy. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Fetters as Chains or Knots:** This is a core Buddhist metaphor. The "lower fetters" and "higher fetters" are described as bonds that tie us to suffering (Dukkha). The process of "peeling back" or "dissolving" these fetters is like untying knots or breaking chains that bind the mind.

2.  **The Comparing Mind vs. The Nurturing Mind:** This is a central contrasting metaphor.
    *   **Comparing Mind:** Described as a "critical" mind that sets up competitions, leading to winning (pride) or losing (jealousy/envy). It's portrayed as a source of internal strife.
    *   **Nurturing Mind:** Described as a mind that offers safety and acceptance, telling oneself "everything is okay." It's likened to a safe space where one can "gladden the mind" and achieve contentment (Sukkha).

3.  **Bringing the World Inside:** The idea that when we go into seclusion, we don't leave our problems behind because we "brought it in with me." This metaphor illustrates how our mental habits and past conditioning travel with us.

4.  **The Constructed World:** The explanation of how we don't live in the "real world" but in a "constructed world of understanding" built from sensory input and past memories. This is compared to seeing a tree and naming it based on past experience.

5.  **The Alligator on the Floor:** A simple, vivid metaphor for irrational fear: "There really are no alligators on the floor, so you might as well go ahead and feel safe now." It's used to emphasize that in seclusion, the dangers are often self-created.

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **The Bar Scenario (Listener's Story):** The entire talk is framed around the listener's real-life story of feeling jealous upon seeing an attractive, successful-looking man with a woman in a bar. This personal anecdote is the foundational example used to explore all the concepts.

2.  **Jealousy vs. Envy (The Girl/Boy Example):** A clear, relatable story to distinguish the two:
    *   **Envy (Greed-based):** A girl sees a boy she wants with another girl and becomes envious ("I want what you have").
    *   **Jealousy (Ill-will-based):** If that girl gets the boy, the original girlfriend experiences jealousy ("How dare you take what I have?").

3.  **Murphy's Law & Engineering:** An extended analogy from engineering history.
    *   **Old Tube Radios:** Used to illustrate an expectation of failure (having spare tubes ready). This is likened to the old, suffering mind that expects things to go wrong.
    *   **Modern Computers/Satellites:** Used to illustrate how we now expect things *not* to fail, and how catastrophic failure happens at the worst moment (e.g., a hotel booking system failing on the busiest night). The moral is: we must plan for mental failure. Just as engineers plan for satellite failures, we should go into challenging situations (like a bar) "on guard" because "things can go south in my own mind in a hurry."

4.  **The Practice of Seclusion as a Safe Lab:** The process of going into seclusion to practice feeling safe, secure, and content is presented as a training ground. It's where you learn to "handle your own mind" in a controlled environment before going out into the more stimulating "world," which is just a provider of "new input" for the same mind.

**In summary,** the talk uses the **listener's personal story of jealousy in a bar** as the central case study. It explains this experience through the **metaphor of fetters** and the **critical comparing mind**. The **engineering story of Murphy's Law** serves as a practical warning about mental habits, while the **jealousy/envy love triangle story** clarifies emotional distinctions. The overarching goal, illustrated by the **metaphor of the nurturing mind** and the **safe lab of seclusion**, is to replace comparison with self-nurturing and intentional cultivation of wholesome feelings.
