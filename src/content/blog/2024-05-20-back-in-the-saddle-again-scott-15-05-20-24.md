### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Scott, go ahead and ask your question again.

**Speaker B:** Okay, my question was about Kamma, specifically the Kamma of my individual life. And I was asking if all of the events and the actions that occur in my life is in a sense predetermined by Kamma. So cause and effect, the Kamma of my life.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's kind of like Hindu way of thinking of it, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of Kamma actually means the word action. All right. And the question that you have is actually concerning the results of action. So, the question then becomes, well, when did the action occur? And the act— and the answer to that is always in the past, no matter how far back you go, right? And that the point of it is, is that our actions from the past create a habit, okay? That in fact it goes in this way. That our thoughts and our feelings create the way that we're going to be speaking, and the way that we talk and think is going to then determine our actions, and our actions then are going to determine our habits, and our habits determine our destiny. And that's basically the question that you're asking. You're not asking about Kamma, you're asking about destiny.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, pretty much.

**Speaker A:** Well, the destiny then can be of two kinds. There can be the kind that is ignorant, which is the way that it is with almost all people, and then it can be a destiny that is based on wisdom, which means you've got some choice in it. And that ordinary people don't know that they have a choice. That in fact, there's a whole lot of talking, mostly from religions— Hindu, Islam, Christianity, and probably 100 others— all begin to talk about things that happened a long time ago, like original sin. That in fact, if you think about it the way that Christians talk, the original sin means that you were broken. From the very beginning, that everybody was broken right from the very beginning. There was the original sin, and now you're born broken. And that's basically what you've got the eye on, is that you're, you're broken from birth, and that, um, uh, some of the brokenness that you had in the past also affects that brokenness at birth. And the point is that if we begin to see our actions, we will have some control over them. And the way that we can begin to control our actions is going all the way back to looking at our thoughts, looking at our feelings, watching our speech, and that will then help us be able to control our actions. Which will then reform the habits and give yourself a new destiny. Your choice. Now, there's a lot of examples of that. One of them is very clear, is the one— I think this is Shakespearean— he who lives by the sword dies by the sword. You've heard that?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now, what that actually means is, is that a guy in his teens and 20s can get really good good at being a swordsman. But if he keeps carrying that sword and using that sword into his 50s and 60s, there's going to be some young buck that's going to come by and cut him in half. Someday that swordsman has to put down that sword, or somebody's going to use it, or another one on him. The same thing with gunslingers in the West. The same thing happens with title fighters. Look at the example of what happened with Muhammad Ali. He won the world title, it was taken away from him because he wouldn't go to war. Funny thing, the guy's a fighter and he wouldn't go fight for the U.S. Army, so they put him in prison, took his title away. He came back and got his title again. Then the second time, I think it was George Floyd who took it away from him, and then he got the title again. But by then he had already been knocked himself crazy with all the head blows that he's got. Now he's got— if he's still alive, I don't know if he's still alive or not— but in his later years he was completely crippled.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, Citta.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. So that's a clear example of he who lives by the boxing gloves gets clobbered, right?

**Speaker B:** Even if you're the best.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, even if you're the very best, you're still going to get clobbered if you keep going. Sometime or another, we got to hang up the gloves, put down the sword. And we have a choice about that, if we know we have a choice. In fact, there's an article, I think it's in The Lion's Roar by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, it's actually on our website. And the title of it is, "Kamma: The Choice is Yours." All of the religions, as I was saying, teach that once you've gone into it, you've got a destiny now and you can't change your destiny. There's also a bunch of stories about that. One of them is an interesting Islamic story to where the guy had a dream that he was going to die. And then he was in the marketplace and he saw Death riding on a horse. And he says, I'm getting out of here. And so he got on his horse and he rode and he rode as fast and as hard as he could for a long, long, long time. And he finally— the horse was exhausted, he was exhausted. He saw a tree and he went and sat under that tree. And guess what? Death came around from the back of the tree and says, I saw you in town today, and I was wondering how you were going to get here, because your destiny was to get killed under this tree. Okay, so that story is saying that in fact we don't have any choice, that if we are destined to die, we're going to die no matter what. Now that's actually very religious. It's very stupid. It's very Hindu, is very Islamic, and it's very, very Christian. That in fact, when I was a child, I moved into— with my family moved me into Charlotte, North Carolina, and that's when I came across words like Providence. Why? Because there was Providence Road. They named all the roads in Charlotte, North Carolina after things that don't exist, okay? There was a Destiny Road, there was a Providence Road. All of this stuff is trying to teach people that they don't really have a choice. And the fact is, is that you do have a choice. One of the ways that we can look at that choice is that if you can see that, let us say, the boxing or the sword is negative Kamma, or that it's actually stated as that a dark action gives dark results. But if you start having bright action and bright action and bright action and bright action, it's actually going to overpower the old dark action that you had before. It's not a matter of repenting in the sense of 'I'm sorry.' The matter is repenting in the sense— and what the word actually means is to turn around and go off in the other direction. So let's say that you've had— you're going down the road in the wrong way and you're headed straight for a cliff, and then you see that cliff in front of you. If you turn around and go back in the other direction you're unlikely to fall off that cliff. But you were destined to fall off that cliff in your own stupidity and ignorance because you were heading right for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the whole story then. And I've given you several different examples of this with the guy under the tree, boxing gloves, Swords, it's all the same, is that whatever habits we have, those will determine our destiny because we still do the same thing habitually, right? I can't— for a clip, unless we reform, unless we repent, right? And the 60-year-old who just got cut but didn't get killed with the sword He recognizes he's got to put it down. He hangs that katana up on the wall. He's Japanese. And he survives because he repented. He reformed. He didn't get killed with the sword because he put it away. He changed his behavior. He repented. So, this is the way that we look at it. Now, we can repent and reform from all of our bad actions, through Anapanasati, through the teachings of the Buddha. Why? Because as I said before, that all of our bad habits that give us a destiny, are determined by our action. And our actions will start to change if we change the way that we talk and think. So changing the way that we think will change our destiny. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I come into this, uh, right view and everything feels like I'm— like I— like I'm on top of it. Like I gotta control over it, like everything makes sense, you know. My experience is I'm just, you know, just breathing, seeing, feeling, hearing, and it's a relief. Now, at some point, I fall out of it, and I don't know quite when, and then I don't know really what went wrong. And then all of a sudden I'm in a big pile of Dukkha again.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact, have you heard about people when they're lost in the woods, they go around in circles?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so let's use that cliff example. Let's say that that cliff that you were about to run off actually was in a place that was wooded. It wasn't a desert that had a cliff, it was a wooded place.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that there was a creek or a river at the bottom of that cliff, but it was very dangerous to go off that cliff. Now let's say that you saw that cliff and you turned around and went in the other direction, but if you get lost again, you'll probably be going around in circles. And guess what? You're going to go right back over that cliff again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** 'Cause you're not watching, you don't know where you are, you're lost. This is why Anapanasati is so valuable in the sense that you gotta keep repeating it. So that story or the analogy is actually, we can apply that to that we can have good wholesome thoughts and start to build the habit And then something will happen and we'll get lost again. We'll go back into our old habits again. And the question is, can you wake up from that and stop being lost? Because if you're lost, you'll go start around in circles and you go right back into your destiny again. You go right back into the old habits that you had. Why? Because you go back into the old actions. Why is that? Because you go off into the old speech patterns and the old thought patterns and the old feelings. So we have to keep practicing. It's very much— here's an example. This is an example that's happened to me specifically. I used to be a pianist. I used to be able to play. I had a pretty decent, you know, I had some Chopin and I had some popular tunes, I had Beethoven. Guess what? I can't play one of those pieces anymore. Why? Because I stopped practicing. So I started off as a child and not a musician. I practiced and I trained for years and became a musician. But along came Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in Thailand and the Dhamma, and I broke the guitar in India and haven't hardly seen a piano since then. They don't have pianos at Watts, they don't have pianos in Thai homes. They had pianos in most American homes in the 1950s. But not being around a piano, I have not played the piano. I remember sitting down at the piano in the 1980s, when I was in the United States, and I had hardly lost it then. Within 20 years, I had lost it. And so, let us say 10 years ago or so, we bought an electric piano for Kitty, And I was as lost on it as she was, because then it had been 50 years since I'd played the piano— not 50, but 40. So if piano does that, how about your thinking process, that if you don't continue to practice Anapanasati, it's actually going to go back to the old childhood ways of doing things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I'll have success in the practice, and then after the success, I'll— I tend to think, okay, I got it now.

**Speaker A:** And then you don't practice anymore, and then you don't go back and get lost again, start going in circles again, and then the old destiny comes back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if you keep practicing having a new destiny, then you can create the new destiny. In fact, that's a very good point that you're making, because I don't know of any students who don't fall into that trap. They practice Anapanasati, get great value out of it, and say, 'Wow, this stuff is really, really good. I am so glad that I've been practicing, but now that I've got it, I don't have to practice anymore.' And so they quit practice. I've done that too. And when we quit practice, slowly, slowly, the old habits come back again. And then we wake up to recognize, 'Wait a minute, all those good new habits that I had been practicing have gone. So there's another way of talking about it. You've seen at the park, they have swings. Sometimes they have good swings that are hung by a tree, and there's a river or a pond out there, and you swing way out and then jump, turn loose of the rope to get into the water. Okay, well, let's go back to the swing that's in the park. And the man's daughter says, I want you to push me, Daddy. And so when she sits down in that swing, gravity's got it. It's down. It's not going back and forth. And so when Daddy starts to push, it's hard to push, especially if he's got a big daughter. It's hard to get that swing started, but if Daddy keeps pushing it and every time it comes back he pushes again, pretty soon he can get that swing going, right? Which is exactly what we're talking about with Anapanasati. We can get that swing going, we can start changing it from being dead in the water or dead still into having a life that really swings. But if Daddy takes a hike, if he goes and sits down to watch his daughter swing, guess what's going to happen? The swing is going to get slower and slower and closer and closer, and it's going to stop again. And then the daughter says, "Daddy, come push me again." And when the Daddy goes back to push, he says, "Wait a minute, this is hard work. I thought originally when I stopped pushing you, you were going just fine. Swinging, pushing you along was really easy." easy. But now it's going to take work again. It's going to take more right effort to get it going again. But once you get it going, then the effort becomes easier and easier. But it's going to only stay easy if you keep pushing. You gotta keep that swing going. You gotta keep bringing back to having, intentionally having those happy, wholesome thoughts. Because if we stop watching the mind, it's going to start spinning off into the direction that it was before we ever started practicing again, and you can lose it all. That nothing is permanent, everything is temporary, and it'll go back to being dead still again. Broken, back to the destiny. But you can start pushing again. You start changing those thoughts, you start changing the way you feel, you start changing your speech pattern, you can start changing your actions again, and that's going to start changing those habits, which is eventually then going to change the destiny. It's a really simple kind of concept, but it's kind of hard to do. It's kind of like threading a needle. Everybody knows exactly how to thread a needle, but not a lot of people can actually do it. But those who practice threading those needles, like seamstresses, they can do it in a flash. They know exactly how to do it, they're practiced or trained, and so they can thread that needle easy enough. But if that seamstress goes 10 years without, or even 5 years without threading any needles, then the next time she tries to thread a needle, it's going to be hard. So this is why it's such a good idea But it goes against the grain, because we get that point of, "Oh, I've got it!" And you know something? Me spending time with students on the internet keeps me threading that needle. This is one of the values of being teaching the Dhamma, because if you're out there teaching the Dhamma, teaching people how to thread those needles, You can still do it.

**Speaker B:** Can you help me with the grief of the unwholesome thoughts? I had it and I lost it, and now I'm damned. Kind of like, it's like I had it and I lost it, and I'm.

**Speaker A:** And then the thought comes, never mind, start again. That's why you called me.

**Speaker B:** That's why.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, never mind, start again, Scott. You did it once, you can do it again. In fact, because you've got some old skills that are rusty, you could dust them off, polish them up, and get those skills back again. Easy, but you got to practice. Just like if I had a piano, if a brand new piano showed up right here, if I started to practice, I could play Chopin again. Probably learn it pretty fast, faster than it took me the first time. Just like Muhammad Ali, he spent time in prison, but when he went back to boxing, he didn't have to start all over again. Yeah, he was really rusty, couldn't do it, but what did he do? He started training, he started practicing again. The next thing you know, he's got the world title again. So get off of your grief, get off your doubt, get off of your poor me, and say, I did it, I can do it again. Let me start looking at these thoughts. One of the thoughts to look at is that thought of, oh, poor me, I lost it. And start having the thought of, hey, I can get it back again easy enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, this is good, makes sense. Now I was wondering if you could walk me through, okay, here I am practicing, okay, never mind, start again, right view. Um, now what to do about, like, let's say, uh, there's like a tension.

**Speaker A:** There's like, I see that tension. Aha, I see that. Wow, I'm really glad I can see that tension. Now I can take a deep breath and just relax that tension away. But if you start to hate that tension, it's going to get worse. I don't like tension, makes it worse. But with that newfound attitude, that skill of attention, I can handle tension. If I can see it, I can do something about it. And what happens with you is you see it and then you feel bad. You don't do anything about it. Oh, poor me, I'm so tense and uptight, and I used to be really carefree. Oh, poor me. So if you can see yourself getting yourself into a pity party and say, hot dog, I see that. I see that I got myself into a pity party because I saw the tension, and I didn't do anything about the tension, but I'm surely going to do something about this pity party I'm having about the tension. I can come out of that pity party, and I can come out of that tension, and everything's going to be hunky-dory again. You can do this. You know you can. You just want to have a pout.

**Speaker B:** If I'm doing meditation, does it matter if my eyes are open or closed?

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** If my eyes.

**Speaker A:** Are open because you're not using your eyes anyway. You're looking at what's in your mind, and that doesn't require your eyes opened or closed.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah. So if my eyes are open, um, like, should I not— you've got your.

**Speaker A:** Eyes closed, you might walk into a tree.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, is it a problem to focus on like something? Like, should I like soften my gaze, so to speak?

**Speaker A:** Like I said, it really doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Right. What matters is, can you see that you're having an unwholesome thought and change it? Soften the thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Because I'll have like thoughts. It's kind of weird. I'll be like, oh, should I look at you? Should I look at me in the little corner? Or should I look at the whole room? And then I'll just kind of like jump around, and then I'll look at myself, and then okay, I'll think about me. Oh, then I'll start thinking, oh, what do I look like right now? How am I being perceived? And then that's like But it's not.

**Speaker A:** You, it's just an image. You don't have to own that image. You can see this image and that image is just an image. We have been taught to look in the mirror and say, that's me, right? And it's not. At best, it's a backwards thing, kind of thing. It's not you at all. It's just an image, and you really don't know what you look like. Here's an interesting example of that.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, can a camera that can take pictures of all kinds of things— can the camera take a picture of itself?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** No. Can a camera take a picture of an image of itself in a mirror? Yes, but that's not the camera. It's a backward image of the camera. So a camera cannot take a photo of itself. But the camera can be handy for taking pictures of all kinds of things. And so use your eyes wisely and don't look at images of yourself and say, "That's me." You can look at that image and say, I don't have to look at that image.

**Speaker B:** This is really good. This is like, it's really clicking for me right now. That's an unwholesome thought I tend to do, is look at images and think it's me. Also, I'm somewhat addicted to social media, see who, oh, who, like, what's the response, like, who liked my post, you know, what do people think about me? Oh, like, I'm not getting enough likes, or like, people must hate me, or like just thinking about all this shit.

**Speaker A:** That's the problem with social media. People have ruined their lives with social media.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** A really good example would have been that Elon Musk would have been better off if he had not bought Twitter. He would have been much better off. He's greatly hated because he bought Twitter and screwed that up. Another one was Donald Trump would have been a whole lot better off if he hadn't been on social media.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but like the deeper problem, like let's say there's no social media, it's like the same unwholesome thought like, oh, that person, they gave me a weird look. Like, what am I?

**Speaker A:** But he didn't give you He didn't give you a weird look, he just gave a weird look, and you're the one who called it a weird look. Yeah, so you made two mistakes. One is that you saw him looking, you called it weird, and then you thought it was you he was looking at.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So yeah, you see like some sort of facial expression and then you feel, you feel like that sense of— No.

**Speaker A:** You can say, aha, I see that.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** This is the time to practice because your old habit is to say weird. Your old habit is to say he's looking weird at me. That's just an old habit. You've been doing that since you were a child.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So can you see that? And say, "Aha, I see that I'm saying that he's weird, and I see that I say that he's looking at me, or he doesn't even know me." The real Scott inside is hard to find. You can't even find him. How do you expect that guy with the weird looking can see your real you? He can't do it. All he's seeing is what he thinks of you, and that's his thought. So if he's having a whole bunch of unwholesome thoughts, he's just going to see you and then start having more unwholesome thoughts. And it really doesn't have anything to do with you. That's his destiny. So don't buy his destiny. Don't buy yours. So you can have the thoughts of hot dog, I can handle his weird looks. Or change the word from weird looks to funny looks, and then you can laugh. Haha, he's got a funny look, he looks funny.

**Speaker B:** What about gossip? Like if someone tells you about gossip about you, like they heard that, like people are talking, like words, you know, you have like a, like I have sort of like a reputation in a sense, like a reputation. Oh, Scott's the guy that always does, gets angry, or like he's He's like, like, this is what people expect.

**Speaker A:** You're projecting that onto other people. You're putting in your head that they have you in their head. So don't give other people any mind at all. You pay attention to your own mind. You pay attention to your own anger rather than projecting your anger on them to project back at you. That's double projection. Remember that the Buddha said in Sutta number 22, along in the same paragraph that he says is that I only teach one thing, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Nirodha, he says that when anyone reviles him, or whenever, anytime anyone reveres him, on that account there is no elation or dejection of heart. The people can revile him and it doesn't bother him. They can praise him, doesn't bother him. Why? Because basically he's been there and done that. What about— get praised? Remember that you were praised when you were a teenager. Why can't you get over that? You've already been praised. Praise be unto Scott. And then when you were young, you were also reviled, and people, uh, put you down and talked to you down, and you were able to survive that back then. So you can survive it now. You've been there, done that. You've had both sides of it. You've been praised and you've been reviled.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you survived. So when you have thoughts about being praised and reviled, you can say to yourself, I can handle that. Nothing to it. Been there, done that. And when they're praising or reviling, they're not praising or reviling you. They're praising and reviling whatever is inside their own head.

**Speaker B:** What about if you get reviled for something that kind of hits— it hits you harder because— don't stand there and.

**Speaker A:** Be a target to let it hit you. Stand out of the way.

**Speaker B:** That, you know, was like is like something that you're trying to work on, or like something that— yeah, then you.

**Speaker A:** Can say, thank you, I'm glad you see that. I see it too.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Stop making enemies of those people out there. Stop making enemies of yourself. Whatever happens is absolutely okay, whether you're praised for it or reviled for it. And in fact, when I was a monk in the United States, I could see that very, very clearly. I'd say something and the Buddhists would say, 'Yay, he got to his Christians!' And the Christians would say, 'I'm going to get you, you're crazy!' Right? So they were just coming out of their own perspective. And neither one of them were able to see me clearly. They were only seeing what they believed. So stop making yourself a target for people out there. Recognize that they don't see you at all. So why should you buy into their crap?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the irony is most of the time it's not people out there, it's literally making myself a target of my own mind.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. So that's what I'm getting at.

**Speaker B:** Nobody else is here right now, but I'm still making myself a target. Yeah. Or I'm not doing that right now, but I'm seeing the pattern. Yeah, the habit of it. In retrospect.

**Speaker A:** So when you see that in the present moment, you can say, aha, I see that old habit. I'm glad I can see it, because if I see it, I have a choice about it. I can be free from it. So see those thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I feel good right now. This is great. I feel like a million bucks. Yeah, great.

**Speaker A:** So go practice feeling like a million bucks. You know what a million bucks feels like? It's all green and wrinkled.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I heard someone give the example. Okay, let's say you won $1 billion, but the catch is you only have 1 day left to live with the billion dollars. Would you take it? And people would say no, heck no. So your life is worth $1 billion, or like just being alive, just being alive is worth more than $1 billion. Yeah, because you wouldn't take it if it meant you're going to die in a day. So I like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, how about $10 billion for 10 days?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, still not.

**Speaker A:** No. Oh, no.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, that's the answer, that like happiness can never come from something, like getting something.

**Speaker A:** But you only— you keep— you, you.

**Speaker B:** Forget, you delude yourself into thinking, I— oh, now, oh, I need that thing now. Oh, shiny thing.

**Speaker A:** Or, oh, I want their praise. I need them to like me.

**Speaker B:** Suddenly your happiness that was already there is gone because now you want something else. Yeah, you want some praise, you want— yeah, this is so— I mean, I know this sounds so obvious, but like to like actually feel it, you know what I mean? Like, but I mean, of course everyone knows, oh yeah, desire, it creates Dukkha, but to see it in your mind, you know. That's what you're helping me do, so thank you. Thank you. Now I'm just talking out loud.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay. Well, why don't we finish now and you go continue to talk out loud to yourself. You keep praising yourself. You're already okay. You don't need anybody else to tell you you're okay. They don't even have the language to say that. They don't have the wisdom to see how good you are, but you do. You really want to be alive. You like it.

**Speaker B:** But now, like, I feel like they're just the smallest amount of fear, like, oh, when Papa Dhammarato ends the call, you know, because it's so easy where you're walking me through it, you know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** You can walk yourself through it. You've done that before.

**Speaker B:** I have, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you've done it before, so you can remember, oh, I've done this before. This is not the first time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, I will. I'll keep doing it.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named Scott (Speaker B), centers on overcoming a sense of predetermined destiny and regaining control through mindful practice. Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Teaching: You Shape Your Destiny Through Present Actions**
*   **Kamma as Action, Not Fixed Fate:** The discussion clarifies that *kamma* means intentional **action**, not a predetermined script. Your destiny is shaped by habits formed from past actions, but it is not unchangeable.
*   **The Habit Chain:** Destiny is formed by a chain: **Thoughts & Feelings → Speech & Thinking → Actions → Habits → Destiny**. The key to change is to intervene at the beginning of this chain.
*   **The Power of Choice:** Unlike fatalistic religious views, the Buddha's teaching emphasizes you have a **choice**. By changing your thoughts, you can change your actions, reform habits, and create a new destiny. This is true "repentance"—turning around and going a new direction.

### **Key Analogies & Examples:**
1.  **The Swordsman/Boxer:** "He who lives by the sword dies by the sword." Even the best must eventually put down their weapon (i.e., unwholesome habits) or face the consequences. Choosing to "hang up the sword" is an act of wisdom that changes one's destiny.
2.  **The Cliff:** If you are ignorantly heading for a cliff (suffering), seeing the danger allows you to turn around. But if you get lost (stop practicing), you may circle back to the same cliff. Continuous awareness is necessary.
3.  **The Swing:** Getting the swing of wholesome mind states (via meditation) requires consistent "pushes" (effort). If you stop (neglect practice), the swing slows and stops. Restarting requires effort again, but is easier once momentum rebuilds.
4.  **The Piano/Muscle Memory:** Skills like playing piano fade without practice. Similarly, wholesome mental habits require **continuous practice** (like threading a needle) to maintain. Success can lead to complacency ("I've got it"), which is a trap.

### **Practical Guidance for the Student:**
*   **On Losing the Way:** When you fall back into old patterns and dukkha (suffering), the instruction is simple: **"Never mind, start again."** Don't grieve the loss; the skill can be relearned faster. Replace "poor me" with "I did it before, I can do it again."
*   **On Handling Distress:** When tension or unwholesome thoughts arise:
    *   **See it clearly:** "Aha, I see that tension/thought."
    *   **Respond skillfully:** Relax, breathe, don't hate it. If you fall into a "pity party" about the tension, see that too and let it go.
*   **On Meditation Technique:** It doesn't matter if eyes are open or closed. The crucial point is **seeing the quality of your thoughts** and skillfully changing unwholesome ones.
*   **On Social Anxiety & Self-Image:**
    *   You are not the image others see (or the image you have of yourself), just as a camera cannot photograph its true self.
    *   When you perceive a "weird look" or gossip, recognize the double projection: you label their look and assume it's about *you*. In reality, people react from their own minds. Don't "buy" their destiny or make their thoughts your target.
    *   As the Buddha taught, be unmoved by both praise and blame. You've experienced both before and survived.

### **Conclusion: The Path Forward**
*   **The real enemy is your own habitual mind,** making itself a target. The moment you see a habitual unwholesome thought pattern, you have the choice to be free from it.
*   **Happiness is not external.** It cannot be found in praise, likes, or wealth. Desire for these makes existing happiness vanish.
*   **The solution is continuous, personal practice.** You must be your own guide, using the tools you've learned. The teacher's role is to help you remember and return to the practice. The encouragement is to **keep practicing, keep connecting with the Sangha (Dhamma friends), and keep "threading the needle"** of skillful mindfulness.

**In essence:** Your destiny is not fixed. Through the continuous, mindful practice of watching and skillfully shaping your thoughts in the present moment, you can break old habit cycles and create a path of wisdom and freedom. The talk is a compassionate reminder that falling is part of the process, and the only response is to gently begin again.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (A) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the concepts of karma, habit, destiny, and meditation practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Road and the Cliff:** Represents a life heading toward danger (suffering, unwholesome destiny) due to ignorance. "Turning around" is the metaphor for repentance (changing direction) and reforming habits to avoid the predestined fall.
2.  **Threading a Needle:** Represents the skill of meditation (Anapanasati) and maintaining right view. It's simple to understand but requires practice to do well. If you stop practicing (threading needles), you lose the skill.
3.  **The Swing:** Represents the momentum of practice. Starting the swing (establishing a new habit) takes great effort. Once it's going (the habit is formed), it's easier to maintain, but if you stop pushing (stop practicing), it slows down and stops, requiring hard work to restart.
4.  **The Camera:** Represents the self. A camera cannot take a true picture of itself, only a backward image in a mirror. This illustrates that our self-image is not our true self, just a mental construct we shouldn't cling to.
5.  **Rusty Skills / Dusting Off Skills:** Represents the ability to return to meditation practice after a lapse. The foundational skill is still there but needs to be polished through practice again (like a pianist returning to the piano or Muhammad Ali returning to boxing).

### **Stories and Analogies:**

1.  **"He who lives by the sword dies by the sword":** Used to illustrate how habits create destiny. The swordsman or gunslinger who doesn't put down his weapon will eventually meet a violent end. This parallels how unwholesome mental habits lead to suffering. The speaker extends this to **Muhammad Ali**, showing that even the best boxer, by continuing the habit, suffers the long-term consequences (brain damage).
2.  **The Islamic Story of Death and the Tree:** Told as an example of a fatalistic, non-Buddhist view of destiny. The man tries to flee his destined death but ends up exactly where Death expected him. The speaker contrasts this with the Buddhist view that destiny can be changed through wise choice.
3.  **Getting Lost in the Woods / Going in Circles:** Used to explain relapse in practice. Even if you turn away from the "cliff" (suffering) once, if you get lost (stop being mindful), you'll likely circle back to your old habits and fall off the cliff again. This emphasizes the need for continuous practice.
4.  **The Pianist (Speaker's Personal Story):** The speaker explains how he lost his ability to play piano because he stopped practicing for decades. This directly analogizes to losing the skill of wholesome thinking and meditation if practice is abandoned.
5.  **Social Media / Public Figures (Elon Musk, Donald Trump):** Used as modern, relatable examples of how craving for praise and attention (or engaging in unwholesome speech/action) creates suffering and ruins reputations, illustrating the karmic results of unwise action.

### **Core Narrative Framework:**
The entire talk is structured around a **chain of causality metaphor**: **Thoughts/Feelings → Speech → Actions → Habits → Destiny.** The stories and metaphors are all used to illustrate points within this framework—how the chain is formed, how it leads to a fixed destiny (the cliff, the swordsman), and how it can be broken and reformed through mindful choice and persistent practice (turning around, putting down the sword, pushing the swing, threading the needle).

The overarching message, supported by these metaphors and stories, is that **destiny is not predetermined** but is shaped by habitual actions, which themselves can be changed by working backward through the chain, starting with observing and changing one's thoughts.
