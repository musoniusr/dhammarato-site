### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, nice. So I kind of, I don't know if it's true, but I feel like when I'm anxious or maybe worried about something in the future, because I believe that I cannot love all the sensations that I will have, at this later point of time. For example, if I'm afraid of, you know, maybe not having the job I have today because I feel like I'm going to be dissatisfied with the next one. So I'm like unsatisfied right now to prevent me from being unsatisfied later. And so I feel like that's how Dukkha works, kind of. Maybe one way it works.

**Speaker B:** Well, we normally move from dissatisfaction to maybe a short satisfaction back into dissatisfaction, and we go in that cycle. On a regular basis. And how we're learning to interrupt that cycle is by intentionally putting the mind in a good state, to intentionally bring it back. At least right now it's satisfied, but we have to keep practicing that over and over again because there's kind of a momentum.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** That builds up. It's almost like that we're going downhill. That's why they use words like hitting rock bottom and things like that. So there's kind of a gravity or something that's pulling us. So we have to keep remembering to tap the brakes, to tap, to stop. Otherwise the agitation will build up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can see the, sometimes the stream of thoughts, and when I interrupt it, I can almost see like where it would lead, and how much trouble that would have been if I didn't notice, like fast enough, or— Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So this is what we're practicing with that gladdening of the mind, or changing the thoughts from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. This is just about the whole practice, but it has to be practiced over and over and over again. Just like any beautiful piece of music has to be practiced over and over and over again before it's worthwhile being, let us say, demonstrated or performed in public. But it's only after that happens quite a lot to where the musician really feels at home and comfortable with that piece of music so that he can play his way through it, literally play like a toy. Yeah. So there's these two stages of practice that can be referred to as, in the beginning, a practice that is almost like more work And then in public, after we practice things, then we perform it. And after we perform long enough, we get so skilled with that performance that now it becomes playful. Now it becomes a dance. And these things happen in almost all skills. It happens certainly in martial art. That you could say, in fact, the black belt itself, the first black belt, is that acknowledgment: now it's time to perform, you've practiced enough. But those higher Dans, those higher black belts, are for those who are making that progress from performing arts into a lifestyle.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So this is what we're also looking for in the sense of can we sit in private and get our mind in a really good state so that we can go start to deal with the world and keep the mind in a really good state? And then after we practice that for a long time, that means that now we can deal with the world in a really good state. But we had to practice and perform that and do it over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel like I'm at the point where I try to transfer the sitting practice to the everyday life. And also wanted to ask you a bit about what anchor I could use during my life to remember enough, because I tend to forget a lot more than when I'm You know, at home, when I'm actually in this environment.

**Speaker B:** One's life is absolutely filled with anchors. All we have to do is to get a shortlist. OK.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And the Buddha has some recommended. One is the recommendation of changing postures, which we'll talk about in a moment. And the other one is when we're using our hands, the touching, reaching, grasping, holding cycles that we go through in our lifestyle. The way that we're trained in the West is that we pay attention to the object. I mean, after all, I'm holding this object because I want it. If I didn't want the object right now, I probably wouldn't be holding it. It depends upon how heavy it is and all kinds of stuff, or it's going to be handy, as they say. Okay. And what we're beginning to change now is the focus from the object that we're holding into the act of holding the hands themselves. We're beginning to pay attention to what the body itself is doing. Rather than the body is only operating on the object and we're paying attention to the object. So it's a change of focus. Watching what the hands are doing, and the way that we can do that is just the easy, comfortable way, is to talk about slowing the actions of the hands down. To become aware and mindful of what the hands are doing, because the hands are actually quite busy often doing things that we're not paying any attention to at all. People strumming, or let us say, in any particular meeting, notice how much agitation, worry, and flurry, and shuffling of papers, and wrapping of the pencils, and all kinds of stuff is happening. Because people are not paying attention to what the body is doing. So when we're sitting quietly in meditation and actually keeping the hands still is one way of practice. The new way of practicing is to not, let us say, work with holding the hands still and doing it that way, but rather go ahead and have the intention of using the hands all you please. Just slowly and carefully watch what you're doing.

**Speaker A:** So I must not lose the awareness of what I'm doing, my fingers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, whatever the hand pan is to do, pay close attention to what the hands are doing upon that object. So let me find something, an example. All right, so here's the example, is this piece of tape. When I'm approaching it, I'm going to open my hands widely, intentionally, and then narrow down with the idea of what's the first thing that I'm going to touch? Is it going to be with the thumb or the finger or something like that? But I'm going to start paying attention now when I'm picking it up to what does each finger feel?

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes.

**Speaker B:** Am I aware of each of the fingers? Is all— think all 5 fingers are touching this object? Does each of the— because each finger is sending information back, but I'm not generally paying attention to it, and this starts to slip.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there is a lot of information.

**Speaker B:** And there is a lot of information there. So we begin to pay attention to the information that our hands are sending us. Because they're chock-a-block full of tiny bits of information, much of which is actually quite pleasurable. Just to allow the hands to touch things. I mean, this is the reason why we pet dogs. We enjoy using our hands. Humans are like that. And so we should actually get in touch with that touch sensation. So that's one item, is the hands. Now there's also the idea of the postures of the body that we can begin to use and to focus, because after all, this is a body meditation. Anapanasati is about the body, learning the body, relaxing the body, and paying attention to what postures the body is in and what movements the body is making. So we can also look at it in the sense of the postures of what is my face doing, what are my hands doing in relation to the face, and am I sitting, am I standing, am I lying down? And when I'm doing any of those postures, when I change posture, that's a good point in time. An example now that I'm giving you is the chair meditation. Whenever you get out of the chair, why are you getting out of the chair? I mean, there you are, all comfortable and serene, and everything is wonderful and nice, and now we're getting up.

**Speaker C:** Why?

**Speaker B:** We start questioning, why is it that we're getting up out of the chair? And a way to help us do that is normally when people getting up out of a chair in our society, they're getting up to go. We're not just standing up, we're going someplace.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** That in fact, if the only times that we would be standing up would be because some guest has come into the room, and generally that's not often, perhaps maybe the cops. So getting up is not what we normally do. It's going. So the recommendation with this new process that we can actually call meditation is the anchor of that. Whenever you get up, you stand up and you wait for a couple of seconds and then start to move. But you want to stand up and gain stability with the thought of Why did I get out of my chair? What's the point? So we begin to reflect upon, you know, because the reason you got out of the chair is because when you were in the chair, you thought of something. And oftentimes we're thinking of something, and the next thing we know, we're out running towards it, like the refrigerator or the bathroom or the other room, whatever. We're heading that direction without even giving a thought of the thoughts we're having. Yeah. So how many times a day do you get up out of your chair? 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times?

**Speaker A:** Probably around, uh, 20, I guess.

**Speaker B:** We'll start to keep track of this. Yeah. Start to notice. I mean, just as an observation throughout the day, how many times do you get up and why. And when you do get up, stand up to nail this home. A lot of students come back and say, you know, I could get about 10 steps away from the chair and then I would remember. My answer to that would be, okay, that's when you stop, you stand, and you reflect. I made it 10 steps before I remembered to stand. Let me shorten that distance next time. So we kind of plan in a little goal of Sati because it's a very easy thing just to remember. And so this is how we're going to start plotting our, let us say, next practice of Sati is to become aware of the things that we're doing. And getting up out of a chair is a really excellent one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the next one is, is that, well, getting up out of a chair is good. What about sitting down in a chair? Because that's also changing our posture. The answer to that is, is that yes, in fact, we do sit down in the chair to basically take a load off of our feet. So why don't we also use that as an opportunity to unload the mind also? So every time that you sit down in the chair, not all the time. This is the mentality of the Westerners. But whenever you're sitting down, remember that as you're sitting down, you're actually going to relax intentionally. You're not sitting down to get work done. You're not sitting down to come piddle on the keyboard or to write an email. You're sitting down to sit down, to take a load off, to relax. And so now is the time for taking a deep breath and just relax and take 2 or 3, maybe 4 deep breaths and get your mind in a really, really good state to reward yourself for having sat down. And now we can go do whatever we were intending to do. But we're beginning to put these brakes in there more often. So now every time you stand up, you've got to— why did I leave? What's the point of me leaving? And every time I sit down, I come back into that state of everything is okay, everything is fine. Wow, no need to get up. Next time I start to get up, I'll remember I don't have to really get up now, do I? I can sit here.

**Speaker A:** It breaks up the day with Sati a lot more, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Yes, many times during the day gives you an opportunity for Sati. Every time that you pick something up with your hands, yeah, almost think of it also with the breath, that when you pick something up, you also take a deep breath. Whenever you put something back down, you do so with an intentional deep long out-breath aside. Wow, I've let that go. Don't have to worry about that anymore. And so by this slowing down of getting up, instead of getting up and going, we get up and we stand. That when we sit down, we don't sit down to keep going, we sit down to stop and relax. And slowing the hands down, we're tying it more and more with the breath. And so this is the way that we can begin to practice Knowing that you're going to forget about doing this a lot of the time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm sure.

**Speaker B:** Instead of fussing at yourself for forgetting, when you do remember, congratulate yourself for, I did remember this time.

**Speaker A:** I remembered that I forgot.

**Speaker B:** And that is okay that you forgot, but it's even more okay that you remember. And yet when we remember, we fuss at ourselves for having forgotten, instead of praising ourselves for this time having remembered. Funny that we're hard on ourselves for the wrong reasons. We should congratulate ourselves when we remember to practice, rather than fussing at ourselves when we remember to practice. Isn't that interesting? Because how can you possibly out of the blue just start fussing at yourself for having forgotten to do something? No, you don't do it, that you remember to do it, and then that's when you fuss at yourself for having forgotten when in fact you didn't forget, you remembered it right now. Yeah, so this is the practice that we're going to have, is to make the intention to remember and then congratulate yourself when you do remember.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay.

**Speaker B:** That's the way to go. So, do you have any questions about this?

**Speaker A:** Yes, when usually I focus on the breath when I'm sitting. So, when I'm doing things, maybe focusing on my hands, some awareness will not be directed to the breath. At the same time. Is this, is this all right, or is the correct practice supposed to be at the same time the breath and the hands and the standing up? I'm kind of having— so sometimes when I sit, I feel like a good feeling, and then I focus on the good feeling and I forget about the breath. And so I'm not too hard on myself about this, but I'm just wondering like, what would the correct practice be?

**Speaker B:** Well, putting the engineer's hat on, the question is, what do you mean by "at the same time"?

**Speaker A:** Well, I heard you say this already, like you cannot focus on two things.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. So things happen, they don't happen at the same time, unless you're having a particular perspective of a time period or a time. Okay, so back— in fact, the further things go back in time, the more the time compresses, so that it looks like that the Greek civilization and the Roman civilization were deeply embedded and entwined, where no, the glory of the Greek civilization was long before the Romans. And in fact, the Romans just came in and wiped out the Greeks and took their culture. And that helped the Romans. But this was all at different time periods. And so we kind of think when we're kids that all of that happened at the same time because it happened in ancient history.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And that we also see coincidences that may have fairly large periods of time between them. This happened, and then I think about it happening at the same time that this other thing happens, and I think that they're related to where in fact the The only relationship is my mind. That's the relation. That's where the relationship is. That's the glue, is our memories and our recollections. So in that regard, we can say that everything is happening, but a lot of stuff is happening very fast, that there's a huge amount of overplay and interreactions and whatnot like that. But the way that the human brain operates is kind of on a clock or a cycle that they refer to often as the alpha wave, which could be like one mind moment in that wave time, which they've recorded. And there's a lot of ways of recording it, and with examples would be reaction time, because most people have a reaction time about 300 milliseconds, maybe down to 250, maybe down if you're very sharp like a black belt, they're down at about 200 milliseconds. But stars, the Heisman Trophy winners or the superstars, their reaction time is even faster, down to about maybe 185, 180. That would be world-class of how quick our reaction times. And a lot of sports actually operate on trying to get that reaction time fast increased. We can actually train to get that reaction time fast. That's what Sati really is all about, is how quick can we wake up and do something. So this whole idea of reaction time is not just a scientific puzzle for humans, it's actually really built into Anapanasati also. Are we going to let the mind sit there and dream and dream and dream and dream and dream and then interrupt it? Are we going to quick it quickly as soon as it happens? Aha, I see you.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And in this regard, what we mean then is, is that our time, because we're speeding up or watching what's going on, the surprise is, is that the practice that we do is we slow things down so that we get a different perspective of it, to where in fact what we're actually doing is speeding things up in another regard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so when we understand that when we start slowing things down, we begin to actually see the intervals like slow motion. We begin to see the intervals that we used to think all this happened at the same time, to in fact, no, it doesn't. Each one is on its own. I've got a really clear experiment of that. And that is, is that I've got a LED torch, a flashlight. And when I shine that on the fan of the CPU, it looks like it is going very, very, very slowly. It's almost alarmingly, oh, the CPU fan's not working. But if I take that flashlight away from that, and look at the blades themselves, they're spinning very fast. But the speed of the light is, in fact, it's got its own frequency that is actually a pulsating light. It's not a solid light. If it were a solid light like a fluorescent, but this light is actually a LED that's pulsing. And because of that pulsing part of it, this is exactly the same reason why wheels on cars look like sometimes they're running backwards on videos. Okay, it's because of the timing between the video camera doing its thing and the wheels doing its thing. And when they coincide, it looks like that the wheels are standing still or moving very, very slowly, right? Okay, yeah, but they're in fact not related. The relationship is in the eye of the human being. That sees these standing waves. Okay. And so what we can then recognize is, oh, that means that a whole lot of stuff is happening at a whole lot of different frequencies. And what human beings are able to do is see the interference and the waves that stand and whatnot like that with all of this stuff that's happening. And that's what we're good at. This is the pattern recognition that makes the human brain that we can see patterns. Okay, and the whole delusion is the patterns of things that are happening, quote-unquote, at the same time, or happen to line up, or certain ways like that. But this is all human perception. And when we stop perceiving things and start looking at them more directly, that means that we're actually speeding up our camera, which is another way of saying that when the camera speed is very high, that means that now We can actually approach it as if it were going in slow motion.

**Speaker A:** Is that why like 10 minutes of sitting or maybe, you know, like when you exercise and you do a plank, 1 minute passes by like very long time. And when you like having fun and thinking about stuff.

**Speaker B:** Now that, actually what you're talking about there is a psychological trick that's being played.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And what is that? That if you give the students 45 minutes to sit or an hour to sit, then they're not going to just go do it. They're going to sit there for a long time waiting to do it. Then the mind gets tired and then they don't want to do it anymore and they want the bell to ring and they wasted their 45 minutes. But if you give them 10 minutes and say, sit down and be happy for the next 10 minutes, and the students will actually do it. Oh, I don't have much time. I'm actually going to go ahead and do it now.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Oh yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's another reason for putting time periods short, is to say, okay, you got 10 minutes, wake up, be.

**Speaker C:** Happy for 10 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Now we're actually taking it from 10 minutes down to, uh, less than 1 minute, down to maybe about 10 seconds every time you sit down. Go through the whole thing in Jhana, Anapanasati, and do it now in 10 seconds. Practice speeding that up. So first, 45 minutes to be happy and failing. Now we're doing it in 10 minutes successfully. Can we now do it in 10 seconds every time we sit down? Every time that we pick up an object, can we come into the present moment, be here now, Because you have plenty of opportunity. All we have to do is choose the anchors.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of anchors already, especially with the hands, like all the time.

**Speaker B:** You'd be surprised because people are generally in a state of agitation much of the time, peddling with things, holding things, doing things with their hands. And when we start to pay attention to that, sometimes we don't even like it. We think that now that we're looking at our hands, we say, I'm even more agitated than I used to be.

**Speaker C:** When I wasn't watching the hands.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, the hands were more agitated then, you just didn't know it. Now that you're watching the hands, you can see how agitated they are. Or another way of saying it is that they are hungry for sensory input.

**Speaker C:** The hands themselves are hungry for sensory input, which means that if we pay attention to that sensory input, that makes the hands feel even more satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, kind of see what you mean.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And Is the— how to say this? I felt like when I'm doing— when I'm being more aware, when I'm practicing, taking the time to sit, I feel like I have a lot more free time. And when I'm always doing stuff, I have the same time, but the day passes by really quick. Is this kind of like related to the psychological aspect?

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. You're right that in fact, that if we've gotten ourselves into a habit of, I don't have much time, then that means that we have to crowd a whole lot of activity into the time that we have.

**Speaker C:** And that's the Western mentality. What we're doing here instead is we're beginning to slow down. And as we do, we recognize that, hey, I've got a huge amount of time. I have so much time, in fact.

**Speaker B:** That I can waste it happily.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that feels really good. Just do nothing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I've got so much time on my hands. Literally, my hands don't have to do anything. That we have been lied to in our society.

**Speaker B:** The whole society lies to everyone, and the whole crowd of us are in the same ball of lies. And that lie can actually— can you can say that there is a one-word description for that whole pack of lies?, and that is the word important.

**Speaker C:** Make stuff important, and now people have to do it. When things are not important, there's nothing to.

**Speaker A:** Do. Yeah, I mean, important is a matter of, uh, who's watching the— like, what you think about the sensation or the.

**Speaker B:** The thing you're— and so we've got a new way of importance, and the.

**Speaker C:** Importance now is the importance to just watch what's forward and be here now. Experience what reality there is right here, right now. Because otherwise, the importance is a false.

**Speaker A:** Importance about the future.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Right now. So this is a whole new way of looking. And when we look to slow down, we begin to recognize there's an abundance of everything.

**Speaker C:** I've just been missing it all because I was in.

**Speaker A:** Cenexa. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, well, I guess I just have to practice right now.

**Speaker C:** All right, well, that's right.

**Speaker B:** You keep practicing, keep coming back, keep coming back, keep coming back over and.

**Speaker C:** Over and over again. Keep watching what you're doing. And making sure that what you're doing is wholesome. Breaking those wholesome thoughts back in until you have one wholesome thought after another after another. This is the practice, but it needs to be repeated over and over again. So every time you sit down, repeat that a few times. Every time you stand up, go through that. I'm standing up, what's the point of this? You know, I could sit back down. I bet you'll even find sometimes that after you stand up, you'll sigh and sit right back down and laugh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I didn't have to go anywhere.

**Speaker C:** At all, did.

**Speaker A:** I? Yeah, or maybe you walk back to the.

**Speaker C:** Chair.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right, I'll start practicing this.

**Speaker C:** I'll let you know how it goes. Okay, we'll see you again. Congratulations on your practice. I see that you're making good progress.

**Speaker A:** Good. Thank you. Have a good day.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. You have a really good moment right now. Thank you. That's all I can help.

**Speaker C:** The future I don't know about, but right now have a good day.

**Speaker A:** That's good to know. All right, see you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching is about **interrupting the habitual cycle of dissatisfaction (Dukkha) by cultivating mindfulness (Sati) throughout the day, using simple physical actions as "anchors."**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: The Cycle of Dissatisfaction**
*   We often move from dissatisfaction to brief satisfaction and back to dissatisfaction.
*   Anxiety about the future (e.g., a future job) can cause us to be unsatisfied in the present as a misguided form of self-protection.

### **The Solution: Intentional Practice**
The practice involves two key stages:
1.  **Practice in Private:** Like a musician, you must first train your mind in solitude to enter a wholesome, satisfied state (e.g., through meditation).
2.  **Performance in Public:** Then, you practice maintaining that good state while engaging with the world, until it becomes a natural, playful "lifestyle."

### **Practical Method: Anchors for Daily Mindfulness**
To transfer practice from the cushion to daily life, use frequent physical actions as reminders to "tap the brakes" on mental agitation:

1.  **The Hands:** Shift focus from the *object* you're holding to the *sensations in the hands themselves*. Slow down hand movements to become aware of the touch, which is often pleasurable and grounding.
2.  **Changing Postures (Primary Anchor):**
    *   **Standing Up:** When you get up from a chair, **stand still for a moment**. Ask yourself, *"Why am I getting up?"* Reflect on the thought that triggered the action instead of mindlessly rushing.
    *   **Sitting Down:** When you sit, **pause to relax**. Take a few deep breaths and intentionally set the mind in a good, calm state *before* starting the next activity.
3.  **The Breath:** Tie actions to the breath. Inhale deeply when picking something up; exhale slowly and release tension when putting it down.

### **Essential Attitude: Kindness & Repetition**
*   **You will forget.** This is expected. The key is not to scold yourself when you remember you forgot, but to **congratulate yourself for remembering in that moment.**
*   The practice must be **repeated over and over** to build momentum against the "gravity" of habitual dissatisfaction.

### **Profound Shifts from This Practice**
*   **Perception of Time:** Slowing down intentional actions makes you feel like you have **more abundant time**, contrary to the rushed "not enough time" mentality.
*   **Seeing "Importance":** Much of our stress comes from labeling things as "important," which is often a future-oriented illusion. True importance is being present "here and now."
*   **Increased Awareness:** You may notice your hands (and mind) are more agitated than you realized, but paying attention to sensory input can satisfy that hunger for stimulation.

### **Answer to a Practitioner's Question**
**Q:** "Should I focus on the breath *and* my hands *at the same time*?"
**A:** The mind can't focus on two things in the same instant. The practice is about **quickly cycling awareness** between anchors (breath, hands, posture) with increasing speed and skill (like shortening your "reaction time" to distraction). It's about frequent re-centering, not simultaneous focus.

**In essence:** The talk teaches a gentle, practical method of using your body's natural movements as constant invitations to interrupt autopilot, return to the present, and cultivate a wholesome, satisfied mind throughout the day.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain mindfulness practice and the nature of the mind. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Downhill Cycle / Gravity & Brakes:**
    *   **Speaker B** describes the mind's habitual cycle of dissatisfaction as having a kind of **"momentum"** or **"gravity"** pulling it down. This is why we use phrases like **"hitting rock bottom."** The practice is like intentionally **"tapping the brakes"** to stop this downward pull and interrupt the agitation.

2.  **Practicing Music / The Skill Spectrum (Work → Performance → Play):**
    *   **Speaker B** compares mindfulness practice to learning a piece of music.
        *   **First Stage (Work):** You must practice "over and over and over again" in private, like a musician rehearsing alone.
        *   **Second Stage (Performance):** After enough practice, you can "perform" — meaning you can maintain a good state of mind while dealing with the world.
        *   **Third Stage (Play/Dance):** With even more skill, it becomes **"playful"** and a **"dance,"** a natural and effortless part of your lifestyle. This progression is also likened to advancing in martial arts, from earning a black belt (ready to perform) to higher degrees (integrating it into your life).

3.  **Anchors:**
    *   This is a central metaphor. **Speaker B** says **"One's life is absolutely filled with anchors."** An anchor is a routine physical action or event (like changing posture, using your hands, or breathing) that you can use to "anchor" your attention back to the present moment and to mindfulness.

4.  **The Camera & Slow Motion:**
    *   To explain how we perceive time and simultaneous events, **Speaker B** uses the metaphor of a **camera**.
    *   Our normal, agitated perception is like a camera with a slow shutter speed, making separate events seem to happen at the same time (like a strobe light making a fan blade appear still or moving slowly).
    *   Mindfulness practice is like **"speeding up our camera"** (increasing our awareness/frame rate). This allows us to see the gaps and the true sequence of events, which feels like **"slow motion"** because we perceive more detail. This helps break the "delusion" of patterns our mind creates.

5.  **The Hungry Hands:**
    *   When discussing fidgeting, **Speaker B** suggests that our restless hands are **"hungry for sensory input."** By paying mindful attention to the sensations of touch, we can "feed" and satisfy that hunger, leading to calm.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Chair Meditation:**
    *   **Speaker B** tells a detailed story-like practice: using the act of **getting out of a chair** as an anchor. Instead of getting up to immediately "go," you stand up, pause, and ask, **"Why did I get out of my chair?"** This interrupts automatic pilot. He even shares that students often remember 10 steps later, and the practice is to shorten that distance of forgetfulness.

2.  **The Historical Compression Story:**
    *   To illustrate that we compress time and create false connections, **Speaker B** refers to how we often think of **Greek and Roman civilizations** as happening simultaneously. In reality, they were separated by significant time, but our minds (especially when learning history as children) glue them together. This is analogous to how we think worries or thoughts are connected to present actions when often they are not.

3.  **The 10-Minute vs. 45-Minute Sitting:**
    *   **Speaker B** shares a psychological insight framed as a scenario: If you give someone **45 minutes** to sit and be happy, they procrastinate and waste the time waiting. If you give them just **10 minutes**, they think, "I don't have much time, I'll do it now." This story supports the strategy of using **short, frequent practices** (like 10-second anchors) throughout the day instead of relying on long, daunting sessions.

4.  **The "Important" Lie:**
    *   **Speaker B** frames a common societal condition as a story: **"The whole society lies to everyone... and that is the word *important*."** We are told things are urgently important, which creates agitation and a feeling of having no time. The new story is that true importance is **"to just watch what's happening and be here now,"** which reveals an **"abundance"** of time.

### **Overall Narrative Metaphor:**
The entire talk uses the metaphor of **mindfulness as a skill-based training regimen** (like music or martial arts) where you use **"anchors"** throughout your day to **"tap the brakes"** on your mind's automatic **"downhill"** momentum. By doing so, you move from seeing life as a frantic, time-scarce performance to experiencing it as a more spacious, playful, and sensory-rich dance.
