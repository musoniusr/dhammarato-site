### Transcript


**Speaker A:** The game per se of the school itself. Like, I feel like I can do it better, you know. I can do this, basically.

**Speaker B:** That's the essence of the Dharma, is that you can see the Dukkha and come right back out of it. You got your finger over the camera lens. There you go. All right, so this is the way that we practice, and riding on the train is a good, good time to do it, is to just have happy thoughts. I've had one student reported to me about another student who was saying that he was having trouble with his practice. And the answer to that is that having thoughts of having trouble about the practice is the problem, and that all we have to do is to change that from, "Oh, I'm not having any trouble with the practice, that what I thought was trouble was just ordinary stuff and I can deal with that." and gaining that confidence. I'm really glad to hear that you're getting that confidence, Pedro. That's really marvelous. I know how long you and how much you struggled with it. Yeah, but I keep bringing you back to the same thing over and over again. Never mind all of those thoughts about all the kinds of problems. Ah, I see that stuff. And I can just throw it out, come back and have it be back in that state of well-being. Yeah, I'm glad you're getting it. Don't have to worry about the future. Right now is good enough. [No speech]So when we have those thoughts of everything is okay, everything is all right, we begin to feel that way. Everything is okay, everything is all right, school will take care of itself, you'll be fine, everything is going to work out just right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like having that confidence that, you know, there is a song that goes, no matter what I ever I got summer on the inside. It's a good song that I've heard.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** No matter what, no matter what, I got the summer on the inside.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and no matter what, you've got good friends.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, Mr. Keshe, for reminding me this.

**Speaker B:** So, do you have any particular questions?

**Speaker A:** You know, I wanted to call also to be sure that I can I can remind myself to like, how to say, to— the word is not correct, but to like destroy the whole process of thoughts of worry and anxiety just before it builds up. Like that is the main thing for me, because if I keep like the base clear, of the mind clear at the base, like I will not automatically build the castles of worry and so on. So like that is my, the main thing actually. But also the beautiful thing is that doing so, actually also in the class environment, I'm more reliable actually, like people rely on me, naturally. Like, The other day, my friend, my classmate friend, came to me and it was like shaking and so on. I was like really cool and cold and grounded and so like she gave her hands to me and they were shaking and I just took the hands. I wasn't shaking at all. I took the hands. And like she stopped shaking because I wasn't shaking myself. And so that, that was like a bit of a proof that if I have that cool attitude, that I really don't let anxiety and worry build up into my mind, but I just on top, I just breathe and— yeah, I stay mindful, like basically. If I manage to stay mindful, I can maintain a cool attitude.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so.

**Speaker A:** And that really works because I have also kind of a feedback, you know, that it really works. And so, like, yeah, see the thoughts that come into my mind and invite the wholesome, avoid the unwholesome, and maybe also, like, aspire to wholesome thoughts in the same time. So, like, create new wholesome thoughts. Not just throw out the noise, but also create wholesome thoughts. That maybe sometimes is also could be, actually found out that it could be also school-related thought. Maybe a kind of good activity that I like to do. And so like it just goes beyond the It's about the wholesome attitude, so it like goes beyond only just a comfortable feeling, but I personally like to add also like a good activity I'm gonna do and I remind myself of that. And so that contributes to wholesome feelings.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the word that we're talking about in Pali is called the word Mudita. Mudita. And it's often translated as sympathetic joy. But the important word is sympathetic, that we get into sympathy with others. An example would be at school, if one person becomes agitated and upset and tense, then everybody around them will become agitated, upset, and tense. Along with them because we pick up on other people's vibrations. But then when someone like yourself has had training in mindfulness and Sati, that you go in and you do not let their agitations affect you, that you can stay calm. And by doing that, you start vibrating with calm and they'll start picking up on that too, so that they will become calm because you are calm, that you can be happy and joyful, and that will what they call rub off on them. That we, we like humans, we're social animals, and what one person does, another person does. In fact, the old story is monkey see, monkey do. So when they— right, and so when they see you being calm, joyful, happy, confident, capable of handling things, that will rub off on them for the moment. But they too would have to practice that just like you practiced it in order for it to be able to stay and become a skill. So congratulations, you're actually practicing, you're developing skills that other people in your class just don't have.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, actually I would say that maybe also more experienced people, like for, uh, for profession, like they develop a sort of mindfulness sometimes. Especially if you have to work, if you have responsibility, sometimes you can develop some mindfulness, I've noticed. But it's more like mindfulness of the system, I don't know how to say. Like they remember very good, like the rules and the stuff and the way they can move. And the things they have to do and so on. But maybe on a more, you know—.

**Speaker B:** Perhaps the word you're looking for is circumstances, the situation. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like it's maybe, yeah, they have like mindfulness work related sometimes. Like basically, yeah, they develop a certain mindfulness related to the work. But also like I feel like if you, it's like a consequence of having certain responsibilities and also having certain work to do. But like training for mindfulness itself is a whole different thing because you have a really conscious approach. And so like it's not a consequence, but it's the main thing there. And so it's, yeah, it's another level again of, it's conscious mindfulness like you practice. And so you develop that. And so like, I feel like I can make my experience and, well, I have to keep practicing of course, but I think I can make my experience in meditation like a good, can make a good impact.

**Speaker B:** Exactly so. That's true, that you do have that sort of increase because you've gotten the skills developed. That's the whole point. That some, for instance, in music, when somebody learns to play the piano, they can play the piece correctly, but they really have to pay close attention to it. But once they gain the skill of playing that piece over and over and over again, Then they get confidence in it and they can play it almost without thinking about it. OK, so these skills build up. So if you keep practicing like that, that confidence will grow. And you'll be able to handle those situations, those circumstances that would in the old days keep you tense and uptight. Now you're the one who is calm and happy while everybody else is getting uptight, and they look to you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, totally.

**Speaker B:** So I'm really pleased. I mean, this is quite a breakthrough for you over the past several weeks. I'm really glad to see you doing this. But remember, you got to keep it up. You got to keep practicing. Don't think that you've arrived any place, because the old habits will just come right back again.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Yeah, I have to keep practicing, like, keep doing this wonderful work on mindful breathing whenever I can, whenever I remember to, and practice in difficult situation, as we say. Yeah, being present, keep being mindful, and like, do not allow castles of worry, as I call them, in the mind. Yeah. Oh yeah, looking from this perspective that you that we share together today is like, yeah, actually is kind of a breakthrough for me.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can see it. I'm impressed. I'm really glad that you've made that breakthrough. Rather than going back, oh, well, I'm having a bad day today, I'm not going to practice meditation, you can say, oh, That bad day is just a thought, and I see that stuff, and I can come back and have my confidence, have my peace of mind, my joy, have satisfaction in life because we practice it. In a way, you practice being a winner. Practice being successful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I will do that. I will keep doing that. Yeah, I will definitely keep doing this, and keep practicing.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, Pedro, why don't we finish the call now and let you continue your practice? And this is a good time for you to call when you're on the train in the morning, so call me often.

**Speaker A:** We saw that this was— this could This will work, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this works just fine.

**Speaker A:** Oh, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato. I really appreciate talking with you. I thank you too. I really enjoy having you as a friend.

**Speaker A:** Ah, wonderful. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a student, Pedro (Speaker A):

**Core Teaching:** The essence of the practice is to recognize suffering (dukkha) or unwholesome mental states (like worry and anxiety) and consciously choose to return to a state of well-being, confidence, and happiness. The key is not to get caught in stories about problems but to change one's relationship to thoughts.

**Main Points:**

1.  **Confidence in the Practice:** Dhammarato emphasizes that the thought "I'm having trouble with my practice" is itself the problem. The solution is to cultivate confidence by shifting to the perspective: "I'm not having trouble; what I thought was trouble is just ordinary stuff I can handle."
2.  **"Summer on the Inside":** The student shares a metaphor of having an inner, unshakable well-being ("summer on the inside") regardless of external circumstances, supported by good friends and the Dhamma.
3.  **Practical Application – Stopping Anxiety at the Base:** Pedro's main insight is to "destroy" the process of worry and anxiety *before* it builds up. By keeping the "base of the mind clear" through mindfulness and breathing, he prevents "castles of worry" from forming.
4.  **Social Impact of Calm (Mudita):** Pedro gives a powerful example: by remaining calm and grounded when a classmate was shaking with anxiety, his calmness ("sympathetic joy" or *mudita*) helped her calm down. Dhammarato explains this as a vibrational effect—calmness is contagious, just as agitation is.
5.  **Skill Development:** The practice is compared to learning a musical instrument. Initially, it requires conscious effort, but with repeated practice, it becomes a confident skill. This cultivated mindfulness is distinct from the situational awareness people develop at work; it is a conscious, foundational training.
6.  **Warning Against Complacency:** Dhammarato congratulates Pedro on a significant breakthrough but cautions him not to think he has "arrived." Old habits can return, so consistent practice is essential—especially using mundane moments (like a train ride) to cultivate "happy thoughts" and well-being.

**Conclusion:** The talk celebrates a student's tangible progress in applying mindfulness to overcome anxiety and become a source of stability for others. The central message is that peace and confidence are always accessible through a simple shift in attention and attitude, but this requires diligent, ongoing practice to master as a skill.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key metaphors and stories used in the talk:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **"Finger over the camera lens":** Used by Speaker B (the teacher) to represent a distorted or obscured perspective. Clearing the finger away is a metaphor for removing the mental obstruction (worry, anxiety) to see reality clearly again.
2.  **"Castles of worry":** Used by Speaker A (the student) to describe how anxious thoughts aren't just passing clouds, but elaborate, self-built structures in the mind. The practice is to stop building these "castles" at their foundation.
3.  **"Summer on the inside":** From a song referenced by Speaker A, this is a metaphor for an internal, unshakable state of warmth, peace, and well-being that persists regardless of external circumstances ("no matter what").
4.  **"Vibrations" / "Rub off":** Speaker B uses the metaphor of people emitting and picking up on emotional "vibrations." Agitation or calmness can be "picked up" by others, and a calm person's state can "rub off" on an agitated one, like a contagious quality.
5.  **"Monkey see, monkey do":** Used as a proverbial metaphor to illustrate how humans, as social animals, unconsciously mimic the emotional and behavioral states of those around them.
6.  **"Riding on the train":** This is presented as a specific, ideal time to practice. It metaphorically represents a routine, in-between moment in daily life that can be transformed into a opportunity for mindful practice.
7.  **"Playing the piano":** Speaker B uses the skill development in music as a metaphor for mindfulness. At first, it requires intense, conscious effort (paying close attention), but with practice, it becomes a confident, almost automatic skill that can be relied upon.

### **Stories / Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Anxious Friend:** Speaker A shares a personal story about a classmate who came to them shaking with anxiety. By maintaining his own calm, grounded state ("I wasn't shaking at all") and physically holding his friend's hands, his calmness caused her shaking to stop. This story serves as a concrete "proof" of the principle that inner stability directly affects and stabilizes the environment and people around you.
2.  **The Student Having Trouble:** Speaker B references a generic story about a student who reported "having trouble with his practice." The teacher's response reframes the problem: the thought *"I'm having trouble"* is itself the trouble. The lesson is that shifting the narrative to *"I can deal with this ordinary stuff"* builds confidence. This is a teaching story to illustrate a common pitfall and its solution.
3.  **The Implied Narrative of Pedro's Journey:** The entire conversation is underpinned by an unspoken story—Pedro's (Speaker A) own journey from long struggle ("I know how long you and how much you struggled") to a recent "breakthrough." The dialogue itself traces the arc of this story: past struggle, current success with evidence (the friend story), and future advice to maintain the practice lest "old habits" return.

### **Core Conceptual Frameworks (which use metaphorical language):**

*   **Dharma/Dukkha:** The entire teaching is based on the Buddhist framework of *Dharma* (the path) and *Dukkha* (suffering/stress). The process is described as seeing the *Dukkha* (worry, anxiety) and knowing how to "come right back out of it."
*   **Mudita (Sympathetic Joy):** Introduced by Speaker B, this is the wholesome mental state of finding joy in the well-being of others. It's framed as a positive "vibration" to cultivate, in contrast to picking up on agitation.
*   **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts:** The practice is described not just as "throwing out the noise" (unwholesome thoughts) but actively "creating new wholesome thoughts" and aspiring to them. This is the active gardening of the mind's landscape.

In summary, the talk uses **practical metaphors** (camera lens, castles, vibrations) to make mental processes tangible, **personal and teaching stories** to provide evidence and illustrate principles, and **skill-building metaphors** (piano practice) to frame mindfulness as a trainable, reliable skill.
