### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Doesn'T want to back down.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Yes. So you can in fact begin to change those thoughts if you can see them. This is what Sati is all about. This is what insight— insight actually means, aha, I see that I'm using words like sporadic. I can see the feelings that come with the word like sporadic, and you can also see that you have different feelings when you use words like I do remember sometimes. So can you start to change that language from sporadic, which is the kind of language that a victim uses, the kind of language that's talking about that it's not up to scratch, it's not up to a set of rules, it's not up to standards, it's not good enough, and start to nurturing yourself in this. Just, hot dog, I did remember! I remembered to call Dhammarato. And so this is the basic instructions. There's all this— that's all there is to it, is start to see all the unwholesomeness that you have in your mind so that you can start to change it. That's all there is to it, is to remove unwholesome thoughts and replace them with wholesome thoughts. It's good in the beginning that way. It's really good in the middle that way. And wow, it's really good if you ever get to the end of it.

**Speaker A:** Do you get to the end of it?

**Speaker B:** Well, every time you remember, that's the end of it. If you let it be the end, and next time's another day, and next time's another hour.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's almost like, uh, for me it feels like, uh, it's counterintuitive because it feels more like a surrender. It feels like a letting go, not enacting my will, not compartmentalizing.

**Speaker B:** I don't use the word surrender. That's a victim's word. That's a loser's word. That's actually an Islamic word. That's what the word Islam means, is surrender. Okay, a better word I use, in fact, is throw it out. To see those thoughts as unwholesome and change them. Don't surrender them to nothing. Become your own champion. So, let us say something like you got a broken arm. Some people can say, "Oh, well, you've got to accept that you've got a broken arm. You've got to surrender to you have the broken arm." It's going to take a long time for the arm to heal with that attitude. A much better attitude was, "Oh, I've got a broken arm. I'm going to make sure that I hold my hand still. I'm going to put that arm in a sling and I'm going to take care of it, and it's going to heal." You see the difference? One's a negative attitude, "Oh, I can't do anything about it. Oh, poor me. Oh, I have to surrender." That's why there are so many millions and millions and millions of unhappy Muslims, because they surrender. Instead of making a joke out of it, a surrender is actually an unhappy, disappointing kind of situation. Surrender is what you do after you've lost.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I would rather have it another way, but I'm gonna have to put up with this.

**Speaker B:** Well, all you have to do is start changing your attitude. Remember that you can change your attitude, that you're not surrendering at all. No need to surrender. Become the champion. You can handle that. A much better word, in fact, would be an armistice rather than a surrender. Hey, we can quit fighting. You don't have to surrender to your enemies. You can just call it off. You can become the champion. So start watching the language that you use in your own mind, that language.

**Speaker A:** Some of the mind movements feel very subtle. They're almost not even fully formed, right?

**Speaker B:** That's why you got to be really clear about watching what's going on, because those thoughts are not even fully formed into words, but they're certainly there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is why we call it an attitude rather than a fully formed thing. Um, let us say it like this: when a tree is cut down and felled, which direction is it going to fall in? Don't the woodcutters know enough about that so that they can actually fix it, so that the tree falls in a certain direction? There's several things that they can do. One is they can tie a rope and start pulling the tree from a very high place in the tree to a very anchored place, so far away from it, and it's saying you're coming this way. All right, but the real point of it is, is that the tree actually has to lean in that direction before it falls. This is what I'm talking about, is the attitude is the leaning, not the full thought form. So the thought would be the tree falling. Well, which direction is going to fall? The direction that you're leaning in. In. So watch the fact that the mind leans before it falls.

**Speaker A:** You got to be quite aware to see that a lot of the times, though, haven't you?

**Speaker B:** That's the skill that we're developing, is that investigation to know which direction the mind is leaning towards. Like, I can do it. Yeah, I'll figure this out. Yeah, that tree's going to fall just where I want it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know. There's, um, this attitude feels intuitively very right, and it feels like what I would have been like when I was a child. But I've had— it feels like those conditionings have been so beaten into you. That you want to look for guru or a god. It's very— it's like a war, looking in a war.

**Speaker B:** Are you going to surrender to that war? Are you going to call the war off? That's the whole point. That's the way that we're doing it, is we're going to call that off and we're going to make friends out of it. We're not— it's not an internal war. And basically, the war is well understood in many psychological circles, where they really understand the psychology of it. Freud had the word superego and id, and the war between the two. Now, Eric Byrne used the term parent, adult, and child. And so that inner being is at war with all the way that things are supposed to be. The parent, the orders, the authorities, the way things should be. And that's the part of you that you actually surrender to. And the better way of doing it is to let both sides make a change in the mind, so that you two can become friends, the parent and the child, can become friends in the sense that the parent can come out of its critical thinking into nurturing thinking. Start nurturing yourself. Anicca, you're okay, you're all right. You're not going to get your way all the time, but your way don't matter. And you're all right. Yeah, you screw up, that's okay. But the parent inside is, oh, you screwed up, oh, you got to do something, all things are terrible. So it depends upon the way that we were parented. Now, the actual two moms and dads parent is not where all the parenting comes from. It comes from teachers, it comes from uncles, it comes from other siblings, especially older siblings. So whoever it was that put you in the— and kept you in the victim's position, doesn't matter who it was. The point is, is that you can reprogram that part of the parent ego state to come out of, oh, you've got to do something in order to be okay. Into, you're already okay, you don't need to do anything. You're already lovable. Are you lovable?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I must be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're lovable. So do it. Love yourself. Accept yourself in that loving way rather than surrendering to the authority. There's no Sky Daddy. There's no Allah the way that the Muslims talk about it. What they really want you to do is surrender to them. Do what you're told to do.

**Speaker A:** I mean, yeah, that can be sort of applied to even school teachers, the governments. To parents, right?

**Speaker B:** To the IRS, to every cop on the block, to prison guards, other prisoners, wherever you are. If you're in a store, you got store clerks, they wind up being your boss if you let them. If you think of them that way, oh, I need your help. Oh, I'm looking for a red widget and all I find are green ones. 'Please fuss at me because I can't look correctly.' And we fall into victimhood with all kinds of people. Why? Because we're in the habit of being a victim. How do I know that? Because you use the word surrender. That's what a victim does. You're the champion here if you have that attitude to lean in the direction that the tree always falls exactly where you want it, as opposed to be the victim that cuts the tree down and falls on the neighbor's fence or his house or his car. That things go exactly the way that you want them to.

**Speaker A:** And that doesn't mean everything externally will sort of play out how you want it. It's your interpretations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, everything's assorted to your own interpretation anyway. That's your perception. And the real point that in fact I've been using the language lately for the students who really understand is that perception means the way that you see things, you made that up. You make it up. The reality is that it doesn't have a reality. The reality is, is that you make it up, you perceive it, and then that becomes your reality. For humans, humans have a very difficult way. I mean, it's almost mentally against us. That we cannot capture, let us say, a scene, or, uh, and yeah, we'll call it a scene. A camera can catch a scene, a video camera can record a scene. Humans don't have scenes that can be recorded like a camera. Their eyes always go through a processing mechanism, the way that the mind is built, and that processing mechanism is always all based in recognition. You see, the camera can take a picture of a speeding car, and the camera don't give a flying rip whether it's a Maserati or a convertible or anything like that. He just sees what's there. But humans, we want to understand way too much about it, and so we make stuff up, and we make it up out of our past. That's where our understanding comes from, right? But you have a choice about what you're going to select out of your past, and you selected surrender because that's what you felt like you had to do at one time. So now you can select something else out of your memories. And this is part of the reason why we want to get a whole lot of new memories that are wholesome, to start adding up and getting good perceptions, good Samskaras, good memories, good feelings, so that later you're more than likely going to choose to use that new data rather than really old data when you're making stuff up.

**Speaker A:** You talk about Samskaras. Is Anapanasati enough to sort of cleanse them or change them?

**Speaker B:** I just gave you that backwards, okay? We're not trying to cleanse them. What we're trying to do is add on top of them, okay? We're going to refurbish an old house, not tear the old house down. You can't do that, right?

**Speaker A:** Because that's what I did yoga. They sort of talked about burning them up. Getting rid of them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all you can't do that, but what you can do is change this moment. You can burn that stuff up as it's happening and say, no, we're going to change that right now. We're going to get a new perception. And then that new perception is what we store away. And so you want to keep adding new stuff to it, new stuff to it, new stuff to it. That is wholesome. And pretty soon, all that pile of Samskara is covered with good wholesome thoughts, and you don't have to dig down to find any of the unwholesome crap that you used to was laying all over it. So this is the way that we do it, is that we're storing away new present data. This gives some good data to store away. Let's get some wholesome stuff. Let's get some nurturing stuff so you remember to nurture yourself rather than remembering to fuss at yourself, because the fussing is the old stuff. To start nurturing, to start saying everything's all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Stuff like, well, I'm glad I remembered, rather than, oh, it's really spotty, this memory. I'm glad I remembered right now, and then store that away. So next time you can come up, "Oh, I'm really glad I remembered." So when we practice wholesome, when we practice nurturing, that stores away in our memory so that we're more likely to find nurturing right there on top. But if we've been hollering at ourselves and beating ourselves up and surrendering and all that kind of stuff, then that's what's going to be right there on top.

**Speaker A:** And when we're remembering to— when we're remembering, we're remembering to look and make change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, to remember to make a change, unless it's really already good. But any thought that you have, you can improve. So let's get into an improvement model. Every thought that you have, you can slightly adjust the attitude. This is the wisdom, is to keep looking at it, keep changing it, keep investigating, or in a way, keep asking yourself questions as opposed to being in doubt. You see, being in doubt is being confused. It's not looking It's worried because you don't understand. But a better way of talking about it is to become curious. There's a big difference between doubt and curiosity. Doubt don't feel good. Curiosity feels good. It's like adding sugar to doubt and it becomes curiosity. And then we want to look.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, how am I making a mess out of myself right now?

**Speaker B:** Well, make it a happy mess. Enjoy making a mess. Rather than having rules about what kind of mess it's supposed to be, you can just enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, those rules are stifling. It feels like 'Well, if I don't pin this thing down and get a grasp on this thing called life, it's going to crush me.' You know, I need to go out and put my will on it.

**Speaker B:** Or— exactly. And that's a really unwholesome thought. A better thought would be, it's not crushing me right now. The crushing is always off into the future. If you don't get a hold of that— that's the rule— if you don't get a hold of that, then you're going to get punished. And the answer is, well, I'm not being punished right now. And when you say I'm not being punished right now, you've already made the change. You've already come out of, oh, if you don't do that, you're going to get crushed, into I'm not crushed. This is why we want to make it good in the beginning. If you can make it good in the beginning over and over again, it's going to get good in the middle. And if you keep doing it, then it's going to be good when it ends, wherever that is. Or maybe it just ends right now because you got it. And then next time it comes up, well, let's make it good when it comes up. This is not a hard practice. All we have to do is remember to have insight into, oh, I could change this.

**Speaker A:** And that's what real insight is. It's not this Vipassana trying to break down the fabric of reality or whatever, right?

**Speaker B:** It's to see that this is Dukkha. Let's make a change. Then in fact, you've probably heard my little story about you're walking down the sidewalk and there right in front of you is a dog pile.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** What are we going to do with that dog pile? Well, the Vajrayana meditation, the choiceless awareness, is go ahead and step in that dog pile. Anapanasati is, oh, I see that dog pile, I'm going to step around it. But Vipassana is, oh, that's a dog pile, let's scoop it up, take it into the kitchen and check it out. Let's cut it up, dice it up, taste it, smell it, scrub it all over our face, eat it. That's what Vipassana is, and the right way to look at it is, "No, just get out of its way," if you can see it. So when you see the word "surrender," you can say, "Oh, that's a pile of dog pie," and just get right out of its way. No need for a lot of psychological archaeology at all. You see it and move away.

**Speaker A:** Do you think you can briefly cover Anapanasati again?

**Speaker B:** Well, we haven't really covered it in detail, but you can see that Anapanasati is very closely related to and is in fact a method of practicing the Eightfold Noble Path. So step 9 of Anapanasati is actually doing the investigation to really look at what the mind is doing, look at the attitude. In fact, you could call it, instead of looking at the thoughts themselves, look at the attitude that we have about the thoughts that we're having. So that you can change your attitude. In the language of the translations, it's called the state of mind. The state of mind that you have will influence the kind of thoughts that you have. So you can actually investigate the state of mind, and you can change that. And how the Anapanasati Sutra talks about it, is to gladden the mind-state, to gladden it up, and then further, to integrate that mind-state, make it whole. And then, that gives the mind freedom. But the first thing is to investigate what kind of mind-state that we have. All right, and then once we gladden the mind and gladden the mind state, that gives us the ability through the language that we're using to also begin to change the way that we feel. And the way that we're going to feel, the kind of language that we would use is, I feel safe, I feel secure, I feel comfortable, and I feel satisfied. This is the item that I think it's like number 8 on the list of Anapanasati, and it's called Sukkha, to train the mind into Sukkha, to train our feelings so that we feel comfortable. We use words like satisfied, and then there is an actual feeling of satisfied. And it has also the quality of relaxation. If you keep doing that over and over and over again, then confidence will grow. And then we add the next ingredient on the Eightfold Noble Path, which in the Anapanasati Sutta is referred to as Piti, or that wow sensation that comes from the feeling of I've got this. I can do this, I'm the boss here, I don't have to surrender, we can just call it off, my choice. And with the body, we start using the breathing, so that we can breathe with these things. Then we check the body out for any anxieties and whatnot like that, breathe them, and then we wind up with the body being relaxed.

**Speaker A:** Right, so that's just a general mindfulness of what the body's doing. Right then, is that just a general mindfulness of what the body's doing?

**Speaker B:** Yes, so that you can relax it. You keep watching what the body is doing, finding any tensions there, and just relaxing that. Coming back with the thoughts of, I feel good, I feel relaxed, everything is okay, no problem. And as we get into that state, then we can begin to see how fast the mind is changing. Everything is changing. Anicca— everything is in motion, everything is in flux. There's no reason to try to grab a hold of any particular thing. But when the mind is already in a wholesome, gladdened state, the kind of thoughts that you're going to have are glad and wholesome, happy thoughts. That's the wisdom. The wisdom is to know that you've got control over the kind of thoughts you're going to have, and those are the kind of thoughts that you have. The ignorance comes in is when you don't like the thoughts that you're having, you don't like the way things are going, and the Anicca, because we're ignorant of the fact that we've got choices. And we work ourselves up into a mess. And we wind up feeling bad, rather than actually changing and taking the choice that you can change. So that's Anapanasati right there in a nutshell. All based upon the Eightfold Noble Path.

**Speaker A:** And the way it's laid out in the suttas, it's not— that's not necessarily in order, is it?

**Speaker B:** No, you don't practice it in order. In fact, that's one of the major problems that people have had, is they think that that's, uh, instead of a collection of, um, objects, that they think that it's a chronological order. That in fact, if there is a chronological order, Sati comes first, investigation comes second, and then the effort. Then you keep practicing, that effort becomes energetic. And then the next one is the happiness, the Sukkha, the Piti, the Piti-Sukkha. And from that comes the relaxation.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And then from that becomes the unification of mind, and then from that becomes everything is hunky-dory, the balance. You can handle anything. Dynamic balance, not a static balance, but a dynamic balance.

**Speaker A:** So is the practice more like a big symphony of moving parts in a way?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a symphony of moving parts. Don't think that one's more important than the other. But Sati comes first. If you can't remember to look, you can't see. And if you see it, then you have a choice of making a change to it. And then you can congratulate yourself for making that change. And you can feel really good about that. That's step 4 of the Sambhojana, the factors of awakening. When you get that way over and over again, the mind becomes whole, it becomes unified. The parent and the child no longer have an argument. The mind is unified in wisdom.

**Speaker A:** And that's the whole path, do you think?

**Speaker B:** That's the whole path, but it is, uh, it's not really a path, it's more of a method. It's what you do right now, right? And when you keep coming back to mindfulness, you keep coming back to, uh, investigation, you keep coming back to making the change. You keep coming back to being happy, joyful. You keep coming back to being relaxed. You keep coming back to integration. And you keep coming back then to, uh, I can handle anything, dynamic balance. Nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** All right, what's to be said for all these things like cessations then and formless realms and whatnot?

**Speaker B:** I wouldn't worry about any of that kind of stuff. I would say that those are the kind of things that people make up because they're wanting something. Stop wanting stuff and be happy the way that you are. If you're happy, you're cool. That's Nibbana. If everything is lightweight, then you're already enlightened. No need to want something special. That all comes out of culture. That's actually what you would call mundane, the mundane Dharma. The magical powers, magical thinking, magical states, magical enlightenment, magical Nibbana, and all of that kind of stuff. And we could come away from that low-class ordinary way of thinking into a very high-class way of thinking, like, I don't give a rip, I'm okay, no problem.

**Speaker A:** I think I heard you say somewhere, didn't you say in Thailand they sort of give the kids the magical Buddhism until they're old enough to— well, that's.

**Speaker B:** All they can handle. Right, that's all that they can handle. But kids don't have wisdom, so you give them rules. You give them Sila first—Sila, Samatha, Pañña. But once you have the Pañña, then the Sila becomes natural, because if you don't want anything, you're unlikely to kill somebody to get it. So our path, the noble path, is Panna, Samadhi, Sila. With wisdom, we get the mind integrated and whole, and when the mind is integrated and whole and noble, our Sila is okay. People have already gotten all too many rules. The Noble Path is to finish with the rules. The Pali word for that is Silabatta Paramasa, and it's actually the second fetter. The first fetter is personality view of my, me, and mine. The second fetter is the eradication of attachments to rules and wanting to get it right, and just let everything be okay already. You're already enlightened, you're already okay. Nurture yourself. And with that then comes the eradication of doubt, most specifically the eradication of doubt about what's the right way to live, what is our method. And so we know the Eightfold Noble Method, the Eightfold Noble Path, is the way to live this moment, moment by moment, and it becomes a lifestyle. That's all there is to it. Moment by moment, you keep doing it right over and over again, then you've got a lifestyle. Because we've got a method. And so that then winds up being the eradication of doubt about what is and what is not the path. What is not the path, by the way, is all of that ordinary stuff that that you were talking about. Attainments, getting something, wanting something, working hard and getting it, and then find out it ain't as good as you wanted and you wanted something better— that's all ordinary stuff. But if we're practicing correctly, then we become satisfied. I'm just good. I don't need all of that magical thinking. I don't need magical powers. I don't need to know if there's rebirth and reincarnation. But I'm happy right now. I don't care whether it's that way or this way or whatever in the future, because right now we don't know. But for the kids, we've got to tell them, oh, if you go and do this, that, and the other thing, you're going to get hit with it someday, sometime. You may be dead, we're still going to find a way to get to you and punish you. So that's an ordinary kind of teaching. The supermundane teaching is, hey man, when you feel really good, you don't hurt people. You become integrated and whole, so you don't need something from the outside.

**Speaker A:** You said the wisdom leads to correct morality, and could the wisdom be summarized as just Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Just see where you're creating suffering and then stop doing that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when you don't feel bad, you don't want anything, you're unlikely to go hurt somebody or do something bad or wrong if you already feel good. It's really very simple, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just what I kind of had to clarify. It feels a bit so simple.

**Speaker B:** It's very simple, and it's simple right now, and it's going to be simple a minute from now, and it's going to be simple an hour from now, and it's going to be simple for a day from now. Do you have the confidence to see that it's very simple? It's going to be simple in the future. Everything is okay. So why don't we finish the call? I think that we've gotten it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, so call me back. We'll continue on with it because this is so subtle that people forget.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, strange.

**Speaker B:** Callum, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Okay, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student (Speaker A), focuses on the practical psychology of Buddhist practice, moving away from abstract doctrine to direct mental training. Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: From Victim to Champion
The central instruction is to shift from a mindset of **surrender** (seen as victimhood) to one of **active, skillful management** of your own mind. The practice is about seeing unwholesome thoughts and attitudes and consciously replacing them with wholesome ones.

### Main Instructions & Insights:

1.  **Watch Your Language:** Pay close attention to the words you use internally (e.g., "my practice is *sporadic*" vs. "*I remembered!*"). Language shapes perception and feeling. Victim-language reinforces suffering; nurturing language builds well-being.
2.  **Change the Attitude, Not Just Thoughts:** The key is to catch the **leaning** or **attitude** of the mind *before* it forms into full-blown unwholesome thoughts. This "leaning" is what you can change.
3.  **Nurture Yourself:** Reprogram the internal "parent" voice from being critical and demanding to being nurturing and accepting. The message is: "You are already okay, lovable, and don't need to *do* anything to earn that."
4.  **It's About Addition, Not Subtraction:** You don't need to dig up and destroy old negative patterns (Samskaras). Instead, continually generate and store new wholesome perceptions, feelings, and memories. Over time, these wholesome layers cover the old unwholesome ones.
5.  **Insight is Practical:** True insight (Vipassana) is not an intellectual analysis of reality, but the simple, clear seeing that "this thought/attitude is causing suffering (Dukkha), so I can change it." He uses the analogy: if you see a dog pile on the path, the wise move is to step around it, not analyze it.
6.  **Anapanasati in Essence:** The practice of mindfulness of breathing is presented as a method to enact the Noble Eightfold Path. It involves:
    *   **Sati (Mindfulness):** Remembering to look.
    *   **Investigation:** Seeing the mind-state and attitude.
    *   **Effort:** Gladdening the mind, changing the attitude to a wholesome one.
    *   **Result:** Cultivating feelings of joy (Piti), contentment (Sukkha), relaxation, and ultimately a unified, dynamically balanced mind.
    *   It's a **symphony of moving parts**, not a rigid linear sequence.
7.  **The Path is a Simple, Present-Moment Method:** The goal is not to attain magical states, cessations, or formless realms. That is "mundane Dharma" or "magical thinking." The "supermundane" path is about being happy and satisfied *now*. When you feel good, wholesome morality (Sila) flows naturally. The fetter of clinging to rules and rituals is released.
8.  **Wisdom Summarized:** The essence of wisdom is seeing where you are creating suffering and stopping it. When you don't feel bad, you don't crave, and you're unlikely to act unskillfully. **"If you're happy, you're cool. That's Nibbana."**

### Key Metaphors:
*   **The Falling Tree:** The mind's *attitude* is the lean of the tree before it falls. Change the lean, change where it falls.
*   **Refurbishing a House:** You don't tear down old mental patterns; you renovate by adding new, wholesome layers on top.
*   **Dog Pile on the Path:** Insight is seeing the source of suffering and simply avoiding it, not obsessively analyzing it.

### Conclusion:
The entire talk emphasizes a **simple, confident, and self-empowering approach**. The path is a moment-to-moment lifestyle of remembering, investigating, gladdening the mind, and nurturing oneself. Enlightenment is reframed as the freedom and ease that come from letting go of the inner war, dropping the victim mentality, and realizing you are already okay.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate his points about mindfulness, attitude, and mental training. Here are the key ones:

### **1. The Tree Falling (Direction of the Mind)**
*   **Metaphor:** A tree being cut down.
*   **Purpose:** To explain the subtle, formative stage of thoughts (attitude/leaning) before they become full-blown thoughts (the tree falling).
*   **Quote:** *"when a tree is cut down and felled, which direction is it going to fall in?... the tree actually has to lean in that direction before it falls. This is what I'm talking about, is the attitude is the leaning, not the full thought form... watch the fact that the mind leans before it falls."*

### **2. The Dog Pile on the Sidewalk (Different Meditation Approaches)**
*   **Story/Analogy:** Encountering dog excrement on a sidewalk.
*   **Purpose:** To contrast different meditation styles and advocate for the simple, pragmatic approach of *Anapanasati*.
    *   **Vajrayana / Choiceless Awareness:** Step in the dog pile (face everything directly, even the unpleasant).
    *   **Anapanasati:** See the dog pile and step around it (recognize unwholesome thoughts and avoid them).
    *   **Vipassana (as he criticizes it):** Scoop it up, analyze it, taste it (over-analyze and dwell on negative mental content).
*   **Quote:** *"the right way to look at it is, 'No, just get out of its way,' if you can see it. So when you see the word 'surrender,' you can say, 'Oh, that's a pile of dog pie,' and just get right out of its way."*

### **3. Refurbishing an Old House (Working with Samskaras)**
*   **Metaphor:** An old house.
*   **Purpose:** To explain how to deal with past mental impressions (*samskaras*). The goal is not to demolish the old house (erase past conditioning) but to **refurbish it** by adding new, wholesome material on top.
*   **Quote:** *"We're going to refurbish an old house, not tear the old house down... you want to keep adding new stuff to it... all that pile of Samskara is covered with good wholesome thoughts, and you don't have to dig down to find any of the unwholesome crap."*

### **4. The Broken Arm (Active Care vs. Passive Surrender)**
*   **Metaphor/Scenario:** Having a broken arm.
*   **Purpose:** To challenge the concept of "surrender" and replace it with active, champion-like care.
    *   **Surrender/Passive Attitude:** "Oh, poor me, I have to accept/surrender to this broken arm." (Leads to slow healing).
    *   **Champion/Active Attitude:** "I've got a broken arm. I'm going to take care of it, put it in a sling, and it's going to heal."
*   **Quote:** *"It's going to take a long time for the arm to heal with that attitude. A much better attitude was, 'Oh, I've got a broken arm. I'm going to make sure... I'm going to take care of it'"*

### **5. The Camera vs. The Human Mind (Perception)**
*   **Metaphor:** A camera recording a scene.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how human perception is not neutral but is a creative act based on past conditioning (*samskaras*). Unlike a camera, we "make stuff up" based on recognition from our past.
*   **Quote:** *"A camera can catch a scene... Humans don't have scenes that can be recorded like a camera. Their eyes always go through a processing mechanism... we make stuff up, and we make it up out of our past."*

### **6. Internal War & Making Friends (Psychology of the Mind)**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** An internal war, using psychological frameworks (Freud's superego/id, Eric Berne's Parent-Adult-Child).
*   **Purpose:** To describe inner conflict and the path to resolution. The goal is not to win the war or surrender, but to **call it off** and make the inner "parent" (critical authority) and "child" (spontaneous self) into **friends** by changing the parent's voice from critical to nurturing.
*   **Quote:** *"Are you going to surrender to that war? Are you going to call the war off?... we're going to call that off and we're going to make friends out of it... the parent and the child, can become friends... the parent can come out of its critical thinking into nurturing thinking."*

### **7. Adding Sugar to Doubt (Doubt vs. Curiosity)**
*   **Metaphor:** Adding sugar to a substance.
*   **Purpose:** To transform a negative mental state (doubt) into a positive one (curiosity). Doubt is confused and feels bad; curiosity is investigative and feels good.
*   **Quote:** *"There's a big difference between doubt and curiosity. Doubt don't feel good. Curiosity feels good. It's like adding sugar to doubt and it becomes curiosity."*

### **8. Symphony of Moving Parts (The Practice)**
*   **Metaphor:** A symphony.
*   **Purpose:** To describe the practice of *Anapanasati* and the Noble Eightfold Path not as a rigid, linear sequence, but as a dynamic, interconnected set of factors that work together harmoniously.
*   **Quote:** *"So is the practice more like a big symphony of moving parts in a way? — Yeah, it's a symphony of moving parts."*

### **Key Thematic Contrasts (Implied Metaphors):**
*   **Champion vs. Victim:** A running theme where the listener is encouraged to be the "champion" of their mind, not a "victim" who surrenders.
*   **Magical vs. Mundane/Supermundane Dharma:** Contrasts "magical thinking" about attainments and powers (for "kids" or beginners) with the "supermundane" teaching of being satisfied and happy right now with simple wisdom.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of a pragmatic, psychological, and empowering approach to Buddhist practice, emphasizing present-moment choice, nurturing self-talk, and the simple recognition and replacement of unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones.
