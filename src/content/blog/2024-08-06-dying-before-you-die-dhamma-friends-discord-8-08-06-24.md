### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This is the Monday Dhamma Friends Discord Hangout, and a couple of questions have come up. The first was about having a desire to be in the present moment. I think it was Edward asked if it's better to have a strong desire to be present, and he said that in his experience, he feels like he's more present when he has a strong desire to be present. And then Santiago asked a question as well, which is, you know, if you have a mind that is unmoved by happiness and sorrow, we could add the other— that's two of the eight worldly winds you mentioned. So if the mind is unmoved by happiness and sorrow, or any of the other six worldly winds, let's say praise and blame, fame and disrepute. And then what's the other one? Gain and loss. Yeah, if you have a mind that's completely unmoved by these things, although Santiago's question was specifically about happiness and sorrow, then what is that state like? What's a state that is unmovable by these feelings of happiness and sadness? What is that like? So that's an interesting question as well. So I'll start with Edward's question, which is a strong desire to be in the present moment. You know, my intuitive response to that, being sort of a long time involved with Dhamma, is that it's a bit of a contradiction in terms. I don't doubt that when you say that you feel more present when you have a strong desire to be present, that works. So maybe there's something that I can clarify in my mind while I'm thinking out loud here. But my intuitive response would be that if you look at the Buddhist teaching on dependent origination, or if you follow the gradual training, which starts with traditionally sense restraint, I like to say that what we do here is sense restraint. When we choose to be satisfied, we are restraining the mind from chasing after the pleasures and running away from the displeasures that are associated with the senses. When normally we're, you know, wanting to be stimulated in a positive way, wanting to get rid of being stimulated in a negative way, and that desire is deluding us into seeing things as permanent, seeing things as pleasing, seeing things as satisfying and whatnot. And here we practice being satisfied with things exactly as they are, not as permission to chase every desire we have, but as permission to let those desires go and just be happy with it, with or without whatever is present in our experience. So that connects pretty directly to Edward's question. To make the mind fully present, gathered together, unified in this moment, in this reality, it needs to be without desire, needs to be desireless. There's different ways of talking about how the mind is divided. I could talk about it in technical ways, but I'm going to use sort of Dhammarato's framework for this, at least how I like to understand it. Pretty much every moment of our life where the mind is divided into several different pieces. And the Buddha talks about wild animals pulling the mind in different directions. But the way that Dhammarato talks about it in modern terms is that we're pretty much always being pulled in one direction by what we want. Or let's say there's a relationship, a toxic, high-conflict relationship between what we want what we think should be, and the way things actually are. And every once in a while in life, by some magic, those three things might come together, right? What you want, the way you think things should be, and the way things actually are might come together, and your desire will come to extinction right there. And you'll experience this bliss of desirelessness that the Buddha is talking about, what we call satisfaction. But 99.999% of the time, what we want, what we think, the way that we think things should be and the way things actually are, are not in alignment, right? So let's say simple example is we want to make our bodies fit and beautiful by conventional standards, because that's self-perception. But let's say we want to make our bodies conventionally lean and fit or whatever. And we, but we really want to eat lots and lots of pasta at 9:00 at night. I don't know. And we think that if we want to be fit, then we shouldn't be eating that pasta.

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** This is just the best example I can come up with right now. So, you know, our desire to be, or the thought that we should be fit and healthy, or the desire to be fit and healthy is conflicting with the desire to eat the pasta. We should— we think either we should eat the pasta or we shouldn't eat the pasta. We want to be fit or we don't want to be fit. They're just kind of pulling against each other, right? And then, but the way things actually are is that, you know, there's just this body, and, and then there's food. And we can take the Buddha's advice and give the body just enough food in order to support the spiritual life, is what he says. We shouldn't think of food as pleasurable or unpleasurable. We can enjoy the taste of it. We shouldn't think of it as for the purpose of making the body beautiful. We shouldn't think of it— I'm using "shoulds" here, but in this context I think it's okay— that, you know, we should just see food as food and as energy to support the spiritual life. So the reality is that this body needs to eat and we need to feed it, and we don't need to overfeed it and make it feel uncomfortable. We don't need to add all the emotional proliferation, whatnot. So, you know, that's just one example of wants and shoulds and reality coming against each other. And what creates that division is desire, right? So there's different orders you can look at the relationship of the Kilesas, what's called the Kilesas. They're the three sort of expressions of craving: greed, hatred, and delusion. Sometimes they're articulated as Mara's daughters, right? So Mara, rules the realm of sensuality, which is the realm of desire in regard to the senses. And Mara's daughters are greed, hatred, and delusion, Marga, or lobha, dosa, and moha. And so there's different ways we could think about how these kilesas work with each other. Oftentimes we think of delusion as most primary, and greed and hatred sort of being a result of delusion. But there's one way I've been thinking about the past couple of days, which is that desire is really the root, right? So, you know, the Buddha teaches us that all conditioned things are unsatisfying, or they're impermanent, they're unsatisfying, and they are unownable. They're not me or mine. But when we want something, we see things that are see things that are not permanent as permanent. We see things that are not satisfying as satisfying. And we see things that are not me and mine as me and mine. So that's all delusion, right? That's seeing the opposite of the three characteristics, seeing things that are impermanent as permanent, seeing things that are unsatisfying as satisfying, seeing things that are not me and mine as me and mine. That's all delusion. But it's our desire for an object that deludes us into seeing them as permanent, satisfying, and ownable. Right, or controllable or possessible. And, you know, and then of course anything that comes into conflict with that desired object results in a feeling of hatred, right? So the example here might be like, let's say you were a teenager or you're a parent with a teenage son or daughter, and that son or daughter has a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever, some partner that they desire, and they think that this person is like perfect and beautiful, the love of their life. The love is going to be everlasting. There's never going to be any problems. It's always going to be perfect and beautiful. And but you can, you know, you know, from your experience, there's exceptions to this that you know, these things tend to be impermanent, they tend to be changeful, they tend to be unsatisfying. The desire itself changes, the people change, everything changes. And, you know, even the sense of desire that people have towards each other is what creates the sense of ownership, right? So it might start out beautiful in the beginning, but then people tend to want to possess each other, then that creates more toxicity. So you can see how like desire is sort of the forerunner of like the seeing permanence, seeing satisfactoryness, and seeing ownability in objects of the senses. So this is how the mind gets conditioned throughout our lives to constantly fool itself into thinking that this next thing, this next person, this next experience is going to be the thing that makes me happy. So this is our perpetual state of dissatisfaction. We're in this cycle of dissatisfaction driven by, you know, greed, hatred, and delusion, these three forms of desire. And so that we can't really be present when desire is present necessarily. For that reason, it's what creates past, it's what creates future, it's what creates good and bad, it's what creates beautiful and ugly, it's what creates you know, the sense of me that's implicated by praise and blame. So it creates a sense of deluded happiness that we think we're going to get from gain, that we lament from loss. It's what creates all of our vulnerability, our liability to these 8 worldly winds that the Buddha talks about. It's what creates this whole mass of suffering, essentially. Before I get to conclude on this point here, the sort of the technical, the sort of direct perception, you can say, of dependent origination, if you look at it directly in experience, you know, the Buddha tells us that these experiences constituted by these five domains he calls the khandhas, the domain of the body, of physicality, of solidity, cohesion, movement, and heat. Or temperature is another way it's broken down. That's the domain of physicality, the rupa khanda. Then there's the domain of Vedana khanda, which is the tone of feeling that arises at the sense doors that's felt as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. That goes for what we see, hear, taste, touch, and feel. You know, there's the domain of perception, the domain of thinking, and the domain of consciousness. And this is what constitutes our experience. And this is all just nature, essentially. This is just a way of breaking down nature. Although the Buddha doesn't make any assumption outside of experience, he doesn't make a claim that this nature is objectively physical. He doesn't make any claims that this nature is objectively mental. He doesn't make any claims of any metaphysical assumption beyond experience itself. These five domains of experience, these khandhas, These are just the way we experience in the world. He calls it the all, he calls it the world, he calls it the cosmos. This is all we can know. There's nothing outside of it. These domains of experience, these are fine. These are empty of self, empty of meaning or value, not in a negative or depressing way, just in a factual way. And what makes these domains of experience suffering is in the unfolding of dependent origination is the arising of Tanha, which is that ignorant craving. And the actual experience of Tanha is clinically what we call emotion in modern terms, not emotion in the broader sense that we normally use the word emotion that includes a broader spectrum of feeling. But this very sort of unconscious evolutionary programming of drives arising in order to pressure us towards certain things and pull us away from other things. And when emotion arises in response to the five khandhas, it creates that feeling of possession. And that feeling of possession is what then creates the sense of me. That's the Bhavana, the sense of existence. And then that Bhavana is expressed in action, and that's what's referred to as birth in Buddhism. And as soon as that happens, that's when we experience that's when the self that is born looks to the khandhas for what if this, if there is this feeling of me, what am I? And the one thing that is taking up, taking presence in the perception of space and time is the physical body. So it takes the physical body up as me and mine. And as soon as the physical body is assumed as me and mine, time, time is born. So there's a past, which is birth. There's a future, which is death. And the present, which is aging. So we have a past when we were born, we have a future when we'll die, and we have a present, which is aging. So this is how the possession of the khandhas, the Upadana khandhas, he calls it, give forth to this whole mass of suffering. It's all rooted in desire, essentially. And so desire is really, really the thing to be aware of at all times. You know, whenever there's suffering, you have to say, what is it that I'm wanting? You know, or you can just remind yourself that there's nothing to want, right? Everything is okay exactly as it is. There are some things I have influence over, but for the most part, this is just, this is just a perfectly harmonious process of nature unfolding on its own. There's nothing I need to do. It's not incomplete. It doesn't need— there's nothing missing except the realization that nothing is missing, right? That's one way I like to articulate the Third Noble Truth, the realization that nothing is missing, the bliss of being without, being okay being without. So anyway, I'm not going to go on and on about that too much longer, but Just to summarize my response to Edward's question is that what you might be experiencing when you feel more present, desiring the present, is this little mental hack that I think Dhammarato has expressed, which is he once said, you know, wanting things we don't have is painful, so we need to stop wanting. And then he said, or better yet, more wisely, he said, we could want things that are freely available. So we've spent our entire lives identified with desire. We are desire itself. So we can sort of just use that to bring us to the present moment. We can want what's not the present moment, right? Because that's a concept in our mind, but like something actual in the present moment, like this next breath, right? We can say, I want this breath right now. And be fully satisfied with this breath, or I want to be sitting in this chair talking to my friends on Discord right now. So then my desire is already satisfied the moment it's born. I like to think of it as like when they use a backburner in a wildfire situation, they'll light another fire, and then the two fires come together, they extinguish each other. So desire is a fire. And then the desire for what's freely available right now is the backburner, and then they come together and extinguish. So that might be maybe what you're experiencing, Edward, when you desire this present moment, as long as this present moment is actual, not conceptual. And before I go on to the other question, I just want to invite anybody else to add to that topic or ask a connected question or whatever you want to do.

**Speaker C:** I'm just— I'm okay. So I'm trying to figure out— it seems like you want to just not take too many steps and just go straight from Dukkha to just being satisfied. I think that's a good Like, it's definitely something I need to actually practice more, but I think I've been doing things in like steps. Like, I'll have a strong desire to be present, and then that way I will find a way to be present by letting go of seeing things differently. So I'll just see things the way they are. And then I'll experience sort of satisfaction. So it's sort of like, it seems like more steps than you're explaining, but I don't know if you see that as like a method that could work, or if you think that it's better to just go straight from sort of seeing the desire to be present, but then just going straight to, oh yeah, well, everything's okay. So like, even if you aren't present enough to see everything's okay, just like believing it. Like, because I sort of see a difference between fully believing something and actually being aware of what's going on, and then really deep down knowing it. So like, if you actually have the desire to really look and know it for yourself, then I feel like it has a stronger effect than just going straight to like, oh yeah, I think everything's okay. I know it's okay because in the past I knew it was okay. So now it's obviously okay, even though I'm not actually really paying attention.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I get what you're saying. There is a way that this phrase, everything is okay, Anagami can be sort of a deluded thought. But, you know, Dhammarato is really good at navigating people's psychology into seeing the truth of that. So that's not my skill. So I'm not really going to try to convince people of that. But what I can say is that It's a matter of sort of undoing the tangled narratives that you've been living in your whole life that have been convincing you things aren't okay. And this is just a way of speaking about the same Dhamma that the Buddha taught, right? I mean, greed, hatred, and delusion, you know, lobha, dosa, moha, they're like little Rumpelstiltskins spinning yarns all the time. They're creating narratives in the mind, and each of these storylines have their own characters, and each of these characters are our different selves that we are, and these selves are born to live out the pursuit of different desires that are part of these narratives, right? So this is what existence is. There are these storylines. Carl Jung talked about this in similar ways. He called the ego a complex. It's within the broader consciousness. He used the capital S Self. Of course, but he talked about the mind as being very, very broad, much broader and bigger than what we normally identify with in our thinking. And in a similar way, that is experienced in the Dhamma. And but these complexes that he talked about are similar to what is called self in Buddhism. I like to think of them as narratives. So the point I'm making here in response to what you're saying is that we have narratives of dissatisfaction. Dhammarato says it simply. He says we've been talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives. So now we're going to talk ourselves into feeling good. That's the wholesome thoughts, right? We've been having unwholesome thoughts. Thoughts of dissatisfaction are unwholesome thoughts. Thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future, thoughts about what we want. What we want to be different, what we don't want, thoughts about the way things should be instead of the way things are. Those are all examples of unwholesome thoughts. These are all thoughts of dissatisfaction. These are all thoughts that keep us out of harmony with the way things are, off-balanced, always leaning, falling back to the past, or leaning towards the future, or feeling sort of dizzy about what is right now, feeling very unclear and muddy about the present moment. And these are all emotionally charged, meaning-laden, value-laden, opinion-laden stories that are going on in our minds. That's why the Buddha says, you know, go to an empty hut, go to the root of a tree, seek solitude, essentially get away from all of these contexts for different selves that we are to arise, right? And I, you know, I use the example of solitary confinement once. I'm not going to go there. But, you know, the reason that, let's say, Bodhidharma brought the practice of wall gazing to China is because when you're in a cave staring at a wall, there's nothing there. But these narratives that we live in and as, they fuel themselves, right? Upadana are our fuels. So you have to untangle these narratives that tell you all the reasons why it's not okay to just be okay with the way things are right now. And so if you're just sort of adding a little counter-narrative to that whole mess of stories telling you things are okay, and it's like all the things I should be doing, all the things I want to be doing, all the reasons why I'm not okay, thousands and thousands of storylines going on, and then you're just told, just think things are okay exactly as they are. You just have this little tiny, you know, one wholesome thought being thrown into the mix of all those others. It's going to be overwhelmed, essentially. It's like, you know, sending a happy ninja into a crowd of angry samurai. I don't know. And, uh, you know, and the way Dhammarato teaches is like, okay, you just keep cultivating wholesome thoughts, keep until the mind is so filled with wholesome thoughts that it overwhelms all of that, all of those patterns of negativity you develop your whole lives. And he uses the example of even if your mind is a sewer, if you put, you know, if you think of a wholesome thought as like a hamburger and you keep layering it on top of the sewer instead of cleaning out the sewer, let's say, eventually you're going to have a stack of hamburgers so high that like the top 10 feet are all edible, you know. Even if the bottom is still in the sewer. But the other way to go about it is the more, I guess, traditional way to go about it. Well, I mean, it's that. That is the traditional way to go about it because that's noble right effort, right? But that's in combination with removing the fuels. So you want to abandon all the unwholesome stuff. This is the noble right effort. Abandon unwholesome thoughts, you know, prevent the re-arising of unwholesome thoughts. So that's the first and second noble right effort. Cultivate wholesome thoughts, and then sustain those cultivated wholesome thoughts. So you're basically reprogramming the mind, and that's done in the context of sense restraint in the traditional sense of detoxing the mind from its addiction to, you know, doing things based off of desire. As long as you are doing things to get things or doing things to feel better than you do, you're fueling the agent of the matrix, as like the architect of the matrix, desire, right? You're fueling it. Even when you're doing things or getting things to make you feel better than you do in a seemingly wholesome way, you're still fueling the habit of not being okay with the way things are and seeking things outside of the mind itself in order to be satisfied. I mentioned last time, I think, Ajahn Mun's articulation of the Four Noble Truths was the mind going outside of itself is suffering, and the mind not going— or sorry, the mind going outside of itself is the cause of suffering. The mind having gone outside of itself is suffering. The mind staying within itself is the end of suffering. And the mind remaining within the mind is, you know, the way leading to the end of suffering. So what Ajahn Panna is expressing is that the mind— first of all, what would you normally think of when I say the mind is not the mind, right? We have taken thoughts, perceptions, things like that to be what the mind is, but these are just activities of the mind. It's not the mind itself, right? We've taken the Kilesa to be the mind— greed, hatred, delusion. We've taken the body to be the self, which is just a mental image that the mind constructs. But the mind is sort of the totality of experience. Is the best way I can put it at the moment. And it fragments itself because it's constantly seeking something outside of itself, because it can't really see itself, right? Mind can't see itself. And actually, the mind coming to know itself is part of that change of lineage that's talked about in the suttas. They call it the, you know, the Citta Nimitta, seeing the sign of the mind. You begin to discern where sort of the mind's own nature is distinct from the things that it creates, essentially. But when we tell ourselves that the purpose of saying everything is okay exactly as it is, is not to create a delusion within a bunch of other delusions, It's to take a fire extinguisher to the fire of the craving that's in the form of things are not okay. I'll be okay when I get the job I want. I'll be okay when I get the car that I want. I'll be okay when I get rid of this thing that I don't like. These are all just, you know, fires and stories that are inside the mind. And when we say everything is okay exactly as it is, at least, you know, in this Sangha here, what we're trying to do is undermine that whole process, invite the mind back to rest within itself, and just to be at rest, essentially. Really, what the Dharma is about is about healing, right? Buddha Dasa used to talk about the kilesa as things that stab, right? Greed, hatred, and delusion. Are like little needles that we've been stabbing the mind with, or that have been stabbing the mind, you know, for eons, endless expansions and contractions of the universe. Or we can just think of as far back as we can remember, beginningless time, we've been stabbing the mind with dissatisfaction. You know, just, it's painful when you think about it. When you think back on whatever age you are now, I'll use my age, 37 years old, 37 years, how much of that time has been spent not satisfied? How much of that time has been spent dissatisfied, judging, wanting, hating, irritated, missing things, not taking in the fullness of experience because the mind is blurry with thoughts or trying to get to something else? Trying to get away from something, stuck in, you know, imagination, whatever. How long have we been thinking, saying, and doing things that are just injuring the mind, right? And then doing other things to cover up the pain that we cause ourselves from this diluted mess of constantly wanting things we don't have, constantly being dissatisfied with the way things are. And, you know, the Dhamma is just telling us to just stop all of that so that we can just let the mind rest. The Kilesas are still going to be in there. Greed, hatred, and delusion are still going to be in there running around telling us what to do. They're like, know exactly what to say to us to make us fall into their narratives. And but if we can stop and just sort of be okay with the habits of bad feelings that will continue to come up to pressure us to go and do things, right? So to entertain ourselves, to distract ourselves, to get away from the way we feel. That's just continually to— that's a continued self-abuse, you can think of it as. So the analogy that's pretty common is you could think of the mind as being like an open wound, and it itches, and we're scratching it and scratching and scratching it. We're scratching it with greed, we're scratching with hatred, scratching it with delusion, we're scratching with judgment, scratching it with dissatisfaction. We're, you know, scratching it by taking personal the things people say. We're scratching it by, you know, holding on to gain and lamenting over loss, and grasping at happiness and suffering over sorrow, and, you know, and all of these 8 worldly winds that the Buddha talks about. And when he talks about the unconditioned, he's not making a metaphysical claim. When the Buddha talks about the unconditioned, he's not making a metaphysical claim that there's some other place, some other thing some other mind, something apart from these five domains of experience that he calls the five aggregates. No, he's saying that the mind in its natural state, when it is not scratched up and poked and prodded and beaten by greed, hatred, and delusion, is perfectly peaceful, perfectly happy, perfectly healthy, and healed completely. The unconditioned is a completely healed mind, is what it is. And so a lot of the practice of the Dharma is about stopping, right? It's about not scratching, essentially. Well, you can think of all of the pressures of greed, hatred, and delusion as being like a desire to scratch an itch. But if you just don't scratch, and you just have enough, you know, faith and confidence from what you've seen, if you've taken the time to put the mind down and let it heal even just a little bit, right? You've convinced yourself that it's okay to put it down. It's okay to stop shaking the mind. It's okay to stop stimulating the mind. It's okay to stop being dissatisfied. Just put it down. Let it be. Let it rest. And you watch what it does. Just the tiny bit of relief that you get, if that's the first time you've done it, will feel like one of the most profound experiences you've had. Then, of course, the mistake we make is thinking that that feeling of relief that we get from putting the mind down for just a second is some magical experience that we then need to go and seek. And we could spend even the rest of our lives seeking that little bit of relief we got. It feels like a lot because we've never done it before. We could spend the rest of our lives chasing after that feeling of relief, thinking like we had some mystical experience, but it's just a bit of relief because we are punishing ourselves. We're hurting ourselves, you know.

**Speaker D:** We're.

**Speaker A:** We're scratching at the mind, essentially, just like Buddhadasa says. We're stabbing it, essentially. That's what's going on with greed, hatred, and delusion. One of the factors of— one of the markers of stream entry is this realization that I'm doing this to myself, you know. That, you know, Dhammarato talks about this, like, as going from being a victim to being a winner. That's what he's talking about. The victim's attitude is that, you know, oh, woe is me, you know, the world sucks, my upbringing sucks, the mind that I have sucks, you know. I was using myself as an example. I have ADHD, I can't focus, so hard to do Dharma practice with a brain that's ADHD or whatever, you know, all kinds of things, whatever external condition that you can blame for why like, here, you're dissatisfied. That's the victim's attitude, right? That's the attitude of a Puttujana in the suttalanguage. The thickster is what that means. And I think, you know, I thought about that, like, what is— why does the Buddha call ordinary people thicksters? Why? Because we're so swollen with stupidity that we can't see what's right in front of us. That's the only thing I could think of. What's right in front of us is that things are okay exactly as they are. We don't, you know, like enlightenment's not this thing at the end of a rainbow, you know. Liberation is not this thing at the end of a long path. It's right here in front of us through, you know, the door of seeing things in the right way, seeing things in the right way in terms of of what the antidotes are, which is Anicca, right? Seeing things as impermanent. The reason that impermanence is so healing is because it prevents the mind from grabbing on, and the mind is suffering from grabbing on, right? So it's like reality is this rope that's attached to an anchor on a speeding boat. So it's going really fast, and we're grabbing onto that rope, and we're getting this horrible rope burn. If we see that the rope is moving really fast, we won't grab onto it. That's what the perception of impermanence is effectively. It goes much deeper than that. You know, you got to bring impermanence deep, deep, deep into the heart. I won't get into all that right now, but if you bring impermanence, the deeper the perception of impermanence is, the more profound your experience of liberation will be. I'll just put it that way. It leads into the perception of the fact that all the things that we chase after are not going to satisfy it. We can't— you can't see anything as permanent. You can't see anything as satisfying. You can't see anything as ownable. When you can't see anything as permanent, satisfying, or ownable, the mind won't grasp and cling, and therefore it won't suffer. And then that's when the mind really starts to heal. This traditional idea of stream entry is when grasping and clinging really cease, but the mind still has some time to heal. It can take 7 lifetimes, apparently.

**Speaker C:** Okay, thanks. I appreciate you sharing your opinion.

**Speaker A:** Oops, sorry about that. So yeah, anybody else can still add to that. I still haven't gotten to Santiago's question, but it is what it is. I'm sending a text message. Okay, I'm done with that.

**Speaker D:** I have a question, but I feel like it's a bit unrelated to what you guys just talked about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, can I just check in with Santiago really quick just to see if any of what I said answered his question?

**Speaker B:** Or if I should— I'm learning a lot.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, I could go into it somewhat more specifically if you'd like. Yeah, that would be great. I would really appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. So just to make a long story short, Santiago, you were asking about not being moved by happiness or sorrow sounds like an emotionless state, even though you know that's not what it is. Well, you know, the bliss of the Dhamma is desirelessness. It is— it's described, you know, Nibbana has the characteristics of desirelessness, of emptiness, of signlessness. Meaning that Nibbana has no— like, the mind can't make an image out of Nibbana. Essentially, that's what silence is, in a way. Like, when you see a stop sign with the words S-T-O-P, it signifies to cease moving, right? But if you know, English isn't your language, then those words might not mean anything. But if you had to sign a stop sign with a hand up, then that would be a more universal sign for stop, right? So a sign is something that signifies something else. So Nibbana doesn't— uh, Nibbana doesn't have any point of reference in the domains of experience that we're used to. I won't get into that, but just one of the qualities of Anagami is signless. There's no representation of it in the mind, you can say. It's meaningless, basically, which when you say meaningless, it sounds like a negative thing, but that's just because we live our life in a meaningful way. So meaninglessness sounds bad, but it's not. And then it's said to be aimless, Nibbana. Said to be aimless. There's— because intention, Samskara, has come to cessation. And Nibbana is said to be desireless. So the reason that this sounds like an unpleasant experience— in fact, when the Buddha used to talk about Nibbana to some people from traditions that maybe weren't as adept in restraint and asceticism as some of his other people. Some people would pull their hair out, beat their chest, they'd become terrified. People committed suicide. Bhikkhuni said it awful, you know, it didn't sound great. And that's because the condition of human life is, you know, our desire is everything to us. You know, we are what we want. It's what creates all of our sense of meaning, what creates all of our sense of self in a very technical way. Independent origination, desire literally is what fabricates the entire world, the entire sense of self, and the entire relationship between the world and the sense of self. We're really, really, we really live in and as our desires. And that's why it's called dying before you die, essentially, because the structure that we take to be who and what we are is fabricated by desire. And, but so the reason that the Buddha chose to focus on Dukkha as the phenomena, because really what the Buddha was seeking was liberation, right? And he found that there wasn't a philosophical system that he could teach that would make people liberated, or a metaphysical teaching, because no matter what philosophy or metaphysics you deliver, it's going to become a concept in the mind, and that concept in the mind will become something that we then desire, right? So, you know, your highest concept of the broadest possible context, I like to call it, can be God. The broadest possible context you can have in mind can be the whole of nature. The broadest possible context you have in mind can be the universe. It can be the Atman in Vedanta, right? Atman and Brahma being one. Which those are very broad contexts, and you can become almost like 99.9% liberated if you give everything to God, or if you realize the union of Atman and Brahma, if you give everything back to nature. But as long as there is a concept, there is a boundary, right? It's sort of like I told Ivan once, like, people get under your skin because your skin is somewhere, right? Like, where is the boundary of yourself? That's where your skin is. I like to, like, use the example of angry neighbors in the US who don't like people parking in front of their houses, you know, because their sense of self goes all the way down to the street. And you park in front of their house, right? Why are you parking in front of my house? Like, that's, that's where your boundary of self is, or your views. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Really quick, I just wanted to say, I think we're not— yeah, no, I was just going to say, with the emotions, it's not void of emotions. It's not void of thoughts, feelings, or emotions, or else you'd just be a dead rock. It's void of the attachments that cause Dukkha to these thoughts, feelings, and emotions.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Yeah, the assumption of them, right, that taking them up as me and mine, the attachment, the clinging. Yeah, because the thoughts, the feelings, the emotions, these belong to the aggregates, right? So they belong to nature. And then not taking them personally prevents the suffering from arising.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** Essentially, the point that I was getting to about desirelessness is that we're deluded by desire. Desire is actually a negative thing, right? It's painful. Desire is painful. We don't see that desire is painful. That's part of our delusion. It's precisely because desire is painful that it drives our entire life, right? Hunger is a painful feeling that drives us to eat. You know, loneliness is a painful feeling that drives us to seek the company of others. Fear is a painful feeling that drives us to, you know, do a whole lot of things. Belief systems, you know, hatred of people with different beliefs, whatever. There's, you know, these are all like, you know, what is it called, the reproductive instinct, I like to say, you know, being horny. That is a painful feeling that drives us to seek, you know, sexual gratification or whatever. You know, every form of desire in every form is painful. It's deeply painful. And everything we do is to relieve that pain. And the pleasure that we get from fulfilling our desires is not coming from getting the object. It's from that very, very small moment of relief from the desire itself that we take to be satisfying. And that tiny little moment of desirelessness, we spend our whole lives chasing after it, right? But then we get like an emotional hangover, especially for the big desires, like Olympic athletes when they win gold, they go into a depression almost right afterwards because they've spent their whole life thinking, this is what I want, this is who I am, and then they win the gold and yeah, you know, and then in the next moment it's like, what the fuck, you know, what do I do next, kind of, who am I now, because they built their entire sense of self on that pursuit. We do it in small ways, but this is just a big example, you know, you might have spent your whole life thinking if you become a pilot, you know, and then you become a pilot and, you know, all of a sudden, like, the satisfaction you thought you were going to get wasn't there. But so just to keep it brief, it's desirelessness that we actually enjoy. And the training in the Dharma is about recognizing desirelessness when it's there. That's that third noble truth, the cessation of desire, the cessation of suffering that depends on desire. It's recognizing desirelessness and training the mind to take refuge there. That's the only safe refuge because it's the only place where the mind can become imperturbable. Like Dhammarato says, and Dhamma Das spends like 99% of the time he does his calls focusing on just this one point, you know. You know, when you're completely satisfied, basically free of desire, then like questions don't matter, attainments don't matter, labels don't matter, what's next doesn't matter, what came before doesn't matter, who am I, it doesn't matter. You know, just anything that you can pick up and say, oh, this is important, I want to know about this, it just ceases to have any meaning, right? It becomes signless. When desire is absent. And that is what the Buddha called the highest happiness, essentially, that state of complete satisfaction of being completely free of desire. So like Dhamma Das was also pointing out, I wouldn't say it's empty of emotion. It's just that whatever emotion is there is a wholesome emotion. And a wholesome emotion is one that doesn't create dissatisfaction. You can say. A wholesome thought is a thought that doesn't create dissatisfaction. But it's not like the thoughts and the feelings are so different. It's that the you who reacted to things as good or bad is sort of not there to make a big deal out of, to make things good or bad, to experience things as suffering or as happiness or sorrow or happiness. Things are just what they are, and when things are just allowed to be what they are, there's just this very peaceful coolness in the heart and the mind, which is that state of stopping and allowing the mind to heal, as I mentioned before. So I said the Dharma really is about healing. It's about just putting everything down, being satisfied without, and allowing the mind to heal. And then remembering to just keep putting it down, keep letting the mind heal. And everything else is built to that end. The perception of Anicca is just to convince the mind to put everything down so that the mind, the heart can heal, essentially. Perception of Dukkha, perception of Anatta, that's just there to convince the mind to stop grasping and clinging so that it can set itself down and allow itself time to heal.

**Speaker C:** Could I give my explanation just before we move on to the next topic? I agree with what Dhamma Dasadu and what you said, Michael, but the way I like to explain it, through meditation I've had states where I'm not moved by happiness or sadness, and it's sort of like is you don't see it as you who's sad. It's sort of like you're just seeing the sadness, and it's more like a beautiful work of art. Like, it's not like you're not feeling the emotion, you're completely feeling it, and it's like a completely different experience because it's like much more clear. And it's like looking at a masterpiece painting, it's just like you see it for what it is, as being like absolute perfection. So it's, uh, that's sort of how I put it into words.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you very much for answering my question.

**Speaker F:** I have a quick question on this topic before we move on, if it's okay. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Hello? Yes.

**Speaker F:** Okay, yes. So this desirelessness It's so amazing. But to me, it seems like this desirelessness can only happen in the now. You're having— Is it without doubt? Because a lot of times you have doubt about the future, and that can consume you. But it's not— I mean, it's part of the desires, I guess. But to me, it's like, is this something different to have doubts about this whole thing that would prevent you? Or maybe not even what Buddha says, just, you know, you have doubts about something happening in the future. Of course, you start thinking about the future. That's already— you're kind of getting lost there already. But does the Buddha talk about doubt at all in connection to this desirelessness?

**Speaker A:** Yes, definitely.

**Speaker F:** Okay, I didn't know. I didn't look very much, but I never heard anybody say, so I was wondering.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, of course I have things to say about that, but I wouldn't— I want to allow anybody else who wants to respond some time as well. At first I was looking at Mikey just because anytime a question about time or the future or the present moment comes up, he's always got the right thing to say. Okay, I feel like— but yeah, it's up to you, Mikey, if you want to respond to that at all. I put that in my notes.

**Speaker F:** Mikey the doubt.

**Speaker A:** He is the doubt now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, doubt. Doubt, there's different ways to reframe it, right?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So as Michael had just pointed out, yeah, you know, especially when we're talking about the future or the past, those things don't exist.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So any thoughts that we have of them are completely conceptual. And what does that mean? They're made up. We could even look at these conceptual thoughts and say, well, yeah, maybe there's some accuracy to them, right? You're able to guess who's going to win gold at the next Olympic event. So you think, oh, that conceptual thought that I have of the future was right. It was true. But it's worthwhile to recognize that you still made it up.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so in that moment that you made it up, there was no truth there. And the idea of getting away from doubt, throwing the doubt out, putting it far away from us. This is, yeah, about getting back into the present moment, into the here and now. Because even the here and now is conceptual. What you're experiencing with the senses is, in a way, still perceptions of reality. This is hot, this is cold, This smells good. This is stinky, right? These are still conceptual in their own way. And the question is, are you getting into it? Are you trying to put you inside of it? So like, you know, when you feel pain or a painful thought, or you have something stabbing you in some sort of way, if the thought arises, this is me, this is mine, this is my experience, then that's when the actual suffering occurs. Yeah, but if we don't, you know, I mean, the same thing is true even with happy thoughts, with happy feelings. When we fall into it and we have the thought of, oh, I am happy, I am experiencing pleasantness, you know, then there's an attachment there. And so once that happiness goes away, we see it as, oh, we lost a part of ourselves, and then there's grief. But we can just skip that entirely. So whenever something happy arises, such as like a happy thought or a happy feeling, We don't have to get into it. We don't have to fall into it like a trap. We can just see that it arises and go, oh, that's a happy thought. That's a happy feeling. Nice to see you. Same thing with the pain as well. It's a painful thought. It's a painful feeling. Don't need to attach to it. Don't need to attach it to me. And so doubt basically is just another form of attachment.

**Speaker F:** That's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's attaching to the future, or it's attaching to the past. Oh, I'm not sure I did the right thing in the past. You know, with the future, it's thinking, oh, I'm worried I might make the wrong decision in the future. Yeah, you see, do you see how we're falling into this concept? Because even, even again, the feelings and the thoughts that we're having right now, are still in their own way made up concepts because we can't hold on to them. We can't keep them. They're not ours. They're passing away. They're effervescent. So yeah, don't Don't try to grab on a hold to them. I love that analogy Michael made earlier of the hands grabbing onto the rope.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Mikey. I'm glad I punted that to you because that was just the perfect answer. And, you know, conventionally what Mikey's talking about is what emptiness is in early Buddhism, you know. The absence of what's not there, what's not here, the past, future, the conceptualizations of the present. But the reason that they're not here is exactly what Mikey is saying, is the absence of Upadana, putting ourselves into these arisings, these Sankharas, these concepts. And when the mind broadens to the point of where I really feel you're coming from, Mikey. Honestly, that's a very broad mind you're speaking from. And Ajahn Chah has a simile. He says, if you pour a spoonful of salt in a cup of water, the water will become salty. But if you pour a spoonful of salt into a big fresh lake, the lake's not going to become salty. So if the mind is identified with thoughts, feelings, emotions, it's like that cup of water. When dukkha arises, the mind becomes dukkha. It becomes salty in both senses of the word. But when the mind is broad and big, then you see it the way Mikey's describing. It's just, oh, there's a thought. That thought might have been your entire universe in the past. It might have been the entire universe in the past. An emotion may arise that used to be the entire world right, a memory, a thought of the future, whatever it may be. But when the mind broadens in the way that Maggie is describing, and these are— there's different ways the mind broadens in the suttas, through this entry into emptiness, but through the Brahma Viharas as well, right? It's considering developing a broad mind. Non-ill will is the path of the Brahma Viharas. So Metta is Universal non-ill will. Karuna is non-ill will towards those who suffer. Normally when we see someone suffering, we feel scared, we feel pity, we feel disgust. But having non-ill will towards those who are suffering, the mind won't collapse into those emotions. Mudita is non-ill will towards those who are happy and successful. Normally when the mind is small, when someone is happy and successful, we feel jealous, we feel envious, we feel competitive, because the mind is collapsed becomes small. But the broad mind of Metta does not collapse and become small, right? It stays very broad. And then of course, the Upekkha is the mind that sees in the way that Mikey's describing, that these are all just appearances, an experience, and there they are, you know, there it is. It's sort of like instead of the mind being a cloud, the mind is the atmosphere itself, right? The cloud is a modulation, it's a modification of the entire atmosphere. And it's sort of like, you can imagine, if your mind is the atmosphere, that when you get lost in a thought, a feeling, or emotion, you become identified with it because of Upadana. You become the cloud, and then as the cloud changes and degrades, you change and degrade, and as the cloud evaporates, you evaporate. But if the mind is the atmosphere itself, then The appearance of a cloud is just the appearance of a cloud. The disappearance of a cloud is just the disappearance of the cloud. The atmosphere remains unbothered. Just to go back to what Santiago was talking about, that unbothered mind just sees the appearance and disappearance of clouds within itself. Rivers, oceans, rain, these are just, you know, particularizations of the broader context that we call the water cycle. Right. So these are just different analogies for how the mind can become broad, so broad that whatever appears and disappears within it is not taken personally. And instead, it's just, there it is, you know, there it goes. Not, oh, here, you know, it's the drama is gone, essentially. And that, that the mistake that's usually made when things like this are said is we conceptualize the broad mind. It's not a concept, it's not an object, it's not a thing, it's not someplace else, it's not something else, it's not someone else. It's not something apart from experience. It's the same experience, you know, non-objectified, you can say. That's essentially one way you can understand emptiness or Metta or Jhana, right? They're just different sort of avenues to This broadest possible context, I like to think of it as, but that can become a concept. Think of it as the atmosphere. I like that analogy. Make your mind like the atmosphere, not like the cloud.

**Speaker F:** Fantastic. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Seeing everything is made up, it's another— it's just another way to talk about non-delusion, you know. Thinking that it's not made up is delusion. Thinking that it's real is delusion. Thinking that it's permanent, thinking that it's satisfying, thinking that it's real, you know. So Mikey's talking about non-delusion when you see that the past is made up, the future is made up. Even if the shot in the dark lands on target every once in a while, that doesn't mean that the shot was real or whatever, or that the target was there. Yeah. Anyway.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. And that's a good analogy you had because at some point we have to pull the trigger and even in the Sangha with these classes, it's like if we want to become good marksmen with guns or arrows, these are the classes, the Sangha that supports and gets us motivated to go out there on the range. But don't mistake the talking about the practice, talking about the shooting for the practice itself. It's part of the practice, but the best practice is to get get your gun, get your arrow, and you have to put in a little bit of time and go on the range and shoot. And that's gladdening the mind here and now, when you're away from us, away from talking about shooting at the target, when you're out there on the range breathing in, relaxing, letting go. And then the fruits of that practice, of that finger is the peace that I like to say is our true nature. And that's the emphasis, is the practice.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah. It's when Dhamma Das is talking about gladdening the mind, right? The Buddha says the happy mind is easily Samadhi'd. The happy mind is easily gathered together, because the Buddha speaks of everything in terms of causal connections. So he'll say, the happy mind is easily concentrated, or happily, the happy mind is easily unified. Unified mind easily sees things as they really are, gains knowledge and vision of things as they are. When the mind sees things as they really are, it gains disenchantment, dispassion, When the mind develops dispassion, you know, the cessation of wanting, then it gains release or cessation, cessation of clinging, right? That's becoming the cloud instead of the atmosphere. And then it gains knowledge and vision of release. So that's— so the purpose of gladdening the mind is to see is to get to the mind, as Buddhadasa called it, the mind fit for work. It's not necessarily the end, right? Gladdening the mind is not necessarily the end. It's the training that makes the mind fit for work. And the work is to see things as they are, to see things. That's why, you know, when we just kind of talk about things are okay as they are, there's resistance because the mind in its normal state doesn't see that. And it's not necessarily true. It's true in the ultimate sense, but it's not true in the particular context of the mind as it may be in your situation. But when you gladden the mind, as Dhammarato pointed out, as the practice, when you continuously gladden the mind, it makes the mind capable of seeing things as they really are. So, you know, clearing up that delusion, releasing identification with the cloud, allowing the mind to be the atmosphere, fear. But that's a good reminder that Dhamma Das is pointing out, is focusing on the practice, on the training, and not getting too attached to the end, because then that can create confusion, that can create more dissatisfaction, that can make us want to skip the training. So gladdening the mind here and now, that was a good reminder.

**Speaker C:** And also, would you consider, like, the cloud is part of the atmosphere, but if something happens to the cloud, it doesn't harm the atmosphere?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes, I would agree.

**Speaker D:** I want to ask about Bhikkhu Bodhisattva on his book Happiness and Hunger. Really love that book. He mentioned something about the idea of best is always— I'm paraphrasing here— but dangerous because it invites the mind to seek. So if there's always something better. So your mind will just be the forerunner, chasing, and restlessness will arise if one is not mindful. I often think about, is it contradicting in a sense that in the practice in itself, for me, I think it is really skillful and wholesome that I ask myself, you know, how can I be— I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it's like more satisfied. I mean, in a sense that it's my mind conceptualizing something right now. It's my mind not really in the present right now. It's my breath not deep enough. Like, question like this really helps. So isn't that in itself, I try to seek the best, like.

**Speaker A:** Seek Anapanasati? Yeah, I mean, Ivan, I feel like you know the answers to these questions as you ask them, but the word seek, how can I be more happy, that's still trying to use dissatisfaction to become satisfied, right? Seeking means, you know, something's missing, nothing's missing, you know. You brought up the book Happiness and Hunger. I believe it's a transcription of one of my favorite talks from Ajahn Buddhadasa of the same title. But my favorite quote, and I always bring this up because the Buddha spoke about the Noble Dhamma, that's where Dhammarato learn the noble Dharma from Buddhadasa is one of his closest, you know, friends is Ajahn Po. And being in Swanmook with them is— this, this is, you know, maybe a conversation with myself because I'm always trying to— well, not really so much recently, but talking to people who are a little bit more like my past self, stuck in the suttas. Although the suttas are wonderful, they can be, they can be used in the wrong way. It's like, oh, but there's this practice and this gradual practice of awakening, which it is gradual, but Buddhadasa cuts right through all of that in the same way that Dhammarato talks about cutting through the Gordian knot, right? Everybody was trying to untie that knot, right? They couldn't figure out how to untie it. Then here comes Gordian. It's an old Greek myth, I think, or maybe a Roman myth, but he just cut right through with a sword. And that's what satisfaction is about. But what Buddhadasa said in that talk or in that book is, you know, when you hear about the good, you hunger for the good. When you hear about the better, you hunger for the better. When you hear about the best, you hunger for the best. And you can even hunger for the better than the best. But what the Buddha taught is no hunger.

**Speaker D:** I still— this is funny because I think I get you, but at the same time, it's like, I don't know, I think maybe this is something Well.

**Speaker A:** The way it works, Ivan, is you have— you're in a relationship with someone who is toxic and bad for you, and we're all here telling you that this person is bad for you, and you know it, but you haven't— but you're not convinced just yet. You know, you need to see something concrete. You need to see something. You need to see that this person is like cheating on you, possibly You need to see it for yourself. Maybe we've told you they're cheating on you. I'm just using you as an example here of the mind that hasn't yet given up its relationship to hunger, essentially. I've used the analogy before, maybe in a different context, but the depth of seeing that, that's called seeing the Four Noble Truths, the depths of that seeing because they seem so plain on the surface. But when the Four Noble Truths are really seen, it's as impactful emotionally as if you found out that your parents weren't really your parents. They had actually murdered your real parents and kidnapped you as a baby and raised you as their own. That's how impactful it is to see the Four Noble Truths. Because who are our parents? The Buddha said that they are ignorance and craving. Ignorance and craving are the ones who have raised us up, given us our entire sense of self, given us our entire sense of what the world is, what we should do, what we shouldn't do, what's good, what's bad, everything. We are swimming in it. Just like fish don't know water is wet and frogs do, you know, we don't know that we're swimming in ignorance and craving. Until we've stepped outside of it fully. You know, it's like, you know, maybe you've floated on the surface of the water, but you haven't really become dry yet. So you don't really know the nature of water until you've become fully dry. That's kind of what it's like. But going back to the relationship metaphor, you know, you're not going to give up your passion for that person fully because your passion is deluding you into thinking that they're trustworthy, that they're good for you, that they're beautiful, they're honest. No matter what anybody tells you. But if you truly see them as they are, you find out that they actually collect cats off the street and cut their heads off and make flutes out of their souls, like in Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore. You're like, oh my God. Or they're Jeffrey Dahmer. Let's say you were in love with Jeffrey Dahmer and he seemed like a really nice guy and you loved him and he looks really handsome and, you know, he's charming and, you know, he's good to you. He buys you gifts. And he treats you really well and he tells you nice things, and then you come home and you catch him mid-eating somebody's arm, you know. And then at that moment you experience dispassion because you've seen Jeffrey Dahmer as he really is.

**Speaker D:** That's getting really interesting. Can I pull one more metaphor? Can I pull one? Example, because so what if like in the context of like when it comes to practicing meditation, I'm aware that at certain place and certain time it will be more relatively quiet, therefore that is the best time ever practice, and it really helped me. But is that in itself feeding the part of me that I think that's basically what I'm trying to get into. Isn't the discerning part important?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so sorry about the million analogies here, but if you were a drug addict, then knowing that you need to go to rehab is a good thing to know, you know what I mean? Meditation can be thought as like a detox for the mind, you know, as the quiet secluded practice. You know, you need to go and detox and let the mind become sober in order to see things more clearly, in order to become dispassionate towards the drug of choice. So you knowing that, you know, you knowing that, you knew, you knowing that your mind is not in a wholesome condition that's not a bad thing to know. That's a wise thing to know. And knowing that you need to create secluded practices where you can allow the mind to detox and sober up, essentially. That's because it sounds like you're asking about meditation, like structured or formal sats, something like that. Is that what you're talking about?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yes, it's sometimes even is that all too formal? Say, let's say, just trying to be aware if the Bhikkhuni is clinging onto something. So sometimes I'm, okay, you know what, I think I just hit the blind spot. I'm not sure. I'm just going to speak this out loud. I think that me, thinking about, am I being neurotic about whether am I seeking for the best in itself, that actually that's the part that's unwholesome. Because if I'm— because I don't know if I'm lying to myself, if I'm paying attention, I don't think there's any unwholesomeness in it. I'm just trying to make sure that.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like analysis paralysis.

**Speaker D:** Even, yeah, even just making sure in itself, that's unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Because when you just distance, maybe try distancing, you know what I mean? Like, listen to the way Mikey talks about thoughts, feelings, emotions, past and future. You can just see how far they are from his experience. He sees them, they're way over there, you know, they're not, he's not them, you know, like all of this thinking about what is wholesome and unwholesome, and this neurosis that you're talking about, that you're too inside of everything, you guys. So try to see if you can create some distance between where your point of view is, where your sense of self is. It's another thing about that change of lineage that the Buddha teaches is the self becomes secondary to experience, not primary. You know, we are— our way of experiencing the world is like, as you know, as like an 'I'm experiencing the.

**Speaker F:** World,'.

**Speaker A:** And that's sort of like dislocated in a way where I, me, mine are also thoughts, feelings, and images arising in experience rather than like receivers of experience. Anyway, so that's sort of what that analogy of the atmosphere and the cloud is about, you know, broadening the mind to the point where these thoughts you're talking about are just clouds in the atmosphere rather than like you're inside of them. But the means to doing that is non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion, because it's greed, hatred, and delusion that shrinks the mind into these phenomena. So non-greed is letting go of wanting things that you don't have, right? That dissatisfaction. Non-hatred is, and I've heard you talk about this too, is letting go of irritation, judgment, disliking of whatever it may be. So I've heard you talk about being irritated with other people's approach to the practice, or not doing it right, or having trouble, just whatever it may be, right? Any kind of irritation or ill will, you know, instead, you know, starting with that universal non-ill will just being, you know, just understanding that everything arises within a context of conditions. These aren't people doing things. These aren't people doing things to people or things happening to me. These are, you know, conditions arising within specific contexts. When the conditions are right for something to arise, it arises, right? So that's seeing things through you know, that noble right view, dependent origination, that helps you to achieve that non-ill will if you can see it that way, because it depersonalizes it, right? So take that personalization, that emotionalization out of that perception. Then the non-delusion is not seeing What is impermanent is permanent. A thought can feel permanent, a feeling can feel permanent, a perception can feel permanent, a judgment can feel permanent. You can look at your mom and think that she is this way. You have this fixed view of who she is, right? And maybe she's been that way your whole life, and maybe she'll be that way until she passes away, but that doesn't mean that it's permanent. So anyway, not seeing things that are impermanent as permanent, seeing things as impermanent, seeing things as unsatisfying, right? Because we're unconsciously deluded in this way, right? You may have the idea of the perfect situation for your practice, right? That idea of that perfect circumstance for your practice is a permanent, satisfying, controllable image in your mind. And that whole image is delusion. There's no permanent, satisfying, controllable circumstance. Circumstances are conditions, and conditions are impermanent, unsatisfying, and empty of self. So that's putting things into the proper context when you see them that way. And, you know, it always comes down to Whatever doubt you have, whatever restlessness there is, whatever it is that you want or don't want, these are just different forms of craving, shape-shifting itself to keep the mind off balance, to keep the mind wanting something it doesn't have. You can see that for what it is. Let go of the not wanting, be satisfied with the way things are, and keep returning to being satisfied bringing the mind back to being settled within itself. The last couple things the Buddha said before he died, right, one of the things he said is, is for— I can't remember the exact quote, but he said, you know, be an island unto yourself. Monks, be an island unto yourself. Take yourself as refuge. He's using the word self there in a broader sense. Of the undivided mind, essentially, because the mind divides itself and particularizes itself, and these particularizations are what we see as not-self. But when the mind kind of comes and settles into its own self, its own being, then it's undivided. It's that satisfaction, right? The mind kind of settles into itself. I'm kind of being careful here because I feel like some of these words can be misunderstood, but, um, you know, it's, it's letting go of those doubts, letting go of those wanting what you don't have, letting go of the being irritated and allowing things to just kind of settle. And like I said, allowing yourself to, to heal, you know, allowing the mind, mind to heal instead of being stuck in this cycle of dissatisfaction. Does that answer your question?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it does.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have something to say about this. I've been thinking about this topic a lot, and it seems— and I've been practicing— and it seems like doubt can have a net positive on the removal of Dukkha. Like, for example, if you think to yourself, is it possible for me to completely love every aspect of reality? Then that sort of little bit of doubt when you're asking a question is getting you to get into the present moment and actually take a look. And then if you can answer yes, oh yeah, now that I've actually taken a look, yeah, I can actually love every aspect of reality. That sort of Seems like it might be like, it might not actually do this. Maybe it's a blind spot I have, but it seems like you've taken a step forward and you removed a lot of Dukkha because you've actually taken a look and seen, you used that to do it, but you've like taken a step back, added some Dukkha. But then once you've taken a look, you can see, oh wow, I didn't need to actually have all this Dukkha, I can see now that I can love everything as it is. So it is counterintuitive where we're like, oh no, we don't want any Dukkha, don't have any doubt, or like we don't need any doubt. But it seems like it can actually benefit you. And that's been my experience when I've been practicing, like going for walks and stuff. So it's kind of counterintuitive how things work. With, uh, in my experience.

**Speaker B:** So I'd like to point to something Alexander Hippel put in the chat, which is doubt can have the quality of wanting to know. And with what you're talking about, Jordan, that's very much related. So a good example would be the question that a lot of people tend to have, which is Am I worthy of love? Can I be loved? Is there someone out there for me? Right? And there's many people that will then follow that question and go on this journey to find out the answer. And, you know, so they'll go on dates or download some dating apps, maybe even get married to somebody. And, you know, they get all the way to the wedding and they've said their vows and they said I do. And they finally answered the question. They've realized, oh yes, I can be loved. There is someone out there for me. I am worthy. And again, as Michael was pointing to earlier in the call, there actually is relief from dissatisfaction right then and there. Right? But it's not because that they got married. It's not because they got what they want. It's because they were finally able, after all of that, to set the question down. And what the Buddha taught and what we're saying here is practice throwing the questions out right now. We can skip this journey, we can skip all of these different steps, because if we get into the habit of having to take a prior step to what the Buddha is teaching, what the Buddha is telling us, then we're just filling, filling our day and filling our life with all of these unnecessary steps when we can just be satisfied right now, right here. And just enjoy life. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. So yeah, that could be a danger if you hold the doubt for like multiple days.

**Speaker B:** The thing is, the thing is, is you don't have to hold the doubt at all, is that you can, you can, you know, you can see when you've grabbed the doubt and throw it out. You can let go of it. There, there doesn't need to be this, okay, well, let me pick it up first. Dhammarato uses the analogy of like, do you need to pick up the shit to know that it's shit? Or can you see it from a distance? Can you just smell it, get a whiff of it and know, oh, I don't need that. That's unnecessary. Because what you're talking about is actually the way that people are always living their lives, is they are always having this practice of let me give in to the doubt just a little bit. All I need to know that somebody will love me is if I just get one match on Tinder, and then I'll know that I'm good enough. And then they've gotten the one match and they still don't feel good enough. So they say, well, all I need to know that someone can love me is if I go on a date and the girl smiles, or the boy smiles. And then they do that, and that still isn't good enough. So throw your questions out. Because the questions of, is this good enough? That is what is keeping you from seeing, that is what is keeping you from knowing this sort of, quote unquote, deeper knowledge that things are okay right now. Because if you don't have to question it, if you don't have to doubt it, then there's the knowing right there. Is that, oh yes, things are okay right now. When you don't have any questions about it, when you don't have any doubts about it. But playing this game of let me feed the doubt just a little bit. It's a dangerous game. Because again, like I said, it's a game we're already playing. And there's really no need for it at all, when instead we can practice the game of starving off the doubts and realizing that when the doubts die, I don't die. There is no me in the doubt to begin with. And in a way, this is what it means to go into the realm of the deathless. Is to see that when our thoughts, our feelings, our desires, when they pass away, everything's still okay, everything's still all right.

**Speaker D:** I have a quick question. Is it possible there can be skillful doubts, right? Borrowing back what Michael said about toxic relationship, I really love this. So what if it's a skillful dog saying, is my partner actually abusive? Isn't that actually a good way of first step into the stream? I don't know.

**Speaker E:** Just breathe and relax. Here and now. Just breathe and relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker E:** It's okay if you don't know. It's okay if you don't know the answers to your questions. There's nothing to figure out. It's not a puzzle. It's breathing, the practice of breathing and relaxing. Doesn't that feel good? And congratulate yourself. That's all it is. That's all it ever will be. That's all the Buddha did. I'm sure Mikey at his wat with Dhammarato, he breathes, he relaxes, he takes care of his responsibilities. And for the other Mike, it's the same thing. I'm sure he breathes and relaxes and takes care of his responsibilities. And for the Buddha, it was the same. He breathed, he relaxed, he chilled out, took care of some responsibilities. That's all it is. That's all it ever will be. Making it more mystical, like Mikey was saying, deeper, finding deeper meaning. It's just relaxing and breathing. Everything else is a hindrance. Everything else is an illusion, like Mikey was saying earlier. Just breathing and relax. That's the practice. And the fruits of that practice are just peace, emptiness. A whole bunch of words couldn't describe.

**Speaker A:** It, but it's just— I was just thinking about your— Dhamma is called the deathless, it's called the timeless. And the profound, the very profound thing that Mikey said, you know, is when he said, you know, and, and that's where the deathless is found, because when the doubt dies, you know, the knowing is still there. You know, you don't die with it. You know, I mean, I can't really say it better than you said it, Mikey, to be honest. I thought it was really well articulated. But it's just like when you're, you know, those optical illusions and then you can't see them, and then when you can see them, you can see them. Like the Dalmatian with all the— that there's like an illusion with a bunch of blotches of black, and it just looks like a bunch of blotches of black, and then all of a sudden you see, you adjust your vision a little bit, you can see there's a Dalmatian drinking from a puddle of water. You know what I'm talking about? I can't remember what those are called. That's how simple and profound the shift in perspective is, you know. When suddenly the mind isn't dragged into all of these questions and all these different forms of dissatisfaction. The— what was coming to mind while Mikey was talking is like, you have to have that absolute conviction, that devotion to reality, to being okay with things as they are, that he's demonstrating. Because one tiny little sip One tiny little sip of craving, it just snowballs. And it could snowball for minutes, hours, months, years, into your entire life, endless eons, endless expansions and contractions of the universe, right? Tiny little sip. I have this writer who I've always loved. His name is Jim Harrison. And he was like, they call him American Zen, but he was a heavy drinker. And he wrote this piece of nonfiction once about how to drink, which by the way, disclaimer, don't drink at all. But he was talking about how drinking begets drinking. If you're an alcoholic, one sip of alcohol or even a smell of it, and then the next day you wake up naked, face down in the gutter or whatever. That's the same thing with craving. It's exactly like that. You give into one tiny little doubt, one tiny little drop of dissatisfaction, and the mind dives into this state of intoxication again. It could become completely confused and blacked out. And, you know, what we're trying to do here is just like step directly into reality over and over and over and over again until it really becomes clear that that's all you need to do, that you just need to.

**Speaker F:** Be.

**Speaker A:** Happily present with reality as it is without needing to add anything to it, alter it in any way. What's left is just the fullness of experience. Nothing is missing. From this experience, right? It's full and complete exactly as it is. Nothing needs to be added to it. Anything you add to it just dilutes it. And you just stay with it. Don't give in to any version of dissatisfaction that the mind creates. Like Mikey said, that's what we've been doing our whole lives. This is a major change. To the way that everybody lives their life.

**Speaker C:** Okay, yeah, thanks. I appreciate your comments. I understand it, I think, a lot better. Like, uh, and yeah, I appreciate what you guys said.

**Speaker A:** I just noticed Dhamma Das is right, I'm breathing. And relaxing. Stop.

**Speaker E:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the truth is I'm not breathing. It's just, it's just the breath is happening all on its own.

**Speaker B:** Anyway, I do want to, uh, point out one thing, and that is Ivan had brought up the point of, you know, If you're in a toxic relationship, is it okay to ask, am I in a toxic relationship? And the thing there with this sort of thing is, look at what's going on, and you'll know whether or not you're in a toxic relationship. You know, like, if you're experiencing reality, if you're in reality, and you know what's happening, you don't have to ask this question of like, wait, is this real? It's just get into the practice of being in reality, and then you'll just know. And then not only will you know, it'll be a lot easier to know what the wise thing is to do in that situation, whether it's a toxic relationship or not.

**Speaker G:** The thing I've noticed with a lot.

**Speaker A:** Of toxic relationships, You just reminded me of one of my favorite one-liners in the suttas. It's in the Unbinding Sutta. It's an exclamation the Buddha made within those days of bliss post-awakening. They said, like, you know, he spent like, what, 7 weeks, like, enjoying the bliss of freedom before he did anything at all. And one of the things he uttered aloud was, um, all doubts vanish when he discerns a phenomena with its cause. Which sounds cryptic, but that's exactly what Mikey's talking about. You know, you don't have to question reality, you just have to like look at it. You know, you just gotta look at it, what's going on right in front of you, um, and then you won't doubt it. You know, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna ask, you know, is there a glass of water in my hand? You know, I can tell. Anyway, that's— but yeah, that's— Andrew, you.

**Speaker B:** Had something— you had something to say, Andrew?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm not sure if Michael could hear you because I heard you speaking earlier, but, uh, go ahead.

**Speaker G:** Uh, yeah, no, I just wanted to say on the, um, on the subject of the toxic relationships, what I've noticed with a lot of toxic relationships is the thing that sort of prevents the people from making the leap to, you know, leave the toxic relationship is that it's like a security issue.

**Speaker A:** A lot of the time— I don't hear anything.

**Speaker G:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's just something on your end. Something on your end, mate.

**Speaker G:** I'm just talking into my— You guys can hear him? I'm just talking to the mic on my phone.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, we can hear you, Andrew. For some reason, Michael can't.

**Speaker A:** I think what it might be is that I think one side of my speaker on the bottom of my iPhone has two sets of speakers. Only one of them works. So maybe his voice is coming through the one that doesn't work. Nirodha.

**Speaker G:** Okay. No, I was just going to say.

**Speaker A:** That maybe somebody can repeat it and see what we do with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll let you know when he's finished. Go ahead, Andrew.

**Speaker A:** Oh, sorry.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I was just thinking that one of the big factors for people being able to leave the toxic relationship is a matter of security for them. I'm sort of thinking in terms of domestic violence and stuff, like when there's a woman who's involved with a man, and she might be able to see all the bad things that he's doing, and she might realize it's a toxic relationship but may not be able to leave it due to her just not being confident that she'll be able to support herself, or they might have kids or whatever. So I was just, you know, yeah, wanted to state that, how important it is to be able to have some sort of refuge within yourself, or like some confidence, I guess, yeah, to be able to develop that confidence. Within yourself before you can actually, um, you know, make that leap. Because it can be quite scary to, you know, to make, make a big leap, which is to say, all right, I'm happy with everything right now. Um, you need to actually feel like that you're happy right now, you know. That's, that's, that's part of the.

**Speaker C:** Um.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, part, part of it is, is being able to develop that gladdening of the mind and, um, Yeah, so that you have the confidence. Yeah, that's basically it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very well put, Andrew. Michael, he was basically talking about coming back to the refuge within. And yeah, I'm so happy that you put that there and reframed it into the idea of a toxic relationship. Because, I mean, again, we're just pointing at the same thing, the same practice over and over again. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. How do you get out of the dukkha? By going within. Buddha Dasa would repeat all the time, inside, inside. Even you can even hear him say it in English sometimes. You know, he didn't speak much English, but he would say the word inside.

**Speaker E:** We have a toxic— a lot of people have a toxic relationship with their mind, with Mara. So the same rules apply whether it's a physical person or your own mind. You don't want to get caught up in the weeds, you know, causes nothing but dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Well said, Dhamma Dasa. I'm going to go ahead and end the recording here now. Feel free to continue hanging out, folks. This has been a really pleasant talk. Thank you, Michael, for hosting.

**Speaker A:** Thank you very much.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by Michael (Speaker A) with a group of Sangha friends, revolves around two main questions and explores the core Buddhist theme of overcoming desire and dissatisfaction to find true peace. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The End of Suffering Through Desirelessness**
The central teaching is that suffering (*dukkha*) arises from craving (*tanha*) and the mental divisions created by desire. True peace—Nibbana—is found in a state of desirelessness, where the mind is "unmoved" by worldly conditions and fully present.

---

### **1. Addressing Edward's Question: "Is a strong desire to be present helpful?"**
*   **Initial Contradiction:** A strong desire to be present seems contradictory because desire itself divides the mind and pulls it away from the present.
*   **The Mechanism of Division:** The mind is constantly fragmented by the conflict between **what we want**, **how we think things should be**, and **how things actually are**. This conflict is driven by desire (greed, hatred, delusion).
*   **A "Skillful Hack":** Since we are habituated to desire, we can use it skillfully by **desiring what is freely available right now** (e.g., "I want this breath"). When the desire and its object are simultaneous, they extinguish each other like two fires meeting, leading to a moment of satisfaction and presence.
*   **The Ultimate Goal:** True presence is a **desireless, unified mind** that is satisfied with things as they are, not chasing or rejecting experiences.

---

### **2. Addressing Santiago's Question: "What is a mind unmoved by happiness and sorrow like?"**
*   **Not Emotionless:** This state (akin to the equanimity of *upekkha*) is **not void of feeling**. Emotions and thoughts still arise, but they are not "taken personally." There is no attachment, identification, or clinging to them as "me" or "mine."
*   **Like the Atmosphere and Clouds:** A helpful analogy: An ordinary mind is like a cloud, identified with every passing thought/emotion. A liberated mind is like the **vast atmosphere**, in which clouds (thoughts, feelings) appear and disappear without disturbing its essential nature. One experiences emotions with clarity, like observing "a beautiful work of art."
*   **The Bliss of Desirelessness:** What we typically call "happiness" is actually a brief relief from the pain of desire. The state of being unmoved is a deeper, stable **bliss of desirelessness** (*nirodha*), where the mind is healed, peaceful, and imperturbable by the "eight worldly winds" (gain/loss, fame/disrepute, praise/blame, pleasure/pain).

---

### **Key Practice Insights Discussed:**
*   **Healing the Mind:** The Dhamma practice is framed as **healing**. We have been "stabbing" or "scratching" our minds with dissatisfaction for lifetimes. Practice is about stopping this—putting the mind down, letting it rest, and allowing it to heal.
*   **"Everything is okay exactly as it is":** This is not a naive affirmation but a radical **antidote to the narratives of dissatisfaction**. It's a tool to undermine craving and invite the mind to rest within itself.
*   **The Role of Doubt:** Doubt is a form of craving for certainty, often about the future or past. It can be a hindrance. The solution is to **"throw the doubt out"**—recognize it as a conceptual fabrication and return to the present reality. True knowing arises when questioning ceases.
*   **Broadening the Mind:** Through practices like the *brahmaviharas* (loving-kindness, compassion, etc.) and insight into impermanence (*anicca*), the mind learns to **not collapse into phenomena**. It becomes broad and stable, like the atmosphere, rather than being tossed about like a cloud.
*   **Simplicity of Practice:** Ultimately, the practice is simple: **breathe, relax, gladden the mind here and now**. This creates a "mind fit for work" that can then see things as they are (impermanent, unsatisfying, not-self), leading to dispassion and release.

### **Conclusion**
The talk emphasizes that the path to freedom is not about acquiring special states, but about **letting go of the habitual craving and dissatisfaction that fabricates our suffering**. By learning to be satisfied without desire, the mind settles into its natural state of peace, becoming "unmoved" yet fully alive to the present moment. The practice is a continuous return to this refuge within.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts (Dhamma). Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

**1. The Divided Mind & Conflicting Desires**
*   **Wild Animals:** Referencing the Buddha, the mind is like an animal being pulled in different directions by desires.
*   **Toxic, High-Conflict Relationship:** The mind is divided by the conflict between **what we want**, **what we think should be**, and **the way things actually are**. Alignment brings bliss; misalignment causes suffering.
*   **The Pasta Example:** A simple story of internal conflict between the desire to be fit and the desire to eat pasta at night, illustrating how desires pull us apart.

**2. Desire as Fire & Extinguishing It**
*   **Desire is a Fire:** Craving is depicted as a burning, painful force.
*   **The Backburner:** A technique for using desire against itself. Wanting something freely available in the present (like the next breath) is like lighting a "backburner" fire. When this desire meets the object (reality), both desires extinguish each other, leading to satisfaction.

**3. The Mind's Narratives and Healing**
*   **Rumpelstiltskins Spinning Yarns:** Greed, hatred, and delusion (lobha, dosa, moha) are like little storytellers constantly spinning narratives in the mind, creating different "selves" or characters.
*   **Sewer & Hamburgers:** Cultivating wholesome thoughts is like piling hamburgers on top of a sewer. Eventually, you have enough good "layers" (wholesome thoughts) that you can live off the top, even if the base (old habits) is still unclean. An alternative is to clean out the sewer (abandon unwholesome thoughts).
*   **An Open Wound / Scratching an Itch:** The mind, hurt by greed, hatred, and delusion, is like an itchy wound. Our habitual reactions (chasing desires, getting irritated) are like scratching it, which provides momentary relief but prevents healing. The practice is to **stop scratching** and let the mind heal.
*   **Stabbing the Mind:** Building on the wound metaphor, Buddha Dasa described the *kilesas* (defilements) as needles stabbing the mind. The practice is to stop the self-inflicted injury.

**4. Broad Mind vs. Narrow Mind (Non-Attachment)**
*   **The Cloud and the Atmosphere:** This is a central metaphor.
    *   **The Cloud:** A thought, feeling, or emotion we identify with. When we attach to it ("this is me, this is mine"), we *become* the cloud. We suffer as it changes and evaporates.
    *   **The Atmosphere:** The broad, aware, undivided mind itself. When we don't attach, we are like the atmosphere in which clouds (experiences) appear and disappear without affecting the vast sky. The atmosphere remains "unbothered."
*   **Cup of Water vs. Lake (Ajahn Chah):** Pour salt (suffering) into a cup (a small, attached mind), and it becomes bitter. Pour the same salt into a lake (a broad, spacious mind), and it has no effect.
*   **The Rope Burn:** Reality is like a rope being pulled fast by a boat. Grasping onto it (clinging) gives us a painful rope burn. Seeing the rope's speed (the **perception of impermanence - *anicca***) convinces us not to grab it, thus avoiding suffering.

**5. The Nature of Liberation (Nibbana)**
*   **Signlessness:** Nibbana is "signless." A stop sign *signifies* "stop." Nibbana has no such reference point in our ordinary experience; it cannot be conceptualized or made into an image.
*   **Dying Before You Die:** The structure of self is fabricated by desire. Liberation involves the cessation of that fabrication, which feels like a death of the old identity.
*   **Becoming Dry to Know Water:** We are like fish who don't know water is wet. Only by stepping out of water (craving and ignorance) and becoming "dry" can we truly understand its nature. Floating on the surface isn't enough.

**6. Doubt and Conceptual Thinking**
*   **The Dalmatian Optical Illusion:** Gaining liberating insight is like suddenly seeing the hidden Dalmatian in a pattern of black blotches. It's a simple but profound shift in perspective that was always available.
*   **The Alcoholic's Sip (Jim Harrison):** Giving in to even a tiny doubt or craving is like an alcoholic taking one sip. It can trigger a cascade leading to a full "intoxication" of the mind (confusion, suffering). The practice is to avoid that first sip.
*   **The Target Practice:** Talking about Dhamma is like taking a class on marksmanship. It's necessary, but don't confuse it with the actual practice, which is going to the range and shooting (gladdening the mind here and now through breathing and relaxing).

**7. The "Victim" vs. the "Winner"**
*   **The Victim's Attitude:** The ordinary person (*puthujjana*, translated as "thickster") is like a victim, blaming external conditions (upbringing, ADHD, the world) for their dissatisfaction. They are "swollen with stupidity" and can't see the truth right in front of them.
*   **The Winner's Attitude:** The person on the path takes responsibility, realizing "I'm doing this to myself," and moves from blame to agency.

**8. Toxic Relationship with Craving**
*   **The Jeffrey Dahmer Partner:** Our relationship with craving/desire is like being in love with a charming partner who is secretly a monster. We are deluded by desire's allure until we truly "see" its harmful nature (like catching them in a horrific act), which leads to **dispassion**.
*   **Drug Addiction & Rehab:** Knowing you need a quiet place to meditate is like a drug addict knowing they need rehab. It's a wise discernment, not a craving, because it's part of the "detox" needed to see clearly and become "sober."

### **Summary of Key Stories & Frameworks**
*   **Dhammarato's Framework:** The conflict between Want, Should, and Reality.
*   **The Gordian Knot:** The Buddha's teaching (especially the "everything is okay" approach) cuts through the tangled problem of suffering like Alexander cutting the Gordian Knot, instead of trying to untie it.
*   **Olympic Athlete's Depression:** After achieving a lifelong goal (winning gold), athletes often feel depressed because they built their identity on the pursuit. The brief satisfaction came from the **cessation of desire**, not the object itself, revealing the hollow nature of the chase.
*   **Angry Neighbors & Boundaries:** Our sense of self expands to our perceived boundaries (e.g., getting angry if someone parks in front of "our" house). This illustrates how we create and defend a self through identification and possession.

These metaphors collectively paint a picture of the mind as a conditioned, story-generating entity that suffers through attachment and division. The path is one of stopping harmful habits, broadening perspective, disentangling from narratives, and allowing the mind to rest in its natural, healed, and "unbothered" state.
