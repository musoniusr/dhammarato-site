### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so today, or actually this is Friday evening call, we have a question about right livelihood. I would say that we could— first thing to say is that we could even change the language that we're using there. From Right Livelihood into Right Lifestyle. And that the first thing is that there are two ways to look at it. One is the ordinary way of rules and precepts, and then the other way of looking at it is from the lens of the noble mind. Now, what we mean by that is that ordinary people, the vast majority of people who are either in a religion or in Buddhism or whatever, the ordinary people have it from the perspective of it's a rule to follow, it's something that you should do. And so, Right Livelihood has also the quality of being dependent upon Right Speech and Right Action. You could then say that Right Speech and Right Action, over time, would be the lifestyle or the the right livelihood. And so the right action is right now, and right speech is right now, but right livelihood would be over time. So let's look at it not from a rule position but from the noble position. And in the noble way of looking at it, it's the very last item on the list. And it goes from the top to the bottom. So let's go over actually the Eightfold Noble Path so that we can get the context of what right livelihood actually is. So the Buddha starts with the Eightfold Noble Path in the sense that we have to remember to take a look, to look at what's going on. And so in right livelihood, that looking at what's going on would be also over time, looking back and reflecting how things have been and how things are going. But as we look in the moment and see what's going on in the mind right now, that's going to affect the kind of Right Livelihood we have. For instance, if you are working in a particular place, and something comes up right here, right now, and we see that what's happening, we have a choice about it. And so on the issue of Right Livelihood, that means that it may take a choice also that's going to take some time to implement it. So if we make a choice and become a winner for the moment, practicing correctly, getting the mind into a noble state to where we don't want anything, then right action and speech become much easier because you don't want anything. It's unlikely you're going to kill somebody if you don't want anything. It's unlikely you're going to steal if you don't want anything. It's unlikely for you to lie if you don't want anything. So that's the very basics of it. And that also then applies to right livelihood, that in fact, if you don't really want anything, you don't need much of a livelihood. But there are certain items on the list of the right livelihood that we can endeavor, we can look at to see What's really going on there? Now, in the sutta that I'm referring to, which is Majjhima Nikaya number 117, that's the one that I use the most, which is the exposition on right livelihood. It's actually the translation is the Great Forty. That's the name of the sutta. So in right livelihood, the Buddha actually mentions things like buying and selling. Now what that meant, basically, that's all of business. A big business will buy raw materials, make something, and sell it. That a Fletcher will go gather up some feathers, some glue, a stone or two, and some sticks, and make arrows. And then he'll sell them. All right, so buying and selling is something that the Buddha recommends us not do because we generally will get into false speech. For instance, selling is basically getting someone else to do something they don't want to do. That if in fact the selling took no effort, in other words, it's just on display, except that Walmart does a lot of selling to get people in the store so that they can select on their own what to buy. So there's a lot of buying and selling going on, and we can look at, well, what kind of jobs would we have that we weren't buying and selling. Generally, we have time to sell. So, we have to look at it from the differences, is that there are some things that we call buying, and then there's things that we would call selling. For instance, you buy a car, you drive it around for a few years, getting some repairs or whatnot, and then there comes a time to sell it. That doesn't come into this situation. What the situation is, is it's like one word together that has the sound of buying and selling. So you intentionally buy this in order to sell it, not in order to use it and then later sell it. All right. So that's an important point about the buying and selling, is that it's a combination. That in fact, we would all not be able to live at all if there wasn't quite a lot of buying and then selling later. But the question was, what was the intention of buying it? Was the intention of buying it in order to sell it. And so if we are in that situation, and we're talking about— I mean, probably the best example of that is a used car salesman, that they buy used cars in order to clean them up, fix them up, and then sell them. And there's a lot of dishonesty in that business. There's a lot of dishonesty in actually the repair business of cars, and that then would be one kind of occupation to try to avoid. So, with that as a reference, we now can look at it in a way of What happens with people is that part of their job or part of their activity is something that they don't like doing, but they do it anyway. We have been doing that our whole lives, that a child will go to school when he doesn't want to, the child will do his homework when he doesn't want to. The child will clean up his room when he doesn't want to. The child will eat his peas and his broccoli and his carrots when he doesn't want to. And so we get in the habit of doing things that we don't want to do, and we do them anyway because of some rule that we picked up along the way. We're supposed to. And one of the things that you hear in the West is, "Oh, you're supposed to have a job." That people are not in fact looked up to because they have the freedom of no employment. That in fact, even the ultra-rich still stay employed. Maybe their employment is to be a celebrity, or maybe the employment is to get more money. And so we tend to think of it all as we're supposed to stay employed, we're supposed to do something. And the question is, are we going to do what we're going to do happily, or are we going to do it because we're supposed to do it, and do it without doing it happily. In fact, we do it unhappily. So, if that's the case, then it's hard for us to tell whether or not what we're doing is Right Livelihood or not, because we can't use the criteria of the selection of "I don't like it." And yet that's the way that we handle almost everything. Getting into the Buddhist teaching of Paticcasamuppada, that an event happens, coming in as sensory input, and then we mix it with the past in our perception of it, in order to understand the moment. Understanding means that what we're seeing, or happening right now, is being mixed in with the past. That if everything was brand new, if everything was brand new, we wouldn't understand anything. That in fact, the way that we understand things is by putting them in the context of what's in the past. Well, often what's in the past has emotional baggage to it. That in fact, if we learn to not do something, often that comes with the fact that because we did do it once, we had bad feelings. And so, the bad feelings of doing it now in the present moment are actually old, learned bad feelings that were associated with doing that. That's why we often at work, do the job itself, what's intended to do, but we don't like it. Why is that? Because we learned that habit of doing and not liking it in our childhood. So, if we do things and not like it— Hello, Tathagata! Good to see you. Hello everyone. It's funny that you came in on this because we're going to be getting into in this talk about what really right livelihood is. That in the first thing that we have to do is we have to figure out what is not right livelihood, and that's the part that we're talking about now. And that it's difficult to figure out what is and what is not, not good or not right livelihood because we mix our feelings into it, that we don't see things very clearly. And so, the first thing that we need to do from the noble perspective is to be able to see that, and to be able to manage it to the point that we have a noble attitude. But generally what happens is that a lot of the rules that we make, are made emotionally in childhood and in adulthood, and these are done ignorantly. And this is how it happens: if I like something, then I think that I'll like it a lot for a long time if I can keep it close to me. This is what we mean by ownership and control. If I can own that thing and control it, I— because I like it, it will be close to me and I can like it often. Okay, a clear example of that is downloading a movie. We like it when we're watching it, and so we download it. Whether the movie is an action movie or porn or whatever it is, we'll download it so that we can own it and control it But that's all that we do with it. After that, we don't watch it. Let us say The Good, Bad and the Ugly, one of those old movies, very famous. And yet the people who like it and watch it don't like it and watch it and like it and watch it and keep, you know, day after day watching the movie 10 or 15 times. That we put it down and it becomes a file on the computer. We own it, we control it. But we're not— we think about it then, or we see that file on the computer and it'll remind us of the movie and we'll get that hit of pleasure. But we don't watch the movie again. Not often. All right. So disliking and then wanting and then being able to get it and control it. That also has to do with the point that if I like it and I want it and I get it, then it must be good. And if I don't like it and don't want it, then it must be bad. Now this is an ignorant thing that we do, but we do that a lot. That in fact you could say that, "Oh, that girl is beautiful. Oh, I like what she looks like. Oh, I want her." Therefore, she would be good for me. And that's the ignorant point. You don't know whether she's going to be good for you at all. All you know is that you like it and you want it and you want to get it. You want to control it. And we also think it is going to be good. And that's part of the ignorance that we have that the Buddha talks about in the Second Noble Truth. And in fact, that's basically what we're talking about here. Is that we ignorantly want things, and because we like it, we think it's going to be good. So when we're out looking for new jobs, we're looking for things that we like, like a high salary, easy working conditions, and things like that. And if we want the job and we have the delusion that that job is going to be good for us, And then later, we begin to figure out, "Oh no, maybe it's not so good for us. I don't like it so much now, because now I'm doing it." And so, there's a whole lot of difference between that stage of liking and wanting, and then getting and having to put up with the fact that you've got it now. But we also make a lot of rules. In our minds about what is good and what is bad without using wisdom at all to figure that out, without a real investigation. We just assume because we like it, it must be good, and we don't like it, it must be bad. This is a common thing because then what happens is that we make rules about it. Oh, because I like it and it must be good, Therefore, I should behave this way about it. And if I don't like it and don't want it around, then it must be bad. And now I'll do things according to that new rule that this thing is bad, whatever it is. And so some people, because of the way that they feel, they see the same thing. Some of them will see it good, some of them see it bad, some of them say it's indifferent to it. And all of that, and all of it is based upon their feelings, without recognizing for sure what is good, what is bad, that in fact we need to have some sort of criteria for deciding whether something is good or bad, that is not emotionally charged, or liking and not liking. And our wanting and not wanting, then become the way that we see the world, rather than seeing it as actually it is. And so that seeing things as they actually are takes some investigation, it takes some wisdom, and it takes also a basis of foundation. And so we can go back to the Buddha to gain that, that if something causes Dukkha or it does not cause Dukkha, should be a better criteria for what is good and what is bad. So that if this thing harms me and harms other people, now that should become part of the basis of the rule of whether it's good or bad or not. But we don't. We often decide that things are good or bad based upon whether we like it or not. This is an ignorant thing, and almost always because we like something, we want it, and decide that it must be good, we are ignorantly, we are blindly not understanding that this thing may in fact be Dukkha. It may cause a lot of trouble. A clear example of that would be alcohol. A clear example of that would be rat poison, or maybe Raid. Get rid of those insects, get rid of those mice. Okay, so this is the kind of thing that we decide upon, and that if we recognize it through wisdom that this thing causes a lot of harm Now, that would be a much better criteria for how we choose what is right livelihood, rather than whether we like it or don't like it, because a lot of the jobs that we have, we don't like them. And so we think that the job is bad and it must be wrong livelihood because I don't like it. And that's not the right criteria. The right criteria is that if I do this job, Does it create harm, or does it fulfill a need? If we can see things from that position, now there's a whole lot of professions that we begin to investigate. But we can't investigate the job or the position if we're stuck in it and don't like it. Also, we think that we have to have the job, because, "Oh, poor me, what's to become of me?" when I get fired. That in fact, getting fired from a job is a trauma for most people. Even in adulthood, if you get fired from a job, it may take you years to get over it. I remember in 1973 or '74, I got fired from a job. It changed my life, and it actually changed my life for the better, But I still wince every time I think about getting that fired way back when, 50 years ago. All right, that's a big trauma that we don't want to lose a job because we identify with that job. We see ourselves as a coder rather than just that's the employment. We could lose a house, we could lose a wife, we could lose really, really big things, but the livelihood seems to be the biggest one of all. That's the real tragedy. The real tragedy is that I've lost my livelihood, I can't get a job. And in fact, everybody who gets fired thinks that they can't get a job again. But that was so devastating that they don't see things in the sense of, wow, I probably got fired because I wasn't liking the job in the first place. I wasn't doing a good job at it. I was ignoring that job. Everybody in the place knew that I wasn't doing a good job. And so I got fired from it. They did me a favor. And wow, that's hard for most people to see. So, if we can begin to see things clearly, and the way that we would do that is with the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path and being in the moment, so that we can see things from a noble position, we can see things through wisdom, then we can decide whether that job actually causes suffering in and of itself in the job, rather than it's causing me suffering because I don't like it, or it's causing me suffering because I got fired. We're looking at the job itself. Is this job wholesome in general? For everyone. And there's a huge number of jobs that we could save in, that are actually dangerous, not just for the individual, but in general. For instance, working on the Manhattan Project. The guys who were working on the Manhattan Project, some of them were really interested in getting it done. You know what I mean by the Manhattan Project? OK, everybody knows that, we had that in school. The Manhattan Project was the development and the implementation of the nuclear bomb. Why they called it Manhattan Project, I'm not sure, because it happened in a baseball field in Chicago, so I understand. The point is, is that the people who were working on that project did not understand the damage and the problems that they would cause. And now it's been 70 years since they did that, and people are still suffering under the damage that was done in that project. They couldn't see into the future to see what a terrible situation that it would be. That the whole world could be frightened by one guy, Kim Jong-un, in North Korea, because he's got these nuclear weapons that he would have never had if it hadn't have been for the few people who were working on the Manhattan Project. So that's an example of it. Another example would be having a job as a bartender. Or working in a bar, or owning a bar, that in fact this is one of them that's actually in the Suttas, is buying and selling alcohol. Why? Because buying and selling alcohol actually creates a tremendous amount of suffering. Fights at home, the guy comes home drunk, he gets violent, etc., like that. And if there were people, rather than having laws against alcohol, or having laws regulating alcohol, if every individual who was applying for the job of a bartender could see the damage that he would be involved with. Now, a lot of them will say, "Oh, well, I'm a good psychologist. I'm a bartender, and people come in and tell me all of their troubles." Well, if you're going to be a psychologist, go be a psychologist. You don't need to get the guy drunk. In order for him to open up. And so, if every one of the bartenders could see, "Oh, being a bartender is not a healthy job," then there would be no bartenders. And because of there being no bartenders, there would be no bars. And so, the alcohol industry would basically greatly diminish, there wouldn't be near as much alcohol, being drank, if there was not so much alcohol being sold. So, there's other occupations that are actually in the Suttas, and buying and selling alcohol is one of them. Another one would be poison, involved with manufacturing, buying, and selling poison. A good example of that is that the farming industry has been using poisons for a lot. They still haven't figured out about DDT, which they took off the market years ago in the West, but in Thailand, some people are still using DDT, and they're getting sick off of it. They don't recognize that that poison is poison everywhere. And so, dealing with poisons would be one of the items that you find in the Sutras. Another one would be buying and selling weapons. If nobody was selling any weapons, if there were no arms dealers, then there would be very few arms on the planet. And so clearly, buying and selling weapons is a very, very big problem. So these are the kind of professions that we can see are inherently dangerous just to be in that profession. So even if you're the secretary, or you're, let us say, the janitor, cleaning out and washing down the kegs of beer, that would be an unwholesome profession, because the whole point of it is to help buy and sell alcohol. So, even spring manufacturers who actually manufacture a particular spring that they know that it's going to be sold to the gun manufacturers, if they recognized at all, let's not make that spring, because that spring is needed to manufacture this gun. And so, if people were looking at it from that perspective, they would see that buying and selling weapons, even the manufacture or the helping of it. There are also a lot of professions that are intentionally harmful. An example of that would be police; that police are intentionally hired, and that the kind of people that they want to hire as police are maybe the high school bullies. The people who want to have force over other people, then in fact that's something that we all like to do, is to have power and force over other people. And so being associated with the police means that your profession is out there actually doing harm. And they say, well, what about the crooks? Well, the crooks are out there actually intentionally doing harm. Does one wrong and another wrong make a right? If the criminals are out there making wrongdoing and harming people, and now the cops are out here to do harm to the criminals, does two wrongs make a right? Just by the way, an old cowboy point, and that's the idea of getting revenge: "Oh, he hurt me, I'm going to go hurt him." "and then we're even." No, two wrongs don't make a right. And so, having a profession like police, that would be an unwholesome, that would be a not-right livelihood, that in fact, in many cases, is downright taking life away. Cops, in the United States especially, go around killing people, often innocent people, they're out there causing harm. And anyone— in fact, I've had 4 or 5 cases where people have come to me as a policeman, and I would recommend, after a while of talking about it, to get them to see that that kind of job is harmful to them, because they're actually actively out harming people. And they need to find a way to come at peace with themselves, and if they're at peace in their own mind, then they're not going to do that job that way anymore, and probably not do that job anymore, because the job itself is inherently, intentionally causing suffering. Another one would be a court judge. I couldn't be a judge. I thought about that from an early time. I could not be the one who intentionally harms this guy by sentencing him to 20 years, no matter whatever he's done. You see, within the context of the teaching of the Buddha, especially from the perspective of being a monk in the Sangha, is that wrongdoing is treated differently than the way that normal society does it. Normal society is in that revenge mode of two wrongs will make a right. But within the context of the teaching of the Buddha, we see, oh, we don't want to punish wrongdoing, we want to rehabilitate it. We want to teach the people to not do that kind of thing. And yet, you can see that the way that the prison systems are set up generally, I think that Germany is one exception to that, but most prisons are designed to punish people, and the punishment goes on and on and on, so that they form gangs, it's a very violent place, and often people when they're in prison will learn from their teachers how to be even better at their wrongdoing and their causing harm. The best place to train a criminal is in prison, because you're putting him around other criminals. What would be better, if you find a criminal, is to put him among nobles, to rehabilitate him, to see that what he is doing is not right livelihood, that he's out there harming people. And so this is the whole point about what is right livelihood and what's not right livelihood, is the point about Dukkha. If you're creating Dukkha with this job, then this is not right livelihood. Well, guess what? Most of the jobs that are done fall under that classification of not right livelihood. Buying and selling is the point. And so, what could we do with our time that would be useful? I would say some kinds of right livelihood would be, for instance, being a social worker, except that the social workers often harm people because of the restraints from the laws, that their legal system, the boundaries that are set by the job itself, wind up causing harm to people. Another one would be politicians. Politicians are very, very harmful kind of people. They're very greedy, all right? And often when people do get a lot of money, even if the money that they gained right livelihood. An example of that would be, oh, we want to do a whole lot of good for the world about let's have less global warming, let's have electric cars, let's start making electric cars. And now we have the issue of Tesla, and everything about the company is out there doing good, in the sense of old dojo and AI and robotics and taking cars off the road because they've got robo-taxis and things like this. But meanwhile, Elon Musk is going around himself causing enormous amounts of trouble and damage and problems. His whole escapade with Twitter is an example. Now we find out that he's actually stopped helping Ukraine with his satellite links, took the satellite Starlink away from them, and is doing other things to help Putin. And Putin's out there to cause harm. So Elon Musk is using a lot of the resources that he gained by doing good, by out there now doing harm. And so this is the way that we begin to look at what is right livelihood and what is wrong livelihood. And almost every possible livelihood that we could have winds up, because it's out in the ordinary society, at best a mix of right livelihood and wrong livelihood. But the vast majority of the jobs are part of wrong livelihood. An example of that is, oh, we need steel in order to have a car. Therefore, we need steel mills in order to have steel, which means we have to have a lot of coal. And so here we are, digging up iron ore and coal, harming the environment, putting great big pits, mines, open mines and all of that, that you could go so far even to say that humanity is a skin rash on the planet Earth. Humanity is going down, cutting down all the trees, and that we are actually harming ourselves through harming the planet, through our greed of wanting to buy and to sell. We want to dig that coal out of the ground— that's the buying of it— and then selling it. Michael, do you have— I'm seeing you, that you're almost dancing with excitement Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is awesome. I've really appreciated this talk so far. Thank you so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** I'm curious. Yeah, it's like, so I mean, it seems like you're saying that there aren't really any jobs that are like totally right livelihood these days, or am I missing the point here?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, let us say it this way: with right mindfulness, with right investigation, many of the jobs that are downright dangerous and unwholesome could, in fact, be improved. We can do things better with watching what we're doing. So the example would be then the social worker. If she were more mindful of taking care of the situation rather than taking care of her job position, then she would be better at it. Another example would be, let's say, an evangelical preacher. If he really cared for his flock and did what they needed from him, then that job would be right livelihood. That in fact, even though most of Christianity is metaphor that is sold as reality, if the preachers would leave it as metaphor the way that Jesus did— I mean, he left all of his stuff in the form of parables or stories— if Christianity remained as stories, But in fact, what they say is, is that, oh, if you don't put money in the collection plate, you're going to go to hell. And that puts fear in people. That's not right livelihood, but to take care of people. The next point about the preachers is, is that over the past 50 years, they have become political. And the story used to be in the old days is all You have to get your heart right. And now, the story is, "Oh, you're Christian, your heart's good enough, now let's go do some real damage to women. Let's go do some real damage to Black people. Let's go do some real damage through political action groups." But getting involved with politics, even though we think that we're going to be doing good, we wind up causing problems. An example of that: when I was in Washington, D.C., I was in several buildings that were partially related to each other. One was in the Department of Agriculture, another one was in the Department of the Interior. But there was a pencil drawing that was Xeroxed or copied and was distributed around. There were several of them, but the one that I'm mentioning now is: Imagine a pool, and somebody is standing in the pool a little over waist deep, and they're surrounded by alligators. And the caption of that was: When you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember the original intention was to drain the swamp. All right, well, that's the whole point about Washington, D.C. Everybody comes to Washington, D.C. to drain the swamp, and they wind up becoming alligators because of that issue of it not being right livelihood. That the best way, they think, The best way to get something good done is by harming the people who were trying to prevent it from being done. That's the way that Washington works, that's the way that the court system works, that's the way the police work. In other words, we've got to go harm people who are doing harm. Two wrongs don't make a right. So, your question is, what kind of livelihood then should we do? Well, the answer to that is, when both sides win. When both sides win. An example of that, in fact this is kind of funny, have you ever heard of the Harlem Globetrotters. It was a basketball team.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I've seen them before.

**Speaker A:** All right, they were an exhibition team. What that meant was is that all of the other basketball teams are competitive sport teams. They're out to harm the other team and prevent them from making scores. But the Harlem Globetrotters, they would go to high schools and play a game against the high school basketball team, and the Harlem Globetrotters, being professionals, were so much better than those high school boys, but the high school would always win the game. How is that? Because the Harlem Globetrotters would help them. In some cases, they would even pick the guy up so that he could put the basket in. This is the kind of thing that we can see, is that if we lived our lives with the idea of helping, our opponents, and giving them what they need, then they will actually start dealing with us in the same way. So that we do things to not harm people, we do things to promote joy, to promote benefit. So, now we can go into, well, what kind of jobs then? Have that quality of actually doing something that's of benefit to other people. And one of them that springs to mind is, in Thailand, we have about 400,000 monks, all of them basically unemployed. All of them are unemployed. In fact, when a monk becomes employed at something, he needs to look at what he's doing. So, if the monks are unemployed, then how do they eat? The answer to that is through generosity, with the idea that when they gain food from having the leftovers of what the family ate, then not only does he get the benefit of that, but the family gets benefit from having practiced generosity. They feel good about what they're doing. That in fact, this is the whole point about generosity, is that if the world works not on communism, not on socialism, not on capitalism, but worked on the model of generosity, that we give things away because we don't need them. An example of that would be that a whole neighborhood could have only one lawnmower, with the idea that when somebody needs their grass cut, they know they can find out where the lawnmower is. And if the lawnmower has problems, they'll fix the lawnmower so that they can cut their grass. And then, one lawnmower for the whole neighborhood. And yet, in capitalism, every household has to have their own private lawnmower. So, if the laundromat didn't require any money, and people could go wash their clothes in laundromats, then there wouldn't be so many laundry machines at home. So, if we started looking at it, let's find a way of starting to live our life as a life of generosity. The feeling that you've got, that you're wealthy, you've got more than you need. Let me give it away. All right, so we can— there's many things that we can give away. One of the things that I give away is something that I have, is that a lot of wisdom. It's taken many, many years to get this wisdom, and I'm going to die soon, and then it's going to be gone. It's going to be lost, or it's going to be left on videos if we can get some AI people to watch those videos, or the AI itself, and keep the wisdom going. But I'm giving it away to you so that you can take advantage of that. And I see that you've got a big smile on your face. I think that Castle is enjoying this conversation also. Is to recognize that, can we actually, from the noble mind that we have enough, start living our lives for others, so that they benefit from us, and they don't have to go do things to cause harm in order to make their livelihood? So, this is the way then, ultimately, Right Livelihood in a general sense, is not possible. The noble mindset is just now beginning to get introduced to the West. It's going to take centuries. And in fact, Buddhism has been around in India and in Thailand, and yet Thailand still has criminals. We can't get to everybody. The beauty of the Dhamma and the wisdom of the Dhamma Some people just don't get it. And that's what ordinary society is going to be. Not only do we have criminals in Thailand, we've got police, we've got even a military we don't need, we've got a parliament that we don't need, we've got all these things that we don't need, but people think that we need them, because of the harm that would happen otherwise, and we think that doing harm to those who would cause harm, Two wrongs make a right. The best way of looking at it is, can we find a way of living our lives so that we do the right thing, rather than doing the wrong thing to counteract another wrong? Living our lives is generosity, and everything winds up being free. Way too many cars, way, way too many washing machines, way too much all kinds of stuff, way too many buildings that are not used. I've just heard, in fact, that Amazon bought up huge tracts of houses, forced the people to move out, and now they're just empty because Amazon changed their mind. We have huge amounts of homeless problems, but if we had enough, let us say, an economy of generosity, then people would not be homeless. All of those vacant houses would become open to people, and let them move in. But oh no, it has to do with human greed. And so, you could basically come down to that Second Noble Truth again, And that is, is that ignorant greed causes suffering on a planetary scale. Look at all of these billionaires. I've heard, in fact, that every day more than 1,000 people in the United States become a millionaire. And of that group, every day some people become 10 millionaires. And they want to keep that money, and they'll harm other people in order to get it. And a lot of people are poor, starving, suffering in jobs that they don't like, when in fact, if we would be generous with one another, then how much money somebody had would become irrelevant, and we would all live happily, easily, comfortably, maybe back to an issue of a barter system. Except the bartering itself is always going in one way, in the sense of, oh, you want it? Here, you can have it. I've got, you know, like the Fletcher who has arrows. Oh well, I've just made 100 arrows. If you guys want to go hunting with the arrows, here's the arrows. When you have too many foxes and squirrels that you've shot, bring some to me and we'll all eat well. But that requires us to trust other people in their generosity, or trust that the cosmos is going to take care of me, or that I'll always have enough. That's the feeling of being secure on the inside. And very, very few people have that feeling of internal security. And so that's why we wind up harming other people, because they're harming other people. So how can we change our frame of reference? The way of changing our frame of reference is right back down to the basic practice of Anapanasati. Get yourself into a state of feeling comfortable. At ease, secure, safe, satisfied. And when we keep doing that feeling of safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, we begin to feel a winner. I've got this. I'm on top of the world. I've got what I need. And we keep doing that, and pretty soon we begin to develop the feeling of wealth. I've got more than I need. That drop by drop, the bucket will fill up; but drop by drop, it will overflow also. That the bucket can only hold so much water, and then all the water gets dripped out and overflows. What the Republicans call trickle-down, except the money doesn't trickle down, because instead of letting it trickle down, They'll go get another bucket. Now I've got 2 buckets. Now I've got 10 buckets. I've got 6 yachts, 5 houses, and nothing is trickling down. And the reason for it is because they feel insecure. If that wealthy man felt secure with one bucket, then he wouldn't want to go get a second bucket to keep gathering up more and more water. You could give it away. We would feel wealthy in that regard. But in fact, one of the things that has happened, and we've seen it happen, I don't know how far back into the past, but we can go back a century with the robber barons and the things that happened in the early 20th century, was that a lot of people were getting very, very wealthy. Greed, anger, resentment, wrong versus wrong. Over and over again. And then they get to be old men and they've got this accumulation of wealth. And now what are they going to do with it? Now in their old age, they begin to give it away. And so you have the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, you've got Carnegie Hall, you've got the Biltmores, all of those groups that happened 100 years ago. And now you can see the same thing. [Speaker:Dhammarato] Elon Musk is too young; he's still greedy. Some of the others are too. But the old wealthy ones, an example would be Bill Gates, he's now, in his old age, become quite philanthropic. He gives that money away. He would have been much happier his whole life if he had been giving away all along: to be generous. So you started asking about what is right livelihood, and the answer winds up becoming, your right livelihood is to be generous, to feel like that you're wealthy, that you've got way more than you need, and that will prevent you then from going out and harming people. Hello, Corey! Glad to see you show up. We're just about finished with this talk.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I had some errands and then got some unexpected food poisoning, so I was a little bit preoccupied, but luckily.

**Speaker A:** We were just talking about getting poisoned as wrong livelihood. We're talking about right livelihood and wrong livelihood, and look how much damage is done in the world because of poisons. Look how much damage is done in the world because of weapons. And if we didn't buy and sell weapons, if poison wasn't easy to get a hold of because it wasn't sold, because it wasn't manufactured— I mean, ricin requires a whole lot of work. I don't remember what seed it comes from. But also arsenic, DDT, that stuff has to be really, really worked hard on, pounding it up, making it into a chemical, just so that it can do harm. So, the antidote to this is that if you get the mind noble, then you don't harm people, you don't hurt people. That in fact, when the mind is noble, it's also wealthy, and it winds up being greatly generous. Kathala is actually engaged with one like that, is Ajahn Maitri, that's at the Wat, and Ajahn Maitri is a typical old monk, been a monk for 20 years, and now he's gotten all of his own problems solved completely, and so all he has now to do is to go around helping other people. That's the only thing that he's got left. So when can you come to the point that you've gotten all your problems solved, all of your problems taken care of? In fact, you've gotten this done so well that you're wealthy in your life, and now you can start helping other people, devoting your life to the actual work of doing good rather than doing wrong, in order to counteract wrong. As we said, two wrongs don't make a right, and yet our whole society is built upon that premise of revenge, of getting back, having an argument, making a score, having a war, having a game. Whatever it is, we want to win. Well, guess what? That wanting to win is coming from the victim's position. Oh, I would be better off if I could win this argument or this game or this war. But a real winner, one who has Dharma and has the feeling of that, we can say, "Okay, you can have this one. Oh, I agree with you. Yeah, you're right this time and I'm wrong, so what? That's okay." And so, we give away. That would be the right livelihood. This is the reciprocation of generosity. And so there is an out. Think about that. How can you live your life? So if you're going to go to work at a job, whatever that job is, knowing that it's tainted with Dukkha, at least you can be happy, secure, comfortable in that job, doing it well, and treating everybody around you that way, that you give away generosity, you give your love, your attention, your affection, your good feelings to others. You become generous. So this is the way to have Right Livelihood, is to recognize buying and selling or harm to prevent or to punish harm is not the right way of doing it. The right way of doing it is from a sense of generosity. In that regard, then the used car salesman is going to start giving his cars away. Oh, you need a car? Oh, I've got a whole lot full of them here. Go take one. And remember that I gave it to you so that you could do something nice for me later. So, does anybody have any comments about this? Michael, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much for your generosity, Dhammarato. I really appreciate it. And yeah, we Recently in the Discord, we were talking about generosity and its impact and practicing generosity internally as well. And so, yeah, I just, I really enjoyed this talk. Thank you so much for it.

**Speaker A:** Kat, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** Well, since I'm in a wat, I don't really have the right livelihood question on my mind because I don't actually really do anything anymore. So I kind of just listened to the talk. It was nice, but I remember when I was working a lot that it wasn't really the job that was the problem. It was just that I disliked it. And it was until I kind of thought about respecting the job for what it does for me. That I kind of had a wholesome attitude towards the job, and I was able to kind of just be happy with whatever, you know. Like, it's really just in the attitude you have towards what you're doing. But some things are inherently unwholesome, and some things are inherently harmful. But the way you have the attitude towards what you're doing is really how you're going to feel about it. So that's the kind of main message from what I understood here. It's the right attitude, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Cory, you've been here only a little while. What do you think about what we've been talking about?

**Speaker C:** I think it's a good idea because, you know, in some degree or another, what you put out, you're going to get back. So, you know, it might not be from the same person, but if you practice that generosity, like, you're going to be the recipient of it as well. In one form or another, you know, even if it's just like your own thoughts, or I don't know how it's— but it's not always the same person that you're generous to that you're going to benefit from in the future. But just in general, like, if you kind of have that mentality of, you know, generosity, but not so much that you hate it or that you don't do it in the future, right? You just have a little bit of generosity, uh, enough that feels good for you, feels good for them. It's just beneficial, helps with your peace of mind, and it helps other people too, you know. So it's really good.

**Speaker A:** Great. How about you, Keishon? Do you have anything to say?

**Speaker E:** Oh, I remember.

**Speaker A:** A lot of the.

**Speaker E:** Advice you talked about with the job. And I think I really had taken that to heart a while back.

**Speaker A:** Now I really— Yes, I know we've talked about this before, haven't we?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, and now I really like my job and things are going really well and really excelling at it. Improved on, like you talked about, watching what you're doing and making, improving things.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Great, great. All right, well, thank you guys. Any last words? Go ahead. Other than that, we can go ahead and— go ahead, Cap.

**Speaker D:** I was gonna say, before I came to Thailand, I didn't really have a sense of experience of being a recipient of generosity. I have had like good friends and like people like Dhammarato talk to me, and I had experience of generosity, but before I came to Thailand and had a more like immersed experience of people who are entirely just generous all the time, it really just kind of rubs off on you and you really understand how closing off and keeping everything for yourself is what you kind of learn in the West. To— it's just a natural way of living. But it's, it really— you just start to see how just kind of pointless it is. It really is unwholesome. It doesn't help you or help anyone when you just, when you keep things for yourself. But it's the natural mindset of people living in the West. Like, it seems more natural and doesn't seem right to give away. Like, there's something wrong if you give something away. You actually feel like I'm doing— you're doing something wrong if you give it away.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I might need it someday.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, you might need it, so you store it in the basement. You have a huge basement full of stuff. But giving it away, you really internally feel wealthy, like you really feel like you have way more than what you are gathering up outside. So actually doing it, you eventually feel it. So you have to kind of practice it. It is a practice, I think. Generosity on different levels. Yeah, on different levels, like physical stuff and verbal stuff, saying nice things to people, giving things away, stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yes, um, an interesting phenomenon that I've known, noticed, because I have practiced and tried things for a while, and it's just kind of like, you know, something that I've tried and experimented with. But you could see the reflection of your own kindness in the way that you help other people. So if you're giving out a certain kind of energy, like wholesome and patient and kind and caring, you'll get it back almost immediately from a lot of people. So it's not just that you help them too, like you get it back immediately. A lot of the times. And, um, you know, that's, that's almost a good measuring of how good you're giving, because you give it out. And here's the thing, like, if you are giving out really good energy, if your energy that you're giving out is better or higher than theirs, if it's more desirable, they will drop their energy and they'll pick up on yours. Because it's like, yeah, it's like they want to be feeling better, they want to feel that good energy. So Yeah, like you could tell, you know, the quality of your energy and the quality of your generosity or your kindness or any of the other Paramitas really, any of those good positive wholesome qualities, you'll see it immediately when you do it really good. And then you benefit from it too, you know, so it is a way to help you and other people.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So to end up then Right livelihood is the kind of livelihood to where everybody benefits. And wrong livelihood is when you do something that you don't like to do, but you want something, and so you harm other people in order to get what you want, because what you think that you want is good. When in fact it needs more of an investigation. You can't decide that something is good just because you like it, or something is bad because you don't like it. It takes more of an investigation. And once we investigate, we can recognize then that two wrongs don't make a right. Trying to stop someone from doing harm is harming them. Let's go give them something. Let's go be generous with them. Let's teach them generosity by giving generosity. So thanks, guys. I appreciate it, and we'll see you again.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** Okay, chat with you afterwards. Do you have time? A little bit of time available if you do, but if not, that's cool too.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let us say a little later, that I need to go rest because my hip is hurting, and so I need to take care of it. It's asking. And so— Okay, how about maybe tomorrow? Okay, yeah, call tomorrow. That would be good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, my stomach is just killing me, like out of nowhere. I just had some food and like an hour afterwards, really, really bad. So yeah, I think tomorrow would be good. I actually have some things planned, but later in the evening maybe I'll have some time and I'll send you a message and we'll see.

**Speaker A:** All right, very good. Well, we'll see you.

**Speaker C:** It's good to see you again too. Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** You too. Yes, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, explores the concept of **Right Livelihood** from a nuanced, practice-oriented perspective. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Perspective Shift: From Rules to Noble Mind**
*   Right Livelihood should be understood not just as a rule to follow ("ordinary" view), but as a natural outcome of a "noble" mind—one that is free from wanting and sees clearly.
*   It is deeply connected to **Right Speech** and **Right Action** in the present moment, but viewed over a longer timeframe as one's overall **lifestyle**.

### **The Foundation: A Mind Free of Wanting**
*   The essence of Right Livelihood stems from the mind. If the mind is noble (calm, content, without craving), harmful actions like lying, stealing, or exploitative work become unlikely.
*   A person who "doesn't want anything" needs very little livelihood, simplifying the entire question.

### **Investigating Livelihood with Wisdom, Not Liking**
*   A major pitfall is judging a job as "bad" simply because we dislike it. Our dislike often stems from childhood conditioning (doing things we didn't want to) and is not a reliable indicator of the job's inherent wholesomeness.
*   Similarly, we mistakenly think something is "good" just because we like and want it (e.g., a high salary, a certain person), which is a form of ignorance (*avijja*).
*   The correct criteria for evaluation should be: **Does this activity cause *dukkha* (suffering/harm) or does it fulfill a genuine need?** We must investigate with wisdom, not emotion.

### **Examples of Wrong Livelihood (Causing Harm)**
Dhammarato reviews traditional and modern examples from the suttas and today's world, where the activity itself generates harm:
*   **Buying and Selling for Profit:** Especially when combined as a business model aimed at exploitation (e.g., used car sales with inherent dishonesty).
*   **Dealing in Intoxicants:** (e.g., bartending, alcohol sales) because it leads to widespread suffering.
*   **Dealing in Poisons:** (e.g., harmful pesticides like DDT) that damage health and environment.
*   **Dealing in Weapons:** Manufacturing or selling arms perpetuates violence.
*   **Professions of Coercion & Punishment:** Police, judges (in punitive systems), and politicians often operate on a harmful paradigm of "using harm to stop harm" or revenge, which contradicts the Dhamma principle of rehabilitation and non-harm.
*   **Jobs Tied to Greed & Environmental Harm:** Many industries (e.g., mining, excessive consumer manufacturing) are based on exploitative buying/selling and harm the planet.

### **The Ideal: Livelihood as Generosity**
*   Given that most jobs in conventional society are a mix of wholesome and unwholesome, the ultimate goal is to shift one's internal attitude and the economic model itself.
*   **Right Livelihood is where everybody benefits.** The ideal is moving from a model of capitalism/competition to an **"economy of generosity."**
*   A truly noble mind feels **secure and wealthy internally**, leading to natural generosity—giving away time, resources, wisdom, and kindness without expectation.
*   Examples include: social workers acting from genuine care, teachers, or the model of Buddhist monastics who live on alms, allowing donors to practice generosity.
*   Even in a "tainted" job, one can practice by being happy, doing the work well, and treating everyone with generosity and good will.

### **Practical Takeaways**
1.  **Reframe Your Criteria:** Don't ask "Do I like this job?" Ask "Does this job create net harm or net benefit for myself and others?"
2.  **Cultivate the Noble Mind:** Through meditation (like *ānāpānasati*), develop inner contentment and security. This reduces craving and makes ethical living easier.
3.  **Practice Generosity:** Start giving—possessions, kindness, attention, forgiveness. This creates a mindset of "having enough" and breaks the cycle of greed and fear.
4.  **Aim for "Both Sides Win":** In all interactions, seek outcomes where no one is harmed and all parties benefit, moving away from the competitive "win-lose" paradigm.

The talk concludes by emphasizing that **Right Livelihood is ultimately about living a life where your actions, sustained over time, spring from wisdom and generosity rather than ignorance, greed, or aversion.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several powerful metaphors and illustrative stories to explain the concept of Right Livelihood. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Two Buckets / Trickle-Down Generosity:** This is the central economic metaphor.
    *   **The Image:** A bucket being filled drop by drop until it overflows.
    *   **The Meaning:** With consistent practice (of meditation/generosity), an individual fills their inner sense of security and wealth ("the bucket"). Once you feel truly "full" and secure, any excess naturally overflows to others as generosity.
    *   **The Contrast:** He contrasts this with the failed "trickle-down" economic theory, where the wealthy, instead of letting their excess "overflow," simply get more buckets (yachts, houses), driven by inner insecurity.

2.  **Draining the Swamp & Becoming an Alligator:** A political/career metaphor.
    *   **The Story:** A person standing in a swamp, waist-deep in alligators, forgets their original goal was to *drain the swamp*.
    *   **The Meaning:** People enter systems (politics, policing, law) with noble intentions to fix problems ("drain the swamp"). However, the system's inherent nature—using harm to counteract harm—corrupts them, and they become part of the problem ("become alligators").

3.  **Humanity as a "Skin Rash on the Planet":** An ecological metaphor.
    *   **The Image:** Humanity is a harmful, spreading irritation on the Earth.
    *   **The Meaning:** Our collective greed and "buying and selling" mentality leads to exploitative jobs (mining, deforestation, pollution) that actively harm the ecosystem we depend on.

4.  **The Harlem Globetrotters vs. Competitive Sports:** A metaphor for non-harmful interaction.
    *   **The Story:** The Harlem Globetrotters play exhibition games where they use their superior skill not to crush the opponent (the high school team) but to help them win and have a joyful experience.
    *   **The Meaning:** This illustrates "Right Livelihood" as an activity where all parties benefit, and the goal is upliftment and joy, not defeating or harming another. It's the opposite of a win-lose, competitive mindset.

5.  **Downloading a Movie (Ownership vs. Use):** A metaphor for ignorant craving.
    *   **The Story:** We download a movie we like because we want to own and control it. After watching it once, it just sits as a file, giving us a small pleasure hit when we see it but not real value.
    *   **The Meaning:** This illustrates the deluded cycle of *like -> want -> get/control*. We confuse ownership with lasting happiness. This same delusion applies to choosing jobs for superficial perks (high salary) rather than their true ethical value.

### **Key Illustrative Stories & Examples**

1.  **The Fletcher (Arrow-Maker):** Used to define the core problem of "buying and selling."
    *   The Fletcher gathers materials to make a product *specifically for sale*. This intentional trade is contrasted with buying something for personal use and later selling it. The story grounds the abstract rule in a tangible, ancient profession.

2.  **Childhood Conditioning (Peas, Broccoli, Homework):**
    *   A story to explain why we tolerate jobs we dislike. We are conditioned from childhood to do things we don't want to do because of external rules ("you're supposed to"). This habit carries into adulthood, making it hard to discern if a job is ethically wrong or just personally unpleasant.

3.  **The Manhattan Project:**
    *   Cited as the ultimate example of a job that seemed intellectually compelling but had catastrophic, long-term harmful consequences the workers could not foresee. It represents the danger of jobs divorced from ethical foresight.

4.  **The Bartender vs. Psychologist:**
    *   A direct story to challenge justification. A bartender might say they help people by listening to their troubles. The speaker argues that if helping is the goal, be a psychologist—don't enable the harm of alcohol to create the opportunity to help.

5.  **Elon Musk's Trajectory:**
    *   Used as a modern, complex case study. He engages in potentially "right" livelihood (electric cars, sustainable energy) but uses the wealth and power gained to cause harm (Twitter manipulation, aiding conflict). The story shows how even "good" industries can be tainted and how livelihood must be judged by net effect, not just the product.

6.  **The Old Wealthy Philanthropist (Rockefeller, Gates):**
    *   A narrative arc about the journey from greed to generosity. "Robber barons" accumulate wealth through harmful means (wrong livelihood) but often, in old age, turn to philanthropy. The moral is that life would have been happier and more righteous if generosity, not accumulation, had been the guiding principle all along.

7.  **The Monk's Alms Round:**
    *   Presented as an ideal model of non-harming livelihood. The monk is "unemployed" and lives on generosity. This act provides food for the monk and, crucially, provides the *donor* with the spiritual benefit of practicing generosity. It’s a reciprocal system of giving that avoids the harm inherent in commercial exchange.

### **Overall Narrative Metaphor**
The entire talk is structured around a **journey from ignorance to wisdom**:
*   **Starting Point:** The "ordinary" view of livelihood as a set of rules and personal likes/dislikes.
*   **Path:** Investigating the real-world **harm** caused by professions (weapons, poison, police, predatory sales).
*   **Obstacle:** The societal myth that "two wrongs make a right" (harming the harmful is justified).
*   **Destination/Goal:** A lifestyle of **generosity**, where inner wealth and security allow one to transform livelihood into an act of giving, creating a system where "everybody benefits."

These metaphors and stories effectively translate the Buddhist precept of Right Livelihood from a abstract rule into a practical, critical lens for examining economics, personal career, and social structure.
