### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes, so Tommy, it appears over and over and over again that much of the, let us say, the slowness with the practice that people have is because they want too much. That the intensity of the desire is high, and that what we're looking for is to bring that intensity of the desire down to a very, very easy level. Okay? That it's true, and I have seen it often, that people work themselves up, that that's It happens very often in the Mahasi method that people work themselves up, work too hard. I see it often. In fact, I just responded this morning to a student that was here 3 years ago. He's a really, really old student, but he still wants way too hard. He wants too much. And because of that, he's not making much progress. And so the whole point about being satisfied then is that we really are satisfied and we don't want anything because this is good enough. But often I've heard people use the word satisfied, saying that they're satisfied, when in fact they're not. And it's fairly easy to prove to them, though that's not necessarily a good idea, it'll piss them off too. You've heard that expression from Jesus, 'Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.' Gloria Steinem has an extra line for that, 'Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, but first it's going to piss you off.' Okay, and so this is the part that I'm talking about, is that you're not nearly as satisfied as The indication that I'm talking about, about satisfaction, we need to really practice satisfaction. Anicca, in the sense of being completely satisfied, means that you don't want anything at all. Yeah, out of the practice, that now your practice is the practice of being happy that the practice is going so well, that you begin to develop the attitude of a winner. We've got this, if that's where we're going with it. And that you're still in the position of wanting something, that you're not fulfilled yet, that you're still trying to reconnect with something. And that part of the recommendation is stop trying to reconnect with anything. There's nothing to reconnect to other than a concept or a rule or an idea that you've got in the mind. That you're already okay the way that you are. But that's also taught quite often in Zen, because the Zen people, they want way too much. And the answer then is that you're already enlightened. Sit down and relax. It's sort of like the game is over, the race in fact has been won. But we're still out on the track because we don't recognize that we've already run the race. Yeah, in fact, we add extra things that I really haven't run until I pace that second place guy. I gotta completely lap him, and until I lap him, I really haven't won the race yet. These are the kind of games that we play with ourselves. Okay, right, right. And so even winning winds up being not good enough. So really the habit is the habit of the feeling that we haven't succeeded, that we haven't gotten what we're looking for yet. We're still wanting something. We're still incomplete.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've taken recently to trying to.

**Speaker C:** See.

**Speaker B:** Any dissatisfaction at all.

**Speaker C:** Any frustration, any desire to be anywhere else than where I am, and just relaxing that. And that feels very— yeah, that feels very— I see things that I didn't even realize were there, small dissatisfactions or— yeah.

**Speaker A:** I use often the analogy of a camera, that when the camera is very stable, it takes better pictures. And that's especially true when our— let us say the film that's in the camera is not a high-quality film. But as we practice that twofold quality, one is that we begin to settle down and be very still so that we can see what's going on. And then also we can see better. Sort of like we get a better lens, a better film, okay? And so we have to practice getting that stability so that we can see straight. And that stability actually does come from the feeling of satisfaction, because if we're dissatisfied a little bit, then we want to keep changing things around, keep moving it around, keep fixing it, okay, when there's nothing broken.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so letting ourselves get very stable and happy, and then something will occur, some trigger, some thought, and that will bring up emotions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And the point is, is that we're here to learn to take control of those emotions. And I would imagine that, for instance, getting hot and bothered, or starting to cry, or getting anxious or uptight, or any of those kind of feelings then, is not desirable. And yet we still are out of control of our feelings. So the whole practice actually of Anapanasati is to begin to talk ourselves into feeling the way that we want to feel. And experiment with that. That in fact, that's a very unusual thing. Nobody's ever kind of hear that for a while, in the sense that we often say, well, I feel what I feel, that that's it. Not only that, but I do what I feel, right? I do what I feel means that we are out of control. We can't do the right thing or what we want to do. We got to do according to how we feel. And many people then in that regard, they begin to make the mistake of, I am what I feel. And you're not what you feel. But most people are ignorant, and because they are ignorant, they wind up thinking that who they are is how they feel, and that they really don't have any control over how they feel. That that's just the way I feel, is the kind of thing that they say, right? And so it's quite unusual for me to talk about that you can feel the way that you want it to feel, because you've never quite really experimented with how do you want to feel.

**Speaker B:** So when these thoughts arise, when these.

**Speaker C:** Thoughts arise of, let's say, provocative or emotion emotionally charged memories or thoughts, and maybe that wants to— that inspires some kind of feeling or tenderness or crying or emotion or anything like that, the correct response would be to observe it and kind of sort of release attachment to it rather than lean into it. Is that right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, to not be attached to it, to not see that it's a job to do. Then in fact, that's a kind of a rule. You're supposed to lean into it or try to fix it.

**Speaker C:** I think that's the rule I've made for myself, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Rather than relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** And not even relax into it, just relax. My dad had a favorite saying. He didn't even understand the depth of what he was saying, but he was also a day laborer in the sense that he, you know, blue-collar worker. He did a lot of walking, a lot of meter reading, a lot of tearing stoves apart and that kind of stuff. Okay. But one of the things that he had to say, which was kind of a joke, is, "Work? I'm not afraid of work." Okay, and he would say that because he thought I was kind of lazy, that I was afraid of work or something like that. And so he would say, work? I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside it and take a nap. I'm not afraid of work. Okay, so this is actually how we need to take the idea about how we feel and say, oh, I don't care how I feel. I'm not afraid of how I feel. I can lay down and take a nap beside my bad feelings. I could relax. Okay, and so in that regard, we're not saying relax into them, but that's normally the way that we express it. But the real issue is that we can see it, aha, I see you, Mara, and then we can change that back into the wholesome thought, which in this case is just relax, just relax. Okay, yeah, there's nothing to do and no place to go. We don't have to lean into it. We don't have to change it. That's the only real change is our attitude towards it, which means making friends with it. I'm already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I definitely see a fork in the road whenever this familiar feeling— this, it's almost a warmth or a tenderness in the chest.

**Speaker C:** That arises.

**Speaker B:** Then there's a fork in the road, and the fork is I can either kind of push slightly into that and.

**Speaker C:** Then my eyes will start watering, or.

**Speaker B:** I can just sort of let the.

**Speaker C:** Breath roll on through and kind of just relax through it. And it sort of bypasses it, I guess, in the way that you're describing it. I relax out of it and into it.

**Speaker A:** Right. And this is why it's so good to use that phrase, or something close to it: Aha, I see you, Mara.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been saying that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, just, I see that. And now there's nothing to it, there's nothing to do. Let me just take a deep breath. But in fact, most of the anxiety will go away when we approach it like that, that if there is some thought that creates or causes anxiety and then we don't like the anxiety, the not liking of the anxiety is the very chemical processing system that keeps the anxiety going. Yeah, but if we have the attitude of, oh, there's that anxiety, let me nourish it and give it some love and care and stop trying to beat it. Okay, so if you try to flog that anxiety, it's just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. But if you nurture it, if you nurture yourself, it's okay, it's all right, I can relax, just relax, and keep talking about the relaxing. And maybe the tears come to the eyes, but that's all, that's enough. And I can take a deep breath and smile and be happy.

**Speaker B:** If the tears do come in this context when I am just trying to.

**Speaker C:** Relax and just be happy, then that's okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now when you say the word cry or tears or sobbing, they're all different. That boohoo and sobbing, I'm assuming, is not what you're talking about. You're talking about more moist eyes.

**Speaker B:** It can be.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (Speakers B & C), centers on a core obstacle in meditation practice: **excessive desire and effort**, and the antidote: **genuine satisfaction and relaxation.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Core Problem: Wanting Too Much**
*   The primary barrier to progress is not laziness, but **over-efforting**—an intense desire for results (enlightenment, specific experiences). This is compared to practitioners in the Mahasi method and Zen who "work themselves up."
*   This creates a hidden, persistent **dissatisfaction**—a feeling of being incomplete, of not having "won the race" yet, even when one claims to be satisfied.

**2. The Antidote: Cultivating True Satisfaction**
*   The goal is to **lower the intensity of desire** to an "easy level."
*   True practice becomes the "practice of being happy that the practice is going so well." One must develop the **attitude of a winner**—the race is already won, you are already okay as you are. There is "nothing to reconnect to" but concepts.
*   This is framed as deeply understanding **Anicca (impermanence)** in the sense of being "completely satisfied" and wanting nothing.

**3. Practical Application: Stability and Non-Reactivity**
*   **Analogy of a Camera:** A stable camera takes a better picture. Similarly, a mind settled in **satisfaction and stability** can see reality clearly. Dissatisfaction causes constant mental "fidgeting" and adjustment when nothing is broken.
*   The purpose of stability is to clearly see triggers (thoughts, memories) that arise and to **learn to take control of your emotional response** to them.

**4. Revolutionary Insight: You Can Choose How to Feel**
*   A core teaching is that we are **not our feelings** ("you're not what you feel"). Most people believe they have no control and "do what they feel."
*   **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** is presented as an experiment in learning to "talk ourselves into feeling the way we want to feel."

**5. How to Handle Difficult Emotions**
*   When provocative thoughts or emotions arise (sadness, anxiety, tenderness), the correct response is **not to "lean into" or "fix" them**, but to **observe and release attachment**.
*   The instruction is to simply **relax**. Use phrases like **"Aha, I see you, Mara"** to acknowledge the distraction without engaging with it.
*   **Key Mechanism:** Resisting or disliking an emotion (e.g., anxiety) is the very "chemical processing system" that fuels it. Instead, **nurture it with a relaxed, friendly attitude**—"it's okay, I can relax." This allows it to dissipate.
*   **Example:** For a feeling of warmth/tenderness in the chest, one can choose the "fork in the road" of relaxing and letting the breath "roll on through" rather than pushing into it and triggering tears. If gentle tears come from a place of relaxation, that's fine; the issue is the compulsive "leaning in."

**In essence,** the talk advises letting go of the striving, goal-oriented mindset. True progress comes from settling into a deep, relaxed satisfaction with the present moment, which creates the stable and clear mind needed for insight. The practice is one of **gentle, friendly disengagement** from emotional storms, not one of forceful combat or analysis.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching about reducing desire and practicing satisfaction in meditation. Here are the key ones:

### Metaphors:
1.  **The Race/Winning:** The speaker describes a common mental trap using the metaphor of a race that has already been won.
    *   *Quote:* "It's sort of like the game is over, the race in fact has been won. But we're still out on the track because we don't recognize that we've already run the race... I gotta completely lap him, and until I lap him, I really haven't won the race yet."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how the mind creates moving goalposts and cannot accept that it is already "okay" or "complete," turning even success into dissatisfaction.

2.  **The Camera:** The speaker uses the analogy of a camera to explain the importance of mental stability and clarity.
    *   *Quote:* "I use often the analogy of a camera, that when the camera is very stable, it takes better pictures... we begin to settle down and be very still so that we can see what's going on. And then also we can see better. Sort of like we get a better lens, a better film."
    *   **Purpose:** To show that satisfaction creates the stable, clear "platform" (the steady camera) from which we can observe experience accurately. Dissatisfaction causes us to fidget and "blur the picture."

### Stories & Anecdotes:
1.  **The Old Student:** The speaker begins with a brief story about a specific, long-time student.
    *   *Quote:* "I just responded this morning to a student that was here 3 years ago. He's a really, really old student, but he still wants way too hard... because of that, he's not making much progress."
    *   **Purpose:** To ground the teaching in a real, relatable example, showing that the problem of excessive wanting is common and persistent even among experienced practitioners.

2.  **The Modified Quote (Gloria Steinem/Jesus):** The speaker references and then extends a famous biblical quote.
    *   *Quote:* "You've heard that expression from Jesus, 'Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.' Gloria Steinem has an extra line for that, 'Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, but first it's going to piss you off.'"
    *   **Purpose:** To humorously acknowledge the difficulty of facing the uncomfortable truth that we are not as "satisfied" as we claim to be, and that this realization can be irritating before it is liberating.

3.  **The Father's Joke ("I'm not afraid of work"):** The speaker recounts a personal anecdote about his father's saying.
    *   *Quote:* "My dad had a favorite saying... 'Work? I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside it and take a nap.'... this is actually how we need to take the idea about how we feel and say, 'oh, I don't care how I feel. I'm not afraid of how I feel. I can lay down and take a nap beside my bad feelings.'"
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a memorable, earthy, and practical attitude for dealing with difficult emotions: not fighting them, but dis-identifying and relaxing *alongside* them without being consumed by them.

4.  **"I see you, Mara":** While not a full story, the speaker repeatedly invokes this classic Buddhist reference.
    *   *Quote:* "we can see it, *aha, I see you, Mara*... this is why it's so good to use that phrase."
    *   **Purpose:** To frame distracting thoughts and emotions as "Mara" (the personification of temptation and death in Buddhism), turning them into an impersonal phenomenon to be acknowledged with detachment rather than a problem to be solved.

### Summary of Core Teaching Through These Devices:
The metaphors and stories collectively reinforce the central instruction: **Progress in meditation is hindered by intense desire and dissatisfaction.** The path is to cultivate genuine satisfaction and stability (the **steady camera**), recognizing you are already okay (the **race already won**). When difficult emotions arise, don't fight or "lean into" them; instead, adopt an attitude of relaxed, dis-identified allowance (like **lying down beside work**), acknowledging them without being controlled by them (**"I see you, Mara"**). This shift from striving to accepting is simple but challenging, as it confronts our ingrained habits (**the old student**, the **truth that first pisses you off**).
