### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I'll do my best.

**Speaker B:** All right, has anybody got an idea that the call has started?

**Speaker C:** I do see the red dot.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is your Friday evening call in the U.S. It's, uh, Thailand Saturday morning. Glad to see you, Emil. Welcome. We've got a lot of group today. We've got some new faces and missing some old ones. I'm glad to see Dhamma Das back again, and Brett, been a long time, long time. Good to see you, DJ.

**Speaker C:** Good to see you.

**Speaker B:** Good to be here, Robert. You've got a question about dealing with people in social environments, so go ahead and tell us about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, um, like you said, it's, um, to bring joy and stuff to the social interaction and to bring, um, positivity and Dharma and wholesomeness and spread joy. But sometimes I worry that, um, if I bring enough joy to the interaction, that people, um, you know, they'll start to show me their pain, you know, their real pain. And it can be difficult to know.

**Speaker C:** How to.

**Speaker A:** Like, how to navigate that and deal with their pain with them. And I worry that I'll make an error and just make it like.

**Speaker D:** I.

**Speaker A:** Won'T do it skillfully enough and then, you know, I could put myself in danger. So how do you overcome that or how do you like spread, how do you not deal with that worry when you're spreading like joy and stuff to people?

**Speaker B:** Well, let's make this an open discussion. In fact, Robert, you gave me the idea by actually asking DJ. So DJ, what do you have to say about what he's talking about?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so it is an interesting situation, and I think that it's something where, you know, there's a couple of things that we could really work with here. Number one is, especially when talking about, you know, intense, you know, we might perceive it as intense emotions from like others and what have you. Is we don't have to pick that up. So we can be there for somebody, we can listen to them, but we don't have to necessarily pick that up. That has been something that I have seen to be, you know, really, you know, powerful, right? Is that, hey, you know what, I can be here for this person, I can like listen, and you know, in that way too, that can be spreading the joy, right? So being patient, sometimes maintaining a noble silence, right, at the appropriate time. And then when, you know, the time comes, right, if we're kind of getting some Dharma in there, right, is presenting it like a gift, right, and in a timely way. Now, in terms of worrying about doing that, I think it's helpful too to not have like a way out there super high expectation either, right, like putting a super high standard in like something where there's like a lot of anxiety and perhaps even clinging that can come from that. So again, it's coming back to analyzing, you know, our own mind, you know, noticing those states and arriving at joy there, because we can't really help, you know, others arrive at joy if we're not in joy, right? So.

**Speaker B:** Well, Brad, I haven't seen you for a while. Do you have any comments to make about Robert's question.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think just to add to what DJ was saying, I think when we worry, I know from personal experience, it's I'm leaning into the future. And when we approach the needs of others in pain, if we can advert equanimity, as DJ was skillfully describing, then we can do so instantaneously. And so we don't really have to ruminate beforehand. We are available. I think DJ language— in fact, it happened this morning, and it happened in a way that was random and serendipitous. I went over to Discord, and I woke up this morning, and I couldn't— I had these Vedanas, I had these feeling tones of I was sad, and there was no apparent cause. In the mind. Maybe it was just the body, but I was sad. And I just, you know, those— I was— that was happening. And I noticed that DJ had asked me, he just said, hey, Brett, how's life? And it was, I think it was about 7:30 PM last night. And so I began texting on Discord and Maybe he wasn't aware of my emotional content. It was just a discussion, but it just occurred in a timely manner. It's one of those things where before long I was generating joy on my own. Other experiences arising, and it was just— yeah. So it's difficult to enumerate and put into language, but I think DJ did so skillfully. I can't add too much.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you, Brett. Uh, Michael, do you have something to add? He was here just a second ago. How about you, Dhamma Das? Another Robert.

**Speaker F:** I just— it just reminded me of a, uh, of Ram Dass quote where he said, suffering because other people are suffering does neither them or us any good. So we can have compassion when others are suffering, but try not to get like stuck in it with them, you know, like putting on the life raft so we don't drown with them. That's what that reminded me of.

**Speaker C:** But anyways.

**Speaker E:** One suffers, then two suffers. No, that's not necessary.

**Speaker C:** Aham.

**Speaker B:** Eamon, how about you? Do you have something to add?

**Speaker G:** I would say something between open-hearted giving and your analogy, Dhammarato, about pumping iron. If it hurts, maybe it's too early. Like, I would help with things I can. Something is hurting me, maybe I'm not ready to help.

**Speaker B:** Something's happened with my cell phone, making a lot of noise. So anyway, Michael, do you have something to say?

**Speaker D:** I kind of ran off to give my son something. He was calling me, so I lost a little bit. I lost track of the topic a little bit. I do have you guys in my ear.

**Speaker B:** We're talking about when other people are suffering, it's hard to add.

**Speaker G:** Joy.

**Speaker D:** I guess my first response to that would just be something I heard Ram Dass say a long time ago, because he used to, as a practice, sit with people who are dying. And he said that, you know, when he first started doing that, that he would try to cheer them up, and he eventually found that that was not the appropriate response. And so he instead started to go in almost as like empty space just like be around them, like create like an empty space of peace within himself and just allow them to be in whatever state that they're in and be sort of like, just like, I guess you could say like an energy of peace and he would allow their pain to come into him and kind of filter back out as peace, not try to change the way they feel or the way that they think. And just to be a peaceful presence, almost as like a meditation practice himself. And then he would find that over time that that would be a better way to ease their suffering than to try to make them happy.

**Speaker B:** So Robert, what do you.

**Speaker E:** Think?

**Speaker B:** What you've been hearing useful to you?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sorry. I like what you said there, Michael, about just staying in like a state of peace and using that to help people to come into that space of peace with you without there needing to be a back and forth sharing or like a sharing of joy, and then they'll open up to that potentially and then show you some pain that's a bit like it can be a threatening situation because you might respond to it wrong or whatever. So I like that. Suggestion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I'll, I'll, I'll try and work with that going forward.

**Speaker B:** Okay, good, Robert. Let me see if I can add a little of something to this. The first thing to say, which is just an old cliché, is misery loves company. That when people have a problem on their mind, they want to go tell somebody. Also, when we figure something out that's been bothering us, we want to go tell somebody. I'm sure that each one of you have experienced that. Who can I say this to? Example would be, oh, we've got new puppies. Who can I go tell we've got new puppies? When Poonpui died, I wanted to go tell people that she died. You know, we want to go share with others, and we all want that kind of space. The question is, is the response that we get from someone else. And so we can look at this situation from both sides, okay? We're either the one that wants to tell all about it, or we're the ones who have to hear all about it. And in the case that you're in, Robert, right now, you're talking about it from the side of having to hear all about it, and that this is the point where most of the time it's the Dhamma dudes that have to put up with listening to other people's stuff. And as I said, misery loves company. They want to tell us all about it. So it becomes almost an art, a skill to develop of how to handle people when they're in their pity party. Now, the Buddha actually gave an example of this. And that he actually demonstrated the example over and over and over again. But before I really got into Buddhism, I'd already been pretty deep into psychology. And there we had found some of the psychologists were actually putting a framework around this, or giving let us say, labeling the process that the Buddha actually demonstrated. And that is the concept of pacing and leading. That the way that we can handle it, if we've got our wits about us, rather than falling into their pity party, we just mention that their pity party has validity. An example of that would be that, let us say, the woman lost her daughter, a child that she had had for years but was still a child, and the child died, and the mother was really, really grief-stricken. And everybody came to comfort her, but her position was, nobody knows the trouble I'm seeing, nobody knows my sorrow. And then a man came and talked to her, and he shared with her that he had lost a son of about the same age. And that's what helped her make the connection with him. This is called the leading part— excuse me, the pacing part— that we have to pace them. We have to find a way to get community with them so that they will accept us when we try to drag them out of their mess. So it's a two-step process, the pacing and then leading. And that if we can find a way of comforting the person, or at least we can agree with them 'Wow, what a mess you're in,' or 'Yes, they did you wrong.' This in fact may even be a little white lie, and we would call them little white lie because it doesn't really matter what we say. The point is, is to get them to open their door because they see you as familiar. They see you as in the same shape. That they're in. This allows us to get in there and pace with them and move along with them. And then once we do this, we can move them out of it. Now let me give you a really, really bizarre example of this. This happened back in the 1960s when they still had mental institutions, when they still locked people up for not behaving the way society wanted them to. There is a kind of disease, a mental illness, that is called catatonic schizophrenia. Have anybody ever heard of that term? Catatonic schizophrenia basically means that the person is so afraid that they won't even move. They're paralyzed with fear. And that, Robert, this is something that I'm wanting to point out to you because I can see that sometimes you feel like that you're paralyzed with fear. Not enough to get locked up for it, but certainly you don't know where to go or what to do. And so you kind of freeze, you do nothing. Now, this is a better— or let us say, a different situation than what DJ was mentioning. About sometimes the best thing to do is to keep your mouth shut. But keeping your mouth shut when actually you want to talk is completely different from being frozen in fear. So these guys, by the way, named Bandler and Grinder, were the ones who worked with a Let us say he was a hypnotist, but he was excellent. His name was Milton H. Erickson, and these two psychologists studied him and came up with a system they call NLP, or Neuro Linguistic Programming, because that in fact is what hypnotists, really good ones, medical kind of hypnotists, can get in there. Getting in there, by the way, is the pacing so that they can help reprogram the linguistic way that the mind functions. So this is neuro-linguistic programming, NLP. I'm sure that everybody's heard about this. All right, so using the techniques of Milton H. Erickson, these two psychologists, Bandler and Grinder, walk into this cell where this catatonic was frozen. Now, back in those days, they didn't have video cameras, but what they did know, the people who were, let us say, the workers on the ward could hear noises coming through his— from his room. But when they would knock on his door or open his door, they would find him sitting Frozen. He was literally petrified of being around anybody else. And so Banner and Grinder took this on as kind of a project, and this is how they handled it. They walked into the room. One of them stood in the corner, kind of, you know, out of sight, out of mind, and the other one sat down across the room or close to this guy. And took exact— he started mimicking him, taking the exact same posture. And over a few minutes of time, this guy became curious. His curiosity actually was able to outweigh his fear. And when they noticed that he had started to move just a little bit They waited a little while longer, let that curiosity grow, and then back in the '60s, you know, before tobacco and all of that, the guy who was sitting doing the miming or the mimicking, he reached into his pocket, pulled out a pack of cigarettes, opened it up, took a light, and then handed the pack of cigarettes over to the catatonic. And the catatonic actually took a cigarette. They had stayed in the room long enough and been doing nothing at all that he became a bit familiar with them. So that was the pacing part. And then putting his hand out with the cigarettes was the leading part. And we see this with the Buddha a lot. In fact, the The place where a lot of people get confused about Buddhism is when the Buddha will take that pacing role to agree with people on any kind of stuff that they want to come up with. He was especially good with the Brahmins because he had a teacher when he was a very young kid. He studied all of the Vedas and all of the literature and everything like that and was quite a scholar, and so he knew the Brahmins stick about as well as they did. And so if he has those kind of people who were coming to him, they're not necessarily asking advice. They're more there to argue with him or to do things like that or to share their problems and stuff. And he takes the opportunity then to feed back to them all of the stuff that they already know and believe. This is the pacing part. And then he will kind of turn the tables on them, set things upside down, and they will follow along with him when he's leading them into the Dhamma so that they can begin to see it. And then At the end of almost all the suttas, they will say, I will become a lay follower of the Buddha for the rest of my life, because he was actually able to straighten things out for them. All right, so Robert, you can actually take this as kind of a big experiment for yourself, and all of you can, is the next time that you have somebody who's in a pity party You can crawl into that pity party with them wisely, correctly, knowing that you're in a two-step process rather than just falling into their pity party and commiserating with them and having the pity party and feeling miserable. Oh, that bank is a really bad place, or oh, that political party over there is terrible. Or whatever their misery is about. If somebody dies, you've had somebody die too. All right, so this is the way that we do it, but we are doing it wisely. And after we gained their confidence, then we can start to move it, start to change it, start to drag them out of it. And how we do that is generally the starting of the leading, in our case, in our society, is to do it with a little bit of a joke, to start bringing some humor into it, to crack a smile. And this is the way that we can start to bring somebody out of their misery. That in fact this is— we've been talking about the Brahma Viharas from time to time— this is actually then the way of the Brahma Viharas, that you go into that room with the catatonic because you actually have some friendship, you have some camaraderie, you have Metta, and then this is where the Karuna comes in, is that you start to pace them You start to have the compassion for them, and then the Mudita, the third one, is then the leading them out of it, the sympathetic joy, that you start having your joy come up and that will help them to come out of it. That if you do the leading too quickly, they will resist it. Then in fact, that's another option that we can take. And that is, is that when somebody comes to us with a pile of grief, we can answer that with joy. Oh, start telling those jokes immediately. Oh, ain't it awful? Oh, wow, you're in such misery. Wow, you're hurting so badly. And you say that with a great big grin. They're not going to take that very well, but you can keep your joy going. You can spend the time long enough to bring them out of their suffering, bring them out of it by teasing them about it. They're going to get angry. They really will. I've been that way myself until finally the dam of anger busts, it breaks up, and we see the wisdom and the humor of what somebody is saying. And in fact, I've seen Achan Po do that with me, that he would tease me a little bit about whatever I had going. So these are the two ways of doing it. One is to do the pacing and the leading, and the other one is to smother them with joy, friendship, gratitude, look at the bright side of life, all of that. By the way, there's an old joke about this, and that is that the guy is saying, "I was just in bad shape, miserable, hurting, everything was horrible, and he said to me, 'Cheer up, things could get worse.' And so I cheered up, and sure enough, Things got worse. So, if you try to cheer somebody up, they will get worse. But you can keep working with it, you can keep with your joy, you can stay with it, and they will eventually come out of it. You can start asking them, "What are the good things that you have in life?" You can— if you know something about them, you can already point that out to them, that you've got a good job and everything is cool. You know, why don't you cool out, mate? And they're grumpy, grumpy, grumpy, grumpy, grumpy some more. And you can keep pointing out everything is all right, everything is cool, and pretty soon they'll start to buy that, right? Because— go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Sorry, but I mean Because you're sincere, and how long can you really hide sincerity? How long can you hide authenticity? Or if you're honest, it's not going to stay hidden.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's true, depending upon your skill level. Yeah, well, that in fact, this is something that would be the job of a very, very skillful psychotherapist. And by the way, I don't find many of them, but I'm not out looking anyway. But I would say that Bandler and Grinder, using their method, helps give psychotherapists a great deal of skill in being able to know when to come out of the pacing into the leading. It takes a lot of observation of who you're working with. And so I would then say maybe that the way to do this is, is that if you have good skill, you can do the pacing and the leading. But if your skill level is not that great, then just smother them with joy. Just smother them with it. They'll get angry. Sure. Give them some more joy. Don't give them a teaspoon of sugar to help the medicine go down. Give them a backhoe shovel full of it.

**Speaker E:** Funnel it in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Just keep putting it on. Yeah, everything. I hear you. I hear how miserable you are. You— I don't see it, you know. And so this is the way that you can begin to handle this. So Robert, what would you prefer? Would you prefer all joy all the time, or the pacing and meeting method? I don't hear you. Never mind. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Don't freeze up on us now. You're not on the spot. Everything's all right, everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Pacing and leading, it sounds more gentle and gradual.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is. It takes some time. And it takes some skill. And so the question is, are you willing to put that kind of skill, effort into it?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** That's where your Metta comes from, your kindness. If you have the real kindness, you can take that opportunity to get in there with them so that you can grab them by the hand and lead them out of their misery, lead them out of their fear. So DJ, do you have anything to say about this?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think it's really wonderful that you brought up that pacing and leading sort of method and, you know, kind of meeting people where they're at and then slowly, you know, sprinkling in the joy. And I think that there's something else that's really helpful, which is confidence in this, having the confidence that, hey, we can do this, having the confidence that, hey, we're not going to crack, you know, we can do this.

**Speaker B:** The skill and the knowing that you've got the skill to be able to do it. Yes, because the other possibility is that you go in there to fix a situation and you wind up being a part of the situation. Which actually reminds me of the thing that I saw when I was staying at Wat Thai Washington For some reason, some of the politicians just wanted to take the monks all over the place. So we went to the Library of Congress and we went to the Smithsonian and we went to several offices. Most of it was in the Agriculture Department. But there I saw several occurrences of the same Xerox line drawing. And what it was, it was a line drawing of a pond with a guy standing in the middle of it, surrounded by alligators on all four quarters. And the caption of the photo, or the line drawing, was: "When you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp." OK? In fact, they've talked about draining the swamp in Washington now since the 1970s, I think. By the late 1980s, I had already seen this sign. So that sign's been around there, and it's actually become quite a cliché in Washington of draining the swamp. But what they don't actually point out was, is that you are there to drain the swamp, but the alligators who were already in Washington are preventing you from draining the swamp. But 10 years later, after being in Washington, you wind up being one of the alligators. You've been in the swamp so long, you become a swamp creature, the creature from the Black Lagoon. So this is, this is the problem of the issue of the skill level. Can you go into that swamp to drain it for somebody without becoming one of the alligators that is there to prevent the swamp from being strained? So I agree with you 100% on that, DJ, that it has to do with your level of confidence. And if you don't have the— go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I was just going to add that. Yeah, that goes with like a discernment though, in terms of like understanding like, okay, you know, having that confidence that like, yes, we can help out in this situation and like continuing with that, but also understanding like if we're not quite at that level, it might be wiser to take a different course of action. Like remove ourselves from the situation. I think this is why like the value of getting into seclusion is so helpful, especially if you're kind of living more like a householder life, right? And so having that time to get into seclusion to clear out the mind so that our Sati, right, is sharp, that we have the wakefulness to actually do this. Because when we are in that swamp, we have to keep remembering, coming back to, hey, we are in the swamp. Being aware of what we, you know, what our intentions are here and not to get lost, right?

**Speaker E:** These are momentary qualities. We can't have confidence as a solid, but we can create that mental formation, and our Sati is necessary for those moments and to be there, for awareness to be there, to form confidence.

**Speaker B:** Michael, do you have something to say?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I would say that for me, I find like the non-self perception to be useful in this case, which is the way that I use it is not to make a distinction between thoughts, perceptions, beliefs, opinions, feelings going on internally within me and the thoughts, perceptions, beliefs, and opinions mental states being like expressed and vocalized around me, and to have sort of an equal, an equal disenchantment towards wherever it's arising. Like it's all awareness.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker D:** Here'S anger arising in this location, maybe somebody's projecting anger towards me. That's no different than anger arising in this location, anger arising in my own mind. My job is to use the non-self perception to break the process of identification wherever something unwholesome is arising, and just to maintain a state of equal awareness in all situations. You brought up the householder life. You know, I'm a householder, I have a job, and so that's the only way I've found to create a cohesion or a unity in my practice from one moment to the next is to sort of try to maintain that perception of non-self through all of my activities.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker D:** You guys hear the baby waking up?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** The 2-year-old is now in the bath. And the baby is waking up. But just so you know, I can hear you guys because I have an earpiece in my head. So when I walk away, I'm still following the conversation.

**Speaker B:** Okay. One example, by the way, of that pacing and leading is the sutta about Gashi, Gotama, I think. I've forgotten how to pronounce the name, maybe someone will come up with it. But she had her baby to die, and she could not accept that the baby was dead, and she carried the corpse around with her to various doctors, Ayurvedic doctors, and nobody could do anything about that. And so, she came to the Buddha, and he applied this two-step method. And the pacing that he gave her was because she was looking for magic. He said, you go around to houses and get one aniseed. Sometimes they translated as mustard seed and get just one mustard seed. Very cheap. No problem. Every house has got aniseed and mustard in those days. But the catch is And this is where he starts the leading part, is that each household that you go to, only accept a mustard seed if they have never known death in that family. And so she went out with her corpse of a baby and went around, and when she finally did come back to the Buddha, she came back without the corpse. She had figured out that the baby was dead and that everybody knows death. Now you can imagine, what will you do if somebody knocked on your door and you answered the door and there is a woman who is asking for an aniseed because she's going to take it to the Buddha to perform a special magic trick to bring the baby back to life? But that the only reason that she wants an anicca seed from you is because your house has never known death. And so I can imagine some of the conversations that happened with her when she was trying to get an anicca seed from various people, because she was going house to house to house to house. How many houses did she have to go to to figure out that all of humanity is in the same boat, that we lose our loved ones, we lose our children. You're going to lose that kid either to death or to adulthood, but one or the other, you're going to lose him. And so that's the way that we have to see things, is that all life is temporary. And that if we can't see that directly, then we need some sort of, let us say, a way of the pacing to go figure it out for ourselves, to go around all of these houses asking for that aniseed, to find out that everybody's got the same trouble, everybody's got the same problems. This back to you, JJ, on that. This is one of the points about recognizing that you have the skill is because you've been there, done that. You've had to put up with stuff. You had to go and talk to people, bringing your misery party to them, hoping that you'll join the misery party and being very happy in a miserable kind of way, that somebody is willing to join your misery party, that they'll give you the company that they need. And so this is not so much of a skill level, or let us say that it is a skill, but it's a skill that we probably already have, if we would exercise it. To know that we can handle getting into that pity party, because we've been there, we've done that, but this time we're doing it wisely. We're not actually in a heartfelt pity party. We're just kind of half into it, or kind of, you know, in a little white lie or false kind of way, we act like that we're in a pity party, just like the Buddha acted for those Brahmins like he was a Brahmin. And I know that that gives the modern people a whole problem or two because they say, look here in the sutras, look here in the scriptures. Buddha is actually acting like a Brahman. He's agreeing with everything that they said. But oh no, he was using that in a skillful manner so that he could pull them out of it. But we have to, let us say, get in the swamp first. But then we can stay in the swamp but not be the alligator, not turn into the alligator, that we can stay there in the swamp. And deal with the swamp directly. But that dealing with it is then the leading part of pulling them out of it, in a way, kind of talk to the— talk the alligators into helping them to drain their own swamp. So this is, this is a way in this I know her last name was Gotama, but, uh, Hasi or Gasi— does anybody know the name of this, uh, famous woman who carried a corpse around? I'm sure, Michael, you know it. You don't?

**Speaker D:** Um, not at the moment, no.

**Speaker B:** Uh, but you know the story that I'm telling?

**Speaker D:** Yes, yes, I had to cover her ears. She didn't like it. All right, but yeah, no, I do know the story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. So this is kind of the way, Robert, for us to deal with this stuff is to know that you have been miserable too, and on this opportunity you're going to be in that misery but not of that misery. You're going to be able to get into their swamp, but you're not going to become the alligator. You're going to stay out of that and be able to handle it so that you can actually help them drain their own swamp and pull the plug on that misery joyfully.

**Speaker D:** You know what I was thinking of, Dhammarato?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker D:** Do you know what I was just thinking of? Or can you hear me?

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, I don't quite understand what you're saying. My ears are not that good.

**Speaker D:** Oh, I was listening to a conversation you were having with Avery, an older conversation, and I think it was about painful thoughts or something, and you were talking about being alive basically, and appreciating the breath and being alive, and I was thinking that, and I was driving while listening to it, and I was thinking let's say I got distracted while listening to the conversation and like a deer ran in front of the car and I swerved and like a truck was coming towards me and I just barely narrowly missed being hit head-on by that truck. Well, the rest of that drive I would be so happy just to be alive, you know, just the fact. And so why can't we be in that state of mind all the time where we're so appreciative of the fact that we're alive? That our body is not dismembered, you know. But we have to— it seems that we have to be in a situation where we, you know, nearly escape death or just came out of the hospital or, you know, something traumatic happens to really have that state of mind. And then it passes so quickly.

**Speaker B:** You're right that in fact that truck in front of you and your ability to swerve and get out of its way actually was a reminder for you, "Wow, isn't it marvelous to be alive?" That in fact, knowing that we're going to die is the very best part of that, because if we lived forever, then there would be no appreciation for life at all. But when we recognize that we're going to die, That makes our life precious. Wow, I don't have much left, but I'm going to enjoy the heck out of it.

**Speaker E:** You have a near-life experience.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, near-life experience. That's a good one.

**Speaker E:** I think it's from a movie.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that actual having death stare us in the face is quite a wake-up call if we're wise. To wake up, to recognize that we've got very little left. But what we do have left is precious. And that's mostly what people are having a pity party about, is because they've lost something. And so the leading part then would be to allow them to see that they haven't lost it all. They've still got their life. Left, they've still got opportunities left, they've still got something marvelous that they haven't lost. And if we can get people to start to appreciate that, then we can actually get them out of their pity party, to recognize. And one of the, let us say, strange ways of doing that is when somebody like has lost a daughter, You can ask her, well, which would you rather be? Would you rather it that your daughter died and you stayed alive, or would it be that you would like for you to have died and she as a teenager have to put up with your death? And almost everyone will come around to, oh well, I kind of appreciate the way that it is because the way of me dying, I don't want to do that, and having my daughter grieve over me dying. And so we began to turn that around for them, and they can say, wait a minute, I kind of like it the way that it happened. I would rather it happened this way. And we can appreciate still being alive. Now, we couldn't go and approach the daughter with the same riddle because she's dead. And so she doesn't have a choice in this situation. But the mom who has lost her daughter She does have a choice. Is she going to appreciate that she's still alive and that her daughter is not grieving over her death? Because that will help people when we see how much we do have. So Michael is absolutely correct when he's pointing out that getting people to appreciate the fact that they're still alive kind of, let us say, trumps whatever misery they had, whatever problem that they had. If they lost their job, yeah, but that's kind of wonderful. I would appreciate losing my job because now I've gained freedom from that job. Or if the house burned down, then in fact, that's something that happened to me when I was working for IBM. My house burned down. And all of my childhood treasures— my grandma's piano, the new tuba that I had purchased, a string bass that still needed work, tape recorders, electronic equipment, all kinds of stuff, including that bottom freezer kind of refrigerator that was so strange. And we lost it all. But guess what? With the insurance money I was able to quit IBM and go to university and get a degree in computer science, which is what I was wanting anyway. And so that house burning, it was, wow, what a cleansing operation that was. But it took me for a while to get out of my pity and get into hot dog. Now this is an opportunity. So this is a way that you can present it with people, if you know what's going on with them, is to help them after you pace them, is to lead them into recognizing whatever's happened is now a new opportunity. This is an old Chinese proverb, I think, that a crisis is actually just another opportunity.

**Speaker D:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Exchange, right? Like, I dropped my favorite cup and it broke. Oh, poor me, I was so attached. I drank coffee out of that same mug for years and years. It was special. But guess what? No, that coffee cup could be replaced. Got a new opportunity to get a bigger cup.

**Speaker E:** That's what I was going to say. You have a new adventure of a beautiful cup you've never seen before.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker E:** It's new. You know, can I say something about medical tests and trials? You know, if you have to go to the hospital a lot and you have anxiety or trepidation over medical tests, there's a way to turn that around and open up and see the adventure and the fascination. If you really don't know, if it's a new test, if you're going to have a bronchoscopy or you're going to have angiogram, no matter how gruesome it might be imagined to be, you've never experienced it, it's brand new. And if it can be looked at that way, and I can tell, I can tell you it can be, it's the same thing. And it doesn't have to be resisted. There might be some pain, there might be some strange peculiar sensation, but it doesn't have to be Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Right, going into the hospital and somebody is full of trepidation and full of fear, you can point it out that, hey, if this surgery is successful, you're going to be really okay. And if the surgery kills you, then nothing matters and you're still okay.

**Speaker E:** Death is a problem for the living.

**Speaker B:** Yes, death is a problem for the living. The dead love it. So, this is a way of leading them out of it, and thanks for mentioning this, Michael, is yes, being alive is marvelous! And it's much better than these pity parties that all of our friends keep having. And so, there is a way to cheer them up, by pointing out all of the good things that they have in life. So Dhamma Das, do you have any comments about this? I just love hearing it and sounds wonderful. All right, good one. Eamon, how about you?

**Speaker G:** This all sounds good. What comes up for me is.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker G:** Difference, or maybe the sameness, between this approach towards misery versus anger. What I learned is, especially if I am the subject of anger, that anger grows and sort of trying to soothe it makes it grow even hotter. Trying to not resist it makes it grow even hotter, to the point that's so big that it's much bigger than my Sati. So is this similar? Is there a difference?

**Speaker B:** Well, in the case that you're talking about, it's kind of like that you're actually playing both sides of this situation. You're the one who is complaining, and you're also the one who is getting you out of it. The question is, which side are you going to remember to play? Are you going to play the misery guts? Are you going to play the pity party? Are you going to play the champion? Your choice. If you can remember to play the champion, then you can start telling yourself, all of the really good stuff in your life. This is in fact what now I'm talking about, is just the normal practice of Anapanasati, that we play the misregards, we have the unwholesome thoughts, we worry, we fritz, we doubt, and then we can remember that we've got a higher side. Let's play that role. Let's gladden the mind, let's take ourselves out of our pity party by talking ourselves into seeing how marvelous things already are. Things are great if we'd only see them that way and start talking to ourselves about it like that, that there is no pity party worth keeping, that you're going to get out of it anyway somehow or another. You're gonna let it get old? So why can't we let it get old right now? That unwholesome thought, that's just old stuff. Let's come and do something new. Let's gladden the mind. Let's change our attitude. Let's come out of being the victim and find the champion within. This is just regular old Anapanasati practice. This is the actual teaching of the Buddha right here, is to wake up and take a look at that pity party we're having and make a change. Come out of our pity party, come out of the victim into the champion. I can handle this, I'll get over this. There's nothing to it. And look at all the stuff that is really marvelous that I still have. I'm still alive. And so this whole point that we're talking about here is actually something that each individual one of us does on our own when we're in seclusion. And then when we get our stuff together, become our own therapist, get over our misery, then we go out into the world and ta-da, there we go, having to deal with everybody else's misery too. But we've now got the skill to do that. We've got the skill. We know what misery is. We just got ourselves out of it. We can get somebody else out of it too.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like, uh, we don't have to go into it like, oh no, I have to deal with everyone's misery. We can go in like Hot dog, I can handle that.

**Speaker B:** You know, hot dog, I can handle that. Yeah, I've been there, done that. I know what misery is. I did a good job of it. I made myself really miserable, and I made myself get out of it. That took skill. Now let's apply that skill.

**Speaker E:** We ought to get out of the Special Victims Unit.

**Speaker B:** Special Victims Unit, I hear that. No, I've been in it because every victim feels special. Everyone who is in a pity party, they think that their pity is so unique, it's so deep, that only they can have it. There's an old spiritual, by the way, from the South: nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my soul.

**Speaker E:** Nobody knows the trouble.

**Speaker B:** I've seen. Glory, hallelujah, hallelujah. Only me has this. I'm glad nobody else has this much sorrow. Only me got it. So, Robert, checking back in with you. Are you still here?

**Speaker C:** Uh, yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay, so what about today's talk? What's your favorite part?

**Speaker A:** I like the singing at the end.

**Speaker B:** The what?

**Speaker A:** Oh, the singing.

**Speaker B:** Oh, the singing. Yes, nobody knows my sorrow, but that song is sung not in a woeful way, it's sung in a happy way. I even changed the lyrics by ending the second verse as: Glory hallelujah, nobody knows my sorrow, I've got the very best, I am unique, and I can see that now. Nobody knows what suffering is. So when you run across pity people that having a pity party, Robert, you can best them. Oh, I felt worse than you do now. Well, let me tell you all of my sorrow. You'll forget about your sorrow when you hear all about mine. And so there's a lot of skills that we can apply to this rather than feeling like, oh no, I've got to go jump in that river because they jumped in. That maybe the way to do it is to take a boat. You get into the river, but you're not drowning, you're paddling. So does anybody have any last words on this? Anything left? Go ahead, DJ.

**Speaker C:** I was just gonna bring up Also, another thing in terms of appreciating life is, you know, you bring this up quite often, Dhammarato, and it's very helpful, which is if you don't appreciate breathing, stop for a little bit. I mean, that might be a good thing to tell someone just to shock them to wake up, like, hey, just hold your breath for a while.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if it's that bad, hold your breath until you feel better. Because they can't hold it long, they're not trained.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, really going to want to take that next one.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh, they really will want to take that next one. Just wait. Brett, you were about to say something.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. All right, anybody got any last things to say? Amen, you got something? Everything's all right. Okay, well, I'm really glad to see you guys here today. This is actually kind of a new crowd. We've had an old crowd and nobody in them showed up, but all you guys who haven't been here for a while come on. So I'm really glad to see you, and I hope to see you again, Brett. I hope to see you again, Michael. It's been a while since you were on, Michael, but I'm glad to see you.

**Speaker D:** Well, she was born 4 and a half months ago, so I've been a little busy. And my other— my son Everett is 2 and a half, and, uh, you know, school year started up again. I was— I was on summer, and so just, you know, busy.

**Speaker B:** I'm really glad to see you.

**Speaker D:** Glad to see you too.

**Speaker B:** And Robert— go ahead, go ahead, Michael.

**Speaker D:** I was just gonna say, like, um, I think holding Omalee is just making other thoughts come into my mind, but if you guys have ever seen the children's show Bluey, has anybody seen it? It's amazing. They actually have an episode where the story of the woman with the infant, I can't remember her name from the suttas right now, but they reenact that story in one of the episodes of Bluey, and they incorporate a lot of like Buddhism and mindfulness in it because you you know, in Australia they're really heavily influenced by Ajahn Brahm's massive Sangha. And then there's another show on Apple TV, a children's show called Stillwater. Have you guys heard of that?

**Speaker B:** It's about this like Zen— I know about Stillwater, Oklahoma.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, there's a panda, he's like a Zen master, and he mentors these three children. And it's a really great show. But today's conversation made me think of an episode I just watched where the kid didn't want to go out in the rain and It's all about, you know, perspective. Basically, he teaches the kid about perspective. And this is all connected. My brain's synthesizing a bunch of stuff. But today we took our school. It was the last day of the semester before the winter break, and we went to old folks' homes, retirement homes, to sing carols. And there was like levels of severity to the different rooms. And one of the rooms we went, you know, there was rooms where just people were old and they were there. And then there was like rooms where, uh, there was one, there was one room where like nobody in there could function. They could, they couldn't even really open their eyes. They were all in a lounge chair, like not what you call them, Lazy Boy chairs. And, um, you know, I mean, they could, they could barely move their bodies or open their eyes. And, um, you know, here we are, uh, in these bodies that function and and we could talk and think about Buddhist concepts. And, you know, I think I heard you say recently also, Dhammarato, count your blessings. You know, like, just look at everything that's working— your toes, your legs, your arms, your eyes, you know, your health. Like, everything that's working in your body ain't going to work forever. Eventually it's going to fall apart. And sometimes it's helpful just to remember that because sometimes we're trying so hard to be happy and we really shouldn't have to make any effort. It should just, you know, kind of just be self-evident in a way if you, you know, change your perspective a little bit. That's what I learned from Stillwater, at least.

**Speaker B:** Good. So Robert, are you still with us?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there you go. So I'm glad to see you still. I hope that I see you again soon. Glad to see you popping into the Sangha groups from time to time.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I always enjoy our conversations, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** I know, I do too. I hope to see you again soon, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Cool, see you soon.

**Speaker B:** So, thank you all, thank everybody.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Glad to see you guys.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato. We'll let you go now. I've got pity parties to deal with. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Thank you everyone, bye.

**Speaker C:** All right, thank you, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a group of Sangha friends, centers on **how to skillfully interact with others who are suffering while maintaining your own well-being and joy.**

The discussion was sparked by **Speaker A (Robert)**, who expressed a common concern: when you bring joy and positivity to social interactions, people often open up and share their deep pain. He worried about navigating this skillfully without making errors or endangering his own peace of mind.

The group offered several key insights and practical strategies, summarized below:

### Core Themes & Advice

1.  **Maintain Your Center & Don't "Pick Up" Their Suffering:** Multiple speakers emphasized that you can be present and compassionate without absorbing the other person's emotional state. As **DJ (Speaker C)** put it, you can listen and be there without having to "pick that up." This allows you to be a stable, peaceful presence.

2.  **Two Primary Skillful Methods:** **Dhammarato (Speaker B)** provided a detailed framework for engagement, drawing from both Buddhist suttas and psychology (Neuro-Linguistic Programming).
    *   **Pacing and Leading:** This is a gentle, two-step method.
        *   **Pacing:** First, establish rapport and validation. Meet the person where they are, acknowledge their pain ("Yes, that sounds really hard"), and find common ground. This is like the Buddha agreeing with Brahmins on their own terms to build connection.
        *   **Leading:** Once trust is established, you can gradually guide them toward a more wholesome perspective. This could be through gentle humor, pointing out things they still have to be grateful for, or reframing the situation as an opportunity. The story of **Kisa Gotami** (the woman who carried her dead child) was cited as a classic example—the Buddha paced her desperate hope, then led her to the universal truth of impermanence.
    *   **"Smothering with Joy":** For when your skill level is high and your joy is unshakeable, you can directly counter suffering with persistent positivity, humor, and gratitude. This can feel provocative, but if done with sincerity and without aggression, it can break the cycle of misery. The key is not to give a "teaspoon of sugar," but a "backhoe shovel full."

3.  **Confidence & Discernment Are Key:** To use these methods without getting pulled into the "swamp" of another's suffering, you need **confidence** in your own practice and **discernment** to know your limits. As DJ noted, if you're not ready, it may be wiser to remove yourself. Regular seclusion and meditation are essential to sharpen this skill and maintain your own well-being.

4.  **Shift Perspective to Appreciate Life:** A powerful tool for both yourself and others is to shift focus to the fundamental marvel of being alive. **Michael (Speaker D)** shared how a near-accident creates intense appreciation for life. The practice is to cultivate that gratitude without needing a crisis. Encouraging someone (or yourself) to appreciate what is still working—breath, health, consciousness—can "trump" self-focused misery.

5.  **You Are Your Own First Patient:** The entire discussion was framed as an extension of the core Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) practice. **Dhammarato** concluded that we first learn to skillfully navigate our *own* pity parties and unwholesome thoughts, becoming our own therapist. Once we have the skill to gladden our own mind and move from victim to champion, we can then confidently and joyfully help others do the same.

### Memorable Analogies & Quotes
*   **"Don't drown with them."** (Dhamma Das, referencing Ram Dass) – Have compassion, but don't get stuck in their suffering.
*   **"The Swamp and the Alligators"** (Dhammarato) – When trying to help (drain the swamp), be careful not to become part of the problem (an alligator). Remember your original intention.
*   **"A crisis is just another opportunity."** – Reframing loss or difficulty as a potential new beginning.
*   **"If you don't appreciate breathing, stop for a little bit."** (DJ) – A stark reminder to jolt oneself into gratitude for the basic gift of life.

In essence, the talk provided a practical guide to **engaged metta (loving-kindness)**. It's about bringing joy to the world not from a fragile, naive place, but from a resilient, skillful, and well-practiced heart that knows how to navigate suffering—both within and without—without losing its way.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Pacing and Leading" Metaphor (from Neuro-Linguistic Programming/NLP)**  
This is the central metaphor of the talk. It describes a two-step method for helping someone in emotional pain:
*   **Pacing:** First, you meet the person where they are. You empathize, validate their feelings, and create a sense of shared understanding (like mimicking the posture of a catatonic patient). This builds trust and opens the door.
*   **Leading:** Once you have rapport, you can gently guide them toward a more positive perspective or state of mind (like offering the catatonic patient a cigarette).

**2. The "Swamp and Alligators" Story/Metaphor**  
This is used to illustrate the danger of losing your own center when trying to help others.
*   **The Swamp:** Represents another person's painful, messy emotional state (their "pity party").
*   **The Alligators:** Represent the negative emotions and dynamics within that state.
*   **The Moral:** "When you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp." The warning is that if you enter someone's emotional swamp without skill and confidence, you risk becoming part of the problem ("a swamp creature") instead of helping to solve it.

**3. The Story of Kisā Gotamī (the Mustard Seed)**  
This is a direct reference to a famous Buddhist story (from the *Therīgāthā* or *Dhammapada Commentary*).
*   **The Pacing:** A woman (Kisā Gotamī) whose baby has died is in denial and asks the Buddha for medicine. He doesn't reject her; he gives her a task that meets her where she is: bring a mustard seed from a home that has never known death.
*   **The Leading:** By going door-to-door, she discovers the universal truth of death (*anicca*, impermanence). This experiential discovery—led to by the Buddha's skillful instruction—allows her to accept reality and let go of her corpse. The story perfectly exemplifies the pacing and leading method.

**4. The "Pity Party" Metaphor**  
Used repeatedly to describe a state of self-absorbed misery or complaint. The helper's job is to avoid joining the "pity party" unwisely, but instead to either skillfully enter and then lead the person out, or to "smother it with joy."

**5. The "Life Raft" Metaphor (from Ram Dass)**  
Introduced by Speaker F: "Suffering because other people are suffering does neither them or us any good... [it's like] putting on the life raft so we don't drown with them." This emphasizes compassionate detachment—being present without being overwhelmed.

**6. The "Empty Space of Peace" Metaphor**  
Introduced by Speaker D (Michael), recounting Ram Dass's approach to being with the dying. He learned to be like an "empty space of peace," allowing their pain to come into him and "filter back out as peace," rather than trying to cheer them up. This is presented as an alternative or complementary approach to pacing and leading.

**7. The "Near-Life Experience" Wordplay**  
A twist on "near-death experience" (Speaker E) to highlight how a brush with danger can suddenly make us appreciate simply being alive. This ties into the theme of shifting perspective from loss to gratitude.

**8. The "Victim vs. Champion" Metaphor**  
Used toward the end to describe the internal work of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). When we are caught in our own misery, we are playing the "victim." The practice is to remember and activate the "champion within"—the part of us that can gladden the mind and change our attitude.

**Summary:** The talk uses a blend of modern therapeutic metaphors (**Pacing/Leading, Swamp/Alligators, Pity Party**) and classic Buddhist stories (**Kisā Gotamī**) to address the core dilemma: how to spread joy and help others without being pulled into their suffering. The metaphors provide practical, vivid frameworks for navigating this social and spiritual challenge.
