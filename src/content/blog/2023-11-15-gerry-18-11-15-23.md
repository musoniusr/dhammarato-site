### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Listening to some Tibetan-influenced American who I have recorded is into banging consorts for the sake of enlightenment. And after reading some of this stuff that the Tibetans do, about the chakras and dantians specifically, the idea of the cinnabar field or whatever they call it at the point 4 fingers below the navel and 4 fingers in. Now, I do get that. I do get a lot of sensation there. And I found that if I If I breathe in, I take the Anapanasati long breaths and I breathe into that point. So this is the sort of belly breathing. It switches everything on, huge thrills, instant Piti, not much Sukkha, but it gets there because it is sort of, it's intense. And you've got the sort of sense of energy going up the spine, all the rest of this Kundalini stuff that they write about, which is all the New Age people are into and so on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, greed.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** It's a kind of a greed. A greed for thrills, a greed for excitement, a greed for experience.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I see. So I don't know whether this is a quick way into Piti and Sukkha, which I think it is, or just some sort of internal wank. You know, sort of— While you were.

**Speaker B:** Describing these words, you were touching this side of the nose.

**Speaker A:** Was I?

**Speaker B:** No, the other side.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that one.

**Speaker A:** Didn't notice it. Yeah, go on.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, I was wondering if you were touching the side of your nose, not because Santa Claus does it, but because that was an indication of the technique.

**Speaker A:** No, it was not an indication of the technique. The technique involves sitting, sitting with the hands in the lap, usually, usually in this sort of— not necessarily— no, interlinked seems to get too— you have to— the interlinked fingers become intrusive. Holding them one on top of the other seems to work better. It's difficult to get away from the sensation. I see that what's-his-face, Buddha Dasa, seemed to spend a lot of time with his hands interlinked. You see him like that in pictures. But that seems to be to take the mind too much to the hands. But this, I mean, what I'm really asking is, if I do this, if I use this as what I think is a quick way to get to Piti and Sukkha, am I doing it wrong? Because if you are learning to play.

**Speaker B:** A musical instrument— Asking the question, asking the question, am I doing it wrong?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is a slow way to Piti.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, it is. But then you see, if you're learning a musical instrument, which is a thing you talk about quite a lot, You've got to do the fingering right. I mean, right, you know, you can maybe— And.

**Speaker B:** Hand mudras. Sorry, in fact, the word mudra, have you heard of the word mudra?

**Speaker A:** I have indeed. I have indeed.

**Speaker B:** Yes, okay. So the word mu actually is the word for hand. And so mudras are positions of the hands, yeah, and that there's many different ways to do it, but none of them are wrong. But what the hand mudras are designed for is to get people to pay attention to their hands, which is part of the body. Okay, and it doesn't matter whether you have the hands interlaced or whether you've got them on top of each other, or whether you're doing this. Oh yeah, there's also one that is called Touch the Earth, where you've got your hand over your knee like that so that you can just touch the ground.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so those are mudras to help us stay in the present moment.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And we don't have to worry about getting the mudras right, because when we're worried about getting the mudras right, we're not in the present moment of the mudra itself. We're thinking about the mudras rather than experiencing them.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** And so be aware of your hands, the positions of your hands, the touch and the feel of the hands as an aid to being in touch with the body, feeling the body. Which is where you're going to be also experiencing Piti, Sukkha, would be in the body, a feeling of relaxation, a feeling of well-being, a feeling of tickling, tingling, shivers.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but you see, this is what concerns me about it. It's all this. I mean, I again, I've been recording, I'm typing up what I'm doing. Do I treat this as good or dangerous? I just put my mind in there and it is all welling up now as I type. It's taking my mind off the typing, but I can feel it going from there. This is the energy flow stuff all the way up into my head. And if I get them let them come, I get big thrills through the body.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I'm now getting them just— Do you like it?

**Speaker B:** Do you like it?

**Speaker A:** Yes and no, because it feels like a kind of possession, as though I'm giving my body over to some kind of force. I do not see it as an external force. I suppose that is what is worrying me, because, you know, sort of possession and all that kind of thing.

**Speaker B:** I don't know anything about possession.

**Speaker A:** Well, the Christians, they joke about it, you know.

**Speaker B:** Possession is 9/10 of the law, so they say. If you've got it in your hand and that other guy says it belongs to me, he's going to have trouble getting it from you because you've already got it.

**Speaker A:** Yep, that's right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the question is, are you being possessed Or are you possessing something?

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm possessing something to the extent— well, am I being possessed? If I let it go, if I let it run, it feels like I'm being possessed. If I damp it down, then I've got control of it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's something to play with, right? Okay, what I mean by playing with it— can you let it go and still own it, still possess it because you can control it, or does somehow you lose control of it because you let it go? So you can play with that. I'm not asking you to answer the question now or get confused or anything. I'm asking you to experiment?

**Speaker A:** I can play with it. I can play with it. I do play with it because obviously the allowing it to go, letting it rip, and then calming down produces a great and very pleasant sensation of Anicca, of happy calmness.

**Speaker B:** Then I don't see any questions about it, and yet you're confused and asking questions.

**Speaker A:** That's right, I'm confused and asking questions because, I mean, for instance, let me tell you a little story. Well, no.

**Speaker B:** Instead, here's the thing to do though, is that when you catch yourself Through mindfulness, being confused and asking questions, you can put those questions aside and say, "I don't know the answer to that, I don't need to know the answer to that, I'm okay without knowing the answer to that, let me just sit here and be happy.".

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Questioning and confusions and doubts are a hindrance. Of course, of course, of course. So catch that, just like I caught you doing it. You can catch yourself saying, I don't have to have any answers, I'm having too much fun to deal with answers, I'm having too much fun I don't have to deal with questions at all. That in fact, that's the major reason why Westerners do not get anywhere with Anapanasati, is because they spend their time trying to get it right, asking questions, doing it right, more important than enjoying themselves.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to ask you the other question, of course, that I've asked so many times before. The Anapanasati Sutta takes you on from there to calmness, looking at what's happening in the mind and the, yes, the contents of the mind and so on.

**Speaker B:** Gladdening the mind.

**Speaker A:** Gladdening the mind. Yes.

**Speaker B:** And then step 9 and then gladdening the mind.

**Speaker A:** Indeed. How you do the other stuff like sharpening the mind and so on. I have no idea what that, I don't know what that means.

**Speaker B:** Liberating the mind. And making the mind Samadhi mind, they call it concentrating, it's not concentration. Concentration has the quality of removing things that are not important, and Samatha has the quality of bringing everything together. A little point that I make about that is with an alarm clock, what makes the alarm clock tick? And the answer to that— oh, there's a spring. When the spring is wound up, the clock will tick. So we take the clock apart and take the spring out, because that's concentrating the clock right down to the essence of the spring. But the spring does not an alarm clock make. You take that spring out of the alarm clock, it don't tick anymore. Okay, so we need the whole show. This is what step 10 and 11 of Anapanasati— no, 11 and 12— is to bring everything together. The Samadhi mind, which means comfort, at.

**Speaker A:** Ease.

**Speaker B:** No doubts, no worries, no— there's safety, security, comfort, satisfaction, and success, and we bring those qualities together in the mind, and that is what liberates the mind. What does it liberate the mind from? The doubts, the curiosities, the questions, the confusion. You don't leave any room for that kind of stuff because that tears the mind apart and separates it. Rather than letting it be unified and whole. It's a very standard thing. I really congratulate you for the success that you get, but then you tear it apart because you keep asking questions about it.

**Speaker A:** I keep asking questions because, having learned in other fields that there is a right way to do things and a.

**Speaker B:** Wrong way to do things— Right, and asking questions in this way is the wrong way to do it. Trying to get it right, trying to understand it, is the way of keeping us from actually having the happy life. You try to get it right. That's our society. Our society has taught you well that you're supposed to do it right, and so long as you're trying to do it right, you'll never get it.

**Speaker A:** Once upon a time, incidentally, I saw a US Navy, obviously an engineering ship of some kind, attached. It was in the same harbor as a very large American aircraft carrier, and on the back of the bridge, the, what I call the tender. The bridge was for— well, towards the front of the ship, and there was a stern, aftercastle, whatever you want to call it. And there was a large area in the middle where obviously work was done, and presumably helicopters landed and one thing and another. On the back of the bridge, there was written in large letters, 'Do it right, do it safely, which always amused me. But that's what you have to do, you see, if you're maintaining your U.S. Navy helicopters and so on.

**Speaker B:** Right, but the U.S. Navy helicopter is part of the U.S. military, which is the U.S. war machine. They call it the Department of Defense, but we're not here defending anything. We're in fact not trying to get it right and make it right and make everybody in the world behave according to our right. So let's leave the Navy. Let's get out of the Navy. I was in the Navy, by the way.

**Speaker A:** I know.

**Speaker B:** I've got the one tattoo to prove it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you've said. Can I ask something? I was watching your I was watching after the event your latest US Sangha meeting, in which you were talking to the people there about breathing, Anapanasati, and you said to them in turn, are you taking long, deep breaths now? Now, given that the Given that the Anapanasati Sutta starts, well, after all the stuff about what people do, it starts with going into the forest, sitting on a pile of leaves, etc. Seclusion. Why are you telling people to take these deep breaths when they're obviously not in seclusion? They're in a meeting.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the answer to that is that it's okay to practice any place, any time. It's to get started. We need to be in seclusion, that that's where we start. We start with seclusion, that in fact you could say that half the practice is seclusion, and in that half is where we also make friends with ourselves, we nurture ourselves, etc. And then the second half is out in the world, where we're nurturing ourselves and the world, and we're paying attention to the world while we're paying attention to our breathing. Is that we incorporate, that we start with seclusion, and then we add in, because there's nobody that I know of— occasionally, very occasionally, will someone choose seclusion for the long haul. Especially in the beginning. But it's always a mix, in and out, in and out, in and out. So you go into seclusion to practice, so that when you come out of the seclusion, you practice.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know, you seem to get a lot of people going into it for the long haul, doing 3-year retreats in caves and things. If you If you listen to all the interviews.

**Speaker B:** I know, but all of that is the spectacular part. That's all the big news. You know that in the journalism schools, they have the phrase of, "If it bleeds, it leads." Okay, well, that bleeds over into, let us call it, the spiritual life, in the sense that people wanted to hear these spectacular stories. Mm-hmm. Okay. And there's a lot of jokes around them too. But the point is, is that let's not look for the spectacular. Let's not look for the super duper special. Let's start being satisfied with the reality. What's real right now? So we go to the hut, we go to the forest, we go to the foot of the tree or pile of straw or or leaves, and we sit down and we practice throwing those thoughts of confusion and doubts and worries and getting it right, and we throw those things out and we practice everything's okay. We nurture ourselves rather than being critical. In fact, if you think of it, critical, that's questioning, trying to get it right, a set of rules, a set of standards. And what we're doing is practicing that in a different way, almost upside down, in the sense of we're not trying to follow the rules, we're not trying to get it right, we're not trying to do anything. We're quitting all of that and just relaxing instead, coming into a state of no fear. I'm not afraid. There's nothing on the porch here that's dangerous. The only thing that's dangerous is me not getting it right.

**Speaker A:** Well, what could be dangerous though is what is in my own mind. If I'm, you know, if I am letting things happen, which are obviously strange. I mean, this is not the sort of, this sort of energy flow stuff, sensations of energy flowing within the body. It's strange.

**Speaker B:** It's okay, but it can be strange in the sense of unfamiliar, but can you still be in a state of, "It's okay, yeah, it's strange, but it's all right, never mind"? Well.

**Speaker A:** It'S okay, the equanimity, no, you want more of it. Well, you— it is, it is. The greed comes in there, you see, because you want it. You want it. You want the sensation. You want to feel it.

**Speaker B:** It's merely liking them and being satisfied with the way that they are. We want to make them better. We want to get it extra right.

**Speaker A:** You do.

**Speaker B:** Okay, indeed. Well, you do. I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so the invitation now is to pay attention that you're doing that, and because you're trying to get it right, you're actually not enjoying it the way that it actually is. So start paying attention to this is good enough, really, rather than paying attention to I've got to get it right and I've got questions and all of that stuff. Just let those questions set aside. I don't have to know everything. In order to be joyful, happy, satisfied, content. And then the success is not success in getting it right. The success is enjoying it and being satisfied. Mm-hmm. Wow, I can be satisfied. Yeah, I don't have to know everything. A good example, out of very, very many, is that when all of the astrophysicists had their little package together about the Big Bang and Einstein and all of that kind of stuff, they were kind of satisfied and content. Then they launched the James Webb, which is getting new data. And instead of being satisfied with the new data and satisfied that they don't quite understand what's going on, they're all in a great big flurry because they don't like being wrong. And their old ideas were wrong. Okay. But they can sit there and just enjoy. Nobody found something new and they don't understand it yet, but they can still be joyful. Now, that's in true. That's with college professors. The example that I would use sometimes is that the President of the University, or Provost, or Dean throws a party, and all of the professors in that school come into the same room. Now, there is a huge, in that group, a huge body of knowledge, and yet they'll probably start arguing with each other. Over something or another, because they cling to that knowledge. Now you walk into that room, and you've got all of these college professors, tenured elders, emeritus, and all of that kind of stuff. You don't have hardly any of the knowledge that they have in sum total, but you can still be happy. You don't have to know everything. That's one of the points that the Buddha made in the Sutra No. 12 in the Majjhima Nikaya called "The Lion's Roar," is that he can be happy and content and satisfied with any group of people in any audience, whether it's in the royal palace or where he is. He does not have to know. He can be in Parliament and he doesn't have to know all the laws. But he can still be the star of the show.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, well, they love it. They love it when you tap their knowledge and tell them to get them to tell you how clever they are.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's because knowing and getting it right is very important in our society. And that's why so many people are miserable, is because they don't think that they've got it right. And the way that we're practicing is that whatever we're doing right now is good enough. We don't have to make an improvement to that. We're going to take the right effort to stop wanting it to be better and take the right effort to let it be okay the way that it is.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay. Well, that's the hardest part of all, I think. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's why the Buddha— you've heard this statement before, that the teaching of the Buddha is subtle and it is profound.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, why is it that way? Is because it goes against the way that we were taught to think. You were taught to think just like on that ship, to get it right, do it safely. Mm-hmm. Yeah, to get it right, to do it correctly, to hop 2, 3, 4, get in line, follow the rules, follow the orders. If you want to be military, that's the life. But normally, no matter how high you go up into the military, you're not going to be a happy man. You're just going to be following orders, trying to get it right.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So in our world, we're not going to try to get it right. We're not trying to follow orders anymore. We're here just to relax and enjoy our lives.

**Speaker A:** That is so counterintuitive.

**Speaker B:** It is. Well, it actually, it is intuitive. And the way that you're taught was counterintuitive. That's why kids grow so slowly.

**Speaker A:** Hospital.

**Speaker B:** Go pick up your— go, go clean your room, pick up your toys, pick up your clothes, do what you're told to do, do your homework. And finally, we get it drilled into us that we got to follow the rules and do what we're told and get it right. And so it's counter— now, but not counterintuitive— it's counter everything that society has given you. That's what makes it subtle and found is because it really is intuitive that I don't have to do what I'm told to do, and I don't have to be afraid that I'm not doing what I was told to do. I can just enjoy my life. Don't have to get the Jhana right. If you try to get the Jhana right, you'll never get it, because trying to get it right is a hindrance to actually enjoying it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Another question arises.

**Speaker B:** Well, can you stop having those questions arise for a moment and just relax instead?

**Speaker A:** Well, technique. You're out in the world, you get triggered by things, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, if— can I see that I'm being triggered and then stop being triggered right then and there? Do I have the right effort to pull those triggers back into place before they fire the bullet?

**Speaker A:** Well, it seems to me that that what you're aiming for is rather to take the shells out of the chambers so that the trigger falls on an empty chamber and the gun doesn't go off.

**Speaker B:** That's another analogy, a good way to put it. But that is— You're not loaded.

**Speaker A:** But that's a long way down the line, not getting loaded.

**Speaker B:** No, it's not, it's right now. Take those velas out of the chamber, chamber right now.

**Speaker A:** The question was going to be, if you feel yourself triggered, is it a good technique to apply the other trigger? Use the triggers to trigger the happiness.

**Speaker B:** Yes, trigger by taking a deep breath. That's a good trigger.

**Speaker A:** So yes, yes, okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Um, to see that you're triggered, to look at the mechanism of how you go from being triggered into going off in the way that gun goes off. Mm-hmm. With fire and smoke and force and all that kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Lots of noise. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, lots of noise.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So when you're triggered, can you see that triggering and then stop?

**Speaker A:** Well, somewhere down the line, one day perhaps.

**Speaker B:** No, do it next time. This time, every time that it happens, don't look off into hoping for the future. Can you stop it right now?

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe the answer is maybe.

**Speaker B:** Never mind, start again and stop it again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, well, this, this, this is This is perhaps enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay, let's start.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps enough. Okay, I am— I really, well, I find this very difficult being recorded though. I mean, now a whole lot of people out there know what goes on in my head.

**Speaker B:** They're very jealous of you also.

**Speaker A:** I really don't I find this very difficult.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's because you have a thought of danger.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, I have a thought of danger.

**Speaker B:** Well, then have the thought of, never mind, I'm not in danger, nobody's going to know anything anyway. They're more caring about themselves than they are caring about you. So you can just relax and forget about it, there's nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure this is right, but there's a whole lot of your followers who now know that there's an old guy out there who has weird things happening in his mind, you know.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's not the interesting part. The interesting part that I'm hearing about you is that they're jealous because you're making progress. Well, maybe. And you're very valuable to them. You give them that oomph that, oh, if this Jerry can get it, So can I!

**Speaker A:** Yes! What if it is dangerous?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the whole point. In reality, it couldn't possibly be dangerous. But in reality, nobody knows where you live. They don't know your telephone number. They don't know your last name. They don't know anything. They can put you in real danger.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's, that's why I— yes, that's why I want to keep it that way, and I won't sign up to things. But, um, there we are.

**Speaker B:** The internet is dangerous. But I found that I'm quite safe, even though in fact the ones that would consider themselves big enemies of mine are other meditation teachers. But I don't see them as dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Do they see you as enemies or just— Idiot.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I'm not a danger, I'm just an idiot.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're just running some other sort of program that isn't that isn't— that they probably regard— they probably regard as you're not getting it right according to their— what their interpretation.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's— but let them worry about that, or if they would stop worrying about getting it right, they could enjoy themselves as much as I do. I'm having a ball here. Well, But you can see on any of the videos that the proof is in the putting. And what I'm putting out is joy, happiness. With all your questions, you can't make me feel bad or sad.

**Speaker A:** They're not intended to make you feel bad or sad. They're intended to make me feel better.

**Speaker B:** Okay, there you are. Let's feel better together. So you stop trying to get it right, really, and just enjoy that you've got it enough. Enough already. You've got enough information.

**Speaker A:** Yes, enough.

**Speaker B:** You don't need 300 gallons of gasoline when you've only got a 50-gallon tank.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's true. That's true. Yes.

**Speaker B:** So let's be satisfied with our little tank and be happy.

**Speaker A:** Well, so long as it's full, because.

**Speaker B:** The— well, it doesn't have to be full. It's just drivable so long as it's not empty. Half a tank is wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's a saying in aviation that the three worst things in aviation are altitude above you, a runway behind you, and the fuel you left in the bowser back at the last field, airfield. But there you are.

**Speaker B:** But the whole point is that from the very beginning with Apollo, the Wright brothers, the Malaysian Airlines that went down, and all of that kind of stuff, is that airplanes are dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, I fly without an airplane, because airplanes are dangerous.

**Speaker A:** You're managing all these cities then, and flying about the place.

**Speaker B:** Well, good enough. Flying by the seat of my pants, but not through the flying through the air, just sit and enjoy. Yeah, yeah, don't need a bunch of cities, towns, villages, metropolises, or any of that kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, they seem to be very keen on that sort of thing in the outer blogosphere, or whatever you call it.

**Speaker B:** Well, it happens when you're comfortable and satisfied, but when you want cities, towns, and villages, then you're not satisfied. When you want to get it right so that you can get the cities— and by the way, in the Pali it's called idyā, and the real power is the power to be happy. The power to be your own boss. The power to see your own falsehoods, which gives you also the power to see the falsehoods in others.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the real power, not flying through the air. That's the greatest of these, and not even have a trapeze.

**Speaker A:** Well, of course, the trouble with all these, all these things is that, you know, it's rather like they say that in Scotland, the sunshine, there's always sunshine on the next hill but one. And with these iddhi or siddhi or whatever you call it, strange powers that people have, it always seems to be a monk in the two monasteries away that's got them. You know, there's always a lot of reports of them. Nobody actually has ever seen doing them.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely correct. Let's stay with what we can do, what we can see, and stop listening to the stories about far-flung places and spectacular things. Let's stay real.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** And in fact, that's one of the big problems with the way that we treat our children, is by reading them fairy tales and stories of spectacular things. Teaching the girls that someday their prince will come, teaching the young boys, oh, you've got to be the hero. Oh yes, Tina Turner was right, we don't need another hero.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, do you still listen to Tina Turner?

**Speaker B:** No, I just remember the song, You Don't Need Another Hero.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know, I know.

**Speaker B:** And we don't, we don't need more heroes. We don't need more stories about monks in far-flung places doing stupid and far-flung and dangerous things in the name of enlightenment, because that's not enlightenment. Enlightenment is being happy with what you've got, being lightweight, being awake. So that you can see our defilements and our destructive behaviors and set them aside. That's what enlightenment is. There's two kinds of enlightenment. One is to see it, and the other one is to drop it. Dropping it means that now we're lightweight. Lighten up. Don't get heavy about getting it right. Let's not be the United States Navy or the English British Navy.

**Speaker A:** Ah, the British Navy would never write slogans on the back of its ships. Come on, it's your lot.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad I don't have slogans on my butt too, or tattoos much of any place.

**Speaker A:** That's a thought. Somebody with a tattoo on his butt saying, "Do it right." Well, that gives rise to all sorts of thoughts. Get it? Do it right, do it safely.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you cool off, cool down, don't worry about getting it right. And just starting to enjoy yourself. You've got it. You've got good enough. It's good enough already, because that feeling of good enough is what brings on that Piti and that Sukkha, is that this is nice right here, right now. This is good.

**Speaker A:** Well, it is, because it's, it's There is also, there is a sense of.

**Speaker B:** There'S a sense of accomplishment, a sense of having something.

**Speaker A:** No, the sense of getting it. And this may feel, this may be useful to people listening. It's a bit like fishing. There's a bit, the sort of.

**Speaker B:** It's.

**Speaker A:** A— if you quieten everything down and you just sit there and you know that you wait for the fish to come to the bait, let's put it that way, you're waiting, you just wait for it to— the sort of trigger feeling to arise. You, if you go looking for it, it's not going to work. But if you have to, you have to, you have to know, well, it's all metaphor. You have to talk about fishing and hook bait and hooks and all that.

**Speaker B:** You've heard me talk about the story of going into a room with a black cat. If you go looking for that black cat, that black cat's going to avoid you. If you sit down in the middle of the floor in the darkness and the cat will come to you.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so you sit down in the middle of the floor, metaphorically, and just enjoy your life and good things will come.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, that cat, that's cat psychology. The cat is more curious than you are.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's why let the curious things come to you rather than you being curious chasing them.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's actually, yeah, it's interesting. I had such an interaction with a cat recently. I went to visit a friend's and they had a cat. And the cat looked at me and it ran behind a sort of stool, pouf-pouf thing on the floor. And it kept looking up over at me. Well, I kept looking at the cat.

**Speaker B:** To see what you were going to do. The cat was curious. What are you going to do about it?

**Speaker A:** And eventually the cat came over to be petted, you know, the way they do.

**Speaker B:** If you sit down on the floor in the opposite direction where the cat is, not facing the cat, you just sit down on the other side, the cat will probably come around. Sit on your lap.

**Speaker A:** Probably, probably.

**Speaker B:** So if you keep looking at the cat, that's, um, um, that's what predators do. Yes, they stalk their prey. So don't look at the cat.

**Speaker A:** Cat doesn't like it.

**Speaker B:** Cat doesn't like it when you look at them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's another thing you can do. Think of, think of a cat.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go ahead and finish this up. I think that you've gotten the point. Again, again, to stop having— until the.

**Speaker A:** Next time.

**Speaker B:** It'S just to chill, just to cool off, just to sit. You've had— it's good enough. Yeah, let it be good enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, thanks for all of that.

**Speaker B:** Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for all of that.

**Speaker B:** I'm really glad to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's very nice of you. Yes, glad to see you again too. You are full of common sense, but that's what's so counterintuitive about it because this is effectively a religious practice or a pre-religious practice.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point of that. It's not common sense. It's noble, high-quality sense. Common sense is do it the way that you were told to do. High quality noble sense is, it's already gotten done. Whatever needed to be done has already been done. The job is done now.

**Speaker A:** Until the next time. Okay, thanks Dhammarato. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on a practitioner (Speaker A, likely "Jerry") describing and questioning intense energetic sensations (Piti, energy flow, Kundalini-like experiences) he accesses through a specific belly-breathing technique influenced by Tibetan and New Age practices. Dhammarato (Speaker B) guides the inquiry back to core principles of the Buddha's path.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1.  **The Danger of "Getting It Right" and Greed for Experience:** Speaker A is concerned whether his technique is a "quick way" to meditative joy (Piti/Sukkha) or a kind of "internal wank" — a greedy pursuit of thrilling sensations. Dhammarato immediately identifies this questioning and search for the "right" technique as a form of **greed** and a **hindrance**. The desire for special experiences and the anxiety over doing the practice correctly actually block the simple, satisfying happiness available now.

2.  **The Core Instruction: "It's Good Enough" / "Just Enjoy":** Dhammarato's repeated and central advice is to **stop trying to get it right, stop questioning, and simply enjoy the present experience as "good enough."** He contrasts this with societal conditioning (exemplified by the U.S. Navy motto "Do it right, do it safely") which teaches us to strive, follow rules, and seek improvement. The Dhamma path, he says, is "subtle and profound" because it reverses this: happiness comes from **relaxing into satisfaction with what is**, not from achieving a special state.

3.  **Working with Strange Sensations & Control:** When Speaker A describes feeling "possessed" by the energy flow, Dhammarato advises playful experimentation—neither suppressing nor blindly indulging the sensations, but observing the relationship between "letting go" and "control." The goal is to find a balanced, unafraid awareness where these experiences can arise without causing confusion or fear.

4.  **The Purpose of Practice: Liberation from Doubt, Not Special Powers:** Dhammarato redirects the conversation from energetic phenomena (which can be distracting) to the true goal of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing): **gladdening, steadying, and liberating the mind**. Liberation is freedom from the very doubts, questions, and confusions Speaker A is caught in. He dismisses fascination with "iddhi" (psychic powers) or spectacular retreats as distractions from the "real" work of being happy and light here and now.

5.  **Practice in the World:** Speaker A questions the appropriateness of deep breathing practice in a group setting (outside of seclusion). Dhammarato clarifies that while formal practice begins in seclusion, the aim is to **integrate that calm, joyful awareness into all of life**. The "trigger" of a deep breath can be used anytime to counteract being "triggered" by worldly events.

6.  **Metaphor of the Cat:** Dhammarato uses the metaphor of a black cat in a dark room. If you chase it (strive for special states, seek answers), it runs away. If you sit quietly and contentedly (practice satisfaction and ease), it comes to you. Similarly, meditative joy arises naturally when we stop striving and become content.

### **Conclusion:**

The talk is a classic example of Dhammarato's teaching style: a student brings up complex experiences and technical questions, and the teacher consistently points back to the **essential, radical simplicity of the path:** abandon the greed to have more or better experiences, drop the hindrance of doubt, and cultivate satisfaction and well-being in the present moment. The ultimate "technique" is to **stop seeing practice as a technique to be "gotten right" and start relating to it as a way to relax, enjoy, and lighten up.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Musical Instrument / Fingering:** Speaker A compares meditation technique to learning a musical instrument, where you must get the "fingering" right to play correctly.
2.  **Alarm Clock:** Speaker B uses an alarm clock to explain *samadhi* (unification of mind) vs. concentration. Taking the spring out (concentrating on one part) stops the clock from working; you need the whole assembled clock (a unified, comfortable mind) for it to function.
3.  **Possession & Law:** When discussing the feeling of "possession" from energy flows, Speaker B plays on the legal phrase "possession is nine-tenths of the law" to reframe the question: "Are you being possessed, or are you possessing something?"
4.  **Trigger & Gun:** The dynamic of being emotionally triggered is compared to a gun firing. The goal is to "take the shells out of the chambers" so the trigger hits an empty chamber, or to see the trigger mechanism and stop it before firing.
5.  **Gasoline Tank:** Speaker B suggests one doesn't need exhaustive knowledge, just like you don't need "300 gallons of gasoline when you've only got a 50-gallon tank." Being satisfied with a half-full tank is "wonderful."
6.  **Fishing:** Speaker A describes the meditative state as like fishing: you quiet down and wait for the fish (a pleasant sensation) to come to the bait. If you actively go looking for it, it won't work.
7.  **Black Cat in a Dark Room:** Speaker B offers this metaphor for allowing meditation experiences to arise: if you chase the cat (seek experiences), it will avoid you. If you sit quietly in the dark, it will come to you.
8.  **Airplanes are Dangerous:** Used to contrast with the safety of the meditative path—"I fly without an airplane, because airplanes are dangerous."
9.  **Sunshine on the Next Hill:** Speaker A uses this saying to describe how special powers (*iddhi*) are always attributed to someone else, somewhere far away, never personally witnessed.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **U.S. Navy Ship Slogan:** Speaker A recalls seeing a U.S. Navy engineering ship with the slogan "Do it right, do it safely" on its bridge. This embodies the societal conditioning of striving for correctness that the dialogue argues against.
2.  **James Webb Space Telescope:** Speaker B tells the story of astrophysicists who, upon receiving new data from the telescope that contradicted their old theories, became upset because they "don't like being wrong." This illustrates the hindrance of clinging to views and knowledge instead of finding joy in the unknown.
3.  **Party of College Professors:** Speaker B paints a scene of a university party filled with knowledgeable professors who argue because they cling to their knowledge. He contrasts this with a person who has little of that knowledge but can still be happy, demonstrating that happiness doesn't depend on knowing everything.
4.  **The Buddha's "Lion's Roar" (MN 12):** Speaker B references this sutta, where the Buddha states he can be happy and confident in any assembly without needing to know all their affairs, illustrating the power of contentment over knowledge.
5.  **Childhood Conditioning:** A running story throughout the talk is the narrative of how society conditions us from childhood: "pick up your toys," "do your homework," "follow the rules." This is the "common sense" that the "noble sense" of the Dhamma works against.
6.  **Tina Turner's Song:** Speaker B briefly references the song "We Don't Need Another Hero" to underscore the point that we don't need to seek heroic, spectacular spiritual achievements.
7.  **Interaction with a Curious Cat:** Speaker A shares a recent personal story of interacting with a friend's cat, which hid and then approached when he stopped staring. This real-life example reinforces the "black cat" metaphor—experiences come when you stop chasing them.

### **Overall Thematic Purpose**
The metaphors and stories consistently serve to contrast two approaches:
*   **The "Worldly" Way:** Characterized by striving, getting it right, following rules, seeking spectacular experiences, and clinging to knowledge (Navy slogan, musical instrument, professors, astrophysicists).
*   **The "Dhamma" Way:** Characterized by relaxation, acceptance, finding satisfaction in "good enough," allowing experiences to arise naturally, and prioritizing present-moment joy over correctness (alarm clock as a whole, fishing, the black cat, half-full gas tank).

The dialogue uses these vivid comparisons to make the counterintuitive Dhamma approach more relatable and understandable.
