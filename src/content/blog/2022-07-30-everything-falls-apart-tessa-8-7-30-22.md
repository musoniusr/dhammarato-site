### Transcript


**Speaker A:** In a way of speaking, Tessa, the whole society of Western society that humans have built for themselves over the past thousands of years is built upon complaints. We are a complaining society. Even Walmart, the biggest room other than the main floor. The biggest room at Walmart is their complaint department.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, because it's Walmart, so— right.

**Speaker A:** But if it were really Walmart, they wouldn't bother having a complaint department. I think in fact what they got was, uh, the reason that they became so, um, uh, big was because they were willing to handle complaints. You see, in Asia, when you buy something, you bought it. You have to decide in advance whether you want to buy it or not, because if you buy it, you bought it. And Western people don't like that so much. The Asians are fine with it, but Westerners like to complain. And you really, really like to complain.

**Speaker B:** I complain a lot in my head too, mostly about myself.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, you really like to complain, and since you're the only one listening to the complaints, you're going to complain about you.

**Speaker B:** Makes sense. Yeah, like I complained today a lot that I should have started this practice earlier in my life.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, that's just another complaint.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And yet you come to me and complain that it doesn't work good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, sometimes it does and lots of times it doesn't.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and when it doesn't, you complain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** In fact, probably you were complaining about something else and then it doesn't work and now you're complaining about two things.

**Speaker B:** But I mean, I'm doing this so that it works. So yeah, of course I'm upset when it doesn't work because it means I'm bad at it.

**Speaker A:** Why are you upset when it doesn't work?

**Speaker B:** Because it means I'm a failure at one more thing.

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. It means that you're a human. Who told you you were a failure?

**Speaker B:** Because gladden the mind is supposed to make the mind gladder, and when it doesn't work, it means I failed again. Something else.

**Speaker A:** Oh, but you sound like the piano student has taken one lesson and complaining because they can't play Tchaikovsky.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was me too. Yeah, do the practice.

**Speaker A:** Then you complain about the practicing. You don't like to practice, and you don't like the fact that you don't get results with the lack of practice. So you're right.

**Speaker B:** No, but I don't— I I don't get consistent results. So yeah, the practice, just very haphazard.

**Speaker A:** So can you learn to be satisfied with not getting any results?

**Speaker B:** No, then why am I doing the practice?

**Speaker A:** Because you're learning to be satisfied, and you can learn to be satisfied even when you're not getting any results.

**Speaker B:** So learn to be satisfied without the results of being gladdened.

**Speaker A:** They continue to do it anyway. Oh, another example of that is the child sitting in the back seat of the car on a long trip saying, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet, Mommy? I'm bored. Are we there yet? And the child could be having a ball in the back seat of the car, but she decides to playing instead, always wanting results.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I want results because that's what the practice is called.

**Speaker A:** Well, no, the result— the practice doesn't lead to results, it leads to lack of results. You've been seeking results your whole life. That's one of the biggest problems with Westerners is that they're actually looking for results. Their whole life they've been taught that, and when they come to the Dharma, they want more results.

**Speaker B:** I thought the practice of gladdening the mind was supposed to gladden the mind.

**Speaker A:** Actually, it does until you stop doing it and start complaining.

**Speaker B:** But it doesn't. My mind does not always feel gladdened by the gladdening the mind.

**Speaker A:** Well, you just used the word it doesn't always. So now you're looking for results again rather than practice.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, because the results are— if.

**Speaker A:** You practice, you expect to fail. Imagine the kids out there learning to catch ball. How many of them does he miss? But when he gets one, he congratulates, and the daddy will congratulate him. Wow, that was a good catch!

**Speaker B:** Um, but then that means I'm terrible at the practice because I can't do it right.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can do it right. We've proven that you can do it right, and then there are failures in between, and you're not satisfied with the practice. You want immediate, permanent, fixed results. Yeah, yeah, you're result-oriented.

**Speaker B:** I am.

**Speaker A:** Rather than process-oriented.

**Speaker B:** It's true. Oh yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Instead of just enjoying the process and stop looking for results. Okay, in fact, the entire teaching of the Buddha is referred to as via negative, via negata. All right, what that means is that you're not going to get anything out of the correct practice. You're not going to get anything out of the correct practice. What you're going to do instead is lose. You're going to lose a lot of stuff. So we don't gain, we lose. Losing the agitation of the mind, losing dissatisfaction. Then in fact, satisfaction is kind of a non-doing. Dissatisfaction is a call to action. Because you want results. And the easy way to do it is to just stop wanting anything, stop wanting results. Just sit down and say, oh, I don't need it. I don't need results from meditation. I can just sit here and enjoy my moment. Now that's gladdening the mind right there. I don't need any results. I can just be satisfied with nothing. Or another way of saying it is, is that you're not going to get what you want. That is number 2 in the Four Noble Paths. The Second Noble Truth is wanting things that we don't have. And the average meditator, when they start, they're wanting things from meditation that they don't have. And so they're going in the backwards direction. They're not practicing correctly. Because they want something from their meditation. And what we're actually going to be practicing is catching all of those wants and all of those desires and say, ah, I see that I want something, I want results, and I can be happy without them. So we learned to first notice that you keep wanting things and wanting things and wanting things. And so the gladdening of the mind is to catch that and just say, okay, I didn't get it and I'm still alive, I'm still okay. That in fact, a really interesting way of looking at it is being satisfied, learning to be satisfied with not getting what you want, because you're not going to get it anyway. And satisfaction is probably not going to come when you do get what you want, because you're already in habit of just wanting and wanting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, then I'm on to the next thing. It's true.

**Speaker A:** So begin to see how much you want. You want result. Yeah, you want it to be permanent. You want it to last. And, and we've been talking about the fact that everything is temporary, everything is in cycles, everything is up and everything is down, back and forth, left and right. Just enjoy the ride rather than expecting it to go up and then continue to go up. You'd like it going up and you want it to go up. It's not going to go up all the time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know how to do that. I don't— good things have to be permanent and bad things have to go away right now permanently.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's, that's the attitude of a very unhappy girl.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, true. I'm not happy.

**Speaker A:** And when things come and go and you don't care because you don't— you're no longer focused in trying to get the stuff that you want, because that's the worst habit of all, is wanting and wanting and wanting and wanting. And even though you keep getting, you keep wanting more and keep getting more and keep wanting more.

**Speaker B:** I don't know how to stop doing that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you do. Yes, you do, by watching it, catching it. Seeing it and stop wanting. Say, I'm okay right now. I don't have to want results right now. I can be satisfied right now.

**Speaker B:** That feels like lying to myself because I don't feel that's true.

**Speaker A:** Continue to lie to yourself. Continue to tell yourself this new thing that you thought was a lie, and you think it's a lie because you have been actually lying to yourself all along. What are the lies that you're telling yourself? Oh, I can't be happy until I get my wife. What are the lies you've been telling yourself? Oh, you're a failure. If you complain enough, you'll get what you want. These are the lies you've been told, and you've been told a number of lies. And so when you start hearing the truth, you don't believe it because you've been believing so many of the lies you've been told. But if you look at the evidence instead of just feeling, oh, that's just another lie, if you actually look at the evidence You can see that you can do it. Okay, look at the reality of it. This is the investigation, is to recognize that you can change your mind. Remember, we did the red and then the green, so you know that you can change your mind from red to green. All you have to do is remember to change it from red to green. You're stuck in the habit of red, red, red. I don't get my way, I want this, and if I get that, I'll get green. No, green comes just by changing it from red to green. And you can change your mind. You know you can change your mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** In fact, that feeling like I'm lying to myself is much more of a feeling of disappointment. Which is a very, very ordinary, common feeling that you have. You go around feeling disappointed a lot. So recognize that feeling of disappointment. And the reason that you're feeling disappointment is because you are not meeting up some rule or standard not getting what you want, being a failure. And the real issue is to stop wanting things that give you the feelings of feeling like a failure, feeling like you've been lied to, and say, oh, I don't have to think about any of that stuff, I can just sit here and enjoy the moment. And then those thoughts will start up again, and you can say, aha, I caught you. What's happening is, is that you're starting in correct practice, getting some results, and then you revert back to the old, and then you get stuck in it again. And the main teaching of Goenka, the number one best teaching that he gives, is his little phrase of, when the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. Just come back and start again.

**Speaker B:** My mind wanders so much.

**Speaker A:** Thanks. Yes, so what? Yeah, so what? Everybody's mind wanders. So what? We've already established that your mind wanders. See that it wanders and be okay that it wanders.

**Speaker B:** I'm not okay with it. It should stay put.

**Speaker A:** I know you're the out— you're the, you're the school mom that's out there beating all the kids the whole time. And she beats the kids because they're not learning anything, but they're too busy being beaten to learn anything. The teacher's too busy beating the kids to teach them anything.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, that does describe my— yeah, that sounds about right. Well, why won't they all stop then? They should just stop because that's really—.

**Speaker A:** No, who is the one who just said they should stop? Is that the teacher beating on it again?

**Speaker B:** Okay, right.

**Speaker A:** Catch those kind of thoughts, recognizing that you complain and you want things to be different and you want results. Yeah, and that feeling is the problem, not the getting— not getting the results, because nobody ever gets any results. There are no results. Oh, okay. Let us put it this way. Well, listen to it like this. Way back when, in the 1600s, they paid about $24 in wampum for Manhattan Island. Then they moved into Manhattan Island and started cutting down the trees, and they found that it was a bedrock that was very solid, and started building buildings, and they built more buildings, and they built more. The results that they had was not good enough, and they went more and more and more results. Okay, and so they kept improving, kept building. Right. Would you say now, finally, after 300 years of millions of people nonstop working, trying to improve New York, did they ever get it? I mean, is New York City good enough yet?

**Speaker B:** No, no, it's not.

**Speaker A:** Will New York City ever be good enough?

**Speaker B:** No, they'll keep doing it.

**Speaker A:** No, things are not ever going to be good enough. But you've gotten the misconception based upon a very, very young childhood point, is that once you put something down, it should stay there. Yeah, once you clean the plate, it should stay clean. No, air is dirty, air is dusty. It's going to settle on the plate, it's not going to stay clean. You, you can wash your dishes and set them in the drainer and walk away, and then 2 years later you can walk back to that drain and those dishes are dirty. They're not going to stay clean. That's the reality of the situation. They built freeways in the 1950s in the United States, and people got the idea, oh, we've got freeways now. Guess what? They didn't maintain them. It was too expensive. They thought they built the freeways, and there the freeways are. They're good enough, they're going to last. They didn't. Freeway systems falling apart. Why? Because they thought that it would last, and it doesn't. It needs to be constantly repaired. The question is, can you happily do the repairs, or are you going to complain when you're doing the repairs because the road should have never needed to be fixed?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it doesn't matter what you do, the results of your actions are never going to be good enough if you set the standards high enough. But everything's going to be okay if you lower the standards. And your standards are way too high. I'm glad I don't have to live by your high standards. You make yourself miserable with your high standards, like permanency, and, oh, I got it one time, I should be able to keep it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the Buddhist teaching is that, no, everything is changing, everything is up and down. If you really take a look, you can see that there's cycles in there and things keep going around and around and around and around. Here's another example. An elevator. You want to go to the top floor. Well, after you get to the top floor, why don't you push another button and go even higher into the air than that? Why does the elevator have to stop? And the only way that it can use the elevator now, it goes back down. So an elevator is in a cycle. Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. That's all it can do. It can't go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, and keep going up. It doesn't do those things. And yet that's the mentality that you have, is that once I learn how to play that piece of music, I should be able to play it forever, even though I haven't been around a piano for a while. That in fact, I used to be able to play a whole bunch of stuff. Basically what it was is that the only thing that I had to remember was what was the first note or the first chord, and after that it goes. An example of that was that I played Moonlight Sonata, especially the first movement, over and over and over and over again. Now I don't even— I could walk up to people, I don't even know where to start. I've completely lost it. I remembered it, I memorized it, I knew it, and now I don't. The human mind is like that. But all storage devices are like that. That in fact, one of the major issues of the entire electronic and computer industry is how to store data. Why? Why is that such an issue? It's because the storage mediums are all temporary. Nothing lasts. Vinyl discs don't last. You play a record and the second time you play it is not as good as the first. You play it 100 times and everybody can hear the scratches in it. Everything rots, everything falls apart, everything has to be removed. Here's another point about— let's talk about the elevator. Up, down, up, down, up, down. Guess what? Sometimes the elevator doesn't go up and down. One of them is at night, there's nobody there pushing buttons, and so the elevator doesn't go up and down. There's another point, and that is, suppose the motor burns out, and now the elevator is not going to go up and down and up and down. Do you think the people in the building, some of them are going to say, oh, poor me, the elevator is broken, I can't do my job, it's too high to walk? But the elevator repairman he says, let me edit. I can fix that elevator, I can replace that motor. And then, then the elevator go up and down and up and down and up and down again. But it's only going to go up and down. The elevator repairman can't fix that elevator because it goes up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and keeps going up. It has to stop and then come back down. Okay, okay. So this is the whole way that we have to begin to change is that things are in cycles and the cycle that you get caugh in is wanting something and then becoming disappointed and then starting to complain. And you need to see that and say, ah, never mind, I don't have to complain.

**Speaker B:** But I do want what I want, right?

**Speaker A:** That way— and you're not going to get it.

**Speaker B:** That's going to make me really sad.

**Speaker A:** Well, get over your sadness. You can be happy instead, because that's actually quite a relief. Oh, you're not going to get what you want anyway. Why should you bother working so hard and only wind up in disappointment and complaining? Okay, if you can figure out that it's broken, then you can just be comfortable and happy with it being broken.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Then after you're satisfied that it's broken, maybe now you can take a really good close look at it, inspect it wisely, and either throw it out or figure out what to do with it. That in fact, I've done that with laptops in the sense of letting them sit for months Broken, dead meat, no power, whatever, like that. And then I'll come back and play with it like a toy, fiddle with it a bit, get it going. I did that just last night with a hard drive. I found out that the hard drive— Windows says I can't get it. I don't know it. It would check, uh, check this. Really what had happened was is that the security had gotten bad on it. But it took me about 30 minutes to find out what the problem was. But I wasn't feeling bad, I was really curious because I knew the hard drive was good. You know how I know it was good? Because I put it to my ear when it was starting up and I could hear that it was going through all of the right motions, all the right tools. So I know the drive was good, just Windows couldn't see it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** So it's just good.

**Speaker B:** Might be really bad one.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm talking about something that's actually quite simple, but it needed to be investigated. But you just said, oh well, I couldn't do that because my brain's not good enough. And here you go complaining again. Yeah, rather than seeing it as a toy to play with. Your brain actually is a toy for you that you can play with. Begin to investigate it, begin to look at it.

**Speaker B:** I've been investigating it.

**Speaker A:** It just doesn't— just not— well, all you found so far is the complaining layer. Can you peel back that layer and continue to investigate? And the way that you do that is by nourishing your mind, by nourishing yourself. By telling yourself everything is okay, because it is. You're still alive. If things were as bad as you think they are, you'd been dead years ago.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so all you have to do is recognize these complaining— complain, complain, complain, complain— when all you have to do is just stop doing that. And take a deep breath and says, right now I don't have to complain. Right now I'm not going to get what I want, but I don't have to complain about it. I can just accept it and be satisfied that I don't get what I want.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And then maybe you can use your wisdom to figure out something that you do want that you can have. There is a good substitute, like an easy moment, a deep breath. When the mind wanders away, never mind, just start again. It's going to continue that habit of complaining. You're very, very good at complaining. And so now that you've been so good at complaining, when you begin to see the mind, all you're doing is complaining. Now you need to see the complaining too. Now the complaining is actually the result of several things that happened before that. The complaining is what you do with the mouth and the thought process after you don't get what you want. And so the recognition that you didn't get what you want, and then before that was the wanting it, and you didn't see any of that. You didn't see the wanting, and then you didn't see the not getting it, and then you complained about it and you didn't see the complaining. So you can begin— huh?

**Speaker B:** I see the complaining.

**Speaker A:** You do now. I've been talking about it for weeks. Okay, so now that you're seeing the complaining, you can say, oh well, I don't have to complain right now. I can just relax because I'm not going to get what I want whether I complain or not. Complaining is not going to get you what you want. Okay, and you want things permanently, so for sure you're not going to get what you want because there ain't nothing permanent. Yeah, not even my English language. I have to go back into Euphonics. Okay, so you're not going to get what you want, but you can be satisfied that you don't get what you want. You don't have to go down that rat hole. In fact, what I'm talking about here, the Buddha laid out very, very specifically in the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, or dependent origination, that we have these thoughts. And those thoughts then can be very, very quick, and they give us then the feeling. And your feeling is the feeling of disappointment because you didn't get what you wanted. And then because you feel disappointed, now you start to cling. I've got to have it. You want it. So this is going then from the Saliyatana to the Vedana, from the Vedana to the Tanha. That's the wanting it. You want things that you don't have. And now the complaining is the Upadana. I gotta have it. I'm complaining. Okay, but that complaining mentality just takes you right into feelings of dissatisfaction. So you can catch that complaining and recognize, oh well, I'm okay. I don't have to be so critical that my criticism winds up being complaints, that I can change that into, it's okay, I don't get what I want, I'm not going to get what I want, let me become satisfied. And after you become satisfied, then you can begin to inspect what you do want and recognize that you probably didn't want that after all. I don't think you really want things to be all that permanent, that you don't want your life to be a photograph. You want it to be a movie moving from one frame to the next to the next to the next. And yet you're trying to make your life into a photograph. Have been all along. Yeah, you want it to be fixed, you want it to be right. Things are not like that. Things are much more of a movie, they're not a photo. In fact, only a photo can be perfect, but because it can't change. But life itself is a movie. And things are up and down and back and forth and all over that shop. And so when you want things to be fixed, they're not going to stay fixed. That's the reality of it. And when we can see that, then we say, oh well, I didn't really want it to be a photograph after all. I really do like it being a movie. Let me just sit and watch the show.

**Speaker B:** But my movie's like halfway done now and nothing cool has happened in a long time.

**Speaker A:** Well, now you're trying to make it a photograph again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, wait, how?

**Speaker A:** Fine. So what about the first half of the movie? Let's sit down and watch the second half of the movie. By saying it the way that you said it, it says, well, the first half of the movie was no good, so the second half of the movie is going to be no good because it's just a movie, it's just a photo. They're in fact— every frame is different. Every frame is a new frame. Every moment is a new moment. Wakey wakey! Wake up to what's happening instead of complaining that it's not the way that it should have been. It can be just the way that it is, and that you're satisfied with that.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So we take a deep breath and say, yeah, it's okay right now. All I have to do is stop wanting things, and then I'm satisfied, and I'm not going to get what I want anyway, so why don't I just be satisfied? So let's practice doing that right now. Let's practice that. Take a deep breath and say, this breath's good enough, this one's all right.

**Speaker B:** This one's all right, it's good enough.

**Speaker A:** All right, so take another one, and that breath's okay too.

**Speaker B:** That breath's okay too. It's not, it's really not satisfactory.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. If you— you'd be dead if you didn't take that breath.

**Speaker B:** It's really boring.

**Speaker A:** Well, no, you want it to be different than it is. That's what boredom is. That's what restlessness is. You're not satisfied with the moment. So now take a breath that is satisfied, that is good enough just as it is. This breath is keeping you alive. Let it do its work and be grateful that breathing works. So you take another breath. Everything is all right. I'm still breathing.

**Speaker B:** So boring.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you don't like it. You're in the habit of not liking it. Why don't you take a moment to start liking the breath?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Was this life-giving? Allow yourself to enjoy being just alive right now.

**Speaker B:** That's too low a standard just to breathe.

**Speaker A:** Well, lower your standards. You got to start all over again. Lower your standards down to being okay with just being alive, okay with just taking a breath. Back to the basics. Beginner's mind. Throw out the standards and just be comfortable and happy and secure that you can still breathe.

**Speaker B:** I can't throw out the standards, they just come right back.

**Speaker A:** You just dropped them or they wouldn't come back. You'd have killed them. So yes, we know they're coming back. Be on guard and throw it out and say, never mind those standards, I'm going to lower the standards again. Keep lowering the standards. Do you get satisfied with how low the standards are? Never mind where the standards are, lower them to the point that you can be satisfied with this present moment. That was a good one.

**Speaker B:** My mind does not feel gladdened.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because the thought that you had was, my mind is not gladdened. The thought that you can have is, never mind, take another breath. Never mind. You're always looking for the problem rather than looking for the fact that you've got no problem. If you lower your standards enough, then you've got no issues, you've got no problems. You're okay already the way that you are. Yes, those thoughts will come back. Never mind, start again. Everybody gets stuck at just step 1. This is step 1. But Bhikkhu is really big on it. This is step one. Every meditator does this. They put their mind on the breath and then it falls away again, and then they start jawboning with complaints the way that you do. Okay, so when are you going to recognize that and say never mind the complaining and just start again?

**Speaker B:** I guess I'm just very terrible at this practice.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not that you're terrible at the practice. That's just another standard that you met that you're not meeting. You keep putting your own roadblocks in the way instead of just taking another deep breath and enjoying it. Come on, let's do this. Let's take a deep breath. If you can, do breathing through your nose and watch the air as it comes in. Watch the chest as it expands. Get to know the body as it actually is right now. It's a functioning, normal human body. It's a nice home to stay in. It's a nice toy to play with. I see you going— yeah, why do you do that?

**Speaker B:** I'm breathing out.

**Speaker A:** Well, I said with the nose. Try it with your nostrils. Can you breathe with your nostrils? Are your nostrils clear?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're clear.

**Speaker A:** If they're not, then the thing to do is to use some antihistamine or something and get them cleared again. Remove the mucus from the sinuses so that you can breathe. And start watching the breath, start experiencing what the breathing does to the body. If you begin to breathe a lot, long in and long out, the body becomes energized. It becomes tingly alive, vibrantly alive. But you have to keep doing it, and you keep stopping to complain. So when you complain, recognize that, oh, I'm just complaining again. Never mind, start again and take another deep breath. Come on, let's do it. Come on, another deep breath. Kind of like the count of 4. Breathe in, 1, 2, 3, 4. Breathe out, 1, 2, 3, 4. Don't talk, just breathe. Don't listen to the mind, just breathe. Watch the breathing. Continue to breathing in and out and watch the breathing. You can't watch last year's breath. You can only watch the one you're having right now. Be in the present moment and breathe. There you go, that's a good point. That proves that you're looking at the, the body, you're looking at the nose. Excellent. Keep breathing. You're alive. Keep breathing. You're okay. There's no problems right now. All you have to do is keep breathing. No jobs to do, no work to do, no mind to clean out, no gladdening of the mind to do. Nothing to do. Just relax. And enjoy the breathing. Continue to breathe. Let's do it. Keep going. I don't know what you're looking at, but you don't have to look at anything. You can just breathe. Nothing to do. When the boredom comes, never mind the boredom. We're just going to watch the breathing instead.

**Speaker B:** But my mind can't focus on the breath.

**Speaker A:** You're talking about focusing the mind, and I'm talking about just Breathe. Continue to breathe. Never mind what the mind is doing, just come back and do the breathing. And just keep coming back to the breath and just keep Breathing, just watching the breath come in and out, noticing the rising.

**Speaker B:** Can't watch the breath, it's all over the place everywhere.

**Speaker A:** All right, you're seeing that. Never mind, I hear you complaining again. Yeah, you're just complaining. You're, you're non-stop complaining. Let's stop the complaining and just watch the breath again. You can watch the breath, and then you watch it for a while, and then you start complaining again. Catch that complaining. Notice that you start complaining, and then just never mind the complaints. Never mind the complaints. Never mind the complaining. Never mind the complaints. Just start again.

**Speaker B:** But the complaints just come back.

**Speaker A:** There you go again. There's the complaining again. You start complaining again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because the complaints keep coming back.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and when they do, never mind. Start again. See those complaints without bringing them out into verbal and me having to point out that you're complaining again. You can see that you're complaining yourself. You could bring the complaint— never mind, start again with the breathing. Never mind, start again. Never mind the complaining, just start again. Take another deep breath. Enjoy this breath, it's life-giving. Notice that as you're breathing in deeply, it cleans the lungs, it cleans the body, it cleans the blood, nourishes you. So keep taking the deep breaths and keep nourishing and nourishing. And when the complaints come in, never mind, start again, back into the nourishing. Start into back into the breathing. You can do it. You can say, I can do it. I can breathe. I can breathe.

**Speaker B:** I can breathe.

**Speaker A:** You can breathe.

**Speaker B:** My really boring breath that my mind can't focus on.

**Speaker A:** Ah, the really boring is the complaint again. Let's see those complaints and say, never mind, I can breathe. Period.

**Speaker B:** Never mind, I I can breathe.

**Speaker A:** You can breathe. So breathe, breathe deep. How deep can you breathe? Fill it up, get a big one. Let it out joyfully. Breathe in again, fill it up. Just breathe. Keep breathing, recognizing that it keeps you alive. Just one more breath. Just one more. Never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** It's really hard to do that when I'm upset.

**Speaker A:** It's very hard to do that when I'm upset is just more complaining. Why do you complain to me? Why don't you see those complaints in your own mind and say, oh, that's just complaining?

**Speaker B:** I do, but they don't stop. They just keep coming back.

**Speaker A:** Well, they don't stop. Like, you're the one who's creating that thought and you're complaining about it. Recognize that that's complaint and say, oh, I don't have to complain. You really don't have to keep complaining. You can in fact put a smile on yourself and say, right now I don't have to complain. You really don't have to complain right now. You can take a deep breath and just enjoy the breath. Let's see you take a deep breath, a really big one, long, slow. Deep breath.

**Speaker C:** Counting slowly: 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker A:** On an in-breath, that long.

**Speaker B:** I can't breathe that long.

**Speaker A:** Sure you can. Breathe slowly but long.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker A:** And fill up all together. Go stretch the lungs a little bit. See what a full breath really is.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4 on the in-breath. 1, 2, 3, 4 on the out-breath. 1, 2, 3, 4 on the in-breath. 1, 2, 3, 4 on the out-breath.

**Speaker A:** And keep going.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4 on the in-breath, and 1, 2, 3, 4 on the out-breath.

**Speaker A:** And when the complaints come, never mind, just start again. Come back to the breath.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker A:** This is a good breath.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker A:** I feel relaxed.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker A:** Success.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4, feeling good. 1, 2, 3, 4, relaxed.

**Speaker A:** Over and over and over again. And when the thoughts of complaints come up, Say never mind, start again. Let's come back to the breath.

**Speaker C:** 1, 2, 3, 4, and in-breath. 1, 2, 3, 4, and the out-breath.

**Speaker A:** Oh, this is a good one. Oh, I like this breath.

**Speaker B:** I don't. They're boring and my mind can't focus on them.

**Speaker A:** Well, let them be good. Tell yourself that it is a good breath. You are really, really stuck in complaining. You want to complain. You want someone else to fix you. Yeah, and no one is. Nobody's going to fix you. Oh, this is the way to do it, is to come out of your complaining mind and take another deep breath. Catch your mind when you complain and say, never mind, I don't have to complain right now. I'm not going to get what I want anyway. So just take another breath. At least be in the present moment, because you're not ever going to get all the stuff that you want.

**Speaker B:** I can't be in the present moment. My mind won't focus.

**Speaker A:** Well, say never mind those thoughts and start again. You're already telling yourself that you can't do it. And you won't come out of the complaining. You keep coming back to the complaint and then share the complaint with me. I don't want to hear you complaining. Nobody wants to hear you complain. You don't even want to hear your complaining, and yet you're stuck in non-stop complaining. You picked that up many, many years ago, and you've been complaining ever since. So see these complaints, see the thoughts of the complaints that nothing is ever good enough, and come to the point of at least admitting and recognizing that this breath is good enough. It's keeping you alive. That's all that's necessary. You're still alive. It's good enough.

**Speaker B:** That just reinforces for me that it is not.

**Speaker A:** Then you're stuck to live in the hell that you've created. Okay, I can't help you. Meditation can't help you. The Buddha can't help you. Jesus can't help you. The mummy in your mind cannot help you because you refuse to be helped. You absolutely refuse it. You are stuck in wanting to complain, and you don't even like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So why don't you do something that is nice for you, so good for you, to take a deep breath and just enjoy that this is a good breath and you don't have to complain about.

**Speaker B:** It. But the same thoughts keep happening.

**Speaker A:** I've heard that before. I mean, I know, I knew it, that as soon as you open your mouth, you're going to complain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because the thoughts are not changing. I try to change them, the same thoughts come back.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you don't want them to change, that I'm inviting you to change it.

**Speaker B:** I do want them to change, but.

**Speaker A:** The old thoughts just Well, then do it right now. Change it right now.

**Speaker B:** To what?

**Speaker A:** All right. Now I see you smile. Finally. Finally, I get a smile out of you. Finally, I get a smile out of you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** You can change. Change now. Put a smile back on. That's a false smile, and you know it.

**Speaker B:** I know. Well, yeah, you told me to lie to myself. That's what you said.

**Speaker A:** No, I didn't say to lie to yourself. You're the one who was saying that you were lying to yourself, and I agree that you have been lying to yourself. You've been telling yourself all kinds of lies, including that you said keep lying.

**Speaker B:** To yourself because this is— I said.

**Speaker A:** Keep saying those things because they're not lies. Keep saying those things that are wholesome, valuable to you, that you know are true, that you're saying are lies. You've misheard me.

**Speaker B:** That say it's good enough right now because it isn't.

**Speaker A:** Why don't you stop complaining right now?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** You'Re pleading with me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I mean, what do you want me to say? Just pretend.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a beautiful, wonderful breath this is. I'm really glad I can take a deep breath.

**Speaker B:** It's not.

**Speaker A:** Why not?

**Speaker B:** Because it's boring and my life sucks instead.

**Speaker A:** Well, those are just thoughts. Why do you have to have those thoughts when you can have the thought, oh, well, at least I'm still alive, I can at least take a next breath?

**Speaker B:** Because who cares about being alive if your life just sucks?

**Speaker A:** Well, you are alive. We've already discussed this. Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do it? What kind of— what— how would you do it?

**Speaker B:** I wouldn't.

**Speaker A:** Well, you've got to. You say that life is not worth living, it sucks too much, so why don't you just go ahead and quit?

**Speaker B:** Because I have a survival instinct. I can't overcome it.

**Speaker A:** Also, you're doomed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that sounds about right.

**Speaker A:** You're locked away in a prison of your own creation.

**Speaker B:** Well, I don't know if I created.

**Speaker A:** It, but it's— I can't— well, certainly you did. You learned how to from the parents, from your mommy, but you created that when you were a little girl. You created it ignorantly, but you created it. And you continue to do it, but you can change and not be the same you that created it.

**Speaker B:** How though? Because it's no matter what I do, it's still there.

**Speaker A:** It's not still there, it comes back. It's not still there, it comes back.

**Speaker B:** These things are on the site really fast all time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so you can catch it really fast every time, or once in a while, and say never mind and come back to the breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** It'S not there all the time. I've seen you smile. I've seen you smile real smiles of insight. I know you can do this, but you have to see the complaints and stop complaining and just enjoy the moment. The complaints always have to do with the past and the future. Oh, my whole life I haven't done this, and oh, I want it to be permanent into the future. And all we're actually talking about is what's happening right now. This breath is the only breath you've got. Okay, might as well enjoy it. Okay, so let's have a breath that you actually enjoy having.

**Speaker B:** I didn't enjoy any of those.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, here's this point then. Let's do it this way. I want you to stop breathing and hold your breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Stop breathing completely. Don't breathe. Whatever thoughts or complaints that you want to have, just go ahead and have them, but don't breathe. Make sure that your mouth is closed. Hold your nose. Make sure that you're not breathing. Continue to not breathe. And please continue to hold your breath. The body will want the breath, but you're not going to let it have it. Now you're beginning to want that breath, aren't you? Yeah, you begin to want. Okay, so go ahead and have the breath.

**Speaker B:** Hey, that was satisfying.

**Speaker A:** That was a good one. Finally you have a good breath.

**Speaker B:** That was satisfying.

**Speaker A:** All right, so now that you know that you can have a satisfying breath, and that may be the need, the way that you need to practice for a little while. If you can't have a satisfying breath, hold your breath. And don't breathe until you really want it, and then take it, and then it's going to be really satisfying. And guess what? While we've been doing this for the past 30 seconds or more, you haven't complained once.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** So that technique of holding your breath got your attention. Right, okay. So now that you know that you can enjoy the breath, that you need it— you need these breaths. Yeah, if you don't believe me, then hold your breath again to see.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And not only that, do you need to breathe, but when that first breath comes in, it's really enjoyable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so get in touch with the fact that your breathing is enjoyable. Let yourself enjoy being alive. Let yourself enjoy breathing instead of complaining about things not being good enough. Things are good enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the puppy unplugged, uh, something. Oh, causing the network to go down. Oh. So anyway, while we were out, did you, uh, did you stop breathing? Did you die? No, you continue to breathe. Yeah, all right.

**Speaker B:** I held my breath again.

**Speaker A:** All right, so work with the breath, play with the breath, get in touch with the breath, spend mind moments thinking about inspecting and looking at the breathing, and stop having the thoughts of complaining all the time. In that moment. Complain later, okay? But for 5 or 10 minutes, just watch the breath and enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Okay?

**Speaker A:** Knowing at the end of the time, 5 or 10 minutes later, you can go complain all you want, okay? But for right now, we're not going to complain about the breathing. We're not going to complain about what the mind does. We're just going to enjoy the breathing. Arahant. We'll go practice this. Practice enjoying your breath.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Instead of complaining about it, just enjoy it, because you're not going to get what you want anyway. But you're still alive. You do get the air.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** There was a— there was a, um, actually it was a musical, I think, by the name of The Best Things in Life Are Free. The very best things in life are free, especially the air you breathe. There's no meter on your mouth that you can breathe. Enjoy being alive. Yes, okay, enjoy being alive, taking a breath, letting it fill the lungs. Recognize that right now I feel alive. And I'll complain later.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, let's do this. Go practice. Okay, hold your breath until you want it and then really enjoy it. Okay, okay. All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on a dialogue with a practitioner (Speaker B) who is deeply stuck in a cycle of complaint and results-oriented striving, especially in their meditation practice.

Here is a summary of the core teachings and dynamics:

### **Core Problem: The Habit of Complaint & Craving Results**
*   **Complaint as a Default:** The talk begins by framing Western society—and the practitioner's mind—as built on complaint. The practitioner's internal dialogue is dominated by complaining about themselves, their practice, and their life.
*   **"Results-Oriented" vs. "Process-Oriented":** Dhammarato identifies the root issue: the practitioner is desperately seeking **permanent, immediate results** from meditation (e.g., a permanently gladdened mind). This craving for a specific outcome is itself the source of dissatisfaction.
*   **The Lie of Permanence:** The practitioner holds the unrealistic standard that good states should be permanent and bad states should vanish forever. Dhammarato explains that this is contrary to reality (*anicca*), where everything is cyclical and changing—like an elevator that goes up and down, not up forever.

### **The Radical Solution: Satisfaction Without Results**
Dhammarato presents a counterintuitive path to peace:
1.  **Stop Wanting Results from Practice:** The true practice is to **learn to be satisfied even when you don't get the results you want**. The Buddha's path is *via negativa*—a process of **losing** (agitation, dissatisfaction) rather than gaining.
2.  **Lower Your Standards:** The practitioner's standards for happiness are impossibly high. Peace is found by lowering the standard to something simple and always available: **"I am alive and breathing right now. That is good enough."**
3.  **Catch and Release Complaints:** The key skill is to notice the complaining thought (e.g., "This is boring," "I'm a failure," "My mind won't focus") and, without fighting it, say **"Never mind, start again."** This is the essential instruction from Goenka: gently return to the breath.
4.  **Breathe to Be Alive, Not to Achieve:** The meditation instruction is stripped back: don't focus to achieve bliss; just **breathe to enjoy being alive**. The breath is a life-giving gift, not a performance.

### **The Lively Dialogue & Key Metaphors**
The talk is a real-time demonstration of the practitioner's resistant mind and Dhammarato's skillful means:
*   **The Child in the Car:** The practitioner is like a child constantly asking "Are we there yet?" instead of enjoying the ride.
*   **The Piano Student:** Complaining after one lesson for not being able to play Tchaikovsky.
*   **The Harsh Schoolmom:** The practitioner is the teacher who beats the students (her own thoughts) for wandering, preventing any real learning.
*   **New York City & The Freeway:** Nothing is ever "finished" or permanently good enough; everything requires ongoing maintenance. Seeking a final, perfect state is futile.
*   **Photograph vs. Movie:** Life is a movie—changing, flowing, and cyclical. Suffering comes from trying to freeze it into a single, perfect photograph.
*   **Holding the Breath:** The most potent practical intervention. By having the practitioner hold her breath, Dhammarato lets her body **crave the breath**, making the next breath genuinely satisfying. This experientially proves that satisfaction comes from releasing want, not getting what you think you want.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a compassionate but firm intervention against the deep-seated habits of complaint, results-driven anxiety, and perfectionism. The path out is not to improve the complaints but to **see them as mere habits of mind**, let them be, and repeatedly return to the simple, life-sustaining present moment—symbolized by the breath. The ultimate instruction is to **"practice enjoying your breath"** instead of using it as a tool to get somewhere else.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and illustrative stories to challenge Speaker B's "result-oriented" and complaining mindset, guiding them toward a "process-oriented" approach to meditation and life.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### Core Guiding Metaphors
1.  **The Photograph vs. The Movie:** This is the central metaphor of the talk. Speaker B is criticized for wanting life to be a **perfect, static photograph**—fixed, permanent, and right. Speaker A argues life is actually a **movie**—constantly changing, with ups and downs, frames moving from one to the next. The path to satisfaction is to "sit and watch the show" rather than trying to freeze a single frame.

2.  **The Elevator:** Used to illustrate natural cycles and the impossibility of permanent ascent. An elevator only goes **up and down** in a cycle; it cannot go "up and up and up" forever. This mirrors the mind and life experiences (happiness/sadness, success/failure). The broken elevator motor represents temporary setbacks, but even when fixed, the fundamental cycle (up/down) remains.

3.  **The Child in the Back Seat:** The child incessantly asking **"Are we there yet?"** on a long trip represents the result-oriented mind that cannot enjoy the journey (the process). The child could be playing and having fun but chooses to focus only on the destination.

### Metaphors for the Mind & Practice
4.  **Learning to Catch a Ball:** A child learning to catch will **miss many times** before making a catch. The practice is about continuing, not about perfect, immediate results. The occasional successful catch is celebrated, but the misses are expected and part of the process.

5.  **The School Mom/Teacher Beating the Kids:** Speaker B is compared to a harsh teacher who **beats the students** for not learning, but the beating itself prevents any learning from happening. This metaphor criticizes Speaker B's self-criticism and high standards as counterproductive to growth.

6.  **The Rat Hole:** Complaining and wanting are described as going down a **"rat hole"**—a dark, repetitive, and pointless cycle that leads nowhere.

7.  **Red Light / Green Light:** A simple mental switch. The mind can be in "red" (complaining, dissatisfied) or "green" (satisfied, accepting). The practice is to remember you can consciously change it from red to green, regardless of circumstances.

8.  **Peeling Back Layers / The Complaining Layer:** The mind is likened to an onion or a system with layers. Speaker B has only found the superficial "complaining layer." The instruction is to "peel back that layer" through investigation and nourishment to see what's beneath.

9.  **The Mind as a Toy:** Speaker A suggests treating your own brain as a **toy to play with and investigate**, fostering curiosity rather than judgment.

### Stories and Analogies for Philosophical Points
10. **Walmart's Complaint Department:** Used humorously at the start to introduce the theme of Western society being built on complaints. The size of the complaint department is hyperbole to make the point.

11. **Buying in Asia vs. the West:** A cultural story to contrast finality (Asia: "you bought it, you bought it") with a culture of complaint and return (West), framing complaining as a learned cultural habit.

12. **The Piano Student After One Lesson:** The student who complains they cannot play Tchaikovsky after a single lesson exemplifies unrealistic expectations and impatience for results.

13. **Manhattan Island / New York City:** The centuries-long, ongoing development of New York City illustrates that nothing is ever "finally good enough." The pursuit of permanent, perfect results is endless and futile.

14. **Washing Dishes / Building Freeways:** These are analogies for **impermanence and necessary maintenance**. Clean dishes get dusty; freeways built in the 1950s are now crumbling. The choice is to happily do the repairs (re-practice, re-focus) or complain that things should stay perfect.

15. **The Broken Laptop/Hard Drive:** Speaker A uses a personal story of fixing electronics with a curious, playful, investigative mind—not with frustration. This models the attitude Speaker B should adopt toward their own mental "glitches."

16. **Holding Your Breath:** This is a powerful **experiential story/technique** within the dialogue. By having Speaker B hold their breath, they create a direct, physical experience of *wanting* (air) and then profound satisfaction upon getting it. It proves that satisfaction is possible and breaks the complaint cycle momentarily.

17. **The Lie vs. The Truth:** Speaker B feels that saying "I'm satisfied" is lying. Speaker A reframes this: the old, ingrained thoughts ("I'm a failure," "I must have X to be happy") are the real **lies**. Repeating the new, wholesome thought ("I'm okay") feels like a lie only because you're addicted to the old, false narrative.

These metaphors and stories collectively build the argument: **Stop chasing permanent results (the photograph), embrace the cyclical process (the movie, the elevator), and find satisfaction in the present moment by letting go of wanting and complaining.**
