### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Talking, and but I kind of forgot what I was ranting about. But I know ultimately I did talk at— I said something along the line of like, somehow the more I live in a real reality, even though I'm actually at that time, at that time I feel very anxious because I feel like there's nowhere to run. It sounds so, I don't know, but that's how I felt at that time. Like, I just feel like this is all the thing I have to face. Maybe at some part I also, like you said, I'm kind of living in the conceptual reality. That's why I feel overwhelmed. I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** Most people spend most of their time in a made-up reality in their head. And we spend very little time actually investigating reality. This is what the real practice of the Buddha is, is to investigate. Remember to investigate. Remember to look at the way things are, both on the inside and the outside. But we start with the inside. To begin to recognize that we do spend most of our time on the inside thinking about things instead of actually observing things. And so we observe the mind making stuff up, thinking about things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And now we have to make a decision: is that wholesome or not? In other words, am I making up something that's close to actual reality, or am I making up something dangerous? Am I making up work that needs to be done? Then in fact, you just mentioned that you were anxious or tense. That comes from— the feelings come from unwholesome thoughts that you literally talked yourself into anxiety. And you've probably been doing it for so long that you're very, very good at it. And so it doesn't take much talking to get into anxiety. Maybe a thought moment, tenth of a second.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so can you now talk yourself out of anxiety? That's a skill that you don't have developed very well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now, what is actually real then? Anxiety or freedom from anxiety?

**Speaker A:** See, that's a tricky question. I don't know how to answer that.

**Speaker B:** Because you think— Well, humans are full of anxiety because they talk themselves into it delusionally. But if you don't talk yourself into anxiety, then your natural state would be not no anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So we can go the difference between normal and natural. Anxiety is normal because it's frequent and it happens because people talk themselves into it. But freedom from anxiety would be a natural state.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is interesting because, I mean, the idea of understanding this anxiety is nothing new to me. But when you are talking about anxiety is normal but not natural, I just remember, like, ever since I was very young, this sounds so stupid, like I kind of just— when people ask me what I'm thinking, it's almost like I'm trying to fake that I'm worried about something to some degree, because I feel like when I'm faking worry about something to a certain degree, people will think like, oh, you know, he's part of this.

**Speaker B:** Could it be that when people ask you that question, what are you thinking, you have determined that the right answer is is what they would want you to be thinking about. Yeah, they want you to believe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because if you disagree with them, it might be dangerous. And so here comes the anxiety. Yeah, you can't be honest with people about what you're thinking because you've already put the filter on it. Oh, I've got to please them, and not pleasing them is dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, name me someone who doesn't do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So when you were a really little kid, you got yourself into the habit of being anxious and uptight because you were trying to please other people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, this is crazy because I, I mean, I, I've been always been very observant and self-aware of where my sudden root source is, but I don't— I have no idea why talking to you suddenly I just realized this. Like, it might seem so obvious, but I mean, yeah. And it's almost like crazy.

**Speaker B:** You use the word crazy.

**Speaker A:** Well, what does that mean?

**Speaker B:** Does that mean it's stupid?

**Speaker A:** No, no, it's not. It's— I don't mean it that way. It's just Oh, you're using crazy in.

**Speaker B:** The sense of it's surprising.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's surprising.

**Speaker B:** I haven't heard before.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's surprising because I'm very well— I watch— I'm not sure how to say it. I think I will consider myself as very aware and kind of smart in these sort of things. I can always pinpoint where certain things come from.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's an opinion that you have of yourself. And yet you still speak of having anxiety. Aren't those two things contradictory? Or maybe the anxiety comes from the order that, oh, you're supposed to be self-aware.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that. Like, not— I mean, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so by admitting that you're not aware That creates anxiety.

**Speaker A:** I would say a very low level, like very subtle, like very subtle, but yeah, something like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, things build up like a dripping faucet will eventually fill up a bucket.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Yeah, I agree. But I mean, I just want to say that Um, but yeah, now that I know this is when I was a kid, I, I had to pretend. Yeah, and it's almost like if I were to say— I mean, if I were to look back, if I were to say, oh, I'm not thinking anything, I'm not, I have no thoughts in my head, I feel like I would feel exposed. And like you said, exposed to danger, because people will be like, how can you be not thinking about I don't know, I don't know, it's just something like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S sort of like I think I conditioned myself into—.

**Speaker B:** I imagine that you also do that even when the people are not there standing there, that they don't require an answer because they're not there, but you're still making up answers. For them. Yeah, because we got into the habit of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like this conceptual reality.

**Speaker B:** This is what the real teaching is, is begin to look at the kind of thoughts that you're having. For instance, if you're thinking about someone that's not standing right there, why are you thinking thoughts about them? Okay, why don't we live in reality instead of our imagined reality? And the answer is because of that perceived issue of danger. Oh, I should be ready for them. I should have the answer ready. So this is one of the things to start watching for when you're alone doing what we call practice. Some people call it meditation, but I want to take at least a second to talk about about that, that meditation is actually cogitation. They even write poems and call it a meditation, which is nothing more than conceptualization. We don't practice conceptualization. We don't practice meditation. What we're practicing is watching how we think so that we can make a choice. And one of the choices would be then, is better to be here now than it is to be off someplace else thinking about someone else who's not here, not now, and thinking up things that we want to say to them. So we're actually in the past and then in the future, and we go back and forth between the past and the future rather than being here, right here, right now, in the present moment. That's a major part of the teaching. Why? Is because almost all of the Dukkha, all of our dissatisfactions, are based upon the past, and most of our future is based upon trying to fix the broken past so that we'll feel okay. But while we're doing it in the here and now, thinking about the past and planning for the future, we don't feel good. We don't feel great, we have anxiety. And so what we need to do instead is to recognize, oh, I'm thinking about some other place, some other time. Let me come and be in the here-now and recognize it right here, right now. I'm safe, especially if you're alone. If you're in a room alone, then you're safe. There's no alligators on the floor. There's nobody yelling at you. There is no— there's no mob boss there with a gun to your head. And yet we feel like that we've got to be ready for anything. And the— and the— that's correct, but in a different context. And that is, to be ready for anything means that whatever happens is not dangerous. That always we make the danger up. That we don't live in an environment where animals come around, like tigers and elephants tromping on us and all that kind of stuff. Our life, our world is not a dangerous place.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when you mentioned about alligators and all these dangerous animals, I was just I'm curious because the Buddha always kind of encouraged people to— I don't know, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Buddha encouraged people to live in the wilderness because that's where people maybe, I don't know, find spiritual growth or anything. But I realize, is it also because when you're living in the wilderness, you are more in touch with reality because there is danger, and but it's not—.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, like, occasionally there's danger, and then in fact you could see the possibility of someone out in nature, and that is a dangerous place or a dangerous moment, and he's not even aware of it because he's thinking about some other dangers someplace else.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so the whole quality is to start to be aware of what's happening right now. Yes, occasionally Certainly there are dangers in the here-now, but 99% of all the dangers are made up in the brain, in the mind. And while we're making stuff up, we're not paying attention to what's happening in reality. And so reality becomes even more dangerous because we're not paying attention, we're worried about other dangers.

**Speaker A:** I mean, yeah, it sounds so obvious, but I always forgot. I've forgotten about it. And yeah, um, I have speechless because I, I know that reminding this to myself is kind of calling me out. For the past few days, that's what I've been doing. Like, I'm adding unnecessary anxiety on top of what I should be focusing on. And it's like a wild goose chase. I'm chasing something that—.

**Speaker B:** Actually, there is— the goose is not wild. There is no goose. Yeah, yeah, but you're just out there chasing in the mind as if there was a goose, as if it were wild. And the fact that right now there's.

**Speaker A:** No goose— yeah, so, so I was listening to one of I guess one of your, one of your Sangha, where you guys were having a group video call, and last night, and in one of the video you're talking about everything's broken and needing to be fixed, as in like this is this weird mentality we're putting ourselves in.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's how people think. The reality is that things are just fine, things are not broken. But we go around, we have been trained from childhood that things need to be done. When we're really little, we start to be ordered around. Go clean your room, do your homework, all kinds of things. And so we, we as children learn to try to meet other people's expectations. We get in the habit of doing that. And then we can even live our whole lives that way without ever considering that that stuff just all made up. We made it up. We became habit-bound by it, and so we continuously make stuff up rather than living in reality. We live in our thought world. So can you begin to change that? Can you begin to have thoughts about what's happening right now? Wholesome thoughts like, right now everything is okay, right now everything's just fine, not a worry in the world, no problems. Because that's real. Right now there are no problems, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, but you can think them up about problems that will be in the future, or maybe problems in the past, but right now you don't have any problems. So let us start to practice being in that state of having no problems, because most of the time you don't have problems, and yet most of the time you're thinking up problems.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Is it weird that— so I experienced this quite a few times, like even when I'm talking to Kat, and when Kat reminded me of this exactly, something similar of what you're saying, sometimes I find a part of my brain is like resisting, and I feel like during those moments, should I be aware that my mind is resisting this?

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, have you ever seen a truck or a car get stuck in a rut and people trying to push it out? Okay, so you could say that the car actually likes the rut. Yeah, it wants to stay there. It's hard to push the truck out of the rut.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so the mind gets stuck in a rut too, and it's hard to push the mind out of the rut. But you keep changing it. You keep coming out of the rut and coming out of the rut, and pretty soon you gain the skill of being able to come out of the ruts of the mind. That in fact, the word rut here is what we're meaning by the word habit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that. Yeah, my mind definitely loves— there's a certain clinging to wanting to stay at that place where I just know it's going to lead me down the rabbit hole. But yeah, wholesome thoughts. Yeah, Cat did tell me a lot about the right effort in just small amount of just enough effort in trying to reframe it. And I guess that's why early on I kind of say I took it seriously, because I really did see how it shifts my perspective in all things. But like, but as you said, there's this instinct of like, it's just going back to old habits. It's like this constant up and down. Will you say this is reality, that it's just gonna be up and down? I'm not sure, like, in terms of habit.

**Speaker B:** Well, your made-up reality is not reality.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And one can say, in fact, that Dukkha is when our made-up reality is far away from the actual reality. And the closer our made-up reality is to actual reality, the less Dukkha, the less dissatisfaction we have.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** For instance, if you're just sitting with no place to go and nothing to do, your natural state would be that you don't want anything. And yet we sit there thinking up stuff that we want to do, stay thinking up stuff we want to have. All right, so when we want something we don't have, the reality is, is that we don't have it. If we want it and don't have it, that's dissatisfaction. The reality is that we don't have it. If we could come to, oh, I don't have that then you're okay. But when you say, oh, I don't have it and I want it, now you're in a state of Dukkha, state of dissatisfaction. And you have been spending, as most people do most of the time, thinking about things that are not done, thinking about things that you want to do, thinking about things that you don't have. And then you wind up with anxiety over it because you don't have what you want. You're far away from reality. And so we need to start practicing seeing that we do that a lot, to start examining what thoughts we're having. Not as I'm talking, you, you're conceptualizing But the right way I'm talking about it is to sit down and start watching the kind of thoughts that you're having so that you can make a change to those thoughts and come back into the reality. And reality is that everything's okay.

**Speaker A:** What if— what if certain— I mean, so There's a lot, there's a few times in my life when I want something and then I just say, oh, I don't have that, and that's okay. There's a lot of freedom in that feeling. But sometimes, what if my mind just goes there? Like, it's kind of like holding it, and I—.

**Speaker B:** So can you catch it going there? That's just an old habit. That's the whole point, is that when you go into that state of desire, in state of wanting, Can you catch that and say, oh, I don't have to think about that right now, I'm okay right now? This takes practice. It takes repetition over and over and over again. Already well practiced and well rehearsed into having the kind of thoughts that create anxiety. Now you have to practice a new tune.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. You too. So as you said just now, I don't have to have it right now. Would you say this is a skillful way of tricking the mind? That's it, like right now we don't need to have it, and then it's okay, and then you just let go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind, because when you're thinking about something that you want the mind goes downhill. It goes into desire, wanting, into dissatisfaction, into fear, and into anxiety. Sometimes that happens really fast.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, yeah, it goes really fast. Like, it's almost Yeah, it's like, it's like going off a slippery hill. I just— it just like, it just go very fast. Oh my God.

**Speaker B:** So either before you get there or after you get there, can you wake up to the process? Can you wake up to the fact that you've landed someplace or that you're about to go there and make a change? 'Oh wow, I'm glad I see that.'.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** 'Oh wow, I'm glad I didn't go that way.' All right. 'Oh wow, I'm glad I can get myself out of that.' Now the Buddha himself had a phrase that was exactly that, but the words of language was different. The language that he used was, 'Aha, I see you, Mara.' Oh yeah, I see the difficulty. Aha, I see the problem. Aha, I see that anxiety coming on. And that aha, I see it, is part of the change. Because you're either in it and don't see it, or you do see it and then you can just— you can exclaim, aha, I see that. And that's part of the change that we need to make. Recognize what we're doing that creates discomfort, dissatisfaction for ourselves. Even having a rule, oh, you should not be dissatisfied. Well, that's a rule that creates anxiety. And you can say, wow, I'm glad I see that I've got that rule. Aha, I see you, Mara. And then we can just relax, rather than getting more uptight because we saw that we had gotten uptight. And we've got a rule, thou shalt not be uptight.

**Speaker A:** It kind of— I definitely agree. Well, when I was talking to Ken, he always kind of reminds me how the rules I set up for myself, I shouldn't do this, in a way it's I'm not sure was this how he said, but in my interpretation, it's like it caused suffering. Um, I, I feel like it's tricky, uh, Dhammarato, like, because I'm not sure, like, sometimes, um, when I get relaxed and, like, I telling myself there's no rules, sometimes I don't know, it just goes back to doing bad habits. So I'm not sure, like maybe it's just all about awareness, right? I mean, I don't know, like a part of me feels like it will help, but as always, every time I say I shouldn't do that, it just goes down this rabbit hole. So I'm not sure, like I guess it's just awareness. So repetition.

**Speaker B:** So this is why we need to practice. This is in fact the Eightfold Noble Path that I've been talking about. The Eightfold Noble Path of remembering, to remember to be here now, to remember to investigate, to see that you're often not here now. You're all conceptualizations. You're off in other places. You're off in other times. You're off with other people that are not here. All right, so that's the first thing, is to be aware of the kind of thoughts that you're thinking, which means to remember to investigate and then make a change. Those three things run in circle around each other it almost becomes the same skill. And along with that, then we also remember to take a deep breath, to start adding your breathing to it. So why is— because when people are looking at the breath, they're looking at this breath right here, right now. Thinking about and working with the breath keeps you in the present moment. As opposed to nobody thinks or has a meditation when they're thinking about the breath that they were taking last year, or even early this morning, or some future breath. No, let's work with this breath, the one we're having right here, right now. We can also relax the body. We don't remember relaxing the body yesterday. In fact, we think about relaxing the body right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I felt it. This kind of goes back to early on I said, when I notice my mind is clinging on to something, And maybe I can, in a skillful way, telling the mind that, hey, I don't have to have you right now. And then he's like, oh, you know what, you're right. And then you let go. What if— I mean, I think I'm answering my own question here. It's like, what if— because this is usually the pattern I fall into— I will let go, and then instinctively there's a part of my voice that says, well, what if I want it later? Or if I want it tomorrow again? This whole cycle continues. It's like my mind just goes through this. The wild goose chase where the goose doesn't exist.

**Speaker B:** You were trained that way. Time to retrain.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's time to retrain.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Time to retrain those habits. This is why we want to practice over and over again, learning a new tune, because we spend all the time on the old tune, that while we're practicing the new tune, the likelihood of us breaking out into the old tune is very high. And so we have to remember that we're making a new tune, and the new tune is a happy song, not a dirge.

**Speaker A:** Can I? I had a question about working relationship. This is about professional, right? When I'm meeting my clients or working with other colleagues, I had a question about that because I know that there are just times maybe you could say I'm living in conceptual reality. I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** Right now you're conceptualizing about— and I'll listen to all the stuff that we've been talking about, and here you go thinking about other people at work and whatnot. So I just caught you doing it. All right, so let's not think about those people. That in fact, if you can keep your mind happy right here, right now, when you're in presence of those other people, you can continue keeping the mind happy right here, right now. You can actually begin to spread your joy. Right now you've been spreading your misery and anxiety to other people. Just change that. Start practicing right here, right now. To be here, right here, right now, because everything right now is okay. And immediately you start making crap up. The my love— how do I handle those people? The answer to that is, why don't you handle your own mind right here, right now? And if you can gain the skill of doing that, you can handle your mind right here, right right now, even when there's other people around.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, thank you for catching me there. Uh, yeah, I agree.

**Speaker B:** Um, so this is the practice, is to start looking at what we're doing right here, right now, and make a change. We want to make it start simple.

**Speaker A:** Simple, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because, right, because when you're around other people, you've got their Dukkha to deal with as well as your own, which means that you've multiplied the amount of Dukkha. So get away from all those other people so that you can get away from them in your mind.

**Speaker A:** Also. Now that you say it, I can feel my mind going a bit more still, like just how it was like.

**Speaker B:** So start to remember that you cause yourself grief and disgust and despair when you're thinking about other people. So stop thinking about other people. Spend time thinking about right now. There's nobody here. Isn't that marvelous? Isn't it great? Right in here, right now, everything is hunky-dory. Everything is beautiful. And you're much better off by not thinking about other people. As soon as you start thinking about other people— I mean, you remember you asked the question, well, how do I handle them? Well, there's your anxiety, there's your Fear. By thinking about other people, you bring up all of that crap. So stay away from other people. Be in the present moment. Learn to get your mind in a really good state, and then you can deal with other people when your mind is in really good state. You don't let their Dukkha pull you down into your Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Is that missing? So many Dukkha together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, we in our neighborhood, we call that a pity party. Misery loves company.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just caught myself again, like my mind just says, like, well, but there's a good thing about negative emotions. It kind of— I'm not sure if it's the ego that is just scared of letting go of some of it. I don't know. Okay, um, can I just— just one last question actually, uh, is Because I really love this idea of reminding myself, you know, like I am the lion, in a wholesome way, like I could deal with things, I don't need things from people. Maybe, maybe, I just realized.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] It's not, here's the point. It's not a concept, and yet when I talk about it, it becomes a concept. Basically, we're looking at if you're feeling really good right now because there's nothing happening and everything is okay, then you're on top of the situation, especially when you realize that, aha, I can be satisfied. Aha, I know how to be satisfied. That means that success is coming. Aha, I am successful. At being satisfied. And then the feeling of being the boss, the feeling of being a champion, the feeling of you're in charge of your life, is that feeling of being the lion. It's no longer a concept, it's an experience. The experience of, wow, this is great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, this makes, this makes so much sense. Because what you talk about is a concept, what you experience is not a concept. Yeah, I think I have my answers.

**Speaker B:** So let's stop conceptualizing and start experiencing. Conceptualization is mental, it's not being here now, it's a thought process about being the lion off into the future instead of experiencing the feeling of, wow, it is so nice to be successful, I can control my mind.

**Speaker A:** It's also scary. I mean, it feels— I mean, for me, it feels scary, at least now. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Well, that pickup truck says, oh, if I get out of this rut, I'll have to go out for gone through the road someplace, and the road is scary. And here you are stuck in a rut thinking about that it's somehow scary into the future, to where you absolutely know for a fact that being comfortable right here, right now is not scary, it's not dangerous, that you have protection. The reality is a protection from your own concepts about it being dangerous. Oh my God.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. Okay, yeah, I see that now. Yeah, sorry. I find it so interesting. I always think that reality is— We.

**Speaker B:** Like being in our old habit patterns in a way, because changing is dangerous. It's scary. We can label it in the realm of fear of the unknown. In politics, they say, better the devil that we know than the devil that we don't. And that's just stupid intellectual— actually, it's not intellectual, instinctual behavior of, oh, I don't know what it is, therefore it must be dangerous. But you do know what it is. You have been happy in your life. You have been okay in the present moment. So you know that that's real. You've already got the experience of it. Let's start practicing so that it happens often.

**Speaker A:** I often trick myself into thinking reality is scary, but most of the time is the conceptual reality are living in that feels like the reality is scary. I think it makes sense, yeah. Well, this is difficult, but yeah, I'm gonna do it. All right.

**Speaker B:** Well, it would be wise for you to listen to this video. It's right there on your screen available right after the call is finished.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And review this over and over again.

**Speaker A:** I will.

**Speaker B:** All right, and so let's go ahead and finish the call now, and you can call me in a few days, but you need to start practicing this.

**Speaker A:** I will, I will. All right, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Okay, have a nice— well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** See you guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), centers on a core Buddhist practice: shifting from a **conceptual, thought-based reality** to **direct experience of the present moment** in order to end suffering (Dukkha).

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Problem: Living in a "Made-Up" Reality**
*   We spend most of our time in a conceptual world—thinking about the past, planning for the future, imagining scenarios, and worrying about people who aren't present.
*   This habit, often formed in childhood to please others or feel safe, leads us away from actual reality.
*   **Anxiety and dissatisfaction (Dukkha) arise from this gap** between our conceptual stories (what we want, fear, or think we should be) and the actual reality of the present moment.

**2. The Core Practice: Investigation and Choice**
*   The real practice is to **investigate** and **observe the mind** to see when it is "making stuff up."
*   We must then make a **choice**: Are these thoughts wholesome (close to reality) or unwholesome (creating danger and anxiety)?
*   The goal is to recognize that our **natural state**, when not adding unwholesome thoughts, is peaceful and free from anxiety. Anxiety is "normal" due to habit, but it is not our "natural" state.

**3. The Method: Returning to "Here and Now"**
*   The antidote is to continually return awareness to the **present moment** ("here-now").
*   In the present, especially when alone, we are usually safe. The perceived dangers are almost entirely mental constructs.
*   Practice involves:
    *   **Catching the mind** wandering into conceptualization (past/future/other people) and gently noting it ("Aha, I see you, Mara").
    *   **Re-framing thoughts** to align with present reality: "Right now, everything is okay. I have no problems right now."
    *   Using anchors like the **breath** or **body relaxation** to stay grounded in the immediate experience.

**4. Retraining the Habit**
*   The mind is stuck in deep ruts of habitual anxious thinking. Changing this requires **consistent practice and repetition** to learn a "new tune" of wholesome, present-moment awareness.
*   This is the essence of the **Eightfold Noble Path**: Remembering to investigate, making a skillful change, and using tools like breath awareness to stay present.

**5. Application with Others**
*   When thinking about others (like colleagues), we often create anxiety and "multiply Dukkha."
*   The solution is not to figure them out conceptually, but to **first master keeping your own mind happy and present when alone**. This skill then allows you to interact without being pulled into shared "misery loves company" dynamics.

**6. From Concept to Experience**
*   The aim is not to adopt new concepts (e.g., "I am a lion"), but to **directly experience** the confidence and satisfaction that comes from being in charge of your own mind and finding contentment in the present.
*   The fear of letting go of old, familiar anxious habits is natural ("fear of the unknown"), but we already have experience of moments of peace—we must practice extending those moments.

**In essence:** The talk is a practical guide to undoing the habit of living in stressful stories and learning to reside in the peaceful reality of the present moment through mindful investigation and gentle, persistent re-training of attention.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk to illustrate the teachings:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Made-up Reality vs. Actual Reality:** The core metaphor contrasting the conceptual, story-based world in our heads with the direct experience of the present moment.
2.  **The Dripping Faucet:** Used to describe how small, subtle anxieties and thought patterns accumulate over time to fill up and overwhelm us ("things build up like a dripping faucet will eventually fill up a bucket").
3.  **The Vehicle Stuck in a Rut:** Represents the mind trapped in habitual, unwholesome thought patterns. The effort to change is likened to pushing a car out of a deep rut; the mind, like the car, seems to "like the rut" and resists leaving it.
4.  **Learning a New Tune / Old Tune:** The process of retraining the mind is compared to practicing a new, happy song to replace an old, familiar "dirge" or lament.
5.  **The Wild Goose Chase:** Describes the futile pursuit of anxieties and desires that have no basis in present reality ("the goose is not wild. There is no goose").
6.  **Going Down a Rabbit Hole:** Illustrates how the mind can quickly spiral into deep, repetitive, and unwholesome thought patterns.
7.  **Going Off a Slippery Hill:** Emphasizes how quickly thoughts can accelerate from a simple desire into full-blown anxiety and dissatisfaction ("it just goes very fast").
8.  **The Lion:** Represents the **experience** (not just the concept) of being confident, in charge, and fearless—the "boss" or "champion" of one's own mind and life.
9.  **A Pity Party / Misery Loves Company:** Describes how sharing and amplifying dissatisfaction (Dukkha) with others creates a collective negative state.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Speaker A's Childhood Story:** Speaker A recalls that from a young age, he felt he had to pretend to be worried about something when asked "What are you thinking?" to fit in and feel safe. This story is used to trace the root of his habitual anxiety to a learned need to please others and a fear of being exposed or in danger for having a calm mind.
2.  **The Buddha's Wilderness Reference:** Speaker A brings up the idea that the Buddha encouraged living in the wilderness. Speaker B reframes this, suggesting the point isn't the external danger, but that in nature, one might be *actually* in danger yet unaware because the mind is preoccupied with *imagined* dangers from elsewhere. This underscores the teaching to pay attention to actual present-moment reality.
3.  **The Buddha and Mara:** Speaker B references a story/teaching device from the Buddhist texts. When unwholesome thoughts or temptations (personified as the demon **Mara**) arose, the Buddha would say, **"Aha, I see you, Mara."** This is presented as a model for practice: the simple, non-judgmental recognition of an unwholesome thought pattern is the first step to disarming it.
4.  **The "Everything's Broken" Mentality:** Speaker A references a previous talk about the common habit of seeing the world as broken and needing to be fixed. Speaker B explains this as a conditioning from childhood, where we are trained to meet others' expectations ("go clean your room"), leading to a lifelong habit of living in a "to-do list" reality instead of the peaceful reality where things are already okay.

### **Key Conceptual Frameworks (which stories/metaphors explain)**

*   **Conceptual Reality vs. Actual Reality:** Explained through the "made-up reality," "wild goose chase," and "rabbit hole" metaphors.
*   **Habit (Rut) and Retraining:** Explained through the "car in a rut," "old tune/new tune," and childhood conditioning stories.
*   **Anxiety as Normal but Not Natural:** Explained through the childhood story and the "dripping faucet" metaphor.
*   **The Practice of Awareness:** Explained through the "Aha, I see you, Mara" story and the metaphor of catching the mind going "down a slippery hill."
*   **The Present Moment as Safe and Sufficient:** Explained through the contrast with the scary "conceptual reality" and the instruction to notice that when alone, "there's no alligators on the floor."
