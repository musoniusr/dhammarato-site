### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, it's more like— oh, sorry.

**Speaker B:** So to introduce, this is the afternoon Sangha. It's 4 PM on Saturday, and we've got several people here on this call that are actually on the island, mostly myself and Michael and David. Um, Dietrich, where are you? You're in Europe someplace, I'm sure.

**Speaker A:** I'm in the Netherlands.

**Speaker B:** Netherlands. Okay. And Callum, where are you? I am currently in the UK. All right. And Ross has just announced he's in Australia. Alex, where are you? I'm in the UK as well. And Yu-Chan, Ross, where are you? I'm in China. In China, yeah, that's right. And Thomas, where are you? In Finland. In Finland, okay. And Ivan, where are you?

**Speaker A:** Oh.

**Speaker B:** You laughed. Okay, so Dietrich, you're starting to have a question, and we were talking before the call started about water in Thailand and water ceremonies. Oh, Ivan, you're back! Where are you? Sorry, I got this. I'm in Malaysia. Yeah, I'm from Malaysia. Okay. Yes, I remember. So, Dietrich, you were asking questions about the water ceremony and funerals and letting go and all that. Please continue.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, David started it, but it took me to the subject I wanted to ask something about, like about attachment. Like, um, so As I understood, attachment will create Dukkha in your life, but I'm very attached.

**Speaker B:** Actually, ignorant attachment. We'll go into it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, because I'm very attached to my family and I also find joy in that and I don't like to let them go. And now I'm about to sell my house And I'm also attached to my house, but there's a reason for it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hey Michael, can you just fix whatever happened?

**Speaker A:** We're in the college room again.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** It is funny.

**Speaker B:** All right, so I kind of got the gist of it. Let's start with the number one attachment that everyone has is the attachment to being alive. It's built into our DNA. It is instinctual. It comes out of our nature. And that the scientists call it the self-preservation instinct. Benny's calling. I knew he would. But Michael, will you tell Benny that we're on the group here? Yes, maybe if I can do that. Let's see if I can do that for Vinaya. All right, so back to where we were starting from. So that number one attachment, which is built into our DNA, is the basis for all attachment. Yeah, Vinaya's saying, can I join? Let me see if I could figure out how to do that. I don't know how to add a new participant to the group. I know how to get group people on the call. Nope, that doesn't work. Sorry. Michael, do you know how to get Vinaya on the group? How do I send his Thought he knew what we were doing.

**Speaker A:** Bodhisattva.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he was there. All right, wow, it's really handy to have you. So as we're getting started about attachment, let's repeat that because it's so important that you understand that there is a built-in In order to be alive, you have to have a self-preservation instinct. Imagine a female dog just giving birth to a litter of puppies. They're popping out. What do the puppies do? What's the first thing that they do? They start crawling around and looking for something. And what are they looking for?

**Speaker A:** Their mother's titty.

**Speaker B:** That's right, they're looking for the tits. They're looking for Mama and the symbol of Mama. Okay, so this is how deeply buried it is into our life itself, is the first thing that we do is they want to be held and nurtured and warm and part of the family. This is why the instincts are broken into 4 groups. And the 4 groups are: the nursing is called a herding instinct, and it's called the nesting instinct, but it's also the nursing instinct. And that this is secondary to the primary instinct of self-preservation. And so, these instincts, when wisely used, will keep you alive and keep you happy. But we have to do it wisely, because, Dietrich, you mentioned that you have attachments to your family, and that they give you great joy. Right? That's because you're practicing it wisely. You could practice it unwisely and order your children around, and they would rebel and start hating their mom, and that would destroy the family. But you're controlling them because of the instinct, of the motherly instinct, of wanting to hold that baby to protect it, even though he's 18 years old and got a gun. All right, so that's the way that we do it stupidly or ignorantly. And there is such a thing as wise attachment as well as ignorant attachment. Now, in the Mahayana Buddhism, they actually say that Dukkha, the source of Dukkha, is in fact attachment, and that's completely Incorrect. The Buddha in the Four Noble Truths says most specifically that the source of Dukkha, the creation of Dukkha, the cause of Dukkha is because we like things, our feelings, and we don't like things, our feelings, and we're often mixed in our feelings. Confused in our feelings. We like it and we don't like it both at the same time. Like the baby loves getting held by mom while she's there getting the nurse to give the baby a shot, and so both she likes being held and nurtured and she doesn't like the shot all at the same time. And so that gives rise to a kind of a confused feeling. And always, the confused feeling rots into not liking. We don't like to be ignorant, we don't like to be confused. And so, the not liking the confusion is always done ignorantly. This is why humans, especially in our society, struggle for the thirst of knowledge. Hello, Vinaya, glad to see that you've joined. Hi, Dhammarato. So as we continue to live our lives ignorantly, we like things and we don't like things, and we behave according to our likes and our dislikes. Rather than looking wisely. That in fact, we often don't even know that we don't like something. We don't even know that we don't like not knowing. And yet there we are, driven with a thirst for knowledge. We want to know, we want to know, we want to know. Why is that? Because we don't like not knowing. We don't like being confused. So, the whole point then is that these feelings of liking and not liking are based in ignorance, and that there's two kinds of ignorance. There is wise ignorance and foolish ignorance. And wise ignorance is ignorance that we don't know something and we know that we don't know it. And then the foolish ignorance is that we don't know it, and so we'll make something up. And that actually is the basis for all religions, it's the basis for astronomy, it's the basis for astrology, it's the basis for tarot cards, it's the basis for the magic and fortune-telling and religions and rebirth and reincarnation and all of that stuff is that humans make up stories to make themselves feel good because they don't like not knowing. And yet we can develop through our practice to be okay with not knowing. Here's an example of that: In the United States, they've got an election coming up in November, and everybody's kind of worried about it, on the internet and on YouTube and on the cable TVs and on television and all of that, pontificating about what they think is going to happen. And in fact, you could think of it as one of the things that's happened with news, is in the old days, news was when the reporters, the newspapers, etc., told you what happened. But nowadays, the news is all about predicting the future, about what we want to happen, because nobody is very comfortable with just not knowing what's going to happen. And yet we don't know what's going to happen. We don't like that. We want an answer, even if the answer is wrong. We would better off have an answer than to do without. How many of you have ever experienced that, is that you look for satisfaction by looking for answers to something when in fact you could have complete satisfaction without knowing. And yet we want to know. Yeah. So that state of— in fact, the real deep part of it is that we really want to know how to feel. We don't like being confused. An example is, is that if I know Donald Trump is going to win the election, then at least I know. If I know that Biden is going to win the election, at least I know. And so I can make a prediction and I can feel good now. But the reality is, is I don't know who's going to win the election. Nobody does. One of the things that we do know is, is that the polls are out there trying to predict the future. And it's impossible to do that. Why? It's because scientifically, it's impossible to get a poll that's actually accurate. And not only that, but people change their minds. And one of the things about polls is that the pollsters are there as an observer, and people will tell the observer what they want to hear. So it depends upon the attitude of the pollster as to what the person is going to say about who they're going to vote for. Or maybe they're ashamed that they love Trump, and so they'll say that they're going to vote for Biden and all of this kind of stuff. And so polls are very inaccurate. They have always been, but they're getting even more inaccurate. The harder they try to make polls accurate, the less accurate they are. And why am I dwelling on polls is because of that deep inside nature of, we don't like to not know. And so, we're curious about the polls. What are the polls going to say? Why don't we throw some dice or some bones, because that's just as reliable as the polls? In fact, the elections themselves are unreliable. But at least they have a definitive thing, so they can count votes and say, "Okay, this guy's got more votes than that guy, and so he's the winner." But as you can tell, a whole lot of people in the United States don't believe that. They think that the polls are rigged, because the poll didn't go their way. Now, this wanting to know is based back in the instinct. That in fact, the self-preservation instinct kind of wants to know, because we want to know how to live our lives. And the answer is, is that you don't need to know much of anything about the world, because the way that you're going to learn to live your life depends upon the inside of your mind, not the polls, not the outside, not the politics, not the world, and yet we keep looking for the world to gain our, let us say, security. We want to feel secure in an insecure world, and so the way to really handle that through the practice of Anapanasati is to start nurturing yourself and telling yourself that everything is okay, that everything is going to be all right, and that there's no reason to worry and fret over the future at all. That it's okay that we don't know. In fact, I've had students who have called on Skype and asked question after question after question, even when I'm giving them fairly detailed instructions on how to practice Anapanasati, they still keep having a lot of questions. Well, guess what? The practice that we're doing is actually very simple. The teachings of the Buddha are very, very simple, but they're hard to grasp, they're hard to understand because it goes against all that we've been taught. And so we try to get the context of the teaching of the Buddha and the practice of Anapanasati not in the context that it belongs in, but in the context of all the stuff that someone understands. And so they wind up asking question after question after question, and all of those questions are generally irrelevant. That the basic thing that we need to do is to remember to look at the thoughts, the feelings, the comfort of the body, to look at the state of mind that we have—those four items, the Satipatthana. And change. We can change our thoughts from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. We can change our fear into the feeling of being safe and secure and comfortable. We can change the body from being uncomfortable into a state of comfort. And a major part of that also is we can change our attitude from the attitude of being a victim victim to that outside world that's so scary, into a winner that is completely confident that whatever the world has to offer, we can handle that. And this is a very simple practice that we have. We practice it over and over again because we have been practicing for so long of depending upon the outside world to determine how we feel. Rather than determining how we feel because we want to feel a certain way, and so we just feel that way. In other words, we're actually a victim to our feelings when we're out of control of our feelings. If we don't like something, we can notice that we don't like it and then set it aside and start looking at something that we do like so that we can feel good. An example of that is that the dinner plate fell on the floor. It had the entire family's meal on that plate, and everybody's upset and unhappy, but then the dog is there eating the food and he's enjoying it. The family is not going to enjoy the dog eating the food, but they could. They could say, "Wow, look at the dog, he really likes it, it must have been very good." So, we can change our attitude right then and there about the lost dinner. And everybody can laugh and joke about it, and then get some more food in the kitchen or whatever. So, there's actually no reason for us to feel bad. But we choose to feel bad, because we were taught to feel bad when we were children. When mom lost something, she felt bad, and the little kid sees mom feeling bad when she's lost something, and so now the child is trained to be unhappy when the child loses something. If mom could train her child, it's okay that we lost something, we didn't need it anyway. If we really needed it, we would have held it tightly and we wouldn't have lost it. And so we pick up bad feelings and we practice those bad feelings over and over and over again. And so we worry about losing things, then in fact we're not, let us say, in any danger at all of losing them, but we still have that fear of losing something. And that fear of loss always goes back to that innate self-preservation instinct and the fear of the loss of life. And yet almost everything that you lose doesn't kill you. Whatever you lose, it hadn't killed you. If you drop the cell phone and break it, the cell phone is broken, not you. But look how much of a pity party someone can have when they break their cell phone. That's because of that ignorant attachment, and that ignorant attachment really is, "I am that cell phone. When that cell phone is broken, I'm dying, or I'm in the danger of dying." So, let me take a break now and answer Deidre. You've got your hand up.

**Speaker A:** What you're saying is, the short version is, it's okay to ask questions inside, to examine yourself, to research your own thoughts, but to examine everything outside, that's not going to help you.

**Speaker B:** It's not going to help you. However, I would look at the language that you're just using, that we don't have to question what's on the inside other than making the distinction or the determination of whether this thought is wholesome and healthy or not. That's the only question that we need to ask, and it's really not a question, it's more of just a mere observation. Just look. The answer that we need is right here in front of us, even before we ask the question. The answer is self-evident. All we need to do is look.

**Speaker A:** That's not questioning, it's not like about questioning yourself, but more observing yourself, observing yourself.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Okay, so here's an example of it, and you'll find teenage girls doing this one a lot: Am I okay? Am I beautiful enough? Am I acceptable enough? Do I fit in? Okay, those kind of questions, every one of them is unwholesome. So instead of asking questions about ourselves, the right thing to do instead is to note: I'm asking myself, am I okay or not? Rather than recognizing directly, I am okay. So we stop asking the question, "Am I okay?" and start going into the positive, "Yeah, man, I'm all right. I'm okay." This is really the distinction then between wholesome and unwholesome, and we spend so much time unwholesome because we're questioning things because we want to know. And so, even another way of saying it is that when the teenage girl asks the question, "Am I okay?" The real answer to that is, it's not even important whether you're OK or not; you can still be happy even if you're not OK. Being OK or not OK is actually a kind of a judgment that's irrelevant. But really the answer is, of course you're OK, even if everybody in your class hates your guts. Probably the reason that they hate your guts is because you're worried about whether you're or not. And so you go around bullying them to get them on your side or whatever like that. Or maybe you're pleading with them to love you because you don't think that you're okay. And so really, that kind of question is completely irrelevant, and it's ignorant. It's an ignorant question because we don't know that We're asking unwholesome questions. And so this is the real point, is that it's not a matter of asking questions, it's a matter of direct observation about our own thoughts. And a lot of it again has to do with that issue of the self-preservation instinct, because the girl is actually asking, when she asks the question, "Am I Kokei?" that actually can be turned around into the question, "Am I going to survive?" Because let's say the fraternity or the clique that she's in is so important to her that it's a matter of life and death to her, and she doesn't even see that. She doesn't see that she's made something irrelevant important to her. That being in a girl's clique of 5 or 6 girls, and whether she's the odd man out in that clique or not, is completely irrelevant to whether she's going to be happy in this moment. If she's thinking about the clique, she's worried. And guess what? It's possibly true, or probably even true, that every girl in that clique, each one of them when they're alone, is worried about, do they fit into the clique? And the reality is that all of those girls are in the clique and I want in too, and none of those girls see the clique as the same clique. I'd like to offer you an actual piece of history. When I was studying psychology, At Huron Valley Institute, which was part of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, they would have a lot of very famous psychologists, Bender and Grunder, and some of them from California would come, well-known psychologists and whatever, and come do a weekend retreat or long discussions. And during one of these Someone brought up the issue about the insiders, the cliques, the in-group at the Institute, and who was on the inside and who was on the outside. And everybody there was worried and interested about, are they part of the group or not? And so it was Michael Brown, who was one of the senior instructors, there, he says, OK, it's time for a break. During the break, what we're going to do is you take a piece of paper and you write down 5 names of those people that you think are the in-group, the students who are in the clique, those who belong, those that are teacher's pets, those that are well-loved, those who have been around a long time, etc., like that. And so then they had a panel of people who would go and write it down about who got how many votes and whatever like that. And the surprise to me, I mean, I was really surprised that I was included as one of the insiders because I had always been my whole life as an outsider. And I was amazed that some enough people thought that I was on the inside that they would have chosen me. But guess what? Everyone who made the list of the insider was also quite surprised. And some of the people who consider themselves on the inside, the insiders, they didn't make the list. Okay, so what Michael was actually pointing out is, is that look how much ignorance there is in whether or not we belong to a group. I hope that we don't have those kind of cliques form with my friends. Ross, go ahead. Yeah, I mean, if you hand up—.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm just thinking, like, um, if you examine, like, the Buddha's life, you know, 2,500 years ago, he, he didn't want to be part of, you know, his, the royal kingdom, so he left that group. He didn't want to be a father, he left his wife, he left his kids. He then went in search of enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure that that's really the case. That's part of, let us say, the religious story, right? Okay, that's according to the research that has been done by a very famous group of Indian historians and researchers led by Ambedkar, who was, by the way, one of the primary founders of bringing Buddhism back to India. And now there's millions of people who were Buddhist, and he's done a lot of research as a college professor. And he has the story that in the time when Siddhartha was a young man, he actually was able to join the— oh, let us say the parliament of the Sakyans. And so he was on that inside group. And that they required fidelity and loyalty to the group. Now, what happened was, is that there was a flood, and the flood caused the change of the course of the river. And that puts the land bordering the river and where the water changed into a discrepancy. And so there was a neighboring tribe that was in conflict with the Sakyan tribe about who gets that land where the river changed, because they had originally historically been that the river determined their boundaries. Well, the river changed. Who keeps that old land? Did that island, which was probably great big, and the situation was, is that there is not enough food go around for everybody, that if one tribe gets that land and keeps it, then they will eat and the other tribe will not. And they couldn't share, and so they were about to go to war. In fact, it was the Sakyans that declared war over that piece of land. Now, Siddhartha did not want to go to war, and he voted against it. But he was outvoted, and so they required him, because of fidelity, that he has to stay on their side, that he not only would vote against war, he now is required to be part of that. And if he doesn't, then he's going to be an outcast. And so that's why he left. He not just left the Klan, but I mean not just the parliament, but he left the clan directly. His mother, his father, and everybody knew that he had to leave, because he refused to go to war. And so, when he left, he left with a horse, with his groom for the horse, he left with his teacher, he left with about 5 people. And they all left, and they left in the daytime. And he left saying goodbye to his mom and his dad, but his wife was sick and ill with the pregnancy. She was about to give birth, and she was asleep, so he didn't wake her up to say goodbye, but she knew he was leaving anyway. Now, it's interesting, what did she do in the time between he was off getting enlightened. And when he returned, while she was there alone, she actually also lived in seclusion. That she was the daughter of the, uh, actually the king of the other group. And so she was also, uh, in seclusion because she didn't want to be around either side either. Okay, so that seems to be the actual history of it. I've got maybe some of the facts a little bit wrong, but to end that story would be the story that when the Buddha, fully enlightened, comes back, when she sees him, she tells that son who is now 7 years old, go to your father and seek your inheritance. Because it sounded to her like he had abandoned his inheritance. And in fact, Ananda was now the king. Anagami, or the head dude of the Sakyan clan, because rightfully so that Siddhartha would have been that. And so when she said for her son to go get your heritage, she didn't know what she was saying, because you know what his heritage that Rahula received? He received a new name. He received a bowl and a robe, and he became a monk at the age of 7. That was his inheritance. And his mother was, oh, I made a mistake with that.

**Speaker C:** Wow, I've never heard that before. That's the first time. I've always went with the story he.

**Speaker B:** Left the house— that he wanted to get out, that he was, let us say, cloistered, and he couldn't get out. No, the Buddha, when he was Siddhartha Gautama, he was an excellent archer. He was best at everything. He was the prince. He was an elephant trainer. He was a horse trainer. He was a warrior. He was everything that a young prince should be. He was a bowman. He managed horses. He could ride horses. I mean, why would he take a horse with him? Especially with a groom, if he wasn't well established in horses. So, and in fact, a lot of the suttas that you'll find that he does in fact talk about elephants because he knew them so well, because he was trained as an elephant trainer. How, if he's an elephant trainer, if he's a bowman, if he's out in the field training for warfare, could he have been cloistered because his father was afraid that he would become a monk. Oh no, that story, actually the story that you've heard, doesn't even make sense. And everybody in the West will go around saying, "Oh, he abandoned his family." No, he didn't. Any way of abandoning the family, because his mother and father, they understood exactly why he had to leave. And his wife didn't like it, but guess what? His wife actually eventually became a nun. His mother, not the one who died, but her sister, the one who raised him, which was also Ananda's mother, that Ananda and the Buddha were raised together as brothers. And so that kind of story about the Buddha sneaking off and abandoning his pregnant wife just doesn't make sense at all.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But because of politics and because of warfare and because of a large piece of land being in dispute, and the fact that he didn't want to go to war for that. I mean, look at the prize fighter Cassius Clay, who became Muhammad Ali. He was a boxer, he was a fighter, right? He was drafted. He went to prison instead of going to Vietnam. Yeah, so in a way you could say that the Buddha had real balls to not go to war, that he went to almost the same thing as, uh, Cassius Clay, uh, Muhammad Ali. He did the same thing. He was making a big statement.

**Speaker C:** But when, when the Buddha— when, when the Buddha eventually went to Siddhartha, eventually became Buddha and, you know, years later, wasn't he an advisor to the king? And often they would go to war and he would advise the kings of the time, you know, whether they should go to war, whether they shouldn't go to war.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. That in fact the two kings of the time were King Pasenadi and King Bimbisara, and that he advised both of them. To never go to war with one another. Eventually the kingdoms were combined together. All right, okay. And so yes, he was big friends with kings. How could the Buddha have been friends with kings? Was because he was already from the royal family, which is a completely situation different than Jesus. That he was a nobody, but Siddha was the prince. He was the heir apparent, and his younger brother took over. Now, the Sakadagami clan, that was kind of close to the border of Nepal to where the Buddha was, was down in Bihar. He was in the vicinity of Bodhgaya and Varanasi and Ishtanya. If you get a map out, you'll can see this area, and he was probably 200 kilometers from the Sakyans, where he stayed. But I think that it was Rajgiri was one capital and Sarnath was the other capital, that even Varanasi wasn't the capital. Bimbisara had the capital at Sarnath, and King Pasenadi had the capital of Rajgiri, which was very close to Bodhgaya.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. And yes, he did deal with both of those kings. And in fact, there are 10 suttas in the area of the kings in the Mahayana Anicca where he's dealing with the kings, giving them advice, etc., like that. It's in— I think it's in the group of 80s because of the sutta number 86 is in the group of the kings about Angulimala, where Angulimala becomes a monk. And meanwhile, King Pasenadi with his warriors and his, let's say, Bhikkhunis, all armed to the teeth, were out looking for Anagami. And they came and approached the Buddha, and the Buddha looked directly at Anagami Mala, and then turned back and looked at King Pasenadi and says, "Do you see here whom you seek?" And Pasenadi probably had realized that the Buddha had already done King Pasenadi's job for him. Of rehabilitating. And so he and his warriors left. No, we don't find whom we seek here. So he was great friends with the kings. Yeah, highly respected. They came to visit him often. There's actually another story that we can do since we're into storytelling now is that the son of King Bimbisara actually killed his father in order to take over the throne, and it bothered him greatly. And so he came and actually converted to becoming a follower of the Buddha himself. This, this sutra, by the way, is in the Dhammarato number 2. I forgot the guy's name. It starts with the letter A, but came to be Miskara's son. First killed his father and then with remorse converted to the teachings of the Buddha. So even with that kind of thing, he still has that sort of influence over the royalty. Okay, but anyway, you were about to ask an original question. What was your original question?

**Speaker C:** Oh, the original, uh, the original question was— gosh, I can't even remember what it was now. Oh yeah, so it was, um, he— it seemed to me that the Buddha had, had removed himself from society. He didn't want to be the king. He didn't want to live in society. He was— he followed, you know, he followed these teachers to try and search for, you know, the meaning of life. Didn't, you know, he got— he got to some sort of level, and at the end, you know, he achieved enlightenment, and he realized, you know, everything's okay, you know, as it is. So out of all that, out of all those years of living, he came to the conclusion, you know, it seemed like he just wanted to be in seclusion and not be part of society, right?

**Speaker B:** That in fact, that's what the whole Sangha is all about, is to get away from society as best you can. There's further with that. Not only did they go off and live in the woods alone and stay together, but he had many, many, maybe 10 times as many followers who were laypeople or householders than he did with the ones who became monks. First off, he attracted all of the recluses and all of the ones who were already seeking enlightenment. Many of them were part of the Jains, others were practicing meditation. I mean, India has always been kind of a religious nuthouse, and there was a lot of them that were already doing that kind of stuff, and so they came to the Buddha. There was also the Sudras, the low class, who did not have anything at all. They didn't have any land, they didn't have— so the lower classes were also highly attracted to the Buddha because he did not have a caste system. But there was also a great deal of a number of people who did become students of the Buddha who were householders, landholders, they were merchants, they were farmers. This group of people, they remained farmers and householders, but they changed their whole way of living. That you can imagine that a householder who is required, I mean, let us say that he's got hundreds of acres of land, he's got hundreds of people working for him, if he became a monk, look how many people are going to be out of work, look how much land is going to get fallow, or whatever like that. And so these guys would stay in their homes, but they would give all of the household duties and the homeowner duties and the farming duties to the wife and let her take over. This is part of the reason why Thai society is so matriarchal. It's because the Thai people also kind of practice this, that a man's job is to get married and help his wife run the family business that she runs, and his job is to sit around and say, yes ma'am. That's exactly how I live my life here. You can see, I mean, Michael and several others know that. You know what I'm talking about, Michael? It's just let the women run the— run it. Pam wants to build a house, okay, build it. That's what you want to do. So if every guy that's, that's, uh, that listens to me here that has a wife and has a family, your life will be a whole lot better off if you stop being the boss, stop being the man of the house, and just start being someone there who has nothing to do other than to support the wife, to love her, to take care of her, to nurture her, to give her the love and attention and affection that she needs so she can go out and run the world. Ah, Dietrich, you turned your camera back on for that one. And so that's what so many of the men did. Even though they didn't take on the robes because they didn't have the, let us say, the permission or the ability to do that. But they still sat on their front porch and lived the life of a monk and just abandoned everything and let the wife take care of all the business. There's actually a story about this in India. It comes from a book that I read The star of the book is a whole lot of stories, is called Mullah Nasruddin. He was a mullah, he was Muslim, and there's a whole lot of stories in there about how he lived his life. And one of them was, is that he was walking across the street in the same way every day at about the same time. And so the policeman, the officer, he comes up to the mullah and says, where are you going? You keep going out every day at the same time. Where are you going? And he says, I don't know. And that pissed the Anagami— I mean, the cop. They get angry easy. And so he arrested him and took him to the jail because he was being flippant. He didn't know where he was going. And as soon as he got locked up, he mentioned to the policeman, see, I told you I didn't know where I was going. So, back to the main story then, another group of people come to the Mullah Nasruddin and say, "Well, what do you do?" And he says, "Oh, I do all the really important things." And they say, "Well, what's so important that you do?" And he says, "Well, I ponder whether God exists." I ponder what is right and what is wrong. I ponder about how to have human happiness, and I do that kind of stuff. And they says, well, what do you mean that you do only important stuff? What is all the unimportant stuff? And he says, oh, well, my wife takes care of all the unimportant stuff. And this is— what is that? And this is Oh, well, she decides what house we live in, what kind of transportation we have, she takes care of where the children go to school, and what clothes they wear, and how the money is spent, and what food we eat, and all of that kind of stuff. She takes care of all the really unimportant stuff. And so, this is what I would invite you all to consider, is only do the really important stuff, like get your mind straightened out, find your happiness, get your satisfaction going, get your success in life, and leave your wife with all of the unimportant stuff to do, like where you live and what food you eat and what clothes you wear. And where you go, everything like where you go and what you do and all of that kind of stuff, let the wife take care of that. Okay, so this story that I'm telling you from Nasrudin and the teaching of the Buddha is the same. It's the way of freedom that even if you're a householder, This is the freedom of a householder. And so I've decided to teach that today because it's really important in that sense, Dietrich, of what they call letting go. Now, the word letting go actually is a problem word. It's highly involved with Western Buddhism, but it's actually a mistake. Let's look at what letting go means. So I'll do this. You can see that I've got a thing in my hand here. Now I can say let it go, and if I let it go like this, it'll fall, right? But what if I'm holding it like this and I let it go? There it is. It's still there. I've let it go and it didn't move. All right. This is the quality of Right Noble Effort. You can't just let go of stuff, you've got to throw it out. You've got to actually take the effort to make a change. So, if the mind has an unwholesome thought, you have to actually take the effort to throw it out, to change it. If you have an unwholesome attitude, "Oh, poor me, oh, they're 'Bothering me,' or 'The IRS is on my back,' or 'The bank is on my back,' or this, that, and the other thing is the way that we feel. This is basically the attitude of a victim. And we cannot just let go of the attitude of a victim, because it's going to stay. You actually have to actively change your attitude from being a victim into being a winner. You actually have to take the effort to make that change in your attitude, to gladden the mind, to say to yourself, "I can handle this." When you see yourself saying, "Poor me," you can say, "Wait a minute, I'm not poor, I can handle anything." Ivan, you got your hand up. [Speaker:IVAN] Yes, I was thinking. Sometimes if we find ourselves in difficult situations, and I think like people expect things to get better, isn't that— if you are expecting things to get better, is that a victim mindset? Like, is it? Yeah. Things, by the way, are not going to get better. The only thing that you can get better is your attitude about the things. Yes, the things are just— are things don't get better or worse. That's your attitude. Your attitude gets better or worse. Can you change your attitude? Because you can't change the things, you can't change the world. But what you can do is you can change your own mind, you can change your behavior, you can change the way you think, you can change your own attitude. You can put a smile on your face, but you can't change other people. But they can change themselves if you help them by giving them a smile. And if you smile at them, they'll smile back. I see it happening right here. All I did was smile, and here, look at all the smiles. Okay, but you chose to do that. I didn't do it to you. You did that all by yourself. So that's the thing. Can you change your attitude? It's not a matter of letting go. Here's an example that I had yesterday. You've heard of people being slaves or being in a ball and chain, like at prisons, and they call it shackles. Maybe it's a ball with a chain and it's got an ankle bracelet made of steel. Or a cast iron or whatever. Imagine that you get that ball of chain free. What are you going to do if that— if that— if that shackle is broken right here? Are you going to still leave it around your ankle, or are you going to remove it? Are you going to get up and run away from that shackle? Are you going to leave that ball and chain? Are you going to go dance Or are you going to leave that shackle and that ball of chain right there? That's the problem with letting go, is because if you let go of something, it ain't leaving. You got to leave it. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, I just— I mean, yeah, I agree, you know, the making a smile, you know, putting on a smile can make a huge difference to your day and other people's day. But what happens in the event you're being attacked or you're being bullied? You have to— there are times when you have to fight back. A smile's not going to cut it.

**Speaker B:** Well, Uh, give me an example.

**Speaker C:** Well, you know, like, um, bullying at school or kids at school. You know, when I, when I was at school, we had, you know, I recall situations where I was being attacked and I had to fight back.

**Speaker B:** No, you don't. No, you don't have to fight back. You can, you can leave if you want. Here's the point: it depends upon whether you are so stupid as to get trapped Or are you wise enough to keep your distance? Because what you're talking about, you have to fight back, is because they're already ganged up on you because of your own stupidity. You got yourself into that mess. So let me give you an example. The 14-year-old boy is standing or walking down the hallway, and down at the end of the hall— or not the end of the hall, but the passageway— Around the corner comes the bully with his two friends. And what is the boy, the 14-year-old boy, going to do? Freeze in fear. And here comes the bully. And so naturally, the bully is going to pick on him because he's exhibiting fear. It would be quite well for that guy if he sees that bully, the first thing that he wants to do is to start walking very fast right past that bully. And if the bully tries to stop him and says, hold on a second, can you— all you have to do is say, gotta go, I'm in a hurry. If you want to talk to me, come with me, and just leave. Leave before the bullies get close enough to you to lay hands on you. Make yourself scarce. Slip out the back, Jack. Make a new plan, Stan. Don't be coy, Roy, just set yourself free. Hop on the bus, Gus, don't make a fuss. This is the way to handle things, is just get out of town before the fireworks happen. But that takes wisdom. That takes— you got to see what's coming so that you can do something about it. And the right thing to do in circumstances like that is to get away. Leave. Don't put yourself into a dangerous situation. Don't get trapped by the bullies. They'll surround you if you stand in fear. They'll surround you. But it's hard to surround somebody that's at a gallop. So just take a hike. I've got one student that's actually going through a divorce now. Finally, he's pulled the plug on it. And the point that he is making is, is that he was being abused and his response was what I would tell him to do. Anytime that she's going to give you a hard time and she starts yelling or arguing or going to hurt the dog or whatever, the right thing to do is to get out. When she calls you on your phone, turn the phone off. Be off, be away, go into seclusion. This is teaching of the Buddha. And another example of that is the Buddhist says that there are four kinds of places where you want to avoid, kind of big places like the neighborhood that you live in. And that is if there is pestilence, if people are sick, if there is a flood, if there is a drought, or Anagami, lack of food, and most importantly, if it is a war zone, the right thing for the monks to do is to leave the area. OK, so this is the way that the Buddha handles things, and that is to take a hike. I've got another story about that. You've heard of when the going gets tough, the tough get going. That's what you're talking about. When the going gets tough, you got a tough back, right? But there's another group, they call them the barders, the ones who are the traveling musicians. And so when the going gets tough, the bard go drinking. But for the Buddha, when the going gets tough, he just takes a hike. So that's the answer to that. If you can get away from whatever trouble there is because you can see the trouble coming before it gets there, then you're home free. Become the champion. Wow, I got out of that one. But that takes some wisdom. It takes that you've got to see the danger coming. But when you see the danger at a distance, there's no reason to fear. It's when the danger gets close that people can become afraid. That's when the self-preservation instinct arises, is when the danger is close by. So wisdom means that you can see the danger at a distance so that it does not get close, and then you remain safe and secure is because you stay at a distance from that danger. Take a hike, hop on the bus, drop off the key, and make yourself free. Does that make sense, Ross?

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, yeah, it does, it does. I mean, I was just I was just thinking, you know, there are certain situations in life where these events happen, whether you're young or old. And, you know, yeah, if it's easy just to avoid them and stay away from them, fantastic. For some people, you know, they get cornered and it's not so easy.

**Speaker B:** So they got cornered because they weren't watching the corners. They got cornered because they weren't watching the walls close in. You know, what we're talking about right now goes back to the story about— you were mentioning that the Buddha left. Well, that's exactly what he did. When the going got tough, or before the going got tough, he got going. He took a hike. And he did it in a way to where it was calm and easy and all of that. He just left. That's what we would do when you're in any bad situation, is just leave. And if you do that, over time you will spread Buddhism all over the place. But the right thing to do is to find a place that you are safe and secure. Do it wisely and keep yourself safe and free. Don't go picking a fight with the bullies. Don't make yourself even available to the bullies, for them to pick a fight with you. Keep your distance. Does anybody have any questions about this? Does anybody actually have any troubles or questions or arguments or whatever? Because this is a profound way of changing the way you live. Because our whole society means that you've got to stand up for yourself. How many of you heard that? You've got to be tough, you've got to stand up for yourself, right? That's a stupid thing to do. That's what causes all the conflict in the world, is because one country stands up against another. The Buddha knew that was wrong even before he became a Buddha. That's why he voted against going to war. War against the other group. And that's why he wouldn't go with them, even though he had pledged his loyalty to them. He wouldn't go with it. So this is what I would advise for you to do, is to be wise enough to get out of the way. So let's have a little practical way of thinking about that. Let us say that you're on Reddit and somebody is criticizing what you just posted. What do you do about that? What do you do about the comments on YouTube or wherever, and they disagree with what you've said? How many of you feel bad about that and then post back? What's actually the right thing to do?

**Speaker A:** No response.

**Speaker B:** Huh? Put down that phone, right? Set it down. Put it away. Get away from it. And when you see danger in an area like on Reddit, don't go to Reddit anymore. Stay away from the dangers. Whatever ticks you off take a hike.

**Speaker A:** Can I have a question about that?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so we're now in a situation where there's a lot of war zones and things, and people have strong opinions about that.

**Speaker B:** Stay out of your own strong opinions. Don't have opinions, but see that, for instance, don't have an opinion about what's in Gaza. Don't go there. Don't go to Gaza. It's a war zone, right? Which means don't even go there with your own mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but if you want to live wisely, like in a way like see the danger coming and avoid it. And more closer by, like the war, like Russia invading Ukraine. There are several, well, people are all making scenarios about what is going to happen.

**Speaker B:** We don't know what's going to happen.

**Speaker A:** No, I know, but there's things like what would be wise just to say, okay, let them fight it and let them have it, or Are you going.

**Speaker B:** To go try to break it up? I can see Deidre right now in her little tank going up to the troops and, and let's break this up, folks. You can't stop people from going to war. It may not turn out the way that you want it to, so stop wanting it to turn out in a certain way.

**Speaker A:** I don't want Russia to invade Europe up to Holland, if you don't mind.

**Speaker B:** That's something like— But you're not going to do anything about it, are you? You're not going to get in your little tank and stop Putin.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm going to take a hike then.

**Speaker B:** Right. But what you can do when Putin invades The Netherlands, what can you do? Take a hike. That's what millions and millions of people have done. Millions have left the Ukraine, millions have left Russia.

**Speaker A:** I've had them in my house, people from Ukraine.

**Speaker B:** Well, now you got some traveling buddies, so when Putin comes, you can pack up all your bags and Take off, go find someplace else that's not at war. Stay away from war. When two people are arguing in a bar, get out of the bar.

**Speaker A:** Do you know the expression, "Live your life like someone left the fence open"?

**Speaker B:** I would say, live your life like there was never a fence anywhere except in your thought. You thought that there was a fence, and there's no fence.

**Speaker A:** Good one. Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that not only can you leave, but you can leave in almost every direction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** At least the four corners, but the other two, the six directions. Going up and going down, that takes another discussion. But as far as the directions go, north, south, east, west, choose one and take it and stay away from danger. That's one of the reasons why the Buddha recommends seclusion, and he gives the story about the log in the bog. That when a log is in a bog, you cannot set it on fire. It's waterlogged. It's, you know, so what happens when you take it out of the bog, when you take it out of the swamp and put it on the shore, is still waterlogged. But over time, both gravity and the sunlight will get the log dried out enough so that you can set it on fire. Okay, so what we mean by that is being waterlogged because we live in the swamp of the world. If we get out of the world, then we've got to drain the rest of the stuff that we've got in our mind. But over time— time, you've heard time heals all wounds? No, what really is going on is memory is short. And when you get out of the danger, you'll forget all about it. Don't hold a grudge against people. I'm not into forgiveness. I'm into forget it. Don't forgive, because that just remembers. Oh, they did me wrong, but it's okay. No, it's not okay. What's really not okay is that you remember and hold that grudge, that you have to forgive them. All right, well, it's been a long time. We've really enjoyed this. We never really did get around to funerals. I was going to chant funerals, uh, chants and all of that kind of stuff when I thought about starting this call, but we didn't go in that direction. We went in the direction of the life of the Buddha. And we wind up with this one important way. So I'll end it off like this: the ultimate way of checking out and not have any more troubles is by going down, dying. Let it go in the sense of you're going to croak anyway, it's only a matter of timing. It's only a matter of time, so be ready. Be ready to go. You're going to die. Be ready for it, because that's the ultimate checkout. The body may get old, it may be decrepit, it may be broken. I had a chiropractor once told me that it's very common that people fall and break their hips and then they're out of it for the rest of their lives. And he says that's not true at all. He says normally they break their hip and then they fall. They don't fall and break their hip on the landing. They broke their hip just by walking. Your body is going to get old, it's going to get decrepit, you're going to get old, you're going to get sick, and you're going to die. And if you're lucky, it happens in that order. If you're not lucky, you die before you get old. So consider yourself lucky when you get really, really old. But with old age comes sickness. Can you handle the sickness? Because someday you're going to get so sick you can't handle it anymore. There's a war inside your own body. Let's take a hike. Let's die. It's going to happen. And yet so many people, because of this self-preservation instinct happening ignorantly, they cling to life when the better thing to do is to let go. Just say, oh well, I've had enough today. Bye-bye, cruel world, I'm out of here. So be ready for that. I mean, if you can handle your own death happily, you can handle anything that ever happens to you happily. So plan on happily handling your death. Plan on being happy, happy that you're finally out of here, that the game is over. The war is done. The battle is fit. And when you can check out happily, that means that you can check out of any other kind of conflict happily. Let it go. Throw it out. So let's do that with this call. Let's happily end this thing. I've had about as much joy as I can stand. Does anybody have any last remarks? Boy, you guys have been quiet on this call. Thomas, what do you think? Not much to think, just okayness and calmness. It was really pleasant listening to this. Good one. How about you? Ross number 2.

**Speaker C:** Um, I'm just thinking I'm hungry.

**Speaker B:** I want to get some food. All right, so go for it. This call has gotten old. Let's let it die. Ross number 1, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** Uh, we're all gonna die, so just chill out, relax.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just chill out, just relax. Alex, how about you? I'm okay, I'm okay. I've enjoyed the meeting very much and death is very familiar to me, so. I work in a hospital ward, so, and I'm working tonight. So I hope not too many people die, so I don't have to, I don't need to have a lot of work tonight. Yeah, get them a joyful kickoff. Send them off. That's right, that's right. Don't be miserable because your friends and family and patients and all die. Be happy that now you don't have to take care of them anymore. Never, never, never.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's obvious that they go.

**Speaker B:** Oh, we're supposed to be sad and unhappy because of death. And death, it just means that it's over. Yeah, we can take a hike. Yeah, exactly. So Ivan, do you have any final words? Uh, yeah, yeah, I just realized that it sounds like joyfully being happy handling tasks is just the easier way to go about literally anything. Um, I just thinking about that. How about you, Michael? Do you have any final words to say? Satisfied that things are coming to an end. And, uh, everyone go, uh, subscribe to our YouTube channel after this. Yeah, Michael made some nice changes to the YouTube channel. I don't know if anybody's been on recently. We're also continuing to work on the website too, so go check that out. All right guys, David, do you have any last words? Uh, ready to happily check out anytime. All right, well let's do it then. Let's pull that chain. Let's drop that bomb. We'll see you all. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk led by Dhammarato:

### **Core Theme: Wise vs. Ignorant Attachment and the Art of "Taking a Hike"**

The talk, a casual Sangha discussion, revolved around a question about attachment and letting go. Dhammarato used this to explore the Buddha's practical teachings on happiness and freedom.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Attachment is Not Inherently Bad:** Dhammarato clarified that attachment itself isn't the root of suffering (*dukkha*). The cause is *ignorant* attachment—clinging based on confusion and dislike. *Wise* attachment (e.g., to family, practiced with kindness) brings joy. The fundamental, instinctual attachment is the "self-preservation instinct" to stay alive.

2.  **The Real Cause of Suffering:** Suffering arises from our ignorant reactions of liking, disliking, and confusion about our feelings. We desperately seek answers and certainty because we "don't like not knowing." This thirst for knowledge, even wrong knowledge, drives much of our anxiety (e.g., worrying about elections, polls, or the future).

3.  **The Practice is Internal & Simple:** True practice isn't about analyzing the external world but about **directly observing and adjusting our internal state**. Using the *Satipatthana* framework, we can:
    *   Change unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones.
    *   Transform fear into feelings of safety and comfort.
    *   Shift our attitude from being a **victim** of circumstances to being a **winner** who can handle anything.

4.  **"Letting Go" is Active, Not Passive:** The common idea of "letting go" is misleading. It's not a passive release but an **active effort of change and removal**. You must consciously discard unwholesome states (like a victim mindset) and replace them with wholesome ones (a confident, capable mindset). It's like removing a broken shackle from your ankle, not just unlocking it.

5.  **The Supreme Strategy: "Take a Hike":** A major practical teaching was the strategy of **wise avoidance**. When you see conflict, danger, or "unwholesome" situations brewing—whether in person, online, or even in your own mind—the enlightened response is to **leave**. Don't fight, don't engage, don't "stand up for yourself" in a confrontational way. See trouble at a distance and remove yourself. This mirrors the Buddha's own departure from his clan to avoid war.

6.  **Reinterpreting the Buddha's Life:** Dhammarato challenged the romanticized story of Prince Siddhartha abandoning his palace out of spiritual curiosity. He presented a historical view: Siddhartha, a skilled statesman and warrior, left because he refused to vote for and participate in a war over land, making him an outcast from his own clan. His departure was a political and ethical act of non-violence.

7.  **The Ultimate "Checkout":** The talk concluded by applying this logic to the greatest attachment: life itself. The ultimate practice of "taking a hike" is to be prepared to die happily. By accepting and being at peace with the inevitable end of the body, you can handle any other loss or conflict in life with equanimity.

**Overall Message:** The path to freedom isn't about destroying natural instincts or relationships, but about practicing them with wisdom. It involves actively cultivating a healthy internal state, disengaging from sources of conflict before they ensnare you, and changing your attitude from one of fear and victimhood to one of confidence and capability. The goal is to live—and die—with a happy, unburdened mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, the primary **metaphors and stories** used are:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Puppy Instinct:** Used to illustrate the deep, biological basis of attachment. Newborn puppies instinctively crawl to find their mother to nurse, symbolizing how our need for security, nurturing, and belonging is hardwired into our nature (the self-preservation and nesting instincts).
2.  **The Broken Cell Phone:** Represents "ignorant attachment." The intense distress someone feels when they break their phone is compared to feeling like a part of *themselves* is dying, showing how we mistakenly identify with external objects.
3.  **The Shackle and Ball & Chain:** Illustrates the difference between passive "letting go" and active effort. If the chain is broken, you still have to actively remove the shackle from your ankle and walk away. You can't just "let it go" and have it disappear; you must consciously leave it behind.
4.  **The Log in the Bog:** Borrowed from Buddhist scripture, this metaphor describes the mind. A waterlogged log (the mind soaked in worldly concerns) can't catch fire (achieve insight). You must first pull it out of the bog (seclusion/withdrawal) and let it dry out (through practice and time) before it can ignite.
5.  **The Dinner Plate:** A dropped dinner plate that ruins a meal symbolizes how we can choose our attitude. The family is upset, but the dog is happy. We can choose to shift perspective and find humor or acceptance instead of defaulting to frustration.
6.  **The Fence:** In response to the saying "live your life like someone left the fence open," the speaker reframes it: "live your life like there was never a fence anywhere except in your thought." This metaphor challenges perceived limitations and barriers, suggesting they are mental constructs.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha's Departure (Revised History):** The speaker challenges the common religious narrative. He tells a story where Prince Siddhartha leaves his palace not out of spiritual curiosity, but as a political protest. He refuses to go to war over a land dispute, is outvoted by his clan, and chooses exile over participation in violence. This frames his "renunciation" as an act of wise avoidance of conflict and adherence to principle.
2.  **The Psychology Institute Clique:** A personal story from the speaker's time studying psychology. When members of a group were asked to secretly write down who they thought the "insiders" were, the results were surprising and inconsistent. This story illustrates the **illusion of "in-groups"** and how much mental suffering is based on our ignorant perceptions of social belonging.
3.  **Mullah Nasruddin Tales:** Two stories about the wise fool Nasruddin are used:
    *   **The Unimportant Stuff:** Nasruddin says he ponders important questions (like God's existence), while his wife handles all the "unimportant" stuff—managing the home, finances, food, etc. This story humorously advocates for focusing on internal mental work (the "important") and relinquishing obsessive control over external life details (the "unimportant").
    *   **"I Don't Know":** Nasruddin is arrested for giving a flippant answer ("I don't know") when asked where he is going daily. Once jailed, he points out this proves he was right. This underscores the theme of being comfortable with **not knowing** and the trouble that comes from demanding certainty.
4.  **The Bullied Teenager:** A hypothetical scenario of a teenager seeing bullies in a school hallway. The story is used to teach the principle of **"taking a hike"**—seeing danger at a distance and wisely avoiding it by leaving the situation before it escalates, rather than "standing your ground."
5.  **The 2024 U.S. Election & Polls:** Used as a modern, relatable example of our deep **aversion to "not knowing."** The anxiety over polls and predictions illustrates how we crave certainty about the future, even when it's impossible, and how this craving creates mental suffering.

### **Central Themes These Devices Support:**
*   **Wise vs. Ignorant Attachment:** Instincts and attachments aren't inherently bad; it's how we use them.
*   **The Source of Suffering:** Not attachment itself, but our **likes, dislikes, and confusion** rooted in ignorance.
*   **Active Change vs. Passive Letting Go:** Happiness requires actively changing thoughts and attitudes, not just passively releasing them.
*   **Withdrawal as Wisdom:** Often, the wisest action is to strategically avoid conflict and harmful situations ("take a hike").
*   **Comfort with Not Knowing:** A key to peace is accepting uncertainty about the future, others' opinions, and external events.
*   **The Ultimate "Letting Go":** Preparing for one's own death with acceptance is the final practice in non-attachment.
