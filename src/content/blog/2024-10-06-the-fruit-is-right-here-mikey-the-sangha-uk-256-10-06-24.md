### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, hello, this is the Sangha UK, and today is October 6th, Sunday, and we're going to be talking about Noble Speech versus Ordinary Speech. We're also going to be talking about the Realm of the Deathless and Is there any value in thinking about how our actions affect the future versus thinking about what are our actions doing right now? So we'll go ahead and start with the concept of here and now, and what does that even mean? And what is the current reality that we're in? Right. So the first thing to note is that when we're thinking about the past or we're thinking about the future, these are always, always, always, always conceptual thoughts that we're having. So even if one has the thought, I know who's going to win the presidential election. And they think, oh yes, I think Trump's going to win, or Kamala is going to win, or some third party is going to come take it, right? Even if that thought ends up being correct and true, it is still a concept. It's still conceptual, it's still made up. And that is the thing to recognize, is that you're making up these concepts in your mind. And when you're making them up is here and now, essentially. And so this idea of thinking about the here and now, looking at your actions in the here and now, bringing yourself back to the here and now, it's really something that you already are in. You already are right here, right now. Right? When we talk about reminding ourselves to come back to the here and now, you're always in the here and now, in a sort of way. But these reminders are to help facilitate the practice to develop the qualities of the mind and to develop Anapanasati, to develop friendliness, and to develop wholesome thoughts. Because if we're always thinking about things that are outside of our realm of control, then we're not giving attention to things that are within our control right now. And the truth is, is that you can make a change right now. And so you had brought up the idea, Diedre, of, well, what about how are our actions going to affect the future? And the point isn't to just do actions that are going to negatively affect the future, but to do actions that we know are wholesome right now in this present moment, because that's the only thing that we can have some bit of accuracy on judging, basically. It's like, is this thought wholesome and worthwhile right now? Is this true right now? Is basically what we're asking. And if we're If we're getting stuck thinking about the future and thinking about, okay, well, you know, this thing that I'm doing right now, such as, oh, I'm just taking it easy, I'm just taking a break, oh, that's going to prevent me from getting some nice job in the future, that's going to prevent me from, you know, doing something with my life that I need to do. That is actually what is preventing the mind itself from calming down, chilling out, taking it easy, and being in a wholesome state. And what I like to tell people is that if you want to be happy in the future, if you want to be at peace in the future, if you want to be calm in the future, the best way to practice that is to do it right now. Because we don't know how our actions are going to shape the future. We can take guesses again at it, right? And we can conceptualize, we can even get quite good at conceptualizing, right? You know, there's these people that get paid a lot of money to predict the election accurately, but then every once in a while they get it wrong. But that's just the way the world is, is things are always changing in such a way that you can't always predict how things are going to go. And there's another point that I'd like to make about the here and now, which is that even In our current reality, we have a delayed response. Dhammarato, of course, loves to talk about this, is that, you know, cats have a very fast reaction time compared to humans. You know, if a snake is attacking a cat, the cat will swap it out of the air and be able to handle that. Whereas a human is much slower to react. And, you know, we can look at this in a way it's like when you get like cut on your finger, you don't feel that cut immediately. First, it goes to your nerves, and then it travels up through your nerves and then through your spinal cord and into your brain. And then you have a reaction to it. So when we talk about being in the here and now, it's really about being in the mind and what the mind is experiencing. It's not actually being with that finger, with where the cut is happening, right? It's about being with where the cut is happening up here. Right. You know, this idea of being exactly here where everything that this body is experiencing, that's almost an extreme. So that's why we bring it to the mind. Because, you know, different people have different reaction times. Pilots, I've heard, have quite fast reaction times. But anyways, Dietrich, you have your hand up. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, quite slow opening the mic. I'm a human. Yeah, I was wondering, because if you want to be happy in the future, be happy right now. If you want to have peace in the future, obtain peace right now. So it's more like, you know, I'm finding sometimes a hard time to find the discipline to meditate every day or at least several times a week. So what I sometimes do is I plan. I plan in the week, okay, on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday. I go to yoga on Thursday, then I do— so like I planned this. So this is something like an action. The planning is an action right here, right now. And it makes me like reminding myself during the week that this is the path I want to go. I mean, this is what I— heedfulness. I want to do this. I want to move on. What about those actions right here, right now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. So you make an excellent point, is that we can still make plans. You can break that down, though, is how you make the plan. You know, are you having the plan, oh, I'm going to go get married? Or are you having the plan, oh, I'm gonna go talk to that girl over there or that guy? Or are you already skipping to the marriage thoughts in your head, these sort of daydreams, right? Are you having the plan, oh, I'm gonna go to the beach? Or are you having the plan, oh, I'm just gonna go out? Don't necessarily have to go to the beach, right? So cutting up our time like this and recognizing that we can train the mind to not be so involved with planning things and more so be more open and adjusting to the way things are. Because on our way to the beach, it may start to rain. And then we decide that we want to come home. But anyways, Luke, you have your hand up, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Thanks, Mikey. Yeah, I was just wondering, like, so are we discounting the idea of Kamma here? Are we saying we're like, let's say I think I'm going to cook for the monastics tomorrow take it to the monastery, offer it, that's going to bring me good results. I don't know what, but yeah, if I believe in doing good deeds are going to bring me good results, then I think planning for the future is going to bring me— like, the idea of doing that in the present moment, it brings me joy.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, but when does it bring you the results? It brings you the results right now when you're planning to make meal and take it to the monks, that's when you're happiest.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, good point.

**Speaker A:** When you're thinking about it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's a good point. So that's almost like the results of the Kamma right there, rather than— well, we don't know what's going to happen in the future, right?

**Speaker A:** So you may take the food to the monk and it ends up the monk is allergic to whatever you fed them and they fall over on the floor and now you feel terrible.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, good point. I'm not the best cook in the world, so yeah, that's very possible. Yeah, good. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thanks.

**Speaker A:** Sure. So yeah, we can't ever know. And this is actually a good time to bring up the idea of perfection. This is actually a word I almost never hear Dhammarato use. But you'll hear some other Bhikkhus and people use it every once in a while as this idea that, you know, we don't have to be perfect. We talk about Right Noble Speech, Right Noble Action, Right Noble Thoughts, not perfect. You don't have to have a perfect practice. And I'm sure you've heard that saying before is practice makes perfect. But there's never been a perfect practitioner. Not even the Buddha was perfect in his practice. But then there is— and we're actually dipping into the topic of noble language here too— there is the way a noble might use the word perfect. You know, when a noble says, "Ah, everything's perfect right now, just the way that it is," that's basically the same as saying, "Everything's okay, everything's just fine." There's not this seeking, this wanting for things to be different than how they are. And that's what creates a sort of perfection in the mind. Ajahn Samadhi He tells the story that, you know, he used to tell people, "I try to tell them that they're perfect and nobody believes me." But this can create a lot of dissatisfaction in the mind. Is that when we think there's something wrong with us, right, where there's this judgment. And so I'm not necessarily saying to use the word perfect in your vocabulary, but to play around with your vocabulary, to play around with the words that you're using, and see it as a fun game. Because you can't have perfect speech And, you know, even speaking on the Dharma, about the Dharma, we're already straying a bit from the Dharma because the Dharma has qualities that can't be described, that can't be thought up, that can't be concocted. It is the unconcocted. And when we're talking about the realm of the deathless, the Buddha said to the Bhikkhus, you do not want to be reborn, stop being reborn. And the way Dhammarato puts it is that means right now, stop being reborn right now. And this is what it means to be deathless, is that when you're no longer born, there's no death. There's— because whatever was born dies, and then that's it. Thich Nhat Hanh put it like, a cloud never dies. This is the kind of noble language that Thich Nhat Hanh would use, the very poetic, we're all clouds. And then you have some people that take it too far and say, oh, the body is a cloud of sensations. So what does it mean to be like a cloud that never dies? It means that there's no clinging to what's happening. There's no wanting for things to be different. There's no dissatisfaction that the cloud turns into rain. Yeah, your body will die, it'll get sick, it'll grow old, but it's not going to disappear, at least not as far as we know. It'll turn into something else. New bodies, in fact. You came from stars, you may as well go that way too. Who knows? I don't.

**Speaker B:** Maybe you turn into a cloud.

**Speaker A:** I have a friend who was asking about contemplation of death recently. And yeah, I mean, we're covered in dead stuff, dead skin all over us, dead hair, dead bacteria inside of us. Dead cells. And there's actually great benefit to death, right? Cancer is when cells have the mechanism to die turned off, and they just keep reproducing and reproducing and reproducing, and it creates a tumor. Oh, it's so wonderful that people die, but it's the fact that they don't enjoy it that brings them suffering or dissatisfaction. That's the noble term, right?

**Speaker D:** But we're not supposed to help them die though. I mean, we're not supposed to say, well, I'm going to do you a favor and I'll just kill them.

**Speaker A:** Sure. Yeah. Yeah. We don't have to kill anybody. They'll die just fine on their own. Oh, yeah. What the Buddha says, stop being reborn. Die now! But when talking about death, we're talking about dying in the mind, not the body. We're not talking about cutting up the body like how we cut the finger. We're saying to see this as always changing, out of your control, not you. Being able to recognize this and see this clearly is what brings one to the realm of the deathless. And it's in a way a realm that one can, we can say, go in and out of, or see in and out of. Sometimes we cling quite heavily to the body. But when we see clearly, we don't. And the easiest way to develop that seeing is to practice it here and now. Yeah, go ahead, Diji.

**Speaker B:** How would you define death then, or deathless? Is it like having no thoughts, or is just no clinging, no resistance? Just being.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not necessarily having no thoughts. It's more so not seeing you in the thought. You know, so we can break it down on a scientific level if we want to and say, oh, the thought is just a chemical reaction. Or we can break it down on another level and say, oh, the thought is just an old habit passed down in one way or another from society or our parents. I mean, even the words that we're using, the language that we're speaking, we didn't create any of this. But putting the 'you' in there, that's what puts the fear in there, saying that if this thought dies, then I'm dead. There's also kind of a recognition that there's more than one way to see it. And this is sort of the Noble View, is that There is no solid defined view. And a noble can sort of see from many views, or can not be bothered by any views, we can say.

**Speaker B:** So would you say that being as fluid as you can be in your views or in your opinions or in your viewpoints or whatever, how malleable you are in there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so basically use words and use language that open things up for you. This actually makes life more enjoyable and in a way more exciting. When we say, oh, I'm going to go to the beach and we tell our husband our wife going to the beach and then we decide we're not going to go to the beach and we get back, now we have to explain to them why we didn't go to the beach.

**Speaker D:** As far as planning, right, like sometimes if you don't plan right, say you're going in the wilderness and you didn't bring the warm clothes, you forgot your canoe paddle, then the future could be affected and suffering. What appears to be suffering.

**Speaker A:** Now, the suffering only comes, or the dissatisfaction only comes in the mind. It actually doesn't come from not having things. The dissatisfaction doesn't come from the body dying. The dissatisfaction when the body dies is actually wanting the body to keep living. Whenever it's ready to go.

**Speaker D:** Or if you want to help people but you can't help them because you're going to cease to exist in this particular realm.

**Speaker A:** Right? So stop wanting to help people.

**Speaker D:** Sometimes people seem like they need help, but I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, even if people need help, wanting to help them doesn't help them. This is called taking the middleman out, right? Again, this is going back to our topic of what is noble speech. It's taking these middlemen out, cutting things out that we keep putting in. You say, oh, I'm going to go to the beach, just say, oh, I'm going to go out. And you can even cut that out too and say, not sure where I'm going. I don't even know if I'm going yet. The question I had is, yeah, go ahead, Lars.

**Speaker D:** Like noble speech doesn't always seem to include like avoiding profanity or something like that. I know some people swear occasionally, some people may all the time, not necessarily Buddhists, but I don't know, just something I was thinking about.

**Speaker A:** Well, you know, it's up to each individual. Some, you know, a noble may hear the word shit and not hear anything harsh about that. You know, it's just a word at the end of the day. All words have these weird histories and origins, and who knows how that got there. One word may be offensive to another person and completely inoffensive to someone else, you know.

**Speaker D:** It's just a word. Yeah, words. Yeah, but then like noble speech is— is like speech is important.

**Speaker A:** Like, well, what's important is, uh, to practice the Dhamma. And to be friendly with one another. This is actually what helps create noble speech. Because when we recognize, oh, pointing back to the Dharma over and over and over again for ourselves and for others, this inspires confidence that, oh, yes, I can change my speech and speak in a more noble fashion. Whether that means, yeah, you know, it may mean removing profanities. It may mean removing things that we tend to say but not think much of, right? Buddhadasa would talk about how An Noble can say things like 'I' and 'you,' but in their mind not mean it, not see any significance there, just recognize it as being another tool in the toolbox, a cultural norm that we're just using to get along with others. If I go to 7-Eleven and they say, do you want a plastic bag? And then I say, there's no 'I' here, not sure what you're talking about. That's going to create some friction. So that's an example where that may not be noble speech. Even to talk about the Dharma can be seen as ignoble if we're not doing it mindfully. And what does it mean to do it mindfully? To be friendly about it. Of course, one of the easiest ways to practice noble speech is just by not saying much of anything at all, giving people a smile, a warm reminder that everything's okay. A great way to practice Noble Speech is just to tell people good morning. In fact, sitting on the porch here, Dhammarato and I, there's some days where we don't say much at all, but we do say good morning to each other. And that's really just a social norm that's completely unnecessary. But it's just a nice friendly way to be, so we do it. Easy peasy. In fact, these easier ways of speaking is something that's worthwhile. Talking takes quite a lot of energy and burns calories even. And so what you're talking about, what you're saying, the phrases that you're using, are they really worthwhile? And this is true again for what kind of speech? The speech that we use inside the mind. The speech that we use inside the mind is reflected and the speech that we use in life. And the speech that we use in life reminds us to use noble speech within the mind. When we practice like this, the practice gets easier and easier and easier, more enjoyable. There's the fruit right there. Eat it now. Don't have to go anywhere for the fruit. The fruit is here for you to enjoy right now. Yes, Dietri.

**Speaker B:** So would you say like the way you talk to yourself also reflects on the way you talk to others and vice versa?

**Speaker A:** Yes, and you may even see a reflection in the way that they change their speech as well, the people that you talk to. So there's all sorts of reflections happening. When you shine a light, it gets reflected all over the place.

**Speaker B:** And if people are very judgmental, are always blaming others, I always got the feeling, oh right, you might be blaming yourself as well. It's like they say, if you point one finger, three are pointing back. If you're like this, three points back to yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And really what you're doing is, is you're sticking your finger in a blender while it's still on.

**Speaker B:** Ouch.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah, take your hand out of the blender. Yeah, don't need to point at people. I'm glad you brought that up. We often talk about monks do not criticize other monks. Honestly, it's worthwhile to get in the habit of not needing to criticize anyone. And in fact, even if you have, say, a friend that you're close with, you do feel comfortable pointing something out to them. You can do it in a way that doesn't criticize them. But this takes creativity. This takes fun. This takes playfulness. It takes practice. And in fact, a lot of the ways that we speak is through the body, through the body's language. You know, there are different ways of saying good morning. If you walk in and you're surrounded by people and you say, good morning, that's not going to have much of an effect. In fact, it might ruin some people's moods. But if you walk in and you say, good morning, Happy to see you. And this is really the noble perspective is it's not about what you say. And we can even take this to other areas. It's not about what you do. It's about how you do it. Are you doing it in a friendly way? Are you being mindful? Even if you are doing it in a friendly and mindful way, is there a more wholesome way to do it? That's the game to play. It's not about chasing perfection and saying, how can I be the most perfect, wholesome person I can possibly be? It's just enjoying the practice of applying the mind to the wholesome here and now. It's worthwhile to do because it's enjoyable. It has the benefit of helping others, sure. But to be honest with you, a lot of Dharma friends are selfish people. They come into this wanting to fix themselves, saying, "Oh, I'm broken." Yeah, go ahead, Lars, you had something you wanted to say.

**Speaker D:** People talk about constructive criticism and all, but So an example, I have a friend and she bought some land and she only has so much money and she thinks she's going to build a small house, but with all the different costs, it seems questionable that she's going to be able to accomplish it. But I can't really say that to her because she's very sensitive and would see it as entirely negative. But it's kind of like the same pattern that you see a lot of times. People kind of live in an imaginary world where they imagine reality a certain way and you can't you can't really tell them maybe that's not reality because they're not going to listen, they're not going to like it. And, but you know, people talk about constructive criticism, and even if you think it's constructive, they may not see it that way.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's no such thing as constructive criticism. It's all destructive. But you know, there's people that believe in Santa Claus. Are you going to be the one to go tell them that Santa Claus isn't real?

**Speaker D:** Well, he doesn't have reindeer, but he was a real person.

**Speaker A:** Well, we're talking about the mythical magical Santa Claus. Are you going to be the one to tell all the kids that Santa's not going to bring them their toys this year? That's the thing, right? You don't need to take people's toys away. You don't need to take away their imaginary friends. You don't need to take away their magical beliefs to start talking Dhamma with them or to give them friendly advice.

**Speaker D:** So you may have— you might think something is real and they're going to tell you it's not real, but maybe they're wrong.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know what's real. If you stop thinking that something's real, then you You won't have to get involved in that conversation to begin with. Yeah, they're building a house. So what? Is the house real? I don't know. It certainly isn't if they're still building it.

**Speaker D:** If you work at a company, they'll always be telling you, well, we're going to give you some constructive criticism, you know.

**Speaker A:** And they're lying to you. They say it's constructive criticism. To make you feel better about it, right? And then they slap you across the face anyways. You know, artists especially, they love to use that word. It's, 'Oh, I'd like to give you some constructive criticism,' and really what they're saying is, 'I want to tear you apart.' you and everything you stand for. Why? Because the artist knows that when another artist makes something, they put themselves into it. Same thing is true for people that build a house or whatever your job may be. People put themselves into their work and what they do. Yeah, I could go around and tell everybody, hey, the job you do doesn't matter. But that would upset a lot of people, and I don't have any reason to do that, nor do you. I'm not sure I should even be laughing at it, obviously, but the idea is just a bit funny. We don't need to go around taking things away from people. I mean, because the truth is that all of society is made up. This idea that you need money, money is a made-up thing. This idea that there's scarcity, scarcity is all made up. It's all just a big story. It's all mind games. People have been telling one another, and then everyone goes along. I mean, the truth is, is that everybody believes in some sort of Santa Claus or Sky Daddy.

**Speaker D:** It's like it's collective consciousness. You agree that?

**Speaker A:** I didn't hear what you said, Lars. Lars, you may need to reconnect. Yeah, can't hear you. But yeah, I mean, yeah, man. Oh, now I can hear you. Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I think of it as a collective consciousness in some way. Like, there's like, say, like, it has value because people think it does, but.

**Speaker A:** You don't need to think about it that way. That's what we're saying. You don't need to concoct it as something, as, oh, it's a collective consciousness. Because there's the other perspective that, oh, it's all individual thoughts. It's all individual moments and, you know, separate things that are all dominoes, you know, interacting with one another, right? I mean, again, these are just views. The teaching is to not hold on to any views and to let that which is holding on, let that die. When we're talking about let you die, let the I, me, and my die, go to the deathless. That's what this means, is to stop creating these concepts, is to stop thinking that there is a need to hold on to them. There's not a need to hold on to this concept that your boss is your boss, even Your boss is not your boss. That's just a title that someone gave him or her.

**Speaker D:** Go out, live in the woods, you don't own the land, then somebody's going to come and remove you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because of a bunch of rules. Somebody else made up because of concepts. You know, these people, they're playing along in this game, this imaginary game, this fairy tale, this story that Santa Claus came along and gave somebody some land rights, and now you're gonna get kicked out of it and get a pile of coal. And what we're saying is, is that you don't have to take away people's game that they're playing. You don't have to take away people's toys, their magical beliefs. You can analyze the game here to leave that stuff alone and to say, I'm not going to stick my hand in the blender, I'm not going to get involved with that. I don't need to go beyond someone's land where I'm not welcome, where they have these made-up rules that it's their land and yada yada yada. A noble mind can recognize that and can see that, oh, not every other mind is going to be noble, because yeah, if it was, yeah, we wouldn't be even talking about whose land is whose. Yeah, go ahead, Deidre.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know if this applies to you, Lars, but I had always this big identity of wanting to help everybody and get them out of the gutter and whatever, they're unhappy. And finally I realized that it was really me wanting them to be happy. So it's my longing. And sometimes you just have to let them, allow them to create their experiences because that's where they grow and that's where they learn. And if you take that from them, if people have no money, they're broke or whatever, of course there's no need to be unfriendly or whatever. But if you come with a lesson like you should do this like that and and I'm going to help you, I'm going to be your savior. Actually, you're not doing them a favor and you're not doing yourself a favor because you're going to be the one they're going to call and rely on all the time when it goes wrong. There is a lesson to be learned and let them learn it. I mean, don't let them die. I mean, you can give them food or whatever, or of course you can help them. There's nothing wrong being friendly. But wanting to save them is another thing. That's something from you and not from them.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. Thank you so much for that, teacher. Viriya and go ahead, you have something to say. Yeah, I was gonna say, rather than trying to teach them by like saying stuff to them, just show them how joyful right practice is. Show them how happy you you can get by practicing right. Yeah, I always love reminding myself that. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you. Yeah, that was well put. Go ahead, Ben. Thanks. Even in that example, like someone's trying, your friend wants to build a house, Lars, and you're not sure it's possible. We don't know. You don't know.

**Speaker C:** Maybe it is possible.

**Speaker A:** Maybe things are always changing, maybe something will change and she'll build the house and then it'll be fine, like, not sure, not certain, don't know, like.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I do pray for every day that she can live there, but there's reasons to have doubts, but yeah, I do pray about it. Hope it works.

**Speaker A:** Out. Yeah, you don't need to pray for her. The house may fall apart, and if she's living in it, then it's a good thing that she's not there. That's the thing, is, you know, people get involved in trying to build a house or buy a house, and they try to carry the house on their back. And it crushes them, sometimes financially, sometimes physically, sometimes both.

**Speaker D:** Well, I mean, you think life has a purpose.

**Speaker A:** It goes back to what we were talking about with the future versus the now, is it's not necessarily a good thing for your friend to get a house. Not saying it's a bad thing, just saying don't know. Let go, let go, let go of the me, the my, the I that's saying, I know what would be better. I know what would be right. I know what's going to help, because you don't know. And it's actually easier to enjoy life not knowing. Because it's also the truth. We're not just lying to ourselves and saying, oh yeah, I don't know, but secretly we do know. No, it's you don't know. Don't have to get involved in that. Don't have to stick my hand in that blender. When we start worrying about people, we're giving ourselves a job to do. And now that person is our boss. So be your own boss. And the thing to tell yourself is, take it easy, man. Hey, take five. Right now. Take 10, take 15. I don't care if you come back. Oh, you're going? Oh, I don't care about that either. Does anybody have anything else they'd like to say for today's talk?

**Speaker E:** I'll say, when we're considering the future, it's just a concept, right? And it's not necessary most of the time to dwell on the future. What Dhammarato says, I like this quote that he says, is all we have to do is take care of this moment. And if we can take care of this moment, then the future will take care of itself. Moment by moment, if you can take care of your mind in this moment, then the outside world, the future will take care of itself. So just take care of this moment as well as you can, as wholesome as you can, as joyful as you can. And that's your only task. That's my only task personally. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Thank you for saying that, David. And really the idea that, oh, you know, do good actions for the future. That's the type of thing that is the teaching that's given to ordinary people, or that is an ordinary teaching. That is a teaching for people that are unable to understand for one reason or another. That you can make a change now and be in the here and now. You can stop being reborn right now. So did anybody else have something they wanted to say before we wrap things up? Okay.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by Mikey (Speaker A) with the Sangha UK, explores the themes of **Noble Speech versus Ordinary Speech** and **living in the "here and now"** as a gateway to the **"Realm of the Deathless."** Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Here and Now vs. Future Thinking**
*   **All thoughts about the past or future are conceptual.** Even accurate predictions are still mental constructs created in the present moment.
*   **We are always in the "here and now,"** but we forget by getting lost in conceptual thinking. The practice is to return our attention to the present to develop wholesome mental qualities like mindfulness (*ānāpānasati*) and friendliness.
*   **We can only accurately judge the wholesomeness of our actions *right now*.** While we can plan for the future, we cannot control or perfectly predict outcomes. The most reliable way to ensure a happy future is to cultivate peace, happiness, and wholesome states **in the present moment**.

### **On Kamma (Karma) and Planning**
*   The **fruit of kamma is often experienced in the present**—for example, the joy felt when planning a generous act (like offering food to monastics) is an immediate result.
*   Planning is not rejected, but the **attitude** matters. It's more skillful to be open and adaptable ("I'm going out") rather than rigidly attached to a specific outcome ("I'm going to the beach"), which can lead to disappointment when conditions change.
*   We cannot know the long-term results of our actions with certainty (e.g., the offered food might cause an allergic reaction). Therefore, focus on the purity of the current intention.

### **The Realm of the Deathless**
*   This refers to a state of mind free from clinging and identification with the impermanent. The Buddha's instruction to "stop being reborn" is interpreted as stopping the **mental rebirth** of "I," "me," and "mine" **in the present moment**.
*   **Deathlessness is not the immortality of the body,** but the end of clinging to what is born and dies. It is the realization that phenomena (like a cloud changing into rain) transform rather than perish.
*   It involves **seeing thoughts, sensations, and the body as impersonal processes**—not as "self." This insight releases fear and dissatisfaction.

### **Noble Speech vs. Ordinary Speech**
*   **Noble Speech is about the *quality* and *intention* behind words,** not about rigid rules (like avoiding profanity). It is speech that is friendly, mindful, and opens up understanding.
*   It often involves **simplifying and removing "middlemen"**—extraneous concepts, judgments, and unnecessary details from communication.
*   **Key characteristics:**
    *   **Reflects Noble Mind:** The way you speak to others reflects and reinforces how you speak to yourself internally. Letting go of internal criticism reduces the urge to criticize others.
    *   **Is Playful and Creative:** Finding friendly, non-harming ways to communicate, even difficult truths.
    *   **Is Energy-Conscious:** Recognizes that speech takes effort; asks if what's being said is truly worthwhile.
    *   **Emphasizes "How" over "What":** The friendliness and mindfulness behind an action or word are more important than the specific content.

### **Practical Applications and Insights**
*   **Perfection:** The goal is not perfection, but wholesome practice in the present. A "perfect" moment from a noble perspective is one of acceptance, without wanting things to be different.
*   **Letting Go of "Helping":** The desire to "fix" or "save" others often stems from our own longing and can be a burden. True help is often demonstrated **by embodying joy and peace** through one's own practice, not by imposing advice.
*   **Releasing Views:** Society's constructs (money, ownership, status) are agreed-upon stories. A noble mind recognizes these as concepts without needing to aggressively dismantle others' beliefs. The practice is to **not cling to any fixed view**, thereby not getting entangled in conflicts born from conceptual disagreements.
*   **The Ultimate Task:** As summarized by a participant, the entire practice boils down to: **"Take care of this moment."** By tending to the mind with wholesomeness right now, the future naturally unfolds from that foundation.

**Conclusion:** The talk encourages a shift from future-oriented, conceptual thinking to present-moment awareness and wholesome intention. Through mindful attention to our thoughts and speech in the "here and now," we cultivate a mind that is joyful, flexible, and less identified with the changing world, touching the peaceful "Deathless" realm of non-clinging.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the Dhamma points about living in the present, noble speech, and the deathless. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1. **The Cloud (Thich Nhat Hanh’s metaphor)**  
   - **Usage:** To explain the "deathless" or non-clinging.  
   - **Meaning:** A cloud never truly dies; it transforms into rain, then back into vapor, etc. Similarly, when there’s no clinging to a fixed self, there’s no "death" of that self—only continuous change without suffering.

2. **Sticking Your Hand in a Blender**  
   - **Usage:** To describe the harm of criticizing or blaming others.  
   - **Meaning:** When you point fingers or judge others, you’re the one who gets hurt (like sticking your hand in a running blender). It’s a vivid warning against unwholesome speech and mental habits.

3. **The Fruit is Here to Eat Now**  
   - **Usage:** To emphasize enjoying the benefits of practice in the present moment.  
   - **Meaning:** You don’t have to wait for future results; the "fruit" of wholesome action (joy, peace) is available immediately when you practice rightly.

4. **Carrying a House on Your Back**  
   - **Usage:** To describe the burden of over-identifying with plans or possessions.  
   - **Meaning:** Becoming overly attached to future outcomes (like building a house) can crush you mentally and physically—a metaphor for the weight of clinging.

5. **Words as Tools in a Toolbox**  
   - **Usage:** To describe noble speech.  
   - **Meaning:** Words like "I" or "you" are just cultural tools; a noble person uses them without attaching to a solid self, skillfully and without friction.

6. **Santa Claus / Sky Daddy**  
   - **Usage:** To describe collectively believed-in constructs (money, land ownership, status).  
   - **Meaning:** Many societal rules and beliefs are like shared fairy tales—they have power only because people agree to them. A noble mind sees them as conventions without clinging to them as ultimate truths.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **The Cat’s Reaction Time vs. Human Delay**  
   - **Story:** Cats react instantly to a snake strike, while humans have a delayed neural response (e.g., feeling a cut after it happens).  
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate that "here and now" in meditation means being with the *mind’s experience* of sensations, not the physical event itself, which is always slightly past.

2. **Ajahn Sumedho Saying “You’re Perfect”**  
   - **Story:** Ajahn Sumedho would tell people they were perfect, but no one believed him.  
   - **Purpose:** To show how our judgment and desire to be different create dissatisfaction. "Perfect" in a noble sense means accepting things as they are, without seeking change.

3. **Offering Food to a Monk Who Has an Allergic Reaction**  
   - **Story:** You plan to make merit by offering food to a monk, but the monk has an allergic reaction and falls ill.  
   - **Purpose:** To demonstrate that we can’t predict the future results of our actions (kamma); the real "fruit" is the wholesome intention and joy in the present moment of giving.

4. **The Boss as a Mere Title**  
   - **Anecdote:** Your boss isn’t inherently your boss—it’s just a role we agree upon.  
   - **Purpose:** To encourage seeing through social constructs and not taking labels so seriously, reducing mental friction.

5. **Not Telling Children Santa Isn’t Real**  
   - **Analogy:** You don’t need to ruin someone’s cherished belief (like Santa or a dream) to be helpful.  
   - **Purpose:** Noble speech isn’t about bluntly imposing "truth" but about kindness and skillfulness—not taking away people’s "toys" unnecessarily.

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
- **Immediacy vs. Future Projection:** The talk contrasts the solid, predictable "here and now" with the uncertain, conceptual future.
- **Deathless as Fluid vs. Fixed Identity:** Metaphors of clouds, changing cells, and stars illustrate impermanence without a fixed self.
- **Speech as Reflection:** How internal and external speech mirror each other, and how changing one changes the other.

These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist concepts like *anatta* (not-self), *kamma*, and *samma vaca* (right speech) relatable and memorable.
