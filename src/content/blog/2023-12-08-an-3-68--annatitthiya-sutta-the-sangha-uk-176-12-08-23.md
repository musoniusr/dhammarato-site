### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All righty. Okay. Hello everyone. Welcome to the UK Sangha call. That's every week. And check the chat for what day it's going to be because impermanence, my schedule changes. But I'm here with my really good friend Alexander. It always brightens up my day to see my noble friend and enjoy company together and discuss some good Dharma. So it's like there's something a little bit unique about these types of interactions and get-togethers, because normally when people get together in a group, they're usually gossiping about somebody or they're complaining about something or something to that nature. So that those types of friendships aren't really beneficial to the people engaging in them. So like, that's why the Buddha recommends to make friends with wise people and spend time in wise company, because monkey see, monkey do, right? It's gonna— hey, Grant, welcome! Good to have you on. Hey, yeah, we're just talking about how the people that you associate yourself with is going to inevitably have an effect on you, like on how you view things, on the kind of like patterns and habits that you adopt. So this is why the Buddha recommends spending time with wise company and wise friendships. Because if you're spending time with a fool, like foolish types of people, it's going to rub off on you. So if you're going to the bar and hanging out with a bunch of alcoholics, the chances are you're going to become an alcoholic as well. So it's just kind of a common sense approach to like who we decide to spend our time with. And I wasn't just trying to mention negative things or be a downer, but I was I was mentioning how special these types of interactions are when we come together on these Sangha calls, because the only thing we talk about is Dhamma. The only thing we talk about is wholesome. And this has an effect on how we feel. So if we're gossiping and complaining about stuff with other people and just kind of using other people to justify our own pity parties and victim complexes, you're not going to wind up, end up feeling good about that. And those friendships wouldn't— aren't really beneficial to somebody who's a sincere practitioner. So a common thing for many people who start on the spiritual path is they really struggle with loneliness a lot of the times because they find themselves losing a lot of the friends that they used to have because the differentiation and ideals and values, you know, you stop caring so much as much about like politics and things of this nature that just create more conflict, you know, and you start caring more about harmony and happiness experienced in the moment. So if we're going to get together, why waste our time being Debbie Downers. Why not appreciate the friendship that we have here and just appreciate life as it happens? Okay, so that was just me going on kind of like a spontaneous sidetrack. If anyone has anything they ever want to jump into the conversation, feel free to cut me off at any point. But I do, if there's not anything you guys want to talk about in particular, I do have a sutta prepared that I was going to read.

**Speaker B:** I would love to hear the sutta, Scott. Grant, do you have anything you want to talk? I would love to hear.

**Speaker C:** No, I'm just here to say hi and have a listen. So yeah, let's do that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool. Let's do the sutta then. All right, so this is from the Anguttara Nikaya, and it's 3.68. For those who want to read along, I posted a link in the chat, and it's titled Followers of Other Religions. Okay, mendicants. If wanderers of other religions were to ask There are these three things. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. These are the three things. What's the difference between them? How would you answer them? Okay, so one of the main tenets of the teachings of the Buddha is that the three big kahunas, or the three major things that poison the mind of someone or creates psychological suffering for someone and other people is greed, hatred, and delusion. So I mean, this isn't really that much different than many other religions out there. So I mean, most sincere spiritual traditions practice not hating people, for one. So getting rid of hate, getting rid of greed. So all the things that cause conflicts and like suffering for people in their lives and for other people. So I mean, this is pretty just, this is like, I mean, this is pretty perennial here. But the Buddha really categorizes it in these three things. If there is a hindrance or defilement or some sort of agitation, it is only because of one of these three things. And that's like the efficiency of it. But I'll continue with the sutta. Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it. Wind mendicants, listen and apply your mind well. I will speak. Yes, sir, they replied. The Buddha said this, mendicants: If wanderers of other religions were to ask, there are these three things. What three? Greed, hatred, and delusion. Okay, so I'm gonna just skip skip a little bit through and paraphrase because it often repeats itself. But essentially they ask, what's the difference between those three things? And then the difference is stated to be greed is mildly blameworthy, but slow to fade away. Okay, so greed is not as blameworthy as the other ones, but it's slow to fade away. It's lingering. It's hard not to— it's hard to get rid of greed. We want things. Things are appealing. The comforts of life and all the things that are shining, like shine. Ooh, I want that shiny thing, right? Like shining as in psychologically shining. Like if you look at a sparkly gem, why does that have value? It's just a rock, right? It's value because it's shiny. So like people attribute values to things because of the appearance of them. But anyways, it's not that bad, but it's slow to fade away. And then the next one is hate is very blameworthy, but quick to fade away. So if you notice someone who's experiencing hate, that kind of tends to bite a little bit more. It doesn't feel good to hate, right? So hate may like explode in someone but quickly go away. I've seen, I've seen videos of, of like people who are like, uh, Ku Klux Klan members, and, and there's a, an African-American who just went to talk to these people and just straight up have a conversation of, hey, I'm a normal person. And he actually ended up making friends with some of those Ku Klux Klan members, and they stopped being racist. So hate is really blameworthy, right? It's a really bad thing. But hate can go away quickly. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's a quicker process to let go of hate than it is greed, or like desire for things, right? And then finally, the last one. So delusion is the ultimate— delusion is the ultimate snare. So that's why delusion is said to be very blameworthy, and it's slow to fade away. So it's hard to wake up out of the patterns of our own minds. And it's the most blameworthy. So that's what— so, so out of all these three things, the Buddha is emphasizing delusion as the most difficult and, and sneaky one. It's the trickery of delusion, right? That's what, uh, Mara— Mara in the Buddhist cosmology is a personification of this, of delusion. Mara wants to keep you like playing tricks on you, keep you deluded, keep you enchanted and infatuated with the game of life or the show of life. It wants to keep you like thinking any of this really has any substantial existence or matters at all when it's just going to be here one moment, gone the next. If you don't realize how quickly life goes by, how quickly aging and death is really going to come, that this very body that's speaking right now is going to die, then you're going to fall under the illusion that it isn't going to die. And you're going to be subconsciously thinking and feeling and defending your sense of self, the destination of this body, as if it's a permanent thing. So That's the main delusion, is the delusion of inherent permanent selfhood. Or saying selfhood can be misunderstood by people who don't understand no-self. So it's better to say inherent permanent separate selfhood. So people may misunderstand selfhood as like there's nothing here at all. Like, that's not the point I'm trying to make. The point I'm trying to make is there's no separate self from the rest of reality. It's all just one continuous unfoldment of causes and conditions, like a big game of dominoes. It's all dependently arising, and it's all arising according to the same laws and intelligence. It's just that this intelligence, you can call it God, but it's not a sky daddy. It's not a being, right? It's not a person. Like, people will see God as they see themselves. If you see yourself as a separate self, of course, you're going to project that onto God and see God as like some sort of deity, right? But any authentic mystic, even Christian mystics or whatnot, realize God as that which is like unfathomable, formless, ever-present, like the intelligence by which all of this is created. So it's not really a person. But anyways, I keep going on a sidetrack. Let me get back to the— let me get back to the sutta. Yeah, delusion. Okay. And if they ask, what is the cause? What is the reason why greed arises? And once arisen, it increases and grows. You should say the beautiful feature of things. When you apply the mind irrationally to the beautiful feature of things, greed arises. And once arisen, it increases and grows. This is the cause. This is the reason why greed arises. And once arisen, it increases and grows. Okay, so this is the thing, is that greed is going to arise just because of how quickly the mind is and our instinctual drives, right? But you have a choice whether you decide it increases and grows or kind of fades away, right? You're at the beach, you see a beautiful young girl. You can decide where your eyes— after the seeing them once is inevitable, right? That's just going to happen. It's going to be a need, a brain reaction, just to look. But you decide whether— where your gaze is going to go after that, right? Whether the the infatuation is going to grow or not. You could be like, oh, beautiful girl, okay, continue on my way. But if you direct the mind irrationally into that enchantment of like the appearance of it, then it will just grow and grow. And you will be in a state of suffering. It doesn't make you happy. It just makes you in a state of lack, a state of desire, right? Uh, so I mean, this is— this isn't like a preachy preachy thing. Like, this is just, uh, for happiness. I mean, I'm not saying that like you can't appreciate like, you know, beautiful things, but, um, um, for the sake of whether or not it's truly appreciating or you're lusting after something, uh, is for you to decide. Right, there's a difference between appreciating and desiring. But.

**Speaker C:** Uh, it's the difference between enjoying something, uh, as a moment and wanting that moment to stay around and grasping that moment.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. There's a— that, that's the total difference. And then that's also, um, how Jhana works too, because even when you get into a spiritual states of happiness that is totally wholesome and pure, right? There's a difference between appreciating that and wanting it to stay, as Grant just mentioned. And this is going to decide whether the Jhana actually evolves and takes you to ultimate happiness, or whether it quickly goes away and like You're just sad that it's over now, right? But.

**Speaker C:** Anyways, that old trick.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that old trick. No, I'm sure anyone who's managed to get into Jhana definitely is either a genius or has ran into this problem. Like, I don't know, maybe you're like a Jhana prodigy and like you never had that problem. But for most of us who managed to get into Jhana, the first problem is getting pooped right out of it and then going right back into sorrow, lamentation, and despair because you've been to heaven and now you realize how bad hell really is. Right? So that, that some people can call this a dark night of the soul or something. Like, you've been to like the heights, the mountaintop, and then, but you, you don't know how, you're not established in it, and you don't know how to get back there because you didn't even know how you got there. You just wound up there spontaneously. So that's why we practice cultivating the mind and why we practice Buddhism, because we actually find out how to intentionally get there. And stay there whenever we want, because it comes from the end of delusion and like the clarity and understanding of our own mind. But let me continue with the sutta. Right, so the next one is going to be hate. So why does hate arise? And once arisen, it increases and grows. You should say the feature of harshness. When you apply the mind irrationally to the feature of harshness, hate arises, and once arisen, increases and grows. This is the cause, this is the reason why hate arises, and once arisen, it increases and grows. So I guess, so some of these translations, it leaves room for interpretation, right? Like the feature of harshness, what does that mean exactly?

**Speaker B:** One of the ways I think about the feature of harshness is I think about perhaps a certain way that I entertain a perception of pressure. Okay, so when I'm feeling pressured to do something or other, if I look at that and I develop and cultivate a perception of harshness, then all of a sudden I'm reactive towards whatever Dhamma is arising within my experience, you know. And yet if I accept that non-discriminatorily, you know, just with no discrimination, no perception of harshness, or even better, if I do a little replacement, replace it with a perception of lightness, you know, then we're really cooking. But a perception of harshness, to me, this is something that we generate in response to contact at one of the sense doors when we don't guard the mind.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah, no, that's exactly right. So it's like some sort of tension in the body, some sort of agitation, harshness, heaviness, right? Pressure, feeling localized, feeling imprisoned. Feeling pressurized. So this, this tension in the body, this is the feature of harshness. And when you apply the mind irrationally to this feature, hate increases. So if you've ever been really angry in a fit of rage, right, it's because you're like getting more and more agitated, more and more harshness, more and more pressure, more and more constriction. And this is like clenching your fist on a hot coal and just burning it and burning it when you could just let go. So the idea is to realize, yikes, oh, this harshness is hot. Let me get— let me— so you have to— so when you see the pain of it, you see the danger of it. Then you're going to let go of that harshness naturally. It just seems like the natural thing to do, right? Effortless acceptance. But the next one would be delusion. And once delusion, once arisen, it increases and grows. Why? When you apply the mind irrationally. So irrational application of the mind, that's the only cause. So the other two included irrational application of the mind, but to a specific direction. But delusion as a whole, this is why it encompasses the other two, because it's just irrational application of the mind. So directing your mind to things which are unfit for attention. So the Buddha constantly says this. He categorically says there's a right direction of mind and a wrong direction of mind. There's only two kinds of thoughts, wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. It's one or the other. There's no in-between. So every moment is an opportunity to go in the right direction or the wrong direction. And this is going to determine whether your presently arisen suffering subsides, or, and the flip-flop, or whether suffering that's not there arises because your mind trails off into an unwholesome direction. And, you know, if this is going to happen for everybody who starts practicing, And if you get even 5 minutes per hour of wholesome mind, that's good. Even a minute. If you can do a minute an hour where you're only in a wholesome state of mind, you're making good progress. Right? So it's like you want to just kind of start the fire and like kindle it and kindle it and nourish it and eventually it'll grow and grow. And you'll find yourself to be happier and happier. This happiness can be stabilized, right? I mean, we're going to go through ups and downs, right? But they quickly change. Everything flows through faster because like there's no clinging, there's no stickiness to the emotions. It's like, yeah, I can experience emotions, like all the full range of emotions, but they don't stick to me as myself. They just arise, appear, dissipate. But that came with a lot of practice. And Anicca, I see people— and effective practice, right? You can actually practice a lot, but if you're not practicing right, you can get nowhere fast.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But if you practice efficiently, if you practice according to the teachings of the Buddha, It can be very fast. Like, canonically, for Sariputta, it only took him 2 weeks to go through all the Jhanas and realize Nirvana. Like, Sariputta met the Buddha, and it's like, okay, 2 weeks later that he's fully enlightened. And like, and just to be clear, I don't recommend thinking about attainments. Thinking you're going to become attained or ever claiming an attainment. I don't recommend that at all. But I use attainments as a way to brighten my mind and inspire inspiration to practice. Right? So it's just how you use things. Something can be used, it's just a tool, right? If you use it wrong, it's going to create judgment, comparison, even more delusion, right? A sense of self. Or you can use it in the right direction and you can be like, if I'm happy right now, I am an Arhat right now. Right? If I have no greed, hatred, and delusion in this moment, I'm an Arhat. But who is me to be an Arhat, right? An Arhat is just the liberated mind, the nature of mind without, in the absence of greed, hatred, and delusion. An Arhat is not a person. Right? And the Arhat doesn't have a body-mind address. It's simply reality and the knowledge and vision of reality as it actually is. And it's the same reality for everybody. Everybody is that reality. So it's like to claim this person is an Arahant based off what? Based off your imagination or claim yourself as an Arahant. are hot. Based off what? Based off the past, your recollection of the past or your prediction of the future. Because I can say for a fact that I'm happy right now, but I can't say for a fact that I'll be happy forever into the future because I'm not experiencing the future. Right? The future is a concept in my mind. So I just went on that side tangent because I see a lot of people in Buddhist communities really obsessed with attainments, and I don't think I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. But if you use it in the right way, it can be a very powerful practice tool.

**Speaker B:** One of the very powerful practice tools I hear you talking about, Scott, is the idea that the mind is worthy of gifts. When we see firsthand that the mind is worthy of gifts, there's no question. The cheetah gives it gifts.

**Speaker A:** Right? So that's the idea of, uh, in Buddhism, of being a noble, uh, is, uh, the way that an Arahant just means noble one. And a noble one in the Buddhist teaching, or the Buddhist teaching, is just somebody who's worthy of gifts. So if you recognize your self-worth, that you hold yourself as a noble, you walk into the room like you own the place, you start to develop that attitude of nobility, right? That I am worthy of this, right? Most people live their lives feeling like an imposter. They don't feel like they belong. But if you walk into places like you're noble, with a noble state of mind, And it's not arbitrary, because you are practicing to have a pure state of mind. And when you practice to have a pure state of mind, you are a noble, you're a noble person. It's noble to practice Buddhism. It's noble to practice coming out of suffering. So yeah, to view yourself as a noble, it's very empowering. And I recommend it. But if you're trying to convince other people that you're enlightened, you're probably falling into some traps, right? An enlightened person doesn't care if other people think they're enlightened, right? No thanks, you can have your enlightenment. I'd rather be happy. I'm good without it. I don't need enlightenment, right? Who's the more enlightened person in that scenario? But yeah, that's a really good point.

**Speaker C:** Because it's a middle path with this, isn't it? Between becoming attached to the attainments or thinking the attainments are somehow a distraction and sort of putting yourself down at that point going, yeah, but I'm not there yet. So it's getting the balance and it's such a fine balance because you can— it's No, you're never quite— balancing is always about movement. You're always correcting.

**Speaker A:** The— on the, you.

**Speaker C:** Know, when you're on one foot, you're always just moving. So you're never going to be right there, but you've got to know where the point is and feel it when you're there. Yeah. And I've— and then if you go too far, like I have, you're over— I'm back up. I'm back up again. Yeah, but you've, you've described it really well. That's my experience of trying to keep the balance point between balance. Yeah. You know, become overinflated and becoming down. You know, that balance point is so important.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. There is a middle way. Yeah, no, that's, that's a really good nugget of wisdom. Thanks for sharing that. Yeah, it's like it is a balancing act, and like the more you do the practice balance, the better you get at it and becomes second nature, right? When I first started snowboarding, I was falling over and eating, eating the snow all the time. But now I'm balancing on the board like effortlessly. Practice is the same way. You practice, you keep practicing that balance, your body is going to learn balance. If you practice bodily relaxation, your body will start to intuitively know how to relax. Right? So most people don't know how to relax. So that's part of the practice is learning how to breathe and relax your body intentionally. And if you like start getting into a more and more relaxed state, it's going to become the habit. It's going to become the new like intuitive thing for your body to do. Just like how we can drive a car and be eating a sandwich, texting, drinking a coffee and doing our makeup at the same time or something, right? Because we already intuitively know how to drive a car. But when you first start, you have to very mechanically and intentionally do meditation. And then it becomes not so much a thing, rather than it becomes something that you can intentionally fall into. So like, you know how to relax. It's weird, like from a more advanced practice, the advice becomes so, so much simpler, and people may take the simplicity for granted, right? Yeah, just relax, don't think about it, don't think about things. And people will be like, oh, that's too simple. But it's the truth.

**Speaker C:** But it's not easy. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right. And then— good. Okay, so I'm just gonna pick up where I left off. The irrational application of mind. And it is a continuous practice. So like, even if you get really good, like, you still have to do it. You know, no one is beyond fault. Like, this is where people become like guru scandals and stuff, is they think they're At the end of the day, we're all human. So if you don't keep cleaning up your mind and guarding the mind, it's going to become— naturally, it's going to become polluted and destroyed. So it's a continuous practice. When you apply the mind irrationally, delusion arises, and once arisen, it increases and grows. This is the cause. This is the reason why delusion arises. And once arisen, it increases and grows. And if they ask, what is the cause? What is the reason why greed doesn't arise? Or if it's already arisen, it's given up? You should say the ugly feature of things. When you apply the mind rationally on the ugly feature of things, greed doesn't arise. Or if it's already arisen, it's given up. And this is the cause why greed doesn't arise. And then for love, it's what's the cause why hate doesn't arise, or if it's already arisen, it's given up. It is said, the heart's released by love. The heart's released by love. When you apply the mind rationally on the heart's release by love, hate doesn't arise, or if it's already arisen, it's given up. This is the cause why hate doesn't arise and why it's given up. Yeah, so when you direct the mind towards the power of love, like the happiness of love, you cultivate that love. It feels so much better than the hate that you're like naturally not going to want to do the opposite anymore. People think hate feels good at first because it makes them feel powerful. I'm going to hate this person. I'm going to get all angry and it's going to make me big, bad, and strong and a powerful person. So they think that it feels good at first. But then if they look at the experience of their body, they would realize how much pain they're actually in. Right, so once we look, we practice mindfulness, mindfulness of our body, of our thoughts, we can notice the pain that we're in, that we're creating for ourselves. And so we can go in a direction of relief and happiness and love, because I think we've all experienced love before. And I think everybody knows how good it feels just to feel love. Not to be attached to someone or something, but that just the pure experience of love. There's nothing better than it in the world. There really isn't. And this could be just looking at a sunset and just experience love of creation. Gratitude is another thing, another word for it. Just being in pure awe and gratitude of the beauty and the splendor of it all. Right? And that may include specific people, but it's not, it's not dependent on them. It's not confined to them. It includes the totality of it all. Yeah, so this type of love is the spiritual type of love that's liberating. And if you look at the consequences of someone who develops this, they're going to end up being a better husband, a better father, a better wife, a better son, a better brother. And they're going to end up treating the people around them with more patience, more compassion, more understanding. Right? If we're slow to anger, that's what makes a real man. If you cannot get angry when the stress is on, when somebody does step on your toes, if you can hold your composure, that's what makes you a real man. And like, that's what makes you a noble one, right? That's the quality of a noble mind. And it's a practice, you know, we're all going to get our buttons pushed. From time to time, right? But how quick can you wake up out of it? Oh, I got my buttons pushed, right? There it is again. Haha, let me just smile at that and laugh at it. Haha, how silly of me to get so worked up about that. Right? So the last one, what is the cause? What is the reason why delusion doesn't arise? Or if it's already arisen, it is given up. You should say rational application of the mind. When you apply the mind rationally, delusion doesn't arise, or if it's already arisen, it is given up. This is the cause, this is the reason why delusion doesn't arise. So that's why it's very practical, it's very pragmatic, rational application of mind. Everything we've been talking about, it's just if you're going to take a cost-benefit analysis of things and make a rational decision about the kinds of thoughts you want to think, the kinds of actions you're going to partake, which one causes more suffering and which one causes more happiness? It's a very rational cost-benefit analysis, right? But In ignorance, we're not using the frontal cortex part of our mind. We're not using the rational. We're intoxicated. We're blinded by passion. Right? This is why the Buddha emphasizes dispassion, is because when we're dispassionate about things, we have a kind of holy indifference to the happenings of the world and life. Then we look at things with rationality. And intelligence, we're going to make better decisions, right? These are the people like, I mean, hopefully that's what makes a good leader is someone who doesn't get— if we look at like the greats throughout history, and like Marcus Aurelius, for example, and you read some of his works, he was in as much power as he could be. And but he saw the danger of that power, he saw the danger of that wealth. Of all that wealth and ability over others. And he practiced, he practiced being stoic. So he practiced being dispassionate about it all. And that's why he was such a great leader and one of the greatest philosophers of all time. If you read some of those meditations, it sounds very Buddhist teaching, right? So this truth is universal. It appears in different forms everywhere. But it's also polluted in different forms everywhere, right? So it's for those with wisdom to see for themselves the truth of it in their own experience. You know, I like to say the proof is in the pudding, right? If your practice is leading to happiness, then it's a good practice. If it's not, if it's making you miserable, then don't do that, I guess. All right, so, um, yeah, I'm going to open it up to anyone who wants to talk. Uh, that was the end of the sutta there. Okay, my pleasure. Yes, thank you, Scott.

**Speaker C:** It occurs to me after listening to that, some of the solutions in the world that we want to try and solve, the more we want to solve them from an ego point of view, the worse the problem gets. So we have to do something that seems counterintuitive, which is really focusing on developing ourselves to a point where we can truly be of benefit to others. In a non-deluded way. And that leads to easy, easy solutions to problems. That's my experience of using the Dhamma in the world, is that things get a lot easier when you don't try and manipulate the world around you, but just go with what's in front of you. And suddenly everything gets a little bit better in your immediate environment and for the people that are with me as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That'S when real life happens. Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the immediate environment, the people that you interact with, right? That's where it's done. Like, people who become world savers, right? Those are the people like Hitler, like they want to save the world, right? World savers instead of saving yourself, right? If you save yourself, you save the world. The teachings of the Buddha have never been about changing the world. It's only ever been about changing the mind. Because there's nothing other to the world than the mind. The only way we experience the world is by mind. So the world is how you see it. If you see every— you go into places and you see things from the light side, you see things from a bright side, you see things from a happy point of view, you're gonna find out you're gonna make a lot more friends that way. You're gonna, you're gonna be more patient with people if you see the good in people and not all the ugly stuff. Right? You see, oh, he's just trying his best. We're all just trying our best. Right? We're either deluded to the point where our effort is just misallocated. But that person is still trying to be happy. They just don't know where to find it. And that's why I'm so grateful to stumble upon Buddhism and the teachers that I've had that were generous enough to teach me without even me paying them one dime. So I'm really grateful for that. And yeah, it's like the gift that keeps on giving. So I just come here and like share the joy and that sentiment. So thank you guys for coming. I really appreciate it. And if there's anything else that you guys want to talk about, I'm happy to continue. But it may have reached its natural conclusion, so that's okay too. All right, friends, wonderful to have you. And I'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** See you soon.

**Speaker C:** Nice to share. See you again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it was good to hear you talk, Grant. Thanks for coming.

**Speaker B:** Keep coming, Grant. We love you. We'll see you guys soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Scott)**, centers on the importance of spiritual friendship and a practical analysis of the three root poisons—greed, hatred, and delusion—based on a sutta from the Anguttara Nikaya.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1. **The Value of Wise Friendship (Kalyāṇamittatā)**  
   - The talk begins by highlighting the uniqueness of Sangha gatherings, where discussions focus solely on wholesome Dhamma, unlike ordinary social interactions that often involve gossip or complaint.  
   - The Buddha advised associating with wise people because our companions inevitably influence our habits and outlook. Spiritual practice can sometimes lead to loneliness as old friendships fade, but noble friendship supports growth in harmony and happiness.

2. **Analysis of the Three Poisons (Greed, Hatred, Delusion)**  
   - The group discusses **AN 3.68**, which compares greed, hatred, and delusion:  
     - **Greed** is *mildly blameworthy but slow to fade*—it arises from focusing on “the beautiful feature” of things.  
     - **Hatred** is *highly blameworthy but quick to fade*—it arises from focusing on “the feature of harshness” (e.g., pressure, tension).  
     - **Delusion** is *most blameworthy and slow to fade*—it arises from “irrational application of the mind.”  
   - Delusion is the fundamental trap, perpetuating the illusion of a separate, permanent self and blinding us to impermanence.

3. **Practical Application and Antidotes**  
   - **Greed** is countered by reflecting on the “ugly feature” of things (seeing their impermanent, unsatisfying nature).  
   - **Hatred** is abandoned by cultivating “the heart’s release by love” (metta)—focusing on kindness feels better and naturally dissolves anger.  
   - **Delusion** is overcome through **rational application of the mind**: directing attention skillfully, choosing wholesome over unwholesome thoughts.  
   - The practice is a continuous, mindful balancing act—neither clinging to attainments nor dismissing progress.

4. **The Role of Practice and Mind Training**  
   - Happiness is cultivated through intentional practice: starting with small moments of wholesome mind and gradually building stability.  
   - **Relaxation and mindfulness of the body** are essential; noticing the physical discomfort of hatred or greed helps us let go.  
   - Advanced practice simplifies to natural, effortless balance—like learning to relax or ride a bike until it becomes second nature.

5. **On Attainments and Nobility**  
   - Discussions about enlightenment should inspire rather than create comparison. In any moment free of greed, hatred, and delusion, the mind is “noble.”  
   - True nobility is an inner quality—seeing oneself as “worthy of gifts” because one is cultivating purity, not because of external validation.

6. **Transforming Self and Environment**  
   - Lasting change comes from working on our own minds, not trying to control the world. By cultivating inner peace, love, and clarity, we naturally benefit those around us.  
   - The Dhamma is a pragmatic, rational path: using cost-benefit analysis to choose thoughts and actions that reduce suffering and increase happiness.

### **Overall Tone and Message:**
The talk is warm, conversational, and practical—emphasizing that Dhamma practice is about everyday choices in thought and companionship. It encourages cultivating wholesome states through mindful attention, rational reflection, and the supportive context of spiritual friendship. The underlying theme is that freedom from suffering is possible here and now through intelligent, compassionate mind training.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Scott) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate the Dhamma teachings. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Monkey see, monkey do"** – Used to explain how the people we associate with inevitably influence our habits and views.
2.  **"The three big kahunas"** – A colloquial metaphor for greed, hatred, and delusion as the primary poisons of the mind.
3.  **"A big game of dominoes"** – Describes dependent origination and the continuous unfoldment of causes and conditions.
4.  **"Clenching your fist on a hot coal"** – Illustrates how holding onto hate (or harshness) burns and harms oneself; letting go is the natural solution.
5.  **"Kindling a fire"** – Represents the gradual nurturing and growth of wholesome mental states through practice.
6.  **"The gift that keeps on giving"** – Refers to the Dhamma and the joy of sharing it.
7.  **"Throwing the baby out with the bathwater"** – Advises against discarding the concept of attainments entirely just because it can be misused; it can be a useful tool if applied correctly.
8.  **"The proof is in the pudding"** – Means the value of the practice is demonstrated by its results (increased happiness) in one's own experience.
9.  **"Walking into the room like you own the place"** – A metaphor for cultivating the confident, noble attitude of one who is worthy of respect through pure mental conduct.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Bar and Alcoholics:** A story about how spending time with people who have negative habits (like alcoholics at a bar) makes it likely you'll adopt those habits yourself. This underscores the importance of wise friendship (*kalyāṇamittatā*).
2.  **The Ku Klux Klan Member:** An anecdote about an African-American man who disarmed racism and changed hearts by having a calm, personal conversation with KKK members. This story illustrates that hate, while very blameworthy, can fade away quickly when confronted with direct human connection.
3.  **The Sparkly Gem:** A brief reflection on how people attribute value to objects (like a gem) simply because they are "shiny" or appealing, which is a root of greed.
4.  **Seeing a Beautiful Person at the Beach:** A hypothetical scenario to explain the difference between initial sensory contact (seeing) and the subsequent choice to either let the perception go or "apply the mind irrationally" to it, allowing lust/greed to grow.
5.  **The Jhana Prodigy vs. The Common Meditator:** A contrast between a hypothetical genius who enters deep meditative states (*jhana*) without trouble and the more common experience of losing that state and feeling despair, highlighting the need for systematic practice.
6.  **Learning to Snowboard:** A personal analogy where the initial awkward, intentional effort of learning to snowboard is compared to early meditation practice. With time, balance becomes effortless and second nature, just as a relaxed, wholesome mind can become a new habit.
7.  **Driving a Car While Multitasking:** Illustrates how a skill (like driving) that once required intense focus becomes intuitive, allowing the mind to be elsewhere. This parallels how advanced meditation practice can become a natural, effortless state.
8.  **Marcus Aurelius:** Referencing the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher as a historical example of someone in a position of immense power who practiced dispassion and rationality, leading to wise leadership—paralleling Buddhist ideals.

### **Key Conceptual Analogies**
*   **Mara:** Described as the **personification of delusion**, a trickster who keeps one enchanted with the fleeting "show of life."
*   **The Dark Night of the Soul:** Used to describe the despair that can follow a temporary, unestablished spiritual high (like a lost *jhana*).
*   **God as Sky Daddy:** Contrasts the anthropomorphic, personal God with the Buddhist/Dharmic understanding of an impersonal, intelligent, formless reality or principle behind creation.
*   **The Arhat is Not a Person:** Emphasizes that enlightenment is not an identity but the **liberated nature of the mind itself** in the absence of defilements.
*   **World Savers vs. Self-Savers:** Contrasts the deluded, often destructive ambition to fix the external world (like Hitler) with the effective path of transforming one's own mind, which naturally benefits one's immediate environment.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist principles (like the three poisons, dependent origination, and right effort) more relatable, practical, and memorable for the audience.
