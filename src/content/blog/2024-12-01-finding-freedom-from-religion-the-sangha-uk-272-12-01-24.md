### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So folks, welcome to the Sunday afternoon Dhamma talk. It's mid-morning in Europe, and here in Thailand it's 4 in the afternoon. So December 1st, by the way, and that yesterday we had a topic on religion. Didn't want to talk about religion, but that was the question. And so we talked a lot about religion, mostly in the sense of that it's dying. You can see the vestiges of it dying. You can see the sequence of events of the death process. And we can see that a lot of people are still hating whatever religion that they're most familiar with. Even though it's dying. It's sort of like having a bad grandfather who's gotten so old that he can't leave his room or even his bed. He's on his deathbed, and the grandson goes in. Is he going to hate the grandfather for what happened 30 years ago, or is he going to be very loving at the last minute for his grandfather's death? And that's how we should actually look at religion. Is to congratulate it for what it's done for humanity over the past several thousand years, and then happily watch it die. So, there is a point to religion. And in fact, you could say that religion has a duty. To perform. And that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa referenced that duty that religion has in his book on "No Religion," where he says that there is no reason for anybody to convert to Buddhism, that they should be able to get all the freedom that they need from the religion of their birth. How many of you have read that kind of topic from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, it should be well known. Well, guess what? I disagree with Bhikkhuni on that, simply because he's referring to the religion's duty, that if people understood the duty of their religion and would follow that duty of the religion, then they would get great benefit out of it. Unfortunately, the way that I was raised about Christianity, I never really saw anyone following the duty of Christianity, and you could basically say that the duty of Christianity is fairly well stated by Jesus himself. But nobody listens to what Jesus says; they're too busy either nailing him on a cross, or taking him off the cross and letting him float up into the air. That's actually a joke about the Protestants, that the Catholics keep nailing Jesus on the cross and the Protestants keep dragging him off the cross and letting him float off into the air. But as soon as he gets about head high, the Catholics are going to grab him by that foot and put him back on the cross again. All right, and that seems to have been what's come from Christianity while Jesus really doesn't have any influence on Christianity, they're too busy having a magic Jesus. But if they would pay attention to the things that Jesus really said, and some of the stuff that he said is actually quite beautiful. In the chapter of Luke, he says something like, behold, the kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven, is within you. Actually, the Greek, I remember very clearly, is basilica theos. Now, the word basilica is often used as kind of a huge palace of a temple or a big cathedral. You can see the word Catholic in the word cathedral, but some of them are called basilica. I think 4 or 5 of them, one in Rome and one in of Paris. But a Basilica is actually a grand palace. You could say that it's a kingdom, if that palace grounds exceed the entire country. For instance, you could say that in fact Vatican City is a Basilica. It's a grand palace and the grounds around it. And that, that's what we refer to, is, is that something is grand and massive and absolutely exquisitely gorgeous within each one of us. The kingdom of heaven is within you. Now, the next one that he would say, and this one's in Matthew, where he says, behold That same kingdom is at hand. It's right here in front of us. Another one is the word Abba. Jesus used the word Abba, and it is really wrongly translated in English as the word Father. Yes, Deidre, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, and it's not about me, Dhammarato. I see my son joining and I.

**Speaker A:** Haven'T seen him for— Oh, okay. All right. I thought that you were doing that expression with an insight, that the word Abba does not mean father.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, it's just I'm seeing my son for the first time in 4 months.

**Speaker A:** All right, let me give you some words that actually are very close to Abba. That actually point to what the word meant. How about the word about? Abba. And another word would be above. Okay, so what's above and about you is your environment. Behold, the kingdom of God is your environment. It's at hand. Now, uh, in a way, I'm actually using here Spinoza. How many of you have ever heard of Spinoza? Did you ever hear Einstein says that he believes in God, the Spinoza God? Now, Spinoza actually would have said the same thing in the sense that it is nature itself. Well, guess what? Nature is all around you. It's above you, it's about you, and when the quote of Jesus, "Abba and I are one," what that means is he's in unity with his environment. Nothing magical there at all. It's just an ordinary expression that, "Yeah, here I am." right in the middle of everything. But this everything is not all of everything, it's just the local environment. So, uh, Jesus also was quite famous for some of the stuff that he said in, uh, the Sermon on the Mount. We won't go into all of that, but just to say that Jesus, according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, was at least having a whole lot of noble things to say. I remember having a conversation with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa about Jesus, to where we came away kind of disagreeing on the point of where did he get that? Because there's a whole lot of literature that I'm aware of, of how did the teachings of the Buddha ever make it to the Mediterranean. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa held the opinion of it doesn't matter because the Dhamma is everywhere, and Jesus could have figured it out for himself. Let's give him credit for being able to figure out what it was all about all by himself. He didn't have to listen to it second, third, or 19th hand. So that's Bhikkhuni's position, is that it actually Guess what? Neither I nor Bhikkhu Buddhadasa were there, and so we really don't know. But the thing that we did agree on heavily was that the teachings of Jesus was going directly in the direction of the Buddha. What was missing was the practice, the Eightfold Noble Path, except that we know for sure, in some places, especially in the last night, where he was in the Garden of Gethsemane, where he was saying, "Watch with me, watch." Interesting English language word, to watch. And then all of his disciples kept falling asleep, and he'd wake them up and says, "No, come watch with me." All right, now a lot of people would start calling that meditation. Why don't we call it mindfulness instead? That Jesus was actually practicing mindfulness. And there's also the event that he spent 40 days out in the wilderness where he decided that he wasn't going to try to gain magical powers or to, uh, gain ordinary power, through what he did know. He had that conversation with the devil where he says, "Devil, get behind me." I would add a line: "Devil, get behind me and don't push." So, there is a lot of stuff within the basis of Christianity that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was pointing to, in the sense that if Christians would follow their own religion, they wouldn't need to be Buddhist, but what he was really meaning was, is that if people would, the Christians, give up Christianity and start practicing correctly the way that Jesus was trying to teach, including understanding the parables, because the people in the time of Jesus didn't understand the parables, they didn't even know what he was talking about. In a way, he was too far above them. So, if we can see that there is the heart of a religion, and that it's actually kind of easier to see that core, or that Dharma within Hinduism, that in fact one of the big arguments between Hinduism and Buddhism is that Hinduism says there is a self, and that freedom is when the soul merges with Brahma. Have any of you ever heard of that? OK, so, the fact is, is that not just language difference between if you have no self, then you join in with your environment. So in a way, if people would give up their little old egos, give up their little old self, and just be part of nature, then they can find in Hinduism freedom. So there is something valuable and wholesome within every religion It's just in modern times they've lost it. Now, uh, to touch upon and go a little bit further talking about Islam, some of the stuff that Muhammad had to say when he was young, when he was still in Mecca, he actually tried to get his greater family, his extended family to stop trying to make money off the Kaaba, that there was in fact at that time a collection of every religious artifact that they could find from many hundreds of miles around the Kaaba stone. Does anybody know exactly what the Kaaba stone has been found to be? All right, the Kaaba stone was actually a meteorite But it was very large by the time that it had landed. It was about this big. That stone, that black stone, is still, uh, in Mecca, uh, at the mosque. They call the whole mosque, uh, the Kaaba, but in fact it's just a stone. But in the time of Muhammad, there were hundreds and hundreds of idols and statues and everything else, and that Muhammad was trying to get them to see that, oh no, Everything is sacred, everything is holy, not just some rock that fell out of the sky or some statue that somebody carved, that holiness was not within those things, it was within one. However, his family didn't appreciate him trying to put them out of business. They were making a huge fortune there. And they actually, so the story goes, he escaped just in time to prevent them from killing him. And he went to a place called Medina, and he was so well received there that he became the boss. He became powerful. Now, this is all in the Quran and in the Hadith, but the interesting point about it is that the two parts, his time in Medina and his time in Mecca, were reversed in the book. So that the first part of the book is about all the bad stuff that he did in Medina, and the second half of the Quran is all about the good stuff that he did in Mecca. Now, somewhere along the line, they had several old, not rabbis or monks, but mullahs and imams and folks like that, who brought up the point that, oh, isn't it better to follow the last thing that was said, rather than the first thing that was said? And that was in the downfall of Islam. If they had followed what Mohammed had to say when he was young, Islam would then be following their own duty. But in fact, Islam has been turned upside down, so it's just another religion. And one of the hallmarks of religion is— the ordinary religion— is that they hate all the other religions, that they think that my religion is the right religion and your religion is wrong. Why do they do that? Why can't they go and find the collective good within each religion. And you know, there's been several attempts to do that. The Sikhs— I forgot the guy's name— in the late 1600s, he tried to combine in India the Hindus and the Muslims, and he wound up creating a new religion called the Sikhs. Nanu was his name. So there have been others, like the Baha'is, who have tried to take Hinduism and Islam and put them together, and all they wind up doing is getting just another religion, and that new religion hates the two old religions that it came out of, and the two old religions hate the new religion. So the hallmark of religion is hatred. And look at what's happened in the United States. While the Protestants hate the Catholics, the Catholics hate the Protestants, Islam hates the Christians, and everybody hates the Jews. That's a line out of a song. By the way, called National Brotherhood Week, where everybody hates the Jews. Why is that? Why can't religion do what it needs to be doing and get back to its original roots? Now let's talk about Buddhism for just a second. We talked about it already before, earlier today, that many, many people think that Buddhism is is also a religion. I would go so far as to say, yeah, Buddhism is a religion. That's why I wouldn't claim to be Buddhist. But Buddhism is a religion simply because they have all of the other magical stuff. The only thing that I would say that makes Buddhism different from the other religions is that it doesn't hate all the other religions, it snickers at them. But all the other religions, they hate Buddhism. But the teaching of the Buddha and Buddhism are quite different. In fact, you could say that Buddhism is almost all Hinduism, plus some art that came from Tibet and Thailand and Japan and other places like that. So they've changed the art, they've changed the buildings, but they really haven't changed the belief systems. So, let's now look at the duty in general of what a religion is. Why would anybody ever choose a religion? In fact, almost all the religions that the whole world's population have is something that they were born into. Children accept the religion from their parents. Has anybody here, other than changing themselves from one religion to Buddhism, has anybody else stripped up around from one religion to another and stayed there? What I have heard about Islam is that they've got a lot of people who join, but they have even more people who are leaving. Especially those who join. People don't stay in Islam very long. But here's the point about changing a religion, is that you're actually just, let us say, changing one dirty suit for another dirty suit. You still stink. So there's really no reason to change uniforms. There's no reason to do that. This is where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa comes in and says, if we can in fact find the deep core, the real Dharma in each of the religions, of whichever religion that you were born into, then that religion, somewhere in its depths, somewhere in it someplace, you will find the real value of the religion. Now, one of the things that we can say is that not only is everybody born into a religion— and by the way, in this regard, I'm considering atheism as a religion that people are born into. Now, one of the things about atheism as a religion is his ethics. His ethics are based upon secularism, to where other religions are based upon hatred. In other words, the atheists really don't hate anybody, but they're better, well-behaved in general. A good example of that is the statistics that's been taken in the United States over time, and they do it by county. And those counties who are heavily Christian will wind up having a whole lot more people in drug rehab, in prison, domestic violence. Christians are pretty tough people. But those counties that are mostly atheist, they're good, law-abiding people. If I was going to be snide, I'd say that the Republicans are the Christians, and the atheists are the Democrats. They're better well-behaved, but that doesn't get them much votes. So, if we can go to look at the fact that not only was everybody raised in a religion, but we were also raised to feel bad, misbehave, hate those that we don't know, and other things like that. One of the studies that I was familiar with a long time ago was that you put 2- and 3-year-olds together in a daycare center, in mixed races, where you've got a couple of Black kids, you've got a Hispanic, and you've got some white kids, and a Jewish kid, and all of that, they'll play together just fine. But if you wait until those kids are 6 years old and you put them together, they'll be killing each other. Why is that? It's because hatred of the other is something that's trained. Now, certainly it is biological in the sense that we do have the instinct, the territorial instinct, but it depends upon how that instinct manifests itself. And if we are taught To be tribal when we're young, then we will remain tribal all throughout our lives, unless we actually find the actual duty that we have to our religion. Because Jesus wasn't racist, so why are the Christians racist? Why are the Catholics, what's left of them in Europe, hating the Muslims so much? When the Muslims, everybody Islamic in Europe, came to Europe to get away from the Islamic governments that they were in! So that would have been a marvelous opportunity for the Europeans to integrate the Islamic people who were coming in, but instead, they stayed separate. Isolated, and now the governments of Europe are getting pretty heavy. In fact, I've heard that Germany is actually actively closing mosques; that for a while there were districts of Paris that even the French police wouldn't go into, because they were afraid of the Muslims. But guess what? That's all over with now. The police in Europe, and police in Paris, they go wherever they want; they're not afraid of the Muslims anymore. Why is that? Because the Muslims, by and large, have become Frenchified. They're no longer that kind of Islam, they're no longer "I, me, mine, my religion, and we're better than you are," but they're actually becoming integrated. It's just taken so many years to do that. So, here we are, looking at it from the perspective of the teaching of the Buddha, to find that in fact, if we practice the core of our own religion, or if we in fact have made that move out of whatever religion we're in and moved to the teachings of the Buddha, there we are, the core is easily found. And what is that easily found? Well, it's easily found, it's easily seen. In fact, YouTube is full of Buddha literature. Some of it is quite good. The problem is, is that listening to YouTube talks, or even listening to this talk, is not liberating. What is liberating? Practice. Practice. That's what's liberating. We actually have to practice the Eightfold Noble Path. We actually have to practice changing our mind. We have to actively practice changing our hatred, we have to actively practice coming out of our greed, we have to actively practice getting over all of the things that were done wrong to us, we have to actively practice being friendly. And one of the biggest points is that we have to actively practice being friendly to ourselves because we have been our whole lives taught that we ourselves are the other. We criticize ourselves. Yeah, Mommy loved me when I was an infant; by the time I was ready for school, it was, "Hup, 2, 3, 4, you go where you're supposed to go, don't depend upon me, you dress yourself and you do your own ABCs and 123s." And there that critical world was, and every one of you was raised in a critical world by the one, our mother, who was the best shot we had at finding somebody who actually cared for us and nurtured us. Now, one of the jokes that I have heard recently is there's a difference to the way that a mother treats her son and the way she treats her daughter. The way that mother treats her son is, "Oh, you'll be okay, you just go to school and you do the work and everything is going to be all right." But what mom says to the daughter is, "You look fat in that." In other words, it's all criticism. So, the boy is put to work, and the daughter is wound up just having to put up with the criticism. What was that? Go ahead, Dietrich.

**Speaker B:** That's another territory, that the girl needs to be beautiful, needs to be beautiful and attractive to get the right man. That's a really old, but it's a really like a like a hidden transparent belief everybody has almost about the way we look at women and men. So women need to be attractive and men need to be strong to go to work.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Women should be attractive and men should be strong. Men have to take care of women and women have to pay them back by being luscious. Yeah, and that's our society. Well, guess what? I don't know of any religion who doesn't put up with that. But the Buddha, Dharma is quite well with that in the sense of everybody's the same. Hey, gal, shave your head and put on a robe and you're just as good as the guys are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, but in fact, in Thailand, Thailand is mostly Buddhist. Sure, there's a whole lot of followers, by the millions of followers of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but the whole rest of the culture does that same trick of the men have to be strong and the women have to be gorgeous. You're taught like that. But one thing about the time— go ahead, Dietri.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I had another question about what you said before. Is that okay?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was— there is— you talked about all the different, like, religions. So I was wondering, do you consider, like, science Science is also sometimes considered as a religion, because it's like you do a hypothesis and then you try to find a truth for it. But the way you do your research makes a difference.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dammarato] All right, you're correct there. Let us say this, that science actually has two different kinds of people in it. One is those who really enjoy scientific proofs and scientific evidence and they think that science is the But there's a much smaller group who are not interested in what science has found already; they're interested in looking for what it hasn't found yet. And those are the true scientists. The true scientists are those that are looking for the solution, looking for the truth; and there are those who think they already got it. So that's an important point. You could say then, that that's really what the core of a religion should be, is getting people out of thinking that they already know the answers to the questions, and put them into research. But in this case, we're not researching atoms, we're not researching planets, we're not researching chemicals. Well, yes we are, in fact. But the way to look at it is that we're researching our own mind. This is the real practice, is to remember to look at what we're doing. You've heard me say this oh so many times. I make sure that I say it on every talk that we have. The whole point of the teaching of the Buddha is not about knowledge that you'll gain by reading the books. It's about the knowledge that you will see and investigate by looking and reading the book between your ears. But we have to keep doing that, because as I have heard before, it's a jungle in there. It's a thicket, a thicket of views, jungle, ever-changing. Things are constantly going yabber, yabber, yabber, yabber, and there's no end to the things that you have heard your whole life. And we go around repeating that stuff over and over again, rather than actually looking at what value any and everything that we say actually holds. What's the value of that? What's the value about the banker thinking about his bank account? And yet look at how many bankers, they spend their whole day thinking about the bank account. They're watching stocks go up and down and up and down, and there they are with the calculator. Oh, I'm worth $1.3 million now. Oh, wait a minute, I'm worth only $1.2 million, or maybe billion, whatever it is. But people are not really looking at reality. What they're looking at is what they have been told to look at. Yes, Dietrich, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's still, I think it's still okay to do that as long as you enjoy it, as long as you don't make it like that is you, like your ego, but more like not personal, don't take it in, but say that's a game, it's a game about stocks and about money going up and down and I just enjoy doing that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, just enjoy the game, enjoy the show. You've heard my statement about that, that Shakespeare was the one who said that all the world's a stage and each one is a player. And the way that I would add to that is, yes, and everyone that's on that stage has a script that they're reading that was written for them by their parents and their loved ones, and invented when they were a child. And that's who we are. We're standing on a world stage reading our script, and we're not even aware of what's going on. So the first thing we need to do is to pay enough attention to figure out that we're just reading a script. That's all we're doing, we're just reading a script. Why don't we put that script down and look around? And what we will find is everybody else around us is just reading a script. And then what we can do is, we can probably wander off the stage and go and sit in the audience part of the theater, and recognize that there are very few people in the audience, because almost everybody is up on stage. Well, what can you do in the audience? You can just enjoy the show! Don't do anything with having a lot of feelings about it. An example of that is, you know, they had an election in the United States on November the 6th or 7th, and guess what? Nothing has really changed. Nothing has changed. The ones who hated Trump before he was elected, they hate him even more now. So, there's nothing really changing about it. The script remains the same, but what we can do is we can read our own script recognize that it's just a script and start to rewrite that script. If you could change your script, what would you change it to? That's the real question, because now we've got choices about what we're going to put in that script. Before, we didn't have any choice about it. Now we have choices. So, Dietrich, you still have your hand up?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there was one more thing, if you don't mind. I don't want to take too much time. It's the thing about magic, because in the beginning about the religions, there was really a lot about magic. So I think that's also part of the great attraction of being religious or having a religion that you experience because you're with a group and you believe in the same thing, you feel like magic. So do you think the magic is also like in the Dhamma that you find the magic in yourself.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us look at the word magic for just a bit. Now, one of the things that I've seen Ivan post just recently is that if you're watching a magic show and you can really watch it and really see what's going on, you begin to see that it's sleight of hand. It's not magic at all. It's real. But that doesn't stop you from enjoying the show. You don't have to bring the show to a halt. You can just enjoy the show. But now you understand the show because you can see it. Let me tell you this story about it. This was, I think, like 1977 or 1978, and I was on a train and I met an Indian woman on the train. And the train was going to Bangalore, her home. And we got into a conversation that when the train trip ended, she took me home with her. And there, feeding me, she also went to a big stack of pile of newspapers and pulled an old newspaper out to show me an article about Sathya Sai Baba, who was the famous magician of Bangalore at the time. Has anybody ever heard of Sathya Sai Baba? I'm sure that several of you have. Okay, so he was known for several important magic tricks. One was that he kept being able to manifest a Rolex watch, but upon close inspection— and what happened was that the newspapers They started carrying cameras and they started watching, and they'd hold the camera at waist level, they would hold it over their shoulders, and being able to take a whole lot of different photos of him. And that's what this newspaper article was, was a whole lot of photos of him being caught. Now, one of the things that he would do also, by the way, that Rolex was the same Rolex. He kept manifesting the same Rolex, and he would manifest it and wave it in the air and then give it back to the same guy who actually owned the Rolex. And then when it came Magic Time Show, the guy would give, uh, Sai Baba that Rolex again, and then he would wave in the air and he would manifest it in his hand, and then he would give it back to the same guy. And everybody was clapping, 'Oh my goodness, what a great guru he is!' Another trick that he had, and this was actually quite famous because he did this one often, and that was that he would take ash from incense sticks or mosquito coils or whatever, and he would wet it down so that it was kind of like a clay. And then he would roll it into balls about the size of a rice grain, and then he would stuff these rice grains between his fingers on both hands. And then when it was time to have the magic, he would wave his hands, crush the stuff, get it all, and then he would poof and blow it, and it would land on a half a dozen young ladies that were sitting in the audience, and everybody was saying, "Oh, what magic, what magic!" All right? But once you know what he was doing, it's just a magic show, nothing special about it. And this newspaper was quite a display, and it was a major newspaper in Bangalore at the time, and it had been done, I think, like 1972, so this article was 5 years old by the time that I saw it. And guess what? The people on those trains would still come to Bangalore to see his magic because they still believed in it. The people in Bangalore read that newspaper and they still believed him. But I was very grateful to this woman to point out to me what he was doing, so that when I went to actually see him, I knew what was going on. I followed a lot of Indians around for a while until I found Goenka. The one thing that I really appreciated about Goenka was that he was Buddhist. He wasn't showing us magic. All the Hindu saints were Hindu saints and Hindu gurus because they could do magic, and Satchidananda was about the best. So go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and what about like we all talk about becoming in first Jhana? So that can feel like being fully satisfied, being totally focused, really concentrated. That could feel like people call that magic. Maybe it's not the good word, not the right word.

**Speaker A:** It's not the right word for it now, is it? Because those feelings are real. And we created those feelings using a procedure, and you can repeat that procedure. So in a way, you could say that First Jhana is a whole lot closer to science than it is to religion, and especially to magic. But those people who hear the word Jhana and don't know what it is, they will consider it magic.

**Speaker B:** Like Nirvana. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if somebody tells you that, that Jhana is magic, you could just snicker and say, aha, may you practice magic. May you find the first Jhana, and when it becomes real for you, you'll stop believing in it. Gary, go ahead. Jerry, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, isn't the major problem with religion that of authoritarianism? Because you start off with some guy like the Buddha who's got a good idea and people follow him and he says, now, you know, look it up for yourself, look inside your head, see if what I'm telling you is right. But then later on come along a whole lot of people who have also done this. And the great disease of authoritarianism that seems to infect an awful lot of humans clicks in and they have to start telling everybody else what to do and how to do it.

**Speaker A:** All right. That's part of what's happened with Richard.

**Speaker C:** All the people who will follow somebody like Trump because, oh, he's a strongman, or Orban, and all of these guys. Oh, we have to have a strongman too. To sort things out for us. Now, isn't that the problem with religion, that whatever starts off as a good idea promulgated by one man, not necessarily including L. Ron Hubbard or what was it, Smith, the Mormon man, but normally it's some guy who has a good idea and then the authoritarians take over. If authoritarians hadn't taken over Buddhism, you wouldn't have all these wats and statues and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I agree thoroughly. You're completely correct upon that. And I would go so far then as to say, and a very good example of that was Constantine. Constantine decided that he wanted to fix Christianity, to fix it into a solid object, so that he could put it to use on his behalf. I've forgotten the name of the religion, but there was a religion that preceded Christianity. Mithraism, perhaps, was the name of it. Mithraism, yeah. Mithraism, right.

**Speaker C:** I think the one who really is to blame there was actually Theodosius, came later in the 400s sometime, and he as I have read it, he sort of got everything organized in favor of a particular brand of Christianity that believed particular things that other brands didn't believe. And he was sort of actually paying them money and supporting their temples and all that kind of thing. But there you are. I mean, that's what happens. Authority takes over, a bureaucracy comes in. I mean, look at— well, look at all the churches, particularly the Roman Catholic one, right?

**Speaker A:** Especially in the Middle and Dark Ages where they had the divine right of the kings. Okay, so the king ruled divinely. Guess who gave him the word divine to use? The Catholics. And so it was, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, and we'll both stay in power. And will keep everybody else down. Okay, well, isn't that exactly the case that it is with politics currently? That then, uh, when I was a really little kid at church, they all talked about Jesus. Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so, you know, and all of that kind of stuff. But during the 1960s, especially when Nixon got into office, because of the civil rights legislation from the Democrats, Nixon says, let's have a, what he called, Southern policy, a Southern agenda, which nowadays is that all the Christians are all in the Republican Party, because Christianity has now been changed from a religion into a power-hungry mob. But they use the word Christianity, and in fact this is part of the reason why Christianity is actually falling apart in America, is because it doesn't even do its duty as far as a religion would be concerned. Now it's just a political action committee. And this is what happened also to the Catholic Church, especially you talk about the incidents of the altar boys. Now, the altar boys have been altar boys for centuries, in the same way that they were in Boston. They just got caught in Boston, but they've been caught before. What really got them was not that they were caught, but they were caught over and over and over again, and then the people who were catching them got together and started comparing notes. This is where knowledge comes in, vast knowledge. And so, the Catholic Church has lost a lot of its power, because people have figured out that their magic show was designed to steal from them. Steal two things: money and power. Now, the Baptist preachers have had equal problems. They've got two issues: panties and offering plates, and they've got their hands in both of them. Sometimes they get caught, and that's one of the reasons also that Christianity has fallen apart, is because people have begun to see what religion has turned itself into, and that is a power trip. Televangelism was really an interesting thing. Billy Graham was the first televangelist, and he was the only televangelist that never had his own jet airplane. All the other ones got rich enough to start flying around so that they could have more revivals and get even richer. And so that, that whole idea of money is power and power is money has infested Christianity greatly. Guess what? The same thing is true at a, let us say, a much reduced level, and perhaps it's only a matter of time, within Buddhism in Thailand. That a number of monks, in fact several of them are quite famous for riding around in a Mercedes-Benz; they just don't own the Mercedes-Benz. One of their rich followers provides it, as well as a chauffeur. And so that's the kind of power that we have. It's a little bit sneakier here in Thailand, and because it's as sneaky as it is, it doesn't have quite the overt power that everybody can see. But this is the issue that Gary is mentioning, is that what has happened is that the core of Buddhism, or the core of every religion, let us think about it like a walnut, or even better, a Brazil nut. The walnut has a core, and it's got fruit, it's got something delicious in it, but it's also got a shell, and that shell does not necessarily protect the fruit inside it, It's protecting itself. And this is what we have with religions. We have a very, very hard core. Some of that religious core is centuries deep and a very, very hard nut to crack. But there is supposedly, according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, some sort of fruit at the core of every religion. The lucky thing is that there's a whole lot of Buddhist teaching that has the fruit that's just laying around without any core or shell covering it up. And in that regard, the actual noble teachings of the Buddha have been spreading around. Now, one thing that I would like to inform you is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was Thai through and through. He spoke some English, but he was primarily interested in getting the Thai people to actually understand the core of their own religion. And because of that, he became quite famous in Thailand. I would still say that he's the number one best-known monk in all of modern Thai. His photos are common here in South Thailand. There's a huge, huge wat that's worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars just in the land alone in Bangkok. It's so big they've got their own lake. And so Buddhism, or actually the teaching of the Buddha is alive and well in Thailand, with thousands of books being published in Thai language. They still haven't translated— not translated, transcribed all of the stuff that they have. One thing that I would really like to see is that there was a number of letters that went back and forth between Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and his own teacher who was named Bhikkhu Buddhagosujjarn, who was actually a very high-ranking official in Bangkok. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was spotted by this guy who was actually a noble, and he took on Bhikkhuni as his student. And they had letters to go back and forth because Bhikkhuni was in South Thailand and he was in Bangkok. But actually, in I think 1939, Anagami actually came all the way to Wat Suwan Mokk to visit Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. But those letters are kept kind of hidden away. They've never been translated into English. They haven't even been published in Thai, because there's so much other good stuff that is still not published yet. So when you see 30, 40, 50 books of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa translated into English, you say, wow, he was quite prolific. No, he didn't. He hardly wrote a thing. He just ran his mouth, and he ran it long, and he ran it often. Every day he would teach the Dhamma, anybody who would listen. And in fact, at Wat Suwan Mok, and Cat, if you're still on, Do you see Cat? Cat's gone now. He's here? Okay. Cat, if you go over to Wat Soan Mok during some of the day, you will actually hear them broadcasting Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's old tapes down in the front part of the monastery. Is that not right? I never heard it myself because I usually don't go up there too much, to be honest. But that's interesting. Yeah, yeah, I think, uh, from mid-morning through the afternoon they're playing his tapes. Okay, that's all. That's— in fact, that's much of what I remember. I remember the chickens and I remember Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's tapes being played. So, um, The point that I want to make though is that it was Ajahn Po who was extremely interested in Westerners. He wanted to spread the Dhamma not just out in Thailand, but he wanted it spread in the West. This is why you hear me, is because he's put it to me. My duty to the Dhamma is to talk the Dhamma in a language that is understood by you guys. That I don't speak Thai— well, I speak enough Thai to get into trouble— but I don't speak it in the way that they did in the time of the Buddha. That in fact, the suttas, even if they're well translated, they're still hard to read because of all the cultural old stuff that's in there. But one of the things that I have learned is the Dhamma, and now I can speak it in a language that's easily understood. And so that's my job, my happy duty to the Dhamma, is to talk about the Dhamma, to spread the Dhamma, to be able to say it so that people can actually understand the very simple part, that part of the reason why religions are complicated is because they want it to be complicated and hard to be understood by ordinary people. Because if you actually understood Christianity, you would leave Christianity. If you actually understood Islam, you'd leave Islam. They want to make it overly complicated. And all of the stories I've heard, in fact, I've heard a lot of stories about Islam. I was actually, to be honest with you, I spent months and months in Saudi Arabia where I was drilled on it from two different sides. One side was from the Muslims who were there. I had some friends who I worked with, and then when I went home, I lived with a bunch of Westerners who were expats, and they had their own version. And so I got it from both sides. And so Islam is full of magic. One of the magic tricks is, is that there he is in Medina sleeping, and the next thing you know, he's had a dream of going to Jerusalem. And there he either rides a donkey or a horse, depending upon the stories, and goes to heaven. And because he had a dream of breaking a donkey to heaven by going to Jerusalem first, now the Muslims own the Temple Mount. They own that mosque. Why? Because Muhammad had a dream. And off and on it goes and goes and goes, but the one that I find world-class is Christianity. Some dude got himself into trouble by breaking into the temple and driving out the bankers and throwing over the money tables and gets strung up for it, gets nailed to the cross, and the next thing you know, he's a god. Now that's a magic trick. That's a real magic trick that they made Jesus into a god when in fact the best he could do was simple magic tricks. And a whole religion has grown up around not what Jesus said, but what they said about Jesus. And now what have you got? You've got a God and a Son, and then in the Book of Acts they're visited by a wind. They call that the Holy Spirit. The next thing you know, we've got a Trinity. We've got a God that's 3-in-1. Well, when I was a kid, we had shoe polish that was 3-in-1, but they've got that as a religion now. 3-in-1, what a magic show. And not only that, but we have virgins, virgin birth. And after he was nailed to the cross, we've got walking saints. I mean, they say that all the terms were overturned and Jerusalem was full of walking ghosts, but that's just a story. But it's part of their magic show, and the magic show is ridiculous. How can anybody who is an adult can listen to the story of Christianity and believe it? It's just not believable. Dead man walking and no-sex babies is just Crazy! In fact, the doctors will play that trick. The mother brings the daughter in for a medical exam, and the doctor finds the daughter pregnant, and the girl claims that she's never had sex, and mother vouches for her, "She hadn't been out of my sight and hadn't been sexed." And so the doctor walks over to the window and looks out for 5 minutes, And Mom finally says, what are you doing, Doctor? And he says, I'm waiting for it to happen. It happened the first time and I missed it, and I didn't believe it, but I want to see it this time. I want to see that virgin birth this time. What is he doing? He's trying to prove to that daughter, guess what, I know what you've been doing and you won't tell Mommy. All right, that's just a magic show. I haven't had sex and yet I'm pregnant. So, this is what the problem with Christianity is, is that it's so magical, and so angry, that there's nothing to it left. And this is why Christianity is falling apart, left, right, and center, mostly because people have access to the internet, and they begin to see what a ridiculous story Christianity is. But the core is still there. The actual teachings of Jesus are still available, and guess what? They align very closely with the teachings of the Buddha. So that's what I have to say about magic Christians. Another one, by the way, Baptism. I was grabbed at the age of 9 after we and my friends broke into the school and we stole safety patrol belts and some other jarvis that wasn't worth anything and took it down into the woods, and my dad caught us. The next Sunday morning, I was baptized at the church. They thought that baptizing me was going to save me from my sin. Well, it did, because I haven't ever stolen any safety patrol belts from the school since then. That was the last time I did that. But I don't think it had anything to do with the baptism being magical. In fact, the reason why that baptism is so strange is because the kids get baptized on Sunday evening, And by the next Saturday night, they're out boogieing down again. It didn't work. And so, many of them have to get baptized again, maybe a second dose. Take one pill every day for a month and you'll finally get cured, maybe. But that's the problem with Christianity, is that their magical savior doesn't save anybody. That's what's happened, is they say if you rely upon Jesus Christ, thou shalt be saved. And the real version is, if you will do what Jesus instructed you to do, then you've got a chance of being saved. But not wanting him to do it for you— he's been dead for 2,000 years, if he ever existed. And all we have left of Jesus is a bunch of magical stories. Go ahead, Jesus. I'm talking about, you know.

**Speaker D:** The bald version of it. So just to share, just to share something. When I was 8 years old in Spain, we do this, the second dose of the baptism it's called the communion.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Okay, so before the communion, I was in a Catholic school and I said to a friend, like, I don't believe in this. And I was very young, I said, I don't believe in this. And then this friend told to the priest and I got so much trouble, so much trouble, because he says like, Jesus doesn't believe in God. And I was like, okay. Oh, okay. I didn't say anything. And then I remember the priest took me outside and said, what do you believe in? It's like snakes, they don't speak. Snakes, they cannot speak. I was talking about the snakes with Adam and Eve. It's like they don't speak. That's bullshit. I mean, in another way. And yeah, it was a lot of trouble with the people there. I was bullied. When I say that, I was bullied. Months later.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what happened a month later?

**Speaker D:** I was bullied.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker D:** What is the word for when the— when your, your, your schoolmates, they, they treat you bad because you don't believe in God?

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay, same as ostracized or bullied. Bullied is the word you're using. Okay. Uh-huh.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, just to share that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Mikey yesterday was talking about— we were in the conversation about in 1950 when I was in school, every kid was Christian in our town, whatever town that I was in. And he was raised in Tulsa in the year— in the 2000s, and he says, no, most of my friends didn't ever go to school or church. The Christianity is really kind of falling apart. But it depends upon the location that you're in, and it depends upon your age. But the important point is that there's no reason for us to have any bad feelings about religion. Let religion do what religion wants to do, and we can just enjoy the show. We can enjoy their magic show. In fact, you've seen me today talk about the Christian magic show. I love it! So does anybody have anything to say about this? Rick, you've been smiling this whole time. I've really enjoyed watching you. What do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** No, it's just, it's just funny. Um, I just thought it was funny how if you put it in a certain way, like, it's just obviously complete nonsense. And, uh, yeah, I guess that's what we— or I enjoy about Dhamma, is that it's very tangible, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. It's practicable. It's available herein and now. That's what's so brilliant about the teaching of the Buddha, is that it can be seen and practiced in the here and now. So, Luke, go ahead, Rick.

**Speaker E:** No, I just said yes, I agree with you. It's really nice.

**Speaker A:** All right, Luke, what do you have to say? Anything? How about you, Ben? Go ahead, Luke, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, no, that's all right.

**Speaker A:** No, no. Not a huge amount. I wasn't brought up Christian, so I don't really have an opinion on it, but an interesting talk. Thank you. All right, well, hopefully this interesting talk is not just interesting, it is a call to practice. Let this be a call to practice, because you can get over whatever religion you were raised in and find a happy life. Go visit Kat, he'll show you the way. So Ben, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** No, nothing to say, Dhammarato. Thank you. I've not got any religious leanings myself, but it was an interesting talk.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, Ivan.

**Speaker C:** Not much.

**Speaker A:** Not much, nothing to say. Nothing to say. Anna, how about you? Anything to say?

**Speaker B:** Well, thank you, Dhammarato, for this talk, and thank you all. That was nice to hang out with you.

**Speaker A:** Carl, how about you? You have anything to say? Well, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home then? He's got to be a big announcement. Make your announcement.

**Speaker F:** Thank you all for coming to church today. My view is hurting. We hope you enjoyed the sermon. Now, this is an excellent Dhamma talk, very much enjoyed it. And if you haven't, go ahead and check out the Sangha US Skype group and listen to yesterday's talk that goes very much so hand in hand with this one. Our good friend Koby has significantly made a big improvement speeding up the website, so please go check out opensanghafoundation.org. What we would like to see is more and more people using that for communicating and participating in Sangha and sharing Dharma content rather than using the Discords and the Skype groups so much. We'll still be meeting here for video calls, but you know, if you can, you want to share something, some sort of long piece of text, you can share it as a blog. If you want to chat in a group, we have a Sangha group on Open Sangha Foundation. You can share suttas on the Suttas page, and there's all sorts of other.

**Speaker A:** Cool features on the video page. Yes, we've got various pages instead of just putting it all in stream the way that we have been. And not only that, but if you send a message or a post or whatever, then it will actually go out as an email for those who haven't seen it. And that will help unify the group. Instead of having to load Skype to see what's happened, all you need to do is just click on that link that you see in the email. So I highly recommend that you take Mikey's advice. Go ahead, Mikey.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and I was also just going to say, if you find something on opensanghafoundation.org or you write something there, feel free to share it on any platforms that you're involved with or with any friends. Out there. So yeah, thank you so much everyone for being here today. It's great to see so many smiling faces and good friends keep on coming back to these Dhamma calls.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much, Mikey. Good to see everybody. Thank you so much. So we can start using the Open Sangha Foundation. It's fast now, it loads within a second. To be honest with you, the problem was that we were loading all of the Google fonts. And Google's got thousands of fonts, and some of them are pictures, like Santa Claus costume alphabets and things like this. And so, it was taking nearly 9 seconds to load, and so we've taken that 9 seconds off And so it's very fast now, usable. And in that regard, that means that it's a big site. It's got so much stuff to it. So go read the frequently asked questions, go read the suttas, go look at the videos, go look at the library that we have. Got a huge library. We've also got huge amounts of places, nearly 6,000. So go to the search engine and find places close to you, or go look for them in Timbuktu. It doesn't matter, there's places all over. And if you know of a place that's not on our website, add it, because we've got a page where you can add places. All right, well, thank you guys very much. And we'll see you on OSF.

**Speaker D:** Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** You just loaded it there, Arahant.

**Speaker E:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Alrighty, see you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, centers on a critical yet compassionate examination of organized religion, contrasting it with the core, practical teachings of the Buddha. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: The "Duty" of Religion vs. Its Current State**
Dhammarato begins by stating that religions have a core "duty": to provide a genuine path to freedom and understanding for their followers. He references Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's view that people should find this freedom within the religion of their birth. However, Dhammarato observes that modern religions have largely failed this duty, becoming corrupted by power, politics, and "magical" beliefs, leading to sectarian hatred.

### **Analysis of Major Religions**
*   **Christianity:** The talk suggests that the original teachings of Jesus (e.g., "the kingdom of God is within you," his emphasis on mindfulness) pointed toward universal truths aligned with the Dhamma. However, institutional Christianity has ignored this core in favor of magical narratives (virgin birth, resurrection, Trinity) and political power, leading to its decline.
*   **Islam:** A similar pattern is noted. The early, more universal teachings of Muhammad in Mecca (that holiness is within, not in idols) were subverted by later political and militaristic developments in Medina. The religion's focus shifted, turning it into another divisive institution.
*   **Hinduism & Others:** The core wisdom in Hinduism (merging the self with Brahman) is acknowledged, but it, too, is often obscured by ritual and dogma. The talk notes that attempts to synthesize religions (e.g., Sikhism, Baha'i) often just create new sects that inherit the old problem of exclusivity and hatred.

### **The Problem: Authoritarianism, Magic, and Hatred**
The speaker identifies key flaws in institutional religion:
1.  **Authoritarianism & Bureaucracy:** Good initial teachings get hijacked by structures seeking power, money, and control (e.g., the Catholic Church's history, televangelists).
2.  **"Magic" Over Practice:** Religions promote supernatural beliefs (miracles, divine intervention) instead of a practicable path. These are likened to a "magic show" that distracts from the real work.
3.  **Tribalism and Hatred:** Religions often foster in-group/out-group mentalities and hatred of "the other," which is a learned behavior contradicting their own foundational ethics.

### **Buddhism's Position**
Dhammarato makes a crucial distinction:
*   **"Buddhism" as a Religion:** He agrees that institutional **Buddhism**, with its rituals, art, and cultural baggage, can fall into the same traps as other religions (e.g., monks with wealthy patrons).
*   **The Dhamma (Teachings of the Buddha):** This is separate. The Dhamma is the **practicable core**—like the nourishing fruit inside a hard nut. It is not about belief but about **practice**: the Eightfold Path, mindfulness, and self-investigation.

### **The Solution: Personal Practice and Perspective**
1.  **Practice is Essential:** Liberation doesn't come from listening to talks (including this one) but from **actively practicing** the path: changing one's mind, letting go of greed and hatred, and cultivating friendliness, especially towards oneself.
2.  **See the "Script":** We are conditioned to live by a "script" given by family and society. The first step is to become aware of this script. Then, we can choose to rewrite it with wisdom and kindness.
3.  **Adopt an Audience Perspective:** Instead of being entangled in the drama on the world's stage, one can learn to "sit in the audience" and **enjoy the show** without hatred or agitation, applying this to politics and religious conflicts alike.
4.  **Find the Core in Any Tradition:** While the Dhamma offers the most accessible and magic-free path, one could theoretically find freedom by practicing the deepest, most authentic core of their birth religion—if they can strip away the corruptions.

### **Conclusion & Practical Directive**
The talk concludes by emphasizing that the Dhamma is **tangible, here-and-now, and practice-oriented**. It is a call to move beyond religious dogma and sectarianism. The final administrative note encourages the community to use the newly improved **Open Sangha Foundation website** as a hub for sharing resources and connecting, reinforcing the theme of moving toward practical, shared practice over institutional forms.

**In essence, the talk is a critique of religious institutions for abandoning their liberating core in favor of power and magic, while championing the Buddha's Dhamma as a clear, practical, and non-sectarian path to freedom that requires personal effort, not belief.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to critique organized religion and illustrate the core, practical teachings he advocates for. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**

1.  **Religion as a Dying Grandfather:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Description:** Organized religion is compared to a "bad grandfather" on his deathbed. The question is whether to hate him for past wrongs or to show compassion at the end, acknowledging his past role before "happily watch[ing] it die."
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that we should acknowledge religion's historical role but not cling to its outdated, institutionalized forms.

2.  **Religion as a Dirty Suit:**
    *   **Description:** Switching from one religion to another is "changing one dirty suit for another dirty suit. You still stink."
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that the problem isn't the label (Christianity, Buddhism, etc.) but the underlying, unexamined mindset. The solution is internal change, not external conversion.

3.  **Religion as a Walnut/Brazil Nut:**
    *   **Description:** Every religion has a hard, protective shell (institutions, dogma, magic) and a precious fruit or core (the essential, liberating truth or "Dhamma").
    *   **Purpose:** To suggest that the goal is to crack the hard shell of dogma to find the universal, wholesome core within any tradition.

4.  **Life as a Stage/Script:**
    *   **Description:** Expanding on Shakespeare, the speaker says we are all actors on a stage "reading a script that was written for them by their parents and their loved ones." Enlightenment is realizing you're reading a script, putting it down, and eventually rewriting it yourself.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how our conditioning and beliefs are pre-programmed, and that freedom comes from mindful awareness and consciously choosing our actions.

5.  **The Mind as a Jungle/Thicket:**
    *   **Description:** The untrained mind is "a jungle in there. It's a thicket of views... ever-changing."
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize why active, investigative practice (not just belief) is necessary to navigate the confusion of our own thoughts.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The "Magic" of Sathya Sai Baba:**
    *   **Description:** The speaker recounts a story from 1970s India about the famous guru. He details how Sai Baba's "miracles" (manifesting a Rolex, producing sacred ash) were exposed by newspaper photographers as sleight-of-hand tricks.
    *   **Purpose:** To demystify "magic" in religion. Even when the trick is revealed, people still believe. The point is to see the "magic show" for what it is and enjoy it as a show, not base your faith on it.

2.  **The Evolution of Islam (Mecca vs. Medina):**
    *   **Description:** The speaker summarizes the story of Prophet Muhammad, contrasting his early, spiritual teachings in Mecca (where he said everything is sacred) with his later, political leadership in Medina. He notes that the Quran is arranged with the later Medinan surahs first, which he sees as a corruption of the original message.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that religions often betray their original, wholesome core ("duty") for power and politics.

3.  **The Doctor and the Virgin Birth:**
    *   **Description:** A humorous anecdote about a doctor confronted with a pregnant teenager and her mother who both insist on a virgin birth. The doctor stares out the window, and when asked why, says he's waiting to see it happen this time since he missed it the first time.
    *   **Purpose:** To ridicule the literal, magical interpretation of religious stories (specifically in Christianity) and point out their absurdity when examined rationally.

4.  **Personal Baptism Story:**
    *   **Description:** The speaker shares that he was baptized at age 9 after being caught stealing. He notes it didn't have a magical effect but was a social response, and that many kids get baptized repeatedly because it doesn't change behavior.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that ritual without understanding and personal practice is ineffective ("their magical savior doesn't save anybody").

5.  **Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane:**
    *   **Description:** The speaker reframes Jesus's command to his disciples to "watch with me" as an instruction in **mindfulness**, not just passive waiting.
    *   **Purpose:** To find the core, practical "Dhamma" within Christianity, aligning Jesus's teachings with Buddhist practice.

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose**
The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to draw a sharp contrast between:
*   **Organized Religion:** Portrayed as authoritarian, magical, divisive ("hallmark of religion is hatred"), power-hungry, and dying.
*   **The Core Teaching/Dhamma:** Portrayed as practical, universal, non-magical, investigatable (like science), focused on internal practice (mindfulness, the Eightfold Path), and accessible within or beyond any religious label.

His goal is to steer listeners away from dogmatic belief and toward personal, experiential practice.
