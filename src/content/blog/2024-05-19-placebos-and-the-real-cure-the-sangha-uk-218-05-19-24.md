### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome to the Sunday afternoon Sangha. This is May 19th, and this is for people in Asia and also in the UK. It's middle of the night in the US, but if you're in the US, it's okay for you to be up. So Ivan is in Malaysia, and Jonas is in Germany, and Michael is here on the porch, and David's only about 2 kilometers from here. And Amrit, are you still in India? Are you back in the UK now? Actually, I'm in Berlin now. You're in Berlin? Okay. All right, so to get started, David had a follow-up question from last week when he was talking about ceremony, specifically the water ceremony. So David, have you seen that water ceremony actually performed?

**Speaker B:** The transferring merits to dead ancestors, I see that one every day.

**Speaker A:** All right, who's doing that?

**Speaker B:** The monk here, or both of the monks do it here.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and describe the equipment that they're using.

**Speaker B:** It's the lay people who use the equipment. They have sometimes just a cup of.

**Speaker A:** Water and a bowl.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes it's a fancy cup, like gold, looks like a gold cup and a gold bowl, but sometimes it's just a water bottle and a plastic bowl.

**Speaker A:** Now that's the first one. I've never seen it done with just opening a bottle of water from 7-Eleven and pouring that.

**Speaker B:** That's common, actually. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And what about, uh, uh, the chanting? Do you know what they're chanting?

**Speaker B:** Uh, so it's a blessing, uh, like— Yes.

**Speaker A:** Do you know what it is? Have you heard it? In fact, is it the same one every time, or is it different?

**Speaker B:** There's a shorter version and then a longer version.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right? Do you, would you believe that that generally comes from a particular Sutta, perhaps like a Metta Sutta?

**Speaker B:** Metta Sutta. It sounds like it would come from something like that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** I don't know the particular Sutta.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right. So what is your question about it?

**Speaker B:** Um, I guess since this ritual has nothing to do with the Buddhist teaching, right, right, then why then are the monks doing this? And then you answered, because the Thai people want it anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Thai people want it. So they even pay the monks to do it by feeding them, etc. Sometimes they give a little money in an envelope, right? Yeah. So is it the same lay people over and over again, or is it a new batch that comes in every day?

**Speaker B:** It's usually the same lay people over and over again, but sometimes we get new lay people that only donate like once in a moon.

**Speaker A:** All right, one of the interesting things is that Wat Khao Tom is so remote that not very many lay people go there. For instance, in the mornings you'll find hundreds of people over here at Wat Pho. But at Wat Khao Tom, it's going to be a dozen at best.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's very rare that Thai people come here. It's mostly foreigners coming in to see the view.

**Speaker A:** All right, so the water ceremony is a Thai tradition. I have not seen it anywhere else, but other countries have different ceremonies that are similar to that. That in fact one of the similarities would be instead of pouring water into a bowl while it's being blessed, one of the things that the word for it is shaktipat. And the word shaktipat is used in India, is used in Thailand, and in fact the place that I saw it happen most often was in Cambodian temples. Bowls. Now, Shaktipat is when you take— when the monk takes the water out of the bowl that he's prepared and splashes it on people with a brush. Now, the brush is a very soft brush. It's not one that has bristles. It's one that would be like, oh, a horsetail, which is very soft, long hair. And so it— the horsehair brush will in fact gather up a whole lot of water, so you can do a whole lot of splashing with one brush, hit 10, 15 people, and then put the water back, or put the brush back in the bowl. And it's almost always done in a ceremonial situation. But I've seen them splash cars with it, and it's probably the same chant that's on for either the pouring of the water into the bowl or splashing it all over the people. Generally in the bowl, when it's put into the bowl, it doesn't really matter so much about the water. But in India, yeah, in India, especially with Muktananda, when I first was introduced with it, they would crush roses. Fresh roses, they would take and crush them, get them down to as fine a little thing as they could, and put that in the water so that when the Shaktipat is going on, especially if it's a crowd of people sitting in an audience, then the whole place fills with the aroma of the rose petals. Also in Cambodia, because they drop candle wax in the bowl before it's being spread, It stinks with burnt candle wax. But the point is that it's got a kind of an odor to it. And that your question would be, since this is Thai culture for the water going into a bowl, or it's both Indian and Cambodian. I've seen it also done in Laos, at Lao monasteries, the Shaktipat. And that's also not the teachings of the Buddha. That in fact, in the time of the Buddha, there were very few ceremonies. That when the monks chanted, they chanted in their own native language, and they chanted in order to remember the teachings of the Buddha and to teach the students those chants so that they would understand the teachings of the Buddha. And the style was used so that the chants they may not quite understand, but they at least have memorized it, and then part of their education for the teacher to go into detail about what that sutta means. So the question then is Why do they do it if it's not the teaching of the Buddha? Michael, go ahead. Yes, the monks start chanting. Was it still— did you speak up? When did the monks start chanting? During the lifetime of the Buddha. During the lifetime of the Buddha, they started chanting in a way of teaching the Dhamma. Now the chanting is not so necessary because especially Westerners are going to read the books anyway, and they're going to read it in their native language rather than having to learn the Pali, chant, and then try to figure out what the Pali means. And then from the translation of the Pali to figure out what the Dharma means. And so in fact, the chanting is not as useful as just hearing the Dharma. But you will learn the Dharma a whole lot better if you start memorizing it and remembering it. Part of the example, you've heard me for instance mention in the Pali all of the steps of Piti��casamuppada, and I use a lot of the Pali terms. Also, there's a lot of numbers. For instance, the Five Hindrances, Twelve Steps of Paticcasamuppada, Twelve Steps of Dependent Origination, Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Noble Path, Sixteen Steps to Bhavana, Anapanasati, Four Foundations of Mindfulness, Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the list goes on and on. There's even 36 different kinds of feelings. Then there's 108 when you multiply that by 6. So this is in fact part of the reason that the number 108 especially in Mahayana, is a magical number. It's because it's 6 times 6 times 3, and so it has a meaning to it. The number 20 is also a kind of a magical number in the Pali, and in the— because of It takes 20 monks to do an ordination correctly. It takes 20 monks to bless a new temple. It takes 20 monks to do a Sangha dissesa trial. It takes 20 years for a guy to be old enough to become a Bhikkhu. So these numbers, you could say, are magical. Now, actually a better way of realizing it though, is to understand that these numbers themselves are not magical, they're just traditional. And the water pouring ceremony is not quite as magical as it is traditional. So that water pouring ceremony was part of the original animus that was in Tainan before Buddhism came here. The other signs, I mean, the animism of Tainan, there's not a whole lot left of it. Spirit houses, sacred trees, and this water ceremony that's based around Songkran, which is the water festival, and is also the New Year's, and it's planting season. And Thailand is very rich in water, so you can understand that they're going to keep the water ceremonies Even though real Buddhism has come to Thailand, most of the lay people still like these ceremonies. Now, you mentioned before we started the call, the issue about a placebo. Actually, the scientists have run across placebos, and you could think, in fact, that Buddhism and the practice, the real practice of becoming noble, the real understanding of the teaching of the Buddha is a placebo-like thing. Now, they have come to understand that in general, placebos are effective at about 28% of the time, not quite a third. And so they have to factor this in when they're doing blind studies when they're trying to test a new pill. When I say a double-blind study, that means that even the people who are administering the medicine don't know, and the people who are getting the medicine don't know whether this is a real pill that they're testing or a placebo. And they're trying to factor out whether the real pill does real work or whether it's just merely a placebo. And we can go so far as to say then that much of the teaching of the Buddha is effective because it's a placebo. People get benefit out of it. For instance, people who go and meditate and do the Mahasi method and do the noting and the noting and the noting and the noting, they get some benefit out of that. It's a placebo, and they feel like that they're doing the practice of the Buddha correctly, and they feel really good for it, but it's not completely liberating. And so the people who are doing those water ceremonies, they feel good about it. But in Bangkok, one of the things that I saw commonly is anytime that a guy buys a new car, he's going to take it to the wat Or even better still, have the monk, a senior monk with maybe a couple of extra monks, come to his house and take a kind of powder that they make a paste with. Have you ever seen that powder that they use at Songkran? Michael, have you seen it? Have you seen the Thai people with powder all over their face? It's kind of like a talcum powder. And that the monks will take it and mix it with a little water and then draw these funny symbols that wind up being abstract art. That in fact, one of the abstract arts— you've probably seen that in Thailand— that it actually looks like a sitting Buddha. But they draw a circle and then they come around with the body like this, and it comes back up looking like a Buddha statue. It reminds me of Picasso's art when he was sitting at supper one time and somebody obnoxiously came up and told him, please do me a drawing. And so he took the pencil and paper and it was like that and handed it back to them. And it's now a world-famous Picasso, and it looks like Don Quixote. That's the name of this art. Okay, so the monks will do that kind of art. They'll do squiggly kind of stuff while they're chanting. And the Thai people love it because their car is blessed now, which means it's going to get better gas mileage. They don't have to put oil in it. They don't have to buy insurance because that car has been blessed by the monks. That's the placebo effect. They feel really good about it. They also come and bless the house. I've seen monks bless bank vaults. Believe me, that's not a joke. I've seen monks bless bank vaults doing these strictly white powder drawings on the bank vault while they're doing the chanting. So here's a question for you: do the monks who do these drawings believe it? Do they believe that it's magical? In other words, is this a double-blind study, or do the people who were administering this medicine, do they know that it's a placebo?

**Speaker B:** It's hard for me to know without asking them that, but my guess— all.

**Speaker A:** Right, well, here's the guess that you can use, is that if they are noble then they know that this is a placebo, and that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was the kind of monk that because he knew that it was a placebo, he would not do it. That in fact, the same point then, as you can say, is that there are other placebos. Here's one that is very popular: Oh, well, even if you don't become enlightened, in this whole life. You'll die and you'll get a better place, because you've been spending time with the monks, that placebo, your belief system, then will create a Pure Land or a Paradise, so that when after you die, you'll be reborn in that kind of a heaven, and then you can practice the Dharma and get great benefit out of it. This is sometimes referred to as rebirth. Birth. So actually, the teachings of rebirth is a kind of placebo. But now remember that placebos are not liberating, that in fact, the placebo can get in the way of the liberation, because the people would rather have the placebo than the real medicine. They would rather have the placebo than the real medicine. That's why you will find it so common that people believe in this water pouring, they believe in Songkran, they believe in spirit houses, they believe in all of this animism that's basically been incorporated into the Buddhist religion. So the Buddhist religion in Thailand has a lot of placebos built into it. And Westerners come by, they don't call it placebo, they call it magical thinking. Well, guess what? Magical thinking is a kind of placebo, isn't it? Now let's talk about placebos a little bit. I've already mentioned that in the pill form, the placebos work at about 28%. But you can raise that percentage really well. But meanwhile, before I talk about that, let me give Jonas— you got your hand up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just, I just wanted to make sure that I understand correctly what you mean when you refer to liberation. Like to get that right for me, because I think for me it's such a loaded term. It has been used in many contexts and I just wanted to get to know what you mean by it.

**Speaker A:** Real liberation. Okay. Real liberation has the quality of dropping all of one's defilements and learning through experience, learning through skill development, and learning. We are eventually able to control our attitude and control our feelings. So when you can control your attitude and control your feelings and drop your defilements, drop your hindrances, then that's what we mean by liberation. Okay, and it takes direct knowledge to be able to see those defilements so that you can drop them one by one as you see them arise. Now that's only a partial answer, that in fact with the— a better way of talking about it is that it's got conditions of the mind, and we will need to go through the Sambujana and the Paticcasamuppada and other things like that for you to get a clear understanding. And right now we're not talking about that, but what we are using is referring to as liberation. The Pali word is moksha, okay, giving the word Suan Mok, the Garden of Liberation. So what that actually means is, is that you're free from all your bad feelings, you're free from your bad attitudes, you're free from the hindrances. That enlightenment means that you lighten up because you throw down all your baggage. It's not a magical term. However, the word enlightenment for everybody except the nobles, it's a placebo. It's a magical thinking, because the enlightenment is way out there, so far, so high away. Rather than immediately available. Okay, so let's go back and talk about the placebos for a little while. They have been able in scientific research to be able to increase that percentage from about 28% to maybe as high as 45, 46, in the high 40s. And this is how they do it. They say that all this medicine that we're testing requires an IV, and you've got to come into the hospital and get hooked up to all of our equipment and spend a couple of days in the hospital, and we're going to put this magical shoe juice in you and you're going to feel a whole lot better. And then what do they put in that drip? Saline solution, like they put in everybody, right? No medicines there. But because they go through all of the process of hooking you up and making you stay in a hospital bed for several days, the placebo effect of that saline solution that they put in your vein goes up to about 45%. A lot of people, as soon as they get in the hospital, they won't ride back out. People who are going, oh, I'm so sick, doctor, oh, help me out, oh, I need to be hospitalized, oh, and here's your bed. And as soon as they put you in the bed, oh, I feel better, I want out of here. So even a hospital bed is a placebo. And most of the stuff that monks do, ceremonial, for the lay people, an example of that would be at Wat Suwan Mok, there is a large contingency of lay followers, mostly old women, who will sit and chant in Thai language, while the monks eat food. And they feel a whole lot better because they're coming to the temple and doing their chanting while the monks eat food. It's a placebo, and it works at a fairly high level. That in fact, the 28% that are the 45% to get benefit of that are the ones who keep coming back. And those who it fails as a placebo They don't come back to the temple. And that's why you have only a few coming to the temple, is because they believe that they're going to get benefit out of sitting and chanting while the monks eat food. This is why people do come to the wat. The Asians who come to the wat on a regular basis get great benefit out of it because they made that stuff up. That's the placebo effect. So, this water ceremony is a kind of placebo effect, and it has a great deal of value for those who want that service. Meditation is a placebo for a whole lot of Westerners. It's not real medicine, but it'll do a whole lot of people. This is why the percentage of real nobles is so small, is because so many ordinary people get enough benefit out of the ceremonies and the visiting to the monks, and having a monk come to their house and bless it and draw drawings on the bank vault. I mean, the bank manager is going to get a great deal of security knowing that his bank vault's been blessed by the monks. And so that's good enough for him. And so this is actually— you could think of it in the way of when religion works, it's a wonderful placebo. Unfortunately, there has been so much politics and other things introduced into Christianity over the years that a lot of the placebo effect doesn't work at all. And so they keep going and keep hoping, but not get any real benefit out of it. Another one, another case— Ivan, you may be interested in this one— doing the prayer rituals 5 times a day in the Islamic communities is a placebo. And they go into there and they spend 15 minutes and they bow and they raise and they bow and they raise, and then they stand up and kneel down down and they pray, and then they come back up and they feel really good for that 15 minutes. It's a nice break. It's better than a coffee break. And in business world, even a coffee break is a placebo, and people will take that placebo and they'll feel better. So what is the real deal that Jonas is actually talking about? And this is also going into what Amrit was talking about and that is that when we feel good through the placebo effect, what that means is for a little while, momentarily, because we're feeling good because of the placebo effect, the hindrances are at abeyance. The hindrances have gone away because the people are too busy feeling really good because they're getting some value from the ceremony. And so they feel good when they come to the Wat, and they are out of their misery. So, that is not the real teaching of the Buddha though. The real teaching of the Buddha has to do with practicing over and over again. The practice is practice. Just like learning to play a musical instrument, it takes practice. And you can tell somebody who has not practiced when they're playing a musical instrument. It doesn't sound much like music, now does it? But when you practice and practice and practice over and over and over again, and now you're doing the real job, you're taking the real medicine, doing the real deal for the elimination of the hindrances, every time the hindrance comes up and you see it, you throw it out. Every time you see the hindrance, you throw it out. Now, this has got two qualities to it. One is every time you see the hindrance, that's there the Eightfold Noble Path, because you have to remember to look. And when you do look and you see that this is a hindrance, then you've got to throw it out, you've got to make that change. Now, there's an extra ingredient in there, is that when you see that this is a hindrance and throw it out, then you can congratulate yourself. You can add a little bit of placebo in there too, just to help things along. "Wow, I feel good because I've gotten rid of that hindrance." And so the placebo effect is going to be useful even in the state of becoming noble. But when all we've got is placebo, all we're going to have is short-term good feelings. For instance, that bank manager who had his vault blessed, when money starts missing from the bank vault, he's going to forget all about the fact that the monks were there blessing it. The reality is, is that money's missing, and he's more interested in recognizing that the money is getting missing and who did And he is saying, 'Oh, it must be some mistake. The money is all there because the monk there blessed it, remember? So there's no money missing. It's probably around someplace.' The fact is, is that the money's short, okay? And so the blessing didn't work permanently. We're looking for something that's more substantial. This is where the Eightfold Noble Path comes in, Jonas, and this is when we have to start practicing to see these things as hindrances and then come out of it. Now, Amrit, here's something you mentioned before and said that you'd heard it from Goenka and equated anger with the hindrances. Guess what? Anger is not a hindrance. It's what the hindered mind does when it stays hindered. So anger is not the hindrance itself. What we actually have to do is go a little deeper and recognize that what's really the hindrance is one or more of the other things. For instance, The word that they use is ill will. I don't know why they use that word. That's an 18th century word. I guess they got it from Riles Davies or I.B. Horner, but that word has been stuck. But basically what it means is that we don't like it. And it also has the feeling of a sense of loss. And so, when we don't like something and we have the feeling of a sense of loss that we don't like, anger then comes up as a cure for that feeling of fear and sense of loss and the sense of not liking it. Okay, so here's a kind of question for each one of you: Have you ever been angry? Have you ever been really ticked off and in a rage? Do you recognize that when you get angry and are in a rage, that means then that you feel a certain kind of power? You're ready to fight. This is one of the reasons why people like anger and will choose anger, is because that feeling of power— I'm going to do something about this, I'm going to strangle that dude— is a whole lot better feeling than people like that feeling of power. Rather than the alternate, which is the fear and the sense of loss. Oh, poor me, he did me in. And we don't like that feeling. We don't like being had. We want revenge. Because that feeling of revenge then gives us power, it gives us strength. I see, Ivan, you're shaking your head. How about you? Michael, have you understand that the sense of revenge is actually a powerful feeling, that we want to get even, and that that sense of revenge is also part of where the anger comes from and the power of the anger, that in fact that's what the adrenaline is all about? When the adrenaline comes into the system It's because there is fear, there is disliking, there is that sense of loss, and that we need to do something about it. Like we either need to run away, or we need to confront it and fight it. However, the noble, when he sees this feeling of a sense of loss, when he sees this fear, He's going to say, "Look at that, I feel afraid. Let me take a few deep breaths and I'll feel better. I don't have to go get angry and beat somebody the tar out of them. I can just sit here and breathe well, and let that feeling of despair, that feeling of loss subside, and I don't have to go into a state of anger." And in fact, this issue of anger is one of the things that we can have as an meter or a yardstick or a milepost in the sense of how long has it been. Start keeping track of the times when you get pissed off, when you get angry, when you don't like something enough to where you're going to go do something about it. Start keeping track of those times so that we're going to start marking the interval between how long it's been.

**Speaker C:** For.

**Speaker A:** Instance, since you've raised your voice, how long has it been since you really wanted to strangle someone? You wanted to set them straight. To be honest with you, every time I reread it, I want to strangle somebody. Carl, you got your hand up. Go ahead. I see your microphone is not muted, but I don't hear you. Straighten it out and interrupt us. And go ahead, Anurag, you've got your hand up too. Yes, so I think then what you say hindrance is not liking something and feeling of loss. So this is a hindrance. And then hindrance is the anger is like a distorted view, right? Well, anger is our personal response to the hindrance of being— in other words, we're wanting to get ourselves back into a state of homeostasis. And so anger is the solution for most ordinary people. Rather than getting rid of the anger directly. You've heard me talk about the direct path, the straight path, the path of the Buddha, means to go right to the real problem and fix it, rather than go around. An example of that is, the guy feels lost, he feels a sense of not well-being, and so he has the idea, "Oh, I need a girl, and if I get a girl, I'll feel better." Then he says, oh, I have trouble getting a girl. I'm going to tell you what, I'm going to go buy a chick magnet. I'm going to go get a rocket pocket, a pocket rocket. I'm going to go get a Mercedes, uh, two-seater. I'm going to go get a chick magnet, and then I'll feel better because I've got the chick magnet, which is surely going to get a chick for me. And when I get the chick, then I'll really feel good. You see all of that placebo stuff going on in there? And in fact, when you buy that pocket rocket, all you get is a mortgage. All you get is car payments. Chicks are not guaranteed to come with the car, though that's highly promoted in our society. If you want to get a girl, you got to get a house. Cars are not enough. That's what's in the Thai society. That's really true in Chinese society. You guys got to have a job, he's got to have a house, and then he's going to attract the girl. In the US, you got to have a car. But the point is, is that if you're a sweet guy, if you're wonderful to be around, the chicks are going to come on their own. You don't need the car, you don't need the house. Those are placebos. Okay, Jonas, you got your hand up, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Well, I just wanted to mention that I think many, if not all of the hindrances, I think for me, they somehow come down to, I am dissatisfied with this current moment. When in fact I can just like take a deep breath and then things are really not that bad that I thought they are.

**Speaker A:** That's correct. That's the direct path. That's the path of the Buddha, is that you don't need the placebo. What you need is the cure. And what is the cure? Is to throw out those hindrances. This is why I'm saying, Emre, that anger itself is not A hindrance is the cure, the ignorant cure for the hindrance. Just like buying a car is the cure for not having a girl, and having a girl is the cure for not feeling loved. And in fact, we don't really need love. When you come to the point of saying, "Hey, I'm already okay, I don't need to be loved." then you don't need the girl, you don't need the car, you don't need the house. You're already okay. And so going directly from not okay into getting the car, getting the house, and getting the girl, and then feeling okay— let's just go directly to, I'm okay. Or in the question that you have, I feel a sense of loss, let me get angry and strangle that guy, and then I'll feel better. No, you might be sitting in prison, and you're not going to feel good for long when they catch you for doing the guy in. But sometimes we get really angry because we feel that they did us wrong, and really the one who does us wrong is our own mind. So they could say anything that they want to on Reddit, and when I don't like it, just because I don't like it, it's me, rather than recognizing that, hey, they're just shooting darts. They don't have a clue where the dartboard is. And so I got to stand up and be their dartboard so that they can hit me with a dart? I don't think so. I think the best thing to do is sort of hide. They can't hit me if they can't find me. So the only reason that I would ever really get angry at the guys on Reddit is because I feel that they got me, they hit me. And so we don't get angry. We can tell there's no reason to get angry. And in fact, let's look at that feeling of gotten hit, the feeling of loss, the feeling of getting wounded. And recognize that, hey, they didn't wound me, I did. The I in me that did it. Yes, Jonas, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** I have a question about kind of the other side, not when I'm angry, kind of when I'm angry, I know that something is wrong. But what about the other side when, for example, I'm extremely happy because someone is giving me a compliment and I'm having that kind of placebo effect and everything is fine in that moment. So how do I recognize that this is just a placebo, or is that fine?

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, that's what you can do is you can reflect upon, oh, I feel good because I liked what he said about me. Now, one of the things that we can say is that you've heard me say many times about the sutra that says is that Buddha says, "Both formerly and now, I teach only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha." In that same paragraph, in the same sutta, he goes on to say that when people revile me or revere me, on that account, I have no elation of heart and no dejection of heart. And when somebody has something nice to say about me, guess what? They don't even know who I am. They're just out there complimenting. They're sucking up. They want something. They come to rub your back so they can put their hand in your pocket. Everybody who bothers you up wants something out of it, okay? Even if they're showing you their appreciation— it's still their good feelings of appreciation. And so, the right way to go is, even though they've said something really nice to you, it's not going to change your heart, because your heart's already in a good state. If they come in and they say something really nasty to you, you're not going to get into the objection of the heart, because your heart's already permanently, or at least quite well fixed into a happy state. And so this is why we practice getting the mind, getting the heart into a really happy state by getting out of the hindrances, which are quite subtle. And if you go all the way to anger, note that well. You might even want to go so far as to write down the date, the time, and the event, so that you can remember when you get angry. So that someday off into the future you can say, "Haha, it's been 5 years since I've been angry. Haha, it's been 2 years since I've even raised my voice." So that's the kind of language that we want to use, is to recognize that we've made changes. We don't get angry the way we used to. We can tell because we're watching. Be on guard for being angry so that you can see what brought that anger up, and you can deal with that so that next time it happens, you're not going to get.

**Speaker C:** Angry.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to get revenge because they didn't hit you. This is the amazing part. This is really real. This is the point, is that if they miss you, they took direct aim at you and they say, I've got my sights on you, bang, and I shoot you. Guess what? They're shooting at something else. The target that they're shooting at is the one that they have in their head because they don't know who you are. And what are you going to do? You're going to buy their trip? Oh, I am the one that they're shooting at. Let them hit me. And then I got to go take revenge because they hurt me? Or can you say, in fact, no, that's not me? So what he said about the label of Amrit— Amrit's a piece of trash— and they say that, and when you own the name Amrit, that means it all. Let me take that gun and point it right at me so that I make sure that I get hit by that bullet. But you can say, oh, I'm not the Anicca that they're talking about. You saw that in the Star Wars movie. In fact, the joke is, is that, oh, these are not the droids you're looking for. You remember that? That's a very famous line in Star Wars. I don't even know which one of the movies it's in, but I do know that that became very famous. Oh, these are not the droids you're looking for. This is the Force. In operation. In other words, you gave those cops a placebo that these are not the droids you're looking for. But you can use that for yourself also. Oh, I'm not the emit that they're criticizing. I'm not even the emit. That's just a name, doesn't mean a thing. I don't even know who I am, so how could I put myself up as a target? So when you have thoughts like that, then when they take aim at you, you're not going to get angry. You're going to see the joke in it. The bullet goes right by you. They can't touch you. Another way of talking about it is, is that it's not your business. What they say about Amrit is not your business, because they're not talking about you. They're talking about the Amrit in their head. So it's not yours, doesn't belong to you. And if it's not your business, then you don't have to do anything. But we go around butting into other people's business on a regular basis. We were taught to do that. This is why words like Budinsky or you're butting in This is the language that we use because we go and we own something that doesn't really belong to us. Then we get angry because we picked up and are getting hot about something that doesn't even belong to us at all. We butted into the conversation. He was off destroying some Amrit in his mind. He was having a great deal of joy, Harding something. In his own mind. So you're actually making things worse by owning what he's shooting at. Oh, this is me. Oh, I'm the target. And when you get hit, then what are you going to do? You're going to feel strong and get angry. How dare you say that about me? When in fact he didn't even know you. He's just talking about some Anicca in his head. So this is the real wisdom. This is the real teaching of the Buddha, is to have that thought when somebody insults what you would have ordinarily thought was you. When you have that thought, you say, wait a minute, that's not me. Let's not go by that crap. Let's not go into that hindrance of, oh, I'm wounded, oh, I lost something. Instead, we can have that feeling: "Aha! I saw that! He didn't catch me, he didn't hit me." This is how we practice over and over and over again, so that pretty soon when somebody can insult you, it doesn't, because it's not you. You get out of your own way. This is the real teaching of the Buddha, is, whenever we start to feel bad, see that. See that that's an unwholesome thought, that, "Oh, he got me, oh poor me," and come out of that and say, "Ah, I see that, and the joy is that he didn't hit me, he hit something in his own mind. Wow, I feel really great because he missed me." And we keep coming back to that point over and over again, that we begin to feel good about whatever happens. But we have been in such a habit of becoming the target that it's hard for us to stop being the target. So whenever you see that you're a target of someone, then you can tell yourself, 'Ah, I see that. I see that I've made myself a target, and I'm really not the target. Let's throw that gunman and his targets out.' and I'm okay. They're not my business. What my business? Oh, I'm having fun here. Now, in a way, this is also kind of a placebo. So let's start using these placebos wisely so that we can increase the percentage from 28, 34 45, 46% up to every time. Wow, we're hitting 90 now because we don't let that stuff hit us anymore. And when it does, you can see it immediately. Aha, I was about to buy that and now I don't. And so this is actually the real Dhamma is getting out of your own way. This is what the whole point about Anatta is, is that it's really not you. You make it your business when in fact it's not your business. And so the placebo really then is the cure for having gotten hit. But the reality is, is that you weren't hit at all. He missed you. And so we keep practicing like this over and over and over again. Now let's take it and change the subject just a little bit, and that is that some people have what you would call a travel bug. Kat was talking about this today. He's been there for 4 months and now he's ready to go. And I know exactly what he's talking about. I've been all over the place. I've been in almost every state in America, been all over Europe, been all over Southeast Asia. I've been to more provinces and areas in India than most Indians. And for sure, that's true in Thailand. The only people who have been in more places in Thailand than I have been is monks, because monks are all over the place. But one of the things that happens is eventually we begin to recognize, why should I go back to that place? I've already been there. And so we bring in the quality of been there, done that. I have been there already, I have done that already, let me give it a rest. So you can do that same thing then with anger. Oh, I've been angry before, look what it got me. I've done that. I've been in anger. I've done that. Let me not go do it again because I know that it has no.

**Speaker C:** Value.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, this also applies to addiction, right? Yes, it does. If you have your eyes open every time that you take something like gambling— gambling is addiction for people. Why? Because they keep wanting something out of it and they keep thinking that I'm going to get something. And when they recognize that they lose their life, they lose their fortune, they've got creditors hounding them, they can see that, then they can say, wait a minute, let's not do that. I've been there, I've done that. Let me become satisfied that I have done that. I've done enough gambling, I don't need to do anymore. I've done enough drugs, I don't need to do anymore. I've had enough alcohol, I don't need to do it anymore. I've had enough women, I don't need them anymore. Recognize that you've done that stuff, it didn't get you what you wanted, so now you can begin to quit. When that stuff comes up, you say, aha, been there, done that, which is exactly the same thing as aha, that's not my business, which is exactly the same thing as aha, he missed me. So, not my business, been there, done that, and he missed me. Those are the kind of thoughts that we want to have. Well, then, oh, I've got to go to Goa. I mean, all the guys are going to— all the monks are going to Bodhisattva. I got to go back again. I was there 50 years ago. I got to go back. No, I don't. Been there, done that. Yeah, the place has changed, but I probably won't like the changes, so let me just stay here where I am. I've been there, I've done that. I've been to go, I've been there, I've done that. I've been angry before, I've been there, I've done that. And I got angry, it was because it was none of my business, but I thought it was. So it's not my business. Like, Bodh Gaya is not my business. Being happy and content, that's my business. And we have to remember to say that to ourselves. We have to remember to come out of those hindrances and throw them out and come back into that happy state. Ah, that's not my business. Ah, been there, done that. Ah, he missed me. Uh, Dhammarato, just a quick question. Will you say the Buddha also did the same thing, like, just not my business? Well, he was using his own language, that in fact all of these words that I'm using— the Buddha had one, he had, aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I can see that unwholesome thought. Well, that's what 'been there, done that' is, is I don't have to go to go. I've been there, I've done that. So yes, this is exactly what the Buddha did. I'm just giving you a new language, a new frame of reference, putting it into context to where you can really get some value out of it. But the original point that the Buddha made was, 'Ha, I see that.' and I see you, Mara, which means I see it's unwholesome. So been there, done that is like I see that wanting to go travel is unwholesome. Not my business, which means that it's unwholesome if I get involved with it. So it's all a matter of being able to see the unwholesome, and what we say about it is manifold. And I'm giving you 3 here: been there, done that, not my business, and he missed me. And the Buddha says, ah, I see you, Mara. So you can come up with your own phrase when you can see that hindrance, when you can see that unwholesome thought. You don't have to get all the way to anger. You can see that hindrance as it arises. Oh, he got me. Oh, he touched me. And then we can change that into, huh, he missed, he missed me. And we have to practice this over and over again because we're in such a habit of just standing right up and being that target, getting blown away and feeling bad and having to get angry because you were hurt and perpetuating that cycle. So someplace we got to start breaking that cycle over and over and over again. It's not my business. Over and over again. Wow, I don't have to do that. I don't have to do that. That's another one. Aha, I see that. I see you, Mara. Aha, I see that argument that I'm having with Aunt Susie. You know, we had an argument yesterday. Susie and I, we really went at it tooth and tongue. But guess what? Susie went home. She's not here. Why should I keep arguing with the Susie in my head? I can say, wow, I'm really glad that Susie went home. Let me go home in my own mind and take a rest. She's not my business. I don't have to fix her by convincing her that I was.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So all of these are basically the same thing. This is a very, very simple teaching of the Buddha, but we need to put it in various contexts so that you guys can see it and come up with your own expression. So you can say, yeah, I don't have to get angry at that one. If I get angry, I'm going to make a mess of it. So, and it's not my business. Or, aha, I could see that. Been there, done that. Not my business. Over and over and over again, you keep repeating these kind of things, and pretty soon you'll be liberated from them. You'll be liberated because you do it over and over again. So Amrit, what do you think? Yes, it's very good. Can I also use the phrase, never mind, stop again, if I'm angry? Yes, exactly, exactly. Never mind, I don't have to do that. Never mind, I can just stop. Exactly. That's the same kind of expression. We do that over and over and over again. We don't have to go looking for placebos to make us happy. We can get the real deal. We can go directly to happiness, directly to feeling safe and secure. We don't have to beat the guy up in order to feel good. We can just drop him and feel really good. You heard stories like that the best revenge is served cold. Do you know what that means? That revenge is a meal that's very well best served.

**Speaker C:** Cold.

**Speaker A:** You guys haven't heard that? That was even in the Star Trek. God, don't watch Star Trek. That's the point. It's better to let it alone. Don't have to take revenge this year. You'll get revenge next year or 5 years from now. Except that there's even more important, and that is another way, is the best revenge is having a good life. The best revenge is living well. How many have heard that one? The best revenge is living well. What does that mean? That means he didn't get you, he didn't touch you, he didn't break your leg. You're not broken leg with a cast on. Oh, poor me, he hurt me. No, the best revenge is living well. The best revenge is forgetting all about it because it wasn't a big deal at all. He missed me, he can't get to me, he can't touch me. Therefore, I don't even have to take revenge. Because he missed his target. So the best revenge is living beautifully, living well. That's the best revenge. Just forget all about it and go your merry way. And if that were really, really well understood and well known, there wouldn't be anger, there wouldn't be uptight people, there wouldn't even be wars. Because people go to war because they're afraid that the other guy is going to do it to you, so you got to do it first. In fact, that's one of the forms of the Golden Rule. You know, Jesus gave the Golden Rule of do unto others the way that you want to be done unto. Well, the alternate for that is do unto others the way that you want to do unto you. Except do it first. Do it first. Attack. That an offense is the best defense. How many of you heard that? Offense is the best defense. Guess what? Friendship is a better defense, because an offense means that you're going to go get them before they get you, which is giving them now an opportunity for revenge. And so, the real Golden Rule is: Do unto others the way that they want to be done to. Because if I do people the way I want to be done to, I'm going to kill.

**Speaker C:** Them!

**Speaker A:** I'm going to attack them! I'm going to send my big tanks into the.

**Speaker C:** Ukraine!

**Speaker A:** We all have the attitude, it's not my business, Ukraine's not my business, then there's not going to be any wars. So the best thing then to do is to stop having enemies. Don't have any enemies, just have friends, because the enemies are the ones that you gotta defend against. You don't have to defend against your friends. So this is what's noble about it. The noble position is, is that you've got friends. Those guys who were attacking you are not your enemies, they're just misguided friends. They're trying to help you. When they say you're a big pile of shit, actually what they're saying is, here, let me help you remove all of your pile of shit. Then you're going to be okay. And so we stop having enemies. We stop seeing those guys as enemies who are attacking us. They're just friends. So all of this stuff winds up being the same thing. Been there, done that. It's not my business. And oh, it's just a friendly fire. He's not my enemy. So then we can forgive, forget all about it. That's what makes the Dhamma so beautiful, is that it works. It's not a placebo. Why? Because the placebos don't last long. It's a momentary feeling. Buying that new car is momentary. You feel really good. The guy who makes the touchdown feels really good. The musician who gets into the, uh, Hillbilly Hall of Fame for just a little while, he feels good. It's a placebo. And the real deal is over and over again, we got to take that repetition and come out of those unwholesome places over and over and over again. Then we don't have to go around looking for ways to feel good because we already feel Great. David, do you have any.

**Speaker B:** Comments? One interesting thing I heard you say was if the monk is noble, he won't do these ceremonies and rituals.

**Speaker A:** No, I said that was Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. There is a lot of nobles who will give those placebos to people because that's what they're expecting from him. And so he gives them the little toy because they're not really ready for the real noble teaching. They don't even want the real noble teachings. They'd rather have the placebo. And so there's a lot that— in fact, you could say then that there's three kinds of monks. The mass majority of them are those who don't recognize that these placebos, they think that they're the real deal. They believe in the magic, they believe in that water ceremony, and so they'll do it fervently, making sure that that placebo works. And then you have the beginning noble who sees it and recognizes that it is a placebo, but he goes ahead and does it anyway because, number one, that's what's expected of him. And it's a very, very senior monk like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa who says, "Oh, you guys, even you new nobles, you want to go do that ceremony, go ahead, but I don't need it." This is in fact almost always when the teachings of the Buddha are taught, even if they're taught by a noble, the first teachings that he does is through the placebos. If you can get somebody to feel good, through the placebos, then you can introduce them to the real Dharma. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa didn't want it like that. He says, "Oh no, let's start with the supramundane, let's start with the noble. If they're ready for it, they'll listen." You don't have to give them candy in order to get them to eat broccoli. You can feed them broccoli and they'll love it.

**Speaker B:** What do you think the lay people would say if like a monk, a new monk came along and on Bindabhat, and then that monk didn't want to do any of these rituals, didn't want to give any blessings or anything like this? What do you think the lay people would say?

**Speaker A:** I would say that it depends upon the circumstances, and generally the lay people are not paying enough attention, so they don't care because they're not even watching. They've got a whole line of monks there, there's 6 or 7, they feed them all, and then only 5 monks show up for the ceremony. They don't know, they don't see, they don't care. It's only when you're already in the practice, in the vicinity of a real noble like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that he'll say those kind of things. He will stay noble all the time. That in fact, even the Buddha would do the placebo part. In other words, in fact, the way that he would get students to become Bhikkhus or become lay followers, by this technique that I call pacing and leading. You buy into it and let them think that you bought into it so that you believe the same thing that they believe. They begin to trust you, and then you can pull them out of their stupidity. So there's that three-way. One, the guy believes the hogwash, and everybody is a bit happy from time to time in the hogwash. They're in the placebo land. And then there are the really wise ones. So you could say, in fact, that there is four. But really there's only 3 because, uh, you see, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was already to the point. And in fact, the Buddha became that way too when he had already enough teachers to teach the Dharma. He wasn't interested in teaching anymore. There's especially the story about Ananda. Ananda just would not get.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker A:** He just— he attended the Buddha. In fact, the whole point of him attending the Buddha was a problem for him, that he never really— he could listen to the Buddha day in and day out and he still didn't get it. But if he had gone to Sariputta and let Sukkha beat his ass, he would have probably gotten it a lot faster. And so there's various teaching styles, and one of the teaching styles is you don't have a clue. And I've had high school teachers, I've had algebra teachers who did not know algebra. Then you have the teacher who really understands and knows, and they'll kind of go along with the students to try to get the students to get somewhere. And then there's going to be The Bhikkhu Buddhadasa students, in fact, these are the guys at university they call Professor Emeritus. He's not going to put up with any bullshit at all. You got to be on the money before he's going to give you any.

**Speaker C:** Lessons.

**Speaker A:** And so you see all three styles at university. So the Buddha would pace, he would lead, he would put up with them. While they were in their ignoble state, with the idea of moving them when the time was right into really beginning to see the reality. And I found myself in that position in the US. That yeah, I went along with it, go along to get along, but I could go along and get along happily, knowing that these people all are getting placebo, and they do not want to hear the Dhamma. But I'm really grateful for you guys, because you know that I'm not going to give you placebos. I'm not going to give you crap to fit in with all the crap that you've already got just to make you feel.

**Speaker C:** Good.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, I can't really hear you, Michael. Can you put your microphone in your mouth? Yes, thank you very much for today's talk, Dhammarato, and it's very good to see everyone today. Yeah, it's been really great.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Everyone. I hope that I was helpful to you, Jonas. I hope that you kind of understand where we're going with.

**Speaker C:** This. Yeah, I'm getting to it. Yeah, thanks very much. I learned so.

**Speaker A:** Much. All right, well, you guys, this has been a great call. Thank you very much. I've really enjoyed.

**Speaker C:** Myself.

**Speaker A:** Thank you everyone. All right guys, good to see you. Bye-bye guys. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on the theme of **"placebo effects" in religious practice versus the "real medicine" of the Buddha's core teachings.** The discussion begins with a specific ritual—the Thai water ceremony for transferring merit—and expands into a broader analysis of spiritual practice.

### **Core Argument: Placebo vs. Liberation**
Dhammarato argues that many common Buddhist rituals (water ceremonies, chanting, blessings of cars/houses) and even some meditation techniques operate as **"placebos."** They provide temporary comfort, goodwill, and a sense of well-being to practitioners (effective for ~28-45% of people, akin to clinical placebos) but do not lead to genuine liberation. They are often cultural additions or "magical thinking" that predate or exist alongside the Dhamma.

### **The Real Teaching: Direct Path to Liberation**
The true Dhamma, in contrast, is presented as the **"real medicine."** Its goal is **liberation (moksha)**, defined as:
*   Permanently dropping defilements and hindrances.
*   Gaining direct knowledge and control over one's attitudes and feelings.
*   Achieving a stable, happy mind independent of external conditions.

### **Key Practical Instructions**
The talk emphasizes a practical, moment-to-moment practice:
1.  **Identify Hindrances, Not Just Symptoms:** Anger, for example, is not itself a hindrance but a reaction to underlying hindrances like ill-will, fear, or a sense of loss.
2.  **Use "Direct Path" Phrases:** When a hindrance or unwholesome thought arises, cut it off immediately with mindful reframing:
    *   **"Been there, done that."** (Recognizing the old, unhelpful pattern)
    *   **"Not my business."** (Not owning others' opinions or external events)
    *   **"He missed me."** (Understanding criticism is aimed at a mental projection, not your true self)
    *   **"I see you, Māra."** (The classic recognition of unwholesome states)
3.  **Practice Relentlessly:** Like learning a musical instrument, liberation requires continuous practice in seeing and abandoning hindrances as they arise.

### **The Role of Monks and Rituals**
Dhammarato explains a spectrum of monastic engagement with rituals:
*   **Monks who believe in the magic:** They think the rituals are the real Dhamma.
*   **Noble monks who perform them knowingly:** They understand the placebo effect but provide it because laypeople expect and benefit from it temporarily. They use it as a skillful means ("pacing and leading") to eventually guide people to the real Dhamma.
*   **Monks like Buddhadasa Bhikkhu:** They reject rituals entirely, seeing them as distractions, and teach only the supramundane path.

### **Conclusion**
The ultimate message is an invitation to move beyond temporary comforts (placebos) and commit to the disciplined work of self-observation and mental cultivation. The real Dhamma is about **"getting out of your own way"** through insight into *anattā* (not-self), thereby finding a happiness that is not dependent on ceremonies, external validation, or the defeat of perceived enemies. The path is simple but requires constant, vigilant practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references **stories** to illustrate the distinction between ritualistic "placebo" practices and the core liberating teachings of the Buddha.

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **Placebo / Medicine:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Placebos:** Rituals (water ceremony, chanting, blessings of cars/houses), belief in literal rebirth, meditation as mere noting, the idea that enlightenment is a distant magical goal, even coffee breaks and hospital stays. They provide temporary good feelings (28-45% effective) but are not the "real medicine" for lasting liberation.
    *   **Real Medicine:** The direct practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, seeing and abandoning hindrances, and the realization of non-self (*anatta*). This is the "real deal" that leads to permanent liberation.

2.  **Magical Thinking:** Used interchangeably with "placebo" to describe superstitious beliefs embedded in cultural Buddhism (e.g., blessed cars needing no insurance).

3.  **Chick Magnet / Car / House:** A metaphor for indirect, placebo solutions to deeper problems. The example is wanting love (a sense of lack) and trying to solve it by buying a flashy car ("pocket rocket") or house, which only gives temporary satisfaction (a mortgage) rather than addressing the root cause.

4.  **Target / Dartboard / Getting Hit:** A metaphor for taking insults personally.
    *   When someone insults "Amrit," they are shooting at a mental image in their own head. If you identify with the name/insult, you "stand up as the dartboard" and get hit, leading to anger. Wisdom is seeing "he missed me" because the insult wasn't about the true, non-self reality.

5.  **Been There, Done That:** A metaphor for recognizing and letting go of repetitive, unwholesome patterns (anger, addiction, the travel bug) because you've seen their fruitless results before.

6.  **Musical Instrument Practice:** Metaphor for the genuine Dhamma path. Liberation requires repeated, skillful practice, like learning an instrument, not just occasional ritual or placebo.

### **Stories and References:**

1.  **Picasso's Doodle:** The story of Picasso quickly drawing a simple, abstract figure (like Don Quixote) for an obnoxious fan, which later became famous. This is compared to the abstract, squiggly blessings monks draw with paste on cars or bank vaults, implying the ritual's value is in the perception of the believer, not in any intrinsic magic.

2.  **Star Wars - "These are not the droids you're looking for":** Referenced to illustrate the "mind trick" of realizing an insult is not about your true self. You can use the "force" of wisdom to see "these are not the insults I'm looking for... he missed me."

3.  **The Buddha and Mara:** The canonical story of the Buddha recognizing and dismissing temptations and hindrances personified as Mara. The speaker equates this to saying "Aha, I see you, Mara" which is the same as saying "Been there, done that" or "That's not my business" to unwholesome thoughts.

4.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Stance:** The story (or example) of the Thai reformist monk Buddhadasa, who refused to perform placebo rituals because he knew they were not the true Dhamma. This is contrasted with other monks who either believe in the magic or perform the rituals out of compassion for laypeople's expectations.

5.  **Ananda's Struggle:** The story of the Buddha's attendant Ananda, who heard the Dhamma constantly but did not become enlightened until after the Buddha's passing. This illustrates that proximity to teaching isn't enough; direct practice and sometimes stricter teaching styles are needed.

6.  **Proverbs & Sayings:** The speaker references and re-frames common sayings to make Dhamma points:
    *   *"Revenge is a dish best served cold"* is acknowledged but superseded by the idea *"the best revenge is living well."*
    *   *"The best defense is a good offense"* is countered with *"friendship is a better defense."*
    *   The **Golden Rule** ("do unto others...") is critiqued; a wiser version is *"do unto others the way* ***they*** *want to be done to,"* to avoid projecting your own desires.

### **Overall Narrative:**
The talk itself tells a **story of contrast**: It begins with a specific ritual (the water ceremony), classifies it as a culturally embedded "placebo," and then expands into a broader critique of how "magical thinking" pervades religion. It then contrasts this with the "real medicine" of the Buddha's core psychological teachings, using modern metaphors and stories to make the ancient path of liberation accessible and practical. The arc moves from **description** of ritual, to **diagnosis** (placebo), to **prescription** (direct path, non-identification).
