### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So Robert, we can continue from the last time that we talked, and this time that you're saying that you're actually putting some effort in then to practice to remember.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, I'm not just like letting it be, you know, whenever I remember to do it, I'll do it, because I find that doesn't really work for me. Then I'll remember to do it and try to do it.

**Speaker A:** It does once you get the rhythm going. Yes, but you have to put that time in that we can call seclusion time. And that we need to build that up. And so this is one of the reasons why it's better to practice several times a day for short times rather than a long time once a day, is because you're starting to develop that remembrance to go practice. And so I would recommend that you start doing that formally, and then the gaps will fill build in, but you need to keep that, uh, that rhythm going. And so I'd say the first time to start it is when you're still in bed in the morning. Okay, before you get out of bed, yeah, start thinking about, wow, this is really nice. I could lay here and take a deep breath and just enjoy this moment. It's so nice. Yeah, yeah, do that for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then later, um, let us say it depends upon how you get to work, but during the transportation to work, even if it's driving a car, you can do that in the sense of, all right, I'm going to watch every breath and I'm going to stay mindful and I'm going to practice while I am watching the road and the surroundings. That part of the practice is visual contact. And so that gives you another opportunity. And then lunch is a time for mindful eating. And so we pay close attention to what the food is doing in the mouth and the breathing and what kind of thoughts that we're having. Thoughts of gratitude for the food. Well, isn't this good nourishment? Et cetera, like that. So now we've got what, 4 times a day already set out. Then going back home during transportation, if you're sitting on a ferry or a train or a bus or whatever, that makes it all the easier. But you can still mindfully drive, intentionally so. And so At night when you get into bed, that's the best time to practice. A lot of people say, I practice meditation before I go to bed, and I'm saying that in bed is the best time to do it, is to get in there and really relax and really enjoy the moment. No place to go and nothing to do, and I can just lay here in the bed and just enjoy it. Wow, this feels so good. But we're actually doing that by intention and plan, to start taking those times a day, or whichever ones that you would like to choose. You get about 5, 6, 7 of them. 6 is a good number. 6 times a day, 10 minutes. That's only an hour. But look how many times we're really putting the effort into doing it for 10 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Thanks. That's going to be my plan going forward. Yeah, that's a really good point, especially about eating meditations. I already know about that, but I never actually do it. I'm always like watching something while I'm eating. And just being distracted. And that's like a perfect opportunity because there's like a whole sense door there that never gets used. I'd never normally use. Um, um, another thing that I've, um, it's like there's, there's like different kinds of wholesome states that I'll get into where I'll have like— let me think how to explain. So like one of them is like a productive state. So I'm like in a really productive, focused mood, but I'm in a good mood, but I'm like energized and I'm like very desirous. Like I'm really trying to like get something done and I'm really strongly motivated and desiring like the goal of the task, completing the task. So it's kind of like a state, but it's still wholesome. And then there's other ones where it's more like relaxed, where I'm just like laying in, in bed, like when I'm falling asleep, for example, and I'm really relaxed and it's like not desirous at all. It's just completely like no, nothing to do, nowhere to go, just relaxing. Um, and then I become very sleepy very quickly. And kind of like I've been, instead of just having it where I'm like I'm just focusing on having it like be wholesome. I've kind of been focusing to try and make it like become one of these like specific kinds of wholesome states. Sometimes like when I just try to gladden the mind, like if I have to get something done and I like to like a wholesome state where I'm like so detached from getting it done, like I won't have any motivation to do it anymore. And then like that can kind of backfire on me. And then like I have negative thoughts like, hey, you should do this and stuff, which I know it's like more negative thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Right. So it's a slight difference in the positive thought, like I can do this. Oh, wow, this is fun. I can do this email right now. I've already thought about it too much and now it's time to do it and lickety-split, no problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Still has the attitude of being a winner though.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's it, that's it. It's that attitude, like I still have the winner mindset. I'm out of the victimhood and the Dukkha, into the satisfaction, and I'm enjoying whatever is happening. I noticed as well, I have this thing with whenever I try to do like long formal sits, so like more than 30 minutes, I fall asleep. And so I was trying to cultivate—.

**Speaker A:** Nowadays you know that you were falling asleep. In the old days when you were doing it, you thought that was good meditation.

**Speaker B:** True, true.

**Speaker A:** I know, I've been there, done that.

**Speaker B:** Um, but I was trying to like in my meditations bring in some of this, I guess, um, motivated kind of desirous form of satisfaction so that I could like stay alert during the meditations. And sometimes it works, sometimes it backfires. Sometimes I'll go like too much effort and then I'll get stressed out, like I'll be very awake but I won't be satisfied anymore.

**Speaker A:** So I'll be like, have you ever heard of the middle path?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** So, so we need to find that balance point, and that's what you're discovering now. But the fulcrum for that balance point is the positive winner's attitude. That's what keeps that. But recognize that when we say middle way and balance, think about a teeter-totter. You know, what is a teeter-totter? That may not be a word to you, right? What the kids play on, right? Okay. Now, if we kept that teeter-totter completely level, 100% level, 100% of the time, what value is it?

**Speaker B:** Zero.

**Speaker A:** Zero, right. No, the teeter-totter is not just designed for, but mimics the reality of up and down and up and down and up and down. And so the balance has to become a dynamic balance. That balance, then, the middle path becomes a dynamic balance that I sometimes use with the phrase sea legs. Have you ever heard me talk about sea legs?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like staying balanced on a boat in like a storm, like— Right, or.

**Speaker A:** Just in heavy weather. Right. And the deck is not flat and solid. It's like a teeter-totter. And we— and normal land is like flat and level, but on the deck of the ship, it's back and forth. And how's your balance? Are you going to be careening into things because you don't have sea legs, or are you going to be able to stay in balance even though things are going up and down? In your life. And not only that, but now we can actually begin to regulate that. That you probably have done this. You can stand on that teeter-totter with your legs and balance it, but you can also lean and make the teeter-totter lean back and forth. The reality is, is that you're in charge of this. Your attitude goes up and down, and you can begin to see that too. And the best way to do it is the recognition of the wholesome attitude, whether there is something to do actually in reality, or that there's nothing to do in the actual reality. In both cases, you got it. You got it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like— That's the winner's attitude. I feel like I certainly like the latter perspective, as like nothing to do, but I like it because I strongly crave just like being kind of lazy and not doing anything. So I like it, like, because I feel like it in a sense gives me, like, permission to do that, to, like, let go of, like, my rules. Like you said, like, I should be productive, like, that's a rule in my head. Like, it gives me, I guess, permission to let that go. But obviously, like, there is a time when I do need to, like, handle these things, at which point I, I need to, I need to have this, this other kind of attitude where I'm, like, very energized and active and stuff, but still satisfied. Like if I'm exercising outside, like going for a jog, like, um, I'm probably gonna go for a jog after this call, for example, and I was just— it just came into my head and I was thinking about it and I was like, man, I don't want to do that, you know, I'd rather just stay, stay in bed or— and just like stay inside and just relax. And then I was like, well, you know, if I can make it so that my attitude is happy and it's also enjoying, you know, the moving the body through space, like that kind of feeling. Like, I'm enjoying that type of activity, that type of pattern of sensations in reality. It's like, it's, it's kind of like, it's like I need to be able to have— be able to keep that winner's attitude despite these different, like, modes that I have to be in. At different times in the day and in the week.

**Speaker A:** Right. And in fact, that's exactly why we want to learn by practicing and by developing the skill in solitude. In our case, those 6 times a day is when we want to keep coming back to that, developing that right noble attitude. With gladdening the mind and breathing deep and really enjoying doing nothing. So then we can take that enjoyment of doing nothing and put it to good work.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Rather than having to lose that feeling of joy and satisfaction and doing nothing, losing it because now I've got to go work. So it's okay to feel bad because I've got to work now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's the thing is for me it's like these, it's like transitioning between these different modes of being, that tends to be a part where I'll really lose my balance and the teacher Tathagata will fall into unwholesomeness. Off track is— yeah, it's going from.

**Speaker A:** Like— that's okay, and it's okay for you to notice it and to make that your friend. It's new education material.

**Speaker B:** Right? Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And you say, aha, these are the times when I'm most likely to lose it. So you look at the environment, you look at the situation, and you'll note that, saying, aha, next time When these set of circumstances arise, I'm going to keep it together. You can actually plan in advance. You can actually think about scenarios that would be really tough, really tough going, and think about how you're going to handle that wisely, comfortably, and happily. Rehearse. So you can rehearse with nothing to do and everything is OK and easygoing. Then we can rehearse with work and then we can rehearse in, let us say, the dry run of a nuclear attack or what they call in art a dress performance, a dress rehearsal. You don't have an audience yet. It's not real yet, but you're going through every motion for rehearsal. Okay, this is basically what we're doing. We're rehearsing how to play Robert's Song of Life.

**Speaker B:** I like that. That, that actually, that makes sense. Like I go for a run outside and I end up feeling really tired and miserable and not having a good time on it. I can think to myself, next time I do this, I'm going to make sure to think like this type of wholesome thought. I'm going to be thinking about, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, let's not do it in the sense of next time. Okay, from what I gather, you're talking about you're out on a run and all of a sudden you recognize you don't like it. Yeah, and now you're planning for the future.

**Speaker B:** How do I stop that? Like, yeah, how do I stop that happening?

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right, that you got the answer. How do you stop? By stopping. You just stop. In this case, the running. Stop the running. Just stop. If you don't mind, I'll quote a sutta for you. This is in the Sutta Nipata, and the Sutta Nipata is well known with the scholars to be some of the most ancient stuff, that much of the Sutta Nipata was either memorized early in the Buddha's career or actually written down already in the Buddha's career, that in fact, in the Anguttara Nikaya, It refers to the Sutta Nipata by name and sutta name, which is very interesting. So this is very, very old. All right. And the story is, is that the guy is running. He's out for a run. And then the thought occurs to him, why am I running when I could walk? And while he was walking, he noticed a shade tree, and he says, why should I continue to walk in the sun when I can stand in the shade of that tree? And when he goes to the shade of the tree, he decides, oh well, why should I stand when I can sit down and lean on the tree? And while he was sitting there He was saying, well, why don't I go ahead and lay down? Okay, so now you're out on a run and you're asking how to stop. Well, what you can do is you can stop running and start walking, then you can stop walking and stand, and then you can sit down on the curb and say, I don't have to stand up and start running again until I like it, right then and there. Okay, remember, everything that we're talking about here has to do with immediate, right here, right now. That's all there is. And here you're saying, next time I'm on a run, blah blah blah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You're on the run right now, right? So if you don't like on the run right now, stop the running. Slow down.

**Speaker B:** Just like change my environment into something where I can gladden the mind, where I am able to start thinking wholesome again and get back on track.

**Speaker A:** Right. In that scenario or in that circumstance, we could say become secluded from the running for a little while so that you get your mind back together.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. That makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** Get away from it. So if you're not enjoying what you're doing, the first thing to do is stop doing it. So an example of that is you're angry and you're yelling at somebody, and as soon as you wake up to that, the first thing to do is to stop, which means to shut your mouth, to shut up. And that's the first thing to do, is to stop talking. So for you out on the run, the first thing you do is you stop running.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's simple, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** It is, it's very simple.

**Speaker A:** Go back into seclusion from the running or whatever and get your mind back together again, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. We kind of then and there so that we can recollect ourselves, and then we exit this illusion with our improved mindset. Okay, great, great. Yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense. I'm.

**Speaker A:** Following. Well, Laurent is calling, so I'll talk to him after I talk to you. I was already on a call this morning and some new person called and then he didn't hang around. So we'll hear from them later. So I think in the background you can hear the Skype music.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was interesting. It started ringing and I was just entering seclusion like mid-call. It's kind of a funny like example, but I felt like I was getting like— I was like worrying about like what to say to you next, and I was like— and that was like stressing me out. So I like closed my eyes and did some deep breathing to like kind of slow down my like fast-paced energy, my, um, desirous, driven, stressy-like energy, you know, go to like a slower pace, kind of slow it down and just like get back to wholesomeness. It's crazy, like the thing that, the thing that I feel like really trips me up a lot is that, is that sometimes wholesomeness is like it's not the same formula every time. Like, it has to be like different for each circumstance. Like, sometimes it's slowing down, and then other times, like, if I'm really sad, like, I need to actually— like.

**Speaker A:** I.

**Speaker B:** Know you described it before, I described it this way, I said like pump myself up, like get excited, get like hyped up, like I need to like, I need to like actually like kind of actively kind of feel like I'm creating the feelings of pity and Sukkha and really, yeah, I get a lot of like Piti going and just be like really excited and hyped up and stuff. And then at other times when I'm stressed, it's like the opposite of that, and I'm trying to let the air out of the balloon, so to speak, and like relax. It's, it's, um, I don't know, I don't know what to ask. It's just, it's kind of crazy. Like, it's, I think my problem might be like confusion, maybe. Like, I get confused as to knowing which one I should be doing at a given time. Like, I'm like, should I create happiness or should I like try to let go of stress? You know, like which, which is the right one to do at a given time. I don't know if you have any—.

**Speaker A:** I would say that they're the same or they're similar. You sound like Tarzan swinging on the vine saying, should I grab hold of that other vine before I let go of this one? And the answer is, is one smooth motion.

**Speaker B:** One smooth motion.

**Speaker A:** One smooth motion of letting go of the Dukkha and picking up the Sukkha. Not much to it. Think about a conveyor belt and whatever product there's on it. Some, some of it is good and you want it, and some of it is bad. It could be tomatoes, or you're picking out the bad tomatoes, right? Or it could be trash, and you're looking for a particular thing. Like, well, they separate metal with a magnet, but let us say you're looking for cardboard or you're looking for paper, and all of the other plastic and whatnot, right? Okay, so that's the way to do it, is begin to become selective in all of the trash that comes by in front of you and let it— let that take care of itself. In other words, if you see anxiety, then you can say with the right attitude, oh yeah, I see that anxiety. Hello, anxiety, my old Arahant, right? So that, that's the whole way of looking at it, is that most people, they, they're anxious and uptight and they don't know it, but it still makes them miserable. And then when they see the uptight and the anxiety, now they really hate it. Which just makes it more so because of the hatred. But when we see it as a learning tool— aha, okay, so right now in this circumstance I get agitated. Let me, number one, right now that I'm seeing it, cool off. And then number two, examine what caused the anxiety, what kind of thoughts or what kind of circumstances they are. And so you can note that, ah, I'm going to avoid that from now on. Okay, so let us say that the guy has a dead daughter, and every time he has the dead daughter, uh, when he, when he had the dead daughter in the first place, he had to do all the funeral and all that kind of stuff, and so he really wasn't dealing with his grief. But later, now, every time he thinks about his daughter he goes into a state of grief.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And he's not even aware that that's what's going on. But when he goes into a state of grief, he also is not easy to be around for other people. And he's not even knowing that he's not around other people. He's in his own mind thinking about his daughter. So he visits a psychologist and they work that out. And the psychologist says, okay, you become aware of these thoughts about your daughter and set them aside. Now, whenever the daughter comes up, now the grief is going to be 10 times bigger than it was before because he's aware of what he's doing. But slowly over time, he can say, no, I'm not going to think about her right now. I'm not going to wallow in this pity party of grief. I'm going to set her aside and go on with my life. Let dead daughters be dead in the past. Now, he will have that attitude 10 years after she dies. Why can't he have that attitude 10 days after she dies? Why does he have to keep going into this state of grief every time he thinks about her? Or why does it get more intense when he recognizes that that's what causes him to be miserable, is thoughts about his daughter? And it doesn't matter how many thoughts he has about his daughter, it's not going to bring her back. Better to forget all about it. And so now he's got a learning tool. All thoughts about my daughter are dangerous. Let's not go there. Let's not go into her room. Let's not carry a photograph of her in my wallet. Let's put things in the past and set them aside and let them go. Now I know that there are many issues in our society. We'll say Dhammarato says that Wow, what a heartless criminal he is. And what, to forget all about my dead relatives? I mean, the Chinese are really going to come after me with that because of the ancestor worship and all of that kind of stuff. But I'm just using daughter as an example because it's actually true about any and everything that you lose.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And like, I relate to it even though I haven't lost a child. Like, I've lost plenty of things where I, I could still find myself thinking grieving thoughts and self-pitying thoughts even, you know, years after the loss. Yeah, that's like— and we feel bad.

**Speaker A:** All over again for no reason at all other than we were not mindful of kind of thoughts that we were having. We were not watching what we were doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I feel like we do have to be kind of like heartless to ourselves just a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Um, if reality is heartless, then absolutely we got to get real.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a good way of putting it. I've pretty heartless, to be honest. So.

**Speaker A:** That heartful thing, another word for it is romantic. The age of romance or romantic. Okay, we romanticize everything. Do you know what that means? We try to make it, but we don't want to see it the way that it is. We want it to be better than that. We want all love stories to end happily ever after, and not one of them does. It's romantic thinking that things want to work out. They don't work out. Somebody dies or somebody gets killed, either in court.

**Speaker B:** I like that, romantic thinking. That's a good one, like superstitious thinking.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's hard for right. So let's be heartless. Let's get real.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that means let's put away the past. Let's not deal with it. We talked about this before in the sense of remorse, remember? Because basically one of my daughters is the bad deeds that I've done in my past.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** And so I think about that daughter, I'm thinking about that wrong deed that I did. So me, I, me, my, my. But the reality is that I'm not like that. Not now. I'm different. That's not my daughter. That's not me. Right? That's the whole idea of recognizing that you change. Going back to the story about the guy who was sad and unhappy because he lost his daughter, that she died. Guess what? Now he's not a dad. He's not a dad with a dead daughter. Stop being a dad. Be who you are now. Instead of trying to be what you used to be.

**Speaker B:** That's a really good point. Yeah, he's not a dad anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's not a dad anymore. You're— that's not who I am anymore. That you're something new now. Every moment you're brand new. Why should we follow the rules and the dictates of the past when I've got a brand new day?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think a lot of it could— for me, it has to do with worry. Like, I'm worrying that if I don't, if I don't stay in touch with, um, the past, that I'm gonna fall for the same sort of traps again, uh, today. Like, if I'm not thinking about it. And the really clear example that comes to mind is, um, unwholesome thoughts that are like ultimately unwholesome, but they seem wholesome on the surface. So there's like an instant gratification from thinking them. Um, the best example that comes to mind is like angry thoughts. There's the instant gratification, but then there's the crash, there's the coming back down.

**Speaker A:** Precisely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So When you become aware of those kind of things, that's when you could say, aha, there it is. You make note of it. As I have told many of the students, you put that on your don't-do-that list because you recognize with your new cost-benefit analysis that it does not give you the benefit that you originally thought. But it did. That we don't get that much gratification and we're going to have to put up with a whole lot of negative stuff. In other words, we got to pay for this lunch and the payment is way more than the lunch is worth. And when we see that, we'll start saying, don't eat at that restaurant.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. It's like that. The advertising looks nice. But don't eat that because it costs too much. Yeah, when the bill comes, it's too much.

**Speaker A:** Right, when the bill comes, it's too much. That's the reality. The romantic only sees the delicious food and cannot see the bill coming.

**Speaker B:** It's like being like a child versus like an adult. Like as a child, like you just see everything as like romantic, but as an adult, behind that image, there's the reality, which is a lot more harsh.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that amazing? Yes, that's what growing up is all about, is the ability to weigh things out to see is this worth it or not. And when you get good at that, that's wisdom itself.

**Speaker B:** Right? Right, right. Yeah, like foresight. You're seeing in future what this is going to lead to, and you're getting a better judgment now in the present moment of if you should pursue this or not, because you see now where this leads. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so you wind up then being in a what is called a win-win situation. You win and so do the people around you. Everybody becomes a winner.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** As opposed to criminals, they win, but everybody else loses. Then they figure out that, wait a minute, that win was not worth it. So the ones who go around lose-lose where everybody loses, we could call those people just stupid. And the problem with stupid people is they stay stupid. And most of the world is stupid. Yes, they don't do things that benefit themselves, and they don't do things that benefit other people.

**Speaker B:** One sec, I'll be right back. One sec. Yeah, so it's like becoming wise is like becoming the win-win person instead of the lose-lose, which is the stupid, or the win-lose, which is the criminal, or the helpless hapless is the lose-win. Yeah, right, right.

**Speaker A:** You remembered. Excellent. Yeah, it's, it's kind of, it's Funny I left that one out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like, it's cool to see like how these different states of mind, like we have like the kind of like the obvious like stereotyped versions of like a criminal and then like a member of the like Democratic Party or what the example was, but then we have like really like micro-level versions of these kind of— I feel like in ourselves, on like a more moment-to-moment basis, like we have the most kind of reactive patterns. Like, like a pattern where I'll react to a certain event or thought or something in like a certain way. Like, I have like, like sometimes I'll have like a negative thought and I'll react to it, um, based on like the causes and conditions, like in a, in a, like, a helpless kind of victimy way where I'll be like, like, okay, Mr. Negative Thought, the world is all terrible, you're right. And then I'll take on that, and the result is that I'd be like reborn as like a victim.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point though, is, is that you can in fact see that the world is in fact quite a mess, and see it almost like a joke, that the world is actually quite funny. It's ridiculous how many stupid people there are going around acting stupid and expecting something new to happen. It's a joke. It's funny. Can you see it? If you can see the humor in it, then you're the winner. You don't have to come back to the victim's position of, "Really, ain't it awful?" Now our "ain't it awful" is humorous, it's ironic. Ain't it awful about how bad things are? I mean, have you seen what Putin is doing in the Ukraine? I mean, ain't it awful?

**Speaker B:** It's funny, we're like talking about these like human tragedies and like smiling. It's quite absurd. Ain't it awful?

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, we can sit here and be glum and be blue. Are that— is that going to help either the Ukrainians or Putin?

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, not at all.

**Speaker A:** No. So it's our choice that here now we can be joyful. Never mind that the world is a terrible place for terrible people. That's not the world I'm in. Let the terrible place for the terrible people stay terrible, and I'm going to sit back and enjoy the show. You've heard in Shakespeare plays, there's got various kind of plays, like there's some of them that are tragedies. That in fact most of his history plays are real tragedies, like Macbeth and Hamlet and whatnot like that. But then there's the other kind, which would be like A Midsummer Night's Dream and those kinds of plays, which are a mixture of comedy and tragedy, a tragic comedy. And then there's the kind that are just a farce. Okay, everything is just funny. Well, guess what? That is an attitude for those in the audience. You can either see what's going on as a tragedy, you can see it as a tragic comedy, or you could see it as a farce. So it's better to see the world as a farce. It's farcical. It's ridiculously funny. It's so bad that it's funny.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's so bad, it's funny.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, ain't it, Uncle? How bad the world is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's like, I feel like it's like we're powerless to do things about it, but we can laugh at how powerless we are and now we have some power.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but here is the power. In fact, yes, I was just about to get to that and power is a good enough word to use to get into it. And that is that the power is I don't have to get sucked into the tragedy. Yes, the world is a tragedy, but it's not my tragedy. It's not mine. The world is not mine. Let it be what it is. Let it be my entertainment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, let me step back and be entertained by it instead of being confused and offended and angered and all that stuff.

**Speaker A:** And that's the way that we were raised, and we were raised by people who were also stuck in it, offended, confused, didn't know what to do, but were surely ordered around to go do something. Everybody has the idea that things are so bad, they're so messed up, that we got to get mobilized. Everybody's go get something to do. Let's go fix this. And in that environment, we wind up all being Keystone Cops.

**Speaker B:** What does that mean?

**Speaker A:** Oh, you don't know about the Keystone Cops? Oh, the Keystone Cops were— it was a comedy back in the time of silent movies. Way before your time, OK? And in these silent movies, these police, the Keystone Cops, would run around and bang into each other, bang into the side of their truck, fall off the truck, all kinds of things. Supposedly, while some piano player was playing some honky-tonky music that was funny.

**Speaker B:** Arahant. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so that's what the world is. The world is actually— we are all officers in the Corps of Keystone Cops. We got to go fix the world and we got to go do it. And everybody's in a hurry. And so we keep running into each other and falling down because we're all trying to fix the world. But nobody's really quite sure exactly what it is that needs fixing in the world because there's so much to get fixed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And it's like, it's like we don't know what's going on, but we're trying to like solve it and stuff. But we, because we're like in the Dukkha, we're, we can't see clearly like what we're doing is leading to what, right? The wisdom like we talked about, we don't have the ability to see that me fixing this is going to lead to this problem over here and this problem over here.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. So the thing to do is to stop trying to get anything done and look at what's going on, so that we can now get our own hardware straightened out rather than trying to fix the world. And when we recognize that the world is actually just okay the way that it is, that it's not a tragic situation that the world is just fine. There has been dog-eat-dog. There have been Russian tanks for a long time, right? That's just how things are. And we can either enjoy it and enjoy the show and recognize that the world is just fine. Planet Earth has got no problems at all. In fact, the only problems that exist are the problems that humans think exist. And when you stop seeing everything as a problem— that as.

**Speaker B:** Ajahn Maha Boowa.

**Speaker A:** Has said, that the whole world is nothing but a toilet of shit. Knowing that the world is a toilet full of shit doesn't mean now that you have to go do something about a clogged toilet. You just walk away. You don't have to clean the toilet. That in fact, you found it a toilet full of shit, leave it a toilet full of shit. It's not your problem. And you can walk away from it with the attitude of, wow, I'm glad I don't have to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, true, true.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to fix the world, it ain't broken.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or we can come in and try to fix it, but do it in a more intelligent way, because we're not attached to what's happening in the world.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know the intelligence will spread shit all over the place.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? I guess I didn't have as much distance as I was thinking. With more distance, I would have seen that it's like not even worth it to engage with at all.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there is always shit to do. I mean, there's always shit everywhere. That's what life is. Everything you eat turns to shit. Isn't that marvelous? I mean, isn't that wonderful that everything you eat turns to shit?

**Speaker B:** In a sense, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because what would you look like if it didn't?

**Speaker B:** Good point. Very, very good point. We would be like 1% human, 90% shit. Yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there is shit everywhere. So what? You're going to try to have a universe without it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's how we get started though, is by going back and getting into seclusion, getting away from all the shit and getting the mind straightened out. And then slowly, slowly we start dealing with shit until we recognize we don't have to deal with this shit anymore.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. Yeah, so into seclusion. Get into a wholesome state of mind, then we leave seclusion and continue with that wholesome state of mind. And.

**Speaker A:** Then we go get our hands dirty again, and then we watch what's happened. Okay, we go try to clean up some shit, we wind up being covered with shit. Wait a minute, let me go into seclusion and clean this stuff off again. And we do that a half a dozen or more times, maybe 40 or 50, or maybe 4 or 500 times until we eventually stop dealing with that shit and just leave it as shit, because all you're going to do is just get covered with shit. That's the only thing that's going to happen. Your choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it sucks as well, because I suppose— I mean, it doesn't— I mean, this is this is me, this is me covering myself in the shit. And I do see that, but I feel like I have like compassion for like the people who live in the shit. And you want to like—.

**Speaker A:** Oh, absolutely. And they deserve a smile.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** They deserve a helping hand, but they're going to try to grab you by the arm and pull you into their shit. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** They will do that. That's what most compassion is. Most compassion is being grabbed by the arm and pulled into the shit.

**Speaker B:** I have a question. So basically, my immediate reaction as soon as I myself am not covered in feces is that I want to help other people. That's like the immediate kind of reaction. I think that's pretty normal, I guess. It is like to want to help others. It's like the compassion. It's like, now I'm not suffering. Oh, there are a lot of people suffering. Now I need to help them. That's— but that's also, um, unwise then.

**Speaker A:** Even though— look at it in the sense of gift giving, that you can't right now pull them out of their shit, but at least you can give them, uh, a gift. The smallest gift you can give is really quite valuable, depending upon the circumstances, and that is the gift of a smile. Yeah, just to give them a smile, that will help a lot. The other, the next one, which is a little bit more difficult to do, is to give them the gift of joy. Get them to start relax, to laugh, tell them a joke. Get them to stop thinking about whatever it was that covered them with shit. Because there's this— the analogy is there that shit is actually old. It's in the past. Shit's something that needs to be buried. It's like the dead. Okay, so That's the way of looking at it, is that we need to get someone, if we have compassion, is to get them out of their past-future shit and get them into the here-now. Start dealing with it, which is exactly what we did with you when you were out on a run feeling miserable and saying, well, next time. All right. And what did I do? I said, no, let's go. Back to the right now. So that's the Mudita, is to bring them into the present moment.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. You bring them out of all their mental shit and you bring them into, into the present. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You don't wish them into being happy. You have to have skills of walking into that fire and not get burned, right? So that you take your fire hose in there and spread some joy around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that takes a skill, and that skill is to develop in seclusion, right? Because you put out your own fires and get yourself into a good state, then you could begin to learn how to do that with other people. You can learn to tease someone who's angry in just the right way to get them to see that this is not useful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's a really good point because then now they're laughing and smiling. They're not more angry. You didn't go overbalanced with it where they're now more angry that you tease them. You hit just the middle way, right? Just the right amount of teasing and now they're smiling and it's actually brought them out. And it's like, yeah, it's that middle way thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, get them to look at the humor of the situation.

**Speaker B:** I got you, I got you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like saying, yeah, that bank must be run by a bunch of idiots. So you can agree with them. That's one of the things that helps get people out of anger, is just, okay, I agree with you. Ain't it awful?

**Speaker B:** Ain't it awful? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's actually like the more kind thing in that situation is to agree with them and say like, yeah, you're right, basically. Like, let them be right and then they'll be happy that they're right and that will make them like more into the present moment and stuff because now they're like happier and stuff. Yeah, that's cool.

**Speaker A:** That's great. Okay, well, let's finish now and I'll go off to see if Laurent's still on the, uh, the tube.

**Speaker B:** Wonderful. Thank you, Dhammarato. This has been really helpful once again. I'll call you again in, uh, in a couple days.

**Speaker A:** I like that.

**Speaker B:** But, you know, awesome. Great.

**Speaker A:** I like— I'd like to see you, Robert. I'm really enjoying you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you. I enjoy our company too. It's wonderful. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, ciao.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named Robert (Speaker B), focuses on integrating mindfulness and a wholesome "winner's attitude" into daily life to overcome suffering (Dukkha) and cultivate satisfaction (Sukkha). Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Practice: Frequent, Short Sessions of Seclusion**
*   **Structure:** Instead of one long meditation, practice 6 short (5-10 minute) sessions daily. This builds the "rhythm" of remembrance.
*   **Suggested Times:** Upon waking in bed, during commute (mindful driving/transport), mindful eating at lunch, commute home, and in bed before sleep.
*   **Purpose:** These are moments of intentional "seclusion" to "gladden the mind," breathe deeply, and cultivate joy in doing nothing. This cultivated state can then be applied to active periods.

### **The Dynamic "Winner's Attitude" (The Middle Path in Action)**
*   Robert identifies two wholesome states: an **energized, motivated state** for productivity and a **relaxed, desireless state** for rest. The challenge is transitioning between them without losing balance.
*   Dhammarato explains the Middle Path is not static but a **dynamic balance**, like having "sea legs" on a rocking ship or balancing on a teeter-totter.
*   The **fulcrum for this balance is a positive "winner's attitude"**—a sense of satisfaction and capability, whether there is "something to do" or "nothing to do." The key is to maintain this joyful, unvictimized mindset across all life's modes.

### **Practical Wisdom for Challenges**
1.  **When You Lose Balance:** The moment you notice you're unhappy (e.g., miserable on a run), **stop the activity**. Just as you'd stop talking if angry, stop running and walk. Seclude yourself mentally to recollect and re-establish a wholesome mindset *in the present moment*.
2.  **Dealing with the Past ("Heartlessness"):** Do not romanticize or dwell on past losses (e.g., a dead daughter, past mistakes). This "romantic thinking" creates unnecessary grief. **"Let dead daughters be dead in the past."** See past negative thoughts as "dangerous" and let them go. You are new every moment; don't let past identities dictate the present.
3.  **Seeing the World as a Farce:** The world's tragedies and "shit" are not yours to fix. Trying to fix everything makes you part of the chaotic "Keystone Cops." The wise see the world's absurdity as a **farcical comedy**, not a personal tragedy. This detached, humorous perspective is a form of power—it prevents you from being sucked into the suffering.
4.  **Skillful Compassion:** The instinct to help others when you're not suffering is natural. True compassion, however, requires skill to avoid being pulled into their "shit."
    *   Start with simple gifts: a **smile** or **joy** (a joke).
    *   The goal is to bring others into the **present moment**, out of their mental stories. Sometimes, skillfully agreeing with an angry person ("Ain't it awful?") can diffuse their emotion and open a space for humor and presence.

### **Overall Theme**
The path is one of **pragmatic rehearsal**. Use frequent seclusion to practice the winner's attitude. Then, engage with life, see where you lose balance, and use those moments as "new education." Rehearse for difficult scenarios in advance. Gradually, you learn to maintain a joyful, balanced mind amidst all of life's changing conditions, recognizing that much of the world's suffering is not your burden to carry.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate the principles of mindfulness, balance, and wise living. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Teeter-Totter (Seesaw):** Used to explain the **Middle Path** or dynamic balance. A perfectly level, static teeter-totter is useless; its value is in the up-and-down movement. Similarly, life and the mind are in constant motion. The goal isn't a rigid, flat calm but the ability to maintain a balanced, "winner's attitude" *through* the natural ups and downs.

2.  **Sea Legs:** Extends the balance metaphor. It's the skill of staying upright and balanced on the deck of a ship in a storm, where the surface is constantly shifting. This represents the ability to maintain inner balance and wholesomeness despite the chaotic, unpredictable "weather" of life and external events.

3.  **Robert's Song of Life / Dress Rehearsal:** Life is compared to a performance or a song. The practice sessions (secluded meditation) are **dress rehearsals**. You practice your "part"—the wholesome, joyful attitude—in calm solitude so you can perform it skillfully when "on stage" in the difficult scenes of daily life.

4.  **The Conveyor Belt of Trash/Tomatoes:** The stream of thoughts and experiences is like items on a conveyor belt. Some are "good tomatoes" (wholesome thoughts), some are "bad tomatoes" or "trash" (unwholesome thoughts like anxiety or grief). Wisdom is the skill of selectively picking out the good and letting the bad pass by without grabbing onto it.

5.  **The World as a Toilet / Shit:** A blunt, recurring metaphor for **Samsara** (the cycle of suffering). The world is full of "shit" (messiness, suffering, unpleasant tasks). The unwise person tries to clean it all and gets covered in it. The wise person first learns in "seclusion" to clean themselves off. Eventually, they learn they don't *have* to engage with every pile of "shit"; they can recognize it for what it is and often simply walk away, maintaining their inner cleanliness.

6.  **Tarzan Swinging on a Vine:** Describes the seamless transition from an unwholesome state (Dukkha) to a wholesome one (Sukkha). It should be one smooth motion—letting go of one vine (suffering) while simultaneously grabbing the next (well-being), not a hesitant, confused debate about which vine to grab.

7.  **The Expensive Restaurant / The Bill:** Unwholesome thoughts (like anger) are like a tempting meal at a restaurant. The "advertising" (the instant gratification) looks good, but the "bill" that comes later (the crash, the negative consequences) is far too costly. Wisdom is seeing the true cost and choosing not to eat there.

8.  **The Keystone Cops:** Represents humanity's frantic, unskillful attempt to "fix the world." Like the bumbling, chaotic policemen from silent films, we rush around trying to solve problems while confused and unbalanced, often just crashing into each other and making a mess. The implication is that we need to stop, get our own "balance," and see clearly before acting.

9.  **Romantic Thinking:** Contrasted with "heartless" realism. Romantic thinking is seeing the world through a filter of how we *wish* it were (e.g., "happily ever after," clinging to past identities). It's a form of delusion that leads to suffering. Getting "heartless" means seeing reality without that sentimental filter.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Sutta Story of the Running Man:** From the **Sutta Nipata**. A man is running, then asks himself why he runs when he could walk. Then why walk in the sun when he could stand in the shade? Then why stand when he could sit? Then why sit when he could lie down? The point is **immediate application**. If you're suffering in an activity (like Robert on his run), *stop*. Change the condition *right now* (run → walk → stand → sit) until you find a point where you can "gladden the mind" again.

2.  **The Man Grieving His Dead Daughter:** An extended example to illustrate clinging to the past and false identity. The man is miserable because he keeps identifying as a "father with a dead daughter." The speaker argues he is *no longer a dad*; that role is in the past. By clinging to that old identity and its associated thoughts, he creates unnecessary, ongoing grief. The lesson is to see thoughts of loss as "dangerous" and to let past roles go, embracing who you are *now*.

3.  **The Four Win/Lose Quadrants:** Referenced briefly (Win-Win, Win-Lose [criminal], Lose-Win [helpless victim], Lose-Lose [stupid]). This is a framework for evaluating actions and states of mind. The goal is to cultivate the "win-win" attitude where your actions benefit both yourself and others.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the practice as: developing **dynamic balance** (Teeter-Totter/Sea Legs) through **deliberate rehearsal** (Dress Rehearsal) so you can skillfully **select wholesome states** (Conveyor Belt) and **avoid the "shit"** (Toilet) of the world, all while maintaining a **realistic, non-romantic view** and the ability to act with **humor and compassion** from a place of stability.
