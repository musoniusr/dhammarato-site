### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, welcome to Sunday afternoon call. Today we'll talk on several topics, and if anybody has any questions, go ahead and let it be known. Skype has a little hand waving signal, but Discord doesn't, so the best thing to do is to turn your video on if you don't have it on, and then wave. That will give us attention. Okay, so the first thing to talk about is the distinction between Kilesa and Asava. Now, they're kind of interchangeable, but one has the quality of being bound up. You can think of a ball and chain, and actually the chain is not so much— that's, uh, that was what we'd be calling a fetter, and that's how, uh, kilesa is often translated as a fetter. But really what slows you down is that ball that you have to carry with that chain. Or if you're, uh, fettered, uh, or bound up, but let's say with a rope An example would be handcuffs. Handcuffs are a kind of fetter, but if you're handcuffed to a tree or a pole or a post, that's what makes it a kilesa, that you're bound up, you're stopped, you can't proceed. As opposed to the word asava, which has more to do with a canker, That's what's often translated as canker, but we can think of it as a— by the way, how many people have the word canker in their vocabulary? It's an ancient word. Somehow or another, the language that was used in the 1880s gets bound up into modern times, just like the King James Version of the Bible. Is quoted when it's such a bad translation, but it was the one that was available for such a long period of time. So canker can also be thought of as a pus pocket, or even a pimple that's sore, and when you touch it, it hurts, and that the right thing to do is to remove it. And we can think of that asaba as happening right now. But some people, especially like teenagers who have a boil or a sore pimple, that once they squeeze it, it doesn't all come out. So they got to squeeze it again. And then when it does come out they need to do it again because another one shows up. Or you can think about it as a blackhead, and once you remove the blackhead, there's only one thing to do, and that is search for more blackheads and pull it out too. So the distinction then between asava and Kilesa would be that asaba is an ongoing process of removing unwholesome thoughts, one after another after another as they occur. To where kilesa, like a ball and chain, sounds like that once you're free, you're free. That once you would, let us say, saw through the chain to remove the ball and chain, you're not going to go put that ball and chain back on. And yet you find you are chained up again or bound up again. So in a way, you could say that Asava is a little bit more accurate in the sense of the way that we practice. All right, Jamie, does that answer that question for you? Anagami. Does that answer that question for you? Can anybody hear me? Everybody hear me?

**Speaker B:** Oh, sorry, can you hear me? Uh, I, I was— yeah, it does answer my question, thanks. I was wondering about the four arsamas, because there's— I think it's sensuality is one of them, and then you've got wrong view, becoming is another.

**Speaker C:** And then.

**Speaker B:** I forget the third one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, perhaps Karuna can help you out with that because he just posted it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** Is it about the fetters, the 10 fetters?

**Speaker B:** No, no, the arthavas, the 4 arthavas.

**Speaker A:** I'm actually curious as to where you got that information, Jamie.

**Speaker D:** I don't know, I've never heard. I don't know that word.

**Speaker A:** In the Saba Asava Sutta, it says that there are taints to be eliminated through knowledge, and the asavas there are actually quite different. One would be the four requisites that you could say that that asava is being taken care of by doing. Other asavas would be dealt with by avoiding them. For instance, avoiding cesspools, avoiding stepping in your own toilet, Avoiding going to the red light district, etc., like that. But the asavas that have to do with knowledge refer to the three first fetters. In that regard, the fetters and the asavas can be seen interrelated. Now, Actually, just last week we talked about the 10 fetters and pointed out that many of the fetters are actually what you would call counterfeit Dharma, that almost everything that was added to the original teachings of the Buddha is actually counterproductive and therefore counterfeit. Now, what do I mean by that is that the original teachings of the Buddha is immediate, can be seen right here, right now. It's directed inwardly and it is available to those who are going to look. So Anapanasati, Upadana, Anicca, those words indicate that the actual teachings of the Buddha, you can get immediate results. If you practice the Eightfold Noble Path for the very first time, you should get amazing results the very first time, within the first 3-5 minutes if you're practicing correctly. To where much of the literature that you will find has to do with a gradual path, a gradual group. An example of that is the Ten Oxen that were recently posted, to where 10 steps long. Also, anything that's in the Vasudhi Marga has to do with a gradual path, a gradual opening, to where the immediate path, the only thing that's gradual about it is that you're gradually developing skills. And the skills that you're gradually developing would be the skill of remembering to look. Another gradual skill that can be developed is the skill of recognizing Dukkha very quickly. "Aha, I see you!" Immediately. Another skill that is developed would be the skill of effort in the sense that in the very beginning, it's kind of especially, let us say, the second 5 minutes that it seems because you have to keep doing it over and over again, oh, what's the use? I don't have the skill built up and I'm kind of out of effort right now. But as that develops as a skill, it actually comes to the point of being an energetic place. The next skill that's to be developed would be the skill— actually, I'm jumping a little bit when I say the next one, but it's on the Eightfold Noble Path, and that is the skill of changing one's attitude. Because the first thing that we do is begin to change the mind from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. And then eventually, like within a short period of time, let's say a week or so, you begin to change your attitude from being the victim to where all the world is out to do me harm. Oh, this practice is hard. 'Oh, I need help. I need a teacher. I need a guru.' All of these are victim's positions or points. Into changing that attitude into the attitude of a winner, which would mean, 'I've got this. Wow, this works. This stuff is really great. Wow, I can do this.' Those are attitude words that come from a a change of attitude. Fritz Perls used the term of top dog versus underdog. Everybody's born as a victim. Everybody is born as an underdog. Everybody's got a top dog on top of them until you wake up and you look and you find out that any big dog that's on top of you is you too. And all you have to do is change your attitude from being the underdog to being the top dog. Because you're both of them. So another kind of skill that could be immediately developed and developed more and more over time, making the shift now from the Eightfold Noble Path into the practice of Anapanasati, that looking would be the step 9, and it adds a point of gladdening the mind, which would be the same thing as changing our thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome. But really, gladdening the mind means that we're changing that attitude from being a loser to being a winner. Now I have a question for you, Timo. How long does it take to change your attitude from being a victim being the underdog to being a top dog? Is that a gradual process, or can you just do it?

**Speaker B:** I would say as soon as you can see it, you can do it. Because I think the problem is we.

**Speaker A:** Don'T realize we can just do it.

**Speaker B:** That's why we're stuck, like, sometimes. But then, oh, wait a minute, I have this attitude, and I'm the one who makes myself have this attitude, so I can just as well drop it, and then you can do it immediately.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the whole point. Isn't that marvelous? That the real teaching of the Buddha can be done within, let us say, a second or two. To do all the things necessary. One, to remember to look at the fact that you just had an underdog thought, and now I can change that thought with right effort to be the top dog. How long does that take? I would say probably 4 or 5 tenths of a second, about a half second altogether. And seconds are pretty fast. Tick, tick, tick. In about half that time, you can just jump. Wow, I'm okay! That's all there is to it. Now, as we develop that skill, the okayness gets bigger and bigger and better and better. But let us say once you cross that line from unwholesome to wholesome, it's kind of downhill all the way, because as you do that, you're developing the skills. Now, let's go back then to talk about what is the major skill. The major skill is to develop the point that all of your problems, all of your Clinging actually comes from one point. If there is clinging, is there not also a clinger and a cling-on-to? That's a duality. Look at my arm here, and if I cling to it, grabbing a hold of it like that, where does the rest of the arm go? Back to me. All right, so any clinging actually creates a self. And when you're not clinging to anything— any ideas, any material goods, and sights you see, anything that you want, any jealousies, any envies, any 'oh, he's smart, I wish I was smart like him'— Karwan, all of that is selfishness. All right? So we can actually say then that probably a bad translation would be this anatta, the Pali word anatta, should be or could possibly be translated as that selfishness is not permanent. It temporarily arises. That in fact the word itself, Anatta, doesn't have the word self in it at all. The Atta is actually a soul, just like Mahatma Gandhi, that Maha Atta. He is known as a great soul. So if we see that great soul inside of ourselves as a permanent everlasting, unchanging thing, that's kind of ignorance. But if you start looking closely, you'll see that sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Sometimes you think you are, and sometimes you're not paying attention to that because you're off somewhere else. For instance, if you're reading a book and actually reading the book, then you're taking in the information. If you start reading a book and start thinking about what you're reading in the book, then you're not reading it anymore, you're thinking about it, and that thinking is the you that pops up. So if you can read without interpreting it or thinking about it or musing over it, because all of that is the self that does this. Last time we talked about the way that the Vasudhi Marga has the top 5, or what they call the Arupa Fetters, is actually just various ways of seeing selfishness. One of them is clinging to being. The old lady doesn't want to die. My grandmother spent 10 years bedbound. We had a hoist, cost me $350 to pump her up in the air so that we could change her sheets because she was crapping on herself. But she refused to die, mostly because she was scared that she wouldn't be getting what we referred to in the family as an Anagami in heaven. She didn't even have the floorboards laid, but she wasn't doing anything except laying there selfishly avoiding dying. She was clinging to life. We call that rupa-raga. Raga is a deep, deep clinging, and she was holding on and clinging to life. Everybody does that, by the way. Everybody who is trained anyhow.

**Speaker B:** The other.

**Speaker A:** One, the second one, would be Arupa Raga, which means that we are not clinging to life itself, but rather we're trying to avoid life down deep enough to— you could call that a death wish. Anybody who commits suicide or even attempts to commit suicide is trying to find a way out of their self. But guess what? This self is temporary. I'm not saying that there is no self or that it doesn't exist, and I don't get into the discussion or the argument between no self and not self, but rather to recognize that the real point of Atta is that it's a permanent So now when we say permanent, you can think of it as lifelong, or if you're really magically inclined, you can think of it as forever. But the point is, is that no, selfishness is a temporary thing, and it only arises as that which can suffer. If there is no selfishness, you are not suffering. This is a major teaching of the Buddha, and the major teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means that if you can see your selfishness and come out of your selfishness, then you're okay. Whenever your body is in pain, if you don't like that pain, then that's like getting shot with two arrows. One, the first arrow is you getting the pain in the body, but the second arrow is the one that really hurts, and that is, I don't like this pain, I want it to go away. I'm willing to die to get rid of this pain, is said in some cases. So those are two forms of selfishness: clinging to life and clinging to get out of it. We also have Panna, which we can think of— one of the translations is conceit, but a better way of thinking about it is comparison. If you compare yourself with another, if somebody gets on Discord and does a smash-bang job of describing something and we say, wow, Michael really knows what he's talking about, That's okay. But if you say, oh, I wish I knew what Michael knows, now that's selfishness. There's the self coming in, comparing ourselves to someone else. Another kind of self would be restlessness. Now what we mean by restlessness is the tendency to do something. This is actually built on to the rupa raga in the sense that if you're going to be, You're going to have to go do some stuff. And when we're not doing anything, we get restless to go do something. This is a form of selfishness. This should be very easy to understand by now. But the last one is ignorance. We start off ignorantly, not knowing that we spend a lot of our time selfish. Now, one of the ways of looking at ignorance is, is that, oh, I want to know. I want to know Pali. I want to know Spanish. I want to know that girl down at 7-Eleven, you know, the one with the clubfoot and the patch eye. I want to know everything, biblically speaking, in her case. I want to know, I want to know, I want to know, I want to know. But a better way of looking at that ignorance is, is that I want to know when I am being selfish because selfishness hurts. Selfishness is that which is causing us to have Dukkha, to be dissatisfied, to be disappointed, to not get what we want. This is the point of— and there probably is a dozen different ways of teaching this, different examples, etc., like that. But it seems to be a very persistent question that people have, and that it's actually kind of not only an easy answer, but do understand that this is the very first fetter. Now, one of the ways that this personality view is influenced and actually built up is through our ways of looking at how things are supposed to be. We can see it in the sense of rituals, wanting to do something over and over again to get some point. All right, an example that I've been having is people will say, and I've been in this group, but let's look at a group of people who have bought a lottery ticket and now they're saying, oh, I want this lottery ticket to win. Oh, I want this. Oh, we want this ticket to win. We spent an hour doing— guess what? We didn't get the ticket winning. Now, this is a kind of a ritual of wanting something over and over again, but this is also not direct. We wanted the lottery ticket to win. Why? Why would somebody want a lottery ticket to win? It's an easy answer. It's not hard. Rolo, why would people want to win the lottery?

**Speaker B:** Because they want the prize for themselves.

**Speaker A:** Huh? Because they want to have the prize. They want the money, is that right? Okay, why do they want the money?

**Speaker B:** Because they believe it will make them happy.

**Speaker A:** Ah yeah, because if I got the money, I'll be safe, secure, and happy and comfortable. They call it that. He's well off, he's comfortable. That's what money is supposed to bring. So we pray and request to do chanting and want a lottery ticket to win because we want the money from the lottery ticket so that we'll in fact feel good, feel happy. Why don't we spend the hour, let's be happy. Let's cheer each other up. Let's be happy for this hour, and maybe that'll last for a while if we keep practicing. So you see that most of the things that we do are ritualized magic. Why would somebody write a book? Isn't that kind of a ritualized magic? Oh, I'm going to be number one bestseller on the New York Times bestseller list. Why? Well, if I'm the bestseller, that means I get a lot of money. Well, why would I want a lot of money? So I can be happy. So writing a book, what value is writing a book? It's actually a slow, indirect process. So the Buddha talks about this in some of the suttas, that it's direct. Ehipassiko, come see for yourself that this is a direct path. Agaliko, that it's in this present moment, to be seen right here and now. Opanaiko, these words actually are part of a chant, but this is the place that we can practice by recognizing selfishness Whenever it comes up, this is an easy thing to do, is to start looking for the kind of thoughts that you have. An example would be that if you're thinking about the future, thinking about going to work tomorrow, that's selfishness. Why would you go to work? That's actually restlessness. When you're thinking about going to work tomorrow, isn't that the hindrance of restlessness? I'm ready to go. Or if I don't want to go to work tomorrow, then that's avoidance. In both cases, that's self. You can think of almost any and everything that you could say for an ordinary person would in fact be selfish. And those selfishnesses are built upon rules that we have, rituals that we do. The rule would be then, I should feel good. And then we don't. In fact, what I feel right now is not good enough because I've got a rule saying that I should feel better than I feel right now. And so you could say then that the rules that we make up actually is what forms this personality view. Now we can actually have our rules form our personality in one of two ways. One is by conforming to the rules. Yeah, the rules are right. I should feel happy. I should feel good. I should go to work. I should make a lot of money. Or the other way that the rules can help form the personality is you make a rule that you can't keep. And then you don't like the rule and you rebel against the rule, like you should be thin. Everybody has that, especially fat people. They've got that rule: you should— thou shalt not be fat, you should be thin. Well, fat and thin actually doesn't matter. In fact, you could be fat and happy, or you could be thin and happy. So why is it that when the thin people, they want to be chunky, they want to be bodybuilding, etc., like that, they feel bad because they're not up to their rule, their standard? And the same thing is true about overweight. What is overweight? Oh, that's a rule. You're not good enough. You should lose weight. It's not healthy, you know. And you can hear all of those rules that we have, and so our whole nature of who the self is, is actually a push-pull based upon the set of rules. And these set of rules that we have, the Buddha talks about it as Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa. We have these rules, we cling to these rules, we make these rules, We make these standards for ourselves, and that's what helps create the self. So wouldn't it be a good idea to kind of drop the rules? Just drop them. And in fact, the rules then make you compare yourself to the rules, which is that manna, that comparison again. And so if you've got a rule and you want to keep it, That's selfishness. And if you have a rule and you can't keep it, that's selfishness. And if you have a rule and you don't want to keep it, that's selfishness. Isn't that interesting? And somebody will say, well, wait a minute, that means that everything I do is selfishness. Yeah, everything the 'I' does is selfishness. It's pretty pervasive. We spend a lot of time being selfish. That's why we spend a lot of time being unhappy. And all we have to do is just to see that. I see you, Mara. And basically what Mara is, is that desire to be different than we actually are. You've seen those stories or the cartoons to where you've got a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other. Which one are you going to listen to? Now, if the angel is saying, oh, don't do that, then that's actually the devil talking. What does the angel have to say? Everything's okay, not a problem, everything is all right, you're in heaven already, this is a paradise, don't bother to even kick the devil, just see that he's there. And he loses his power. So actually coming out of selfishness is dead easy because it can be done right quickly just by seeing it. That's all that it takes is to come out of it because we can see that stuff immediately with some conditions. And what is the conditions? One is that we're looking We're looking at what we're thinking. We're looking at our attitude. We're looking at the way that we feel. Now, in Western culture, and I think that this is even more true in Islamic culture, that you're not supposed to look at what you're feeling. You're not supposed to look at how your— what your attitude is. You're supposed to surrender. You're not supposed to examine. But in the teaching of the Buddha, this Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha trip that we go from Dukkha into Dukkha, Nirodha requires that you actually look and see that you're in the Dukkha so that you can make the change and come immediately out of it. Which another way of saying it is, is that you can see the selfishness that is involved with Dukkha and come out of it into no-self. Everything is easy to do. Now, we have the idea that it takes a long time. There is this idea of a gradual path. In fact, almost all of the later literature of Buddhism has to do with a gradual path. But this path is instant. It just has to be done over and over and over and over again. But you get the same excellent wholesome results every time that you do it. And so we do it over and over again. We're alert, we're watchful. In fact, we remember to watch. And when I say remember to watch, that's that word Sati that appears so often. So the Eightfold Noble Path, then bringing it back into the path language, is that Sati— we remember to have right view. And then right view is not a viewpoint about what the world is like. It's not a concept. It's directly looking at your thoughts, your feeling, and your attitude and your body. To look. To look at which one first, well, basically the one that's the fastest and easiest to change is your thought. Takes very, very little effort to change your thought, and over a short period of time you can actually begin to change your attitude. And with an attitude change, you can then change your feelings. These is easy enough to do. So in fact, one of the skills that we can develop is the skill of what is called Sukkha in Pali. In the Thai language, it's suk. In the Gujarati language, it's suki. But suk actually has the quality of being at rest, Mostly it has to do with feeling of safety, that you're okay, that there's no dangers around. You also have the feeling of security, that everything around you is easy. You have the feeling of being comfortable, both in the body and in the mind. Everything is okay. And then you have the big one. The great, great big one is satisfaction. Why? Because dissatisfaction is Dukkha itself. So if you're satisfied, you can let go. If you're not satisfied, you're going to hang on, you're going to cling, you're going to try to change it, you're going to be unhappy. But if you stop clinging, then who is there to cling? So by stopping the clinging and just being okay, that's the actual practice. And as we continue this practice over and over and over again, guess what? We get good at it. And so you come to that point of, I can do this. You can come to the point of, no matter how messed up my mind gets, I can clean that darn thing out immediately and come back and be joyful. So you can sit there in anxiety: "Oh, I've got a test to take at school. Oh, poor me, that's a hard subject." Well, we come out of that too immediately, just seeing it. Take a deep breath and say: "Wow, look, all of that anxiety." Take a deep breath to dissolve that anxiety and come back into a good state. And then continue to study. But while you're having an anxiety attack about you can't pass that test, guess what? You're not studying right then. You're being extra heavy-duty selfish. So when people are trying to understand Anatta, they don't really understand that this is actually an arising of that which clings. Let me say that again. The self is that which arises in order for clinging to be done. That with the arising of clinging, with the arising of wanting stuff, comes me. Goo, the self. And that is what suffers. Does anybody have any questions about that? Karwan, this has been an ongoing question for you. I want to get it cleaned up for you.

**Speaker D:** Well, you just showed me that I'm a selfish shit, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you are. You are a damn selfish shit, and you suffer for it every time you do it. Yeah, so begin to pay attention. I'll go another one. It's stupid to be selfish.

**Speaker D:** I had a very superficial definition of what selfish meant. You know, I thought selfish is just if I take more than I need, or if I take from others. That is how I see, like, me being selfish. But in the way you describe being selfish. Well, almost everything I think, or almost everything I do, is selfish.

**Speaker A:** While it's unwholesome, it's selfish. Exactly. So if you can begin to see that, you can begin to change it. And so one of the ways that you can do that, functionally, as a practice, is, is to stop being self-referential. To not be self-referential. That when you begin to do that— this is actually a game that I started to play years and years and years ago. We don't play it to win, we don't play it to become perfect at it, we play it to know, to see. All right, now here's the basis of the game. The basis of the game is I A baby shower. Everybody knows what a baby shower is. A baby shower is when a whole group of women who know the lady who is pregnant get together and shower her with baby gifts. A blanket, some bottles, maybe some nutriment, a bassinet, any of the things that they give for the baby, and they get together and have a great big party. And one of the things that they do at the party is that they can talk together about all kinds of things, but they can't say the word baby. And if anyone is talking and they happen to let the word baby slip out, everybody's got— and you know what they do? They all break out in great peals of laughter.

**Speaker B:** Aha!

**Speaker A:** I see that word baby come up. Well, what kind of word would you want to have at a baby shower? Right? Okay, so it's going to be a common word. You're there to celebrate the birth of a child and a baby and all of that, so we're going to make the word baby off-limits. Let's start doing that with our speech, and the best place to do it is on Discord because we do that. So anytime that you print the word I know that you're doing it. Roll off, can you turn your camera or your, uh, your audio off, your mic off, because it's giving a— right, okay. So we can take the word 'I' out of our written language. Instead of saying 'I want you to do this,' you can say instead wouldn't it be a good idea to do this? And that way will help us to stop using self-referential. That word, that style can be changed too. It would be useful to stop being referential. If you've noticed, there is quite often times when the writing is a bit confused because the self-referential part has been removed. That's okay. So the way to start is with your language, your words, especially the words that you're writing down. Is to stop using the terms, the words, 'I, me, my, we, us, our.' Don't use those words. If you do, that's okay, you haven't broken any rule. We're not making any rules here, folks. If you break the rule, you'll feel bad and the self will certainly come up. Unless you just erase that word and then feel good. I got rid of the I again. All right, I got rid of the I. Did you hear that one? All right, so this is a way to get started with being able to see how constantly we are selfish. We refer to ourselves, we think about ourselves, we tell stories about ourselves. It is a constant activity. So at least in the written language, start posting in a way that you can remove the I's, the me's. Taking the you's out is a bit tricky. Because the language, the English language, requires those pronouns in order to be understood. Now, Thai language actually is a language— I think that they started doing this as a society so many years ago that the language itself is not self-referential. So an example of that would be Uh, Pai, Pai Nai. Now Pai Nai means basically where are you going, or it can be done as, uh, I want to go. And that's said differently. Pai means bye-bye, as opposed to Pai, which has a question particle in it, means where are you going. Well, we don't have that as built into the English language, so we have to have sometimes references to use. So you can use— you can leave the use in there, just remove all references to the self. Timo, can you do that? Can you begin to play that game?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, happy to start playing around with it.

**Speaker A:** Good choice of words. Jamie, how about you? You've been enjoying this. I've been watching you grin. Can you play this game?

**Speaker B:** Certainly seems like a good idea.

**Speaker A:** All right, how about you, Roloff?

**Speaker B:** It's a nice challenge, I think. I think.

**Speaker A:** Good catch. This is exactly what we're working with, is to look at those self-references that is built right into the language. If it's built right into our language and we think in language, look how often that's happening. Now, this is a way of getting some insight as to how often that self-reference comes up. So does anybody have any questions about this? Claire, do you have a question? How about you, Joseph? Everybody's good, huh?

**Speaker D:** I know the other ones are not selfish like me, but I do have a selfish question about that. Can we do the same thing also for when we think?

**Speaker A:** This is the start, yes. And in fact, the only way that you could write 'I' on the page or on Discord is because you've already had the thought 'I' that you didn't actually hear yourself make in the thought. So let's start easy. The easy way is to begin to see how we use the word in language: I, me, my. A little more sophisticated, because an easy way to get out of I is to use us or we. But then the second degree would be to take even the plural out, so that we don't use I, me, my, us, we. Just take those words out of your language. Or if you can't figure out a way of taking it out, then at least use the plural.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** If we've covered that, does anybody have any questions about this now? Are we all good on what is self, what is selfishness?

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato, I have one question. Can you hear me okay?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you. I'm just looking for the box. The green box. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** So one of the teacher actually, he kind of, you know, so he said the one way of practicing is whenever you have any feeling or any thought arise in your body or mind, and then you label it with Anatta. So this is not me, this is not mine. And then just keep doing it for like whatever time, maybe an hour or so.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that's a long time. You'd get tired doing it for an hour. You forget all about it and then you'll start having thoughts of, wow, I'm so tired.

**Speaker E:** So yeah, but he said this is coming from one sutta where Buddha— I forget which sutta was it, but Buddha was saying that these feelings are not your feelings and the thoughts are not your thoughts. And then he's making a practice.

**Speaker A:** Not just one sutta, it's all over the place. This is a primary teaching of the Buddha. This is a primary teaching of the Buddha. When he says dukkha dukkha Nirodha, he says you're doing the dukkha, stop. You're doing the clinging, stop. If you stop clinging, this one who is clinging stops. So paying attention to it. Now don't make it a mantra because you can mantra right through into not watching. This is something to pay attention to. This is a primary practice. I've in fact seen Cole Watts practice this for a day. Today, no self-referentials. To help the monks there to stop referencing themselves. So it can be done in a group. Let's actually start doing this as a group exercise in Dharma Friends. I've been thinking about that for a while. Or somebody's been thinking about it, I'm not sure who. So begin to take the self-referentials out. That will put us figuratively on your toes to start looking directly at what you're saying. Now the danger is that people stop posting altogether because they've got nothing to say except who they are. But if you're practicing Dhamma, if you're talking Dharma, there should be no self-referentials there at all. So does anybody else have any question about that? How about you, Kenneth?

**Speaker B:** All good, thank you.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Rick?

**Speaker B:** Um, I'm all good too, Dhammarato. Thank you for the talk.

**Speaker A:** You are, huh? All right. Can that be changed to, this is good? This is good.

**Speaker B:** I can't— well, no, wait. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. So let's change topics if we're very straight on this. The last thing to say is that this is a primary aspect of the teaching of the Buddha, a major aspect of the teaching of the Buddha. And the easy way to understand that is that Clinging requires a clinger. Dukkha requires someone to experience the dukkha. If there's no one to experience the dukkha, what's the dukkha? What's the dissatisfaction? The one who is dissatisfied, and who is all.

**Speaker B:** That one? Me.

**Speaker A:** And so when you're not dissatisfied, there's no me to be dissatisfied. There's no me that's clinging. So every time that there's an unwholesome thought, probably there's a me in that thought someplace. And every time that there's a wholesome thought, the likelihood of a me being in there is very remote. So this is a major, major teaching of the Buddha and Anybody can practice this immediately. It does not require a PhD in selfishness. It does not require vows. You don't have to go to a temple and do a ceremony in order to start watching your language. It can be done immediately. It also has to be done individually within. So if we're ready, let's change the topic to something else. Ivan.

**Speaker B:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** Yes. There was a question.

**Speaker C:** I'm not sure if it's the question I asked 2 days ago.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know you asked a question. I know you asked a question.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was just thinking about, like, I used the word 'I.'.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just heard.

**Speaker C:** You say stuff about ordained monks who, um, who, when they, who, when they got back to a lay life and got married, uh, there seems to be more, uh, there's a lot of testimony of like, you know, being a better husband and all that, like, because they are more kind, soft-spoken you know, not prone to anger. And I was just thinking, is it has something to do with patriarchy? I know it's a loaded term, but we're just curious about that because, you know, a lot of general society is like men being in charge, you know, like the head of the household, stuff like that. So, you know, I'm the— because I'm I'm the, you know, the, I don't know, like the big boss in the house, stuff like that. So yeah, I'm just curious, does that question make sense?

**Speaker B:** You're muted, Dhammarato.

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato, we don't— oh, your mic cut out for a second.

**Speaker A:** We can hear you now, Dhammarato. Okay. It is well known in Thai culture, this point. Number 2, it's one of the major reasons, not the only reason, but the major reasons why mothers push their son into becoming a monk, because that makes him more eligible to get a good family to marry into. So this is well known. By the way, the other reason why a mom would want her son to ordain is that the story is that mom rides the coattails or the tail of the robe to heaven on the coattail of her son or on the robe tail of her son. Now, The way that you can see that is actually on the ordination day, the one person who is most honored is the mother of the kid who's getting ordained, and that if it's a multiple ordination, then the mothers will be collected together in a place of honor. And so the mothers are very, very pleased if not proud, to have their sons being ordained. Part of the reason for that is because they know that he will be getting good training to become a good husband. So, what kind of traits would make a man a good husband? How about he does not gamble? How about he doesn't beat his wife? He doesn't beat his kids? How about he doesn't get to become a drunk? Wouldn't you consider those three things right there as possibly eligibility enough? Because he has— now, in modern times, the young men who ordain don't stay as long, but the old tradition is that every young man in Thailand would ordain for at least 2 years. He can ordain younger than 20 and be a Samanen, or he can ordain at the age of 20. In fact, there was a system that was good in Thailand for most of this century that at the age of 18 he went into the army and spent 2 years in physical training and became army. And then at the age of 20, he spent 2 years as a monk. So at the age of 22, he was prime beef. Also, there's a ceremony called the Khatin ceremony where the— basically the situation is, is that the mothers of the young man who has been ordained and the mother of the girl have already met each other and hatched a plan. They are the wedding brokers. Monks don't arrange marriages in Thailand. Mother-in-laws do that. And sometimes they do it across town and sometimes even across the country. But normally in the old days, it was done right there in the village. So you could actually figure out that in a Thai village, almost everyone is related to everybody else. Because the girl was picked by her mother and the boy was picked by his mother. So at Kuthen, the ceremony, which is actually the robe-giving ceremony, is done right after Pansa, the rainy season. The cloistered time is there, and in modern times, young men will ordain as a monk for the Pansa period for 3 months. It's better if he does it for 2 years, but 3 months has a major influence on him so that at the end of that time, especially if he's been a good monk— in his own mind he's a good monk— then he is ready to meet his bride. So you could say that Tainan actually has several qualities that make it different from Western society. One is that because of what I've just talked about, Thai as a culture is matriarchal at the family level, not at the political level. That still is kings and stuff like that. But at the family level, the mother-in-laws run the family. So That's a major point, is that the Thai society is matriarchal. A second point is that they still practice, for the most part, arranged marriages. Now, I have seen where boy and girl hook up, boy and girl then will shack up, but the relationship without the parents' permission from both sides will break up. Now, that actually is true in Western society. Don't you know that you gotta— if you got a new girlfriend, you got to take her home to meet the family? Well, in Thailand, it's an absolute necessity. So this is something that you can think about, uh, Ivan, that when the young man in Thailand becomes a monk Basically what they're training him for is to be a good family man so that when he disrobes and does get married— and by the way, in Thailand there are two primary ways of— not ways, but two steps of getting married. The first one and the most important one is the bracelet where the family will do a little bit of Pali chanting if they know. They rub the string back and forth and then they'll tie it around the hand. When I got married, I kept those things on my arm and I had them almost down to the wrist because there was dozens and dozens of these. And that's one of the things is how long do the boy or the girl keep those bracelets on until they get really dirty, and then maybe they'll cut them off. But you want to keep them there for a few months. So this is done as a family ceremony, but that has nothing to do with the government. There is a second kind of marriage, and that is that when you take each other to go down to the, um, what you'd think of in America as the county courthouse. In Thai, the word is the ampo, and that the marriage then is registered. You can't get a marriage registered because the, uh, the mother-in-laws have to sanction that marriage first with the first ceremony. There's nothing about going down the aisle, nothing about the music being played, any of that. This is actually just maybe a Saturday night get-drunk party where the boy and the girl get these bands around their arm, and most of the talking is done by the mother-in-laws. So you could say that the mother-in-laws are the ones who make a marriage. And that's an important point, because if the two, the boy and the girl, don't stay married, who gets the kids? The answer is the mother-in-laws. They own those kids in the first place. Mom and Dad don't own the kids in Thailand. The parents own the kids. Now, the mother and dad, they've got to take care of the kids, but in case of a breakup, the the mother of the man gets all the boys and the mother of the girl gets all the girls, except that that's a way of starting out. That in fact, when Tam got her divorce, the mother of her ex-husband kept her daughters. It had to do with financing. So this is part of Thai culture. Now, what does a monk get that makes him being willing to not abuse alcohol, to not abuse his wife, to not abuse gambling and the money of the family? What has that got to do with being a monk? It has to do with self-discipline. But since we're not using the word self, it's just his discipline that he's learning while he's a monk. That in fact you could say that he's living with his teachers. And so this is what prepares him by taking the Sila of a monk. He's bringing that discipline in, and not only that, but guess what? A lot of people are watching him, especially a couple of mother-in-laws. So after he disrobes and goes home and gets married, he still probably goes back to that wat. Then in fact, he may in fact become one of the elders, like a deacon or so, and he takes care of that wat. That's his home. Part of the tradition is, is that in middle age, he may in fact gives the family business that he's accumulated over to his wife, and he goes and becomes a monk again, let us say at the age of 45 to 49, and then he comes back home. And then in retirement— this is the big one— many, many, many of the monks in Thailand ordained when they were young, and then at retirement they will ordain again and spend their retirement years as a monk. Why? Because their best friends are all monks. All of his family is monks. Then when he ordained, he probably ordained in the village temple, and two-thirds of the monks in that temple were his uncles. And so now in his elder years, he comes back and he is an uncle to most of the young monks at the temple. It's a cycle that tends to work here in Thailand, and unfortunately that cycle is beginning to fall apart because of modern times, modern issues, etc., like that. But that's the old style. So does anybody have any questions about this? Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Uh, yeah, uh, I don't really hear you use the word self-discipline. Uh, it's, it's the first time I hear you use the word discipline.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but it fits.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in Paticcasamuppada, the discipline of the young monks is all about bodily discipline. To fit in to being a good monk. But this is why ordinary Buddhism is taught: Sila, Samadhi, Pañña. That's what they do when the kid's going to just ordain for a couple of years. Basically, the job that the older monks have is not to enlighten him, not to turn him into being a noble, but rather turn him into an eligible husband. To learn your behavior correctly. And so many of them don't even have any instructions in correct Dharma practice. It's only those who are going to last among longer than just the Sila period so that he's got his physical behavior correct. But that's kind of medieval, because up until the 20th century, the actual noble teachings of the Dharma was not given to every young kid who becomes a monk. It was special. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa turned all of that upside down. First, he turned it upside down for the Thais in order for the Thai people as a culture to get introduced to the Noble Dhamma, this freedom. And then Ajahn Po has requested that I, on the internet, let you guys know that there's more to being a monk or a Dhamma practitioner than merely changing your behavior. But that's a good place to start. And the place that we're starting here is the self-referential writings that we do. And so that would be something that you could actually have for the young monks. I'm not even sure that maybe something that they teach them is, is that you can't reference yourself. Don't talk about I, me, and my. Talk about the Dharma. But if you're going to stay a monk, basically the way that it worked was, is that when the right question— when the young monk is ready and he asks the right question to the right elder monk at the right time, that's when he's actually introduced to the real Dharma. And the reason for that is because the real Dharma is kind of dangerous. It's dangerous in two ways. One is that if you introduce the noble Dharma to the wrong person at the wrong time, he will change his mind from being an ordinary right view into wrong view. Oh, if there's no heavens and hells, oh, if mom and dad don't mean anything, oh, if there's no rebirth and reincarnation, that means that I can run roughshod over others. I can have a ball here. I can get away with anything. We want to make sure that when a monk is taught, or anyone is taught, the Noble Dharma, that does not give them permission to go from ordinary right view to wrong view. We want to make sure that they can go from ordinary right view into noble viewing. There's another kind of danger, and it's almost worse. And that is there are those who do understand the right noble view and they don't like it. It costs their family money. This happened with the Brahmins. In fact, the Brahmins actually knew what the Buddha was teaching and they tried to strangle him for it. We do not want noble Dharma to get out public, especially the businessmen. Why? Because noble students don't make good employees. They make excellent monks, but they don't make good employees. And so there's the two dangers. One is, is that the man himself understands it wrongly, and then the other danger is members of the community understand but they don't like it. That's why it has been secret for centuries. It's been— there are nobles that go all the way back I've actually traced Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's lineage through his teacher and his teacher's teacher and his teacher's teacher's teachers. I mean, we know it back to the early 1800s. The nobles are there. However, it's only Bhikkhuni who says, let's let the noble teachings of the Buddha out to any and everybody because the time is right. The likelihood of you getting murdered because you've become noble is very low nowadays. It's okay to be unemployed. It's okay to be happy. There have been centuries where being unemployed and happy was a death sentence. Crusades and inquisitions were held to eliminate happy people. But now it's okay to be happy. Don't worry, be happy, become noble. It's okay to do that now. And so Bhikkhu Buddhadasa started that early in his life as a monk back in the 1930s. And this is what Achan Po has asked me to do, is let's let the noble Dharma out to the general world. Thank you all very much for listening to the Noble Dharma. May you practice well and become happy. Thank you. Does anybody have any questions about this?

**Speaker B:** One question arises. Perhaps, you know, how do you— if you take a discipline like not saying 'I' or 'we,' that's a discipline, but how do you stop it from being a rule?

**Speaker A:** Good luck with that. It depends upon how you feel. If you feel bad, because you broke the rule. Now that's two levels of selfishness right there. Make it only one level. Aha, I see that. Don't make it a rule, make it a game. Just like in the, um, uh, uh, the, the baby shower. It's not a rule, it's a game. It's a point in time when all the ladies can howl with laughter. As opposed to locking one of them up in the bathroom or whatever. See, so we don't make it a rule, we make it a game where everybody can enjoy it. Mr. Ben, by the way, is already very good at this. I've seen him. He may have heard this before. Do you have anything to say, Mr. Ben?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, not using self-referentials, um, puts distance between experience and the made-up one who experiences, and it allows one to just be aware of experience rather than having to feel like there's a me that is experiencing A or B. And then it's easier to just be like, so what? It's just experience, it's not mine. And then dropping it easier than if we see it as, "Oh, it's my experience, it's my pain, it's my sensation, it's my thought." Yeah, it's beneficial.

**Speaker A:** So, Christina, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker H:** Good morning.

**Speaker A:** Good morning.

**Speaker H:** Good morning.

**Speaker A:** You're up, Marga.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, I saw that you guys were on, so I decided to join. I had a question the other day, and I think it was answered. It was about Anatta and what I thought was dissociating behavior. But after the discussion in the question thread, it was clear that, you know, dropping the sense of self and just experiencing whatever's happening, if it's even in crisis, even in the good and the bad and everything in between, is okay. And I think I felt afterward that I should have been more stressed out about it. And so then I wondered if something was wrong with me. And so then after discussing with the Sangha, it was no, it's just I'm at this point have, through this work with you all and here, have been able to hone my thinking skills into not becoming attached to the experience, just experiencing it. It was very helpful even just to talk it through, so I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** You use the word disassociation as if it were a bad word. So let's change that around from being disassociated in the sense of out of it into disassociation is a good thing in the sense of I'm out of it.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, that's true. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So anybody else? How about Jose? You got something to say? How about you, Jesse? You got something to say? Good talk, happy to be here. All right, so thank you. Yeah, we burned up all the time. Is there— uh, so I won't go around picking on everybody individually. Does anybody have any last things to say? Potato, do you have something to say already? Yes, but now language outdated. Now new language, no pronouns. No questions. All right, all right. Remember that it's a game, not a rule. Of course. All right, so Mikey, why don't you take this thing home? Gladly.

**Speaker F:** Thanks, friends, for being here today. If you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and hit that subscribe button and leave a like, leave a comment as well. Welcome to join us here on the Dhamma Friends Discord. There's a link in the YouTube description. There have been quite a few calls lately here in the Hangout voice channel. If not sure how to join, let us know and we'll see what we can do to assist you. And yeah, you can also check out these calls on whatever your favorite podcasting platform is, Spotify, iTunes, etc. So yeah, there's plenty of Dhamma here and there's plenty of readable material as well. We have transcripts of these talks. We've been looking over a collection of Dhammarato quotes that David Mapp put together and heard that Dhammarato and Alexander were doing some sort of book as well. So yeah, there's plenty to read, plenty to listen to, plenty to watch. So come get immersed in the Dhamma. Enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Thank you, friends.

**Speaker A:** Point out where you can find that stuff.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I can find it on OSF on the website. And if not sure from there, I can also find it here on the Discord.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the reference would be the Google Drive. The Google Drive has huge amounts of stuff, and the folder that we're talking about right now is the one that has Dhammarato in. It under the library, and the library is easily available on the library page on the Open Sangha Foundation website. But it's also been posted here on Discord also. The problem with posting it on Discord is that it gets old and is way up there on the top of it, and we don't find it anymore. So we need to be able to post that Dhamma grouping on the Google Drive often so that people can find that stuff. Huge amounts of stuff is there. We've got talks by Sankhara, talks by Dhammavitu. We have almost all of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's books are there, and a huge amount of other literature. Including a book. It's actually book size, is more than 200 pages of David Matz's book. I read through it and it's hilarious. I don't know where he got all of those jokes. It's a joke book. It's beautiful. And he claims that I did it all. I don't think so. I don't— maybe been talking for 10 years telling jokes, so maybe they've gotten into a list now. All right, so thank you all very much. Any last words? Thank you. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** No, I just say, you said this far.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Take care, everyone. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye.

**Speaker A:** See you, friends. Ta-da!

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Adios. Bye-bye. Thanks.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on **the nature of the self, selfishness, and the direct path to liberation from suffering (dukkha).** Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Selfishness as the Root of Suffering**
The central teaching is that **clinging creates a sense of self**, and this "selfishness" is the source of all dissatisfaction (dukkha). The practice involves recognizing and abandoning this self-referential clinging in the present moment.

---

### **Key Discussions & Teachings**

**1. Kilesa vs. Asava (Defilements vs. Taints)**
*   **Kilesa (Fetters):** Like a ball and chain—once removed, you are free, but the metaphor can imply a permanent removal that doesn't match the ongoing nature of practice.
*   **Asava (Cankers/Taints):** Like a pimple or pus pocket that must be repeatedly cleaned out. This better describes the practice: **continuously removing unwholesome thoughts as they arise.**

**2. The Direct vs. Gradual Path**
*   The **authentic teaching of the Buddha is immediate.** Practicing the Noble Eightfold Path should yield noticeable results within minutes.
*   Much later Buddhist literature promotes a **"gradual path,"** which Dhammarato suggests is often "counterfeit Dhamma." The only thing "gradual" is the **skill development** in applying the teachings.

**3. The Skill Development of the Path**
The practice involves cultivating skills:
*   **Remembering to look** (mindfulness/sati).
*   **Quickly recognizing dukkha.**
*   **Applying right effort** to change thoughts.
*   **Changing attitude** from a **victim/underdog** ("This is hard, I need help") to a **winner/top dog** ("I can do this, this works").
    *   This shift in attitude can happen **in an instant** once seen.

**4. Anatta (Not-Self) Re-framed as "Selfishness"**
*   **Anatta is not a philosophical "no-self" doctrine** but a practical observation: **Selfishness is impermanent.**
*   The sense of "I" (atta) arises **with clinging.** Where there is clinging, a "clinger" appears. When clinging ceases, the suffering self ceases.
*   **All unwholesome states are forms of selfishness:** worry about the future, comparison with others (conceit), restlessness, ignorance, and even the desire for spiritual attainment.

**5. The Five Higher Fetters as Forms of Selfishness**
The talk re-interprets the traditional five higher fetters:
*   **Rupa-raga:** Clinging to life/existence.
*   **Arupa-raga:** Clinging to non-existence (e.g., a death wish).
*   **Mana:** Comparison (conceit).
*   **Uddhacca:** Restlessness (the urge to "do").
*   **Avijja:** Ignorance, specifically of our own selfish patterns.

**6. Practical Exercise: Dropping Self-Referential Language**
*   A core practice is to **stop using self-referential pronouns** (I, me, my, we, us) in speech and writing.
*   This is not a rigid rule but a **game** to increase awareness of how pervasive the "self" reference is in our thinking.
*   By weakening linguistic self-reference, it becomes easier to **dis-identify from experience** and simply observe it as "not mine."

**7. Cultural Context: Monastic Training in Thailand**
*   In Thai culture, temporary ordination for young men is often less about ultimate liberation and more about **building discipline and character to become a good husband** (non-violent, responsible, non-addictive).
*   Thai society is described as **matriarchal at the family level**, with mothers/mothers-in-law playing a central role in arranging marriages and family dynamics.
*   The **noble Dhamma** (the direct path to liberation) was historically taught selectively to avoid misuse. The modern era allows for its wider dissemination.

---

### **Conclusion & Takeaway**
The path to freedom is **direct and present-moment based.** The fundamental task is to:
1.  **Look** at your thoughts, feelings, and attitudes.
2.  **Recognize** the clinging and selfishness within them.
3.  **Let go** of that clinging instantly.
4.  **Repeat** this process continuously, which builds skill and leads to sustained happiness (sukha), safety, and satisfaction.

The talk emphasizes **personal agency and immediate application** over ritual, complex philosophy, or gradual stages. The goal is to shift from a state of self-centered dukkha to a state of okayness, safety, and joy that is not dependent on conditions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and the practice. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors for Defilements (Kilesa & Āsava)**
1.  **Kilesa as a Ball and Chain / Handcuffs:** The speaker describes *kilesa* (often translated as "defilements" or "fetters") as something that binds and stops you, like a **ball and chain** or being **handcuffed to a post**. The key quality is being "bound up" and unable to proceed.
2.  **Āsava as a Canker, Pus Pocket, or Pimple:** The speaker contrasts *āsava* (often translated as "taints" or "cankers") with *kilesa*. He describes it as an **ongoing process** like a **sore pimple or boil** that needs to be squeezed repeatedly, or a **blackhead** that, once removed, prompts a search for more. This illustrates the persistent, recurring nature of unwholesome thoughts.

### **Metaphors for the Self and Practice**
3.  **The Victim (Underdog) vs. The Winner (Top Dog):** Drawing from Fritz Perls' Gestalt therapy, the speaker uses the metaphor of **top dog vs. underdog** to describe the shift in attitude from a **victim** ("the world is out to get me," "I need a guru") to a **winner** ("I've got this," "this works"). He emphasizes that we are both, and awakening is about changing attitude from underdog to top dog.
4.  **Clinging Creates a Self (The Arm-Grabbing Metaphor):** To explain how selfishness arises, the speaker gives the physical example of **grabbing his own arm**. The act of clinging (the hand) creates a seeming separation between the "clinger" and the "thing clung to" (the arm), which is the illusion of self. When you stop clinging, the separation dissolves.
5.  **The Two Arrows:** A classic Buddhist metaphor is referenced: the **first arrow** is physical pain, but the **second arrow** is the mental suffering of "I don't like this pain, I want it to go away." The second arrow is the self-inflicted one of selfish resistance.
6.  **Devil and Angel on the Shoulders:** The speaker reframes the common cartoon image. He suggests the **angel** is the voice that says, "Everything's okay, you're in paradise already," while the **devil** is the voice of desire and judgment (even if it sounds like a moralizing "angel" saying "don't do that"). The practice is to see the devil without fighting it, so it loses power.
7.  **The "Baby Shower" Game:** This is a central **story and game** used to introduce a practical exercise. At a baby shower, women play a game where they cannot say the word "baby," and if they do, everyone laughs. The speaker proposes playing a similar game in written communication (e.g., on Discord) by **avoiding self-referential words like "I," "me," "my," "we," "us."** The goal is not to make a rule (which would create more self), but to play a game that brings awareness to how constantly we reference a self.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**
8.  **The Grandmother Clinging to Life:** The speaker tells a personal story about his **grandmother who was bedbound for 10 years** but "selfishly" clung to life because she was afraid of not reaching heaven (*anāgāmi*). This is used as a vivid, real-life example of *rūpa rāga* (clinging to form/becoming).
9.  **The Lottery Ticket Ritual:** The story of people **buying a lottery ticket and spending an hour wishing/praying for it to win** is used to illustrate indirect, ritualized magic. The point is that they want money to be happy, but they could instead use that hour to practice being happy directly.
10. **The Thai Cultural Story (Monk as Ideal Husband):** In response to a question, the speaker tells a detailed story about **Thai cultural traditions**. He explains how young men ordain as monks to learn discipline, making them eligible husbands (who don't gamble, drink, or become abusive). This story explains how monastic training functions socially and contrasts "ordinary" discipline-based Buddhism with the "noble" path of immediate insight.

### **Conceptual Metaphors**
11. **Gradual Path vs. Immediate Path:** The speaker contrasts two models:
    *   **Gradual Path:** Metaphorically represented by long, stepwise systems like the **"Ten Oxherding Pictures"** or the *Visuddhimagga* ("Path of Purification"). This is portrayed as indirect and slow.
    *   **Immediate Path:** Described as **direct, available "right here, right now."** The only thing "gradual" is the **skill development**, like gradually getting better at remembering to look or changing attitude quickly.
12. **Skill Development as Practice:** The practice itself is framed as developing **skills**, such as the skill of remembering to look, the skill of recognizing *dukkha* quickly, the skill of applying effort, and the skill of changing attitude. This demystifies practice, comparing it to learning any other skill.
13. **Counterfeit Dhamma:** Later additions to Buddhist teachings are labeled **"counterfeit Dhamma"**—concepts that are counterproductive because they obscure the direct, immediate nature of the original teachings.

### **Summary**
The speaker's primary metaphorical strategy is to **demystify and immediatize** Buddhist practice. He uses **simple, physical, and often humorous analogies** (pimples, ball-and-chains, shoulder devils, party games) to replace abstract, scholastic, or culturally foreign terms. The personal stories (grandmother, Thai monks) ground the teachings in concrete reality. The overarching goal is to illustrate that the core of the practice—seeing and relinquishing the selfish "I" that creates suffering—is **"dead easy"** and can be done in an instant, not over lifetimes.
