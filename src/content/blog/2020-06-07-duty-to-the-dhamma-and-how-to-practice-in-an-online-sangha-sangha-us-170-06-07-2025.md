### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome folks. This is the Saturday Morning Call. We have the start of a good group here today. We're going to be talking about the duty to the Dharma, but Ivan has asked a question and we'll dispense with that first because in fact it's kind of an issue. What was your question again, Ivan?

**Speaker B:** Oh, just her personality, attitude. Like, is these two words the same? Something like that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so as I started to talk before we turned the video recorder on, uh, we can start off with thinking that personality is kind of fixed long term, that we develop a personality through grammar school, high school, etc., like that, and we see it as kind of fixed in the sense of, well, that's who he is, or boys will be boys, or a leopard doesn't change his spots, or a zebra doesn't change his stripes. This is an attitude of permanency, and it does come from Christianity. From the perspective of original sin, all are lost, and we need, let us say, a guardian or a protector or a savior to come in and save us because we can't save ourselves. So this is actually what we mean by a personality. And that we can use the word attitude as an improvement over that, because we can see that in fact attitude is temporary, that we have the attitude of being a loser when we're talking to the cops, and we can be the attitude of a winner when we're talking to our lawyer. Or other things like this. You can be a loser in front of the bully, and then you can be the star of the show when you come home. So we have that attitude and see that that changes on a regular basis. Now, one thing that we can point out, Ivan, is that the Buddha mentions that the very first fetter is personality view. And what is that personality view? The personality view is that you do have that personality, that you are who you are, and that getting over that first fetter means that we can see through that and recognize that no one is in fact fixed. And so using the word attitude is a much better word to use. And in fact, it helps us to get over the idea that personality is fixed, that we have been changing and moving. The body changes. It is said that every cell in the body is replaced every 7 years and that all of the water in the body is replaced more often than that. And the breathing, the air, and all of the stuff associated with air changes on a regular basis. For instance, coal miners, if they stay out of the coal mine, their black lungs will clear up. So a lot of it has to do with our environment, etc. And so this is why we would like to have the Sangha, is because the environment of normal society is polluted. It's not just polluted with air quality, it's polluted with personality view. And so almost all of the people that you'll come in contact with have an idea of who they are, and they want to show you and prove to you who they are. And so they will give them— they will give their attitudes, they'll give their opinions, they'll give their perspectives, they'll give their plans, they'll give you their feelings, their fears, etc., like that. And that it's better to associate with people who don't give you any of that kind of stuff. This is why we have the Discord group for the Noble Sangha. In fact, there's both Discord groups, both through Happy Gamer and also Dharma Friends. And that what I would like to introduce now is the idea of having a duty to the Dharma. Now, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about the duty to the Dharma. We all have ordinary duties. You have to breathe, you have to eat, you have to go to the toilet. You have all kinds of duties that we have. You have to fill out IRS forms, you have to buy a ticket to ride the bus. There's all kinds of duties that we have. That we just take as normal. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa brings in the quality of we have a duty to the Dhamma. Now, what that actually means is, is that the duty to the Dhamma is to pay attention to the Dhamma, to be with the Dhamma. And so we have these discord groups in order for us to stay focused, to stay on topic, to stay on the topic of the Dhamma. Now, what you will find is as people grow and mature in the Dharma, they will stay more on topic when they're on discord. An example of that is like Karwan and Ivan and Santiago and Anicca and Alex and Jesus or Jesu and Dhammarato are old students. And Ivan, really, congratulations to you for being able to more or less stay on topic. And Ben, I want to congratulate you because you're almost solidly on topic. Now, what do I mean by on topic? I mean by on topic that we stay dedicated to the Dhamma. We talk about the Dharma, we talk about liberation, we talk about Dukkha and Dukkha and Nirodha. We talk about— Alex is really good about posting suttas. But when new people come on to the group, they come on as ordinary people and they want to say, this is my perspective, this is my authority, this is my opinions, this is my truth, etc. Like that. Which means then that they're not on topic. And our job is, Ivan, and all of the ones that are on here, our duty to the Dharma is to bring the new people back on topic. Now, unfortunately, we'll see a lot of discussions between new people, and they're just all over the place. Last week we talked about 84,000 doors or 84,000 dhatu. And when people are on, let us say, a non-monitored Discord group, anything goes. They'll visit all 84,000 of the dattus in one conversation, just stay all over the place. And so it's good to have a seasoned practitioner on. And what we can actually— I'll define Mikey's word of seasoned practitioner means that they keep coming back on topic over and over and over again. They come back and come back and come back. This is actually mentioned in the suttas quite a lot, and we talk about it quite a lot, but it doesn't seem to sink in. It sinks in very slowly. And so today I'm introducing a new term, not just our duty to the Dhamma, but our duty to the Dhamma is to stay on topic of the Dhamma. Now we do get off a bit. An example is joking with a monk about a free lunch, and he can come to the porch here, or he talks about the free lunch at the wat. And I say, oh no, that's breakfast, that's not lunch. And so we're just joking around like that. But basically what we're actually getting at is to keep coming back to the Dhamma. That's kind of related to the Dhamma, but it's not actually on topic. But we do keep coming back to being on topic now. Here's an example of that. I suppose everyone here has seen The Simpsons. Michael, you've seen The Simpsons, right? Okay, so on The Simpsons, in the beginning when they're doing the music and the introduction, one of the little clips you'll see is Lisa with her saxophone standing up and playing a rip, and then walks out of the practice hall still playing her saxophone. Have you— do you know what I'm talking about there, that little rip? Okay, so why am I bringing that up? Is because a band or a symphony orchestra is not going to work if everybody or anybody does that. That the symphony orchestra is going to be playing music that has been written down. Let us say that it's a piano concerto, and if the band or the orchestra starts off playing, let us say, Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, and then when it's time for the musician to come on and play his part, he starts playing Rhapsody in Blue. That's just going to destroy everything, because it's going to confuse the conductor, it's going to confuse the rest of the band, and nobody knows what to do. And so, one of the things that I learned in practice, I remember several different directors saying this, that a symphony orchestra is not a democracy. A symphony orchestra is not a democracy. You do not have a vote about what notes you're going to play right now. You're going to be on the program. In fact, if you're a member of the orchestra, you have a duty to play the music that everybody else is playing. Well, here on Discord, we have that same point. We have a duty to stay on topic. Now, here's another point, is, is that if you can, uh, treat Discord like the practice hall of the symphony orchestra, where everybody is on the same page of the music, then you can begin to understand that the people in the orchestra, when they go home, what do they practice? They practice the music that they're going to be playing in the symphony orchestra when the symphony orchestra is rehearsing. So your duty then to the Dharma comes into your whole life. But we practice, really practice sincerely, though if I can use that word, practice enthusiastically, practice wholeheartedly to be on the right page, to be on the Dhamma. And so this is the value of the Discord group, is it's become a Sangha. The same thing then we can use as the analogy for a wat, is that people who go to the wat, they go for the topic of the Dharma. Now, some wat don't. I would say offhand that it's Some wats are better than others. Some traditions are better than others. When I was a monk in the United States, people would use the wat as a cultural center, and every one of them would use it that way, but the Laotians were especially in the sense of bringing authentic, real Laotian food to the wat to feed the monks. Well, that reminded me of when I was a kid in Baptist church, where the social was everybody brings food for the covered dish supper. And all of the women who were bringing covered dish suppers— mostly women would bring it, sometimes the guys would too— and then if their food is eaten, they feel really proud, and if their food is not eaten, then they feel bad. But the whole point of the church social is to come together in the Christian Dharma. However, they don't. They'll talk about the weather, they'll talk about the bank, they'll talk about the cops, they'll talk about anything at all. The same thing is true then about the Buddhist wats. But an example that we saw recently of the video of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's wat at Wat Soan Mokkh, when the monks are eating, all of the lay people there are chanting. Why are they chanting? Is to stay focused and in tune on the Dhamma. When you come to the wat, you're coming for the Dhamma. And so idle chatter is, let us say, minimized because the people are chanting. Now, the chants at Wat Suwan Mook by the lay people actually are in Thai language, which is good because it keeps the mind focused on the Dhamma, to where the monks chant in Pali which has several advantages. One of them is that it helps the monks to learn the Pali. Then in fact, it's surprising how much Pali over the centuries has seeped right into the Thai language. But it also has some disadvantage in the sense that most of the laypeople don't know what the monks are chanting. They've heard it before, they hear it again, they listen to it over and over again, but they don't quite understand it. This is in fact why they had the Vatican Council in the 1960s of changing the liturgy out of Latin into English, and that had mixed results because people began to hear in English what the monks were actually chanting, and they didn't want to have anything to do with that. They liked it when it was in Latin so that they could stay confused and just listen to the sound rather than listening to the words. So when the monks are chanting, the lay people will sit and listen attentively and not be engaged in idle chatter. This is the reason for going to the wat, is to go into the wat for the Dhamma. Then you can say that what that means is, is that the Dhamma— or excuse me, the wat— is the collection point for people to come in unity, in harmony, in sync with the Sangha. And so they think about the Dhamma, they look at the Dhamma, they want the Dhamma, and that's what they get. This is what we're looking for to have on the Discord. Is when people come to our Discord groups, they come for the Dharma. And what that means is that they have to be, I guess, either politely or rudely told that we're not interested in your opinion, we're not interested in what you know about Buddhism, we're not interested in how you feel, we're not interested in your opinions. We're interested in helping you get your mindset into being a student of the Dhamma so that you can fit in and start doing your duty to the Dharma rather than having the Discord group just go all over the place, having arguments and disagreements, and everybody's got an opinion and all of this kind of stuff. Is actually not wholesome at all for us. Now, one thing that I'd like to bring in on this is that probably many of you have heard about the term Srotapanna or stream-enterer. What the stream-enterer is, is in fact someone who is doing his duty to the Dhamma. What do I mean by that? That means that he's on topic. And so those who are in training to gain the Dharma, this is your opportunity to stay focused on the Dhamma, to become eager for the Dharma, to listen to the Dhamma, to find out what the Buddha actually taught in the Dhamma. To understand personality view means to come out of your old personality and come into a personality that's steeped in the Dhamma. It's time to change. It's time to stay focused on what we're doing here. Gain the advantage of being the Sangha because you're, let us say, on the right page. You're on the script. You're on the musical score. As opposed to, like, Lisa Simpson just off on her own playing whatever she wants to play. Because when she does that, that means that she's no longer part of the band and she leaves. I know that everybody here never gets that, that basically when we see her playing the saxophone and leaving, that's with the understanding is, oh well, she's so much better than all the other kids And so she's better to go off and do the solo by herself. And the answer to that would be, oh no, oh no, she would be much better off if she would stay in the band and take on the discipline of playing what the other students are playing. And not only that, but if she actually has skill at playing the saxophone, she can actually impart that skill to the other students. And so this is how we're going to be operating. When someone is off-key, off-topic, uh, talking about their views and whatnot like that, I invite you guys— I invite you, Daniel, Ben, Santiago, Ivan, Mikey, Dhamma Dude, and, and Karwan and the others— to help people get back on topic to get their mind together. Yes, Karwan, you have a— Yeah, sorry.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, about that what you're just saying, you know, the problem is a little bit, it is an open Sangha, it is an open server and we get all kinds of people in the server and some are awesome and some are mentally not fit to be in the group. So to say to them your opinion, if you say to me, Karwan, your opinion doesn't matter, Karwan, your truth doesn't matter, I'm stable enough to be able to listen to you and to know where you are coming from. But saying that to some people can be dangerous, maybe even.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say that they get ticked off because they don't like to be told that they're off key, they're off topic, they're not practicing. And yet, if they come on to the group knowing that it's a Dhamma group, They come, actually all of them come somewhere in there to learn. But when they do that, they come to say, oh, well, I want to learn what I want to learn, not what is actually the Dharma. And so this would be the point then that I should make is that the Dhamma of the Buddha, the Buddha Dhamma, is not for everyone. In fact, it's only for the few. As I mentioned before on the Guru Viking, that in the really old days, the universities— Cambridge, Oxford, in the United States the Ivy League schools— were, let us say, elite. They didn't have very many students, but they had a really elite faculty. And that the students came to learn. But now, because everybody goes to school, public school is actually quite a disaster because the students there are now no longer interested in pursuing a particular topic. They're there to share their day, to do whatever they want to do, and that the the actual classroom setting and the actual study is not interesting to them. Only recess is interesting. And so in that regard, we can say that the Dharma is not for everyone because people have their opinions. An example of that is that talking about God— well, God, we don't need God on our Discord server. Other than to point out that reality, the bigger reality of existence, is all the God that we need. We don't need that existence to love us. It already loves us enough to support humanity, gives us air, water, grubs to eat, etc. like that. So we've already got everything that we need from existence. We don't need the existence then to love us. So we don't need the love of God. What we need is to be able to take care of ourselves. And so I agree that some people who are going to come on to the Discord are not going to appreciate changing their personality. They want to keep their personality. And change it too. It's sort of like eating— having your cake and eating it too. And this actually would be the case for everyone. I think that in fact, if you reflect, that's what happened to you. You wanted to change, so you wanted the Dharma, but you didn't want to change that much. How about you, Daniel? Is that the case, that you wanted to change but you didn't want to make a radical change? You just wanted to change just enough. How about you, Mikey? Just enough. Don't want to change everything. Well, actually, to get with the program of the Dhamma, to do the duty of the Dharma, is kind of a radical change. And maybe most people are not used to a radical change, but here's the point. If they come on the group and don't start making that radical change, then the entire Sangha falls apart into opinions, perspectives, belief systems, etc., like that. And so I know that it's easy to entertain people who do that, but the more that we entertain them, the longer it's going to take to get them to move out of their I, me, my position into the duty to the Dhamma position.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, what we could do is, I think what would be a good idea, the things that you just mentioned, if we write all those things down, like the rules for the group, and when new people join the server, they will be redirected to that page. They need to read that. They need to give permission. The moment they have clicked, for example, yes, okay. And then only then they will be— they will join the group.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I think that we have some of that. Ivan, don't you have that? I know that there is at least one place where on a regular basis it pops up saying this is a place not to vent.

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, I think I can discuss that with Mikey.

**Speaker A:** All right, so if you and Mikey can get together so that we can make more, uh, clear, and that in fact we can put that as those, those, uh, pop-up reminders, uh, to be more specific, that rather than no venting, it's no venting, no opinions, no perspectives, no views, no attitudes, that we're here for the Buddha-Dharma and that we have a duty to the Dharma. Now, one of the things that I have said before about our duty to the Dharma is, is that if you shirk your duty, if you shirk your responsibility, what that means is, is that Dukkha is going to find you. That in fact, when we're practicing correctly, that means that we're on guard We're on duty, we're on vigil to see those unwholesome thoughts and to change them. And so this is the way that we operate when we're in doing our own individual private practice. That means that when we're doing that individual private practice, we get the mind into a wholesome state. We can then bring that to the Discord group and practice there. And eventually we're going to be bringing that attitude of our duty to the Dhamma to every moment, moment by moment by moment. This is what it means, in fact, by unremitting. We keep coming back and coming back and coming back. So we should do this with the Discord group to keep coming back and coming back and coming back to our duty to the Dhamma is to stay with the Dharma, to become dedicated to the Dharma, to become enthusiastic about the Dhamma, to become delightful, to be delighted with the Dhamma, because the Dhamma is the liberation. But someone's individual ideas or perspectives or this is where I was coming from. Here's an example of that. Someone used the classic N-word, and I called him out, and he says, well, here in southern Florida, I have a lot of black friends, and it's okay to use that word. And I said to him, that's a dangerous word to use. It's actually dangerous in southern Florida. But if you take that word and start calling people in public the N-word in Alabama, you're going to get shot. And so that's not an appropriate word, but he kept wanting to give his perspective of why it's okay for him to use the N-word. We also see other people who were bringing in politics. There's one guy who keeps talking about his classrooms and how he's afraid of the Chinese teacher and how he's afraid that he's going to fail the topic, and he waffles back and forth between the Dharma and how bad he feels. And we need to make sure that we keep these people on track, that here is not a place to come and tell us how bad you feel about Chinese. Then instead of coming on Discord and complaining about not being able to study Chinese, is to go off of Discord and go study Chinese. Go turn on your television and get a Chinese channel. Go read a Chinese newspaper. Now, those two things are kind of hard to do in Thailand because Thailand, for many, many years now, more than 70 years, has had a ban on Chinese newspapers and Chinese audio like television and radio and things like this. But the point is, if you're going to feel bad about your studies, go study. Come out of your bad feelings. But coming on to Discord and say how bad I feel is not the Dhamma. We have to get people out of that over and over again, because if one person is doing that, then other people will do it. And then you'll get people who are newbies, and that they'll go for page after page after page after page of just junk. No Dhamma anywhere. So this really harms our Discord groups. And so everyone here who hears this talk today those who hear it on YouTube, etc., come to know that I'm putting out this idea that we need to stay focused. We need to stay on topic. But this, in fact, goes right back to the Dhamma. We've heard the word Samadhi. Samatha actually means to stay unified, stay focused, stay on topic, and that the whole path is to bring the mind into a state of unity. And yet when we go off topic, that means that we become scatterbrained again. Now everybody comes on scatterbrained. So the normal translation of the word Samadhi is also concentration. Now, the word concentration has other qualities to it. So instead of talking about the word concentration, let's use the word on topic. Let's use the words duty to the Dharma. Let's use the word focus. Let's stay clear and focused about what the purpose of the groups are. So does anybody have any points or questions about this? How about you, Santiago? What do you think?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think it's good to keep.

**Speaker A:** Things.

**Speaker D:** On focus and to not bicker too much and fight on general chat.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Yes, on the Happy Dharma— excuse me, the Happy Gamers— there is one channel for the games, another one is for music. We should not try to police those. But when in general discussion, in interesting topics, or post some thoughts, or any of the others, we should start to police them. So we can keep people on topic. Ah, Karwan, what do you think about this?

**Speaker C:** I think it's very good. I think it would be very helpful if those rules are very, very clear for everyone, especially the new people who come in the group. And also that it's very clear that this is not therapy. I think many people see Dharma like a way of therapy. They are mentally not okay or whatever, and then they come here, yeah, basically to get fixed. And how I see it, the true spirituality of the true Dharma, it's not about the person. It is not about healing. So many people, yeah, they see this as a healing, as a place to heal, but actually it's not about healing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you're also kind of touching on the point that when you say therapy, that generally means talk therapy, and that a lot of talk therapy is that they talk about their problems. And so they come on to the group and talk about their problems. Guess what? Nobody ever solves their problems by talking about more and more problems. They just create new problems. And then come talk about those, and then they'll invent new problems and talk about those. And so we can reorient and change that around, that this group is not about venting or voicing one's problems. This is a practice place, a place to come and practice the Dharma. So what we have to say is always wholesome. We can quote suttas, we can discuss the Dharma, we can discuss this and that, but we're not interested in people's opinions that they brought with them. And so this is a really important place that we can come to, is to come to that this is practice-oriented. Let's practice the Dharma here on Discord, just like we practice the Dharma when we're in seclusion so that we can practice the Dharma out in the world. Bring it in. And when people are talking about their opinions and their ideas, they're not practicing the Dharma. They're just venting, giving their opinions, etc., like that. Then, like I said earlier in the talk today, like a symphony orchestra, this is not a democracy. People don't have a vote here. What they have is instructions to practice. Let's practice having wholesome thoughts. Let's not practice having a bunch of crap. They're excellent at having a bunch of crap. They've been practicing crap for their whole lives. And so they come on to the Dhamma, friends, and they practice their same old crap. And it's time that the seasoned practitioners remember that this is not a place to introduce new crap to new people, that this is in fact a place to practice Dhamma.

**Speaker E:** And so— I appreciate this conversation. I just want to say I appreciate this conversation. It's good to kind of like level set. And, you know, as a Sangha, agree to how we want this thing to live out. So I appreciate us level setting and staying on, staying focused.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I didn't catch all of that. Can you repeat what you said?

**Speaker E:** Can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** Okay, it must have been my AirPods. No, I appreciate this conversation. Just to kind of level set, things have been kind of like escalating in the general channel, and I appreciate a lot of the students here have done their best and have done a good job to kind of redirect and help newcomers with what we're doing here and the teachings. Of the Buddha. There's been a little bit of resistance at times, but I just appreciate you level-setting now. And perhaps like Karwan said and Mikey, this could be a talk that could be pointed to if there's ever any question or resistance as kind of like the rules of the road.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we could actually use this talk as, let us say, a reference for people who were going to be coming on to the group, that we've got an agenda here. We've got a duty, actually, and our duty is to follow the Dharma. And the value of following the Dharma is that we become liberated from Dukkha. And when we shirk that responsibility, when we shirk that, that means that we're going to be getting a whole lot more of the same old, same old life. There's no freedom in voicing one's opinion. It may give a bit of an ego boost when somebody says, I agree with you, but the ones who were going to agree with them are going to be the other newbies. So all the newbies get together and pat each other on the back, taking the time— the topic way off. And so let's see from some of the others. Now we got some new people on. How about you, Ben? What do you think? Yeah, I agree. I agree with all the points. I think the servers Dhamma, not drama. People can leave the drama at the door and just focus on the Dhamma instead. Okay, Arjuna, what do you have to say about this? How about Cozy in the Rain? Do you have any views on this?

**Speaker F:** Nope, perfectly said.

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that.

**Speaker F:** No, perfectly said.

**Speaker A:** All right, Krishna, how about you? Do you have anything to say? Hi, I've been wondering, actually.

**Speaker C:** Is it.

**Speaker A:** Useful to provide empathy before telling someone something like stop having unwholesome thoughts? Okay, let us say 10 seconds. Let us say one remark, like something like, I understand how you feel. However, this place is not to vent feelings. So yeah, you can get just a little bit of empathy in there, don't mind that, but when we empathize and empathize and empathize and empathize, now we too are going down that rat hole. And so yeah, we can do a little bit of empathy. Just enough. Okay, I appreciate that you've got opinions. However, we are not here to tell other people our opinions. We're here to practice the Dharma, with the emphasis upon practice. And so can you practice by having some wholesome thoughts? My equipment is functioning now. Can you hear? Yes, I can hear you. Go ahead. Oh, again, Jupiter, I couldn't get my microphone working until now. Yeah, I thought we'd be focusing on the subject. If people want to vent or cry or whatever, there's plenty of other places to do that. Okay, so we can mention that. You can go to the 7-Eleven liquor store. Yes, we can even find a small list and use that. Oh well, if you go for the Happy Therapy Discord group if you want to be unhappy. But if you want to be happy, stay here and be happy. So let's do this for a little while. Let's practice together, shall we? Any objections? Shall we actually practice together? Let's not talk about it in the sense of meditation and being quiet, but rather just listen to some of these wholesome thoughts so that we can gain— it's almost like it's impossible for people in a symphony orchestra to play a brand new piece that no one has ever heard. That since we've got recordings now, I even remember when I was doing that in Florence, South Carolina, when I worked for IBM Corporation and I played the string bass. But one of the things that we did was we played the New World Symphony, and about once a month the director would play that piece of music so that we could hear it. And hear it and hear it over and over again by an excellent orchestra so that we could hear what he was playing and then we could reproduce that. So let's do that now. Let's start practicing having wholesome thoughts. You know, this is actually an okay moment. Everything right now is all right. Not a worry in the world. Let's just take a moment to be okay. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. No place to go and nothing to do. And wow, we can just chill out. We can have these wholesome thoughts. We don't have to think about problems. If a problem comes up, we can say, aha, I see you, Mr. Problem. And we're not even going to deal with you. We're just going to let you go away and we're going to sit here and feel good for a moment. We can take a deep breath and say, wow, this is good. Oh, everything is all right. Everything is fine. Not a problem in the world. Let's stay focused on just the wholesome. No problems, no worries. We can do this over and over and over again. Because the number of really wholesome thoughts is actually quite small as opposed to the hundreds of millions of unwholesome thoughts that we have. And so let's just stay focused on really happy, wholesome, everything-is-okay kind of thoughts. Oh, everything is fine. Now, when I keep repeating like this, some people are going to say, oh, well, you're getting boring. And the answer to that is, "Aha, I see you boring. Aha, I see that you've gotten off topic again. Why should I have to keep repeating happy thoughts over and over and over again?" The answer to that is, what's your choice? To have happy thoughts all the time or to go off into the misery? Your choice. So we're going to actually start practicing having happy, wholesome thoughts. Not a problem in the world, no place to go and nothing to do. And the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. Wow, what a relief it is! Wow, what a relief it is! You know, there's a teaching of the Four Right Efforts, and we are actually taking an effort. We're taking the effort to do the Dharma. And the four right efforts are to keep the wholesome, to expand the wholesome, to work with the wholesome, to keep saying the wholesome words over and over again. That's one's right effort. And if we have unwholesome thoughts, then our effort would be to change those thoughts into the wholesome. And If we have unwholesome thoughts, that means we're going to push them down and to not have unwholesome thoughts. And if we don't have any unwholesome thoughts, let's not encourage having unwholesome thoughts. That when we're practicing wholesome thoughts, let's stay with the wholesome. Oh, everything is all right. Oh, well, I'm getting bored of this now. Arahant, I see that. Let's not get bored. Let's stay on topic. And we can practice this for 5 or 10 minutes every hour or so. It will change your life. It will give a whole new way of looking, a proper way of looking, of keeping the wholesome thoughts down and keeping the wholesome thoughts up over and over and over again. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. Not a worry in the world. Ben, you're very good at this on Discord. Congratulations. Continue it, my friend. Keep putting the wholesome stuff out there over and over and over again. We keep practicing the wholesome. We keep practicing everything is okay, and we're okay with it. We're satisfied. This is really great. Then in fact, that's what happens when we become satisfied, is that we become joyful because everything really is all right. I'm satisfied with the way things are. I don't have to worry about politics because politics— everybody in politics is unhappy, dissatisfied. Let's not deal with politics. Let's come back and be happy and wholesome. Let's stay out of politics. Let's stay out of religion. Why? Because everybody that's in religion has their own views, their own ideas, and they'll wind up having an argument about what is God. I saw that just recently. Everybody was arguing about, "Am I God?" or, "You're not God," or, "Who's God?" or whatever like that, and they never even bothered to define the word God. But in fact, I could say that I've got a God, and my God is gravity. Yes, gravity. Why? Because if there was no gravity, you'd float off in the air, but that wouldn't matter because you can't breathe anyway. You wouldn't float off into the air; the air is going to leave first. First. So gravity is omnipresent, it's always here, omnipotent, you can't fight against it, and omniscient. It knows you cannot just step off the curb and float off into the air. It's going to know you. And so gravity is a really good god. It keeps us grounded, it keeps us focused, In every race car, in every airplane, and on every pilot, we keep paying attention to the gravity. If we don't pay attention to gravity, we're going to go off the road and wreck. So let us have gravity as our God, and let us also have the Dhamma as our God to stay focused. If we don't watch where we're going, we're going to wind up having a tree jump out in the road and bite my car. Let's stay focused. Let's stay in reality. Let's not have some sort of airy-fairy God. Let's have a real one, one that will keep us on the ground, one who will provide air to breathe, for the flowers to grow, to have rainfall. Gosh, can you imagine if there was no gravity? Where would our rain be? It'd still be up there. In fact, it'd be gone. It'd be like Mars. It'd be gone. So let's be grateful that the Earth and her gravity keeps us grounded. Let's also recognize that we have that duty to not defy gravity. How many of you ever heard of Evel Knievel? They say that he broke every bone in his body. Why? Because he was trying to defy gravity. So let's not defy gravity. Let's not defy the Dhamma. Let's practice the Dharma correctly. Let's stay in the Dhamma. Let's stay happy and wholesome. Remember to stay wholesome. Remember to stay out of unwholesome thoughts. Let's be okay just the way things are. We don't have to worry about the world out there. The world can take care of itself. The world's got gravity. Everything is going to be okay. So what we practice is not a problem, no worries, everything is okay. Wow, what a relief it is. Everything really is okay. Wow, what a relief it is! Wow, so nice! Don't have any problems, any worries. Everything is really all right, and we can practice that. That's our duty to the Dharma, is to keep coming back to recognize everything is all right. There is no problems. The only problem that I ever had was something that I made up. So let's stop making up problems. Let's not have any problems on the Discord. Let's have only wholesome thoughts. Let's share Dharma with each other. Let's be happy together. Let's be joyful together. Everything is okay. Everything is fine. Not a worry in the world. Oh, what a relief it is.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, the funny thing is, while we are talking, Just like 5 minutes ago, someone posted in the group, and he's writing even right now about how this is a sect. And I've also heard a few days ago someone saying, oh, this is a cult. Literally right now someone is saying— maybe if you can also make a comment about that, because I assume some people start saying, more people will start to.

**Speaker A:** Say— We use the word cult in the sense that it's an offshoot of some religion, okay? Like Jim Jones in Ghana, or Doe with their flying sneakers and going up to a comet, or The cult in Waco, uh, Goresh, I think his name was. These are all cults because all the cults end in, um, disaster. But this, if you want to call it a cult, has been lasting now for 2,500 years. This is the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching of the Buddha has been able to survive all of this time. It has been kind of kept secret because it's got enemies who will call it a cult and try to harm it. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says, oh no, now the 20th century has arrived, it's safe to bring the real teaching of the Buddha out, bring it into public. We can handle people who call it a cult. They're just wanting to stay miserable. It's okay that they stay miserable. We can't make them be happy. You can't make anybody happy. In fact, it's hard to make yourself happy. That's why we have to keep practicing to do it. And so that's the whole point. If they want to call us a cult, I don't care, because generally the cults end up badly. And here we're going to end up Okay, we're going to wind up just fine. We're not even trying to preserve anything. We're here to each individual one of us practice our duty to the Dharma, to practice being safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, successful, overjoyed. And wealthy with life. Safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, successful, and overflowing with the Dhamma, becoming wealthy in the Dharma. That's all there is to it. If someone wants to call it a cult, I got no problems with that. However, if they stay, they can either change it into you've got a really healthy, healthy, happy cult, or they can go. I don't mind what they say, that in fact you, you think that people coming on Discord and calling it a cult is a problem. What do you think about in the 11th, 12th, 13th centuries, where the Brahmins and the Mughals ganged up and killed about 100 million Buddhists? At least they're not chasing us down the block with sticks and stones. So let's be happy that they're not trying to kill us off. They're just throwing words. No problem at all. They're being unhappy. Let them be unhappy. If they want to remain unhappy, that's all right. Our job is to not fix them. Our job is to not tell them they're wrong. Our job is to be happy no matter what they say. No matter what they have to say, I'm okay. I'm just fine. If they hurl insults, they missed us. They missed. They shoot again. Wow. And they missed us again. Don't let people's words— sticks and stones will break my bones unless I can get out of the way, but words cannot harm me. That I have to in fact stand to get hit by the words. I learned that when I was, uh, uh, before even going to school. How many of you have heard that sticks and stones will break your bones but words can't harm you? Aren't you glad that they're not bringing sticks and stones? Because they used to. They've done it before. In fact, it's quite possible that people will actually get on a plane and bring their sticks and stones to Thailand just to beat me up. That's okay, we can handle that. There's actually some suttas about this, actually, where a monk was getting ready to go traveling off in a distant direction, and the Buddha says, well, what if they call you a cult? And he says, oh, I can handle that. And he says, well, what if they throw sticks and stones at you? You can say, oh, well, I can get out of the way of that. And what if they tie you down and start harming you? Well, at least you didn't kill me. And they said, well, what if they kill you? And the answer to that is, well, now I don't have any worries at all. You actually asked the question about the simile of the saw, where the Buddha says, suppose that the bandits got a saw and started cutting off your arms. Can you be happy and healthy and wholesome even when they're doing that? And I remember one guy says, what do you mean, are they going to actually do that? Well, they have done it in the past. The moguls really did that. But right now we don't have to worry about that. Let them have their ideas. We're still just okay. Everything is fine. We can stay in seclusion and stay away from those who say, no, no, no, no, no, you're a cult. We don't need that. We can stay away from that. And if we have to hear it, we can say, "Ah, okay, no problem." If they say, "Nah, nah, nah, nah, you're a cult," we can say, "Nanu, nanu." No worries, no problem, everything is okay. So keep that in mind. That we don't have to worry about those that point fingers. They're not going to stay long because they come to make trouble, and when they can't make any trouble, then they're going to leave. But if they come on and make trouble and we buy their trouble, they're going to stay to give us more trouble. So let's not even entertain it. Let's be empathetic. Oh, it sounds like you got a lot of trouble, but take your trouble someplace else. If you want to stay here, we're going to practice happy, wholesome Dharma. And the happier you are, the more wholesome you are gaining that skill, your skill will grow into a wow, this is really great that you recognize we live in a paradise. That Mother Earth and gravity have provided us a paradise. Let's just enjoy. Let's be grateful. Let's thank Mother Earth. Let's thank actually each other for staying in the Dharma, to stay focused, to do our duty to the Dharma. Let's be happy together. No need for a cult.

**Speaker D:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** After that, I feel good. How about you, Christine? Do you feel good right now?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think it's good because it is. It's practice. You know, if a feeling comes up where you're feeling like you need to protect or have a response for something that you know, if it elicits a response in you, that's where the practice kicks in. So it's good practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's great practice. It's actually practicing having beautiful music for your life. They have the concept of Lila, a dance, a play. Let's dance and play through life with beautiful, happy music. Throughout our life. No need for the downers. So, Mikey, do you have anything to say about this?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, the encouragement has been and will continue to be: post happily. If you're typing something and you notice I'm not smiling right now. That's an opportunity to take a look and make a change and say, you know what, let's set this down and come back later until I can post happily with a smile and perhaps a laugh as well. We have plenty of seasoned practitioners here and so happy to see So many of you continuing to practice and yes, welcoming newcomers in. One thing I'd like to remind people of, both the seasoned practitioners here and any new people who may be listening to this video, is we also have old people in this Sangha, not just Dhammarato, but there's people like Agnes and Jerry. You know, some of these people are you know, they've been doing this for a long time and they're not used to using Discord. So if you're posting 20 messages a minute, that's really pushing away these sort of people that we actually want to be more welcoming towards.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** So let's slow down a bit. Let's take it easy. Let's not be in such a rush to say whatever it is that's on our mind. And let's post really thoughtfully and in a genuinely wholesome way. And another thing I'd like to encourage is start making friends with people you don't know here. Even for myself, there's people I don't know here on this very call. So welcome to give me a call. In fact, if you're listening to this video or if you're on this call today, pick someone new to give a call to this week and say, yeah, let's make some friends here. And the orchestra and the symphony analogy that Dhammarato was using, I actually used to play in the orchestra too. And at the beginning, whenever the musicians first show up, they're starting to tune their instruments and they'll ask the person next to them, hey, could you play an A for me? And they'll play an A and then they'll listen to each other play an A and try to get in tune with one another.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker G:** So find someone to get in tune with. Yeah, that's the encouragement here. So thank you, friends.

**Speaker A:** So, Alec, do you have anything to say? Thank you, Mikey. That was great. How about you, Alec? Santiago, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** I think it's good. I think, well, mostly if somebody does argue, it'll usually be like somebody will put forth some other perspective. You'll have like a some Zen master from Discord coming in, or a monk that disrobed that gives an opinion about what the final end of the path is, or somebody coming from philosophy. And they— what you, what you would like us to do is to give a happy response back to them, right? To try to like.

**Speaker A:** Yes, proper answer.

**Speaker D:** To whatever is being asked.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Santiago, did you see the video where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was talking about we don't practice, um, philosophy, that this is not philosophy? Philosophy is not a practice. Philosophy is just mental gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle. People have been gurgling in their brain for centuries and nobody has ever solved any of the world's problems with philosophy. So you can mention those who bring in philosophy. Oh, we don't practice philosophy here. We practice, practice. That's what we're doing here. We're practicing being wholesome. So let's invite those who want to talk philosophy to either stop practicing philosophy and start practicing the Dhamma Well, go take your philosophy someplace else. You can even tell them, hey, this is a cult. There is an old story, by the way, one last point about that, and that is that you have probably heard the Mahayana especially talk about the Hinayana. Have you ever heard the word Hinayana? You know that it's a derogatory word. Oh, we're the big group. We're the Mahayana and you're just a little old Theravada. You're a Hinayana. Boy, was I surprised when I got to Wat Greensboro where I hear Maha Samsara say, oh, well, we're Hinayana. Yeah, we're a little boat. We're canoes. We're water skis. We don't need Disney Cruises. We don't need battleships. We don't need aircraft carriers. Just a little boat will do. So don't take the word Hinayana as a put-down. Don't take the word cult as a put-down. In fact, stop looking at anything as a put-down and just say, oh, we're happy here. We don't need philosophy. We don't need big boats. We're okay just like we are. And this is how we practice over and over and over again. Everything is okay. What a relief it is. And I mean that sincerely, happily. Wow, what a relief it is. We don't have any troubles. We don't have any problems. Everything is really okay. So Ivan, do you have any final remarks?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yeah, just, uh, also a reminder to myself, yes, uh, it's, uh, being friendly, uh, It's really wise to just, if I notice myself feeling a bit annoyed, irritated, I could just step away. I could come back 15, 20, 30 minutes or an hour later to talk about Dharma if I feel like it. Nice reminder. So thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I want to thank you and congratulate you for spending so much time on Discord. It's really great what you're doing, Ivan. Thank you so much. So does anybody else have any— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I just saw— it's a really wholesome reminder again and again. Remembering the Dharma is seeing the Buddha, seeing the reality. So really grateful.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. All right, does anybody else have any last remarks? How about you, Dhammarato? You have any good remarks for us? Oh, thank you for your talk. And yeah, that's it. How about you, Okidoki? You got something to say?

**Speaker E:** Not really, just that I'm not that seasoned in the practice, but I'm trying. No, I'm doing my best.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. You keep coming back. You're going to have some really good friends here. Happy, wholesome friends who will keep you focused on the Dhamma. Thank you. How about you, Cozy in the Rain? Do you have anything to say now?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, this was a very great talk. Thank you so much. It did clear up some things that I was very confused about what was happening in our community here. Just the practice, just the reminder, just the practice, basically smiling is all that.

**Speaker A:** I need right now.

**Speaker F:** That's really great. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right. Let's see who else. Eye of the Torah. Do you have any final remarks? No, I just appreciate the talk. I don't spend— I haven't been spending that much time in the community lately, so I don't really have the context for it, but it's nice to know that this is a place that's focused on the Dhamma. That's kind of what I came here for. Great. So come and enjoy. Make some friends here. And when I mean make some friends, I'm talking about lifelong friends. Wow, it's great to have friends that you've known for years. Like, for instance, Mikey mentioned Agnes. Agnes is possibly the oldest student that we've got here. I've known her since about 2000, 2002. So I've known her for longer than 20 years. And if you'll talk to her, you'll notice she can't stop laughing. She can't stop laughing. That's all she has to say. So Agnes is a good friend to make. She'd be really good for the women. You can see her as a senior elder. Also Anicca, she spent years with Goenka. She's been nun in Sri Lanka, and so We're really lucky for our group to have women that really know the Dharma. And so I recommend that you go and spend time with them. So, Mikey, why don't we take this thing home?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, thank you again, friends, for being here today. And yeah, Alec posted in the chat he's going to be free for a couple of weeks as well. So if you guys want to give him a call, shoot him a message. And the encouragement here would be do a one-on-one call with another practitioner about once a week. That'll be really worthwhile for your practice. And yeah, if you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and hit that subscribe button. Follow us on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. And yeah, one other thing I did want to mention regarding the ladies, if you are a lady and you'd like to join, we have sort of a separate channel just for the ladies to discuss their practice and how it relates. So if you're interested in that, Yeah, thank you again, everyone. Take care.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. One last point, and that is Dhammarato. I'd like to congratulate you and thank you also for your service. He's an old practitioner, folks, and he's been having, uh, weekly calls for a long time. I invite you to join his calls. Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you, friend. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your duty to the Dhamma. All right, let's finish this. Thank you so much. This has been a great call. I appreciate it.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Bye.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on the **"duty to the Dhamma"** and how to cultivate a focused, practice-oriented community, using their Discord group as the primary example. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Duty to the Dhamma**
The primary duty is to **stay on topic**—to keep one's mind and speech focused on the Buddha's teachings (Dhamma) aimed at liberation from suffering (dukkha). This duty should permeate one's entire life, not just formal practice.

### **1. Personality View vs. Attitude**
*   **Personality** is seen as a fixed, permanent "self," which aligns with the first fetter ("personality view") that the Buddha taught must be overcome for stream-entry.
*   **Attitude** is a better term because it's seen as temporary and changeable. Recognizing this fluidity helps dismantle the illusion of a fixed self.

### **2. The Purpose of the Sangha (Community)**
*   The wider world is "polluted" with fixed personality views, opinions, and idle chatter. The Sangha provides a purified environment dedicated to the Dhamma.
*   The Discord group is meant to function like a **practice hall** or a **symphony orchestra**, where all members play the same score (the Dhamma) in harmony. It is **not a democracy** where personal opinions dictate the topic.

### **3. Guidelines for the Discord Community**
*   **Stay On Topic:** Discussions should be about Dhamma, suttas, liberation, and ending dukkha—not personal opinions, perspectives, life problems, politics, or venting.
*   **Role of Seasoned Practitioners:** Those more experienced have a duty to gently but firmly guide newcomers back to the Dhamma when they go off-topic.
*   **It's Not Therapy:** The group is for Dhamma practice, not for talk therapy or solving personal emotional problems. Solving suffering comes from practicing the Dhamma, not discussing problems.
*   **Post Wholesomely:** Members are encouraged to post only when they can do so happily and wholesomely, contributing to a joyful and focused atmosphere.
*   **The Dhamma is Not for Everyone:** The talk acknowledges that this rigorous, focused approach may not appeal to everyone, and that's acceptable. The path is for the few who are ready for a "radical change."

### **4. Practical Advice & Similes**
*   **Symphony Orchestra:** Members must play the same music (Dhamma) together; going off-script (e.g., like Lisa Simpson leaving the band to play her own tune) disrupts the harmony and purpose.
*   **The Simile of the Saw:** Even if faced with harsh criticism (being called a "cult") or adversity, the practice is to maintain a wholesome, undisturbed mind. Sticks and stones (or words) cannot harm one who does not take ownership of them.
*   **Practice Wholesome Thoughts:** The group engages in a short guided practice of cultivating thoughts like "Everything is alright," demonstrating the repetitive, mindful effort required to keep the mind wholesome and on topic.

### **5. Addressing Challenges**
*   Responding to newcomers who bring in off-topic views or call the group a "cult" should be met with minimal engagement, a reminder of the group's purpose, and unwavering focus on wholesome Dhamma practice.
*   The group plans to create clearer rules and onboarding materials to set expectations from the start.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement**
*   The duty to the Dhamma leads to liberation. Shirking this duty leads to more of the same suffering.
*   Members are encouraged to make one-on-one connections, support each other, and view the community as a place to cultivate lifelong, Dhamma-based friendships.
*   The ultimate goal is to live happily and freely, grounded in the reality of the Dhamma, with a mind that is "safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, successful, and overflowing with the Dhamma."

**In essence, the talk is a call to intentional, collective practice: to transform the digital Sangha into a unified force for Dhamma practice by relentlessly focusing on wholesome teachings and letting go of personal baggage and off-topic discourse.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core message about maintaining focus on the Dharma and the duty of the Sangha. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1. **Symphony Orchestra / Musical Score**
   * **Purpose:** To illustrate the importance of unity, discipline, and staying "on topic."
   * **Key Points:**
     * The Sangha/Discord group is like an orchestra where everyone must play the same score (the Dharma) in harmony.
     * Playing your own tune (like Lisa Simpson's saxophone solo) disrupts the entire group.
     * It is **not a democracy**; members don't vote on what to play—they follow the shared duty to the Dharma.

2. **Practice Hall / Rehearsal Space**
   * **Purpose:** To emphasize that the Discord server is a dedicated space for focused practice, not casual socializing.
   * **Key Points:** Just as musicians practice their parts for the orchestra at home and rehearse together in the hall, practitioners should cultivate wholesome thoughts individually and then bring that focused practice to the Sangha.

3. **Cultivating a Garden vs. Therapy Session**
   * **Purpose:** To distinguish the Dharma from talk therapy or venting.
   * **Key Points:**
     * The server is a place to "cultivate wholesome thoughts" and practice, not to "heal" personal problems by discussing them endlessly.
     * Venting is compared to practicing "crap"—repeating unwholesome patterns—whereas the duty is to practice the "wholesome" repeatedly.

4. **Gravity as "God"**
   * **Purpose:** To reframe the concept of a guiding principle as something tangible, reliable, and impersonal.
   * **Key Points:** Gravity is presented as an omnipresent, omnipotent force that keeps us grounded—much like the Dharma keeps us focused and in reality. Defying gravity (like daredevil Evel Knievel) leads to harm, just as defying the Dharma leads to *dukkha*.

5. **The Small Boat (Hinayana)**
   * **Purpose:** To reclaim a term often used pejoratively and turn it into a positive metaphor for simplicity and sufficiency.
   * **Key Points:** The speaker says they are happy to be a "little boat" (Hinayana)—a simple, effective vessel—rather than needing a "battleship" or "cruise ship" (implying overly complex philosophies). It's about having just what you need for the journey.

### **Stories & Analogies**

1. **Lisa Simpson's Saxophone Solo (from *The Simpsons*)**
   * **Story:** In the show's intro, Lisa plays a brilliant sax riff and then walks out of the band room alone.
   * **Lesson Used:** This is framed as a **misleading image of individualism**. The speaker argues that Lisa would be better off staying with the band, learning discipline, and elevating the whole group with her skill. This parallels the idea that even skilled practitioners should stay within the Sangha to support others and maintain collective focus.

2. **The Church Social / Wat as Cultural Center**
   * **Story:** The speaker recounts how Baptist church socials and some Buddhist wats can devolve into cultural gatherings with idle chatter about food, weather, and gossip, rather than focused spiritual practice.
   * **Contrasting Example:** The practice at Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's wat (Wat Suan Mokkh), where laypeople chant mindfully while monks eat, is given as a positive model of staying "on topic."

3. **The Simile of the Saw (referenced from the Suttas)**
   * **Story:** The Buddha asked if a practitioner could maintain a wholesome mind even if bandits were savagely cutting them apart with a saw.
   * **Lesson Used:** The speaker references this extreme example to make a relative point: if one can maintain equanimity in that scenario, then we can certainly handle modern "attacks" like being called a "cult" online. It underscores the practice of non-reactivity.

4. **The Monk Traveling to a Hostile Region (from the Suttas)**
   * **Story:** A monk tells the Buddha he is ready to face insults, sticks and stones, and even death while teaching in a distant land.
   * **Lesson Used:** This story is cited to encourage resilience. The speaker connects it to dealing with troublemakers on Discord—if ancient monks could face physical danger, modern practitioners can handle rude comments without being derailed.

5. **The New World Symphony Recording**
   * **Story:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about listening to a professional recording of Dvořák's "New World Symphony" monthly to learn how their amateur orchestra should sound.
   * **Lesson Used:** This serves as a metaphor for how the Sangha functions. Seasoned practitioners and teachings (like the recordings) provide the model. Newcomers and all members should repeatedly "listen" to and emulate this wholesome standard to harmonize the group.

### **Overall Narrative Theme**
The talk itself **weaves a story** about transforming a digital space (Discord) into a genuine *Sangha*. The central plot is the struggle between **chaos** (personality views, opinions, venting, off-topic drama) and **harmony** (duty to the Dharma, staying on-topic, cultivating wholesome thoughts). The metaphors and stories are tools to convince the "seasoned practitioners" to become active stewards who gently but firmly guide the community back to its core purpose, protecting it from dissolving into a mere social chat room.
