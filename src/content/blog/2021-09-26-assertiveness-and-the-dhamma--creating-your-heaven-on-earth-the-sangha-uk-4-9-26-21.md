### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Airport travel, have you talked about it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, surprisingly good.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Because the main thing was that because I've been meditating a lot in the past few months, I was not bored. And because I wasn't bored, I could like— so the main thing was I was a bit upset, so I just had some wholesome books to read. And then when I finished the wholesome books, I was just like, well, I'm just going to sit and breathe. And that was fine.

**Speaker C:** Oh, it's amazing!

**Speaker A:** Congratulations, you made it!

**Speaker B:** You know, like, you know, 2 12-hour flights, that's quite unusual. I'm quite enjoying this. I'm trying to keep this up in London, but London has way more distractions than a plane, like trying not to look at the ads and trying not to look at all that stuff, or trying not to get distracted by it basically, because you only look at an ad on on the tube when you're bored.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sort of. Yeah, they're very convenient to grab attention.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they have the ads because people are so bored that they can't even sit with their own breath or their own thoughts for like a few seconds.

**Speaker A:** It's true.

**Speaker B:** And it's like, oh, they're just like not looking, you know, they can't stand to look at the person in front of them on the escalator, so they have to look left and right. And no, there's the ads. So I'm quite enjoying this new setting of trying to just remain present and not get too distracted. And obviously you can be present with an ad, but why would you want to be? Because it's not very wholesome,

**Speaker D:** especially since the intention of the ad is to want you to want something.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's 100% it. I was like, no, I'm quite happy.

**Speaker D:** You can do other things with the ad, and one of the things you can do is look at the artwork, because often ads, billboard ads, etc., like that are intentionally artistic to catch the eye. Yeah, in order to subconsciously get you to want something. But you can just enjoy their art.

**Speaker A:** I just watched your interview about the industrial psychology too, and I was It was excellent. It was definitely insightful.

**Speaker D:** Debbie, when we turned the video recorder on, you were asking a question. Can you ask that question again?

**Speaker C:** Yes, so it was in relation to what you said prior to that. You said vows and oaths are more likely to be assumed be an ordinary people thing, whereas enlightened beings do not really consider vows and oaths to be something spiritually maybe higher on the hierarchy. Is that what you said?

**Speaker D:** Yes, that's basically how you could say it, that you could say that in fact that we can think of it as staircase or stair-step ladders. Yeah, so, and that there are Right, and so there's kind of various stages of enlightenment, as you were, or various steps along the path. And that we can also understand that ladder then, or that staircase that we're talking about, is part of that ladder is submerged, and that above the water would be then the noble stages, above that And then the lower part underwater would be the various stages of noble— excuse me, of ordinary life. And at the bottom baseline would be absolute wrong view, which can be stated as, I can get away with anything.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker D:** I can get away with it. That's the baseline. So that's kind of the bottom of the pool that you don't get much lower than absolute far-out criminal who knows that he can get away with any criminal activity that he cares to engage in.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker D:** We've had leaders like that throughout history, that when they say absolute power absolutely corrupts, what we're talking about is it takes one down to the very lowest quality of humanity. And so this is the baseline. And the rest of society, how do we deal with people who are at that lowest level, is try to make boundaries upon them.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** All right. And so those boundaries, sometimes if this guy is so strong and so powerful and so harmful and causes so much suffering, then people have to organize together to put a stop to it. And there's various ways that that can happen. One is to try to undermine his support. In other words, we can teach, we can talk to on an individual level, uh, individuals who are in his army to try to convince them to leave his army so as to not make him so powerful.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Or there's underground, uh, maneuvers and all kinds of stuff that we can have. But this is basically where all of this stuff gets started is an argument between ordinary right view and wrong view. And the ordinary right view, uh, is basically stating to this ordinary wrong view of, you cannot get away with it. You can't get away with it. Yeah, we're going to make sure you can't get away with it. We're going to undermine your troops. We're going to raise our own forces. We're going to police man in case of individual or family mobsters, or if it's a whole nation, we're going to build a nuclear weapon, but we're going to prove to you that you're not going to get away with it.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:DESVARIEUX] Right. So more intrusive intervention for them, would you say?

**Speaker D:** [Speaker:ARHANT] OK. So this is the basis for war. This is the basis for police. This is the basis then for armies and things like this, is those who have an ordinary right Anicca, and the right view that have a kind of an awakening in the sense that they know the difference between right and wrong. And then they were having to deal with a whole bunch of people who do not care about the distinction between right and wrong. They're only caring about themselves and how they can survive or how they can gain advantage and whatnot like that. Now here's the kicker in all of this. Each one of us Every one of us inside is a mixture of these two stages. Yeah, at various points, sometimes we feel like a nut and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we think we can get away with it, and sometimes we say, you're not going to get away with it. Yeah. And then sometimes the answer to that is, yes, I can get away with it. And we have these internal wars and dialogues between this wrong view and this ordinary right view. This is the basis then for your question that we need to straighten out, that there's a couple of these steps that are absolutely below water, below water level. And so, they're in a conflict with each other, and that ultimately, the ordinary right view brings in the big guns. Because they're not winning with police and armies and whatnot like that, that they're, they're winning by bringing in the big guns— religions, priests, gods. Okay, if we can't, uh, teach you that you can get away with it— because they can say, well, I can get away with it, and then they'll say, oh, the other time we'll say no, when you die we'll get you then. Ultimately, you're not going to get away with it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker D:** This is where the idea of Ten Commandments come from, that ultimately the authority is there, except that going back to that word authorities is ultimate authorities are just as corrupt as ordinary power. So

**Speaker C:** kind of using the guilt and shame strategies to regulate behavior at that point, when it's— when the negative attitude, I mean wrong attitude, have gone too far past the boundaries and past the baseline, I would say. Do you think?

**Speaker D:** Well, yes, what you're talking about is all of the psychological tools that we didn't mention. First, we were talking about physical. But basically, even when we're getting into talking about religion and commandments, now we're introducing the issue of fear. Yeah, which is much more of a psychological issue. Yeah. And then being a good psychologist, you bring in its friends. Fear has a friend: guilt, remorse, rebellion, resentment. All of that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker D:** All of that stuff comes into play when we try to control other people's behavior. We can only do it by enticing them or promising them something, which hooks into their greed. Or we can frighten them or give them an option of punishment. Okay? Doesn't this sound strikingly similar to the Buddha's understanding of the Second Noble Truth cause of suffering.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was going to say it sounds more like at that point all of these strategies are targeted at the survival level being, you know, to use fear would be to utilize that automatic processing whereby people when they try to do something they automatically feel guilty and will stop and, you know, not engage in that behavior.

**Speaker D:** In fact, there are various societies that have grown up, or various civilizations that have foundations very similar to what we were talking about. In fact, what we can say is, is that the old Mediterranean cultures that still exist, but it doesn't exist completely around the Mediterranean, but the southern and the eastern and into Greece and whatnot like that, especially places like excuse me, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, that area, Algeria, around the Mediterranean as far and also into the East, has a different culture than we have in the West. In the West, we can define our culture as a guilt-ridden culture, and in the Mediterranean culture is an is an honor culture. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** And so people have to behave in order to save face in the community. All right. So basically what we can say then is, is that in the Pali there are two words, harī and upadā. Harī and upadā can be seen as different in the sense that, by the way, these are traits for ordinary people. To understand and to learn. So this is kind of a basic, or a child's teaching of, in Buddhism is— Hari is embarrassment or shame, and Upadana is guilt, which is completely different. Yeah. All right, but you can look at it— here we go with the end— with this honor society is built upon honor which means I can do anything that I want to do so long as I don't get caught at it. Yeah. To where in the guilt system, the guilt means is that, oh, I have caught myself, and now I have to punish myself in the hopes that then they won't punish me, right? This is why we say I'm sorry when we make an apology. Apologies can be made without you feeling sorry. But in fact, in the Thai language, the word is ko tut, and that's a very interesting word that way because the word tut is your hindside, your backside, the butt, and ko is to beat. So please beat me is basically how they apologize in Thai language, which is exactly upside down from the way that they say it in America, I'm sorry, which means I have already beaten myself.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and that's the difference between collectivist and individualist society, where I'm sorry means I have taken care of my problem, but in Pali, in Thailand, it's more like, yeah, I have made an error and I deserve the consequence from the society. From the society.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. And so one is communal. Yeah. And the other one is individualistic. One is capitalistic, the guilt society. Yeah. And the other one is socialistic. Yeah. So in Thailand, you live in a socialistic society because they say kathuat when they're making an apology. And, and you're left with capitalism and, and rape, pillage, murder, and all the kinds of things that go along with capitalism because they have the word 'I'm sorry' built into it. In other words, I can get away with it if I say I'm sorry, right? That's part of it. But the whole real point about being sorry rather than saying you're sorry is that the guilt means that you want to make up for it. You want to have retribution. You want in fact, as it were, reconciliation. Because let's look at it in another way, is that if two people in Thailand have a really, really blow-up, a great big argument, let's say between a customer and a store, the likelihood of that customer ever going back to that store is very remote. That once it's cut, once you have a great big explosion, it's gone. And you can see how that's in Buddhism in the sense of it— if it's dangerous, stay away from it. Okay, so that relationship has become dangerous for both of them to stay away from it. In the West, the whole idea is, oh no, Christianity teaches you go and kiss and make up, which means you've got to resolve the situation. Which means that both parties have to see it. Guess what? We don't want to do it. And so now we're caught in the bind of, do I just allow myself to just forget the whole thing and go about my weary way, or am I going to be caught in, do I have to go fix this thing that's broken?

**Speaker C:** And that's the root of conflict, where a person doesn't feel like making up but is socially obligated to. Precisely.

**Speaker D:** There is often social obligations to kiss and make up. Now here in Thailand, they've got a fallout, or they've got a backup to that. And you can say that that backup is grandma, because this is a matriarchal society, and it is the grandmas that will go and patch things up. Between, say, his son and his dad, who happens to be the same— the dad is the son of Grandma, okay? And so she's got a vested interest in getting these guys back together. But in Thai culture, they don't have a vested interest in doing so, okay? Uh, and so in Thailand, father and son, if they have a blowup, more than likely they're going to get put back together whether they want it or not, and they're going to learn to get along with each other and get over it. To where in the West, because of this internal conflict, father and son can be separated for a lifetime. Yeah. And neither one of them is willing to give in, and there's nobody that's going to come in and intervene. So that's part of the difference in the society, you know. And by the way, you can say, well, what about in the West? Why doesn't grandma come in? The answer to that is look at the women's status. In Western society, right? In Thailand, women are supposed to— they're on top, they're in charge. That's their job, is to go patch things up. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** All right. So all of this is that foundation in there to that question that you were asking, which has to do then that what happens then at that point in time Because a lot of people would think then that this staircase then has to do with whether someone is ordained or not, because it doesn't. That everyone, when they do ordain, ordains with one foot still in the water. They're still underwater, okay? But that's expected. In fact, you couldn't expect nobles who are already noble and already understand the Dhamma they would only take refuge within the Dharma for the sheer simplicity of having a place to hang out because they already know how to hang out. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker D:** So everyone who joins the Sangha is, let us say, an ordinary person. And we can define that ordinariness is in basically looking for magic. Everyone at an ordinary level is looking for magic, and the nobility is the ones who have given up that search and are looking for something real now, right? Okay, and so this is one of the ways of looking at what is the distinction between the noble and the ordinary people, is the ordinary people are still looking and locked in that conflict within themselves between ordinary view, right view, and their own wrong view, and were caught in a conflict between ourselves in that level. Surprisingly enough, Freud figured that out on his own and labeled it, and labeled it very well and very properly, but his labels were confusing to ordinary people, and so Byrne came in and change the terminology so that even idiots like us can figure it out. Yeah, that's that dialogue between the parent ego state and the child. And we can also understand it from the, um, from various experiments and things like that, that a child who has been raised by wolves, say, or in the wild has wild characteristics, that humans are animals. We are wild, we are barbarians. We're out there for survival and for getting anything that we want at best we can. And civilization then is that superego, that parent ego state that comes in to socialize humans based upon the nesting instinct. Yeah, that you— because part of the self-preservation is, is that we need to be in a nest in order for protection. So there's part of the internal conflict is the conflict between nesting instinct and the, uh, self-preservation instinct. So the instincts have conflict built right into them. That's something a lot of people think. They think all what we need to do is just to get out of the, uh, the instincts into our wisdom and see things for for sure. No, actually part of the situation is to also be wise enough to resolve the conflicts that we each have between our various instincts. Right.

**Speaker C:** And it kind of matches with the developmental stages of a child. So when they are kids, they are basically learning and being

**Speaker D:** socialized.

**Speaker C:** So they are learning to set boundaries and define what's right or wrong. But by the time they are a young adult, they are capable of making conscious decisions, and that's why I think wisdom has such a high correlation with experience and older age. So people are finally able to see that they don't need those boundaries anymore, or more likely, the boundaries become less efficient for them.

**Speaker D:** Well, just let's look at that, because you just hit something extremely important. We can see the rules and the boundaries of society that are impressed upon a child, very, very similar to things like crutches, yeah, or walking aids. Maybe someone's holding your hand. That, in fact, one of the ways that children actually learn to balance and walk is when mommy will reach out her hand just to hold the hand of the child so that that child can use mom's hands and her steadiness in order to learn to walk, rather than just stumble and fall and stumble and fall and stumble and fall. Okay, but as the child then learns how to walk, he wants to reject mom's hand. But that's all of the part of it. I can walk on my own right now, thank you very much. And then at other times, oh, I want mom's hand again.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and that may be the cause for, you know, this stage where people kind of have this natural rebellion towards the shoulds, oughts, or musts, especially during, I would say, teen adolescence, that period when children are rebelling and they don't want to obey the authority figures. Precisely.

**Speaker D:** So we can take that little analogy of a child as they're growing up, learning to walk, and then both rejecting and clinging to mom's hand, that back and forth that we have. First we're afraid, and then we want freedom, and then we're afraid again, and so we grab her hand again, etc., like that. This is exactly an excellent analogy for how we learn to deal with the other kinds of aids and assistance. Or which we can call the rights, rules, and rituals. That by the time that we're adults, we can begin to see how things actually are, and we don't have to follow the rules anymore. We can look at where we're going. Yeah. And that, uh, it's all built upon safety. That in a sense, um, AI and having self-driving automobiles actually is humanity's bringing that into form. In other words, if you had an AI system of automobiles who had a whole bunch of rules, then that would be old software. In my day when we wrote programs, we wrote rules, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Now AI is different. Different processing, and the AI is there to figure out, and they have very, very few rules. In other words, cars are not out there following traffic rules. They're following a different rule, and that is go as fast as you can and don't hit anything. Those are the only two rules you've got.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that highlights something very interesting, because what has changed for AI is that their learning ability has increased exponentially, right? They're right now becoming more self-learning. Guess what?

**Speaker D:** Your self-learning can do the same thing when you get out of a rule-based mentality.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, that's what I was going to say. Maybe that is the determinant.

**Speaker D:** This is then the distinction. This is really excellent. This is then the distinction between ordinary right view that's rule-bound and noble right view, which is investigation. It's all about the investigation, and the Buddha figured this out 2,500 years ago. That it is wisdom, it's the investigation, it's the power of observation, it's looking and looking and looking at things over and over again. And then we begin to see the territory like it is, and we know how to maneuver. We don't have to maneuver by a map or set of rules or anything like that. We can actually see where we're going in life now, which means that we're going to throw out all of the old rules which the Buddha called Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa, which is in fact the nesting instinct, and start operating from wisdom instead of looking at what we're doing, looking at where we're going. I have a question. Tanha, yes.

**Speaker A:** Can we go back to this? You mentioned that ordinary people see it as magic and noble people see it as reality, or something like— what's the statement exactly? Yes. So an example, I see that— I see the synchronicity, for example. Something happens and I think it's magic or reality. Like, what's— well, what you can say

**Speaker D:** is instead, isn't it marvelous that you can wake up and see that things are almost like that we live in a giant clock and that the gears turn in ratios, etc., like that, and things just happen that way. Many, many incidences. One is that I'll mention a song and the lady who's listening to me in a private conversation says that particular song is on the record player right here. We just played it last night. Another example is I give an example of liking what you're doing and talk about dishwasher. And the guy turns out immediately gushes that he's a professional dishwasher. And this happens over and over and over again. Recently, let's say it was last Saturday morning, that I had a call that had conflicted with the timing of the the Skype call that we do, Sangha UK. And when I finished that call and came on to the Skype US, Parker had just clicked the button to finish the call. And I saw him and he saw me, but the buttons had already been clicked and it was over. But that was enough for both of us to understand this is an instant of synchronicity. This is Brilliant, because it only lasted 1 second. There's only 1 second that that could have happened, that I came on just as he was leaving. All right, but there's many, many things like that. Now here's part of the problem, is that the magic is, is that once we begin to open up and see how things are so interconnected, we get the idea that we can control it. If I only get this or that little skill, if I only got a little bit better in meditation, I'll figure out how I can, I can, I can fix it, I can control it. That's where magic comes in.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you, you, you intentionally trying to project something, right?

**Speaker D:** We start to project on it as I did it, or not look at that, but look at me.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see.

**Speaker D:** Turn it into selfishness. That's the magic That's the transition that is made, and that it's based upon more wishful thinking than actual observation. The more we observe, the more we realize that there's so much of that synchronicity happens that all we could do is just be in awe of it.

**Speaker A:** This is the way you remove yourself out of it, just being saying, just

**Speaker D:** look at that, look at that, just wow, isn't that marvelous? But that means that we're actually looking at what's happening. Yeah, as opposed to trying to make something out of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it feels good to do it instead of saying I created it, or, uh-huh, all right, or look at

**Speaker D:** me, what a grand boy I am because I can see things you can't see. Instead, whenever synchronicity happens, I talk to the students about it immediately, and everybody Everybody says, "Yeah, that's really interesting that this stuff happens that way," that we make connections. But that's real. It's real because we don't live in an infinite society, we live in a closed environment almost, that we are interconnected. Oh

**Speaker A:** no, did we lose him?

**Speaker B:** Something's happened.

**Speaker A:** That's synchronicity. That's magic. Lack of synchronicity.

**Speaker C:** That's

**Speaker A:** not magic, actually. It's poor quality.

**Speaker C:** Manuel,

**Speaker A:** how are you doing there?

**Speaker D:** It's very cool that we're talking about this because actually right now I'm doing my bachelor's thesis in psychology about synchronicity. So quite a synchronistic thing going on. Yeah. It's amazing, yeah. I

**Speaker A:** just lived through one today, just like a couple hours ago, and that was really cool. Just

**Speaker C:** tell me about it. How was it?

**Speaker A:** Oh, you're back. Oh, um, tell me about my synchronicity. Okay, I made myself rice porridge, and while I was making it, a friend of mine who's in the US was just thinking about it. And texted me at that moment that he wishes he had some rice right now, boiled rice, and I sent him a picture of what I'm eating now. And he's like, this is the first time I've ever thought about rice, boiled rice, ever.

**Speaker D:** And voilà.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Dhammarato,

**Speaker D:** to continue answering your question and using the staircase and the analogy and the waterline as to the state of mind a person is in. One can in fact become noble and return to lay life and be of great advantage. One of the major reasons that that can happen is normally because the family will need one. This is actually common and known of, and within the Sangha And this, by the way, is well known within the Sangha in Thailand. This is kind of the way that it operates, is that one can actually become a monk and disrobe and become a monk again 7 times in his lifetime, because that actually happened in the time of the Buddha. That gives people enormous flexibility. That just because— now there's a difference between leaving the Sangha, disrobing moving and going and joining a different religion. That's not the same thing, but rather that you stay with your— how to say it— you stay in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and you continue to associate with them. But now you can do it because of family restrictions or other things like that. An example of that was that I was doing quite a lot of running my mother's family business when she was really, really in her advanced old age. But then she got into an automobile accident, she couldn't drive anymore. At that time, the manager of the organization had quit, and that meant that I had to take even more responsibility for this, or close it down, and I had to make a choice. And that choice was to become disrobed as a monk, right, so that I could now handle the books. Because so far I was successful at not having to do the books, that even though I did the payroll, the payroll was only money on paper. In other words, I would do the payroll, hand it to my mom, and then the checks were written or the money was taken out the payroll was done like that. When she was no longer able to do that, that was the line that I made for myself. Now I have to disrobe in order to take care of business. However, there was also some other reasons that were in there, because the situation that I was in, I wanted to remain close in North Carolina, and that at that particular time, the Lao temples begin to have trouble over who owns the temple property. In Thailand, that's not an issue because when a place is ordained, fully ordained, the deed for that land is given to the king as a present, but it's then administered by the Bureau of Religious Affairs. So all religious facilities in Thailand do not have any political political squabbles. In the United States, however, religious organizations have mortgages on their buildings, which means who owns that building in the, in the bank's mind became a major issue. Because people want to say, oh well, I run this temple because my name is on the mortgage, and I want to sell the buildings because now we bought it for $150,000 and I can sell it for a million dollars now, haha, and you guys can go find another place. And

**Speaker C:** there's corruption, right?

**Speaker D:** And so here I am, a monk, winding up in court suit after court suit, in court time after time. The first one I got into was in Amarillo, Texas, and they actually invited me to go out there. Well, now that I'm a monk who speaks English and knows how to handle American courts, that means that every Buddhist court suit in the United States needs my attention, right? That was a good time for me to get out.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, right. And that shows how dynamic, um, the Thai system is. They recognize that humans are not consistent. And that's okay because circumstances change, right? So that flexibility, I think, is something we all could benefit from.

**Speaker D:** Well, while I was in North Carolina, one of the lawyers in one of our meetings just kind of mentioned that about half the lawsuits in North Carolina right now is over who owns what church property. So it is a major problem as churches begin to close, right? It also can be a major property— a problem when the property increases, and then there's, there's conflict. But anyway, getting back to the point is, is that is part of the Buddhist culture that there is time to go to the woods and there is time to go home and take care of business. Because if you don't go home and take care of business, then the whole group of people is going to be suffering. And what advantage do you you have by going into the woods when the whole town is burning down, basically, when all you'd have to do is just step in and everything is set right. So the whole permission thing is to move in and out of the Sangha according to choices and abilities that you make. So that means then that, that there are some On some occasions, some very, very high-quality, high-class people out there in Thai society, for some reason or another, that they're not all in the watch. Right. Because even though they got that nobility— another way of looking at it is that the Sangha can be seen as a hospital. How many hospitals do you know of that once someone goes into the hospital Even though they're cured after 2 or 3 weeks, they stay years and years in the hospital because they like it there.

**Speaker A:** Nobody

**Speaker C:** likes a hospital.

**Speaker A:** Well,

**Speaker D:** a lot of people like the Sangha. Once you get into it, there's no reason to leave, except there sometimes are reasons to leave, but the reasons are often on the outside— family organizations, business problems. Rice. In fact, the first time that it happened in the Sangha of the Buddha's time was when a man had to disrobe because his mother was not capable of doing all of the work of harvesting the rice at the time, and she needed him to help with the rice. The next year it was okay, and she did it fine. The year after that, okay. But then the third year, he needed to go back again. And the Buddha says, fine, go do the work that you need to do, and when you come back, you take up the robes again. Yeah, in the very beginning, in fact, the ordination was Anapanasati, Bhikkhuni. In other words, come and see for yourself, come and be a Bhikkhu. It was intended to be short-term. From the very beginning. And the ordination was very easy in the beginning. It got more and more ossified and more and more formalized over time due to the influences of ordinary people messing with the Sangha. It hasn't remained noble. Right. That doesn't mean it became completely not noble. That's the part that most Westerners have a problem with. Yes, the Buddha Sangha started out noble, noble, but it got really encrusted with ordinary things we can call Buddhism itself. But that Buddhism that was covering over the actual noble Sangha was more of a protective wrap, and it has preserved and protected the teachings of the Buddha for 2,500 years now. And it was in the time of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa to say, let's let the noble Dhamma out and open for anyone. That this is not an issue of ordination. This is an issue of enthusiasm. Yeah, I have a question.

**Speaker A:** So it's seemingly easier for a man to go to the wat and stay there, um, even if he has kids. Now for women, it's a little different. Because once you have kids— Absolutely, absolutely.

**Speaker D:** But it should not be in the regard that— in fact, we just talked about this— that if a man has young children, then that would be, even in Thai society, a prohibiting factor for him becoming a monk. In fact, there's a whole lot of reasons that, in fact, one cannot become a monk if he is in debt. He cannot become a monk if he is wanted by the authorities for any reason. Okay, so if somebody wants him because of money, or somebody wants it because he's done something wrong— in other words, the Sangha is not a hiding place. This is not sanctuary for wrongdoers. And a man has obligations to his children, that if he is going to become a monk while he's got a 10-year-old son, or maybe a 10 and an 11-year-old kid, or 8 and 9, something in that range, he better make very sure that his family is okay that he goes and becomes a monk for a while, and that his kids are going to be very, very well taken care of. Also remember that every time that a monk ordains in Thailand, one of those things is that you've got to have your mother's permission to ordain. And your mother is not going to allow you to ordain if you've got a 10-year-old child. And so there is social stuff built into that that the Westerners, they don't even know about all these tiny little details that are there because none of you have been to Thailand to actually go through the ordination process which is when you find out about all of this stuff. Okay, you've got to be in good health, uh, in a, in a good mental mood. You've got to have your mother's permission. You got to be completely debt-free. You can be broke, that's not the issue. But in fact, the, uh, the Bhikkhu Sangha has been big with the immigration, uh, in other words, they're both organizations within the government, the Bureau of Religious Affairs and the Immigration Department. Government work very closely, hand in hand, to make it easier on the Westerners who are ordained, but they're also closely inspected. And they don't have to do any of that stuff with the Thais. They let the Thai Society take care of all of that.

**Speaker C:** So that again points to the boundaries that we were talking about, those social boundaries and psychological boundaries that are needed to make sure that people cultivate at least a positive attitude, if not at the level of enlightened beings, right? But once that's taken care of, I think then monks or student monks are probably given more flexibility regarding what's right or wrong, and the boundaries are kind of they kind of start to dissolve, would you say?

**Speaker D:** Yes, not only that, but you're pointing at something very beautiful, and I like that. I hadn't even thought about it this way. And that is, is that people of wrong attitude are not allowed or invited into the membership in the Sangha, that the Sangha wants people of right ordinary attitude because that's going to be the foundation that they need to move from that into noble attitude.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because if you give the wrong attitude to somebody who is— who has— who doesn't have right attitude, they're likely to harm themselves and others, right? Absolutely.

**Speaker D:** That's exactly what we mean by someone trying to use the Sangha as a hiding place for some wrongdoing because they're trying to get away from not paying their bills, trying to get away from the police, trying to get There was in fact a case in the United States where a guy ordained and became a Buddhist monk, and it came to find out that he was wanted by the FBI. Yeah, and he became a Buddhist monk to try to hide from the FBI. Didn't work. Wow. Right, but it worked for a while, worked for months. Wow.

**Speaker C:** So I, I get the teaching video

**Speaker D:** down in California and then got into North Carolina and got people within the Sangha to get his transfer transportation arranged for him, and he was able to do that all under the radar. And the FBI was out looking for him. They eventually caught him though, because they knew what they were doing, right? But the Sangha didn't know that. That was something. And, and, and basically what was going on when he was caught up with and removed, the Sangha's attitude about that was not, oh no, we've lost one of our guys. Our attitude was, wow, we knew that was coming, right?

**Speaker C:** We

**Speaker D:** could see that happening.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the Sangha, I think, is not exclusionary in the sense that people who do not have right attitude are not invited. It's more like, you know, those preliminary practices that people do. So the Sangha kind of encourages people to do the work that needs to be done for them to get included in the Sangha? Absolutely.

**Speaker D:** The only way to join a Sangha is by moving in on them. Robes are optional, and robes come later. But if you're not living— I lived at Wat Suwan Milk from middle 1983, and I ordained in December 1984. I was there for almost 18 months before I ordained. Wow. That's a major point, that in fact they require it now. What happened to me was just natural because Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Arahant Chah and that crowd, they knew what they were doing. Now they actually have specifications that if you're going to be a monk, you number one come and live in a wat for a year as a layman, and then number two you ordain for another year as a Samanin, and after two full years, one in yellow robes as a student or as a child monk, then you can have full ordination. That's how they actually— that's, that's the way that the Bureau of Religious Affairs wants to do it. And in the process, they've also kind of specified that and put Wat Pannanachat as the target for that. So basically, the way that it could be done is that someone would come to live here and spend their first year at Dhamma Kiem under Ajahn Metta's guidance, and then move to Wat Pananachat and ordain up there. And then he could go a year after that and ordain any place that he wants to. Okay. And so that's also the setting up of the Upajaya, because who is the Western is an extremely important piece of information for some reason within the Sangha.

**Speaker C:** Upajaya is like supervisor, the preceptor, right? Okay, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Okay, that the Buddhist ordination now is a formality that requires— or let us say it doesn't actually physically require it but that it is so common that it's, you know, it's an unofficial point that it takes 20 monks for an ordination. Wow. This is Sangha. I mean, this is that we're talking about family here. If you're going to join a family, you need to join the whole family. And so this, even in places like North Carolina where we have to get— we have to plan ordinations well in advance to make sure that we can get 20 monks as a quorum. And so we set up months in advance so that monks from all over the place can come. Wow. By the way, I had about 45 monks at the ordination that I had something to do with in North Carolina. So, um, that, that whole thing is, is part of it, of how big a whoop-de-doo can we make here. Another one is when a temple is ordained. And there— and during those years, there was a lot of new temples showing up in the United States. And so I went to the ordination in two of them in Atlanta, one in Connecticut, another one in Rhode Island, another one in Wisconsin. Wow. Just a lot of different new temples coming in. And so they all want that huge number of monks to show up. One of the photos that my mom kept in her bedroom was a big, big display like that that showed me way off in the corner, up, but easy to see because I was the biggest dude there. But there had— that was more than 100 monks at that ordination. This was an ordination of a temple in Atlanta, big Lao temple, and, and there everybody, everybody was there basically almost all the monks that we could find. Wow, huge family, big family. So in that ordination for the individual, you have the Upajaya and the Achan. The Achan is going to be— not only do we use the word Achan like Achan this and Achan that, Achan Po and Achan Samadhi and Achan Amarant and Achan Sankhara, all all of these achans there are using the name differently than is used in the ordination. That basically the word teacher means something— anybody can be a teacher, and we give them that respect because they are the teachers. But in the ordination in Thailand that I'm talking about, the Upaya was the Samdet Sangharaj of South Thailand, the most important monk in South Thailand. And the Achan was Achan Po. So Achan Po has a different relationship to me than any other Achan, but he is my Achan. He is my teacher. Okay. And so Achan Po was there in the ordination. I got a lot of photos about that if you guys want to see them. And Kesa Thero was the Upaya, that they make a point, especially for the Westerners, to have a very, very high-ranking, most important monk that they can find to be the Upajaya. That's very, very typical that in Thailand that ordinations are like that. In fact, there's one story that is unverified. It's just a story that I heard that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has been the Upajaya for only one person in his entire life. He finally did succumb to political pressure. You know who he ordained? The son of the present Prime Minister. That's who Bhikkhu Buddhadasa ordained. And so that's, that's, uh, that's how, uh, that part of ordinary Buddhism is, is part of the Sangha, that, that the, the Sangha uses all of this status stuff to its advantage rather than saying that, oh, we cannot be status symbol, that, that you're a Westerner, we want the lowest class, uh, Upajaya we can find because you're a piece of dirt. No, you're a piece of dirt, therefore we want the best Upajaya we can find. That in fact, one of the, uh, high-class Upajayas, the really big one, is Arahant Panna Nanda, who was the, uh, who is the chief monk, the abbot of Wat Chulapatthan, the largest temple in Thailand. The largest what? Like 3,000, 4,000 monks stay at his temple. And guess who got ordained under the Upaya of Achan Pañña Nanda? Robert Bucknell, Santi Karo, almost all of the ones who came to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, they got ordained in Bangkok. And I got the Southern treatment.

**Speaker C:** I see.

**Speaker D:** So anyway, that's part of the status of it. But even with that, that kind of— and those are the kind of things that glued me so tightly into the Sangha that this was my— this became my home. That in fact, that's another reason why they call it a change of lineage. Because we change our lineage from our old birth family. Now our real family becomes the Sangha, with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Anagami Po as my mother and father. Or maybe, uh, Kesa Thero, the preceptor, would be my grandfather, that kind of thing, right? Um, because he was really old. The last time I saw him, by the way, was in 2002, and at date, he was 107 years old. Wow. Not a world's record, not well known, but he was an old man. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Wow. I'm pretty sure he had, um, he maintained his cognitive faculties better than anybody else could, um, because he was so aware probably, and using all of that repetition and connections that we were talking about in our previous talk, remember? Yes. Yeah, he's— he— it doesn't surprise me that he was so well at that point in his life.

**Speaker D:** Yes, that's exactly how it operates, is that bringing that mind, yeah, that wisdom, or bringing that frontal cortex and putting that to use. To make, to bring one in charge of one's life rather than subject to the power of the instinctual. Absolutely. So anyway, the important part about this, this conversation is, is that there are also stages above the waterline. Yeah, that in fact above the waterline you will have at least 7 stages for the Srotapanna. A lot of people in the West, especially on Reddit, and there's a stream-enterers group, the Srotapanna there, and there's one after another who will come in and say, I'm a Srotapanna, or my teacher said I was a Srotapanna, right? Uh, that kind of stuff. So when students ask those kind of questions, uh, or tell me that their teacher has said that they were Srotapanna and all, all of that, The basic thing to do is to start asking them questions, because generally the Westerners are not deep enough into Buddhism to know that there are absolute stages that a person passes through in the Noble Path, that this staircase that we were talking about is actually very, very well laid out and understood. And for some people, you could say that the way that it seems to be taught— you've heard this probably before— and that is the sequence of the words Shiva, Samatha, Panna. Yeah, I think Shiva, Samatha, Panna. The Shiva actually then is behavior, and that that's based upon a set of rules, rites, rituals, that when you become a monk that you've got to behave like a monk, you've got to operate like a monk. Well, actually, the behavior and the operations of the monk is to get the young man to start acting nobly, because if he has— if he's required to act nobly, then that means that he has to think about acting nobly, and he puts him in the right thought or right frame of mind. But we can expand that to the point of saying that this Sila that we're talking about does not have to last for years and years, that all we need to do is to get the mind right now secluded from all unwholesome behaviors, which means that's the seclusion part, that the reason that people go and sit down in a meditation hall is so while they're sitting down in the meditation hall, they at least are not stealing donuts out of the kitchen.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, but I hear you. It's easy to get lost in that behavioral preparation, right? People would often take a self-care day and they would think of going to a spa, and driving the way to the drive, you know, to the spa is often going to be really stressful, so that by the time they reach the spa and their self-care day has already been spent half and they're stressed and none of their goals have been met.

**Speaker D:** So exactly, and you think that it's stressful going to a spa? Thinking about stressful it is for some people to sign up and, and go to a meditation retreat. People are really stressed out. I mean, Debbie, you know who I'm talking about here. Do I? Yeah, that Danny was really stressed out when he went into that retreat. He was so stressed out that I thought twice about it, and then I said, well, let's let him go. But I was actually on the verge of pulling him off of that, uh, that bus.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Say, Daddy, you're not ready for the retreat. You don't have the right attitude. You're still in England. You need to chill, baby, before you have the right attitude to go to that retreat. Yeah. So yes, that's the whole thing. And that's the problem with these retreats, is that people People go into these retreats uptight and not ready to go. They don't think about the retreat as, "Hey, I've got 10 days with nothing to do and no place to go, and I can just hang out and chill and just enjoy myself." But no one goes there with that attitude. Everybody goes with the attitude of, "Things are strange, I don't know what to do, will I fit in, can I do the right thing, am I up to the task?" Or the other side of it is, is that, oh, I'm going to do a lot of work here, I'm really going to get my mind straightened out. And so everybody goes to the retreat generally with the wrong attitude, and then at the end of the retreat when they come out of it, they don't have a continuing support, right? Because they paid for the retreat, they, they, they have nothing as a preparation. They come into the retreat, they do the retreat, they've got problems in the retreat. The retreat didn't work out the way that it should have worked out, and now they leave the retreat after it's fully paid for. And what have they got? They got nothing. Maybe sign up for another retreat. Now that's different than the way that it would be in the, in the Sangha, where the young man just wanders into the temple and makes friends and sits down, and they start teaching about some meditation, and he starts to hang out at the temple more more and more, and then he's been 10 and 20 days in the temple and whatnot like that, and he decides to go home. But then he can come back anytime that he wants to because it's all family now. And that's why the retreat model is not working. It doesn't live up to the expectations that we need in Western Buddhism, is the retreat model is a failure of a model. We need better models.

**Speaker C:** So I think the keywords here are expectation And again, the right attitude would be experimentation, right? So I'm just transposing this to a workplace scenario. So sometimes we have this idea that when we are going to our workplace, office, or whatever, we need to be perfect. We need to do the task perfectly, and that can produce sort of anxiety and restlessness, worry, and all of those negative biases. Instead, we can choose to just go there as an experience, you know, just, I'm going to go and see how I do this task without that expectation of having to do everything perfectly. If we engage in the task with a learning attitude that, okay, I'm going to learn something out of it, a skill development attitude maybe, then I think it will be helpful to balance out those nervous tendencies with enjoyment, do you think?

**Speaker D:** Exactly, yes, exactly. But the problem then is that by the time the student gets to orientation, they've already got the wrong attitude about it. How can we set up the retreat so that the people start to retreat with the right attitude? Attitude about it. That's part of the problem that I see with the retreats, as well as the follow-up. But anyway, let's not spend the rest of our time trashing Western retreats as opposed to the Asian model of just moving into the wat. You originally had a question that was associated with your job, and there was a particular word that you used.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, assertiveness. Assertiveness.

**Speaker B:** Before, I think, I don't know if I missed it or whatever, but you were talking about Srotapannas and then you started talking about Sila and then we ended up here.

**Speaker D:** Oh, you want me to go back and touch on the 7 aspects of what it becomes, needs to become the Sotapanna? Yeah, because I can I can touch on them right quickly. The first point is the first step of the path. The first step of the path that is a noble step actually is quite a high bar, but it's only the first step of Srotapanna. And the first step on the path is when the student is far enough within his meditation and skilled enough up and practicing correctly so that he knows over and over and over again that no matter what his mind is doing, no matter how clouded, or no matter the situation that's forcing him into that clouded mind— like being arrested. When people are getting arrested by the cops, they generally are not their sharpest, right? Okay, when we're sick, we're generally not at our sharpest. So, this actually takes some training, so that we know that no matter what situation we get ourselves into, that we in fact can have that sharp mind, we can pay attention to what's going on, we can live in reality, and we're not going to have obstructions. The obstructions of fear, of doubt, of wanting something, of not liking the fact that you're getting arrested. Interested in that kind of stuff, it's all what we call hindrances. So the first step of the Sotapanna is when the student has the self-confidence, the shraddha, or the right attitude. And that attitude is, no matter what happens, I can handle that situation. I'm the boss here. I'm the king. I can do anything because I'm in charge of my own mind. Okay, so that's the first step of the Sotapanna, is the one who has the self-confidence that he can get himself out of Anagami mess that he gets himself into. That's a pretty high standard, isn't it? Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And

**Speaker D:** it all has to do with one's own internal attitude about things. And that the Buddha then says that this attitude, that I know that I can get my mind cleaned out no matter what, he says that this is noble, it is a step on the path It is supermundane, and by far and above all others, it is not held by ordinary people. Most people do not have that kind of confidence. Very, very few, and often they have the confidence built upon the success of getting away with it. So often this attitude is more of a wrong view And the right view is all ordinary, right view is always filled with doubt. But this noble budding attitude is no, I can't handle anything, even though I don't have the skills to do it. At least I can handle it mentally. Right.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so question.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** In order to handle something that you got yourself into, any mess that you got yourself into. I found this way of thinking that I am the creator of this whole thing, what that happened to me, is powerful. Is that the correct attitude, or am

**Speaker D:** I like— That's exactly right. And we can use ordinary religious language that sounds magical, where in fact is pointing at direct reality. When we say things like you were created and placed on this earth to be a creator, to be a carpenter, to be a designer and manipulator of your own heaven here on earth— that's your job, that's why you were put here is to figure out for yourself how to create heaven on earth.

**Speaker C:** That's

**Speaker D:** the attitude of a Srotapanna. Now it sounds magical in this way of speaking, but that's it, is to recognize that, hey, you're here to create your own universe, you're here to create your own heaven. It has not to be given to you, it's to be made, it's to be manufactured, and you've got all the skills you need to do it.

**Speaker A:** No pressure. Yeah, right.

**Speaker D:** And in fact, the pressure is what we put on ourselves when we think we can't do it. But when you have the attitude, I can do this, there's no pressure. Or if you do put pressure on yourself, you say, I can handle that pressure. After all, I put it on there, I can take it back off, I can tweak it back and forth, I can check how much pressure I can put on myself and handle it.

**Speaker B:** Or

**Speaker C:** if you have an expectation of how that heaven should look like. Should.

**Speaker D:** Okay, now this is only the first step of the Sotapanna, is that self-confidence that I've got this wired, that no matter how obstructed my mind gets, it doesn't matter how bad I get myself into a mess, I can get myself out of that mess mentally right now. Okay, and we can use all kinds of examples of that because we've got all kinds of situations we can get ourselves into. An example of that is the mother-in-law is yelling at us. Okay, I can handle that. I can give her what she wants. Yeah. Okay, how about the judge is pounding his gavel and saying you're guilty? Okay, well, I can handle that. Yeah, I probably did it. My job was to make good friends with this, um, uh, judge, and I wasn't very successful at it, so of course he's going to find me guilty. Going to be finding me guilty of being unfriendly, never mind what happened months ago that the cops drug me in here. In fact, the cops drug me in here because I didn't handle the cops very well, right?

**Speaker C:** So again, it's recognizing those learning opportunities, right? Precisely.

**Speaker D:** That is in fact step 4. Let's jump to step 4. Before, let's visit step 3 a little bit and step 2 has to do with how strong your Samadhi is so that you can see exactly what it is, because what we're really looking for is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And when we come to the point of beyond a shadow of a doubt, we know that that's the only job that we've got to do, which is back to that creator. The only job we've got to do is to make a heaven out of this hell that we find ourselves in. That's That's the only job that we've got to do. Okay, then comes step 4. Sorry,

**Speaker C:** I'm just going to ask one quick question. So would you say step 2 is like an antidote to doubt?

**Speaker D:** Actually, step number 3 actually labels it that way, and that one of the ways that you can say that is knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path. Now, when we say the word path here, we're actually talking about knowledge and vision of what your life is and what it is not, right? Or knowledge and vision of how to live this moment and how not to do it. Because how not to do it would be all of the ways that we have been taught to do it, all the lies we've been told, all the rules that we have all of the supposed-tos, all the pressures, all of the— that sort of stuff is not the path. And that we know that beyond a shadow of a doubt. Yeah, because then we can start practicing what is the path, which is this step 4 that you were asking about. And that step 4 is then being willing to see our faults, to be willing to to make mistakes and to enjoy them as learning experiences. And yet we are taught in our society to hide from our failures, to hide from mistakes. When the child gets out on a 10-point quiz, he gets 8 out of 10, the 2 that he missed becomes the big issue, not the 8 that he got. And so we go around looking at losses, we look at mistakes, and we say that they're bad and whatnot, rather than seeing them as learning opportunities. But here now, we've got a complete change of mind. And that complete change of mind is that, "Oh, mistakes? Yeah, let's make a few." How are we going to figure out how to do it? An example that I use is Edison, with his statement about making an incandescent lamp. And by the way, there was a lot of competition; they knew electricity. And they knew they could sell a bunch of it to make a huge amount of money if they could only figure out a way of using it. Yeah, and electric lights was the big item, the big-ticket item. And so out of that competition to get the light bulb going, Edison said that he had 1% inspiration and that 99% perspiration. This is exactly what we're talking about here. When we see our failures as perspiration, that means we see them as failures, right? But if we look at it in the sense that we've got 100 things that we got to try out here, we've got one of them, let's get the next one and the next one and the next one, and finally we get through the list and we'll figure out how to do this. In fact, they found out that it was a tungsten-filled filament in an argon gas. Because argon, by the way, is a noble gas. It does not mess around when things get hot. And that's what's able to keep that light burning, is because that tungsten filament could, could stretch. That's why it was tungsten, is because with the heat it goes back and forth, but it never collapses or burns out or anything like that, because it's never oxygenated, because the gas that it's in is noble. So that's a very interesting story about that, because we can begin to live our lives that way by recognizing that, oh, if we're going to have a light go on, we're going to have to try a lot of stuff. Let's use that as a learning experience rather than as a series of failures, even to the point of absolute wrongdoing. So in the suttas, the Buddha talks about actually for the student to go to his teacher for confession with the understanding that he's going to learn from that, pay the retribution, get over it, and learn from that mistake. Right.

**Speaker C:** So we switch from the guilt and shame perspective of dealing with mistakes to a learning perspective. And that is likely to increase one's learning ability because you're not paralyzed with guilt or shame.

**Speaker D:** So now we come back full circle about that. Exactly right, because we are willing to look, because we're not afraid of what we're going to see, because we don't see things as failures anymore. We see everything as a success, which is the right attitude. I can handle this. You see how all of this stuff begins to work together? Well, with that attitude also, the attitude comes with hot diggity dog, this Dhamma stuff is good stuff. I might start living my whole life like this. So that's when the really enthusiastic part of the thing starts kicking in, is step 5 and 6, is when we become really dedicated to the Dhamma. There's really nothing much else to do. And then step 7, on top of that, then is what they would call the— the word that's used in the Pali is actually the word Nandi. But Nandi or Nanda has a different kind of quality in India. You know what I'm talking about.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's a cow.

**Speaker D:** Nanda is also used for carnal lust and things like that. Well, the same thing is true with the word Rato, Arhatana. Okay, so the sutta winds up then talking about that step 7 of the Srotapanna is one who is absolutely delighted with the Dharma, that that's the only thing he really cares about, that he's absolutely into it, that it's his delight, that he finds delight therein. And we're always looking for delight, and you can always find the delight in the Dharma. That in fact, another way of looking at it is by recognizing that the Dhamma, when we're talking about it and speaking about it, this way. It's really good stuff. It is actually wholesome. And because— by

**Speaker C:** that stage, I think the dopamine connections are so strong that you're practically seeking enjoyment out of making mistakes, learning and exploring more and more. So it's just— yeah, yeah, you got it right.

**Speaker D:** So we learn to control the dopamine in our own mind, but we do it naturally.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, can you, can you be delighted with the Dharma while being a layman? Is what— can you reach that? Can you take that seventh step to be delighted with the Dharma without being in the robes? Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker D:** Now let me say it this way. How many different ways are there to be able to drive a car? At some point in everybody's life, in the beginning we're completely afraid and all of that, but there will come a time when you're driving the car when you're absolutely delighted with the fact that you've got freedom now. Yeah, yeah, even when driving a car there is an absolute delight with this thing. Wow, I can drive, you know. Okay, well, that's the stage of the Sotapanna, is the one who is ready to go jump in the car at any possible moment.

**Speaker C:** All right, and that pleasure is, I think, different from these immediate gratifications of, you know, watching Netflix or something like that, because it sounds like a Metta-level happiness or pleasure or dopamine kick that is attained at this level. You are just delighted by the whole process rather than the goal. Uh-huh.

**Speaker D:** Now I will ask you something that seems a little bit related. Let's talk about olfactory and air and other things like that and ask you also about what is called the bonding chemical or the bonding between an infant and her mother when they they first meet. Okay, is it possible for anything about dopamine in the brain to have any possible effect upon saliva? The answer, of course, is yeah, it's only a couple inches away. Of course dopamine is going to wander into the saliva when you've got a lot of dopamine. Well, isn't tiny droplets of saliva and other things like that how a virus spread? Yeah. Okay, well, isn't it then possible for someone who is full of dopamine to stand on stage and tell jokes and everybody gets a really big kick out of it and goes into a great deal of joy? Yeah. So in a way, dopamine is spread. The question is, can you spread it through the internet, or does it have to be face to face? It

**Speaker C:** can happen both ways.

**Speaker D:** I think so. I think that there's as much a psychological component, but I do remember having the feeling that just being in the company of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was something useful. Yeah, I think— and that the only way that I can put it back, it must have been his out-breathing. It must have been something that was in the air around him that he was putting out. Because there was something about it, but it was not magical. It seems magical because we've got no way to understand it or measure it or anything like that. But these are the kind of things that are, that are possible, that when one person has a lot of dopamine, he can spread it to another person. This is exactly what we're talking about with teaching the Dhamma. That people, when they are listening to the Dhamma and absorbing the Dhamma, they're having almost completely wholesome thoughts. When they're asking a lot of questions, that's not necessarily the case, but when the students are really listening to the teacher teach the Dhamma, then they get it, and they get it in a way that now their mind becomes in a complete wholesome state, which means they're on the way to first Jhana just by listening and paying attention. When the dopamine is out there also, that means that they begin to pick up on that on the psychological level. They begin to gladden and having happy thoughts. And so you can actually talk someone into first Jhana, and you don't have to call that hypnosis. Yeah, but, but first Jhana is actually possible through the teaching. In fact, at least two of you are in the first Jhana right this very minute. Because you could tell, I mean, it's like, yeah, this is really good, feels nice. Okay, so this is, this is something. It took me a while to get

**Speaker A:** here in the first.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's delightful, it really is. So when you get that delight, that delight is part of the first Jhana, is that everything is just so delightful, everything is so marvelous. All right, so the first jhana, in fact, and the Srotapanna are interrelated deeply. That in fact, the Srotapanna is one who is of the full fruit of Srotapanna, is one who is practicing first jhana quite a lot. And if he's lucky, he can catch it when he's not, right?

**Speaker A:** What is, what is quite a lot? What do you mean, like daily basis? We're talking about several times a day.

**Speaker D:** Well, when the mind wanders away, how long does it wander before you see, aha, there you go?

**Speaker A:** I see it immediately, only it almost— I feel like, oh, I can feel that slipping away, and sometimes it's hard to come back, to get myself out of it. But I feel like this connection is faster now.

**Speaker D:** But that becomes the Here's that point, referring back to the Eightfold Noble Path that we've talked about so much, and this is the issue of right effort. What is one's right effort? The answer to that is that one's right effort is a skill to be developed, so that when we first start practicing, it's a lot of effort, because we're not skilled at it. An example of that would be like carrying a heavy load, that when you first, as a child, you pick up something heavy, like Daddy says, "Hand me that wrench," or, "Hand me that hammer," and the child picks up that hammer and it's really heavy for that child, you know, maybe both hands to pick it up and hold it, or maybe a coffee cup like that for a young child is heavy. But for Daddy, he grabs that hammer and he's throwing it around, okay? So this is the point about one's right effort, but the effort comes not just with muscle strength, it also comes with Dad's attitude, because he knows he's handled the hammer many times before and he's expert at it. And so his attitude makes the handling of a hammer easy. This is when a right effort becomes skillful, it becomes almost energetic, so that the child who had to trouble handing Daddy the hammer. Once Daddy's got the hammer, he can go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, like that. And he's expert at it. He knows exactly what he's doing. Okay, question.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Um, uh, I almost have this feeling I always want to try myself how long I can stay in that, that, uh, that bad state. I would say like there's almost like a, a dare in this.

**Speaker D:** Okay, now here's the thing. When you start to come out of it, Arahant, how long you can keep it going? When you start to come out of it, can you congratulate yourself for how long you were in, or do you fuss at yourself for coming out?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm like, okay, it feels much better now. And then I go back and I'm like, how long can I take this? And then I can like— this is so bizarre. You

**Speaker C:** remind me of that. Go

**Speaker D:** ahead, Debbie.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you remind me of a conflict I had. So I was trying to watch my mind wander from wholesome thoughts, right? And during the meditation, I was like, initially I was like, okay, my mind is going away and bringing it back. And then I got confused because I was like, am I watching my mind wander off? Like, when I'm watching my mind, am I not also doing something? Am I triggering wandering my mind by watching it? I was like, whoa, what's going on?

**Speaker B:** And

**Speaker D:** here's the wake-up with that is, look at all the confusion I'm manufacturing right now when I could just be relaxed instead. I don't have to figure it out. That's the whole quality that we're looking at, is you don't have to figure it all out. You all need— all the knowledge you need is enough knowledge to really enjoy the moment. Okay, so in fact, what we can point at here is that in this system that we've been talking about, I've actually covered covered 3 of the fetters. I know what I'm doing here, okay? But in the Buddhist cosmology or anything, there are actually 10 fetters, or 10 asavas, or 10 kalasas. There are 2 different words for it. They seem different. One word is kalasa, and the kalasas actually can be seen as a rope or a fetter or a bondage or or let us say even a birthday present that's tied up with a bow. The tying up with a bow, that's it, okay? That's the fetter. We tie things up with bows. Now the other word is asava, and the word asava has much more to do with an outflow like a wart or a pimple or an obstruction on the skin. You could think of it as a pox, a blackhead, a pimple, an outflow. These are things. And then in fact, in that analogy, that's an actually a good one, because when people have a bunch of blackheads or pimples on their face and they go to a dermatologist, does the dermatologist say, okay, they're gone? No. One at a time, either with a needle or with his fingers, or maybe a little thing like this, he's just popping one at time, one at a time, one at a time. In this mind moment, one more asava, one unwholesome thought. Just one more. Got that one too. Oh, isn't that a beauty? Wow, that was a big one. Got white stuff and a little blood on it. Yeah, we can buff that. Okay, and one more. And so we can take these asavas as that. And the— by the way, the last one on the list is ignorance again, the Anagami. It seems like we start with ignorance, we have it in the Second Noble Truth, we have it as the foundation of Piti, Samuppada, and what do we wind up with at the very end of the tale? It's still ignorance again, but this time it's got a different influence on it. This time is, in fact, this is where we find out what the middle path is all about, Too much ignorance leads into Dukkha, but there's always an end to it because you cannot know everything. You just can't know everything. In fact, uh, in— here's something that I just saw in the news, just as an example. They have— they started the survey because they began to notice the stars were disappearing. Now they go back and they've done their research in the past 100 years or so of astronomy, 700 stars in the Milky Way have just disappeared. They're gone. And that's not even part of our cosmology. We didn't expect our stars to just disappear, and yet they have. But we don't know why yet. Okay, this is just another level of ignorance. There will be no end to human knowledge, just no end to it. But we as children in our schools are taught that if you don't know, you're in trouble. You've got to answer the questions. And so we get into making stuff up rather than learning to be at awe with what we don't know. I have to say amazing all the changes that have happened in psychology. And I really haven't studied psychology in 50 years, but when I did, I had it down solid. I got a really good foundation. But look at what's happened since then. They're getting actually Buddhist.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I can't help— I have to point this out. So it seems like, um, toward the lower, um, rungs of the stair, it's like encouraging people towards more deliberation, right? And then anybody

**Speaker B:** else lost Debbie skills to be?

**Speaker D:** Yes, I saw you, Debbie, and Anya and Marcel all faded out. And now I still see, now I see David. Debbie's back. Now I see everyone.

**Speaker A:** I see everyone.

**Speaker D:** Marcel, are you moving yet? Yes, I see him moving. Not much, but he's moving. Okay, so we're back. Debbie, the floor is yours.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so like I said, it seems like towards the lower rung of the stairs, it's an encouragement towards more deliberation, towards more conscious choice-based behavior. But when we come full circle to ignorance, it's also pointing out that we cannot control everything. So if we zoom out, it's more like a balance. We learn, develop a skill, but then we learn to accept the fact that that particular skill is not always going to be effective. Do you think that's Exactly so.

**Speaker D:** So what we need now is to learn the definition and how to apply the word enough.

**Speaker C:** Ah, right. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Now, when is enough enough? Okay, that's the way that we look at it. In some cases, some things are just not ever enough, like the next breath. I'll take another one, thank you, and another. But eventually, even that will be all this next breath this is just going to be too much work, right? That's exactly how people died on crosses, and that's exactly how people die in a hospital bed from morphine, is this next breath is just too much work, too much effort. So I think I'll forget this one. I'll give this one a miss, even if it kills me.

**Speaker A:** All these jokes about death. Okay,

**Speaker D:** so in that regard, we can recognize that actually there's a story about how important this is, because as I told you before, part of Achan Po's training method with me, partly because of lack of English on his part and lack of Thai on my part, but he would set me up. The kind of ways that they would set me up were different than the ways that you hear about in Japan, but in the in the Zen tradition, the teachers often set up the student by slamming the door in his face at particular times and other things like this. Okay, so Bhikkhu Achanpo did this with me, and one of the things that he would do would— he'd come and stand outside my kuti, and I don't know how long he'd stand out there, but he'd stand until I got the load of the fact that he was there, which meant that I had to start waking up and start looking because I didn't want my teacher to stand out for an hour while I pedaling around and not paying any attention. He was quite capable of standing there for an hour just to see how long it'd take for me to wake up. So this is one of the things. And another one, just so much— I mean, I'm so fond of him, I've got so much to say. But another one was that he would sneak up on me out of the blue and walk past me with a word. Sometimes that word would be Tathagata, which is the Pali word for be here now. Wakey wakey! I just got— I just walked up to you. You— I was behind you. I walked up to you and whispered in your ear, and you didn't even know I was here. Wakey wakey! And so I do that with my family. Yeah, I do that with my 8-year-old daughter. I'll sneak up on her on a regular basis. Why? Because I learned that from my teacher. But another one that he would do when he would sneak up would be he would just come and just say, not sure, and just walk right off. Not sure. Okay, to teach that point of this is an investigation, don't come to a conclusion, don't rely upon knowledge, rely upon investigation. Keep looking. Assume that you don't know. Assume that you're not sure and that it's worthy of an investigation, which is completely different than doubt, because doubt is when we don't know and we're afraid to look. Yeah, we're afraid of the answer. We don't want to know. Then here's a good example of that. In a horror movie— this happens in every horror movie— they're playing really weird music and someone like a young lady or girl, maybe a teenage girl, is walking down a hall that is dark and they're playing this kind of music and everybody in the audience is saying, don't go down that hall, don't go down that hall, don't go look to see what's going on. You know, that's the feeling that we have. Don't look, stay afraid, don't— and you know, it's dangerous down there, don't look. And often in those things, when she does go through that door at the end of the hall, there's nothing there. It's a letdown. It's part of the buildup of the scene. And so this is not the dangerous moment, but the moviemakers, they know how to control people's feelings like this. Okay, so this is that point. This is an amazing aspect of doubt, is because we do not do an investigation, because if we did, that would dispel the doubt. That's why we want to actually, in our practice, to change our doubt into curiosity. Why? Because curiosity is willing to look. Doubt doesn't want to. Doubt's got fear in it.

**Speaker C:** And that highlights that okayness that you were talking about, that supreme okayness, because doubt has that quality of you're not going to be safe, you're not okay. But curiosity is like, I'm okay and I can take the risk of looking. Right, exactly, exactly.

**Speaker D:** Back to Eric Byrne. I'm okay here. Yeah, yeah, that okay corral that he invented is just so powerful in this regard. Are we going to be okay enough to treat everybody else as if they're okay too, even when they don't think so? Is everybody going to be friends here, or am I going to go around saying I'm okay but you're not okay? But most of the time, people go around the other side and say, well, I'm not okay, will you please help me? Maybe you're okay. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Or

**Speaker D:** the worst of it is the criminal who says, well, I'm not okay, but neither are you. Bang bang. And so, yeah, that treating each other as okay because we can feel okay, on top of the world, we're the winner here, we've got this wired, we can handle this, which means that we can bring this conversation, if you will, back to the original definition of that word that you were using, assertive, right? Is that the word? [Speaker:RICK] Yeah. The word assertive, by the way, has somewhere built into it the word sure. That when we're assertive, asserting something, that's because we're sure of it. Okay, the question is, is that if we are assertive, how are we going to be received? Sometimes we can be assertive and received well, and sometimes we're assertive and we get attacked. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Right, and that's the trick. There lies the, you know, the okayness. We have to be okay to let people be defensive about their own issues. So it doesn't matter if I am assertive or not. If I'm not received well, that should be okay. Do you think?

**Speaker D:** Yes, and because it's okay, we can use that as a learning experience so that we can continue to try things. But if it's not okay that we fail because we're too assertive, we go around saying, "Oh, I was so assertive and I screwed up, oh poor me!" Okay, that's the way that we expect it to happen, is that when you're too assertive and you fail because of whatever reason, that the answer to that is, "Okay, we're in charge of this machine, we can tweak it, we figured that out." We can actually see people as they're in the process of turning around. I mean, you know how fast psychology works and that things don't happen. Everything blows up at once. I mean, even a bomb doesn't just go off all at once. Somebody had to go put that, plant that bomb, set the timer, go find the explosive, get the battery, and put that thing together. And we do that kind of stuff. So even if somebody explodes over you being assertive, it didn't happen all at once. He was already a ticking bomb. So we need to see that too. So we have to plan on when we're going to be assertive and under what conditions and whatnot. And one of them is to make sure that our assertions is not because we feel threatened, that the real assertiveness is when we are absolutely sure because we keep investigating. In fact, that's one of the reasons One of the reasons why we want to listen to our people that we're being assertive with is because they may have some new information. But if we're so bent on getting our way, then we're going to perhaps screw that up. And so staying in the flow and listening things, because as you can tell, I often will refer back to students of things that they've said. Earlier in the conversation. Yeah, I always will use where the students have started as a point to, you know, sort of like I learned this by watching Sea Hunt. Let's not get into it, but under the ocean, if you're looking for something, the thing that you want to do is point a stake in the ground and then circle around it and make a bigger and wider circle, but you always leave that stake in the ground.

**Speaker C:** Right, so like a reference point.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker D:** And so in this conversation, it's always been about assertiveness. And so we've now come around full circle back to that word, though we've been dancing around it by going off onto Srotapanna and going off onto all kinds of places. But it really has to do back with this issue of, are we going to be alert and awake enough so that we can handle situation wisely, handily, where I'm okay and he's okay. I do not have to be assertive because I feel not okay, that he's winning, and so I've got to jump in and try to win the case. Oh no, if I'm feeling like I'm losing the situation, the trick that I use— and I've done this several times, it works really well— and that is, well, I need a pee break right now No, I need to get rid of something here.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I was just about to ask you. Don't worry. Right, and then you take a break from being threatened and feeling all those emotional turbulence within you. Yeah, completely.

**Speaker D:** And then get yourself back together and then come back into that meeting and let them have it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, I have a question. What would be the best What, like, I know the excuse of going to the bathroom, but you really, like, there's a conflict happening, say, within a small space. How do you correctly leave? Because last time I did it, it was not pretty. I just, it was actually, I was like, oh, I thought I was good enough, but no. So I was so, so angry and I just slammed the door and walked out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but you came back too soon, I guess, is what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, actually I did, I did fine. I walked around and it was fabulous that I left. But how do you leave correctly? Like, how— not correctly, I'm saying, how do you leave without making it even worse? Or like making— I don't know.

**Speaker D:** How do you know it was made worse? Because there's your doubt.

**Speaker A:** I didn't speak to my aunt for like the whole day after.

**Speaker C:** Well,

**Speaker D:** did she cool off in a day? If you had stayed and argued with her for another 10 minutes, would she have cooled off in one day, or would it have taken a week? These are the things we don't know. So you're trying to outguess the road not taken, rather than recognizing that when you are in a tense situation, the best thing to do— and in fact, that there are so many places in the suttas where this is the recommendation— when it is hot, get out of the kitchen. When you are holding a hot rock, withdraw your hand from it. Yeah, yeah. When, when you are in an argument with someone do anything you can to get out of it, even if it looks like a small social faux pas, to get out of the conversation. That's probably going to be much better than staying in and making a big social faux pas.

**Speaker A:** So, so wait, so I was— I'm actually judging myself on how I walked out right now? Like, I'm actually giving myself— I just

**Speaker D:** got to congratulate yourself for walking out. Well,

**Speaker C:** and if you want to, if you want to do it more skillfully, then something that I do is I call out whatever I'm feeling. I say, I don't know why this argument or this discussion is bothering me a little bit, so I'm going to take some time off. Can we catch up later? That's a very neutral thing. And you're telling the other person— just

**Speaker D:** get away with that. You need to be a little bit more polite in normal society. Psychologists can get away with being that blunt. Because basically what you just said is, you just tick me off and I gotta get some space or I'm gonna clobber you. The

**Speaker C:** person opposite is not going to feel threatened. So instead, if you say, you're pissing me off, they're going to immediately be defensive, right? So I find it useful to say, I am bothered by it, so I'm gonna cool off. Mm-hmm, right.

**Speaker D:** And what— and the words that can come out are something innocuous, something that's intermediate, something that's obvious. Like, one of the ways of doing it, by the way, in a very simple way, is, would you like to get a coffee? Here, let me buy you a coffee. And then we can distract them, and while we're walking to the coffee machine or whatever, we can change the subject. That's one of the ways to do it, is to get a diversion. If you're in a hot conversation with somebody, change it, change it as soon as you recognize. Because this is exactly meditation, isn't it? That when you see that something unwholesome is happening in the mind, you put something wholesome in the mind, okay? And if you need to take a hike to do that, then go take a hike. I've got to go to the bathroom right now. I've been, you know, this is kind conversation's been so interesting, I really want to do it, but I got to go, I got to go, and then you're gone. And so you're not blaming him for how bad you feel or anything like that. You're— it's a call of nature, by the way, they call it. Yeah. And so that's, that's why a potty break is often a really excellent way out. Out of a tense situation.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's good advice, Dhammarato. I'll keep that in mind.

**Speaker D:** Another one would be— and this would be a silly one, and maybe people would even see through this one— and there's, oh, I've got to go feed the parking meter. Yeah, that's another one that can be used. Oh, I got to go put some money in the parking meter, or whatever like that. But anything that's not to do with the conversation that we're in, let's get out of it by blaming something else on the outside, because in fact you're doing yourself and the other person a great favor by doing this. Remember that this, the teaching of the Buddha, is not about honesty, honesty, honesty, honesty, honesty. No, this is about Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Let's get out of this Dukkha, even if we have to tell a little white lie to do it. Let's get out. And we want to tell a little white lie because the truth is going to pick this person off. We want to give him more Dukkha with the truth. You know that much about him. Okay, so this is where friendship and wisdom override these harsh rules about thou shalt not tell a lie. But sometimes a small lie is a very noble thing to do. It takes some wisdom though. We have to look at what we're doing, but getting out of an argument— anything to get you out of an argument is the right way to go. Yeah. So, feed the talking meter. Gotta go feed the dog. Gotta go for the potty break. Oh, the mailman just arrived. Here, let me go take care of the mail. Anything. It doesn't matter what it is, but if you're in a tense situation and you have bad feelings about it, then allow yourself to have a break so that you can get away for 3 or 4 minutes, take a deep breath, reassure yourself of that first step of the Sotapanna. I can handle this. I know I can handle this. I got tense, that's why I got out of it. Now I'm not tense, I'm ready to go. Yeah, you

**Speaker A:** know what my grandma used to do when there was an argument? She was like, oh, my heart.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking that.

**Speaker D:** That's a good one, right? Old people can do that. That, in fact, 100 years ago, women would use swooning to change the topic. Yeah, they'd say, oh, that's too much for me. And now the whole topic has changed because now everybody's taking care of them. Yeah, so these diversions to get away from it rather than feeling that we have to protect ourselves. So that's That's one whole area of assertion that we can by-step or get past by getting out of the situation rather than feeling like we've got to stand there and defend ourselves. Because that's where most assertions are, is trying to defend ourselves because we're feeling like we're under attack. But if you're really sure that it's actually the truth, it's not me they're attacking, it's the truth that they're attacking. Attacking. Now we can friendly find a way of speaking of the situation in a friendly way. That's after the potty break. Be sure the potty break works because you can't have 3 or 4 potty breaks in a row. This

**Speaker B:** happened to me actually. I was out on the street doing some activism and you know, normally people don't like what you have to say when it's the truth. And one guy came up and he got a bit, you know, angry. And I was just like, okay, I can't, like, I can't handle this. So I was like, oh, that's a really good question. Let me, you know, hey, hey, you know, it's like my friend Adam is like, hey Adam, do you know how to answer this question? That's

**Speaker D:** it. That's right.

**Speaker B:** And then what happened— but this is the great thing, right? This is the great thing. So I was like, okay, cool, I can't handle this. I'll let, you know, I'll let someone more experienced handle this. Um, because I tried, I was like, well, you know, this isn't working. So, hey Adam, my friend here has a really good question. And so I just went over to talk to someone else, and then the guy followed me. He's like, you're not getting away from me, you can't pass me off to your friend.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** At the end of all of it, I. I turned to my friend and he. I told him, like, and this is. This is my friend. He's quite wise, clearly, because I said,

**Speaker D:** oh, man, that guy was really angry at me. And he was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't take it personally. The guy was angry. You just happened to be around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. He was not angry at you anyway, that you bought that.

**Speaker D:** That was your. That was your trip. Anger coming by here, let me stand

**Speaker C:** in the way and catch it. Uh, yeah, I laugh about it now.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I laughed about it just as soon as he said that. I started laughing about it, and then it was like, that's right, that's the wake-up.

**Speaker C:** I mean, that's brilliant. That's, that's really great.

**Speaker D:** I'm glad that you were able to hear, because many people he could have

**Speaker B:** said that to, and they says, oh

**Speaker D:** no, he was angry at me. Me. I don't know, he was definitely— it was definitely not about me. It was definitely about like you. It was obviously about you, right? Yeah, he doesn't even know you enough to be angry at you, right? Yeah, and if I could make someone that angry in 2 minutes, that's all he needed to know. I said that's all they need to know, you were on the wrong team.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** That he was— so we can say

**Speaker B:** that he was threatened by not getting

**Speaker D:** an answer, and that may have triggered his anger, right? Oh no, it wasn't so much that he wasn't getting an answer as well as he was making a statement and I was asking follow-up questions and he

**Speaker A:** didn't have the answer.

**Speaker D:** I see, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so he was very sure and assertive.

**Speaker D:** You want to be the wise guy, you got to make sure that— exactly, that happens a lot. Lot, by the way. That's the method. Yeah. And you know what eventually happened to Socrates, don't you? Oh yeah, he asked too many of the right questions to too many people.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker D:** But he did some good along the way, right? Oh yeah, that's a risk I'm willing to take. He more or less prevented a war. Yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah, basically what his whole point was that, um, he was trying to teach the youth of Athens that they could go have happy lives without joining the army. Poor politics. But the old guard were angry at the Spartans, and the old guard in Athens were trying to raise an army so they that they could go whoop Athens. And Socrates was going around town telling all the youth, "Don't join the army. Don't do it. It's dangerous. You'll wind up as a war victim. You'll wind up maimed. The government's not going to take care of you after you're out of the army. Don't join the army." That was Socrates' number one position, that he did it by asking all of the students all the right questions. Questions, like, "What's going to happen to you after you're out of the army? Will you make it out of the army?" And people start to think about what's going on, and they stop joining the army, because he was asking all the right questions. And then he wouldn't stop asking the right questions. Actually, there was a way out for him. He could have gone into exile, he

**Speaker B:** could have left Athens, or he could

**Speaker D:** have shot up, and he wasn't about to do either one.

**Speaker B:** He had the chance to escape as well. He didn't try to escape. That's why he had the chance to— his friends, like, literally were able to get him, like, into, I think, where

**Speaker D:** they were— he was being held. He's like, come on, let's go. He's like, nah. Even the— even the guard was, uh, that kept him in the prison was kind of in on it. The guard himself would, uh, the prisoner— I mean, he was a prisoner in the jail, and the jailers were willing to let him go. I mean, everybody was willing to let him go, even the aristocracy that had put him in jail, they were willing to let him go, because they knew that he hadn't done anything. He had just ticked them off. Oh, Debbie, you're back, great! I

**Speaker C:** know we weren't being assertive, but I had to take a toilet break still.

**Speaker D:** So I know I was, I was going to make a joke, but you beat me to it. Anyway, guys, this has been really a delightful conversation. I really enjoyed it, but it's about time to wrap up. Does anybody have any parting remarks? Marks. Any, any questions or anything? Marcel has been really glad that, uh, that you've been on call with us today. I hope you've been enjoying it. You haven't said much of anything. Oh,

**Speaker B:** there we go.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. I have some poor connection.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** He's

**Speaker A:** smiling. Well,

**Speaker D:** Drew, do you have any parting remarks?

**Speaker B:** Nah, been fun as usual. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I'm hungry.

**Speaker B:** I gotta go. Nature's call.

**Speaker D:** Anya, I'm glad to see you again today too.

**Speaker A:** Well, me too. I'm very happy to see you all again.

**Speaker B:** How's your move gone, Anna?

**Speaker A:** So I moved back to my hometown for now. After that, actually, well, that wasn't— anyway, I'm trying to— I'm not trying, I'm planning to go back to the United States. And I attempted to buy a ticket online and my credit card did not go go through because I needed a 3, 2, whatever step verification process. That's another, that's another issue. So I'm still at home, but

**Speaker B:** not for long, hopefully.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm planning to do it sometime in October. Best of luck. Yeah, thank you guys. Debbie,

**Speaker D:** did you get your question answered about assertive? We didn't dwell directly with but we certainly have them.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the entire conversation was like you said around it, right? So I got a revision of a lot more stuff, a lot more than I bargained, but it was brilliant. I love how supportive our community is. Like, I love these, you know, how you contribute and give your ideas. It's very enriching. I love it, guys. Yes,

**Speaker D:** the Dhamma is just absolutely marvelous stuff. It's quite a toy to play with. I really love it. Okay guys, well, we'll see you next week, or if you want to, give me a call. Marcel, I'd especially like to hear you privately if you want to. We can talk together. Thank you very much. It's Manuel though. You can call him Marcel if you like. Manuel. Okay, sorry, but my eyes are not all that great. I have to go down and look at it.

**Speaker C:** Emmanuel.

**Speaker D:** Okay, I got that. And Drew, that's a really strange way to spell Drew.

**Speaker B:** It's got a D at the end.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'm glad you told me because I would have Dhammarato, you're

**Speaker A:** talking about other people's names? Look at yours.

**Speaker D:** This is not my name. Well, it doesn't belong to me. It was a gift. Yeah,

**Speaker C:** using that deep personal relationship.

**Speaker D:** I mean, it's a prized possession, but it's not mine. I

**Speaker C:** don't even know what your actual name is, Dhammarato. Nobody does.

**Speaker D:** I mean, that's so old. It's a secret change of lineage already. So Dhammarato is all we need. Okay, at one time it was a wish fulfillment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, call me Bond, James Bond. Call

**Speaker D:** me Rat, Dhamma Rat.

**Speaker A:** Oh my God, thank you. It was great to see you.

**Speaker D:** Okay guys, see you.

**Speaker C:** Bye bye everyone.

**Speaker D:** Bye Drew. Bye bye Manuel. See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, covers a wide range of topics, weaving personal experiences with core Buddhist teachings. Here is a structured summary of the key themes and progression:

### **Core Themes & Summary**

The conversation flows organically from a personal anecdote into a deep exploration of the path from ordinary to noble (enlightened) understanding, the role of rules and wisdom, and practical advice for daily life.

**1. Meditation in Daily Life: The Airport & Tube Example**
*   A speaker shares how sustained meditation practice transformed a long, boring airport journey into a pleasant experience of simply sitting and breathing.
*   This leads to a reflection on modern distractions (ads, phones) as symptoms of an inability to be with oneself. The practice becomes about maintaining presence even in distracting environments like the London Tube.

**2. The "Staircase" Analogy: Ordinary vs. Noble Beings**
*   Dhammarato introduces a central analogy: the spiritual path is like a staircase, partly submerged.
    *   **Below the water (Ordinary):** This is the realm of conflict between **wrong view** ("I can get away with anything") and **ordinary right view** ("You can't get away with it; we need rules, police, religion, guilt/shame to enforce boundaries").
    *   **Above the water (Noble):** This is the realm of enlightened understanding, beyond the need for external rules and internal conflict.
*   He explains that **everyone internally battles** between these ordinary wrong and right views (linking it to Freudian and Transactional Analysis models of id/child vs. superego/parent).
*   **Key Insight:** Rules (Sila) and rituals are like training wheels or a parent's hand for a learning child—necessary for development but meant to be outgrown as wisdom (Panna) through investigation and direct observation takes over.

**3. Cultural Psychology: Guilt vs. Honor Societies**
*   The discussion contrasts "guilt-based" individualistic Western cultures (where "I'm sorry" means internal self-punishment) with "honor-based" collectivist cultures like Thailand (where apology is communal, seeking reconciliation from the group).
*   This highlights how societies use different psychological tools (fear, guilt, shame, honor) to regulate the behavior of those at the "ordinary" level, all of which are rooted in greed and aversion (the Second Noble Truth).

**4. The Sangha as a Flexible Hospital, Not a Fortress**
*   Dhammarato clarifies that ordination is not a permanent, higher-status commitment. The Sangha is more like a **hospital** or a **training ground**.
*   One can ordain and disrobe multiple times as life circumstances (family, business) require. The emphasis is on the **quality of practice and understanding**, not the robes.
*   However, the Sangha wisely has "admissions criteria" (e.g., debt-free, mother's permission, no pending crimes) to ensure entrants have a foundation of ordinary right view, preventing it from being used as a hiding place.

**5. The Seven Steps of a Stream-Enterer (Sotapanna)**
*   Dhammarato outlines the first noble attainment, emphasizing it's a high bar of internal confidence, not just intellectual understanding:
    1.  **Unshakable Confidence:** The certainty that, no matter the mental or life mess, one can "clean out" the mind and handle it. "I am the creator of my heaven here on earth."
    2.  **Strong Samadhi (Concentration):** The ability to see things clearly.
    3.  **Knowledge & Vision of the Path:** Clearly knowing what is and is *not* the path to end suffering.
    4.  **Embracing Mistakes as Learning:** A complete shift from guilt/shame to seeing faults as valuable learning opportunities (like Edison's experiments).
    5.  **& 6. Intense Dedication to the Dhamma.**
    7.  **Delight in the Dhamma (Nandi):** Finding deep, wholesome joy in the practice itself, not in worldly gains. This is linked to the wholesome pleasure of **First Jhana**.

**6. Practical Wisdom for Daily Conflicts: Assertiveness & "The Potty Break"**
*   In response to a question about assertiveness, the talk offers practical advice for handling conflict:
    *   True assertiveness comes from confidence and investigation, not from feeling threatened.
    *   The primary skill is knowing **when and how to withdraw** from a heated situation to avoid causing more suffering (Dukkha).
    *   The humorous but profound advice is to use any polite excuse to take a break ("I need a bathroom break," "I need to feed the meter"). This is framed as a compassionate act for all parties, aligning with the principle of reducing suffering over rigid honesty.
    *   Upon returning, one can re-engage with a cooler, wiser mind, from a place of "okayness" (referencing Eric Berne's "I'm OK, You're OK").

**7. Synchronicity vs. Magic**
*   Discussing meaningful coincidences, a distinction is made:
    *   **Ordinary/Magical View:** Sees synchronicity as something to be controlled or as proof of personal specialness.
    *   **Noble/Realistic View:** Observes synchronicity with awe as a natural feature of an interconnected world, without claiming ownership or seeking to manipulate it.

### **Conclusion & Overall Message**
The talk beautifully connects the lofty goal of stream-entry with the grit of daily practice. The path is presented as a gradual shift:
*   **From** being ruled by external rules and internal conflict (guilt/shame, fear/greed)...
*   **To** being guided by internal wisdom, investigation, and the confidence that arises from direct experience.
*   **From** seeing meditation as a separate retreat activity...
*   **To** making every moment—on a plane, in an argument, at work—an opportunity for mindful presence and learning.

The ultimate goal is to develop enough skill and **"okayness"** to navigate life's challenges with delight in the Dhamma itself, using practical, compassionate strategies to reduce suffering for oneself and others in real-time.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich and wide-ranging conversation, several core metaphors and stories are used to explain spiritual and psychological concepts. Here are the main ones:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Staircase / Ladder (with a Waterline):**
    *   This is the central organizing metaphor. The spiritual path is a staircase. The part **below the waterline** represents the stages of "ordinary" people, characterized by conflict between wrong view ("I can get away with anything") and ordinary right view ("You can't get away with it; we need rules/boundaries"). The part **above the waterline** represents the "noble" stages of enlightenment (Sotāpanna, etc.), characterized by wisdom, investigation, and freedom from rigid rules.

2. **The Child Learning to Walk (with Mother's Hand):**
    *   Used to explain society's rules and spiritual aids (sīla, rituals). They are like a mother's hand, offering stability and safety as a child (the practitioner) learns. As wisdom grows, one can walk independently, sometimes rejecting the hand (rebellion), sometimes grabbing it again (need for support), until eventually it is no longer needed.

3. **The Hospital / Sangha as a Hospital:**
    *   The monastic community (Sangha) is compared to a hospital. People enter to be "cured" (gain wisdom). Once cured, they don't typically stay forever; they may leave to help their "family" (society). This explains the fluidity of ordination and disrobing in Thai Buddhism.

4. **AI / Self-Driving Cars:**
    *   Contrasts rule-based vs. wisdom-based living. Old software follows strict traffic rules (like societal or religious precepts). Modern AI has a simple goal: "go fast and don't hit anything." Similarly, noble right view moves from a list of rules to wise investigation and adaptation to the present moment.

5. **Synchronicity vs. Magic:**
    *   Meaningful coincidences (synchronicity) are presented as a natural feature of an interconnected reality. The "ordinary" or "magical" view is to think *you* control or cause these events for personal gain. The "noble" or "real" view is to simply observe them with awe and delight, without claiming ownership.

6. **Thomas Edison's Light Bulb:**
    *   Used to reframe failure. Edison's 1,000 attempts weren't failures but a process of elimination ("99% perspiration"). Similarly, on the path, mistakes are not sins but **learning opportunities**, essential for discovery.

7. **Popping Pimples / Asavas:**
    *   The mental defilements (*āsavas*) are compared to pimples or blackheads. The practice is like a dermatologist removing them **one at a time, mind moment by mind moment**, not all at once.

8. **The Horror Movie Scene:**
    *   Illustrates the difference between **doubt** (fearful, doesn't want to look) and **curiosity** (okay with not knowing, willing to investigate). Doubt is the audience screaming "Don't go down the dark hall!"; curiosity is going to look and often finding nothing threatening.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Socrates:**
    *   Told to illustrate the risk and purpose of asking the right questions. Socrates asked young Athenians probing questions to discourage them from joining a pointless war, which threatened the authorities and led to his execution. It frames assertive truth-seeking as a social act with consequences.

2.  **The FBI Monk:**
    *   A cautionary tale about boundaries. A man ordained as a monk in the U.S. to hide from the FBI. The story illustrates why the Sangha needs to screen for "ordinary right view" and cannot be a sanctuary for wrongdoers.

3.  **The Rice Harvest:**
    *   From the Buddha's time, a monk disrobed to help his aging mother harvest rice, then re-ordained later. This story is used to demonstrate the **flexibility and practicality** of early Buddhist monasticism, where family duty was a valid reason for leaving and returning.

4.  **Anecdote about Apology Languages:**
    *   Contrasts the Thai phrase *kho thôot* ("please beat me") with the Western "I'm sorry." This illustrates the difference between an **honor/shame (collectivist) culture** (where the community administers consequences) and a **guilt (individualist) culture** (where the individual internalizes punishment).

5.  **Dhammarato's Ordination Story:**
    *   He shares details of his own high-status ordination in Thailand, with many monks and prestigious preceptors. This story illustrates how the Sangha uses **status and ceremony** to honor and integrate newcomers, creating a powerful sense of belonging and "change of lineage."

6.  **The Airport & Tube Ads Anecdote:**
    *   The opening casual story about staying present during long flights and avoiding ads on the London Tube sets the stage. It's a microcosm of the larger talk: the battle against distraction and the cultivation of contentment in a world designed to provoke greed and boredom.

### **Thematic Purpose**
These metaphors and stories collectively serve to:
*   Demystify enlightenment by framing it as a gradual, stage-by-stage process.
*   Contrast rigid, rule-bound morality with flexible, wisdom-based living.
*   Validate the natural human process of learning through trial and error.
*   Explain cultural differences in ethics and psychology.
*   Defend the fluid, pragmatic structure of traditional monastic life.
*   Encourage a shift from fear/doubt to curiosity/okayness in spiritual practice.
