### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I know, I know I'm not very good at explaining myself sometimes.

**Speaker B:** And there you go again.

**Speaker A:** You go again.

**Speaker B:** Come on. All right, Joe, good to see you again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good to see you too.

**Speaker B:** And the first thing that we can talk about directly in, in all of this is how critical we are of ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you just showed me twice in a row your criticism of yourself. Okay, that you're— then this is what we need to work on a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Is the fact that when you catch the mind wandering away You don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Well, I wouldn't say— And so you're

**Speaker B:** trying to fix that.

**Speaker A:** I wouldn't say that I don't like it because, I mean, I realize that that's just what's going to happen. I mean, that's just how it is. Oh, okay. And it's okay.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker A:** No, and I mean, I do tell myself, oh, it's okay, this is just how it is. I mean, I don't think at that point that I'm very critical of it, because I mean, at this point, I mean, I've been catching my mind wandering for years now.

**Speaker B:** Well, then what's the question again?

**Speaker A:** So the question is more like there's something, there's a point of contact that comes when your mind is wandering, something happens that causes this. What is the point of contact that happens in order to catch that point of contact? Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Because it almost felt like there was nothing there. It felt like, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, we need to build something there. And what we need to build there is the skill of Sati. Yes, Sati is a skill to be developed. Okay, then in fact, that's throughout the Anapanasati Sutta. Thus one trains oneself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so there's many different ways of training oneself. But the clear and obvious answer right from the get-go is, is that mindfulness to make sure that this is an in-breath and mindfulness to make sure that this is an out-breath, then is in fact that establishing over and over again to be here in the present moment. Okay, that's a way of thinking about it, to remember. But what we're going to remember is to kind of be in the senses Anyway, okay, and that the breath is just part of the sensory system that we're in that we can experience in this present moment, as opposed to talking to ourselves about it, right? Okay, but we do a kind of a running dialogue about stuff all the time anyway. And that running dialogue is— you can think of it as your friend, that you're actually kind of explaining to yourself what you understand to be correct, that there's a lot of it. That's in fact the reestablishment of insight.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. So it's like you're changing the internal dialogue, like that's That's the whole idea, basically, is that you're changing the whole internal dialogue from being critical to something that's a little bit more wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so merely denying that that it was uncomfortable for you. You had to talk, you had to tell how you were trying to talk yourself out of it being uncomfortable. Did you notice that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is the whole way, is that we're not going to find the resting point in the middle until we explore the whole scope, or both sides and the decide that you haven't explored yet is the part of the joy. And the joy— there's many different ways of talking about this, but it's you keep coming back and re-nurturing and reassuring yourselves. And yes, I hear a bird and then I tell myself a story and that's okay that you're beginning to keep track of what's going on. But you're doing it in a loving and kind way. And you've heard me say this before, but I had an idea the other day with Kishon, and it struck a bell for him, and it did also for Robert. And that's an old song that was popular out of the 1960s and '70s by Simon and Garfunkel, and the name of it was "The Sound of Silence." But the lyrics go, "Hello darkness, my old friend." I've come to talk to you again. Now here we're not necessarily talking about darkness in the sense that you got the lights turned off and you got the door closed and you've got solitude. We're not talking about it in that way. We're talking about it in the way of any kind of thought forms that you have that you would see as a dark side. You can welcome that too. Hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk to you again. And you're doing it on a moment-by-moment level, but you can also think of it from time to time in the sense that a guy has got a girl on his mind and then he doesn't have her on his mind for a while and you think he's free from her. And then all of a sudden he's thinking about her again. Okay. And now he can look at that as hello darkness, my old friend. Those old thoughts have come back and I'm here to talk to you again about it. Okay. And we can do it in that kind of lyrical, uplifting, spiritual way, that we're beginning to see what's going on, and that's OK. That it really is OK, because we're all friends here. But the other side of it is, do you know Al Sharpton? Yeah, okay. He's got a show that often he ends it with the word gotcha. Okay, okay. That's the way that we want to talk about it also, is gotcha. Or the Buddha's words were, uh, aha, I see you, Mara. And that here we have another one is hello darkness, my old friend. And that's the kind of way of beginning to understand it, that,

**Speaker A:** uh, uh,

**Speaker B:** let's see, you are seeing something in the mind and then you don't like it and wanted to change it and make it better, rather than recognizing, oh, that's the way that the mind works, and you want to keep watching how the mind works.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And this is why we build the Sati, because in fact you had Sati there, but it wasn't high enough quality Sati so that you went right back into the hindrance of, oh, I should be better than this.

**Speaker A:** I don't think— no, I don't think I was doing that though, because like the way that it happened at that particular moment was I had this thought and then I had this thought about Sati. And then I said, oh, never mind, you don't have to think about that now either. You can drop it and you can ask Dhammarato later about it. And then I went back to it. And it was quite a pleasant time. And I mean, like when I'm sitting or laying down now, I'm getting quite long periods of like blankness though. And I'm just kind of sitting there and it's just kind of pleasant. And I think the main hindrance that I'm having now is kind of like, how long can I do this for? Like, I can sit there for a couple hours or lay there for a few hours, and then I'm like, wait a minute, should I like get up and go get something to eat or something? Or like— and that's the hindrance. Yeah, that's the hindrance. That becomes the main hindrance, I know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, before you're just saying, hey, you're just hanging out. Yeah, you're learning to hang out, congratulations. But when those thoughts come up, recognize those thoughts also as hindrances to hanging out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** if you don't have any, anything on mind, just sitting and enjoying it. This is a very relaxed, calm state. So begin to experience that and begin to experience that you can keep it going in the sense that you don't have thoughts of sandwiches come up that's going to disturb that state of mind. And when thoughts of sandwiches do come up, It's, hello darkness, my old friend, I've seen you before and you're not going to bug me right now. I'm having too much fun doing nothing at all. So that's, that's the approach in that regard, is to start recognizing any thought about what's not happening in this present moment that's not already fulfilling right here, right now. For instance, wanting food, you got to get up and go get that.

**Speaker A:** It's getting kind of to the point where almost everything seems pointless. Like, I've had this feeling before. Not in a bad way pointless, but just kind of like it doesn't really matter if it happens or if it doesn't happen. It kind of just is whatever.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly right. And this, for some people, brings on an existential crisis.

**Speaker A:** I've had this for a while, so it's not really that much of a crisis.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been there, done that, huh?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. A couple of years ago, it was a crisis when I was like, oh no, my identity is getting— like, what am I if I'm not this and not this? But now I'm kind of like, okay, whatever.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and then the next one is, well, what's the point? What's the meaning of life? And the answer is to that is that you put whatever meaning on it that you want to, and the less often you do that, the better off you are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so it doesn't really have to have any meaning. What we really need is security and safety, the feeling of everything is comfortable. And easy. That's the way of going. Okay, it's just the feeling of everything's okay, everything is easy. You keep playing with that over and over again. Then when little stories come, that's okay. The question is, is can you come back to the present moment and take a deep breath? That in fact you could They've said this for so many times and in so many ways, but we can think of the breathing itself as an anchor, that even if it didn't have any other benefit other than using it as an anchor for mindfulness, that it would serve its purposes just for that reason alone, just as an anchor. Just remember to take a deep breath. That's all we need to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** But then that drags in all of this other stuff, like number 1 comes in, a bit of investigation, which you're pretty good at. And then the next one, which is the really difficult for most people, is the right effort. Because once we reel that crap in and we see what a mess this is, And we don't want to actually deal with it by throwing it back out. And so once we get good at doing that, which is— that is in fact the point that every student struggles with on every possible level, and that is getting the right effort up. Okay, the seeing the wisdom, or the seeing it in the sense of seeing what there is that's in the mind— is this dangerous or not? Okay, so what we can say, the Buddha talks about it like this: we seek gratification, then we see the danger, and then the escape. This is actually in several sutras over and over again, that sequence, and that we do most of the things that we do out of habit because that's the easy way out. So we get gratification in the sense that it doesn't take any effort to sit here and feel bad, that in fact I like it. Poor me, plot my revenge. Feel good about it. Okay, this is— and we get great gratification out of that, not recognizing the dangers in it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the dangers, uh, partly is, is that, hey, I can be in better state than this, right? Why am I taking gratification in such low, mean places when I could actually take better gratification out of thinking that I am free from those kind of thoughts? So, once we see the danger in anything, then we can in fact find the effort to make the escape. But the first thing is Sati; the second thing is to see what it is for sure, to make sure, is this OK, or does this have dangerous aspects to it? That's the question that we can have in the sense of wholesome or unwholesome is one way of expressing it. But an easy way for us to understand it in English is, does it potentially carry danger? And if so, what are the trade-offs? Almost in the sense that we need to be able to, let us say, with wisdom, mindfully, quickly make a cost-benefit analysis over what's happening in this present moment. That would be the way of thinking about it. So what is the least dangerous way? Well, naturally, just relaxing and sitting and doing nothing is almost always the safest, most relaxed, easiest way of doing things. You just do nothing at all. That may not be the case. You don't want to do that while sitting on a railroad track when the train comes. Sometimes we need to listen, but always— in fact, not only just sometimes, but that's also one of the qualities of the practice, is even opening the ear door and start listening to things. That in fact, many meditation situations occur around noise in the retreat hall, because everybody wants it quiet. Everybody's supposed to be, you know, I mean, talk about a library being quiet. Libraries are noisy compared to the way it's supposed to be in a meditation hall, right? Right. Which means anytime you, uh, one person coughs and 100 people jump Yeah, okay. What does that mean? That means that they were all in space world rather than in their senses, in the here and now. When we are present in the here and now, then when we get information coming into the senses, we joyfully receive it rather than get surprised by it. So this is a part of being awake. And staying awake is to be in the present moment and stay in the present moment and not let the mind wander into stories. But it's very typical that that happens. You hear a bird and you tell yourself a story about it. Yeah, fine. How long does that story go? And does that story turn into a dead bird that you once felt bad over? And then a dead girl you felt bad over?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. But I find it really interesting to track what leads to what and what leads to— it's really interesting to see, like, okay, I started off thinking this and then this, and then all of a sudden I ended up here. And then I just think, never mind, it doesn't matter, start again. But it's kind of interesting to see, wow, this is crazy, that it starts off, it can be the smallest little whatever, and then all of a sudden it leads to something crazy off there. Yeah. And sometimes it's not a sound. Sometimes I try to track it and I'm like, wait a minute, I mean, there was nothing that happened. And I really like, I get this sort of game I play with myself where I'm like, all right, this time we're going to do a really good job and we're going to see how long we can do this. And so I maintain it, my mindfulness, for a while, and then inevitably it goes away again like it does.

**Speaker B:** And absolutely, yes, it does. But that's not the issue. The issue is, can you remember to come back joyfully when you do wake up?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So we've got a two-way street going here. The first thing is that we're going to now attach the mind in a new way to the breath. In the sense that you're going to kind of like play a game in your mind to get this set up, okay, or just set in, I guess. One of the expressions that you perhaps have heard is to practice like your hair is on fire. Yeah, have you ever heard of that?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, I've heard that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I can tell, right? I didn't even have to ask you because I could see you. Yeah, I've heard that before. What does that mean? Because besides the joke, I mean, I've been practicing like my hair was on fire, and so until there's no more hair, but We can think of that also as the breath. So the game that we can play is that the automatic part of the mind that does the breathing needs a rest, because it's sick and tired of doing all the work all of these years, and you want to make him a friend. Which means that We're going to start remembering and paying attention to the fact that we might die if we don't remember to breathe. Because it's up to us now, because we're going to let that part of the mind go to sleep and take a rest. Finally. I mean, it's been running long haul, keeping you alive by breathing all the time, all the time. You just forget about it altogether. So we can make part of that part of the mind there as a good friend for us. And so we're going to let him go take a rest for a while. And so now it's up to us to remember when we're breathing to do so. Okay? And this is the reason that I'm talking about it as being an anchor. I mean, this is the answer to your original question: how can you find Sati? The answer is, is that we're going to actually make this a task Yeah, so that we're going to breathe consciously, because that is how we get into Anapanasati, is through— by breathing in and out, we create the Sati that we're now going to be using for all of the gathering of the factors of Jhana. But we need to be here now, and the way to do that is by using the breath to wake up so that we can pay attention to what the mind is doing and paying attention. But we're doing that paying attention literally on that next deep in-breath. And so we're focusing more mind moments on the breathing as well as paying attention to the thoughts that we had, because it's actually quite easy to interrupt the thoughts by consciously taking a deep

**Speaker A:** breath,

**Speaker B:** because now you're paying attention to the breathing. And the best you could do about those thoughts that you just had is kind of recollect them or kind of remember them, because they're not that far in the distant past, but they'll float away very quickly if you keep watching the breath. Because they're not really important. I mean, that's the one thing that we kind of understand is, is that the monkey mind, every mind moment that there is there, none of them are really important because there's just so many of them, one after another after another. Anyway, why don't we just enjoy this one? And so all of those old thoughts can just float away. And one of the thoughts then that you're going to have is, wow, I'm glad all that stuff's gone. Which is the brightening of the mind. Okay, so this is kind of a way of looking at it, is yes, we are going to actually firmly attach our ideas that the right way to practice is that I'm going to remember my breathing as if it were life-giving itself, and that if I forgot to breathe, I'd die. And so you start watching for the breath. You want to make sure that you're working on it and so that you can empty it out completely, knowing that you're emptying it out completely because you have full control over the breathing. And then later, you can wait and then take an in-breath. And so becomes a game to play, a toy to play with. Allow yourself to get lightheaded by playing with it. That lightheadedness is in fact meaning that the body is getting oxygenated, the mind is getting oxygenated, because we're intentionally breathing in and then holding it and letting it out and breathing in a great big one, you know, and just getting it all energized and everything.

**Speaker A:** Thing.

**Speaker B:** It's a toy, but it's slower than it normally would be, and it's not shallow like it normally is. But in fact, one of the ways of talking about it is that if we were very active, like running through the jungle on the hunt, we would be breathing naturally. But in our society, normal breathing is much less than that. And so we could think of that we're going to start training the habit of remembering to breathe naturally and start breathing normally. Anagami is life-giving, is sustaining.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes after a while my breath feels like it's not there, and my mind kind of freaks out that I'm going to die or something. But I mean, usually what happens is that then I have to reassure myself, of course you're not going to die.

**Speaker B:** You don't have to reassure yourself with anything other than a really nice deep long in-breath. That's it. That's time to do it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So when it becomes really, really subtle, it's okay to take a really deep

**Speaker B:** breath at that point and— Absolutely. Yes. Take control of it and go back to that deep breathing again. Yes. It's very, it's very common for it to get very, very shallow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, it's not shallow. It's just like, it's just almost like it's not there.

**Speaker B:** It's like, That's what I— that's the definition of shallow.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Oh, that's okay. I thought you— because shallow, I thought you meant like, like kind of like short. I guess that would be short.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, those— yeah, okay, like you were running, right? Okay, okay. That's not shallow. Then in fact, people don't even like that kind of breathing, and so they talk about catching their breath. Let me catch my breath. Which is actually conscious breathing. When you sit and do it, this is actually Anapanasati step 2, is to consciously take long deep breaths. But we do it quickly so that it's a short breath, but it's not a shallow breath. Shallow breath is the kind of breathing that we do absent mindedly.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Or on automatic. And so what you can do is start playing with— in fact, whenever you're talking, that's a good time to watch what you're doing when you're talking. But if you've been a musician, you know about that too. Yeah, so start thinking about then the phrasing of your talking with your breath so that you can take control of your breathing and do mindfulness of breathing while talking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel like I'm forgetting how to talk sometimes too, because like I'm not talking to so many people and I'm just talking to you. So sometimes Like, I'm so— I'm like, like at the beginning I noticed I'm so excited because I haven't talked to anybody or like, you know, but yeah,

**Speaker B:** it's just— okay, well, these are all skills. This goes back to the same question that you asked, because number one, we're going to start breaking Sati, the skill that you want to learn to develop. The way to do it is tie it to the breath. And then tie it really strongly, intentionally to the breath. Okay. This is the Samma Sanghappa. This is in fact the attitude of I can take control over the breathing. And so that's— we begin to make that as the point of Sati. Yes, I'm going to remember. I'm going to remember. I'm going to remember. So that's the kind of way of practicing like your hero's on fire, is practicing like if you don't breathe intentionally, you're gonna die. And that helps, uh, that kind of mindset. But, uh, another way that's kind of subtly different than that that I can introduce, and that is, is that, hey, let's take a breath because it's really life-giving. Now that's the way of really looking at it, is rather than, oh, if I don't do it, I'll die— that sounds like some misery trip again— so let's take it up into, wow, this next breath is pretty marvelous. That for the Christians at this stage, when you talk about as I breathe in, I breathe in God. Yeah, I got nothing else but God to breathe. I mean, this is it. All of reality keeps coming in and just nourishes me on the inside, takes away all my crap and lets me breathe out. I can relax. Okay, so this is the part about it. This Anapanasati is because now we're going to actually use this as an anchor. I've talked to many things about it, but I've never put the intensity that it actually could be useful for you. Because this is how you do it. This is how you develop Sati, by taking the breath, taking it, seizing it as your object. Every in-breath, you seize it again.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes I feel like I've like wasted a lot of breaths in my life.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's okay because I made Bodhisattva.

**Speaker A:** It feels so good that I'm like, oh my gosh, I could have just been doing this.

**Speaker B:** Like, oh God,

**Speaker A:** it's so much more pleasant. It's such a more pleasant way of like feeling. But But then I just wonder, is that all that it is? Is it just pleasant? And because it doesn't matter, but I

**Speaker B:** mean, so you want it— that's how it is, and unpleasant, or you want that how it is pleasant? It's up to you, your choice, right?

**Speaker A:** I know,

**Speaker B:** but we have to remember to take that choice. And so using the breathing to do that is exactly the teaching of the Buddha, is let's use the breath to build Sati so that we can remember then to take a look at what's going on and then cheer it right up. I guess you could say it over and over again, over and over and over and over and over again. That's— it's got to be repeated over and over and over again, otherwise you're going to die. Right, within 2 minutes you're going to die, unless you're skilled at holding your breath for 2 minutes. And sometimes clarinet players can do that. I've never seen one go for 120 seconds, but I've seen clarinet players beat a trumpet player easy. They're jealous. Trumpet players, the best they could do is about 70 seconds, but I've seen clarinet players go well past 90. But 120, I don't I don't think so. We used to play that game all the time. I mean, that was like a contest at several of the places I've been. You probably played that game too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, hold the note the longest. Yeah, who can make the highest note?

**Speaker B:** That's the other game too, but the current is to the squeak when you get to high. So that's, that's the game then, to keep playing with your breathing over and over and over again. If you do that, that's going to be the trigger for Sati to be here now. You cannot play with your breath last month's breath, right? You got to play with it right now. So that's the one thing that brings us right into the here now. Is the breath. Once we get into the here and now, now there's a whole bunch of stuff to do, including the investigating, the brightening the mind, the really enjoying the present moment. The present moment, that's the Gordian Strip I like.

**Speaker A:** What did you say?

**Speaker B:** In this pleasant moment.

**Speaker A:** Ah, pleasant moment. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** in this present moment, right? Just enjoy the moment. That's where— what else could we do with this moment other other than just enjoying with our senses open.

**Speaker A:** One that I like is kindfulness. Who is it? Ajahn Brahm has that one that he says all the time. He's like, embrace yourself with kindfulness, like saying instead of mindfulness. It just reminded me of the Freudian slip thing.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. So that's the teaching, is just enjoy your life. I mean, you have been dedicating your life to somebody else's laws, rules, rituals your whole life, and now you can just sit and enjoy your life. But you got to learn how to do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the way you do that is by remembering to do it. And the way you remember to do it is remember that if you don't breathe, you're going to die. And so enjoy this next breath. It's life-giving. I mean, it really does feel good to breathe in. The air is sweet. I suppose that that would be true in the sense that if people lived in a city and they started doing Anapanasati, they want to move out to the country. 'Cause the air here on the island is just so nice, it's so sweet, just a teeny, teeny hint of salt. But we're 50 yards from the ocean, but we've got ocean all around. So there's just a bit of salt in the air, but not enough to detect unless you're really looking for it. And the barometric pressure goes up and down, which is very interesting with the air. So the air is actually quite a trip to play with, whether we're breathing it in or just playing with it naturally. It's just all around us. And so beginning to play with the atmosphere, because we live in this soup and we generally don't pay attention to the air around us, only generally when there's something so wrong with it that it's obnoxious and we don't like it, and then we pay attention to it rather than paying attention to it because it's just so nice.

**Speaker A:** It's, uh, it's wintertime. It's wintertime here, and there's this crisp crispness to the air. Yeah, that's awesome.

**Speaker B:** I really like that crispness in the air.

**Speaker A:** There's something when you get that first really cold day, like, oh man, it's like, I can't describe it. People who don't like winter, I always like, you just don't understand, like the, ah, that breathing in when you walk out the door and just the cold just lights lights you up.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, lights you right up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm a northerner, so that's just, yeah, how it is.

**Speaker B:** No, it's the attitude though. And you can take that attitude up north and you can take that attitude down south. You take it to the island, you take it to the city, you can take it wherever you want to because you've got control, right, of your own breathing. That's the way to look at it, is that once you can control your breathing, then you can control your whole life. But in fact, if you don't consciously breathe, you will die mentally and go back into the past. Yeah, off to the future or someplace else other than Being here now. So put that on it too, and now you got some real reason to play that game of if you don't watch your breath, you're going to die, because you will. But guess what? You can come back alive anytime you remember, right? So don't worry about it so much. Just be here now as many times as you can, and when you do, enjoy the heck out of it. Start to ponder over why I wasn't here before now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. No, I love that. I love that it's always waiting for you. Like, that's such a beautiful feeling that it's always forgiving. It's always there. It's just waiting, you know. Yeah, that's one thing I always really enjoy about it is that the whole It's not a game you can lose because, you know, I just had to

**Speaker B:** remember you could set the rules to the game. That's the part that most people don't understand. That's the part that most people don't understand. The Buddha calls that— that's a big deal in the teaching of the Buddha, but it's not really recognized very well for— in Western Buddhism. The Pali term is Sila, Bhikkhuni, paramasa, which means that it's instinctual through our nesting instinct that we attach to rights, rules, and rituals. This is one of the four modes of clinging that the Buddha talks about. And those four modes of clinging really line up very well with the four instincts. I've talked about that to many students. So this instinct of the nest, if you're going to stay in the nest, you got to follow the rules of the nest. And if you take over the nest, you've got to keep the rules or the people in the nest will throw you out of your boss's position. And so once tradition goes, that's the set of rules and everybody's got to go by them without anybody thinking about them at all.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And the young snot-nosed kid is smart and all of that, and he can go see through it. He tries to talk the rest of the tribe into it. They don't want to have anything to do with it because they're so tradition-bound, right? You can see that's so natural. Okay, well, we play that same game within ourselves, and each one of us attached to naturally a set of rules, and you've been following those guidelines, you've been following those rules, and because of that, not just personally, Joe, but I mean everybody.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but, but right now we're talking about Joe is following a set of rules that's also known on the other side of it as destiny, providence, or God's plan for you. Yes, that is God's plan for you, and he gave you that plan in the form of all of the rules orders, rituals, ways of doing things, what you think that society expects from you, etc., like that. And you've been following God's plan. And guess what? Now you're recognizing, yeah, you have been, and it sucks. And we need to stop following God's plan and start following our own plan. And our own plan is, I'm just going to relax. I don't got no plate to do. I got no Plan. That's the thing. Let's have no plan. We do not have to follow God's plan, but why pick up a new one? We set down all bad habits and we don't pick up new ones. Well, that God that we're talking about here is actually what we think of as children, as the authority figures. And so we learn it from authority. And in the big sense, the big authority is God. But really, no, it's just the repetition of the same old rules that people have been following all along, rather than recognizing, you drop all the rules. Let's have one new rule: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And we're going to side on Dukkha, Nirodha. We're going to put an end to those rules and put an end to all of the suffering. Comes along with doing it the way you were told to do it. And take a deep breath and just relax. So that's the way they look at it, Joe, is just throw the stuff out because it's not your rules anyway. Your new rule is, I'm going to watch my breath or I'm going to die.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And treat that very joyfully because it's a silly joke, but it's also a deep metaphor.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I'm definitely gonna carry that with me. There was something that clicked there for sure about something that you said. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Alright.

**Speaker B:** Well, I hope you can remember to breathe. Otherwise, I might not ever do it. Okay, it's so good. I mean, I like it just to sit here, just breathe. It's just so— enjoy your next breath.

**Speaker A:** Okay, thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student (Speaker A), focuses on **developing mindfulness (sati) through conscious breathing (ānāpānasati) and transforming one's inner relationship with thoughts.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Problem: Self-Criticism and the Wandering Mind**
The discussion begins by highlighting the student's habit of self-criticism when noticing the mind has wandered. The teacher points out that the issue isn't the wandering itself, but the **unwholesome reaction** of dislike or frustration toward it.

**The Solution: Building Sati (Mindfulness)**
The primary tool offered is developing **sati** as a skill. The direct and practical method is to **tie mindfulness firmly to the breath**.
*   **The Breath as an Anchor:** The breath is always in the present moment. By consciously remembering and feeling each in-breath and out-breath, we anchor ourselves in the "here and now."
*   **A Life-or-Death Game:** To build strong, urgent sati, the teacher suggests a playful yet profound mindset: **practice as if your life depends on remembering to breathe.** If you forget to breathe consciously, you "die" (i.e., fall back into unconscious, distracted thinking). This makes the breath a constant, vital point of return.
*   **From Anchor to Joy:** This practice isn't grim. Once anchored, the goal is to **find joy and pleasure in the present moment**—in the simple act of breathing, the feeling of the air, and the calm of "just hanging out."

**Transforming the Inner Dialogue**
A major theme is changing our relationship with thoughts.
*   **From Criticism to Kindfulness:** Instead of criticizing the mind for wandering, greet thoughts with a friendly, observational attitude. The teacher uses the lyric **"Hello darkness, my old friend"** as a metaphor for welcoming all thoughts—even recurring or "dark" ones—without judgment, to understand how the mind works.
*   **Catch and Release:** Use the conscious breath to gently interrupt thought chains. Notice a thought, take a deep breath to return to the present, and let the thought float away. The key is to **return joyfully**, not grudgingly.
*   **Seeing the "Pointlessness":** The student describes a state where things seem "pointless" in a neutral, peaceful way. The teacher reframes this as freedom from fabricated meanings and plans, leading to a sense that **"everything is okay, everything is easy."**

**Overcoming Hindrances**
*   **Hindrances are Just More Thoughts:** Even subtle thoughts like "How long can I do this?" or "Should I get food?" are identified as hindrances to the pleasant, calm state. Meet them with the same friendly "Hello, old friend" and return to the breath.
*   **The Sequence of Insight:** The talk references the Buddha's framework: we seek gratification in habits (e.g., rumination), then must **see the danger** in those habits (they prevent peace), to find the **escape** (letting go via mindfulness).

**Dropping the "Rules" and "God's Plan"**
The teacher makes a deeper philosophical point: we suffer by blindly following internalized rules, rituals, and societal expectations ("God's plan"). The path of Dhamma is about **dropping all those burdensome plans** and adopting one simple, personal rule: to watch the breath and end suffering (**dukkha nirodha**) by choosing peace in the present moment.

**In Essence:** The talk is a practical guide to using the breath to cultivate a moment-to-moment mindfulness that is **joyful, kind, and liberating**. It emphasizes that the practice is a forgiving, always-available game where you set the rules—the main rule being to remember to breathe and enjoy being alive, right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, likely a meditation teacher) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate mindfulness, self-criticism, and meditation practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Hello darkness, my old friend"** – A lyric from Simon & Garfunkel's *The Sound of Silence*. Used as a metaphor for welcoming and making peace with recurring negative or distracting thoughts ("dark" thought forms) instead of fighting them. It reframes the relationship with mental hindrances.

2.  **The Breath as an "Anchor"** – A common mindfulness metaphor. The breath is something stable you can "drop" your attention onto to return to the present moment when the mind wanders.

3.  **"Gotcha!" / "Aha, I see you, Mara"** – Metaphors for the moment of recognition when you catch the mind wandering. It's a playful, alert acknowledgment of distraction (like Al Sharpton's "gotcha" or the Buddha addressing the tempter, Mara).

4.  **"Practice like your hair is on fire"** – A metaphor for practicing meditation with extreme urgency, dedication, and intensity.

5.  **Breathing as a "Toy" or "Game"** – The practice of mindful breathing is framed as a playful activity to engage with, not a chore. This includes the specific "game" of consciously taking over the breathing from the autonomic system.

6.  **"Running Dialogue" as a Friend** – The internal monologue is metaphorically described as a friend you're explaining things to, rather than an enemy. The work is to change this internal dialogue from critical to kind.

7.  **"Monkey Mind"** – A classic metaphor for the restless, jumping nature of ordinary thought.

8.  **The "Gordian Strip"** – This appears to be a misstatement/mix of "Gordian Knot," used to mean a complex problem. Here, the speaker corrects to "pleasant moment," suggesting the simple solution (enjoying the present) cuts through life's complexity.

9.  **Life as a "Soup" of Air** – A metaphor for the atmosphere we live within but usually ignore, to encourage sensory awareness of the present environment.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Man Thinking About a Girl** – A brief story to illustrate the "Hello darkness" metaphor. A man thinks he's free from thoughts of a girl, then they return. He can greet those thoughts as an "old friend" instead of judging them.

2.  **The Meditation Hall & Noise** – An anecdote about how meditators get startled by a cough because they are in "space world" (lost in thought) instead of being present in their senses. This contrasts being "surprised by" versus "joyfully receiving" sensory input.

3.  **The Autonomic Mind as a Tired Friend** – A personification story: The part of the mind that automatically controls breathing is a tired friend who has worked for years. We can be a good friend by consciously taking over the breathing to give it a rest.

4.  **The Musician's Breath-Holding Contest** – A personal anecdote about clarinet and trumpet players competing to hold a note the longest. This story serves to connect the practice of breath control to a playful, skillful game, making the concept more relatable and tangible.

5.  **Following "God's Plan" vs. Your Own Plan** – An extended metaphorical story about how societal rules, expectations, and internalized authority act as a "destiny" or "God's plan." The path of liberation is framed as ditching that pre-written plan to follow your own simple rule: watch your breath and end suffering.

### **Core Function of These Devices**
The teacher uses these metaphors and stories to:
*   **Reframe the relationship** with thoughts (from criticism to friendly observation).
*   **Make abstract concepts** (mindfulness, right effort) concrete and memorable.
*   **Inject playfulness and joy** into practice, countering self-judgment.
*   **Create visceral, practical instructions** (e.g., breathe as if your life depends on it).
*   **Connect ancient teachings** (Buddha's words) to modern cultural references (song lyrics, Al Sharpton).
