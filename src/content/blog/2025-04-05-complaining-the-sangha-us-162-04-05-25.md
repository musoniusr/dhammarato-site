### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Welcome. It's Saturday morning in Thailand, Friday evening in the US. And today we're going to be talking about Kali and Metta friendships and things like this. Santiago, will you fill us in on the question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a question was asked about Kalyana Metta, noble friendship versus worldly friendship, or like regular friends, and about obligations in relationship.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, in the Pali, the word that we're looking for is Kaliyametta. And actually, we're going to use that word in relationship to some other words that you've probably not encountered. So the Kaliyametta actually is a spiritual friend, and a spiritual friend, the Kaliyametta, to you would be someone who fulfills the role of mentor or teacher or something like that. Now that's different than what we would consider an acharya. Now for generally, we think of an acharya as someone who is ordained monk has been ordained for more than 10 years. And having been ordained for more than 10 years, he's ready then to take on students. Now, that 10 years is not an automatic thing. It's just kind of a suggestion. And it has to do with circumstances, including his own teachers. So we have an Achan who is more formal, and he's going to have a number of students, and that we use that word only for ordained monks. So a layman would not use the designation of Achan. But for Kaliya Metta, that can be one person who maybe he's got no other spiritual friends other than the new person. And so the new person then would consider him a mentor, or in fact what the word actually means is spiritual friend. Or friend in Metta. And then we have the situation with just students communicating with one another, and they can play back and forth the term of Kaliya, Metta, whatever they're talking about. And that we also have the issue of the designation of nobility. That in an ideal situation, the Achan is going to be noble, but that's not always the case, especially if he's designated himself as an Achan or his teacher may not be noble. But generally within the Thai system, the Thai tradition, nobility is well enough established Ben, can you turn your mic off?

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker A:** So with the, um, with the issue of noble nobility, we would call them then a noble friend. Now the way that you would relate to noble friends is a little bit differently than you would relate to ordinary people in the world. And also you would relate differently to noble friends than you would to, say, someone that you were in a close relationship, perhaps family relationship. So now we have all of these designations. We have family, we have ordinary people, maybe friends, we have noble friends, we have Kaliya Metta, and we have an Arahant. So these would be the various relationships that we would have. Let's discuss some of them. So in general, there would be things that you would do for all of these, and that we would use these relationships then in order to practice the Dharma. In other words, when we're talking to other people, no matter who they are, we're going to have certain standards that we're going to keep. One of the standards would be, um, let's not use, uh, well, let's actually look at it from the perspective of the precepts of Right Noble Speech. In the sense that you wouldn't lie to a person, you wouldn't lie to your friends, all right? You wouldn't engage in malicious gossip. You wouldn't, um, uh, be using, uh, what we considered harsh language or calling people names. And that the one that's, um, let us say that the easiest one to fall into would then be trivial speech. And I would consider politics as, in general, trivial speech. In other words, talking about candle wax and cabbages and kings, I think the poem goes. None of those things are really worth discussing at all. That in fact, if we are going to have noble speech, the best thing to do is to talk about right here, right now. Now, another point that we can consider along with the noble speech would be to not complain. In fact, we need to talk about complaining from either direction. But one of the things that we can begin to understand even on Discord here, is that we're not going to complain. Not complain about the weather, not complain about the kings, not complain about the.

**Speaker C:** Candle wax or the cabbages, not complain.

**Speaker A:** About each other, and especially not complain about my own mind, which I see a lot on Discord. If people complaining, and that, um, uh, in the— for this purpose of this call, let us say then that that's a point to look for. To look for, are you complaining about something? And if you are complaining and you can see yourself complaining, you can change the topic. You can look for something else to talk about. So that would be a good way of looking at it. In fact, possibly the very best way is that anytime that you're engaged with another person, in all cases, no matter who it is, this is the time to practice Dhamma. This is the time for— you talk about meditation, okay, this is your meditation time, is when you're dealing with other people. Make sure that your speech is correct. Make sure that your speech is wholesome. Make sure that your speech is, let us say, encouraging. This would be the way to handle other people regardless of what kind of relationship that you have with them. Now the question would be, How do you handle other people complaining? Most likely, a Kaliyametta is not going to complain. More than likely, a Kaliyametta is not going to complain. Hopefully, your noble friends are not going to complain. That leaves you with the ordinary people who are either friends and family or strangers. Now the funny part about it is, is that strangers generally don't complain. Now they might complain if they're at a service center, let us say a Walmart place where you return goods. It's actually quite possible for you to return merchandise and not complain. However, the complaint department— they even call it the complaint department because they know that people are going to complain when they're returning goods. And so, uh, you can actually then say, all right, if you're here to complain about something, the complaint department is open. Now, one of the things about a complaint department staff is that they're trained not to complain back. All right, so, uh, A way of thinking about it is that you can commiserate with someone. You can say, "Oh, I understand that you want to complain. Oh, I understand that you don't like this product," or better still, "I understand that you want to complain about you can't meditate for some reason." In fact, I hear that often. I hear that quite often from people who say it's hard to meditate. And that what we can in that regard, we can point out that actually look at the fact that you're complaining. Meditate on that for a moment. Recognize that you are complaining and that there is no need to complain. You in fact can accept yourself just like you would— I mean, if you took something back to Walmart and took it to the complaint department, That doesn't mean that you're going to storm out of Walmart and never come back, though that's happened many times. I've even done that myself, complained about GM to the point that I had a rule in my mind that I would never buy another GM product, and then I wound up with GM products. I've never had that with with Walmart when I was a young man. When I'd go shopping, yeah, I could return things to Walmart. So that's also what happens with us, is when we go to complain about something, if we don't like the response that we get when we're complaining, we may storm out and not have any more to do with that person. Check that out in your own mind. Recognize that just because you're complaining doesn't mean that you've got to take an axe to the relationship. Also, when you're complaining, why don't you right then and there take an axe to your complaining attitude? That you can ask a question or straighten something out without having, um, let's say, that mentality of complaining, that you don't like it. All right. This is especially valuable with relationships. In fact, possibly you could say that the number one cause of divorce is not money. The number one cause of divorce is complaining. That you're either complaining about yourself and what you don't like, or you're complaining about your partner. So if you can start to watch your mouth and not complain, you probably won't go around destroying things and destroying relationships. So this would be one of the things that we could say on this particular video. This is the main message, is when you're in a relationship with someone, whether it's an acquaintance family, friends, noble, uh, Kaliya, Metta, or Anicca, don't complain. So I remember from time to time when I would be around Achan Po, that people would come and complain to him, and his general response was sitting there and grunting and clearing his throat from time to time. And that's all he would give them as a response. Why was that? Because he knew that if someone was there to complain about something at Wat Chuan Mok, more than likely when they left him, they'd go someplace else and complain. Which meant then that if he didn't have to deal with people's complaints, they'd go get their complaints solved someplace else because other people would listen to complaints. But Ajahn Po, he wouldn't listen to the complaints. So, Josie, you got your hand up. I suppose you've got a question. Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yes, you touched on it a little because Ajahn Po doesn't, like, wouldn't listen to complaints. But there's something in this sutta about, like, not dwelling with ignoble people and walking away at some point. Like, when do you recommend someone walking away? Like, in that case, he wouldn't have walked away anyway. Obviously, he lives at the wat. There's nowhere to go. Or do you always recommend like more of like a nothing response, equanimity kind of thing that Ajahn Koh did versus walking away? Like what? I was going to ask at one point, do you walk away? And then this, the story never walked away even though it kind of keeps the similar thing.

**Speaker A:** Well, sometimes, right?

**Speaker D:** Like you can't do that, so you have to walk away. When do you walk away?

**Speaker A:** Since Ajahn Po was probably on his porch or in his sala receiving guests, sometimes even lines, he's not going to walk away. He's going to wait until the people get tired of complaining. In fact, what you're bringing up reminds me of a story that's in the sutta where a man came to the Buddha complaints. In fact, he was quite angry. It was specific that he was angry, and he was complaining to the Buddha in his anger. And the Buddha just sat there, let him basically get it out of his system, let him complain away. And then what the Buddha did was that he asked him a question, and the question was, if you were throwing a dinner party If you had prepared for guests and the guests may or may have not shown up, but when they did not show up, or if they did and then left without eating your food after you prepared that meal, who owns that meal? Because nobody ate it. And the man had to admit that If I prepared all of that food and nobody came to the party, then I guess that food is still mine. And then the Buddha pointed out to him, well, you've brought your dinner of anger and I'm not eating it. Therefore, who does the anger belong to? So this is a way of looking at it. Don't take your complaints to people. Because you don't want them to eat it. So turning that around, if someone is.

**Speaker C:** Complaining to you, you don't have to eat it. You don't have to eat what they're selling. Just like Ajahn Po, he just didn't have any response to it. Now, if you have the opportunity to walk away Go ahead. Then in fact, I highly recommend that in the case of— there's one particular kind of complaining that I would call an argument. That if somebody wants to argue, the easy thing to do is say, oh, I've got to go to the restroom, I've got to go to the toilet, I'll be right back.

**Speaker A:** And then you don't come back.

**Speaker C:** Leaving them again with their argument, leaving them with their complaints. Um, if there is, let us say, a position that you're in— let us say that you've offended someone and they're complaining about the fact that you've offended them— then you can hear that out, figure out whether they're correct or not, This takes some wisdom because normally we just want to reject it all. They don't know what they're talking about, where in fact they've got a legitimate complaint. So you can actually, if you can, repair that. You can fix it.

**Speaker A:** Because you want.

**Speaker C:** To have the relationship in a good state. So if you do have someone who is complaining legitimately That basically what that means is, is that there was a time in the past when you were not meditating, you were not careful, you were not listening to what was going on. You actually offended someone to where, um, I would say offhand that, uh, some people would say, well, maybe what that means is the Buddha never offended anyone, and that's not true. That in fact he would tell the truth, and that if the truth offends, then it's not freeing right there in that moment. In fact, there's a very famous statement. This statement is not Buddhist. I understand from history that this was published in the New York Times. I've forgotten who was credited with it, but she said that no, she had heard it someplace else. But here's The statement, and it is a take on what Jesus said. Jesus said, ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. But the rest of the statement is, but first it's going to piss you off. So if you tell somebody the truth and it pisses them off, they're just pissed off at the truth. Not at you. And so we can actually handle that. That actually happens in noble relationships, I'd say, quite often. When somebody comes to complain and you mention that they're complaining, they may not like that. They get pissed off when you mention that they're complaining. Well, what are we going to do about that? Well, we're certainly not going to eat their complaints. We're just going to leave it there, or perhaps we can, um, do a better explanation. But in fact, that's, um, one of the things that I have seen happen quite often on, uh, our Discord group is to— somebody comes in to complain and then somebody else hits them with the truth, and they don't like that. And then another noble friend will come in and appease the situation. So in that regard, you probably heard the situation of good cop, bad cop, which happened— it was invented for police investigations where The bad cop comes in and accuses the person of the crime, and they say, oh no, I didn't do it. And then the bad cop leaves and the good cop comes in and says, there, there, now everything is going to be okay, please tell me all about it. And that's when they get the confession. All right, so this is actually something that can be done in teamwork. I've seen it actually happen spontaneously. In fact, because of the training and whatnot like that, I'm quite willing to be the bad cop. So somebody comes on and complains, and I'll say, "Ah, you're complaining.

**Speaker A:** You're.

**Speaker C:** Saying, 'Oh, I can't meditate.'" And my response from the bad cop would be, "Oh, why don't you just watch what you're saying?" That's the meditation right then and there. In fact, Ivan and I have played good cop, bad cop right there on.

**Speaker A:** Discord.

**Speaker C:** Is that right, Ivan? You remember doing that with me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's very funny.

**Speaker C:** And not only that, but the best— but the point that I'm making is that it works. And it's also possible that you can play good cop, bad cop. Or actually, the best way of looking at it is if you play good cop, good cop, good cop, and when they're not getting it, that's when you come in and play bad cop. You tell them the truth, and then they don't like that, and then you can switch back to being good cop again. So this is the way that you can handle it, especially when you're in a situation like on Discord, where we're expecting people to make changes. I would not suggest that you do that out in public, though. That the way to handle that in public, people that you don't know, would be, as Jonesy recommends, is just walk away. Or just sit there with a smile on your face. You don't have to, in fact, fix that person. They're not even asking you to fix them. They're just wanting to complain. Everybody here has been in the habit of complaining before, and it's a habit. Sometimes it's hard to come out of that habit. So the question is, can you in fact not jump into that habit when other people are trying to give you that habit? When they're trying to bring it up so that you will go along, commiserate with them, say, yeah, ain't it awful? Then in fact, I'd like to give you that statement as a playful statement. So when somebody comes to complain, you could just say, ain't it awful? In fact, I give you that statement for when you start to complain yourself. You're sitting there and you're pretending to meditate, and then you start complaining about your meditation to yourself. You can come up with. Yeah, ain't it awful? I can't complain. I mean, I can't meditate. Oh, poor me. But we can do it in a funny, singsongy way as a way of waking up. You can become your own court jester. But in fact, that's the duty of the court jester, the Joker, is to be able to tell the truth and not get his head cut off. And so, um, this is historic in, in court situations that someone has got to play the Joker. And so you can say then that the bad man is the Joker. He's going to come in and say something really weird, get somebody's attention, and then If there is a friend that's on Discord with you, like Ivan, then he can come in and play good cop. But out in the world, we don't have that situation, so you don't have the opportunity. But you would in your family. Like, for instance, if your daddy and your daughter comes in to complain, You can in fact use this. So what I'm actually saying in a way is you have an opportunity to practice Dharma every interaction. Every time that you open your mouth or every time you open your ears, that's the time to practice Dhamma. Now, I would go so far also as to when someone is complaining or when someone is trying to make a statement, part of your job is to listen. That in fact, if you're in class, that's an important time to listen. That would be your practice, that would be your meditation, that if you're in a classroom situation and the teacher is there to part— information, your job is to listen. A lot of people think that their job is to take notes, but often when you're taking notes, you're not listening. You hear something and then you write it down, and while you're reading, writing it down, you miss the punchline. So I would recommend, instead of taking notes, maybe take a recorder or something that's going to take the notes automatically for you so that you can actually, when you're in a situation with a boss, with a teacher, um, in ordinary, uh, existence. Your job is to pay attention, to listen to what's going on. A next point would be, what about when you're out driving the car? The answer then is, now is the best time that you can meditate. Right now your job is to pay attention, to pay attention to the road. Pay attention to where you're going. We can also use that in other situations. An example would be, suppose that you're sick or maybe very tired and you say, "Oh, I'm too tired to meditate." Being tired, that's the absolutely best time to meditate. What do I mean by that? "Oh, well, I'm tired right now." That's okay. I'll just sit here and enjoy being tired. Or if I'm sick, that's the best time to practice. In fact, this is something that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said, that when you're sick, the best time to meditate is when you're sick. Instead of saying, oh, I'm too tired, oh, I'm too sick to meditate, the answer to that would be right now is the best time. Then in fact, any time that you're in a negative state, Let us say, anytime that the mind has hindrances in it, anytime that the mind has obstructions, unwholesome thoughts, instead of saying, "Oh, my mind is clouded, oh, I'm too worried to meditate," the answer to that would be, guess what? Oh no, now is the time to pay attention. Look at that worry. Recognizing that, huh, ain't it awful, I'm so worried? Then you can lighten up. Now, someone recently asked, well, if you're sick, wouldn't you want to pray to get better? The answer to that is you don't have to pray to the outside. There's no Sky Daddy, there's no deity up there that's going to help you to feel better. But you can make yourself feel better by being okay with you being sick. I'll do it tomorrow. Right now I'm sick. Let me enjoy being sick. I'm tired right now. Let me enjoy being tired. So this is also a way of handling your own mind instead of complaining, oh, I'm too sick to meditate, oh, I'm too tired to meditate, or oh, I'm too worried to meditate. We can say, "Hey, Mr. Bad Cop, I need you right now. Come in there and whack me. Wake me up." And then we bring in the good cop and just say, "Yeah, everything's all right. No worries, no problems." So you have that dual job to do with yourself. One is the waking up, and the second part would be the nurturing. Now, normally what happens is, is that we'll just be critical. We'll just have bad cop, bad cop, bad cop over and over and over again. That's not the solution. That we, if we're bad copying ourselves, we can also bad cop other people. We can complain and complain and complain and complain. In fact, that's probably the most notorious cause of divorce, is we just keep yapping and not ever come to any conclusion. So this is how we handle other people, is we handle their complaints by either silence or walking away or playing good cop, bad cop. It depends upon the situation. And you could say generally, when you're dealing with someone that you don't know well, you don't have any responsibility at all to fix them. You don't have any relationship. This would be like there's no reason for you to get involved with politics because politics is not your business. Well, if you're a politician, then politics is your business. But then I would recommend that if you're a politician, Look at what you're doing. If you look closely, you'll probably quit that job. There's a whole lot of jobs that I would recommend that people do not keep. If you're going to be Dhamma dude, there are a lot of jobs that actually the job itself is dispensing Dukkha to people. Cops don't become a policeman. I've had 4 or 5 different cops who have come to me about the Dhamma. And my recommendation, after I get to know them, was, if you want to practice Dharma, you got to quit that job. Another one would be a court judge, politician, used car salesman. Anytime that you're trying to make somebody else do something for a living, I would recommend that you change that job. Yes, Jonesy, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Since you brought up vocation anyway, cosmetology opinion.

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker D:** Like opinion on cosmetology as a vocation. Cosmetology is like a beautician.

**Speaker C:** Well, You could say cosmetology then is dealing mostly with women about their complaining about the way that they look. So I would say that instead of seeing yourself as a cosmetologist in that profession, you could say that what I'm here to do is to help people to stop complaining about the way they look. That in fact, possibly the best thing that you can do when someone comes into the cosmetologist to get themselves painted is to make them, help them to feel better about themselves. Play good cop with them. We have one of our friends here who, due to family situation, had to take a second job, and the easiest job for him to take would be, because it fit his schedule and other things, was to be a bartender. And I say, okay, you can take that job as a bartender, but remember that your job is to not tend bar and sell alcohol. Your job is to help people to feel good about themselves when they come into the bar. That if you can get somebody to have one drink and feel good about himself after one drink, then he'll stop drinking. But if he feels bad and drinks and feels bad and drinks, he can get really, really drunk and still feel bad about himself, maybe even start a fight. And so there are certain kinds of professions that you can get that point across for yourself, is that you don't have to be a cosmetologist You can be a psychotherapist with an art studio behind you. That's the way to look at it, is that you're not there to paint people's faces because they feel bad; you're there to help them to see that it doesn't matter how they look on the outside, because if they will have a beautiful attitude about what's on the inside, then they're going to be beautiful people. And in fact, I will go so far as to say that because of, let us say, the circumstances in the time of the Buddha, that they did have mirrors, but almost always a mirror was polished metal. They did not have the kind of mirrors that we have with glass with a silver backing like we have in modern times. So when we talk about a mirror in the time of the Buddha, We're talking about something precious, something expensive. And the Buddha then made an injunction about having mirrors. Well, I really like that idea. I like it for everybody. Let's start avoiding mirrors. Why? Because if I'm ugly, that's other people's problem. I don't have to look in the mirror. I don't have to see myself and think I'm ugly. And want to go to the cosmetologist. I don't need that. So, for this, avoid that kind of reflection for yourself. And if you do, you can say, "Hmm, handsome man!" Or, "Wow, I'm okay, I'm gorgeous already, I don't need to put on any makeup." So this is the way of looking at it. It's all a matter of your own attitude. And that anytime that you're dealing with customers, have that attitude of now is the time to practice. When you're sick, have that attitude. Now is the time to practice. When you're in a conversation where somebody's complaining, Remember, now is the time to practice the Dharma. You have a choice, if you can remember that you've got a choice. But if somebody comes to complain to you, and you don't like what they're saying, if they're complaining, if they're in fact condemning you, if they're criticizing you, That's the absolute most important time that you need to practice. Why? Because if they're complaining to you, if they are criticizing you, more than likely they're not criticizing you at all. They're criticizing something that's in their own mind. But that's where we normally deal. Ordinary people don't deal with other people. They deal with the situation in their own mind. You don't have to buy into it. You don't have to see it that way. So when somebody comes in criticizing, oh, you're so ugly, you can say, I don't see anybody here that's ugly. So this is the way of practice. In a way, we can say that whether somebody is in front of us whether it's an Achan, or you're the Achan, or Kali Ametta, noble friends, family, ordinary friends, or strangers, the way to behave is always the same. Watch what you're doing. Watch what you're thinking. This, when you're around other people, is the best time to meditate, but it's also the best time to meditate only when you have the skill of meditating. And where do we gain the skill of meditating? Is by going off on our own into seclusion, where we're only there looking at the fact that our own mind is doing all the complaining anyway. Just like Ajahn Po, when he would sit there and let people complain, he probably doesn't even have the thought, 'Oh, they're complaining.' He just has the thought, 'Oh, they're here.' Then when we call somebody complaining, remember that we made that shit up. So when somebody's complaining, when somebody's criticizing, recognizing that they made that up and that you're making up what you're making up about what they made up. And there's nothing real here. So this is the way of handling things, is just to wake up and recognize that they're just doing what they're doing, and that you can stop doing what you've been doing and wake up and handle it more correctly. Santiago, do you have a question about this?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't. It's wonderful.

**Speaker C:** Dhamma dude, Dhamma das dude, hello, good to see you, friends.

**Speaker A:** How you doing?

**Speaker C:** Do you have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** No, thank you though.

**Speaker C:** How about you, Eddie? Do you have anything to say? I like everything you said so far, the whole bad cop thing. And if I'm ugly, that's your problem.

**Speaker A:** That's cool.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, that's your problem. All I see is beauty all around me. So one point that I would like to add to this would be the dual issue of generosity and gratitude. And the first thing that I'd like to say then, that I am very grateful for you folks to come on and give me a chance to talk about this, that we share our gratitude. Then I'm very grateful for Dhamma Dude for what he's doing, Dhamma Das Dude, and Ivan and Ben, Santiago, Nick, Michael. You guys are all just so great.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker C:** And so that's the whole point about gratitude. If you have gratitude, you will also have generosity. That's kind of natural. But the way that we handle it within the Dharma is not by paying someone back, but rather paying it forward. Probably the most classic example of that is that you each one were raised by your parents, and you owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be paid. I got some wisdom. I got a whole new life based upon what Ajahn Po gave me, and I could never pay him back. What I'm doing with it instead is paying it forward by giving you the benefit of what I've got from him. And I don't expect any payback from you at all. I expect you, in fact, to pay it forward. But in fact, that's one of the things that I can see here now. I'm actually quite grateful for so many of you— Santiago and Bean, Ben and Ivan and Dhamma Dots and Michael, and especially Mikey and Josie too.

**Speaker A:** You're paying it forward.

**Speaker C:** Nick, thank you. So this is the way that we.

**Speaker A:** Deal with it, is that we When.

**Speaker C:** We are grateful for some gift that we've gotten, instead of trying to pay back, we pay it forward. In fact, let us say capitalism is a payback system. You go to Walmart, you get some item, you've got to pay them for it. You don't go to Walmart and pick up some item and then give it to somebody else and not pay for it. You got to pay for it with the payback system of capitalism. But within the noble Dharma, it's actually more of a social system in the sense that we don't pay back, we pay forward. So we can pay it forward. Any benefit that you get from the Dharma, you can go pay that forward. For instance, you've got somebody who comes and complains to you. Instead of getting hot and argue with them, you can just accept what they say. You can say, in fact, thank you for your complaint, I'll look into it. So let's see who else. Nick, do you have something to say?

**Speaker E:** This kind of reminds me of something I was thinking about today, which is like instant karma, where if you're in a good mood, you can send that to other people and it's going to bounce right back to you instantly. So Like if you also the other way works the same. So if you see someone as ugly, you're going to be in a bad mood and you're both just going to be exchanging negativity.

**Speaker C:** That's right, Nick. Let me say it this way. There is very little actual delayed Kamma. Almost always Kamma has an instant and somewhat opposite reaction, that Newton's Second Law of Thermodynamics was that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, and it's almost always instant. Go ahead, Mick.

**Speaker E:** [Speaker:Michael] I was just highlighting that instantaneousness.

**Speaker C:** Yes, Santiago, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Another thing is if you do things that are unwholesome, it might not immediately appear as though you're getting a result out of it, but you're reinforcing those unwholesome things and it's creating a cycle. So it's like you can run a red light once and not get fined, not run over somebody. But if you keep doing that enough times and enough times, You're gonna get caught up, and like that, that second or two seconds that you shaved off not waiting for the red light, you're gonna have to pay it back by getting in a car crash.

**Speaker C:** Yes, but when, when we say eventually it's going to catch up with you, that's missing an important point that it caught up with you already. Let me give you this example. It's a gross example, but we kind of get the point from it. I like really big, gross examples. I like being bad cop. So imagine there that you're in Walmart and that you think that they're priced too high for the widget that you want, and so you want to shoplift it. And you say, oh, I don't want to get caught. And so you do, you pull some maneuvers or whatever. There's various things that you can do, like just put it in your basket. And then when the cameras are not rolling or you're in a part of the store that has no cameras, like they generally won't put cameras in the linen section because who's going to shoplift linen? And so you put it in your bag or in your cart. And then when you get to the linens, pile where there's no cameras, then you take it out and you put it in your pocket thinking that you're going to get away with it. All right, now getting caught does not mean that you walk out of the store and there's the cop waiting on you. It's how do you feel when you're shoplifting. In other words, your mind is full of hindrances right then and there. I would say offhand that the part of the Kamma that makes it instant is because you're in the hindrance right then and there. You don't have— when your mind is hindered, when your mind is unwholesome, like I'm going to shoplift this, or I'm going to take it and get away with it— in fact, right then and there you feel bad. You've got a hindrance in your mind. And what is the hindrance? It's hindering you from feeling really good. If you can take that item that you were putting in your pocket and take it out and put it back on the shelf and walk out proud like, "I'm a good guy, I don't have to shoplift," then you're going to feel a whole lot better by not shoplifting than if you do when you do shoplift. That's also, by the way, exactly the same thing when you're about to complain. When you're complaining, you're already in hindrance. "Oh, I feel bad and I want to put my bad feelings out on someone else. Maybe if I can get them to commiserate with me, then I'll feel better." And in fact, what you did is you just had your own pity party and you invited a guest, and now you have two people in a pity party. But if you can say, "Wait a minute, let me look at that thought and recognize that that's an unwholesome thought. Let me drop that out of my mind." Well, I'll feel a whole lot better right right now, because I've thrown that hindrance out, or the doubt, or the worry, or whatever hindrance I've got in the moment right now. I get benefit by throwing that thing out right now. We can change our action, change our internal Kamma. Does that make sense for you, Santiago? All right. So generally, we can say it like this: there is internal behavior, which is actually more of thought process, the mind, and then there's external behavior. Normally, when you're around another person, all you see is their external behavior. You do not know what's going on in their mind, but they'll probably want to tell you. But in most circumstances, you don't know what's going on in anybody's mind. All you know is what their behavior is. But you have an opportunity that's double-sided like that, in the sense that you can see not only your own external behavior, you can see your own internal behavior if you'd only look. And your internal behavior is thought. And remember that thought, the mind, is the forerunner. You can't shoplift unless you're thinking about shoplifting. In fact, in that regard, you felt bad before you shoplifted. So the kamma and the result of kamma are backwards in that sense. You felt bad and then you did the bad deed, as opposed to doing the bad deed and then feeling bad. That you felt bad in advance. Funny how Kamma works like that. Most of the Kamma, most of the results of the Kamma is actually before the Kamma actually happens. You feel bad and then you act bad, because the mind is the forerunner. So Michael Swift, do you have a comment to make? No, I do not. It's good to see everybody. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker C:** Okay, Mr. Ben, what about you? Do you have something to say?

**Speaker A:** No, uh, no questions or comments, but the Thought it was good.

**Speaker F:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** And now I'm just grateful for you giving your— the Dhamma, your time, and everybody else. It's a really wholesome community to be a part of.

**Speaker C:** Go take your gratitude someplace else.

**Speaker A:** Will do. And pay it forward.

**Speaker C:** All right, so does anybody else have any last thing to say? There's a couple of people, but I don't know who their names are. RJ123, do you have something to say? How about you, Hagstar?

**Speaker A:** I have nothing to add.

### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Theme:** Every interaction is an opportunity to practice Dhamma. The talk focuses on applying mindfulness and right speech in all relationships, from spiritual mentors to strangers, with a special emphasis on overcoming the habit of complaining.

**Main Points:**

1.  **Hierarchy of Relationships:** The talk outlines a spectrum of relationships—family, ordinary friends, noble friends (spiritually advanced), *Kalyāṇa-mitta* (spiritual friend/mentor), and Arahants. While the dynamics differ, the **practice of Dhamma should be consistent across all.**

2.  **The Central Practice: Right Speech & Non-Complaining:**
    *   The primary tool for practice in relationships is **Right Speech**: avoiding lies, malicious gossip, harsh language, and trivial chatter.
    *   A major emphasis is placed on **eliminating complaining**. Complaining is identified as a key source of dukkha (suffering) and a major destroyer of relationships (e.g., a leading cause of divorce).
    *   The instruction is to use awareness of complaining—in ourselves or others—as a meditation object. When you notice it, you can change the topic, lighten up, or see it as "unwholesome mind state" to be let go.

3.  **How to Handle Others' Complaints:**
    *   **Don't "eat" the complaint:** Don't internalize or take ownership of someone else's negativity, like the Buddha in the story who refused to "accept" a visitor's anger.
    *   **Strategies include:** Silent acknowledgment (like Ajahn Po), walking away, or using a playful "Good Cop/Bad Cop" approach.
        *   **"Bad Cop"** points out the truth (e.g., "You're complaining").
        *   **"Good Cop"** offers nurturing and reassurance.
    *   This technique can be used skillfully within a spiritual community or even internally to wake oneself up from a negative state.

4.  **Dhamma in Daily Life & Vocation:**
    *   Practice isn't just for the cushion. The **best time to meditate is "right now,"** especially when facing difficulties: sickness, tiredness, worry, or conflict.
    *   One's job can be a field for Dhamma practice. The advice is to reframe any job (even bartender or cosmetologist) as an opportunity to help people feel better about themselves and reduce their suffering, rather than just performing the service.
    *   Some professions that inherently involve causing stress or delusion (e.g., certain political, legal, or sales jobs) were humorously suggested as incompatible with serious Dhamma practice.

5.  **Kamma (Karma) is Often Instantaneous:**
    *   The result of unwholesome action (like the intention to shoplift or complain) is not just a future consequence. The **hindered, unhappy state of mind that precedes the action is the immediate kammic result.** Letting go of that unwholesome thought brings immediate relief and freedom.

6.  **Gratitude and "Paying It Forward":**
    *   The talk concludes with the importance of gratitude for spiritual gifts (like the teachings received from a teacher like Ajahn Po).
    *   The noble response to such a debt is not to pay it back, but to **"pay it forward"** by generously sharing the Dhamma with others, thus fostering a compassionate cycle beyond capitalist exchange.

**Key Metaphors & Stories:**
*   **The Buddha and the Unwanted Meal:** Illustrates not accepting others' emotional "complaints."
*   **Good Cop/Bad Cop:** A strategy for wise and compassionate communication.
*   **Court Jester:** The role of humor and playful truth-telling.
*   **Shoplifting Example:** Demonstrates how the unwholesome mind state (the intention) is the immediate kammic punishment.

**In essence,** the talk is a practical guide to transforming all social interaction into a path of awakening by vigilantly applying Right Speech, eradicating complaining, meeting negativity with wisdom, and viewing every moment as the perfect time to practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Complaint Department:** Used to illustrate how we can handle complaints from others. Just as a complaint department employee is trained to listen without complaining back, we can learn to hear complaints without taking them on or reacting negatively.
2.  **Good Cop / Bad Cop:** A metaphor for two skillful approaches to helping others (or oneself). The "bad cop" directly points out the truth or a harmful pattern (like complaining), which can "wake someone up." The "good cop" then offers comfort, encouragement, and acceptance. The speaker notes this can be a spontaneous and effective teamwork dynamic in a spiritual community.
3.  **Court Jester / Joker:** Represents the role of someone who can tell a difficult truth in a way that avoids severe backlash. The speaker encourages becoming your own "jester" to playfully call out your own unwholesome mental habits.
4.  **Paying Forward vs. Paying Back:** Contrasts capitalist transactions ("paying back") with the Dhamma principle of gratitude. We can't fully repay our teachers or parents, so we "pay it forward" by generously sharing the benefits we've received with others.
5.  **Shoplifting Example:** A detailed metaphor for **kamma (karma)**, illustrating that the unwholesome mental state (the intention, the fear, the guilt) *precedes* and is the immediate negative result of the action. The "bad feeling" is the instant kammic consequence, not just the potential future getting caught.
6.  **Mirror:** Used literally and metaphorically. The speaker advises avoiding mirrors to not get caught up in judgments about physical appearance. More broadly, it suggests we shouldn't overly reflect on or critique our external "image," focusing instead on internal attitude.
7.  **Ain't it awful?:** A playful, metaphorical phrase offered as a tool to recognize and disarm one's own complaining mind by saying it in a humorous, singsong way.

### **Stories**

1.  **The Buddha and the Angry Man:** A story from the suttas where a man comes to the Buddha full of anger and complaints. The Buddha listens silently, then asks a question: if you prepare a meal for a guest who doesn't come, who owns the food? The man replies that he would. The Buddha then says, "Similarly, you have brought this meal of anger, and I am not eating it. So who does it belong to?" This story teaches not to accept or internalize the negativity others try to give us.
2.  **Ajahn Po and Complainers:** An anecdote about the speaker's teacher, Ajahn Po, who would respond to people's complaints with simple grunts and throat-clearing, offering no engagement. This story illustrates the power of not feeding complaints and allowing people to wear themselves out with their own negativity.
3.  **Personal GM & Walmart Story:** The speaker shares a brief personal experience about complaining to the point of swearing off GM products, only to later own them again. This is used to show how complaining often leads to rash decisions that we don't stick to, and how we can change our relationship with institutions (like Walmart's return policy) without drama.
4.  **The Bartender's Vocation:** A story about a community member who took a job as a bartender. The speaker reframed the job not as selling alcohol, but as an opportunity to help people feel good about themselves with *one* drink, potentially preventing deeper dissatisfaction and overconsumption. This story shows how any vocation can be approached as Dhamma practice.
5.  **Historical Context of Mirrors:** A brief reference to how mirrors in the Buddha's time were polished metal, rare and expensive. This contextualizes the Buddha's advice on mirrors and reinforces the idea that preoccupation with physical appearance is a modern, amplified distraction.

### **Overall Narrative Theme**
The talk weaves these metaphors and stories into a larger narrative: **Every human interaction is the meditation hall.** Whether with a spiritual mentor (Kalyāṇa-mitta), a family member, or a stranger, each moment is the "best time to practice" by watching one's speech, listening attentively, and choosing not to engage in or internalize complaints. The metaphors and stories serve as practical, memorable tools for implementing this principle.
